It's very strange that this dex concept is balanced by  economic mechanics.  It shouldn't work, but it really does.  I was very hesitant about this game for a while, but the glowing reviews here swayed me, and I'm glad I gave it a try.  Another well-crafted, well-produced Zoch game.

This is a cute tactical dexterity game.  The randomness of the spice orders is too dominant, which removes much of the strategy.  As a dexterity game for gamers, it's a little thin, but would probably work well as a family game.

Zoch do come up with some fantastic games by incorporating a physical challenge as well as a mental one. To date, some of their best have been designed for kids (Gulo Gulo takes some beating) but this was a pretty impressive innovation for adults.

Chucking the counters onto the board is frustating, aggravating event, but the blind bidding mechanic and the shortage of ingredients cards (and money) along with the clever balancing mechanisms in the buying and selling (and grabbing the pepper pot for first player) really make this a great game. Ideal for gamers who have had a few beers and want to play something lighter.

A set collection and dexterity game where you toss heavy poker chips to try to land on certain images on the board in order to win (by area majority) the right to buy items or take actions.  Naturally, you also try to knock opponents' poker chips off of nice items/actions.  The goal is to complete a certain number of recipe/order cards, some of which are public, while others are private recipes.  Luck of the draw can cause the game to drag if certain necessary ingredients just refuse to come out from the ingredient draw pile.  I also don't like the potential for fights regarding who cheated by crossing the invisible plane extending up from the edge of the board when tossing their chip.

You never learn to flip your coins good enough...but thats the  fun. So even the best tactic might fail to your unability to throw good enough. The game is really something different, and thats why People like it.

RATING: 6
Original dexterity based filler game. A shuffleboard mechanic that is used for gathering resources(spices) and set collection(recipe). There is an added layer of complexity in that the shufflepuck that you use determines the amount of money you pay/get for buying/selling the spice resource. There are also some extra action places you can target for some added fluff.

I like the dexterity part of the game, but the blind-bidding-somewhat-luck-based-shufflepuck combination and the calculation of selling price feels clunky and doesn't add to the fun I think. Still, for a filler game once in a while it's pleasant enough. Setup and play time is short so it's easy to get on the table.

It's a pretty game though. Nice and heavy discs and colourful art on the board and cards.

RATING: 9
I feel like those who have trouble getting this to the table are pitching it as "an economic game that is also a dexterity game." It really is more or less a dexterity game. It has set collection and money, something new players understand the basics of already, and is crazy fun. I went ahead with the purchase thinking this would be too complex to introduce to friends who don't play many games, but after playing I feel confident even my parents will love this.

RATING: 7
Nice dexterity game with gorgeous components. 
At first glance, the buy and sell rules seem to be a bit convoluted (for such a simple game), but everything comes together quickly in the first game.
I got the impression, that it became a bit stale in midgame (at least with not so talented players, as we were).
Might get old quickly, when the novelty of throwing poker chips onto a board wears off.

RATING: 7
Pretty cool mix of dexterity, stock holding, and set collection!  Essentially, players throw some discs onto a board, attempting to land them on spice symbols they'd like to buy.  The numbers on the discs dictate the buy/sell price for those spices for the round.  So, if you're looking to buy a spice, you probably are trying to throw a low chip on it, while you're looking to throw high chips onto spices you want to sell.  However, a player with the most money on a spice gets first crack at buying, and since spices are generally very limited, it can create a bidding war in which players are throwing chips at the same space, trying to outbid each other!

However, while you need money to get the spices you need, the game isn't totally about money.  The goal is to turn in certain sets of spices, dictated by some cards that show various spice combos.  If you can get the necessary spices, you trade them in for a card.  The first player to get X amount of cards wins!

Overall, a very simple but unique take on a pseudo stock system combined with set collection.  Very different from anything else I've played!

Excellent combination on Dexterity and Set Collection.  The one thing I would change are the scoring conditions.  I would play to a set amount of money, but turn the spice blend card completion into a sale and have it pay out the high end of the potential sum of its parts = $180.  FUN

Perhaps the most enjoyable family game that I have. We played four games this weekend (one 2-player, one 3-player, and two 4-player).  Thoroughly enjoyable and quite different from any other games in my collection.  The twins (now 9) and the wife absolutely loved it.  Dexterity, interaction, a bit of "take that"...gotta love it!

Enjoyable dexterity game where you fling plastic-coated metal discs onto an inlaid board, in order to land in bowls which allow you to collect resources that are then turned in to sets to fill orders, essentially.  It's the production that totally sells this game initially.  The best fun to be had when playing it is bumping other people around and edging them out.   It's a very simple idea and it works pretty well.  My only concern is that it could get pretty repetitive and the game might have a short shelf life, although the novelty factor could make it a keeper for some.

I picked up [thing=66849][/thing] at Essen 2013 as I had not seen it in the UK for some time.  And at last I got to play it.  It is a great game.  It is a dexterity game with some strategy thrown in.  You are collecting sets and what you can buy or sell depends on where your skimmed disc lands on the board.  There is enough skill to make the dexterity interesting whilst enough randomness to make it exciting.  WIth the added fun of being able to push opponents' discs off their winning positions and you have the final piece of a winning combination-jigsaw.  

Never has dexterity and strategy come together in such a wonderfully blended manner.

Safranito is a strange conglomeration of dexterity and economy. There are two distinct levels to Safranito; the first being a contest of accuracy, and the latter being a game of market exploitation. At first players simply try to land their chips on the board, buying at any price and opportunity. But once player's become more apt chip throwers the game steps up into a game of resource speculation. Players will accumulate and sell goods at high prices, since having the fattest wallet effectively gives you first dibs on valuable recipe-dependent spices. Once the game reaches this second level it becomes much more enjoyable, so give it a chance before you write it off.

Quality:  great.  Design:  great.  Fun for the occasional chance to play something different.  However, I don't tend to focus on dexterity-related games .... I'd rather focus on thinking about a strategic move in another game (not that strategy is absent here) than perfecting my toss to achieve what may have been a good strategic choice with Safranito.

I may not be good at dexterity games but that doesn't prevent me from enjoying them. I enjoyed Safranito, to the point where I nearly went out and purchased it. The colourful visuals are a definite contributor.

Unless you are a strategist who can't bear to see a plan go awry (with one bad toss), you should enjoy yourself here.

Ruben: Love the theme; fun flicking game. There's an advantage to being close to the free ingredient space if you play with stationary positions. 


Mel: I also love the theme, agree with Ruben regarding the free ingredient space. Too much of a pain to rotate the board, and not sure that's really a reasonable way to counteract the advantage, either. Still, a good selection for a change of pace.

I'm a huge dexterity game fan, but for some reason I I just wasn't feeling it with this one. Maybe I need to try it a few more times. I don't know. I really had high hopes for this game too.

The components are very nice. The poker chips are a nice heavy weight and have a hole in the center, so that you can judge if it's in one of the bowls or not, after being tossed onto the board. The edges of the board are even elevated to keep the chips on the board when thrown, which is very nice also.

Get the right spices at the right prices. That's the recipe for this wacky cooking-themed combination dexterity/economic game.

I bought Safranito mostly for its weirdness factor, but it has exceeded my expectations. It's been a big hit with the family, providing a relaxing blend of action, humor, and screwage, with a splash of strategy. I was afraid that the rules for buying and selling spices would be too game-y for such a light and silly game, but they aren't.

Here's a fun variant of Safranito I accidentally played once. Take it to your game group, tell them about it, and then when everybody is horrified and refuses to play, try to guess which people were put off by hearing "market manipulation" and which ones were put off by "dexterity game".

Sad fact: Even if you win at this variant, you don't get to play Safranito, which is too bad because it's medium-awesome.

Good fun.  At first I questioned a couple of rules (logic-wise), like having 6 different value pieces and being able to throw any you want, but once the game started and we played a round everything made good sense.  

Took much longer than I expected with 4, like 90 minutes instead of 30, but this was first game, 60 probably would be normal my guess.  Some dirt for sure, but all in good fun.  Board too big for 3 players, but then less things are available for sale so that would help. 

Overall a nice original dex game and the action spaces add some more nice tactical options. Note after 3 games my wife is frustrated from not doing well and told me to "sell it"!  Ouch  (She is not great at dex games)

So much fun, it elicited my first peer-judged review on this site. Not our first dexterity game, but certainly the first one that *really* clicked with us. So much fun to play - discs have a perfect weight to them for throwing, and the set collecting nature of the spices means that likely everyone's gunning for the rare ones when they come up, making the competitive blood surge. Add in some subtle strategy, and you have a winning game that I know is going to hit the table many, many times.

RATING: 6
A nice idea - I like the theme (which makes sense), the artwork and components, and the dexterity element.  It is a better game than Beer and Pretzels, but still suffers from a few defects that prevent it from being one of the greats.

The main problem is that there is too much luck of the draw - I can't see a situation where having lucky recipe cards coming up does not determine the winner.  I like that they tried to integrate a economic element in the game (buying/selling ingredients), but ultimately what matters most is getting recipes that conform to what you already have in hand (or can get in one round).

I also don't like the action that gives you your own private recipe.  This is way too powerful, since you are guaranteed access to that recipe, and no one can prevent you from achieving it.

Maybe I am being too demanding, since it is honestly a very light game, but I don't see it becoming a favorite.

A simple, elegantly designed dexterity game with just enough intrigue with the different values of chips. Drive up prices of ingredients your opponents need to mix a spice blend, buy low, sell high, knock out an opponent's piece and secure something else in one throw (or narrowly miss a crucial toss!), steal first player to complete a spice blend first that everyone could have finished--it's all surprisingly thrilling! Super easy to teach, and everyone gets into it, from hardcore board gamers to beginners alike. 

It's a game where the rules, gameplay, and interaction just flows together to feel so organic and inspired.

LIKE:

* Creative combination of a dexterity game (attempting to throw disks with money values on them onto bowls of spice to complete recipe cards).
* Knocking other people's disks off bowls is quite enjoyable; being knocked off - not as much!  :-) 

DISLIKE:

* Price is high - likely due to distribution.
* Game can take too long if people aren't all that talented in throwing the disks!

Another unique Zoch game. (Same publisher as Mord im Arosa. I'm definitely taking note of this publisher for fun, out of the ordinary games.) Beautiful dexterity game where you have to toss hidden bid disks onto the player board to complete recipe cards. Lots of knocking other player disks off key spots. You obtain ingredients when you are in the right spots at the end of the round, but money is tight, so you have to decide between buying or selling ingredients as well.

A rare gem. Incredibly fun. 
You get to flick poker chips of secret values, trying to hit the right spots on the board, outguessing the other players, hitting their chips away from their carefully chosen spots. Then, you shoot mean glances at the next player, who just thwarted your plan by a great shot.

This game was fun mainly because we are so bad at it. Every now and then we would get one on the actual board and maybe even in a useful spot. This is not a mark against the game just our skill at tossing chips. More skillful players may actually find it less amusing I don't know.

As a dexterity game, I'm impressed.  It's very similar to games like Catacombs except with far more decision making involved and easier to explain.  In short, it's a set collection game with hidden bids involved.  However, the trick is the bids aren't done by simply declaring them, but tossing your ships between the value 10 to 60 and tossing them into the desired spice.  This small change makes the game interesting and dynamic each game since the supply/demand of the spices fluctuates depending on the available recipes and how the players behave.

That being said, it might be too simplistic with for the heavier games but I wouldn't expect much based on a dexterity mechanic.  While Catacombs has denser rules in their dexterity game, it becomes extremely overbearing for a genre that is supposed to be lighthearted.  However, this is a great family game that should've received more attention.

My only suggestion is to use this house rule by the designer: If you want to buy a spice but the spice card isn't available, pay +20 and go through the deck (not discard) to retrieve it.  It increases the pace of the game to something more acceptable and suitable for the light mechanics.

Great dexterity game where players are trying to collect spices so they can build spice blends.  Each player has discs with values on the bottom between 10 - 60.  After everyone has thrown their disks spices that were landed on can be bought or sold.  There are a limited number of spices each round so buying privileges go to the player who's disk landed on that spice and was willing to pay the most (determined by the price shown on the bottom of the disc).  The prices of all the discs on a spice are totaled and players that did not buy that spice can now sell for the total price.

There are also 4 smaller spaces on the board with various powers.  Glad to see a combination economic-dexterity game work so smoothly.

An interesting game of collecting ingredients by flicking chips around the board. A dexterity game and set collection all in one. The board is put together by puzzle connection. It works fairly well, but does cause some bumps that disturb flicks of the chips. It is best played with as many players as can be had.

An unusual dexterity game with a recipe fulfillment (literally) element. Players are tossing discs onto a board which can grant them actions to buy and sell spices. When a player has the spices that complete a publicly displayed recipe, he claims it. First player to N (3 or 4?) recipes wins. It’s surprisingly hard to actually get the discs where one wants them. It was an interesting mix but neither the dexterity nor the economic aspects were particularly compelling.

A quick satisfying dexterity game that feels like no other. Lots of tense moments as you bump players off the actions they desperately need to finish a contract. I strongly suggest using a variant where you turn the board after every round, since the far corner is generally the easiest spot to throw to. There's even a small amount of bluffing in the game when you reserve hidden contracts. Safranito fires on all cylinders for me. One of the best surprises this year.

usually I love a dexterity element added to a euro game, but this mix didn't work for me.  There didn't seem to be any relation between the dexterity test and the trading mechanic, so it fell flat.

good basic idea - but very random and frustrating (to have 8 cards - and no dish with the right ingredients, OR you have a complete round, where only one player gets one ingredients, because most of  the others were kicked outside).
why?
luck, that the needed ingredients are revealed
luck, that nobody flip my coin out of the ingredient-area
luck, that nobody gets the dish before it´s my turn

update: try the house rule, that you can play any 2 ingredients instead of the needed one, when getting the dish .... - makes the game better ......

This is a dexterity economic set-collection game. Our game, with a lot of rules checks to make sure we got it right (although it's really not very complicated) took 37 minutes, which was a bit long for what this is. It's a weird combination of mechanisms -- you don't expect to see economics in a dexterity game (except Stack Market?) -- but it works pretty well. As long as the play time comes down some, this may get a few repeat plays. But it's likely not a long term keeper.

--- Summary ---
The board shows 9 spice bowls, and 4 action spaces. Players each have 6 poker chips showing their color on the back, and values 10-60 (10s) on the front. Shuffle the deck of spice cards (show 1 spice each) and spice combinations (3 spices per card). Each round, add x spice cards (5 in a 3er game) to market, and make sure there are y (2 in a 3er game) spice lots on display. Start with 200 rupees each.

Each round:
1. In turn order, toss 1 chip; go around z (4 in a 3er game) times. 
2. Next, evaluate the action spots -- these may allow you to get another toss, take a spice card from the deck, grab the top spice lot card as a private reserve, or immediately become the new start player. 
3. Then, resolve all the spice bowls in the order chosen by the current start player: reveal all chips in the bowl (if you can see the edge of the bowl through the hole in the center of the poker chip, it's considered "in"). Players may sell that spice for a value = sum of all chips in the bowl; if you sold, remove all your chips. Players who didn't sell, and who have chip in bowl, may now buy that spice if any are available; price = their highest chip, then remove that chip. Start with player with highest sum, repeating until no more spice of that type are in market.
4. In turn order, may fulfill one spice lot card on display and as many private reserve spice lots as you like (discard spice cards as indicated). The first player to take their 3rd spice lot immediately wins!

Crokinole: Spice Trader edition. Weird game of tossing chunky poker chips onto board spaces to get actions and buy or sell spices. Collect spices to match recipe cards, and first player to claim 3 recipes wins.

For such a light / random game, it has a fatal death-spiral: if you run out of cash you have to choose an action that enables you to sell a card, and naturally that’s the one place where you won’t be able to (or allowed to) toss a chip. In its most extreme form, you can have no cards and no cash, and then you’re almost completely stuffed.

I enjoyed the first play, but my opponent ran out of cash and hates the game with a passion.

This is really a simple concept at heart, but in classic Zoch style, they have produced a wonderful looking (and feeling) game and everything works well and is nicely polished. The selling rules for example, tie everything together and put just enough restrictions in place.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
I freely admit that I played this expecting not to like it, but it turns out that the combination of dexterity and blind bidding ends up improving both. 

Safranito is a set-collection game where players have to toss bid chips (face down) onto a board, having them land over certain printed bowls of spices in order to have the right to purchase them. Bid order matters, since you there could well be less of a spice than the players require. 

The board works well, cardboard with a shallow ridge around it, so careful players can use bounces to more precisely position their bid chips, naturally you can bounce other player's bids around although there are few enough chips in play that this isn't the primary activity.

There's a bit of randomness in what scoring set cards come up, but you can go after the special power that gets your your own bid cards. You have only finite money, so you may need to sell some spice you've collected at inflated prices (here priced based on everyone's chips) to finance other purchases, so the the slightly different values different players put on spices (to complete sets they are close to) can play a role, too.

This is a pretty good game. You throw discs into play to bid for the ability to buy or sell spices. The spices can be sold for money, or bought for money. Collections of spices can be discarded to score spice-mix cards. There's enough going on in the game to create an interesting set of choices and it may almost be playable without the disc throwing (although pushing someone else's disc out of a spice bowl is part of the fun of the game).

Safranito certainly is an original game, even for today's standards. Throwing the heavy quality discs is really fun, and the buying/selling mechanic adds some tactical depth to the proceedings. Throwing precisely is harder than you think, however, and the game may well outlast its welcome in terms of gamelength if the players lack skill in this department. I am still wondering if this skill is going to improve with more practice. All in all a game with fantastic components and fresh gameplay that is quite enjoyable as long as it doesn't take more than 45 minutes to an hour to play.
UPDATE: Good medium filler if you have less than an hour to spare and want to play a dexterity game that is not just about dexterity.

I give Safranito a 7, but not because I love the game.  It's a Euro dexterity.  It might be the only such game.  It has gorgeous artwork.  Combine the three and it's a good game.

Certainly more going on here than a typical dexterity game!

Wonderful components and some moderate fun.

I am not a fan of dexterity games. This one has players tossing poker chips on the board to collect cooking items. The items are then used to complete recipes. It is better than I thought. Some people will really enjoy it.

Klingt ganz lustig ... letztlich ein taktisches Schnippspiel mit schöner Grafik. Sicher etwas für Bilstein.

Lightweight fun. I am still not sure if there is enough competition for spices but it gets plays due to the great appearance and fun throwing mechanisms.

art looks great, but i'm not a big fan of dexterity games. No real way to catch up, and the 'selling' part is pretty dangerous: you want to have multiple high ones end up in the same bowl.

A good mix of game types: dexterity with a Euro feel. There are quite a few strategies in this game too; like loading up a spot to sell, when to go low and when to go high, multi-buys, going for the special ability spots (especially head chef). Very fun, surprising this game doesn't have more buzz or even released to the US.

A lighter game about collecting spices in an indian market.  While on the surface this appears to be primarily a dexterity game where you are tossing your chips on to the board to get what you need (and bumping other folks off their spots...) there is a good money management gamer here too! This still seems light enough for family play but I think there is enough here for a light change of pace gamer's game. 

We love Indian food and I think this will be a fun one for the family once everyone is old enough to grasp the money concept.  In the mean time I've put together a "kid's variant" ignoring the money.  Whoever gets the highest sum of chips on a spot gets that ingredient then we complete one of the many (twice as many per player as shown on the chart) recipes until someone gets 3 and wins!

Become the master of spice in Safranito where you become a chef buying and selling spices to create unique spice blends in a disc flinging dexterity game!

Pure fun. De amusementswaarde telt mee in de beoordeling van een spel, daarom een dikke 8 voor dit zeer inventief, origineel spel, een massa spelplezier, eindelijk een topper van Zoch...

Played this twice (solo) in order to get the rules down, and I must admit that this is a light but complex Euro. I must say that I enjoyed it, but didn't find it to be anything particularly special -- yet.

There are areas that remain untapped, however... thus the reticence to deliver anything final about the game from my personal perspective. The key point is that it was enjoyable. That's what counts.

9/6/2013: Probably have 20 plays under my belt (solo only, surprisingly). This is a fantastic game with a variable timer element that is delightfully frustrating. I have to say that this is quite the interesting little title, and I see both simplicity and depth at the same time.

I find the game reminds me of Finca. The theme is benign, there is just enough uncertainty (weather and blind cube draw) to provide some "thrills and chills," and plays in under an hour. A beautiful title.

Only had one two player game so have resisted the urge to mark Snowdonia a 10. But yes, it's that good and I feel sure that future plays will lead me to take it up a notch. The only thing wrong with the game is the cloth bag - it's too narrow so becomes a bit fiddly searching for the correct cubes. A well themed placement game with multiple scoring routes and lots to think about. A tremendous achievement and my favourite of my Essen games so far.

Update - this is tremendous - and so it goes up to a 10. Had a great 2 player game the other night - knew it was close and decided to close the game early and won by just one point with 123. Nailbiting. Really can't praise this game enough.

Just 2 plays, but that was sufficient. I like the theme and vibe. But my plays showed a bit of repetitive feeling as we marched around the recipe cards. The engines were fought over and one seemed particularly better. Not much really to complain about, but nothing memorable either.

RATING: 6.5
Decent, heavyish Euro with a good theme. Nothing we haven't seen before but holds together well. Very long set up time and quite involved to learn, but not that tough to play. I like the weather mechanic - hey, reminds me of North Sea Oil (there's a blast from the past!)  The fact that events speed the game along and it all seem to move forwards is in its favour. This game eats sheep, but I wouldn't buy it (though I would be happy to play it again).

A well-designed worker placement game that doesn't overstay its welcome.  It's got a lot of moving parts, and in many ways feels "Wallace-y."  A drawback for me is that it's just not that innovative.  Plus the theme never drew me in.  I'd play it again, but I probably won't buy it.

An okay train game.  Sort of.  I don't like how dirt runs out and, thus, is a valuable commodity.  I like the variable scoring.  I almost don't like how the game eats things up as it goes along, though that is a nice incentive not to sit on your butt.  I dunno.  There's just not enough there to make me want to play this one more.  *shrug*

1st play: Not quite decided how I feel about this game.  In my first play it was rainy and foggy for the first 5 or 6 rounds, and the track building was VERY slow.  There weren't many actions to take, and we ended up with our surveyors halfway up the mountain.  The game appears to scale very well.

2nd play: The second play was better.  Fast, lots of decisions, and once everyone knows how to play, plays in an hour.  I especially like that the expansions have slightly different mechanics, and the rounds are lightning fast.

Excellent light/medium worker placement game with great components and many cheap expansions that take the replayability to an infinite level! Great work from Tony Boydell! I recommend this to any one. I like it more than Stone Age or Lords of Waterdeep for entry level gamers. It's new/casual player friendly but has the elements for the more experienced ones to love this one as well. It plays well with every player count, what more to ask from a game? Simply brilliant!

At base, Snowdonia is a pretty basic worker placement and resource conversion game.  A few things add interest.  First, there are no individual player boards (hurrah!); we are working together to build a railway line to the top of Mount Snowdon.  The second thing is the events that kind of add a dummy player who drives the pace of the game, particularly if we sit on piles of resource cubes.  Finally, there is the changeable Welsh weather that creates opportunities for rapid gains and dictates slower turns.  Contracts offer different v.p. objectives and special abilities.

While I'm bored with worker placement and never loved resource management, Snowdonia puts them in a setting that's a bit fresh, quirky and thematic.

Production quality is good and the artwork is quite pleasing.

RATING: 10
Fantastic worker placement game that scales well with all numbers of players.  Very good solo mode, too.

There are so many variables in this game that every game can be vastly different.  Weather, contract cards, trains, and event cubes all happen at different times and offer different strategies.

One big key is managing the resources.  Players need to be aware of how many cubes are left in the bag as the less there are, the more likely it will be that one or more event cubes will come out making the game speed up track and station building and depriving players of points.

Besides the two scenarios in the base game, there are a good amount of expansion scenarios which offer completely different experiences.

Tony is also very generous in providing printable 'promo' cards which also add (often humourous) diversity to the game.

A rather unique worker placement (which seems like a oxymoron at this point).  I like it a lot and we'll see if it ages well.  My first play was rather painful since I didn't recognize the need to be as efficient as possible.  That and the fact that the player to my left kept choosing first player to my detriment for nearly the entire game.  (This happened mainly because we got one of the rules wrong.....)

This is a nice worker placement game with some clever and enjoyable mechanics.  I really like the rubble mechanic which causes some nice timing issues decisions, as well as, interestingly, affecting the length of the game.  The phantom player mechanic is a tough one to really love, but I actually enjoyed it.  The weather mechanic seemed to work nicely as well.  All in all, a very nice, cleverly quirky, addition to the worker placement family of games.

A solid gamer's game, not overly complex. It has theme and a refreshing uniqueness. 

My first game (2-players) took about two hours, as not many white event cubes (which spur the game on) appeared while lots of fog (which hinders progress) did. Final scores were very high (173-166) and margin of victory very small. 

My first 4-player went well, and fairly quickly. There was no analysis paralysis as feared, and the scores were very close: 73, 75, 83, 88. Interestingly, the two highest scorers never bought a train. Snowdonia is very balanced; if you perform one action to get points, you forgo other points. The winner pursued an "excavate and move surveyor" strategy. He was helped by the weather--nothing but sunshine for the first 95 percent of the game--and a lack of excavation by the rest of us.

To my taste, this is a nice, straightforward game that isn't too "busy" (like Hawaii, Tzolkin, Bora Bora, for example) and has just the right number of ways to get VPs.  Rating would be higher if it were a little less "dry" and had a greater excitement level.

Very interesting worker placement, medium weight Euro, you're clearing and building tracks up Welsh mountains, scoring stations, fulfilling contract for victory points, and acquiring a train which will grant you extra abilities. Resources are tight, and a bag is used for drawing new ones, so there is some tension here as you scrap over the materials you'll need. I enjoy the Weather mechanic, which determines which actions will be used in a round, as well as the presentation of the board, with the rows of cards that represent the track set up around the edges. Also includes an advanced play variant and a Solitaire version.

2/15/2015: Notes for the wagons: 
https://boardgamegeek.com/blogpost/37817/oh-k

They are all available in a game (see special note for 1h).

 You build these wagons just like you would build a Train and, like trains, you can build them only when the Train event has occurred.

 You do NOT need a train to build a Wagon; there is no limit to the number of Wagons you can have.

 Train maintenance has NO effect on Wagons thumbsup

 Wagons are additional game-end scoring cards; score them BEFORE you score everything else (apart from the Rubble Wagon - 1e) ie. you may end up using your scoring markers for a Wagon AND for a Contract card!

 I haven't actually play-tested these at all, TBH; I got caught up in the excitement of it all and just went with it.

So, what do they do?

 1a - Freight Wagon: 1 point for each iron ore, coal and stone still in other players' (NOT your) personal supply at the end of the game ie. if they're inefficient, you profit!

 1b - Stone Wagon: 2 points for each Stone requirement space you have completed in stations during the game.

 1c - Ballast Wagon: 3 points for each Excavation requirement space you have completed in stations during the game.

 1d - Steel Wagon: 3 points for each Steel requirement space you have completed in stations during the game.

 1e - Rubble Wagon: You MUST assign rubble to score on your Contract card(s), if possible; any surplus rubble is worth 1 point each.

 1f - Guard's Van: At the start of resolving Action A, you may place one of your assigned workers on to this card to score 7 points at the end of the game.

 1g - Milk Wagon: If you hold the Start Player marker at the end of the game, gain 8 points.

 1h - Passenger Car: Gain 3 points for each other Surveyor you are ahead of along the direction of the track (ie. does not work, and is not used, in the Blaenau Ffestiniog scenario). On the same station is NOT 'ahead of'!

 1i - Hopper Wagon: Gain 3 points for each Coal you have at the end of the game.

 1j - Beer Tank Wagon: Gain 4 points for each Contract card you are able to successfully score at the end of the game.

I found the theme cute, and it seemed to be well integrated with the game mechanics. But there was nothing I found particularly new about it, and in the end I wasn't left feeling that interested; another victim of my current jadedness with eurogames. 

I disliked the way the game events dug over a third of the rubble spaces available, so that the digging was finished in a timeframe that felt way too fast. My game was possibly affected by the fact the weather was good almost all the time though, so maybe this can be different if this isn't the case.

That said, it plays fast, flows well, and it's probably not a bad choice for a thematic, fast worker placement game.

Lovely worker-placement game, with a great engine, and wonderful design aesthetics. Doesn't seem to play as swiftly as promised, but still churns along nicely, with a decent mechanism for the game never stalling. Love the weather predictions. 
On the negative side, setup takes quite long, and there's some rule ambiguities about contract cards. I also find I don't much care for the theme, and for the longest time had very little desire to actually get this to the table. In retrospect, this was primarily caused by attempting to play it with 2 players a couple of times, where the game seriously underwhelms. It turns out to be a much more solid and enjoyable experience with 4 or 5.

Snowdownia is a medium-weight worker-placement game with a great amount of variability/replayability.  As expected with any good euro, the game allow players to plan out their actions rounds ahead.  But what makes this game unique is the fact that players aren't only playing each other but also the game. 

Now normally, the random nature of the dummy player isn't something I like in games.  But with the exception of being unable to pay the train cost early on (which means you need to return the train back), I feel like the dummy player actions are predictable and mitigatable.  

If I had to fault the game, there are two issues I would highlight.  First, the rulebook is one of those that seems to make perfect sense until you start playing the game and start having questions; long story short, the wording is often imprecise/inconsistent (this may have been corrected with later editions).  Secondly, I no longer crave this game with small player counts.  This is a game that becomes more intricate and interesting with higher player counts. 

But for a medium-weight euro that borders on a game for casual gamers and gamers alike... there is a lot to appreciate in this design.

My thoughts after one play, a five-player. Beautifully nuanced mechanics, I was amazed at the range of choices despite having just two workers to place for much of the game. The turn sequence mechanic makes for some tough decisions in determining what to do, and when to do it, and creates a high level of player interaction. Definitely will play again, there's lots to explore here and I feel I've just scratched the surface.

Played for the first time at Essen 2013.  A great worker placement game with some interesting mechanics - I particularly liked the pressure to work from outside contractors and the weather.  It left me quite surprised that this game had not been better received by the community.  The current version ships with attractive worker pieces, replacing the old wooden counters.  Furthermore it has great scope for replay-ability with a wide range of low cost expansions available adding additional scenarios.

Vannak a játékban jó ötletek, összességében tetszik. De! A 45 perc kamu, nekünk 2 óra 20 perc volt, sokadjára se nagyon tudom elképzelni 1 órán belül. Nincs ezzel baj, csak akkor ezt írják rá, és ne abból induljanak ki, hogy mindenki csak ezzel játszik naphosszat:) Az egyik legnagyobb ötlet a játékban a fehér kockák szerepe, amivel automatikusan is történnek dolgok: ezáltal egyrészt nem húzódhat el a végtelenségig, mert ha senki se csinál semmit, a játék akkor is felépíti helyettünk a sínt előbb-utóbb. Másrészt ez eléggé be is kavarhat, nagyon megemeli a szerencsefaktort, nem árt ha van B ill. C tervünk is. Az időjárás is be tud kavarni. Egyáltalán nem rossz játék, de nem lesz szerintem nagy kedvencem.

Snowdonia is an unusual worker placement game, because it is very thematic: you can almost feel the struggle against the mountain and the weather, and the players are in fact playing against each other and against the game at the same time (there is a mechanic that builds the railway by itself).
The game is very tight, and is very enjoyable if you are "into" worker placement.
I am eager to play it again with more players, but initial tentative rating is a solid 6.5.

This is an excellent medium weight worker placement game. I'd put it halfway between Ticket to Ride and Agricola as far as complexity or [i]friendliness[/i]. There is enough variation in play to keep it interesting over time. Additionally, there is an advanced rule variation included with the base game and a few interesting expansions already on the market.

Nice workerplacement game with a lovely theme. In the whole of workerplacement games this one jumps out, because it plays different. Mostly an extra worker is better for the rest of the game, here you have to work hard to maintain that extra worker.

Truly Amazing game.
Wow!
I would say this is a perfect gateway game, can teach (and have) new none gamer players in 10 minutes flat....
Yet what incredible depth this gem of a game has!, you see what the game has to offer the more you play, it just gets better and better, every turn can be an agonising choice where you place your worker.
If you don't like train games - don't worry!, this is more a worker placement economic building game, yes your building the mountain railway up the majestic mount Snowdon.
Not only do you have to concentrate on your opponents actions, the game plays itself in a way I have never seen before - it's extraordinary.
Plenty of expansion and promo decks to keep the game fresh for years.
Love it, love it, love it!.

The changing weather was neat as that can influence how players approach the game. Managing the weather and adjusting your actions to today's weather and what is coming in the next few days is neat. White cubes cause the game to "speed things up" (as it was explained to me) and that's a nice twist.  It's pretty random how fast this is going to happen, so I like that each game will probably play differently.  Locomotives and cards provide another way to twist the rules a bit (and score end-game bonuses). So, I saw many different ways for this game to play out differently. Some are player-controlled and some are controlled by the game, but none of them appear to be game-breaking. I wasn't blown away by Snowdonia. I did enjoy it and I see opportunity for future plays that will be fun and different each time. For me, another thing that makes this one a winner is its approachability. I expect my family shouldn't really have any trouble sitting down and playing this one.

I give this game a strong 7 rating.  I'm not sure it will climb to 8, but the fact that it worked so well as a 2 player game for my wife and I gives it a big plus.

After 6 plays, I've moved my rating up to an 8.  This game is a medium-light Euro... a big part of the appeal for me is how different each game plays out depending on the weather and how the white cubes keep the game moving along.  Though it seems to get mixed reviews from others, it deserves an 8 for me.

Despite boring, dry, uninspiring and horrible to look at, Snowdonia still has an edge on your average eurogame: it only takes half the time such slogs usually force on you, which makes it a little more bearable than its ilk.

Unique worker placement game.  You are gathering resources for the most part but you don't have to go that route to earn points.  I like how it allows you to be creative.  Yeah, that is something I really like in games, the freedom to explore.  It's also a pretty quick game and I would imagine it scales pretty well.  I only played with five.  What I like is the RA timing element in the game.  Drawing white cubes moves the game along with various events.  That keeps the pressure on and keeps you on your toes.  The winner in the first game we played had bonus cards.  That is big and we all knew that going in.  One guy managed to get cards and score big on the bonuses.  Looking forward to playing again, sooner than later.

I have only played this once (2 player). We enjoyed it, but neither of us were blown away. We found our game to be a bit repetitive. There weren’t a whole lot of events (either by chance or because we never let the bag get too concentrated with events) and so it felt like the same few actions over and over without too much tension. I didn’t dislike the game, and I would be interested in playing some of the expansions, but it went from my “To Buy” list to my “Glad to have tried” list after this one play.

A euro with theme - lots I like in this, and a few bits I'm not so keen on.

Weather is clever, and you get enough of a forecast to plan, worker placement but with just 2 (or 3 if you get a train so you can drag the lazy wotsit out of the pub) it rolls along quite quickly.

Theme of building the railway is nice, and the artwork is suitably dreary :)

Bits I'm less keen on. Random event cubes out of the bag can be rather chaotic (yes you can manage the risk a bit), I think I'd prefer it if a maximum of 1 event can trigger in a turn - but that's easy to house rule.

Other is the turn order swap - *if* the person going first wants to stay going first they can. Most of the time they won't as going earlier on the grab stuff box is better.

But overall, liked it much more than I was expecting too.

** Update, wasn't being played, then tried it again and the bits I don't like felt more significant, either that or I was grumpy that night. Now traded, but I'd play it again.

A well put-together medium-light worker placement game with my favorite theme (trains).  The game was well tied into the theme which should make it fairly simple to teach and I also liked how the games pushed things along.  It was a 2-player game and I suspect the game would be more fun (and meaner) with more.

This is my first played Essen 2012 game and on the strength of this alone I'd consider it a successful year.  It is so refreshing to find a game that is 'different'.  Not totally different maybe but sufficiently different to bring a bit of fresh air into oft encountered identical game systems.  My compliments to the designers for latching onto what must be accepted as an unusual theme, sticking well to that theme but at the same time making a very original game out of it.  The fact that our very hardbitten and severely crtical group has asked to play the game again next week says it all.

I really like the basic worker-placement mechanic, which is very cleverly designed. You often have to time your actions just right, putting pressure on other players and trying to get both spots you need so that one worker's action will allow your other worker in the next space to do something else. Turn order becomes crucial, and really ratchets up the tension during the placement phase.

My biggest problem with the game has to do with the end conditions. The notion that the game may or may not end this, or the next, or the next, or the next turn is so frustrating and stupid that it nearly ruins the game for me, and frankly I don't understand why it's there. Because you often need two or three turns to construct something, having an uncertain number of turns at the end is annoying, because you don't want to start a new project you can't finish. If the game fails to end, however, you might find yourself with wasted turns because you thought it was over. 

UPDATE: Rating has dropped. I still love the tense WP and resource management elements of the game, but I'm beginning to hate the stupid bag. Are you planning a big move? Sorry, that track just cleared because two white cubes were drawn unexpectedly. Did you save up for two turns to get that nice new train? Too bad, a surprise train maintenance just lost you your train, and thus your last four actions were wasted. Ha ha. 

Imagine Agricola, but with the possibility of a harvest coming any turn, without warning, depending on an unlucky draw. That's what Snowdonia feels like to me. No thanks.

First two games were a real contrast, with the first in almost constant sunshine (like our own holiday in Wales last year) which meant that the neutral company really pushed the game on - clearing three or four track cards at a time - whereas the second was almost all rain - with only one foggy and one sunny day - which really slowed the game up and meant it dragged a bit. Rather good on first impression, and may well be even better - I suspect further plays will confirm that to be the case.

I kind of liked Snowdonia, and this rating could really move either way with some more plays. Standard worker placement with some twists. The weather is a cool element, but I worry about it being rough with a lot of bad weather up front. Seems like that would engender lots of resource hoarding, lots of white cubes and lots actions taken by the game. Maybe experienced, quality play can mitigate that - not sure. Also seemingly has the endgame problem where whether endgame scoring cards pop up late that can be easily fulfilled can swing the game, though the fact that resources can't be used over multiple cards may mitigate that. Lots of questions. Game has potential though.

Update: played a game with terrible weather to start and the way the game handles this is excellent. The game still played in 90 minutes with 5 players which is amazing when excavating 0 or 1 cube every round. In fact, the variety with the weather and the way the white cubes (dummy player) come out is the chief strength of the game. There is a lot of variety in how the game plays out, and there are a lot of different avenues to pursue that seem balanced, but this doesn't degrade from competition over a very limited series of spaces. And there is lots of fun playing chicken with track laying and excavating - metagame heaven. I do not like the turn order- like Agricola, too much luck in whether the person to your left or right is interested in taking that often. And there is a minor issue with objective cards coming out toward the end that can be easily filled. This is not game breaking here like in takenoko, but slightly annoying nevertheless.

And there are some fiddly rules and timing things that can be very easy to forget, though the rules are simple.

What a great worker placement game, it's a shame it took 3+ years for me to finally get this to the table. I love how the game pushes forward with the event cubes and this engine feels so unique in that it is not always just the players driving the game forward and forces everyone to not stagnate. The contract cards giving you one time use powers, the engines which are more permanent powers, and the weather which shifts some of the power of the actions all gave this game a real dynamic and unique feel to it. Between all of the expansions and promos the variability is there in spades and I don't think this one will ever leave my collection.

Not sure how much play it will see, but certainly a fun game.

Love it! A worker placement game that is fairly straight forward to learn. Players are working together to build a train line up Snowdon Mountain (the highest peak in Wales). Yet each is working alone to collect the most points at the end of the line. There are some clever game mechanics being used. And there is enough going on to keep you on the edge of your seat yet it's never overwhelming.  It also has an addictive quality that is wonderful. The turn angst is fantastic. The set up is a bit fiddly and the game feels slightly more 'clumsy' with 5 players. (It's markedly harder to get things done with more players.) But still it's a really great game with little that I can complain about.

I'm not entirely sure what to make of this worker placement game, but I think I'm ultimately lukewarm on it. In it players take turns trying to clear rubble, erect buildings and train track, and setting up bonuses for their end game scoring while also trying to avoid bad weather and government deadlines.

I'm not really sure that there is anything here that I haven't seen 100 times before at this point. There are a couple of cube types, there is a location to transmute each type into another type. There are a limited number of spaces that means timing can be important, and there is a way to expand your worker roster to gain extra actions. Players also draft special cards that give them one shot powers and incentives to build certain combinations of track and buildings during the game.

One benefit of this title is that it has some timing nuances because of the rubble mechanic where tiles start out covered in it which requires removal before track and buildings can be placed on them. This means that players have to pay some attention to the order in which actions are being carried out. Another is that there is a mechanic in place that hurries the game along if players are not building things efficiently, which can sometimes be a problem with meatier worker placement games.

However, in summation, I don't really think there is anything here than hasn't been done many, many times before and I couldn't recommend playing it over other, more standard picks like Agricola or Le Havre.

Thoroughly pleasant, with good choices to make in game.  Although I somewhat dislike the term "gateway game", this is probably a good example of such a game.  The rules are straightforward enough for "new" gamers to understand, but, as stated, there is plenty of strategy available.  

Nice expansions exist which can vary the game up in different fashions to keep things interesting over the course of many plays.

Place workers to gather goods, cards, convert goods, or build rails or stations using goods.  Cards are used to set a weather track, which determines how much excavation and rail building can be done in a round.  Cards confer a special privilege that may be used once per game.  Cards are also used to score end game victory points, if you've met the conditions.  For example, having a certain number of rubble, stations, rails, etc.  Having built a locomotive confers the ability to gain an extra worker, should you choose to buy that worker in the round.  A station master confers end game points based on how far they've scouted.

Plays very differently as 2-player game.  End game bonuses conferred by cards are much harder to obtain with 5 players.

Though I despise the cog railway on Mt. Washington, I'd very much like to have the Mt. Washington expansion.  I prefer my mountains without buildings, roads, or rails.  I do love the rock pile, despite these things, so of course I'd like a game about the highest peak of the WMNF.

Played a 5-player at Connon 2013.  I was first player and though I didn't win, I felt that I had an advantage, especially with the other players getting no resources or any other kind of consolation to NOT going first.  I'm pretty sure that one bad placement at a key time cost me the win.  Still, a lot of fun and plenty of interesting decisions!  I would love to play this again.  One complaint = why is there fog in the weather, but no snow?  A strange oversight to say the least.

RATING: 8
In hindsight, I really can't think of what is so special about this game, but somehow it really clicks for me. [i]Very[/i] by the books worker placement / resource conversion game.  But there's a sequence of many contract cards which come out that really gives the game its texture. Every card has both a onetime benefit (I like that it's not once per round; you're not building engines here, pun intended; ok, actually, yes, you can build a single train engine, but of course I meant you don't build snowballing economic engines), and an end-game scoring condition. The endgame scoring conditions are a significant portion of your score (or should be), so they're important. But the cards are also pretty easy to get. So it's about choosing just as many as you need, and choosing the right ones to mesh with what you're doing. 

And that's just the base game. Still haven't tried the expert mode. Base game seemed fine for first couple plays.

Eagerly looking forward to getting the expansion as well. All kinds of goodness.

Snowdonia is a very polished and very processional example of the worker placement genre anno 2013. There are a few cute tricks in the design dealing with the weather and somewhat merciless game clock which pushes along the game nicely. It has a functional but ultimately quite boring subject... That is, to a non-Welshman. And that with me boasting the national Welsh cat breed for my avatar :meeple:. In any case, whereas the author and the design group did an admirable job in making the game tick nicely and smoothly along, there isn't a sense of progression as you create the railway line to the summit of Mount Snowdon. Excavation near the summit is just as easy or as difficult as it was down in the vale. Stations are just cards with slightly different numbers on them. Weather conditions just move two markers up and down a pair of tiny tracks. The only thing I genuinely liked was the fact that your third worker is permanently stuck in the pub unless you draw him out with black cubes (which I visualised to be the local stout) and a train so the drunkard can commute his bum to the place where work needs to be done. Unfortunately, this detail cannot support between 60 and 90 minutes of point gathering through mild resource conversion.

In the end there isn't anything wrong with Snowdonia. There isn't much that stands out, either. And that, plus the bland arc from start to finish more or less seals this title's fate for me. I cannot decide whether to go for a 4 or a 5: the 4 is warranted for not attempting to do something crazy and keep the game without real tension from start to finish; the 5 is warranted because it all flows smoothly. I settled on 4, because I want designers to be more bold in their work.

RATING: 8
A light worker placement which doesn't overstay its welcome due to the random event track which speeds the game along. One play isn't enough to really explore the game, as the random weather and resource hording could make the game quick and easy or utterly painful. Rules should have a guide so that players could gauge how many points is a good score.

Really good worker placement game. Initially it looked overwhelming because there are a lot of parts and unique looking mechanices to the game. But it took about 6-8 turns to understand it.

Thanks to a very generous 2013 Secret Santa!

Snowdonia is one of the best worker placement games and will become a classic in the genre for me. Great artwork combined with interesting decisions/actions where some of what you do will go to help the other players. Reasonable playing time and able to be played from 1-5 players. Delightfully fun game to play. Highly recommended.

Rating has been a solid 8 since my first play, although it's floated a s high as "9", it remains forever a solid and highly enjoyed 8 in my books.

Rulebook is not so great, but the game is pretty good.

Players compete to clear the mountain pass and build the train track to the summit. Along the line, they also compete at locations where stations are to be built.

Add in a clever twist of varying weather and a somewhat difficult way of getting (and keeping!) an extra worker, and you've got a worker placement game that's not just more of the same.

My rating might even go up a bit. (On my first play, a perfect storm of inopportune things happened back-to-back, just devastating my chances... but some of these could have been avoided and others were just really unfortunate coincidences. It all left me a little shell-shocked, but I'm eager to play again, so that says something.)

For two players, it checks in at about 90 minutes, which is a little too long for me. I'll be more likely choose one of many shorter, similar games.

Base game is a 7 (contract card balance and optimal strategy issues), the Jungfraubahn & Mt. Washington deck improves it somewhat.

Edit: Has not stood the test of time. Almost impossible to get a game this ugly to the table. No one wants to play it. Add to that the fact that it is straight worker placement with nothing unique or compelling about it - no hook. A further annoyance is that the board is not only huge and completely unnecessary, the cards actually sit around it! Baffling design choice.

If there weren't literally dozens of better WP games available it would be possible to overlook Snowdonia's shortcomings. 

Sold.

I have problems with the amount of looking around the table you need to do in order to play your turn, and how doing that turn after turn could really slow down play.  But by and large it's fine, if unexciting.

RATING: 7.75
The game is composed of most of the gaming mechanisms which I have grown to dislike - worker placement/action selection, cube-conversion, bonus VP collection - but somehow I end up liking it.

Why? - well the game has a lot of charm and I am inclined to like the theme which is engaged by the game mechanics. Despite this it never quite escapes from being the rather dry gamers game that worker placement always results in, but it does disguise it well.

A couple of negatives - don't play with 5, it makes the game run too long and is more unforgiving, although some will like the latter aspect, but I don't.

Also the special effects of the contract cards are pretty crucial in playing the game, but they are detailed in smallish text which is unreadable from across the board - so, until you have played many times and know all of the cards (and there are quite a few) the person sitting next to the card row has an advantage.

Players run a team of Navvies, constructing the railway up Mt Snowdon, in Wales.  Straightforward worker placement game, where players take turns to position their two workers on action spaces, then the actions are resolved.  The railway is a path of alternating track and station cards around the perimeter of the game board (the board is just a large holding space for components).  The railway comes pre-loaded with rubble, which must be cleared before the track can be laid (with iron).  Station buildings can be constructed; engines can be purchased (unlocking a third pawn); and the surveyor plows ahead checking out the route.  Players can also claim contracts, which grant an one time bonus, but also earn a lot of victory points at the end of the game if they can be fulfilled, through achievements made during the game.  Tight, fast paced game, with several clever ideas - the main one being the event cube system to keep the game moving by building ahead to prevent the players stone-walling.  

A curious design, that reads complex but plays simple, and seems to be well thought out.  I liked it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A nice worker placement with a lot of potential replay value due to the weather mechanic as well as the forced-progression track (pulling a white cube makes the game take actions that the players would normally make, pushing the game towards game end).
Some of the consequences of your actions might not be completely clear the first game but things get clearer fast enough.
Very good and looking forward to playing again.

RATING: 5
Almost the very definition of middle of the road.   The overnment action track gives the game some swingy unpredictability that can be frustrating.   The theme actually comes through quite strong in the game, and I admire it for that, but the mechanisms couldn't be more bland.   Lots of rehash.   Gather resources, convert them, then play them to card locations for points.  The game board itself is way, way too big and has a ton of dead space, which makes the table sprawl a bit of an annoyance.   It just looks and feels very unpolished sloppy.

I rather strongly dislike the way that a rush of white cubes can make the game go from halfway over to completely over with almost no time to respond.  Am I playing this game, or is it playing me?  I find it hard to believe that people would consider that "fun", but the game is highly rated by all of my geekbuddies, so what do I know.  Maybe there is a pinch of designer fanboy-ism skewing the analysis.

I want to like it more than I do, and I feel it could be a lot better than it is.

Aztán van 3 féle kártya (már a nyelvfüggő 30 szerződéskártyán kívül).
Ezek : az állomások és a vágányok: ezekből építjük fel a tábla hiányzó részét: azaz a megépítendő szárnyvonal kijelölt útvonalát.
Az állomások helye fix, a közé kerülő vágánylapok száma is(jelölve az állomásokon), de a vágányok minden játékban másképp kerülnek majd le.
Illetve az állomásból is 2 féle van: 2 játék típushoz.

A great worker placement with tough decisions, multiple paths to VPs, a bit of player screwage, fairly thematic. Definite improvement in strategic choices after 3 plays, the goal cards are essential for victory. Great expansions that offer a bit of a change while keeping most of the game intact.

It's been a while since I've played this one, so my comments will be a little sparse/hazy for this one. I remember there being an interesting racing element against the game and the other players. You race against the game from the automated digging along the track. Against players, you might be racing for a specific 'train card (?)' as well as for certain places along the track. Turn order becomes pretty important. Not only for the previously mentioned race aspects, but also because you may want specific resources which are seeded randomly. Some of the randomness of the game bothered me: somewhat with the resources available, somewhat with the weather, but mostly with the lack of control regarding knowledge of when event cubes are drawn from the game. It was a decent game and there is a lot of expansion and promo content which might make the game better. For me, I'd rather play a different euro.

RATING: 7
This was a surprise for how much I liked it, and I think the Snowdonia family will be a keeper in my collection for a medium-weight game offering. The base game offers a tight fight for resources and scoring opportunities that both dry up rather quickly due to an NPC entity that eats them up and serves as the endgame timer. 

That driving force caught us by surprise at first but now that we know how quickly the game can play, we've adjusted our playing style. Hey, I bought the game because I wanted something shorter than the usual longer fare I have, so I'm not complaining.

I've yet to try any of the multitudes of expansions, but from what I hear, they truly do change the feel of each game which is a pretty admirable dimension since they're mostly just a few cards for a few bucks.

Nice theme and I like the action selection track.

I am confused by the construction rules...as we learned the game, we were allowed to build station components including rail at the end of the game track while ignoring the connecting track or previous stations? That seemed anti- theme. (I work in mass transit construction, laying rail contiguously is important) 

After another play, despite my earlier comment, the game is fun and plays well, the effects and actions allow for multiple strategies. The kicker points from the contracts are where the winner triumphs, so tying each action to the bonus is key...if you take cards you can't score, you're doing it wrong.

My 11 year old daughter took to this one straight away and then trashed the four adults she was playing against.

Only two plays so far but both have been enjoyable and we are looking forward to trying again.  It's a shame the graphics aren't a little more colourful.

Update: Ok, three plays in the first few days and this one is really growing on me.  I love the simplicity of the design.  The events which cause the game to complete itself without player interaction is brilliant.  Link this to the ratio of event (white) cubes to resources and resource hogging becomes a difficult strategy.

A light-medium worker placement game with a coule of cool ideas. Firstly, weather forecasts that I've only ever seen in K2 previously. These keep each game varied and interesting, affect the game quite dramatically and need to be planned for.

Secondly is the white cube events that effectively move the game along and regulate the game length. This has been a great feature for my solo games as it makes it feel more like you are playing a game rather than solving a puzzle, which is how I feel about most solo variants.

I think this game is great and I really like the theme, particualrly the weatehr and constant fog. It feels very "Snowdon" as you slog up the mountain.

Snowdonia is a very traditional worker placement game: Place workers, collect resources, use resources to build stuff, score points. Nothing to see here. The game still manages to keep things interesting by adding a few twists and tying everything together with an unusual theme. The random events advance the game in a lurching manner that stresses the importance of tempo management and at the same time keeps a firm lid on the play time.

Eine lebendige Erinnerung als Brettspiel, das Bimmelbahn, Geröll und Wetter passend umsetzt. SNOWDONIA hat einen eigenwilligen Rhythmus, nimmt Fahrt auf, bremst ab, nimmt wieder Fahrt auf. Da muss man loslassen, sich den Wetterverhältnissen und den weißen Ereignisklötzchen beugen, die einem den Plan im Kopf verhunzen können. Kein Spiel für Kontrollfreaks. Swansea City Football Club.

My '8' rating is preliminary, after 5 plays. It could rise to a '9'. I do not think it will go down. Am not sure how often it will get played as some in our group don't care for it (though they are coming around a bit, the more they play). Evidently I MISSED ONE RULE for all 5 games! When a player excavates, he removes cubes equal to the excavation table. When the GAME excavates due to a white Event Cube, it removes entire SPACES as per the excavation table! Now, I have to play this again. Should make the game MUCH faster.  

Now rate the game a "9." Love having the expansions - have played through them solitaire, but not yet with the group.

I've wanted to try Snowdonia since it came out a few years ago. Worker Placement for sure and maybe not enough options to really make me feel like it can keep up with some of my other favourite WP games, but there are a few unique things going on in Snowdonia that make it an appreciable game. Plus, I always love a game that manages to integrate weather into it! Sometimes the mechanics are a little too abstracted from its theme, but there's nothing in it that feels overly wrought or clunky. Enough opportunities for tension as well and things are compact enough that other players will get on your nerves as they steal your moves and you have to alter your plans. Overall- good! Quite good.

It is an awesome game design with a lot of depth, and not too complicated to learn and teach! You've got a lot of decisions to make in this game as you build railroad tracks to the peak of Snowdonia, get contracts, clear the rubble, build stations, send out surveyors, pull workers from the pub, and buy one of a variety of trains (with different abilities) to help you along. The dynamic weather and events keep things hopping every turn. You get victory points for building track, building parts of stations, sending out surveyors, and fulfilling contracts. Getting there is quite fun! 

The game has a built in solo variant that is quite fun (and also helps to learn the game). You can play a series of 7 games (using each of the 7 trains). Since every train has a slightly different ability, it makes a slight difference how each game is played.

RATING: 4.5
I love worker placement but I have nothing positive to say about this game: the art is blah and the game is blah. It's not broken or terrible it just does not come together mechanically and it's not fun.  First, to end the game you have to build the rail cards, but since you can get twice as many points in other places for the same resources, no one wants to do that.  So, really the game can go on forever. Secondly, the resources are drawn out of a bag, so there's a really restricted market that doesn't help, enrich or add interest to the game.  Third, there are really vicious events that occur that can wipe you out.  I lost because the game destroyed the train I had built.  The only way I could have stopped it was with a card that hadn't yet come out.  Fourth, there are limited actions each round so you will get blocked every round or every other round.    Add this all together and it's like this game is still in prototype.  Individually, these things are pretty minor (except maybe the end game issue) but put it all together and there's no part of this game which is fun.  It's a long slog up a hill.  Skip this game.

What a weird game.  I was expecting it to be more of a train game, but it's not at all like that.  It's a worker placement with a train theme, with resource management and a bit of a race to score points.  I imagine the solo game is entirely different than playing it with other people.

Played three times now solo.  I think multi-player would be better, but the solo game is very interesting.  The first two trains play very differently and require much different approaches.

The dry theme and unusual card setup around the board do not keep this game from being engaging and tense.  Nothing really new here but it all feels really fresh, unique, and well developed. Theme is integrated nicely and really grows on you.  Event cubes keep game from dragging.  Great addition and better than expected!

Kickstarted. Worker placement, meet mountain, mountain, meet worker placement. Snowdonia plays quickly, isn't super heavy, bit it has more than enough going on to keep it interesting. I like the variety of set-ups and the weather idea is very clever. Lots of different ways you go, and the events can really mess with you, or help you if you time it right and you get the right cube draw. Sadly, the fancy KS plastic figures are not fancy in the least. I'd much prefer wooden pawns. Great solo!

RATING: 8.5
As I play more and more games, I'm starting to feel certain designs just shine through. I like worker placement games, I like when I feel like I can pick a strategy from an early onset and see how it pans out, engine building, and I like the tension from a tight game board, where sometimes the things you need someone else has denied you!
This game was very cleverly designed, lots of little engines cycling throughout the game. You have to pay attention to timing, turn order, weather, and even an AI.
And yet it's easily accessible to casual gamers! The iconography makes a lot of sense.

Theme is so-so. It works, but there are probably a lot of other themes that could have been pasted on in a similar fashion. 

Very impressed by this game. Kudos to the designer. Kind of an underrated gem if you ask me.

Interesting game with some nice random elements that provide enough variety to make each game unique. Weather is a nice thematic mechanic that can scumper your long term plans. White cubes and the track provide a good phantom player hurry up mechanic. Really hate the surveyor action though, It is the least 'fun' way to get victory points of any game I have played. Plays in the same wheel house as Agricola, without it feeling the same

Look forward to exploring this game and hope it holds up to my expectations. After a few solo game (really enjoyed) and 1 3 player I have this down as either a 9 or a 10 rating. Need to play with Sam / a few more time and see how this ends up. Really good game with a nice feel and lots of variety in how the game pans out (weather/white cubes). 
Rated as an 8 after playing with Sam as working out final scoring/which contract is better to for fill took away any cleverness the game had earned during the game as to Mathee at this point for Sam which took the shine off the game alittle for her. Still a neat WP game though and fun to play but probably one for SG rather than at home

This is my new favorite game to teach people, and the theme of building a Welsh railway is cute. Snowdonia is like Caylus in terms of mechanics, but it is definitely less frustrating. Workers are placed on spaces, and the actions execute in a set order. So positioning and timing matter a lot. It is also really easy to teach, like Lord of Waterdeep. And, it takes maybe 90 minutes at most.

I don't know why it's rated this high... to me it's just another WP game that doesn't offer anything new. It's not a bad game, but there are much better WP games out there.

The weather mechanic may be a nice touch, but it gets annoying when you have a fog 3 times in a row (for example), as noone is going to do much then.

Good thing is, it plays fast.

Euro de col·locació de treballadors i gestió de recursos. L'objectiu és construir una via de tren conjuntament amb els altres jugadors i el "poble", que fa de IA i de temporitzador de la partida, que és el més "diferent" (a més de que es pot jugar en solitari, que és poc habitual en els jocs de col·locació de treballadors). El millor del joc sens dubte son les cartes de contractes, que fan variar la teva estrategia, i la quantitat de mini-expasions diferents que hi han, que canvien regles per no ferse repetitiu. Penalitza l'acumulació de recursos per part dels jugadors, ja que accelera la partida (la proporció de cubs d'events que hi han a la bossa augmenta).

El reduit nombre de d'accions disponibles i de treballadors fa que no tingui gaire rejugabilitat, a més que les cartes s'ordenen igual, tot i que hi han moltes mini-expansions. E, dona la sensació de que pot ser molt repetitiu. Hi han algunes mecàniques una mica forçades, com el tema de les cartes de tren.

This one has really grown on me. Perfectly weighted to create meaningful decisions without generating analysis paralysis (as one friend put it, the "eurogame brain-burniness is kept to a nice low simmer" in this one). That's not to say I don't like heavy euros (I certainly do!) but this one gets a lot of table time because it's just so easy to get into; a very pleasant and enjoyable game all around. 

It's also mechanically brilliant, with the scores often close, and excellent variability between games due to some clever mechanics (an unpredictable 'government' player, and randomised weather).

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.75
Snowdonia is a mid-weight worker placement Euro, with a terrific, bur different Train-related theme: building the railway to the top of Mount Snowdon (Wyddfa).

Players have very limited actions, which can be increased by one per turn with both an Engine and Coal resources (which resource is also very limited).

This puts players in the position of having to decide whether to use valuable extra actions this turn, or save them, whether to position oneself to pick up coal (maybe), or take 1st player for next round.

Of course, critical bonus cards are also cycling through the play area, so players need their actions to take these.  

Or to grab resources needed for rails, or stations- or to refine them into steel.

Cleverly, the work accomplished clearing rubble, building rail, or building stations also play into the bonuses- not enough resources?  Too bad, that terrific bonus card didn't earn you any points.

Add to that moving one's Surveyor adds a gradual and increasing bonus for any players (and this can be increased with the right bonus card!) and players have quite a range of choices to select from.

All this adds up to a nicely calculated game, with a deal of control, some luck, nice theme, and great entertainment value.

It doesn't feel as nasty as Agricola can, but the decisions can be just as hard, and the game-end point talley up on a similar looking pad.

I started this at 7.25, but I am bumping this class effort from Tony Boydell up to a 7.5.

Snowdonia is a great euro, in a mid-sized box, and I look forward to playing it more.

RATING: 8.5
Worker placement game, plays up to 5 quite well.

A bit overwhelming the first time you play, but not really because the rules are complicated---it's because there are a variety of ways to score points and the game is so balanced that all of them are valid ways to go about playing.

Each round you have two workers you can place for actions. Later on if you acquire an engine, you can pay a coal to hire your third worker, but you only get him for that one round--you have to keep paying coal to use the third worker each round. So strange but it works.

There are also a TON of variants (most which are simply some additional/different cards) that slightly add/change up some of the details in the game. The rules are the same but you will definitely have to use a different strategy with these variants which make them worthwhile. So far my most favorite is one where goats are loitering around the tracks. When you build a track, your surveyor must be at on of the adjacent stations to that track in order to shoo the goat(s) away. It adds a simple timing to the surveyor (and the fact that you can't ignore him if you want to build track) and the goats can be used to help you fulfill contracts as an incentive to go after some goats. An example of a simple but interesting variant.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A fairly straightforward worker placer with the emphasis very much on action efficiency. It's pretty much essential to collect cubes on each turn as you need a constant supply of coal to get your additional worker, but you always want to do more than you can, which provides a little tension. The railway starts to build itself if the players are slow, so watch your timing, opportunities can disappear faster than the Welsh sunshine. The Ffestiniog Railway variant is much quicker to play, you may prefer it as there's less time to pick up lucrative contract cards. Worker placement has really been done to death by designers recently and this is well behind the classics, but interesting if you feel like something lighter.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is really clever.  It cranks up the time pressure with a clock that moves quite slowly at the beginning but begins to speed up as your options increase.  I like how rubble works; it's both a resource and an obstacle. And there's quite a bit of worry about setting someone else up, but even if you do, you are always helping yourself, and there's always something useful to do.  Would like to play more. (1 play)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Mechanically balanced on a razor's edge.

The event track pivots the tactical situation with each occurrence, pushing the game along, ensuring play never gets bogged down. The weather and contract cards open up different strategies during every game.

Solo play is amazingly engaging compared to most. Versatile set of minimalist expansions can simply and effectively change the strategic nature of the game for even more variety.

Snowdonia, you may hide you're sexy, but you will always be among my goto games!

An interesting, fun game, but after all the praise the game has received, I couldn't help but feel a little disappointed after my first game: It's a pretty generic worker placement eurogame, and since it feels like there is little escalation throughout the game, it starts to feel a little repetitive (get cubes, buy/build stuff, get more cubes, etc.)

Still, I can't deny that there was a lot to think about, and since I am sitting here now thinking of possible alternative strategies, I suspect the game might rise in my favour with more plays. Time will tell...

Lots of details to keep track of in this semi-abstract railway building game, but it felt almost like it played itself.  Check weather, then find the most beneficial actions.  The only variable is when to grab someone from the 'Pub'.

Will be getting my copy sometime next week. Looking forward to this worker placement game :)

+ Awesome game! The game is very easy to learn - as all the mechanics make sense. Owning your own little train gives you unique ability that is set apart from others. The weather and event triggers are fantastic, and add so much variability in each game. The theme might be boring to some people as it is not an epic space conquest or anything like that but people should know what the game is about before getting into this game so that is a non-issue. To me, this is such a relaxing, light worker placement game that I can enjoy for years down the road. Fantastic. Giving this one two coal dust covered laborers up.

RATING: 9
Excellent game! 

The way the worker placement is handled is unique and really makes you consider not only what action to choose but also which of the numbered spots within that action space to choose.  Sometimes, you really want to excavate 2nd, but what if an opponent excavates first with a contract card that lets them do so at double the work rate?  Do I really need that coal from the stockyard, or do I need to be first player next turn?  The choices here are just lovely!

The theme is very charming I think.  I am sure some will find it dry, but I personally prefer a little more mundane theme most of the time (instead of fantasy/space themes for example).  I think the game mechanics and the theme work very well together, and I love that I constantly have to drag one of my workers out of the pub.

The weather and the event cube mechanics provide a great deal of variety.  I have played games where we had fog for several rounds in a row, and I have played games where the weather was sunny and the event cubes were rarely drawn.  In this regard (much like reality), the game is a bit unpredictable, and so you will need to adapt your long term plans according to the draw of weather and events.  The Blaenau Ffestiniog game (on the backs of the standard station cards) provides even more variety within the base game, not to mention the various expansions available (which I plan to get soon).

I have played with 2 and 4 players, and it worked equally well with both player counts in my opinion.  Higher player counts will make the game run a bit longer, but not too much since the extra workers will cause the track to be laid a bit faster (i.e., a couple of pieces of track per round instead of just 1 per round in 2 player games). I have not tried the game with other player counts yet, but I expect it works well with 3 and might be just a bit worse with 5.

I also love the weight of this game as its not so complicated to teach but still has plenty of depth for experienced players.

RATING: 7
Snowdonia is a solid design and has mechanics that creates variability, mostly in the form of pacing changes, from game to game. My dilemma is whether other core mechanics and the theme are different enough to give it a permanent home in my collection. I am still undecided. 

In Snowdonia, players are clearing rubble and building a train track to the top of the mountain. But for that, it doesn't feel like a train game at all. It is a building and resource conversion worker-placement game. Players collect resources, clear rubble (which also becomes a resource), convert resources, and either build things for points (tracks or parts of stations) or collect things to get points for openly-displayed goal cards at the end of the game. 

There are a few design elements that are a bit different from the norm. First, the rubble is cleared and track is built in a linear structure that opens stations (building sites) as you go along. The later builds are worth 2 or 3 times more than the earlier builds. Also, there is an event track that can automatically clear rubble and build track to the benefit of no one. Events happen when event cubes are drawn from the bag during resource replenishment. Given that this is random, it can make forward planning difficult as the rubble and tracks you have planned to work with might not be there. The game ends when that last tack is built, so the end game can come quickly or slowly depending on the event cube draw. Another nice design element is that the game can change significantly by changing the station cards. Expansions for the game come in the form of station decks that make for good variability with just a simple deck.

I really like these elements, but the basic worker choices and goal cards are fairly pedestrian, which has me feeling a bit ambivalent about the game overall. You only have two workers with the option to purchase a third each turn, so the decisions each turn almost feel like too few. I'll definitely play it a few more times and see how it grows on me.

Snowdonia and I started on the wrong foot. The first few turns only a few spots can be selected and if you end up on the wrong side of the turn order there's nothing else to do than picking up the crumbs the other players have left over. Luckily, the game improves once the first two or three scripted turns are over. For a worker placement game, the theme is surprisingly well implemented. Long-term strategy is present in the form of contract cards that yield up to half of the victory points when completed and add variety to the game. The focus nonetheless is on tactical optimization and efficiency. The lack of strategic depth doesn't matter too much as it's one of the few games in this genre that are comparably quick and play to an end before the actions get repetitive.

First game: In spite of not removing enough rubble for the event cubes (which made the game take MUCH longer) we all liked the interaction/competition for the actions. I know we got some other things wrong. We still have some questions about specific contract card uses but the game flows nicely.
It is important to project when and how many resources to use for scoring opportunities. 
Second game: Set up of the stations and track perplexed us at first. We love the game as it has many opportunities for scoring but it is important to focus on just a few. And don't overlook the contract bonuses.

I just wish we'd stop playing late at night because usually I'm raring to go for a second game as soon as we finish the first! Definitely worth the trade.

My first game was a learning game for all players, in a noisy, difficult environment. And I had just played the almighty Agricola the night before. So my initial impression of Snowdonia is probably a bit unfair to it. I felt like I was fighting the game rules in a bad way, instead of struggling to figure out the goals. Mostly, the events didn't feel quite right to me; the excavating and track-laying operate on a wholly different scale than the same actions, and the only reason for the events I could see was to keep players from sandbagging.

Another play might clear up a lot of my misgivings.

RATING: N/A
One play in and I'm not sure what I think.  

On the one hand, the rubble clearance (+ weather + events) creates interesting timing constraints for the points grabbing.  Two of those are outside player control. While the weather is at least predictable, in the first game, that mostly translated into seeing who would be best positioned for the opportunities, based on turn order (also largely out of player control).

On the other hand, it seemed like that game mostly was just a point grab.  Tracks and stations are just ways to buy points.  Surveying and rubble give fewer point for fewer actions.  Except for the aforementioned timing issues from rubble, the various point buys are independent of each other.  The trains and contracts provide some powers and bonus points, but do not appear to change this dynamic.

That said, I would be willing to play again to confirm or defy my first impressions.

Tony Boydell made this game with a timer build in.
Timers like a set number of rounds or if the draw deck runs out work.

Now this timer makes the player work to get the railroad build as quickly as possible and thwt means there is little room for stalling.

What sets the game apart is the weather mechanism. Good weather means that the game moves faster, bad weather the game slows down.
It fits the theme very well.

Great theme, nice mechanisms, but I just hate these games where you buy cards which brings the biggest swings what comes to VPs. Again, that makes impossible to see who is doing well and who isn't.

RATING: 7.4
I should not like this game. It has pretty basic (almost prototype-ish) graphic design. It also has a very basic worker placement mechanism (you have two workers, or three if you hire one in the beginning of each turn, place them to free action spaces, resolve actions) which almost feels outdated in the time when every designer tries to find new uses of WP, mixing different mechanisms in, stretching the boundaries.
But for some reason this one works fine. I guess I really like rail/station-building aspect of the game, also the competition that the locals (the game) provide in construction, also the predictable uncertainity provided by these locals and the K2-style weather forecast. In the end, the game feels like it has theme, also you can sense the story arc and feel as everything is progressing to the game end. Also, it's relatively short - it plays in 60 minutes or so. For this length, it's a surprisingly good game.

Played three times, 4p & 5p.  Finally played with all the correct rules, and it turns out this is quite a fine game.  Note that there are enough little fiddly rules that aren't really called out where you might think they should be in the rule book, which led to playing wrong the first two games.  Very reminiscent of Agricola.  I felt that there are a couple of tweaks the game could use (for example, at some point, it is entirely likely that one or two of the possible player actions will NEVER be useful, or that some of the resources that are restocked each turn are totally worthless, etc.).

Played it once (2p) at rating. This is an odd one. Dosen't seem that great, but halfway through my friend looked up at me and said, "this is relay fun, in a tranquil and relaxing kind of way".

Solid euro with fast play (1h is about right), engaging mechanics and decently integrated theme.  The randomness of clockwise play VS 1st player selection VS cube pull can certainly be somewhat of a annoyance but other than that, there's a lots of fun to be had and a lot of player agency, indirect interaction and strategy.  The short length make it highly playable and is a definite plus.

Interesting but potentially fragile game if players hoard cubes allowing events to occur frequently.  Contract cards are interesting as they give a one time bonus as well as giving potential bonus points if conditions can be met.  Build track, parts of stations, gather goods, etc.  Pacing of this game has been quite varied in my games and quite vicious with government builds at times.  

=======================

The blue stations variant really changes the tenor and flavor of the game.  Scouting becomes less valuable point wise, but necessary in order to build up stations.  Also, people will start from opposite ends of the mountain and eventually meet somewhere middlish.  Note that the two scouting contract cards are removed from the game and that events work very differently.  Not sure which game I prefer.

I was not sure about this one, as it seemed like yet another worker placement euro, but I was pleased to discover that it offered a little bit more. The linear nature of the "board" (actually, the line of cards off of the board) means that worker placement requires more thought and planning than just "I want this action so I take the first spot" (which, not realizing this, cost me a LOT of points). The weather thing is also kind of neat. The whole is a bit ho-hum, though, and it doesn't really stand out strong against the tide of other worker placement games. 

UPDATE: down to 4. I just don't enjoy this kind of thing much anymore, and it has a lot of elements that just straight up annoy me.

Only one play so far.  This is a pretty straightforward worker placement game about building train tracks up a mountain.  The biggest trick with this game is planning ahead and being efficient with your actions. I didn't fully understand this at the start of the game and ended up doing poorly.  Overall, I would play this again as it is unique in some aspects that make it worthwhile.   However, I don't like how everyone is racing for the same goals as often you will be blocked.  Going last on a few turns can REALLY suck as everyone will take the objectives you need.

I will admit that I have most of the expansions for Snowdonia and have, at the time of writing this, played a grand total of...one of them. It's shockingly bad form on my part really. The collectors bug hit hard with me on this one... Something about the theme struck a chord and that was it, I was off! 

I have however played the base game solo a number of times, and I like it very much. It's classic worker placement I guess, but the whole design conceit in the way the track is laid out around the board, the weather mechanism and so on seems new (to me at least) and just works so very well. It's also not bloated with crazy amounts of choice, but enough to provide agonising moments. I like the pacing too. It doesn't outstay its welcome. The pressure is on and the end game ramps up in speed dramatically which not only works as a game but also thematically makes sense; these guys must have felt a tremendous push to get the job finished after all. 

There are aspects of the game that are missing in the solo experience (consideration of your chosen action based on other players' active contracts, the train purchase event, ability to change trains and subsequent bonus, vying for spaces), but it's not enough that you feel like you're playing half a game. I look forward to the day I get to play with others. In the meantime, I really must start to delve into some of the expansions, or at the very least use a different train or two...

A few nitpicks: It's quite a table hog, it's a bit fiddly to set up, and I can't fit my hand in the bag...but really, these are all first world problems. The game itself is excellent!

Fun worker placement game.  Played it at BGG.Con 2012 and had a good time even though I got destroyed by the other player's victory points in the end.  I don't think I'd want to own this, but I wouldn't be against playing it again.

I didn't know if I would like it, but I do. It's a very clean game, and the actions you take make sense. I don't know if there is anything truly unique here. The weather is an interesting twist, but perhaps not as interesting as I wanted it to be. TBD.

Received Nov 20, 2012

Played twice at GLG Nov, 2012. Rules are pretty straightforward and the theme integrates well into the game actions.

My first game was a learning game out of the box and I taught 4 new players the game the following night with no problems so that says something about the ease with which you can pick it up.

It was the only game I played twice during the convention and turned into a must buy for me.

After 6 plays: It does start to feel a bit repetitive. The first few turns are very scripted and with a lot of rainy and/or foggy days early in the game, it moves very slowly since excavating rates are poor. 

I still like it but I'm finding myself looking to other games to scratch my worker placement itch.

Full Game Review available in game forum.

The theme is decent but not immersive, the setup is kind of time consuming, and the game initially is really daunting. However, once the game is set up and everyone understands the rules it is an incredibly well paced game that pretty much just makes sense. Snowdonia mechanically works among the best of the worker placement games I've played which has earned it a high rating in my book.

Very interesting take on the traintheme. Many different paths to victory. Nothing heavy, basis is worker placement, but one that I like. 45min. playtime is a joke, perhaps you'll make it when playing with 1 or 2. It even had me wrongfooted: initially I was not interested much in this title. A good game cannot be that short. 5 player game takes a wellspent 90 minutes.

As a worker placement fan, I love this. Reminds me of Magnum Sal in its "just one more action"-ness. The weather mechanims is simple but clever; however, it's the Event track that's the really inspired part of the game. Tony, you flippin' genius.

RATING: 9
I was very optimistic about this game and I'm happy that it has not yet been a disappointment.  It initially seems to be a pretty standard worker-placement game, but does a few unique things that I enjoy.  I like the weather effects -- several turns of crappy weather has made for some interesting games.  I also like the goal cards -- these are critical to winning the game but using a worker to get them feels like a sacrifice since there is almost always other good stuff to be done.  I love that with only two workers, choices are always tense -- great decision making.  I love the special abilities offered on the goal cards and that it's not an either/or decision -- I can use the ability and still fulfill the goal, or if I don't complete the goal I still got the ability so the cards always have value.  I like the randomization of the market each round and I really love how the white cubes allow the game to advance itself.  Although I haven't explored them yet, I also love that the game can be completely changed up even more than usual through the various expansion decks available, offering new stations, new objectives, and new trains.  Finally, I love that this game consistently plays in about 90 minutes.  Because the game is designed to progress itself, it will finish even if all players are making poor decisions.  Lots to like in this box.  I really want to keep getting this to the table, especially to start trying out the additional decks.

I don't remember enough from the game to make much of a comment on it. It felt like a fairly standard worker placement game even though it makes an attempt at being different. Only being restricted to two workers a turn with the option for more temporary workers is sort of interesting, but it didn't seem to have a big effect in our game. I imagine it's a better game with fewer than five players.

[microbadge=1714]

[u]23-Jan-2014[/u]: This has quickly become one of my favorite Eurogames out there.  It's a non-train game train game.  What I mean is that there is a train theme to it, but you are not building routes and delivering goods.  Instead, through a very smooth playing worker placement mechanism, you gather resources to excavate rubble, lay track, and build stations on the way up one of the mountains in the Snowdonia area of Wales.

Players choose actions with their two or three workers each round, manage their resources, and maybe even use the help of one of the seven available Engines (each one with a special ability to help you achieve your goals).  The game just works very nicely together.  Every aspect seems well balanced.  There is logic to the actions required and planning ahead will definitely help your cause.

Plus!  The solo game is great fun.  It's a point attack style solitaire game, but again, it takes planning, timing, and good decision making to do well.  With some randomness during setup and multiple scenarios available (two in the base game plus more via expansions), there should be plenty of game to explore with this one.

Highly recommended all around.

[u]13-Nov-2016[/u]:  Still loving this game.  Currently, it's in my Top 5 and my #1 Euro.  Everything about it is fantastic for that genre of gaming:  smooth gameplay, easy to grasp rules, long term planning.  It epitomizes everything that a great Eurogame should.

When you consider the multitude of scenarios and options that are available for this game now, you come to realize that this isn't just a great game, it's a great game [i]system[/i].  The variety and replay factors are through the roof, IMO.  The high score nature of the game won't be for everyone, but it works for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Strategy game with recycled mechanics many will be comfortable with, used in some unique combinations. More so than many engine-building/worker placement type games this one forces players to be considerably tactical as opportunities can come on your turn and quickly disappear. There's a built-in timing mechanism that speeds up the game when players don't build fast enough. Weather will also speed up or slow down building. It's something I really like but at the same time it can be frustrating as you see your opponents luck into some meaty opportunities.

The train theme is really cool and I like the card-based board that turns mountains and stations into train tracks as they're built. Perhaps the turn-events could have been more dynamic. You know, for example, every game that there's an event that will kill your locomotive if you can't pay for it and that it only comes once. Looking forward to future games from this designer.

Really terrific medium weight worker placement game. It has so many elements of the other Lookout games that I like (charming theme/art, interesting resource management, and a solo variant) but it has an easier learning curve and isn't as punishing as Agricola or Le Havre can be for new players.

Player count and "weather" can really change the feel of each game and I can't see growing tired of this one anytime soon.

Really nice worker placement game. Has some interesting timing with the actions, and there's definitely competition over the actions on the board yet you're never left feeling like you have nothing to do. It handles the extra workers issue many WP games have by giving each player ONE possible extra worker, and that worker has an upkeep.

The weather mechanism is cool, and I like the AI company that comes in to claim jobs and keep the game moving. This one is really more than the sum of its parts. It scales pretty well too.

Whatever. Another spreadsheet game that forces you to make some tactical decisions for an hour or so before adding up all the points to see who has the most efficient brain. There's worker placement, resource conversion, some universal effects stuff, and a crapton ways to get points. You can pick a loose "strategy" with your train and contracts. The game seems to reward those who zig when others zag, as long as the weather and contract draws don't crush your plans. I suppose I'd play again, but I can't say I found this particularly compelling.

Awful game experience, too long and boring. I can see some god mechanics and clever ideas that just are obscured by the "rubble" aspect of the game - so bad, that the game itself removes it automatically (randomly) of play...

Snowdonia is a stronger game than I had anticipated.  Its theme does not really feel tacked on at all to me, as is repeatedly stated in reviews.  I find the train theme to work very well with the worker placement/resource picking mechanics.  People write: "Another damned WP game..." Yet they have taken the time to buy, set up and play said WP game.  I don't see attacking the mechanics as particularly compelling.  It's well-done, and more important, it's fun.  Set up and upkeep between turns can be a pain, a la Agricola, Le Havre, etc., but that is to be expected.  It could have been even better by adding a bit more interaction/coop I think.  The weather aspect of the game is wonderfully integrated. My wife and I have played this several times so far, and I think we will continue to break it out from time to time in the near future.

Players represent work gangs providing labor for the construction of the Snowdon Mountain Railway.

All this in competition with the weather of the Welsh mountains.

I thought I would love this game. It has a fun weather mechanism where you can only do certain things based on the weather and it controls how well you lay track and clear rubble, but overall, I just did not enjoy.

I guess as far as worker placement games go, I really want them to be deeper and heavier. Sonwdonia just seemed too simple despite being a fun game with a fun concept.

RATING: 9
Wow. 
A game where the narrative is such that all players “win” in the sense that the railroad is completed by game’s end, and each “team of workers” contributed. Some more than others. Those who contributed the most may be congratulated, and yet all had their share of labour.

My favourite worker placement game.

Some positive aspects:
-Continued variance (weather, bag draw, engines, contracts).
-Bag draw contains game length, so it stays fun right to the end and doesn’t suffer from dragging end game (as some worker placement games do drag on).
-Unusual player colours.
-Works well at all player counts.
-Intriguing solo play.
-Takes place in Wales.
-Is about trains.
-Designer is hilarious and active on forums.
-7 million (with more coming) expansions, of an eclectic nature.
-Rewards adaptive play.
-Not “multi player solitaire”, everyone is necessarily focused on main board, while perhaps moderately checking their own contracts.

This game is fantastic both as a solo experience and as an extremely tight multiplayer worker placement game with agonizing decisions. The addition of different scenarios in the forms of various expansions adding things like flowers, dynamite, snow and other things makes this game one that I long to play day in and day out.

Wonderful turn angst: Having only two workers is almost always too few, and the action spaces and building spots usually get snatched just before your turn. Lots of timing issues to consider with rubble and events as well. Runs smoothly, and the events make sure that the game moves forward all the time.

Plays very differently each time, depending on the weather, available scoring cards, and the order of track cards.

Grande sorpresa questo titolo passato un po' in sordina ad Essen 2012. L'ambientazione ferroviaria non deve far pensare a giochi quali 1830 o simili, ricorda di più i classici tedeschi anche se la pesca dei cubetti e delle carte obiettivo infarcisce il gioco di elementi fortuiti che comunque non tolgono al gioco profondità e spessore. Per arrivare alla vittoria sarà necessario pianificare la propria strategia, diverse sono le strade percorribili. Nel complesso lo trovo un ottimo titolo dalla durata accettabile.

Solid worker-placement, with a number of viable routes to victory, although inevitably it will come down to 'he who makes the best combo', a favourite conceit of the designer (usually because he knows the cards better than anyone else and CAN make the best combo). The 'game playing itself' mechanic is an excellent method to prevent hoarding. Outstanding with two; less so with five.

Difficult to find players in Melbourne, although I have taught as many as I can.
One of the best WP games I own - close to PotE or Terra Mystica, but does not hit the mark quite as well as Keyflower, Dom Species or Marco Polo. Not as approachable as Stone Age, either. Snowdonia has a dynamic random event mechanism which is *excellent* - it keeps players on their toes and drives the pace of the game beautifully. It also features a mechanism whereby in-game weather alters the pace, and a deck of end-game score cards that players can draft through the game. Taken together these three elements can bring a lot of randomness to the table. This doesn't suit everyone, so rated 8/10, but with players who enjoy uncertainty Snowdonia is one of the very best.

[b]Snowdonia[/b]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Updated thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]Snowdonia is a combination of two things I love in games - Worker placement + and divergent strategies from game to game (in Snowdonia this is driven by the variety of contract cards). I really enjoy the how the contracts and trains interact. You don't know which contracts will come up so you need to be able to adjust your strategy if you aren't seeing the contracts you need, there is also a lot of synergies between contracts and the available trains for each game. Similar to Agricola (another WP game I love), the contract cards force you to change your strategy game to game. The base game is amazing, but what is really astounding is how Tony was able to build a game that can then be modified in so many subtle ways through expansions to make this game infinitely repayable (similar again to how Uwe did the same thing with expansion decks for Agricola).[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]- I think this would make am excellent 2nd tier family weight WP game.
- The theme shines through; in both mechanisms and art/aesthetics.
- A lot of tension, especially due to the event track. You really can't wait too long to act or the man will come in and due it before you.
- The weather really helps the theme come through and forces you to plan ahead since every turn the efficiency of your actions can change.
- The variety of the contract cards really open up a variety of strategies to pursue, there is a lot of game in this box.

I didn't think I would get into solo games, but I've been playing a lot of Loyang. Not only do I think my family would enjoy this game (trains seem to be a hit in our house) I would also enjoy trying it out solo.

Includes the following expansion:

The theme is the gimmick here. It's a nice worker placement where the effectiveness of what the workers do each turn is determined by the incoming weather (random, but you get to see it coming). If it's foggy and rainy early, it'll be a longer game with not much excavating and track building done early so work out another way to earn VPs. If it's sunny, the opposite. You can claim contracts which will earn bonus points if you meet its criteria by end-game (excavate this much, lay this much track, etc) plus give a bonus action through the game, so they're more than useful. Otherwise you can claim points by excavating rubble, which then allows laying track, which eventually leads to claiming VP spots at the station along the way by giving up resources. As the spots for doing these things are limited, claiming turn order is useful, first in, best dressed. Making it very traditional worker placement in that sense, but the variability in how fast or slow things develop should make for some replay. And the theme is really nicely incorporated so, given it's a solid game, this will help drag me back.

Medium weight game about building the railway up Snowdon.  Uses worker placement mechanics.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Snowdonia is a fairly basic worker placement game.  You use your workers to collect various resources, possibly turn them into more advanced resources, and use those resources to claim spots worth victory points.  There are end-game bonus cards that you can also get to help focus your strategy, as well as train cards that you give you special abilities and an extra worker.  The game ends when the rail is built to the end, though because the game can come in and build stuff at random points in the game, it can end more suddenly than you expect.

Weight of the game is between Stone Age and Agricola. There is plenty to explore in this game and although we goofed up on a couple rules, the game went rather smoothly. Only having 2 workers a turn makes the game really challenging. I would love to try it with more players, but 2 played quite nicely. Great theme too.

Let me start by saying that the rating has still a hugue potential to increase. However my first play of this game was really dramatic (see logged play of 10/11/2012). But the mechanics are interesting. It's the kind of game where you have to set 1 or 2 goals and then stick by them and just go for it. It'snice to see that you can win without having a 3rd meeple.

There are some interesting things here. The game sort of plays against all the players, making them race for a very limited set of resource gathering and building opportunities. The graphic design isn't well thought out and many things in this game are hard to read. Ultimately my group didn't enjoy it, but a lot of that could have been because we didn't expect the game system to take away scoring opportunities so quickly.

Szóval ez nem egy rossz játék, de valami hiányzik belőle számomra. A játékmechanikákban nincs forradalmi, de jól összekovácsolt. Az első olyan játék ami a munkámhoz kapcsolódó, kvázi tematikus.:)
Sajnos nagyon rossz állapotban lett kipróbálva, így az értékelés sem lehet 100%-os.  
Többen jóval élvezhetőbb. 
Update: Most is állítom, hogy az egyik legtematikusabb euro. Nagyon-nagyon jó játéknak találom, de a szerződéskártyákkal kapcsolatosan "heves" vita alakult ki, amit nem oldott fel a szabály sehol, illetve a kiegyensúlyozatlanság is szóba jöhet velük kapcsolatban. De mivel én nyertem nem látom ezt problémának. :D

RATING: 9.5
Really excellent worker placement game.  It scores over other, slightly more pedestrian, games in several ways:  firstly, it is slightly cheaper, and secondly, it has the title "Snowdonia" printed on the cover in big, friendly letters.

Seriously, it's a fantastic game.  One of the best - if not THE best - of 2012.  It plays quickly - rarely as long as 90 minutes, more usually around the hour mark.  There is lots of variety in the game - with variable weather having a big effect on the game and the different contract cards which might or might not show up, plus the timing of the event track (which can see the game system building most of the track and stations if the players prevaricate too much), I've not had two games play out the same way.  But that variability does not add any complexity - the rules are straightforward and easily grasped.  And my copy had Ivor the Engine in the box.  Ivor the Engine!  It doesn't get much better (maybe Bagpuss in a game about collecting rare items, or the Clangers in a game about moon exploration, but I bet nobody has the bottle to deliver such delights).

Slightly torn on my opinion after three plays.

On the one hand, good bit to think about and there's a number of approaches to take to win (although Contract cards are vital). You really need to think out your turn - it's a brainy worker placement with good repeat value. I really liked the white event cubes too, which can make every game very different.

On the other hand, I found the contract card abilities annoying. You have to keep an eye on ALL unplayed cards before your move, as other player's contract cards can really affect your move. Slows the game down. Also, it's a killer to be last player (or next to last) at end game, which can happen very quickly, as you're often locked out of vital final track and station placements. Need to get evidence, but I'd say if you're last in the final turn, good chance is you'll be last in final scoring too.

Far more engaging as a competitive experience than a point-scoring solo game. This has come out more and more this year, and I've really fallen for its charms. A simple worker placement game and a slightly different focus for the train theme. Victory is all in the job cards. Don't neglect them.

Game starts out okay and you have things you can do but it just gets progressively worse and worse until you have nothing you can do.  The random weather card draw effect and events cubes draw effect can completely ruin one player's game.  I hate games where the game beats you up and causes you to lose a ton of points with no recourse or way to fix it.  Absolutely terrible, Agricola is the only thing worse.  Play Pay Dirt, it uses many similar mechanism with weather and events but it's a bazillion times better because the game itself doesn't just do half the work for you and ruin any enjoyment the game might have had.

I have only played this once, at the local club (not my copy - I had no interest in the game when I first read about it). The theme is dull as ditchwater, and the play fairly standard worker-placement fare, yet I did quite enjoy it and can see some potential in this game. In particular, while every worker placement game has a feeling of you not having enough actions to do everything you want to do, here that feeling was acute throughout the entire game. Many different point-scoring opportunities leading to many routes to victory, as you'd expect in any good Euro.

I didn't think the game was great or particularly original, so this is still only a 6 for now - but I can see the possibility of my rating rising after more plays. (I haven't yet played the game again, even though that first play was in 2012 - but I the owner does still sometimes take it to game nights, and I expect I will play it again at some point.)

Snowdonia is a worker-placement euro with a semi-cooperative twist. Players work together to construct the Mt. Snowdon railway, while facing some cleverly-incorporated changing weather mechanisms and in-game events that can make even their best-laid plans go astray. There is something quaint and attractive about this game, that I cannot quite put my finger on. Every play presents just the right amount of variety and only -just- whets my appetite for a race-like puzzle, that it keeps me coming back for more. Well done, Mr. Boydell. 

(+) Simple gameplay mechanisms and an, impressively, adaptable system. As evidenced by a rich series of expansions.
(+) Despite the simplicity of your turn structure, the cardplay and weather mechanisms adds some fun novelty to augment your turn structure.
(+) Unique theme that encourages some form of brinksmansip--give a little here, to get back a little there. Competition and interaction among players is higher than most worker placements and it pays to be alert to your opponents agenda in this euro, more than most. 

(-) The built-in cycling weather mechanisms can lead to some particularly uneventful turns.
(-) Likewise, the randomized draws of the in game events can certainly waylay some well-strategized plans.
(-) The graphic design, despite being clean, comes off as somewhat bland.

I will just say that I have only played this once but I was taught it by one of the playtesters, so i assume all was correct.

First off i will clarify that this kind of game isnt really my cup of tea, though i am happy to try all games in the hope of finding an unexpected gem. I do tend to judge games harshly in general and have found i dislike most games and would normally have given this kind of game a score of 4/5...

...BUT my biggest issue with the game is this: early on it was foggy so we couldnt do most of the actions, eventually the weather did clear and some work was done however it soon went foggy again and thus few actions were available - this was annoying enough, HOWEVER at this poing a LOT of white cubes were drawn and while we were unable to clear/lay/build it seems the mysterious fog fairies had no such problems, and seeing how the rail and rubble tracks were high when the fog came down the town did a LOT of the work so that there was little left to do for us when the fog lifted!

I fail to see the point in a game where the game actually does most of the playing and we just sit around and watch! Especially when it does so in such an un-thematic way.

RATING: 6
Worker placement game where two "outside" factors have an influence on the overall game.  The first is weather which can speed up or slow down the progress towards the game goal.  The other are the events which represent (in the abstract) non-player characters doing things faster than the players thereby removing development options from the players.  Unlike other engine building games, this one doesn't feel like it accelerates towards the end, but that said, the end can come rather suddenly if players aren't watching the action choices closely.  With only two (and perhaps a third from the pub) action choices, a game of trying to be efficient while generating points both building the track and stations up the mountain and then applying those same achievements to the more powerful contracts for additional points.  Plays rather quickly which is another plus as the game doesn't feel overly long.  In the first playings, also seemed to be multiple options for players to score points so end game scores aren't that far apart.

Played about 5 times with 4-5 people.  Pleasant theme is tied in well to the board design and game elements.

Didn't really enjoy this one - it felt like a more abstract version of Brass (which already is pretty abstract, but I would prefer to play and invest time in learning strategy).  This game made me realize I much prefer worker placement games where you get the stuff when you place the worker (a la Agricola or Lords of Waterdeep) as opposed to Snowdonia and others where all the players place all their workers and then you go in order getting the stuff - the latter just slows the game down a lot and increases AP.

RATING: 7
It's a nice theme - building a railway up a mountain. It feels more like strolling up the mountain than toiling sweat and blood. (A spare worker is just hanging around the pub after all.) Along the way you clear rubble, lay track and build stations. Choose a locomotive to assist you in your endeavours - they all do the job, or rather "a job" with different special abilities. Which is the best? Well that will depend upon your plans and what the other players are eyeing off.

It's a nice ride. (That pub seems popular.) Not a great deal of tension though because everything is relatively easy to acquire. If you don't source whatever this round there's always the next and probably something just as good from the available contracts, right? Right? Well, maybe. That said, the contract competition is where the game is ultimately won or lost and just falling short of your rubble acquiring, track laying, station building aims can make a brutal difference to your score. So toying with your opponents goals will raise the tension considerably. It's up to the players really.

It's a very decent worker placement game that I'll be happy to explore anytime. Simple rules and a nice theme, the game also has expansions popping out every which way, which should make me keen to keep exploring, clearing, building and fulfilling those tricky to achieve contracts.

Decisions are not too taxing so not much AP to worry about.

Cards are important as VP's can be accrued in bigger quantities from cards than the actual laying of track and buildings.

Definitely like it!

Highly interactive between players because you're building the same railway -- it's such a perfect idea for worker placement. The same event system adds a dimension to multiplayer while driving solitaire play. Speaking of which, managing resources in the same bag as event cubes are drawn, makes this one of the more exciting 1+ player games on my shelf. Finally, it's more of a gaming system than a single game, due to its ease of expansion. And there sure are a lot of expansions.

Just wonderful.

There are some interesting ideas in this worker placement game, and workers feel a lot more precious than in most worker placement games, but there is not enough variability for me in the contracts and the trains. While the contracts give special abilities, they are one time use, and not particularly interesting.

Very solidly-designed, quaint, medium weight game that plays quickly with little down-time although setup is long. But after several plays, the theme fades into the background and it feels like you're mostly playing through the mechanics only.

Very good worker placement game. Great theme, which it models nicely - I especially liked the weather effects. The game plays at a good pace with very little downtime (although the AP prone can drag ANY game down!). Only one play so far but suitably impressed. If I'm held to the fire to highlight any downsides I might mention that the set-up is not a trivial task, but the play makes that all worthwhile. Recommended.

This is one that had caught my attention at a recent gaming session and I was looking forward to trying it.  I'm quite glad that I did as it has some very cool elements to it.  The contract system works well as does the random weather element.  There are just a lot of well done things - the shutting down of locations, the government building things that prevent you from building.  A very solid 8 to start, with plenty of room to go up for me.  Looking forward to playing this again!

This is definitely a 9 for me and I really enjoy my plays of it.  At first glance you might even think it's a Wallace game.  Love the weather mechanic more and more as it lends lots of variety.  Also, the way a turn plays out is almost always interesting.  It's a definite top 10 contender for me.  Great stuff!

RATING: 6.5
Like the other games I have rated at 6.5, the general mechanics of the game are great. In this case a nice and tight worker placement with multiple paths toward the end of the game. 

However, the VP system is just too random. If you can succeed at either getting a good VP objective card early and try to build for it, or build towards one you know is available and it comes out, then you will likely seal the win. The VP boosts are too large to ignore and definitely enough to push you ahead of the pack. Unfortunately, the VP option you need may never come out, might be stolen by other players, or you may just not get the opportunity to take it. On the flip side, someone might just happen to luck into the perfect VP card coming out right when they have first choice and be able to net some massive VPs completely uncontested. 

To make this game even more punishing there are mechanics built in to allow the game to smite you itself, completely blocking the actions you need to take to complete your goals or automatically building the spots you have been planning on completing; and the timing of all of that being based on randomly drawing certain cubes from a bag.

Our family really enjoy Snowdonia. The gameplay is complex enough to make us keep coming back for more, yet not too complicated that it takes a dozen goes to work out what is going on! 

Love the way the weather throws a spanner (or even a shovel) in the works periodically, and the fact that you really do not always need to buy a train to win the game.

Snowdonia is destined to become an all-time favourite in our house.

Played once with 4P and once with 5P. Snowdonia is a rather tricky game to assess. With worker placement as its core mechanism, it offers several tweaks that set it apart from other games in the same genre – there is a game of chicken in clearing out rubble, a rogue AI player and weather conditions which require players to constantly adjust their plans. 

But after the dust has settled, I feel that Snowdonia is just another paint-by-numbers worker placement game. One nitpick I have is that players have to constantly pay attention to the bonuses of their opponents' work contracts, which is not an easy task when playing with a full player count. 

The bottom line is, Snowdonia is a solid design with no apparent flaws. It even plays fairly quickly too. There is no doubt that this game will have its fans, but to me it's merely just a serviceable addition to an overcrowded genre.

Another FANTASTIC game. I'd call it a medium-light worker placement. It's nothing overly new, but I really like the look, feel, and overall design of the game. It's very thematic, the weather mechanism is nifty, and the game can't go too long since it's also playing itself to keep everything moving. You can't dilly dally around while playing due to the Event mechanism. Very neat. Wow, now that I'm talking about the game and all it's neat stuff, I think I probably originally discounted here a bit too much. What's also cool about the game is that there is an alternate version of the game included in the box what works a bit differently. I haven't tried it yet, but it's on my to do list. I like that the front and BACK of every card is somehow used in the game. There are definitely no component inefficiencies. As a bonus, the game can be played solo and the solo play work REALLY well. 

SOLO PLAY:  Snowdonia is a fantastic worker placement game that's thematic and FUN! There are multiple strategies that can be used to win, but overall the game is fairly straightforward. These attributes make the game ideal for both experienced games and new gamers alike. The artwork is quite good and fits the overall feel of the game nicely. There is also a pile of 310 wooden bits in lots of colors and this is the first game in which every front and back of the cards is important and used in the game! There are so many great things to say about this game in general. From a solo play perspective, Snowdonia plays VERY well. The goal of playing solo is basically to improve your previous score, but you get to play with a different engine each time and the random setup of the track and the contract cards make the game experience different each time. All of the rules and mechanics are the same when playing solo. Since the game plays itself to some extent through the event mechanic, the game can progress quick quickly when playing solo, so a game can be knocked out in about 30 minutes once you understand the rules and flow of play.

I kind of like the game, though I have seen the game moving in so entirely different directions depending on the weather -- in one game all the dirt more or less disappears by itself, in the next we have such a hard time even getting to the first station that everyone goes for other victory paths instead and the track almost doesn't get finished, et cetera -- that it feels a bit like a beta version to me.

[BGCOLOR=#000000][COLOR=#FFFFFF]SoloX.[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] Worker Placement. Solid game. I like the multitude of ways to earn points: straight up placement/tasks, advancing a token for bonus points at game end, taking contracts for bonus points at game end. Not really that complicated for what you get out of it.

Unfortunately, I don't think I have room in my collection for another worker placement game. I don't think I'll ever get rid of Caylus (classic), Stone Age (fun, dice, possibly a gateway+ game), or Egizia (great mechanics). The me of even just a year ago would be all over this. The me of post-Great-Purge-of-'12 has to pass unless something changes in my collection. I'll happily play the heck out of someone else's copy, though.

Edit: the more I think about it, the more I decide I want to get this. Is there really such a thing as "too many worker placement games?"

Edit: played it again at BGGcon 2013 - we all still like it a lot. Definitely worth having.

Edit: finally played my copy of Russian Railroads. While different, I feel like RR is a great game in the heavy/long-ish worker placement category with lots of things going on, and bumps down the priority on Snowdonia.

Edit: Got it BGGcon MT, heh.

I like this game quite a bit. I love that you are limited to just the two actions (at least initially) and that the speed of the game is pretty variable depending upon how fast the players acquire (and consume) resources. I feel that there always is so much to do and not enough time to do it, and that tension hangs over almost every placement that you make. The theme is interesting, and I like the excavation aspect to it. This game seems to manage to rise a bit out of a crowded modern worker placement pack. I can see me moving this up to an 8 (or higher) with further plays.

This was a really cool game! I had thought it was a train game, which I love, but it's as much of a train game as Ticket to Ride! But it's a really good worker placement game! Maybe the best worker placement game? Let's see ...
- better theme (trains!) than Agricola, Caylus, etc.
- a good amount of randomness (not too little, like Caylus; not too much, like Carson City) in the order of track cards, pull of resources, play of events
- thoughtful decisions, but not overly painful/frustrating play (as in Agricola)
- nice play time, even on a first play
Yeah, it could be one of my favorite worker-placement type games at the moment!

RATING: 7
A reasonably simple worker-placement and resource management game with a really dry theme but some interesting mechanics.

In this game we are turn-of-the-century construction companies building a network of train tracks and stations up a mountain (why do so many board games have to have trains in them?!).  In order to build these tracks and stations players need to first excavate to clear rubble and there is a really neat weather system that changes the effectiveness of your actions (in sunny weather you can excavate and build more, in rain less, and in fog it is too dangerous to do any work).  I also like the work contracts that provide players with once-per-game abilities and endgame scoring goals.

The mechanics are reasonably simple and easy to teach to others.  There are 7 action spaces that amount to simply collecting resources and clearing rubble to build tracks and stations with those resources.  The mechanics and planning for things like the weather and completing your personal goals are what make it interesting and fun.  It is also a very modular system, the base game comes with an "advanced" mode that has players building from two different starting locations and they've already released more campaign decks that alter this system more.

My main issue with the game is the dry, uninteresting theme.  Building trains yet again.  This is boring and before they even see the box nobody wants to play yet another train themed Euro.  Then they see the box and they definitely don't want to play.  Muted gray watercolor art with a guy sitting on a pile of rocks covering his crotch.  Plus, from an actual gameplay standpoint the fact that it is pretty simple doesn't make me want to play it over any number of other worker-placement games available even with the couple of interesting mechanics it has going for it.  The modular system, though, might be its saving grace and I'm going to at least give it a shot with some of the "advanced" game modes and alternate campaigns before I pass final judgement.

Medium weight worker placement game where you are building a railroad up a mountain in Wales. There were no innovative mechanics and the theme of building trains/railroads has been done before. There is some randomness in the game (cube draws, weather), which can effect overall experience of the game depending on how they fall. I would play this again, but definitely wouldn't request  another play. 

Note: I know there are expansions, which I haven't played with so maybe that would make the game more interesting. I would be open to trying one of the expansions, but I would also be happy to play almost any other worker placement.

Snowdonia is a worker placement game. Sounds simple, and it is simple to play, but it really is new at something. The feeling of play it's somehow new although the mechanics are not. Players build track to get into the end of the line (top of the hill!) and this is made by removing rubble out of the way and building stations.

It's one of those cases in which players start something that others can complete and thus getting an advantage. And this often works as a dangerous mechanic although, in this case, it's built in a clever way and so, it doesn't hurt the game.

I played the game with 5 players and it didn't seem the best format but, either way, the concept and the execution were alright for me. Not brilliant or flawless but very well put together as a piece. 

I would recommend it to the occasional gamer but also to the hard core gamer that doesn't suffer too much on the theme over the concept. A game that occupies a certain niche in my collection, for sure.

First impressions based on one five player game.

A 'Theme first', worker placement and resource management game that pits players not only against each other but time's (swift or slow?) hand and the weather as they build a railway up to the top of Snowdonia.

At first site the things I like a lot about the game are the tightness of the actions and turn order - however what the game stand out is the tempo forced on the players - the game has a mechanic that builds the railway at the same time as they do, it adds tension and angst to decisions. Whilst the timing of the games progression up the mountain is semi-random, the players do have the benefit of a semi-perfect weather forecast. The weather (the system reminds me of K2) effects how efficient some actions are and might stop building all together. Both systems are an elegant way of avoiding a big build up and build at the end of the game. I like the fact you need to both work towards a strategy And take tactical points through out the game. Strategy partly comes from the contracts which appear each round which give end game bonuses - however the contracts also give one off and powerful bonuses which makes using an action to take a contract you might not be able to complete attractive. 
Another neat feature is that the resource management is not over complicated - where it differs from other games is that one of the actions to help build the railway also produces a low value resource (rubble) which can be converted or kept (if you have the right bonus/contract card). I have been losing interest in this genre in 2012 but this game hits the spot - multiple paths to victory, interplay variability (contracts, weather, events), theme and game length. Oh and there are trains in the game :)

This joins the recent spate of games like Trajan and Village where there are a LOT of different things a player can try to accomplish and no single player will ever do them all in a single game.  If there is a best line to take, it'll take a few games to identify it.  I'm told the game arc can be very different from playing to playing -- random events come out sooner or later, and players' choices also make things happen faster or slower.  I'm not sure there's anything in here that will make Snowdonia rise above the pack, but it's enjoyable to play.

Tells a narrative that is fairly rare in a "convert resource types" worker placement game. I'm not sure it is completely balanced (clearing rubble seems powerful). Still, there is a lot of interesting factors to the game that would make each game very unique. A bit too randomness for my taste, but it is still decent. Best part is how you have to adapt to what comes up and not focus on one thing too much without leaving yourself open to switch.

Not realy a rail network game, a pretty good worker placement game that fits the rainy track build up the side of Mount Snowdon.

RATING: 9
Innovative worker placement game with a railway building theme. The object is to use your workers to perform several different tasks, such as clearing rubble, laying track, collecting resources etc. This is an absorbing feature of the game as everything you do can benefit or hinder your opponents as the building of the railway is a collective effort. Victory points are earned in a number of different ways such as building sections of track, constructing parts of the stations and fulfilling certain contracts. As in all great games there a multiple paths to victory and the varying nature of the contracts in particular means that every game is going to be different. This is such a clever game with many innovative features to the gameplay, which all integrate with one another brilliantly, and designer Tony Boydell is to be applauded for introducing such a fresh game to an already highly populated genre.

I was fortunate enough to play a near final copy with the Designer and some of the playtesters. 

It's an excellent game with a well woven in theme, and is different to what could be called a 'typical' railway game (route connection, shareholding etc...) as it takes route building to the extreme - you are collectively building one railway line - just different parts of it throughout the game. 

There are some nice tightly coupled mechanics around worker placement, and the associated action order influence, and it forces the players to complement each other's actions to advance the building of the of the railway and stations whilst competing with each other to make sure they get the most points / benefits out of moving the overall game forwards. 

It deals very effectively with challenging the players to manage resources, and the scarcity of some of them in the game. The trains and cards used to give benefits and end game scoring means there are multiple paths to victory. I think it's also got lots of replayability, as alongside the different routes to succes, variable factors such as the weather means no 2 games should play the same. 

Its all wrapped up in a quick playing (1 - 1.5 hrs) game engine, with some great artwork, so I can't wait for it to arrive at Essen.

This worker placement game takes place in a post-apocolyptic steam-punk setting. You have a maximum of four workers during the game. Two you start with and you will have for the entire game. The third is a steampowered robot that requires coal to operate. If you have no coal then he hangs around in the pub until you can power him. 
All of these workers require supervision. If there is fog out that reduces visibility then they are unable to search for new track or upgrade any unearthed track.
The fourth is a sniper. The more stations the sniper hunts at the more points he scores at the end of the game. Unlike the others he can operate independantly, even during a fog, however he must search at every station on the route in sequential order.
All in all, Snowdonia offers a unique take on worker placement by providing a setting that is not common in European games.

A perfectly decent, light-medium-weight game that I enjoyed playing much more than I expected to.

The weather track does some interesting things, varying the desirability of certain actions and the 'outside contractors' who do your work for you is another interesting addition.

The cards which seemingly add replayability aren't really my thing and I dislike having to be aware of what cards people have, but I can live with those.

Fun worker placement boardgame themed around building a railroad across the Snowdonia mountain.

Although a competitive game it is friendly and pleasant to learn and play.

RATING: 9
I like the game in general. Here are the things I enjoyed most:

1. Contract cards.
It was fun figuring out ways to maximize end-game points with the contract cards. I found that to be one of the better aspects of the game, even though I misunderstood the rules, and made bad decisions because of it. I like that the contract cards not only gave you end-game goals to shoot for, but that they also give you a in-game bonus. And I imagine with further plays, I'll learn how/when to best use those in-game bonuses.

2. Events.
I really like the use of white cubes drawn from the resource bag to trigger events. Players can plan for events, but not when. Super fun, not to mention the way the events play a major role in the way the game plays out.

::UPDATE:: (After 11 plays.)

My rating--currently 8.5--will either stand, or go up (most likely peaking at a 9).

I like how the game feels, start to finish. I like the time frame. It fits perfectly with its depth. I also like the weather mechanic and how it works with "the competition" (as we call the dummy player). I like that additional workers aren't "born"; that is certainly a refreshing touch among WP games. 

I imagine it will raise to a 9 soon. The only thing that makes me hesitate is that in the 3+-player games I've played, there was usually a leader who was far out ahead of the pack. The only exception was my 5-player game where 2 of us were way ahead and the other 3 were way back. 

I don't mind a game that's somewhat unforgiving. But in a game that has so many random events happening, it's easier to blame the big wins on those elements, rather than the players. 

However, I've yet to play a 5p game with 5 experienced players. I imagine after a couple more plays, with the 5 of us being familiar with the whole game, we'll know if this is a consistent issue. My guess is it won't be, and it will only take one close game all-around to resolve the concern. 

Even still, a 9 is among the best in my rankings.

What a fun little game this is. To me this one feels like Stone Age "advanced" in the same vein as Thurn & Taxis is Ticket to Ride "advanced." Basically it's a simple worker placement game and in all honesty is a step back in the genre in that there's nothing beard strokingly clever about the mechanic. It's just what it is, place your guys then everyone activates. The game gets going once you have a few cards built and can take extra actions and such. The fact that the game comes along and finishes parts of the game ahead of the players is however quite interesting and new. Nothing too heavy here and nothing shockingly new but lots of fun. 

UPDATE: When I first got the game years ago I got it and had hoped that I would enjoy it. Over the years I keep playing it, and it always delivers an exciting and interesting game. The amount of little add-ons Tony has created for this game is astounding and you know...some of them are free that he put up on his blog. Others were cheap when they first got printed but have increased in price, as they are now oop and hard to get but that's how things go in this hobby. All in all this game started at a rating of 7, and slowly and steadily crept up and now I feel very comfortable with my rating of 10 for this wonderful, brilliant game.

The idea of competing to build a railway is really interesting the worker-placement mechanics are simple and straight forward. There’s lots of interesting and difficult decisions and many ways to get points. We immensely enjoyed it.

The production quality is fantastic—but I would have preferred the first edition with the wooden worker pawns instead of the plastic minis, it would have made for better hand feel.

Snowdonia is a game that I've had my eye on for a long time now. I had a vague idea that I'd like it, but couldn't quite tell you why. I also knew that at least one player in my group already didn't like it and a couple others probably wouldn't. So when I got a chance to play a copy, I was pretty excited.

The game is about building railroads in the mythical? real? village? city? country? of Snowdonia. To be honest, the theme wasn't the selling point for me on this one. There were trains, railroads, stations, coal and enough details to convince me it had something to do with trains, but I didn't really pay much attention to the theme past that. The players are all, well I'm not really sure... competing railroad companies I guess, trying to outrace one another to build more of the stuffs than anyone else.

You lay out cards around the board which represent the railroad track and stations that will be built over the course of the game. There are also cards representing all the actions players can take on a turn. There are limited spaces for the desirable spots and they execute in a certain order... so jockeying to take the action at the right time is huge.

The actions are take resources from the stockyard, shovel out some rubble, convert resources from the basic type to the advanced type, build railroad track, build trains/stations, take a scoring/power card and move your surveyor. There's also a way to get a temporary worker for the turn (if you have coal and already have a train).

The border cards come out with "rubble", brown cubes, on them that has to be cleared before anything else can be built in those spots. How much rubble you can clear in a dig action depends on the weather. Players can dig out rubble so that they can build railroad tracks (one type of card) and spots on stations (the other type of card). You have to dig out rubble in order and the player who clears the last rubble away from a station spot gets to claim that spot, and the associated VP, for themselves. Station spots without rubble require that you spend resources to build them (and require a build action instead of the shovel action).

There's a stockyard where iron, stone and scarce coal come out every turn and one of the actions is come swipe three of them (but you're limited to one coal).

You can convert 3 times turning three iron into a rail, or two rubble into a stone. Rails are used to build railroad tracks, trains and some station spots while stone only builds station spots.

Building railroad track lets you claim the next border railroad card which gives you the points shown on the card.

Building a railroad gives you some combination of coal, cool powers, points, and the ability to get temporary workers with coal.

Claiming a scoring/power card gives you a special ability you can use and a scoring goal to aim for.

Moving your surveyor gives you some points, but unless you're going to do it often it isn't worth it. It ramps up in points the more you do it.

The game ends when the last track to the last station has been built. There are some events that mostly speed the game along, but that depends on how often you pull the event cubes from the bag.

The game has a lot of interesting things going on. I think the heart of the game is getting the right scoring cards, working hard to accomplish those goals, and trying to time your actions correctly. Figure out what other people are trying to do, what's most important and what you have to do and in which order you have to do it. I had a lot of fun playing and look forward to playing again.

The interesting part about what at first glance looks like an average worker placement game is the addition of event cubes where the game plays itself. This means it's often a better strategy not to stock up on the ressources as that involves an increased risk of event cubes being drawn.

A light/middle-weight euro game with an interesting weather system. I'm unsure if this game is that good as a 2 player game, as it went for far too long. We drew 4 white cubes for the entire game which meant that everything was left up to the players. 

The mechanic of drawing cubes randomly from a bag, and if they're white, they speed the internal game clock is rather inelegant. It portrays a lack of understanding of mathematics; chalking up to the fact that situations like our game come up so rarely that it doesn't matter. To be more precise, by using such a mechanic, you lose control of how a game plays out. That's a serious flaw in my eyes.

I'd shudder to think what I would have thought if the game did nothing but spit out white cubes and the game essentially played itself.

Purchased used in like new condition.  Have only played once, but we were underwhelmed.  With 2P, the weather mechanic feels very, very punishing.  It pushes things along very quickly and leaves us with less options.  We think we would like this better with 3-4P, but haven't gotten a chance to try it.  It might get better at 2P in future plays, but other games keep finding their way to the table instead.

Do you enjoy shovelling rubble? Would you like to spend two hours shovelling rubble? Snowdonia has a cool theme to a Brit mountain walker, but I found the game 'meh'. I love worker placement games that 'ramp up' to a climax like Russian Railroads or Caverna. You get more workers. New placement options reveal themselves. The battle for resources gets tighter.

Snowdonia isn't one of those games. You're doing the same thing throughout - get resources, clear rubble, convert rubble to something better, convert resources into track, get your spare worker out the pub, build a building for the same point value as the other buildings, lay track, pick up a contract, stop due to fog, restart work. On... and... on... and on... 

I ended the game feeling as though I'd just dug a tourist railway up Snowdon in chucking rain and thick fog... with a teaspoon.

This isn't a game that's easily intuited by parts alone, but once the game is explained and underway, everything makes sense.  There are a lot of moving parts, but they come together into a simplified, streamlined kind of game.  I like that it has different scenarios, most of which can be implemented simply by trading out decks of cards or shifting the abilities of the different spaces.  I like it, and I look forward to playing it more.

Classic worker placement (not a train game at all), which offers a bit more theme and gravitas, but also is a bit finicky (lots of bit and pieces for setup). Overall, a bit dry perhaps. A notable, pleasant deviation from standard w.p. is that spots can be shared between players.

RATING: 8
Snowdonia is a much easier game than it lets on. The cards are chock full of helpful information, point scoring opportunities and rule breaking special powers, none of which are hard to understand, but packing them all onto each card really makes it all very intimidating. That being said, once you get over the initial confusion, the game flows like a dream.

In many ways, this feels like a crunchier version of Tokaido. The game is structured around being opportunistic around other players actions and timing your moves to leave as little free stuff for them as possible. Unlike Takaido, there are a ton of things to think about. There is a variable weather system, some resource gathering, and even an AI event system that pushes anyone that's being too methodical out of the way, taking their opportunities and leaving them scraps as a reward for their caution.

There is also about half a dozen tweaks and scenarios you can play around with if you pick up a few expansion decks, so it will be quite a long time before you see everything Snowdonia has to offer, unlike Takaido, which shows you everything half way through your first game.

Looks gd, gd quality, love the workers. Love the idea of the theme, which does not shine through but like the weather and getting workers out of the pub.

A well put together but somewhat ordinary worker placement game.  It is neither as chaotic nor as innovative as some comments seem to suggest.  However, the mechanics can stagnate the game, as the weather can bring gameplay to a halt and slow pulls of event cubes can cause the game to drag.

Snowdonia looks like a pretty average worker placement game, but then you start playing it. Well, more appropriately, the game starts playing you: if you sit back and build your resources, the game is going to start cueing events and those events will clear rail lines, build stations, and build rails if you don't get to them soon enough. Worse, if the weather system (yes a weather system!) is sunny, then the game will build even faster. I love the time pressure as it makes this game go much faster than it otherwise would. The contract cards make for an interesting decision and obtaining a train to bring your third worker up from the pub is fraught with trade-offs. This game doesn't look like much, but it's pretty fantastic.

We are railroad companies racing to lay rail up Snowdonia mountain. Worker placement. Random draw colored cubes for coal, iron, and events. Weather forecast impacts productivity. Random cards laid around the main board represent the work required to build the rail. We score points along the way. Constant struggle between short term resources against long term moves. First player is huge on how an action works for the turn. My group only tolerates so many train games. Between this one and Russian Railroads.

Seems to be more than just the usual worker placement game.

Played once with five players, once with four. It's a medium weight worker placement game with a well-considered theme of Welsh mountain railway building. The explanation could take a while, as there are lots of things to explain, but the game plays quickly once you get the hang of it. You have only two workers to use each turn (although you can temporarily increase it to three if you purchase a train) and of course there's always more you'd like to do. There's a bit of resource conversion, but thankfully not too much, only iron into steel and rubble into stone.

The game has a sort of timer so it can't drag on too long: as event cubes are drawn from the bag, the game moves towards its end, with the game building, excavating and constructing track that the players would otherwise have had access to had they been a bit quicker. I like the mechanism for determining how this happens - the more the players are hoarding cubes, the more likely it is that the game will complete buildings on its own. However, I felt the game built too fast, removing opportunities from the players. I'd like to see a slightly slower progression as we were left with very little to do in the endgame. It could be that the designer has a dislike of cube hoarding strategies in Eurogames, so decided to make it unattractive here.

There are many different endgame scoring cards which can be collected by players along the way, all of which give some sort of in-game bonus. It's great to have something to aim for, but these seem essential to winning. I can't imagine anyone getting a competitive score without some of these Contract Cards in their tableau - a similar problem to that seen in [thing=58421][/thing], where taking extra Sphinx cards is sadly a necessity. I wonder if giving each player one goal at random at the start of the game would ease or exacerbate this problem? They do add quite a bit of nice decision-making to the game: do I get Contract cards early so I know what I'm trying to aim for, or do I get them later when I've already completed some track or buildings, so I know which cards will benefit me most? Do I prioritise the Contract card action space since otherwise I may miss out on one which is great for me? On the other hand, they also add an amount of luck into the game. You can see a goal appear in the late game that happens to fit in with what you've built - you may get it, you may not; it depends on where you are in the turn order and whether the players going before you take the card to prevent you from having it. So, I'm on the fence about this aspect. Certainly, players should go in knowing the cards will have a big impact on the game.

It's a good game that I'd be happy to play again. One thing troubled me in particular: when the weather turns foggy, no excavation or track laying can occur, but you can still send your surveyor higher up Snowdonia. Surely Mountain Rescue would have something to say about that. ;)

Snowdonia is a game that has grown on me with each individual play. My first game left me with somewhat mixed feelings but I think that was mainly due to me not fully understanding everything and the importance of the end game bonuses on the cards.

The core mechanics of the game are quite simple as it is essentially just a worker placement game. Although, how everything comes together with the weather and the cards makes it very interesting and different from the other worker placement games that I have. The game also scales very well, which makes it a very tense and tight game as every position on the board become contested and being able to see what the weather is going to be like in future turns really drives the need to plan each turn out well.

I am actually surprised that I haven't played this game more... especially having played it fairly recently again and remembering how much I enjoy it. The fact that I've only played the initial version of the game (the base game comes with two game set-ups) and I have an expansion that gives two additional scenarios, I should really play it again to see how they change thins up.

Really enjoyable euro, although it's possible that in a three player game the fight over first player is too critical.  I also noticed that the scores were ridiculously close for a first play through on the part of all three players.  This could be because the mechanisms are easily understood, or it could be that the game is self-balancing.  The former is fine.  If it's the latter, that could be a problem.

More plays are needed, but at first blush, this is a keeper.

This is a lovely what I call "Second Tier" worker placement game.  Its a bit heavier than something like Lords of Waterdeep, but a perfect next step.  Add to it the variety of scenarios and I'm sure I'll be playing this one for years to come.

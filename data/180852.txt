Really good! A meaty game packed in a small box. Working placement with a bit of push your luck. Taking points off for the rule book as it could be better written. Game gets better with each play.

Edit: dropped to 7 after a few plays. The buildings felt tacked on as they generally are only for one time use before moving to a new building.

There's potential in this lovely, thematic game - it has several nice Euro-ideas in play including owning buildings which others can use (but must pay), a shared majority scoring system and some interesting card play. But it falls because it presents as a strategy game yet mixes in far too much luck in the card play. The conflict with cards is dependent on what cards you're dealt - and not a lot to mitigate that. And the gunfight is a die throw - which can of course go quite poorly repeatedly. This also drains away any chance to strategize.

At its core, Tiny Epic Western is a worker placing resource converter (turn three kinds of base resource into buildings, buildings generate victory points).  In my book that's about as wearisome as game design gets.  Scott Almes raises my interest a little by adding a touch of poker and a dash of direct interaction in the form of duels, though the results of the latter are pretty random.  None of this is very engaging.

Tiny Epic Western is nicely produced.  I particularly liked the bullet dice.  The artwork adds some decent Old West flavour.

Decent game based around poker where you have a few tactical options and ways to mitigate a bad hand.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Felt overly complex with largely disparate parts for a small game. As keen poker players I thought this would resonate, but it felt confusing. Unfortunately I can't see it getting played enough for it to become streamlined so will probably forever linger at the back of the cupboard.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
The most of my plays were solo-sessions. I really like this game. Quick setup, funny gameplay and I love the artwork. 

Also the fact of playing three hand poker in combination with worker-placement makes this game something special.

RATING: 9
A close second to Tiny Epic Galaxies for multiplayer and the best solo game to date.  I was sceptical about having a poker mechanic in a game but it works really well and goes brilliantly with the wild west theme.

A far deeper worker placement game than the tiny box would lead you to believe.

Many ingenious mechanics make for a challenging strategic game. The rules feel complex and overwhelming to new players, but after one game it all makes sense. Sadly, one game is enough for a year, because it is not rewarding enough considering all the set up each round.
30-45min?! Sorry, how do you do these estimates? Played four times and I can say it is double that!
Btw, the rancher is definitely OP. That char was banned after game one, but I guess you could house rule its ability to be more expensive.

Brilliant how the worker placement, dueling and poker elements all combine into a portable and thematic experience. I mean, it is CRAZY how much you get out of this little box, perhaps moreso than all the previous games in this line. Now, add to that the fact there's a solo mode with several difficulty levels. Each Boss has a variable player power, and with the variety of player counts and buildings, you'll never quite play the same way twice. Surpasses Galaxies as my favorite game in the line to date.

Initial Impression: My impressions of this game are very miexed. On the one hand, I love the Western theme and feel that the designer did a wonderful job of incorporating that into his game. The artwork, the duelling, and the poker hand mechanisms all exude "Western theme" very well. On the other hand, I had a difficult time wrapping my head around the tactical decisions involved with the poker mechanism. Many times, I would place my posse on a building, sure that I would score the flop, only to realize that I'd misinterpreted the cards and I'd invested in a building with no chance of payoff. As well, the rulebook left us scratching our heads more than once. In the end, I think it'll take a number of plays in order to get my comfort level to the point where the decisions and implications become visible to me.

RATING: 6
I love the poker element in the game. Having played well over 1000 hours of live poker in my life, I'm always looking for a game that implements poker well.

The 1st play, I mostly drew good poker cards. I could plan my moves based on where I either would win or had a good chance to win. This created a very fun and strategic game. In the second game, I drew mostly bad poker cards. This meant I was placing with the assumption that I would not win a location, which made the game less fun.

Also, they must have run out of unique ideas for building powers, because many are repeated, with the variable changed. This killed what should have been one of the more dynamic parts of the game.

Overall, a perfect example of a 6. Not a bad game, but not that much fun to play. Also, the rulebook is not good.

Am puzzled by how underrated this game is! TEW is one of the most innovative and FUN Worker Placement games I've ever played. Actually, it can't be categorized as a Worker Placement game as it's more of a equal MASH-UP of Worker Placement, Area Control & Set Collection, with some Poker thrown on top of all that to add mystery to the outcome of your actions! Very Unique, and well designed.

My gripes are:
- While the game of Poker by its nature is based on a random draw, The Poker Mechanic in this game can crimp the player too much if when choosing his hand card, all he has to choose from is a pair. I'd suggest a rule that if dealt a pair, the player has the option to state that he has a pair, discard it, and draw a blind card off the top of the deck to become his hand.
- The iconography used to denote wild Influence rewards is 100% backward. While playable, it's counter-intuitive and thusly causes some unnecessary stumbling during the first game.
If it wasn't for the above two gripes, I would've rated that game at least a nine - yes, it's that innovative, good, and fun!

- Finally, my last "gripe" is that the Rancher is too overpowered and thusly should be reserved for use only by players who are new to the board gaming hobby, as a handicapping device.

Takes some getting used to with the poker cards and the final scoring is not very well explained at all. The example doesn't really give it to you based on a person's cards like it should. It is a fun quick game however and I love the theme.

Played this once for the first time today. I still like Tiny Epic Quest better, but this was quite fun to play once the mechanics *clicked*. It is a bit finicky, but it is thematic and has multiple layers of complexity when deciding where to place your meeple this round. Variable player powers are also a nice touch.

Best in the series so far... but as with all of the games in this line so far, they always seem to be missing something to make me want to come back for more.  I like the puzzle that have to figure out once you get your poker card.  Do you go for the stuff you need... or do you go for the stuff you know you can win easily due to your poker hand?  What will the turn order be when buying buildings?  Components in the game are nice, and the bullet dice surprisingly were fun to use (and worked well).

I enjoyed my first play for the most part, but dueling really rubbed me the wrong way. For the most part, I didn't want to initiate duels and when a duel did happen, if my card was too low, it felt very frustrating knowing my opponent could just flip a higher card to beat me. I'll need more plays to see how I feel about this I think.

Tiny Epic Western... Another Tiny Epic game and another disappointment. While not the worst in the line, its not the best either. The duel mechanic is seriously dumb... This is probably the Tiny Epic game that finally makes me stop backing his Kickstarter projects.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
So frustrating. The core gameplay is fun, and the mechanics are solid. Unfortunately, the "one card" rule ruins the game for me: since certain cards are objectively better than others, while some players have to spend half their actions just to get better card, other lucky players (who were dealt a good card) can simply use their actions to advance their score. If this happens to someone two or three times over the game, some players will fall hopelessly behind. It's an extremely swingy and unsatisfying mechanic, with too few ways to mediate the luck. Sold.

The artwork is perfect with the theme, the poker and duel stuffs are interesting and very much fun. But the problem is they're not integrated well. It's basically a worker-placement game, and the scoring is based on buying the building cards. The problem is the building cards is linked with which action space they're at. It leads to an awkward feeling that players are not competing for the action space, they're competing for the right to buy the buildings. I try to separate the building cards from the action space to see if there's a better synergy of the mechanic, but fail to work. 

I mean, the poker and duel thing are fun, but it feels like they decide to design a game with poker and duel, then build everything randomly on top of it.

The most complicated of all the Tiny Epic -series until now. 
A healthy combination of luck, decision-making, bluff and cardplay. 
Thematic consistent.
I had a rather preferred another style of graphics, but that's a matter of taste.
Flawless rulebook.
No of your products are on my resale-list. 
Beware it tooks us two hours to play this. Not the 30-45 minutes on the box. No problem for us.
You must be able to accept the luck of dicerolls and cards to enjoy this game.
Player aid print is to small for middle-aged eyes as mine. ;-)
Tiny in shelfspace, but not so tiny in table-space and game-play.
This is like the mini-cooper from the 70's, small but definitly a sports-car. 
Mr. Almes, you and your team are performant game-designers in my opinion.

Of the three games I've played in the "Tiny Epic" series (did not play Defenders), this is the weakest.

Flavorful game - the six-shooter dice are a neat component and the cowboy meeples are great. I especially enjoy the transparent "Wanted" card that came with the Kickstarter edition and the fact that it was created based on a backer suggestion. It does well for a worker placement game, offering an interesting mix of choices and risk-reward. However, there is a great deal of randomness in play due to dice-rolling and your chance to win resources being dependent on a poker hand. Past that, the biggest knock against this game is that your end-game score is only impacted by the buildings you purchase. It often feels like you're doing several exciting things like gathering resources, dueling, or winning poker hands, but unless you're able to buy the best set of 5 or so buildings the rest of what you did doesn't matter for the endgame.

Why this isn't a 10:
-> Poker and especially dice lead to several un-fun turns
-> Varied mechanics distill into single score mechanism

Acquired in trade 11/16 - Worker placement is one of my favorite mechanics, and I was looking for smaller games with shorter playtimes.
A solid workhorse smaller WP game that I will probably return to with decent frequency.

RATING: N/A
The theme is fun and fits well regarding worker placement duels, but beyond that it doesn't really aid in many rule nmemonics, and there is a lot to commit to memory. Once the rules are sorted and you're over the learning curve its a pretty decent game. The playing footprint is bigger than you think, but all components certainly fit nicely into a tiny, beautiful box.

Being the fourth game in the Tny Epic line, TEW has a lot to live up to, especially after how amazing TEG was. Having played the prototype through a few times with different player counts I can say that TEW comes in just under TEG and will probably beat out TEK once the production version is available. The prototype plays well for what it is and still offers a good amount of variety. I know that by the time the Kickstarter is done it will look amazing and have a lot more to offer. The game plays amazingly with 3 and even better with 4 players. The 2 player game doesn't offer enough conflict to make it an enjoyable 2 player experience for me, but still does what it sets out to do. 

The only negative was the rule book and trying to teach this to people not as familiar with games. But I hope to see some rules better explained in the production rule book and am sure that the post kickstarter components will be much easier to understand. 

I look forward to backing this project when it launches and hope that Gamlyn Games continues to bring us the Tiny Epic line.

2016-10-18 : After the elegantly designed Tiny Epic Galaxies with its fluid and fast-playing mechanics I was really looking forward to this game. What a let-down. This game is almost the definition of in-elegant, outstays its welcome by over an hour, has too many fiddly rules and mechanics, player powers that are out of whack and where players simply cannot balance the game because of the way the poker hands work. So much fluff was thrown into this I was really expecting the kitchen sink to appear at a certain moment. What this game needed was a developer who had the guts to scratch half the mechanics and return the series to the elegant simplicity that it used to have. Bought at Spiel on Saturday and went on the trade-pile on Monday. Must be a new record.

Tiny Epic Western was my first foray into Kick starter backing. After a bit of research it felt like it was a fairly safe investment and I was not disappointed. a full board game experience in a box that fits into your backpack or bag. what I will say is that this game feels overwhelming as hell. I watched Rodney Smiths how to play video at least 5 times and I still felt like I want getting it. however me and a friend took our time and went through a game. and then something just clicked and once you have played that first round it all becomes so simple. thats not to say that this game is easy. its a unique balance of worker placement, poker and resource management. the goal to acquire buildings and get victory points. the whole experience takes about 30 minutes. 

It also has a single player variant which I feel a lot of games would benefit from

I would highly recommend this game to anyone but with the caveat that you learn to play a round to be able to explain it to others as the rules can put people off.

My second Tiny Epic game and I'm left with the same feelings as the first--I wish it wasn't so tiny. The designer accomplishes exactly what they set out to do, and the poker element of the game works very well. Unfortunately, at the end, it's just a set collection game with some extra VP thrown in. Not a waste of time, per se, but it could be deeper.

RATING: 6
Interesting combination of worker placement, dice shoot-outs, and poker, with gorgeous components. However, the game has a high learning curve, is a bit fiddly, and is not nearly as elegant as Tiny Epic Galaxies (which, being the preceding game in the series, it will inevitably be compared against).

Nice pokergame with a twist of worker placement. I enjoyed it. Don't set your hopes for a big worker placement game, then you will be a bit dissapointed, approach it as a fun poker game. Fun game in a small box. Perfect for when you travel!

One game so far. The novelty of the small box makes it easy to bring with, and there's a lot of depth. I wasn't blown away by it at first, but I do want to try it again and see how well it works in a second game.

Update: After trying again, this feels like a baffling number of systems in a tiny box. Compared to Galaxies, we weren't as impressed with Western in the long run.

RATING: 5
The game works fine but it is more difficult to learn than necessary. What keeps me from playing this more often is the industrial/building aspect of the theme. I much rather complete tasks such as cattle rustling, defending/robbing a stage coach, etc... than abstractly buying buildings to control an industry for victory points. The mismatch of an economics game with a area control/dueling mechanic and variable characters is not germane for me. Feels like a missed opportunity...

Egyáltalán nem tiny, inkább közepesnél nehezebb játék, ami nem baj egyáltalán, mert nagyon jól sikerült darab. A pokerhandes működéstől eléggé viszolygok, de itt sikerült nagyszerűen implementálni. Egyszerre tematikus és agyalós. Ügyes tervezés, mert 3-4 egyszerű dolgot tettek egymástól függővé, és így egyszerre ennyi síkot megvizsgálva kell megtalálni az optimális lépést. Ebbe visz némi véletlenszerűséget az rejtett játékos keze, így nem lehet tutira menni szinte sehol.
Kettesben azért nem 100%-osan működött, mert nem volt nagyon kikényszerítve a harc. Többen ez durva lehet, lehet hogy ott azért bosszantóvá is tud válni a kockás harcolás.
Jó "kis" darab.

RATING: 8
In TINY EPIC WESTERN spielt das "Tiny" die geringste Rolle. Dafür hält der Epische Western, was er Westernfreunden as me verspricht. Die 6 Runden dehnen sich länger über die Zeit, als man denkt, denn TEW hat seine überraschend kniffligen taktischen Finessen. Dabei ist das Poker-Element die zentrale kreative und innerhalb des Gattungssegments WP auch innovative Idee des Spiels, die ihm ein inhaltlich gutes und atmosphärisch spannendes Western-Flair mit Bluff und Risk verleiht. Je nach "Blatt" muss man sich nämlich Runde für Runde gut überlegen auf welchem der Orte auf den fünf Gebäuden man seine beiden Cowboys einsetzt. Einziger Wackel-Point ist für mich zunächst das sehr knappe Ergebnis, das auf ein very balanced Game mit chronisch minimalen Punkunterschieden hindeuten könnte. Anyway. TEW finde ich deutlich anspruchsvoller, besser und thematisch konsistenter als sein großer Bruder aus der Galaxie. Das "Tiny" macht das Handling der drei Genre-Ressourcen "law", "money" und "force" auf einem Track zwar etwas fummelig, ist aber eine verzeihbar verstimmte Note im Saloonklavier. In seinem molligen Grundton ist TINY EPIC WESTERN deutlich mehr Experte als Kenner.

Reminds me of two other western themed games - Carson City and Montana, both of which it borrows ideas from, both of which it is far inferior to. I'd rather play either of those than this. Also, a layout that assures that *every* player has to view at least half the text upside down... not a good idea.

The blend of poker with the western theme comes through as a half-way decent area control game. You don't really feel as if you're ever having a shoot out, just a show of hands. If you want a better western themed game, check out Carson City or Doomtown Reloaded. Not as good as Tiny Epic Galaxies, but still fun.

Interesting game, need to play it more for a better feel for it.  The initial card choice is critical and more complex than I initially thought.  You end up evaluating 10 possible options with suite and value shifts on two cards, and the odds of controlling the shift. 

The rest of the game is pretty straight forward.   Except for control of the buy order, this is critical.   There are many factors in play, as it's difficult to get all your placements and control, in a turn.

Juegazo como la copa de un pino. No es un copia y pega cambiando tematica. Es diferente de los anteriores, y es magnifico en jugabilidad, y todo ello en la caja de un filler. Lo dicho: juegazo. 

Por criticar algo, se puede mencionar que en ilustraciones flojea un poco... pero nah, solo estoy buscando excusas para rajar un pelin. En serio, jugadlo.

Nice little worker placement game with a good theme. You only have two workers so choosing where to put them is crucial. Player interaction comes in the form of duels which also add an element of push your luck. Takes a lot of table space for such a small box though. (26.4.2017)

Better with 4 players than 3. There's more competition for spaces and more duels. Can be pretty brainburning at times when you eyeball the cards and compare what hands to make with your cards and try to line them up with what buildings you want to buy. Packs quite the punch for a very small box. One gripe is the blue and green player colors which can be pretty hard to distinguish. Why they didn't use white or black for at least one them baffles me.

I have certainly played worse worker-placement designs, but I've also played better. The best part is probably the poker aspect, wherein you play mini poker hands to win resources & influence stock values. The worst part is the D6-based combat which is a little too simple and luck dependent for its own good. I probably won't play this again, but it gets a 5 instead of a 4, because of the clever poker element.

Interesting concept of a worker placement game with the elements of betting. I enjoy the idea of betting that you will have the best hand in order to get those extra rewards.

Combination of worker placement and 3 card poker hands.

Seems to be a little bit to random for my liking (played with a group of people who play poker so we know the hand ratings well), just feels like sometimes plans can be stopped due to randomness, which I don't care for in a worker placement.

Same with the "gunfighting" mechanic which relies on dice rolling.

Would play again, but not my first choice.

Although lighter in gameplay than Tiny Epic Galaxies I prefer this one as it plays faster and the theme really comes to life in the mechanic. It's also the most unique worker placememt I have seen, mixing poker and worker placement together with individual player powers and majority control. Has a high interaction and a higher bit of luck than other Tiny Epic games, but still like this one best.

Boy there's a lot going on here for a small game.  And that's a good thing! This is the kind of game that I find somewhat difficult to teach to new people and this makes it tough to get on to the table.  There are a great variety of locations and these cards have all kinds of iconography and can sometimes be wordy.  Given the amount of cards that can be at the table, this can make for some downtime as players try to read what is on the cards.

It takes a little time for the strategies in this game to become apparent when you're new to it.  There's a good bit of "well I want to buy this card, so I should try to get a posse guy here, but I need these other resources to buy that card so my other guy should go here, but wait this other card has the stock symbols I think I need so maybe I should buy that one, but wait my poker hand isn't strong enough!", etc.  

However, for those willing to invest the time getting to know this little game, I think you will be rewarded with an interesting, thoughtful, thematic, and fun time.  

I enjoy Tiny Epic Galaxies a bit more.

Pretty interesting game. Great graphic design and decent art. The best "Tiny Epic" game I've played yet. Also, variable player powers, yay.

Downsides: way too long for how light it is. Also, Luck is a very big factor. It's ok with the duels, plenty of mitigation and stuff. But the cards you get dealt every round have a massive impact.

Players take on the role of a western character who is trying to gain the most real estate and prestige in a western town. The value of that real estate can be influenced by industry as well. Players duel when purchasing disputes arise and many elements of the game are governed by a simplified version of poker. There is a lot going on in this little game and it can be difficult to master!

RATING: 5.5
The game is very long for the proposal, it does not make sense to make a game that small that takes 2 hours to play. However, my major criticism is with the poker cards, which are acquired at random and the highest the value, the better (in most of the cases). This cards are used to make poker hands and to increase duel power, making a huge swing from 1 to 5 (maximum value). Also, during a duel, there is a die... So a double random element for a somewhat "Eurogame". Also, the characters and builds are, definately, unbalanced.

Nagyon jó ötletek vannak benne. A pókeres rész kiváló, egyszerű, de mégis érdekes, szuperül működik, hogy egyszerre vagy versenyben a többi játékossal, meg "a játék" ellen. Emellé viszont a többi szabály kicsit sok. A lapokon bőven van elemeznivaló. Szimbólumok, amiket a játék végéhez gyűjtögetünk, viszonylag sok szöveges lapképességek, amiket azért nem könnyű átlátni. A harcolás nem egy agyas dolog, kb. annyiból érdekes, hogy rakhattak bele töltény alakú hatoldalú dobótesteket. A játékidő, meg a szabályok viszonylagos összetettsége eléggé megkérdőjelezi számomra, hogy az egymás elleni harc valóban rendben van-e így. Mondjuk nem sok volt a háromfős játékban, szóval talán nem perdöntő. Viszonylag gyakran alakult ki döntetlen, ezek feloldása nem minden esetben megnyugtató.
Tényleg úgy érzem, hogy a kevesebb több lett volna, mert a látvány, a játéktér struktúrája, a pókeres ötlet mind-mind szuper. De a lapok képességei eléggé megnehezítik az alapvető könnyedség kiélvezését.

I really enjoy this one, especially solo. Having 2-3 workers makes the placement very tight. Deciding between immediate benefits and delayed but increased benefits is tricky and leaves you vulnerable to a duel. Think about where you need to go to get resources, and then being on the right territory to buy a building, all the while taking into account whether or not you will win the pot at each location makes for a deceivingly complex game. 

Many have complained about the complexity of the rules. However, once you understand the four phases of the game and when each phase triggers, it is really simple and flows well. It rewards multiple plays in this regard. 

My only major detractor are the player powers. I definitely find myself using some more than others which leads me to wonder whether or not some of them are more advantageous. However, it may just be that I do not see the underlying strategy of some of them. 

I highly recommend this game.

This is the only game I own with a Western theme. There are some interesting and novel mechanics in this game. I like the use of 3-card poker to settle duels and the resolution step. Choose your hole card carefully because it will be used to complete several different hands.

I like western themed games and this 'little' game is a pretty good one. The poker hand resolution to win various resources is somewhat luck based as there really isn't much in the way of bluffing, but this doesn't affect the overall fun factor.

RATING: 6
Bought this game after backing Tiny Epic Quest and after purchasing Tiny Epic Galaxies and really liking that game. I live in Tucson, AZ so the western theme looked really fun to me. I really liked the "bullet dice", great fitting in with the whole motif. 

I have a 2 year old so my gaming time is limited. My friends and I don't get together as much as we wish we could due to working schedules and such. All the games I buy need to have a solo aspect to them I've discovered (unplayed, pre-ordered "Star Wars Rebellion" can attest to that!).  Gamelyn Games "Tiny Epic" game series has definitely fit the bill there for me! Their games are low on cost and high in value and production quality. 

Out of the 3 I've played now (Galaxies, Western and the pnp Quest) all 3 are different mechanics and game play. Galaxies is by far the fastest I can get through those games pretty quickly and set up is very fast. Quest is a little longer setup and the game play is pretty fast as well though. Western has the longest and largest setup space needed. I purchased the map for this game as it looked GREAT and I thought it would make set up nicer, which it does! I love how it looks like a poker table too! 

My wife actually saw this and wanted to play, she's not a gamer. She ended up winning so maybe I'll be able to get her to play more so thats good! I have only got to play the solo game a couple of times on this one so far and I've lost pretty badly both times. I suspect I'm not doing something exactly right but when I get more time I'll dig deeper into what I need to do to give myself a fighting chance. I had fun the times I did get to play though. Now that the holidays are over and "real life" is coming back I anticipate having more free time to devote into playing this one more.

I'm really looking forward to playing this game with my cousins (one lives in PA so I don't get to see him as much as I'd like), they like poker and I think they'll find the poker aspect of this game pretty fun and light hearted. They like strategizing and I think this will fit the bill and give us something we can play several games of and have fun doing!  Plus dueling is always fun too, especially with the previously mentioned Bullet Dice. Just gives the feel of a shoot out really for me, very fun and clever idea! The amount of "Bosses" is impressive to me too. Very nice selection of players and gives a great replayability  which is always a added bonus.

saw a review on here dub this "tiny epic brainmelt" and that's a wonderful description. so much thought is required for this little game that it *does* end up feeling pretty epic (sorry, tom) by the end. while this does melt your brain, it's *just* right. like a mid-shelf bourbon on the rocks, it'll give you that burn your crave, but leave enough left for one or two more. you could start or end your day on this one, and it'll hit the spot. bravo.

RATING: 5
The game is too dependent on the luck of your poker cards. I felt bad watching others lose to my luckier hands of cards. Additionally, I think it would have been better to not have special abilities visible on the cards available to acquire since it really slows down the game for limited benefits. What I mean is that gaining a card with an ability that can be used for only 1 turn (typically) brings up the question why abilities are included - it's best o buy the card you can afford based on your resources and the ability means next to nothing.

After a second play, I dropped the rating a point to a 4. This game might be silly fun if it lasted only 30 minutes, but learning games tend to take 90 minutes and that's too long for a game with this much luck of the draw and roll of the dice. 

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Probably this would be my favorite of the Tiny Epic series but that's not saying much as I'm not a huge fan of the games - just not up my wheelhouse. There's a fair bit of randomness/luck of the draw in the game and that can be frustrating, particularly in a 6 round game.

I've played this a number of times now. It is quite good! I generally like Euro games with a bit of luck so that the best players have to improvise and the worst players actually have a chance to win from time to time.

It is simple enough to play, and your luck can be mitigated quite a bit by choosing actions that have immediate rewards. Locations also have a jackpot. You can play three card poker for it by combining the one card you are dealt with the two cards at your location, so it is another way to get your rewards. You spend your rewards to edge out others in duels and buy new locations for your porch (which gives you some points and some stocks which will translate to points for the majority holders).

The gimmicky bullet dice are a great addition, too. If you get good at rolling them in just the right way on your wooden table, it sounds just like you are spinning the chamber of a revolver. Too fun!

There are way too many mechanics that makes this game feel extremely random. You have a bunch of choices to make during your turn and throughout the game but, because you have so many, you don't really feel in control of what's going on.

For example, at the beginning of your turn you choose between 2 playing cards. As a side note, another annoyance is none of the suits are not what they should be. Anyway, you have to decide if one of those cards will be good in 6 different poker hands and if it'll be good as a high card for dueling your opponents. If you are playing 3 opponents and the dealer then there are 4 hidden cards. Not only that, but your card's number and suit can be changed from a building's ability. This "choice" might as well be random. You are not going to figure out the optimal probability from all those variables especially given that the card can "change" during a round of play.

Then, as the game progresses, the abilities from the porches changes from round to round as people buy more buildings. Which makes trying to plan from round to round useless. And if you do get on a useful spot, you can be removed through a duel.

Winning duels is based on a die roll, more randomness, and your poker card. Of course, if you loose the die roll then you can use some of your resources to re-roll. That will probably negate any reason to take that spot in the first place so I don't know why you would ever do this.

Then there is the points modifier at the town hall. Whoever wins their poker hand against the other opponents will be able to modify the scores on their buildings. The tiles move in a weird stacking order based on their position. So, if you win the poker hand, and the tile is in the right position, and it's a tile that matches a majority of symbols on your buildings, then you can boost the modifier.

Lastly, if you can't do anything on your turn then you can get another dude for the next turn. Honestly it feels like the designers admitting that you can easily get screwed over and maybe this extra worker will even it out. In reality it's more like throwing another working into the meat grinder. If you got screwed over the last round with having a bad hand and losing some duels adding another worker just adds another chance to be screwed.

So a game goes: at the beginning of your turn you choose a card to be used for dueling, building order, and resource gathering on buildings. A value that can change for you or your opponents. Good luck. Then, you start placing workers trying to get some resources to buy buildings which is affected by that same card. Good luck. And, if someone else wants that spot then hope you can roll high and/or have a high card to win to get resources. Good luck. Then hope that your card is good enough to beat the dealer so that you can nudge a score modifier for your buildings. Good luck. But, if you get screwed over this round then you get another worker next round to throw into this pachinko machine.

This game is terrible. One of the four of us thought it was 'ok' so I'll probably just give this to him. None of the rest of us ever want to play this mess again.

If you want a better game then look no further than Tiny Epic Galaxies. It's like night and day difference in how fun it is to this random junk. Everyone I've played TEG with has enjoyed it and would play it again any day.

Played early prototype at BGG Con 2014 and refined version at Gen Con 2015.  Very deep strategy and super-appealing layout and flow.

Seriously.  Bullet dice.

It's a fun enough game. There were two things I didn't like about it. First is that victory points are pretty much only gotten through buying buildings which you mostly only get to do once a round, so if you can't buy a building for whatever reason you get set back. Second the buildings purchased only stay out one round and give you very little benefit. Overall though the poker mechanic is neat and the game is still fun enough that I would play it again.

Generally felt a little blasé.  I liked how the cards came into play at the end of each round, but the actually rounds were just ... meh.  The special powers of each building rarely kicked in, so it generally just felt like you should get buildings with high points.  And, while collecting the icons gave you a bit more to do, the payoff wasn't worth really focusing on them.

I really want to like this game more than I do. It's great, but there's so many things that are just minuses for me.
It's not very good with 2 players, which is usually how I play games, so that's a downfall. At more players it's fun in an intense way, but lasts far too long for what it is. The variable player powers are cool, but sometimes too specific. 
I'm never a fan of a game-controlled player, so that's another negative for me. There's that, card dealing, and dice rolling, plus the fact that the worker spaces change each round as cards are bought, moved, and covered, and all that is just too much randomness for me. 
Not sure how it could be improved for my liking. But a great game if you don't mind the things I've mentioned!

Puntos fuertes: Bueno, bonito y barato. Es un juego con chicha a pesar de su tamaño. La mezcla de póquer y colocación de trabajadores, ambientado en el lejano oeste está muy bien traída. El diseño en general está cuidado, aunque no requiere de grandes ilustraciones. Los dados son fantásticos, esa forma de bala es todo un TAKE MY MONEY. Los componentes tienen bastante calidad para el precio del juego (entorno a 20€ en 2017). Transportable, aunque requiere espacio.

Puntos débiles: Un poco complicado en las primeras partidas. 

Conclusión: No es un filler para nada. Te hace pensar. Reconocemos que íbamos por Pequeñas Grandes Galaxias, y nos compramos este porque no quedaban un poco reacios. No obstante, salimos contentos después de jugarlo. Una buena compra.

After a few playthroughs, this game actually has a lot going for it. There's a lot of interaction from the dueling aspect and the poker hand aspect. With the former, there's a limited number of spaces to get what you need, so dueling is the best way to get what you want. The game also goes by fairly quickly.

My only concern that on the first play through, especially for newcomers, there's A LOT going on, and it's a lot to take in. One of my friends was turned away from the game just because it was a lot to take in on the first try. As with any game though, play it a second or third time, and it'll get streamlined and easier to take in.

Overall, a great spin on worker placement, and a good game to play overall. Good Kickstarter game in my book!

This is the first Tiny Epic game I've really disliked. I loved Kingdoms, really liked Defenders, and thought Galaxies was okay. Western feels like a rehash of a lot of other games Almes has come out with, including Kingdoms, along with his take on other Western-themed worker placement games like Carson City. There are some clever things going on, such as how the poker cards are handled from round to round. I feel like there aren't enough spaces to visit though, and the ones that are there are essentially taking different kinds of influence (See: resources), making this yet another cube-pushing snooze-fest. The fighting feels a bit tacked-on as well. Even though it's a much breezier game, I think I prefer Deadwood for something with this theme and mechanisms. No poker hands there, but not every Western-themed game has to have them.

I dodged a bullet here. Almost backed this on Kickstarter, didn't, and now after playing it I'm glad I didn't. I love the western theme, but this game just fell flat for me, took too long for what it was, and that was only with 2 players. I think more players might make the game better, but would just add unnecessary time.

First play: there are a lot of cards that need to be looked at and read each round making this a bit fiddly and AP prone. Have only played 2 player which was enjoyable but need to play with more. 6.5

EDIT: Second play and getting the hang of it. Much more enjoyable. Still a lot of reading of cards before choosing various options but I am liking this. 7.5

RATING: 6
A 1-4 player worker placement game that combines poker mechanics with some limited conflict in the form of dueling someone else's worker in order to take their spot.

Although the mechanics all work well enough, the game is strangely fiddly (for a Tiny Epic game) and takes longer than it should due mainly to a combination of multiple card interactions that happen at varying times during the turn and having to frequently compare poker hands with cards spread around all over the table.

Honestly, this game feels VERY similar to "Deadwood" that Fantasy Flight published in 2011 and does nothing to improve on that game besides adding the somewhat ham-fisted poker mechanic.

It is impressive how much game they cram into this tiny box. The name really suits the game and not only is it tiny, but the western theme works right down to the bullet as a dice. Looks aside, the game play is quite deep as you place your workers to gain benefits while at the same time fighting and creating a three card poker hand to win extra benefits. There are a few things to balance at a time and it works really well as a package.

Scott Almes is a good designer, I like just about everything he's made. But, like the other Tiny Epics, this game should have been a "big box" game, with better components. 
The game is good, if a little confusing at first. Just enough things you have to keep track of, just enough conflict, just enough everything. Except it's tiny. 
Production quality is part of the game's appeal and it's beyond me why they sould want to cram so much game in such a small package.

Our 1 play with 4 (2 new) took way more then the 45 minutes it should take. And that's my big issue with this game: it has the gaming time of a 'serious' game, but has the luck - factor of a family game. It already starts with the character you get. Some are clearly better then others. Then you get a Poker-card. It seemed like a nice gimmick in the beginning to me, but it is in fact a huge deal and can make the difference between being able to buy a building or not. And having control over which colour will score big time is very important as it makes the difference between winning or losing. 
And then of course you have the dice rolling. You sort of have the illusion you can manipulate it buy discarding a grey of blue, but will you do that if that makes you can't buy the card you're going for anyway?

Uses an established card game (they call it poker but really it's three card brag) well as a major mechanic. There's a fair amount of luck with which cards you get but not so much that strategy and tactics aren't important too. It's almost a little too long for the kind of game it is but fortunately just avoids going too long.

I wasn't a big fan of the first TEK game but I was hearing good things about TEW so decided to get it in a math trade. I like poker and I heard it had some of that involved. It does to a small extent. There can be a fair bit of luck involved. If you are playing for the first time I recommend not using player abilities. I have only played once so far and we found the player abilities pretty unbalanced and it really ruined my experience. I heard it plays well without abilities and I am willing to play again to see how I like it more. Some times it just comes down to the luck of the die roll. Super cool bullet dice, but still a die roll. Wanted to love more than I did.

RATING: 3
Pros:
1. Component Quality - The components in this game are incredible. Love the bullet dice.
2. Poker Resolution - Using 3 card poker to resolve spots was very interesting. I don't think it worked as well as I wanted it to, but I did find it interesting.
3. Dueling - Again, I thought this was a great idea. A player can take the instant reward and not worry about duel or risk it for a bigger reward, but risk losing it through duel. This was interesting, but didn't work as well as I thought it would.

Cons:
1. One Route to Victory - You get points from building structures. You also get points from the industry tracks based on what's also on your structures. The only way to get points in this game is through structures. This makes for a very one dimensional game.
2. Orientation - The orientation of all the pieces that make the board are visually interesting, but makes it really difficult to read. Some stuff is upside down, or sideways, or right side up. At least in other games, when I'm looking at an upside down board, everything is upside down.
3. Strategy - It's difficult to form any real strategy. There's so many different types of building you can buy, but it makes no difference as to which one you buy as the benefit from owning that building is minor. Nothing combos or builds off of each other. Every round is played nearly independent of the other rounds. This game could be 3 rounds or 10 rounds and there'd be no difference in the game other than point totals.
4. Luck - There's a lot of luck in this game. Much of the game is based on poker, so that's not surprising. But poker decides who wins the big bonuses, and who advances the industry track and who gets to buy first. These are all extremely important, so 2 lucky rounds can give you the game. There is some manipulation you can do your card, but it's minor at best.

Summary: This is just not a good game. There's some interesting ideas that just don't pan out. The majority of the game is just placing your worker where you think you can win the poker game. You will usually just figure out what structures you can buy later. The strategy of what structures you buy plays minimal importance, so doesn't factor into your decision. Do not purchase. Do not bother playing. There's flat out much better games.

This is a brain burner that is truly unique: combining worker placement and poker with a little resource management and don't forget you can push your luck when dueling for some chaos.  This can be played in your face for passive where everyone is doing there own thing.  So much going on in this game is really would take 3 or 4 plays to really get into the 45 minute range.  It a lot of punch for  a tiny box.

Surprised at how placing a single worker requires analysis of so many other factors.

It took me four games but I've finally broken myself of buying the Tiny Epic games. The enthusiasm of the creators is infectious but none of the four that I got did anything special. Playing them feels not quite like a chore but definitely obligatory in a lot of ways. No one that I've introduced the games to has been excited about any of it - bland art, bland theme, bland components, bland mechanics. Tiny Epic Bland.

RATING: 8.5
This is my first venture into the "tiny epic" series of games. This one doesn't get a lot of love, but it was actually the one that I thought looked the most interesting. We had a lot of fun playing this one. The worker placement is pretty straight forward. I like how there's duels when you're trying to go for the better actions. The game does a good job of trying to help with catchup mechanics. Anyone who doesn't buy a building gets an extra worker in the following round. I also am a big fan of how the 3 card poker hands work. Winning at the locations you went to can gain you more resources, but winning at the town hall has a lot of importance. You get first selection of buildings on offer for the round, but most importantly you get to decide which of the 3 industries to send up the track. Points are scarce in this game, so the industry market can be the deciding factor. There's still a decent amount of luck in this game with dice rolls and card draws, but it didn't seem to bother me at all.

Each round players place their workers on spaces around the board, most of which provide one of the three resources which are used to purchase buildings (the main point producer) at the end of each round.  The worker placement plays like a shrunken Carson City, once you place a worker another player can place theirs there and duel you to steal the spot.  At the end of each round players play a 3-card hand of Texas Hold 'Em for an additional benefit on each of the spots (even players who lost a duel get to participate in this round).

I liked it.  It was reasonably simple as far as worker placement goes.  Most of the spots, as I said, just give you combinations of the three resources.  One of my main problems with the game is that there is a "wanted" status you can get for winning a duel.  Being wanted at the end of a round gives you an additional resource and being wanted at the end of the game gives you two points.  Only one player can be wanted and to take the wanted poster you just need to win a duel with any other player.  This sucks because the wanted player can lose the poster when he isn't even involved in the duel.  This especially sucks at the end of the game when it can mean a 4-point swing.  In my opinion you should only be able to steal the wanted poster by winning a duel against the wanted player.

Past that the main thing keeping this game from shining too brightly is the whole "Tiny" gimmick.  Small box games should fit a certain play space and this game is a bit more than that.  So making it a tiny game with tiny pieces and low quality components really just makes it a worse experience.  I suppose there is a market for people that want to pay half the price for the game but I would rather pay more for a better experience.  You get what you pay for.  Also, almost forgot, don't get cute with dice shapes, the bullet shaped dice are terrible.

Meh.  Some cool things but not my style of game.  I felt like decisions were fairly limited.  I felt almost obligated to play on the spaces that made my poker hand the best.  It was okay, but I can see how others might really enjoy it.

I've played [thing=148951][/thing] and [thing=163967][/thing], so this is my third in the series.  Ultimately, it suffers from a lot of the same problems as the first two.  Basically, there is no reason to make the game so tiny and the components/text are too small relatively to the weight/depth of the game.  

Those complaints aside, Western may be my favorite of the three.  The selling point is the poker play feature.  Basically, each player has a poker card face down and each action space has two cards face up.  If multiple people want to take the same action, the player with the better 3 card poker hand gets an advantage.  You do get a choice of 2 or 3 cards each round for your card, so your available actions may be limited or influenced by that.  I'll also add that the art on the poker cards is fantastic and really evokes the theme.

Beyond the poker, the rest of the game is average.  There are many buildings that have various powers, but the text is too small to read them from across the table.  So, I think Western slots slightly above Galaxies and way above Kingdoms.  They all have their moments, but suffer from a mismatch between components and complexity.

This is easily my favorite worker placement game. The theme is something that is personally enjoyable to me, giving it bonus points in my book. Of all the Tiny Epic series, I would argue that this one is most suited to Gamers, and a little tougher entry to those not familiar with the hobby.

It's worker placement, with a mixture of poker/hand management. workers occupying the same space, duel for the spot by using bullet shaped dice (super thematic) and then rewards are distributed based on winning poker hands between players. 

Beware The Rancher, he's an overpowered character card, who we essentially no longer use, due to the strength he carries over other characters. 

Apart from that, the game is balanced quite well, and truly shines with 4 players

This game packs a lot of punch for a "tiny" game.  There are quite a lot of powers available to use on cards, so the flow of a game will change depending on which cards come out.  I like that sense of variety.  However, there are some many available actions, it can be hard to keep track of at times.

RATING: 6
Replace Tiny with "so" and epic with "so" and you get what this game is. The game concept worker placement meets Poker sounded really intriguing in concept and while it surely has an interesting touch it didn't manage to maintain this fascination over the course of six rounds. And if it doesn't manage to sustain interest over six rounds how does this reflect on further games? 
I think that flipping over poker cards as a means to add that number to your duel strenth ist too big of an impact and is bound to create situations where two people quarrel and the third person rejoices.
Also, the Wanted-card goes into the completely wrong direction. It rewards the beneficiary and penalizes the punished person further. Why not have the winner of a duel penalized and also scratch the end game victory points for the Wanted card? 
In our session with final scores of 24-20-17(me), I was robbed of at least 6 victoy points with the very final turn. I had the spot for building a left-over building and was challenged in a duel. The person dueling me put me on the spot after dice rolls by flipping over his poker card, I also flipped my card because I wanted to keep my resources for the buildings. Third person (the later victor) took the bait, rolled a 6 and thus, still having his card in reserve, I had no chance whatsoever. Taking away the Wanted card (2 victory points), cancelling my second purchase (which would have been worth 3 points) and taking it for himself along with the second purchase which would have provided me with enough symbols in at least one industry to gain majorities, all of a sudden the game had completely swung. It's not the losing that sucks, but that this game allows a situation like this.

To each his own, but this is precisely the sort of thinly-themed style of game that I hate. 

The back of the box touts "playing poker" and a bunch of other Western trappings, but the gameplay does not evoke even the slightest iota of any of this. This could just as well be a game about door-to-door salesmen, or virtually anything else for that matter -- just change the artwork and the text on the components! 

Unthematic gaming at its most boring. Not my cup of tea.

Pretty solid game; was hoping it beat out "Galaxies" for best Tiny Epic. I totally love the poker element, and the dueling is okay.

What whacks it up for me is the weakness and shakiness of the "post duel" thing. 

So, say you place your dude on a spot, and choose the "immediate" side of the spot. Later, someone else duels you, and you win. So you chose the immediate goodie, got dueled, and won. At the end of round 3, if you win the poker hand for that building, it FEELS like you should get the winnings for that space. But you don't—you chose the immediate goodie. 

A much better mechanic, I think, would be if you didn't choose between the immediate thingie and the later thingie. There would only be one prize, no choosing. So the first time you land on the space, you get the immediate thing. If someone later duels you, whoever wins can then stand a chance at getting the winnings for that space, whether the original posse member was going for the immediate prize or the later one. That might make it better. It just seems a little lame as is.

Can hardly wait for this one.

UPDATE: This is my favorite of the "tiny epic" line to date for one simple reason...there's a lot of game here.  The other TE games have been small and had more game than expected but still, frankly were small games and felt that way.  This game physically is still the same size in the box but really this time for once spreads out and fills a table.  Not just with components but with mechanics as well.  There is a lot going on and a lot to keep up with making this a game I'm very happy to own. 

[ImageID=554375]

As good as this game excels above the other "Tiny Epic" games it fails in the player department where the others were ok with 2.  The reason is there just needs to be a lot of meeple placement and with 2 you don't get that.  The heart of this game revolves around the 3 card poker hand and playing against the dummy card is alright once in awhile but takes away from the game when you do it over and over again.

[KS] Several novel mechanics but a little too much going on means this one takes a modicum of mental effort just to keep track of what's happening and therefore makes it less enjoyable to me - or maybe it's just my aging brain. Comes second to Galaxies in the Tiny Epic series for me.

Just played a prototype of this. We had a really tough start because if problems with the rules and iconography, but once we got going it got better. Hopefully we were close to right. I don't feel comfortable rating it at this point, but I can make a few observations.

I think is likely to be the deepest of the "Tiny Epic" games. I have Kingdoms and Galaxies. Kingdoms has less luck, but feels more like a straightforward progression. Galaxies is more similar to this, but I think there are more ways to use and manipulate your luck in West. The three resources, multiple placement options, and "poker" play makes each turn a new puzzle.

Based on their other games, I'm sure they will work out the rules issues.

Worker placement game with poker elements turns out to be poker game with worker placement elements.

There's quite a lot of dueling in this game when playing with 4 players. It's nice to have a lot of conflict and aggressive takeovers, but usually it's motivated by a lack of space on the board rather than any real reason of wanting to gain something.

It's somewhat mindless take that fun with a reasonable amount of tactical decisions here and there.

I'm very fond of this games aesthetics. The thematic card backs, bullet dice and cowboy meeples make this a game that looks the part even though it comes in a very small form factor.

Worker placement and poker. Send your posse workers around the town to gain an action, get resources, and play hands of three card Texas hold'em. Each player and the house get a hold card, the flop cards are dealt in a circle so that each building has two adding yours at the end for the best poker hand. Building actions allow changing the value of your card. I love the leaning worker placement mechanic to change the hidden value of your card as a "tell" to other players (or are you bluffing)--great. Get in some gun slinging for contested spots, spend gold, law and force to buy the largest stake in mining or rails. I dig the last poker hand at the town hall to buy first. Dig the card art of the poker cards of the old West. Tiny Epic--big game small package.  Why is it called "force"?

This very much feels like a full sized Euro game in a tiny box.  I liked how there was so much to consider with each worker you placed (ie: whether you wanted to purchase the card attached to the space, the space's special power and the space's special reward if you had a good poker hand with its attached cards!).  I little wild west shoot 'em up dice action to round out the theme and further compete for spaces finishes the package.  A solid entry in the Tiny Epic line and while I don't feel an overwhelming urge to go out and buy the game I wouldn't turn down a chance to play again.

If you want a good 'cowboy' game: 
-Doomtown : how to make poker work in a tactical/strategic game
-Carson city : how to make workers, strategy and dice work together in a game
-Bang the dice game : how to make a small game with different character powers work

These 3 games succeed where Tiny Epic Western fails.

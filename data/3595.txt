An interesting alternative to Pictionary.  Is funner for people who like to and are able figure out how to work with the various cards, but (kind of similar to Creationary) can feel too restrictive or hard for those who can't.  Still, I found the word choices on what to make/ guess a whole lot easier to create for and games of this go just as fast as ones for Pictionary do (Creationary takes a bit more time).  Overall a nice little portable party game.

I really like this one, except the word cards are very imbalanced - sometimes the 3-point word is way easier than the 2-point word, and the 1-point word is sometimes quite difficult.  I realize there&#039;s a certain amount of subjectivity to this, but, honestly... I&#039;ve seen some cards where the whole table is baffled by how its three words are &#039;ranked.&quot;

Simultaneous play.  Great for 4+ people, maybe 10 max.  Similar to Pictionary, but you have to make your picture out of cards with pre-drawn shapes on them.  So there is an extra level of imagination and the cards can also be animated to a degree.  We typically use this as a fun filler for game nights while waiting for more people to arrive

An interesting premise, but in the end I can't help but feel like it is more fun to be either acting out clues (e.g., Charades, Time's Up), drawing them (e.g., Pictionary), or even sculpting them (Cranium, Barbarossa). What it has in novelty, it lacks in overall enjoyment.

Its a fairly mindless little social game. It was fun, but like most games in that genre, you can't really play it competitively. Its an activity more than a game.

I enjoyed myself, but I think the novelty would wear off pretty quickly. I wouldn't mind playing again, but I definitely don't need to own a copy and would be a little annoyed if it were suggested often.

I really liked it, but it's a hard game, if you don't have the eye of an artist. 1/2 my family is fantastic at it, they have an eye for using the shapes given to create. The other 1/2 looks sad while trying to guess. I would still recomend it though.

Party game - Already-drawn-segments-on-cards-for-you version of Pictionary.  Good game,  PROVIDED you double the amount of time (the sandtimer needs to be turned over a second time before your turn runs out).  There&#039;s simply not enough time to find all the right cards and put them together if you just allow the sandclock to be turned over once.

RATING: 5
[Resident copy] Entertaining party game - requires some table space to spread out all the bits. The die-based mechanic for choosing easy / medium / hard doesn't seem to add a lot (other than keeping people from always going for 2-3 points) but does occasionally hurt people by only permitting them to try for 1 point.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Components: Sturdy tiles with a variety of shapes; functional topic cards; nice little green chips; a sand timer; and easy to understand rules: very nice production.

Experience: The two things I enjoy most about this game are 1) that everyone but the active player gets to guess each turn, so everyone is always involved, and 2) the pre-printed tiles decrease the handicap for not being artistic, as it becomes a challenge to piece the tiles together into a recognizable picture, rather than conjure one from the air.

As a variant, I recommend eliminating the die, and allowing the active player to decide which difficulty of picture to construct (like in Guesstures), which then adds an element of risk for those who like risk, but allow people to construct the easy ones if the more difficult seem unreasonably hard. I find that the numbers on the cards aren't always well matched with their corresponding words.

The first time I brought it out no one "got it" or wanted to play. The second group of people enjoyed this challenge of creativity and speed and we had a good time.

Fun, Pictionary-like party game.  Several dozen cards with different line patterns on them are spread around the table.  A player rolls a dice (1-3) and must use the patterns to &quot;draw&quot; the corresponding clue on the card.  If it&#039;s guessed in the allotted time, those 1-3 points go to the guesser and the drawing player.  We struggled early, as some of the clues are quite difficult, but we ended up getting quite good at this!  I like it.

RATING: 5
A great idea with sub optimal execution, Squint attempts to take a foothold in the fun and quick party-esque game genre.  The point distribution for items seems random as some objects rated as a 1 are impossible while other 3's are easy.  Of course some are just plain impossible to begin with (tape dispenser?  Are you serious?!).  It's fun for a micro second and OK for the rest, so I would say there's nothing really exceptional here to get flustered over.

Luckily, a couple of games is all it takes to get up to speed.

%u201CSquint%u201D is a fun party game that is pretty much %u201CPictionary%u201D without all the drawing. The box comes with a slew of square cards with various patterns on it. The person giving the clues must use these cards and arrange them in such a way as to get the other players to guess the word. A correct guess within the allotted time from another player earns the player and person giving the clue points.

A very simple game that plays fast. Might be good for people who think they are non-artist types or those who aren%u2019t confident about their drawing skills and therefore shy away from games like %u201CPictionary.%u201D Arranging the cards to form pictures do take a little practice (especially with the time pressure) but it%u2019s a fun concept and a good filler or party type game if you%u2019re looking for a substitute for %u201CPictionary%u201D type games.

The one time I played this game was a blast. A lot of it had to do with good company (John Kovalic, Steve Jackson, and Dan Smith) and the location (late night after a GTS day) but the gameplay with simple and encouraged table talk. I really need to buy myself a copy.

In this party game, you read an object off of a card, and then have 30 seconds to "construct" that object out of a number of tiles on the table that have differently-shaped lines on them.  If someone else guesses what you're trying to make, both you and they get points.  I didn't like this game much, I found it to be fairly frustrating.

Good party / "description" game - fun twist on the old classic Pictionary.  Good side rules of being allowed to say "hot" or "cold" and also being able to animate the creation on the table - those both help move gameplay along.

It's like pictionary, only you don't draw to make the pictures - you use a bunch of tiles with various shapes on them, combined together to make a picture. You (when it's your turn to create the pic) and the person who guesses what the picture is correctly both score points based on the difficulty level (you roll a dice and get a number between 1 and 3, 3 being hardest, worth 3, and you make the picture on the card based on the roll, each card has 3 possible pictures) - if no one guesses what you were making in the picture, then no one scores points. It's a fun, party game, best for the end of the night, so everyone leaves in a chatty mood.

Using any combination of the 72 cards with various shapes on them (such as a cross, various sized circles, wavy lines, etc...), players take turns trying to convey one of the words on a "squint" card. The words have varying degrees of difficulty, from one to three points. Any of the non-building players can guess what the word is. If a player guesses the word before the timer runs out, both the "builder" and guesser receive points.

Fun for playing with kids/adults.  recommended.

Can be hard at first. Children will "get" it better than you would think. My 4 year old niece walked in the room while we were playing and took one look at my design and said "Oooh, a necklace!"...which was correct. Everyone else had been studying in confusion before she walked in. Take it for what it is worth. Best advice....don't use the timer for a couple of times playing it.

Party type game.  Game is playable with more than the recommended 3-8 players, and it was still fun.  Similar to pictionary, but more difficult.

Nice idea, could also be adapted to work in teams trying to do as many as possible within the time.

We've tried splitting into teams, with one person making the artwork, and the rest of the team guessing.  If they're correct, they get the points.  This seemed to work OK, though the original game was better if you had the right number of players.

A hybrid of a jigsaw puzzle and Pictionary. You need to play a few times to become familiar with the pieces, and it's a bit of a free-for-all since it's not played in teams. Fun for a couple of games as a filler.

Alias with pre-drawn pictures, which doesn't require teams and everyone participates. Up to 8 people are officially supported, but theoretically there is no limit. Unlike both original Alias or the draw-your-own-picture "Pictionary", you don't have to be saddled with a lousy team-mate while watching another mind-reading couple dash ahead. Neither do you need an even number of people (starting from 4) to play. Although I generally like Alias-style games, those two aspects I find the worst, but luckily Squint does away with them and retains only the best, thus making this my favorite Alias-style game.

Squint is a fun party game, but it really takes the right kind of group to appreciate it.  When I played it, one person from the group just didn't get the spatial relationships of the cards, and just lacked the creativity to properly convey the depictions.

RATING: 6
This is a party game where one player has to get the rest to guess a word by "building" a picture using an assortment of basic shapes and lines.

Going in I thought the idea was neat but expected it to fall very short of its potential.  Much in the same way I think Fauxcabulary is a neat idea but the game disappointed.  And I thought this one would disappoint for the same reasons, not enough content to fully utilize that neat idea.

I was pleasantly surprised by how well the group was able to make pretty much any word using the collection of cards this game provides.  In my first play we went around a table of four 3 times without a single missed guess.

I think this is a better activity than game, mostly because the simple "builder and correct guesser get a point" scoring doesn't really work in my opinion.  It can cause runaway leaders and often many people will figure out the word at around the same time but the faster or louder one to shout out their answer gets the point.  While I did enjoy and think it is a fine game I also don't really want a large dose of it.  3 times around the table was about enough for me but I would play it again (but only for about as long).

[Out of the Box 2002 edition] {Party; creativity, drawing, deduction} Squint is a hilarious party game and it needs plenty of creativity! One can also learn vocabulary in this game!  Squint has a very strong player interaction. It's very suitable for families and children. However, it may only rock with a suitable game group. Recommended. 

Squint has a strong English barrier. It needs a dictionary to play.

Something is awry here. There's neither time nor incentive to create something interesting! Why bother when you can just point at simple shape X and simple shape Y and get people to blather out enough answers to stick?

I dunno. Maybe I had wrong expectations, but I expected more of a creative process and less of a frantic, manic shout-out-anything-that-comes-to-mind zaniness.

This game is like Pictionary for people who can't draw. Parts of the pictures are pre-drawn for you...you just put them together to form the picture. It's fun to mess around with but game play kinda bites. You just can't find the right tiles to make the picture you want..it's not nearly as flexible game-play-wise as Pictionary so it really doesn't work as a game.

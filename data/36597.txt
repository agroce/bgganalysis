Lots of fun fleet action - especially when cards are used. Wouldn't bother with the ship duels, they are a bit of a bore, but the larger fleet actions are awesome. Haven't played yet its big brother (Flying colors).

Excellent game; I am huge fan of the Age of Sail and I am enjoying the ease of play and not having to worry about the minutea of some of the other games of the genre. 

Also, I recommend checking out the demo's of the game on GMT's website; I found them informative and entertaining.

This expansion to the excellent Flying Colors takes the system into battles around North America, and has increased emphasis on fleets of small ships. Like ridiculously small ships (by European standards) --- Battle of Lake Erie of Put-in-Bay was fought by a fleet of basically gunboats quick built on the shoreline. Lots of fun, and very interesting for those who already enjoy the first game. Lots of period flavor

Not a bad follow up.  Lots of frigates and smaller ships to play with.  Good scenarios.

The card system is a bit gamey and not clear at first.

Though there is a duel mode, which is welcome, this game system works far better for fleet actions.

I didn't enjoy it so much as first volume of series. I do miss big ships. I was also hoping that card deck would add significantly to smaller duels but it was not case. Instead game was even more random. 

So if I want to play Flying Colours system I would rather play first game and if I want smaller scenario I want to give spin to Close Action.

Usually I prefer big sea battles with many players above duels. Initially I didn't buy this game because of that. But it turns out that using the new cards with the game removes the "we are only sailing circles around each other" factor from the ship duels and making it fun!

This is an excellent stand alone expansion of the Flying Colors system. The system adds a new nation, expands on the existing nation and tidies up the odd kink found in the original game of the series. To my mind this package offers three things over the original volume:

1. There is a ship duel package. Need a FC fix? There are about 40 or so battles to choose from!

2. There is a card deck, to add a little variability to the system. This took some time to grow on me, but it is a nice option

3. Fleet engagement's with minnows! A whole new realm of strategy is required to push these ships. One shot can make a difference!

This offers a faster playing and more compact game than Flying Colors - which focused more on larger map and larger ship duels that needed multiple sessions to complete. With this package the action starts faster and concludes quicker, with games (both duels and the fleet actions) able to be completed in a single session.

I eagerly await the next volume!

Very nice game.  I enjoyed the scenario I played, Lake Ontario.  I have to say, this is a great entry into the system.  Flying Colors may be a bit too much to start. 12/08/2012 [7]

Stand alone game is a great addition to the Flying Colors series. The frigate and gun brig scenarios are very good and even the largest scenarios can be played in a single evening. In addition to new ships and counters, SotS adds optional event cards that can be played with other games in the series. The addition of the duel map with templates hold counters for two ships from each side keeps the game clean. While I miss the big 1.5" counters from the original, this is an excellent game.

Volume II of Flying Colors series...looks at smaller ships and their battles.  The Duel rules (game card system) is an interesting expansion on the original Flying Colors rules.  Though duels are possible, the heart of the game is still the Fleet Actions.

RATING: 6
Played one small scenario and managed to score an underdog victory. 

Games are a little lengthy, and I'm not sure how 1-1 battles with large numbers of ships will be, but it was great fun, full of agonizing die roll results. Command rules seem the weakest aspect of the game, with the turning issues others have mentioned. With smaller scenarios, not as much of a problem. Also lack of simultaneous movement doesn't help matters.

It is one of the best Naval game I have ever played. I started playing the series with SotS since I was more interested in the American Revolutionary War & the War of 1812 period than Napoleonic. My only trouble with it is the counter clutter of all the small counters. It was the first game that made me want to have a pair of tweezers. I wished there could have been a ship log like Flying Colors so one could have a choice. A very fun game that captures the period.

RATING: 5
This game has substantial feel and appeal with the Duels and Initiative Cards, but I initially had trouble wrapping my head around the system as it is layered and somewhat intricate with its maneuvers.

Charts are numerous, but only just cover the bare bones. I've had to scribble a ton of notes on the play aids just to work through the game.

Listing the rates of ships in the Scenario booklet would have made setup easier. Why wasn't this done?

A bit of counter clutter as well, but optional sheets are available for those who don't mind pencil and paper.

The core rules are solid, a few concessions to playability sure, but in the end just not appealing enough.

Really wanted to like this one. Why oh Why did the designer go with one hex counters????? That alone killed it for me. The whole system was supposed to be based on the rectangular counters like in "Flying Colors". Traded it away mint, unpunched.

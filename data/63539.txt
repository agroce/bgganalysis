RATING: 4.5
Lupus in Tabula is just yet another take on the classic Werewolf game. Someone might still love it, while someone thinks it's outdated at this point. I personally really don't understand why this game is still so popular.

To be honest, I'm not a fan of social deduction games to begin with. Especially when that game doesn't have a real mechanism to base your lying/deduction on. Unfortunately this is the case most of the times, at least in my opinion, and it's also true about Lupus in Tabula. Now, the game is not really bad. I get that it's easy to learn, fast to play and that it can accommodate a small crowd. Yet I find its game-play pretty shallow and I seriously don't see how a game could be considered good, when by its very nature one player won't play at all during the whole thing.

Furthermore there has been such a huge stream of new titles in this genre, that it starts to be hard for this game to keep up and stay relevant. I guess the one luck that this title has is its old fan-base. Otherwise I don't think Lupus in Tabula would be able to stand out, being so similar to so many other games on the market today. Not bad, but definitively mediocre.

Werewolf : the ugly as sin edition (I have the old version). Seriously that artwork is an eyesore.

To top it off, my version also suffers a bad case of misprinting.

But oh well, Werewolf's still fun in it's own right.

Werewolf/Mafia
This will actually fluctuate in my rating depending on who the others involved would be, and how many there would be. I believe that without at least 10 there isn't enough time to come to conclusions and play effectively.
With the right group it's at least an 8, but probably not a 9. With the wrong group it would be no better than a 5.

The number of, and specific, roles will also impact enjoyment.

In the nearly genre-wide field of games like this, Lupus in Tabula is my least favorite. It gets a 5 because the Mafia/Werewolf genre is still fun, but this one is plagued by less than optimum card art and too many - yes, too many characters to play. 

Personal preference leans me to Werewolves of Miller's Hollow as the quintessential Werewolf game, but if you love having more characters then Lupus in Tabula is the version for you.

However, know that the card art is difficult to see from across the room, and so differentiating between the characters (other than wolves) sometimes requires a double-take.

My main complaint about this version of Werewolf (aka Mafia) is that one must always remind new players that they may not mention the art on the cards. The villager cards have unique art on each and this can lead to an unfair game against the wolves.

This version does have on of the better methods of conducting moderation duties of those in print, but it's still not great.

RATING: 8.5
Expanded edition of the classic [gameid=925], originally created by the Russian Davidoff in 1986, and given a Werewolf theme by Andrew Plotkin in 1997.  A great role-playing party game.  Can be played with regular playing cards, where it's also played under the name "Mafia".  Drawback: player elimination.  

Davidoff: "The uninformed majority against the informed minority."

Previously I owned the simpler Looney Labs edition, which just has basic roles: Villagers, Werewolves, Seer.  Now I own the (first) "Lupus in Tabula" edition, which (like "The Werewolves of Millers Hollow" and "Ultimate Werewolf" - see this [geeklist=70855]geeklist[/geeklist] for an overview of commercial editions) has fun additional character roles.  Contains:
● 3 werewolves
● 13 humans (12 villagers, 1 seer)
● 8 special characters (e.g. bodyguard), for 9+ player games
● 26 angry mob cards (for voting)
● summary & blank cards
Also own: [gameid=104872] from Spielbox

Comment from someone on the rule system of Lupus in Tabula edition:
[q]Lupus has a more structured voting system: Everyone nominates; there is then a vote between the two who got the most nominations. This can take a little longer (to collect the nominations) but cuts down on the chaos and avoids serial acquittals, perhaps more valuable in larger groups. There is a Role (the 'Owl' in the English translation) that depends on the two-nominee mechanism.  It also has a no-reveal rule, and a Role (the Medium) who learns whether the villagers lynched a werewolf or not. I rather like the rule system, although Ultimate has a better presentation.[/q]

Rule questions I have:
● do you reveal character after being lynched? (my guess: yes, contra Lupus in Tabula rules) ([thread=547181]discussion[/thread] and [thread=340519]poll[/thread])
● how does voting work? (nomination system, or just majority pointing? I think: discussion, nomination/seconder, defence speech, majority vote, new nomination) [Ultimate Werewolf has great rulebook about this.]  Ideas about voting [thread=271775]here[/thread] and [thread=161725]here[/thread].  Problem with nomination system is that people can lynch first person nominated to stay alive; problem with more complex Lupus in Tabula voting system is it's a bit hard to resolve.  Lupus has two stage system ([thread=1063797]here[/thread] and [thread=163507]here[/thread]), Miller's Hollow just has pointing and the most votes is lynched, most others seem to use the nomination/seconder/defence/vote system, as argued well as Method 4 in [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/8223409#8223409]this great post with five voting methods plus pros/cons[/url] (also defended by [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/13899000#13899000]Ted Alspach[/url] and [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/13881001#13881001]used at BGG CON[/url]
● to ensure balance, how many villagers per werewolves/special characters etc?  [Ultimate Werewolf gives cards point values to help with this]
● should werewolves devour someone on first round? (my guess: yes with odd number of players including moderator, unless there's an even number of players including moderator then they devour mod, because you want an odd number of active players alive during the day - although I need to experiment with this, depends also on voting methods so it doesn't seem essential) (see [thread=91094]discussion[/thread] and [thread=116351]discussion[/thread] and see Plotkin's comments below)
● should you lynch someone on the first round?  Absolutely, otherwise you help the wolves
● is lynching mandatory? (some say making it optional - eg if tied vote, or players can't agree - makes the game more fun, you get more info by waiting till wolves attack again, but you also take more pain.  Allowing a no-lynch may actually help the wolves.)
● when does game end? (either when one team is entirely eliminated, or when werewolves equal villagers, coz villagers can't win?)
● does the accused vote? Ted Alspach did when teaching once ([thread=891332]here[/thread])
● what happens with tied votes for lynching? [thread=841088]discussion[/thread] and [thread=94614]discussion[/thread]
● may the dead make a final speech? No, only when accused, but not after being lynched and voted out

For balance, a [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_%28party_game%29#Game_experience_and_strategy]mathematical study[/url] concluded that (with no special roles) the initial number of mafiosi need to be proportional to the square root of the total number of players.  See this [thread=81173]guide[/thread] to balancing number of characters (automated [url=http://www.thecassandraproject.org/jeremy/werewolf/balance]here[/url]), although some think more wolves are needed, i.e. 1 wolf for every 5 players.  A [thread=538785]poll[/thread] assuming 1 seer suggests 2 wolves for 11-13 players (some do 3 for 13 players), 3 wolves for 14-17 players, 4 wolves for 18+ players.

Andrew Plotkin: "There are several reasons to have an odd number of players (including the moderator): There will be an odd number of living players during each day, which prevents tie votes on lynchings; and the game will always end with a lynching. If there are an even number of players, you can get ties, and the game will end with a nighttime murder -- which is anticlimactic, because everyone knows when the sun goes down that the game will end at dawn. (Because the werewolves are certain to kill a human and win.)"
"If the number of players is even, you start with a night but don't let the werewolves attack that first night. This keeps the parity normal."

I love to play Lupus in Tabula (and its many variants) in any setting, and I find even funnier to be the game master. Maybe I find the graphic design of the cards a bit too childish  for my taste (I prefer, for example, the style of the cards of The Werewolves of Miller's Hollow). Anyway: great party game!

Evoluzione di Werewolf con alcune correzioni come la non esclusione dal gioco dei morti/fantasmi che potranno continuare a votare. Il gioco è un simpatico party game che, con la giusta compagnia, regala serate molto divertenti. Il gioco ha il grande vantaggio di poter esser giocato anche in gruppi particolarmente grossi (fino a 24/30 giocatori a seconda delle versioni) con l'inserimento di personaggi con poteri speciali (è carino inserire i personaggi speciali anche in pochi). La versione senza moderatore permette di non escludere nessuno dal gioco ma è più complessa da gestire e alcuni personaggi non possono essere utilizzati.

Same comments as Werewold. It's nothing but role playing and meta gaming, generally ganging up on people just because they don't do it well, none of which is up my alley. It proves a decent excuse however to formally drop all conventions of civilised behaviour and succumb to the fun of mindless mob hysteria and lynchings!

When the opportunity arrived that 10 people were available, I was reluctant to introduce this game, as I feared it would be so dependent on group dynamics that the experience may fall flat.

So long as players can implement tactical "Survivor" style arguments and counter arguments of why someone should be killed and not killed, and the moderator can provoke such styles in players and maintain pace and atmosphere, this game is an interesting mature psychological experience of lies and persuasion.

My hesitation was due to lack-lustre experiences with The Big Idea and Once Upon A Time, but in Lupus in Tabula, you're less dependent on being creative to be funny, and more in persuasion. Thers is some confusion as to how the roles work, and I think in future I won't allow a killing on the first night to prevent a totally random murder and give everyone a chance at discussing and lynching, which may favour the villagers too much. I'll have to see.

I can see other 'geeks arguments that there are no real clues as to who is who, and hence no real game, but I suspect more competitive 'werewolves' would give more body language/verbal clues. All in all, I've been bitten with the desire to play more games.

I'm sure with a good group it can be funny and enjoyable (but which game isn't?), though the game itself needs some improvement. I don't like blind accusation.. I mean most of the times you have no idea how to vote, there is just not enough information, especially if you don't have any special power. Also it would be better if the ghosts and simple villagers could do something more, because for them the gameplay is much more dull.

If you have a large crowd, this is one of the best party games out there.

My Werewolf published deck preference (and my own copy of the game) is: daVinci's/Mayfair's 'Lupus in Tabula'.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
[daVinci Game 'Lupus in Tabula' 2004 edition] {Party; secret identity, partnership, player elimination, voting} A funny party game with excellent player interaction. Highly chaotic but loads of fun and noises. It is equally hilarious when either the werewolves or villagers win. To have a successful play, there shall be a smart moderator and all 'eliminated' players keep silent.

I am thinking its replay value for the same group of friends. When most players are becoming familiar with all altitudes and behaviors of the players. It may become easier to find out who are the werewolves.

[New edition] The new edition is more pretty; however, the price is too much for such a small game.  I am glad that I have the old edition.

Classic social deduction game. Marred by long downtime for eliminated players and a lack of information. I really enjoy the art and extra card choices of the Lupus in Tabula set. (It's got a Werehamster - how can you top that?)

It is cool to have a game that can play up to 24 people so well.

There is no reason not to own some version of Werewolf. I like this one, because the art is playful (better for kids), it's small and it's cheap.




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 5
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 5
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 5
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 5

the only problem with this game is that is too much dependant with the people you're playing with.

Divertente party game, con il grande difetto di di dovere essere giocato veramente in molti e che chi purtroppo esce dal gioco si diverte ben poco.

Funny social game with the right people (and I mean a LOT of people).
The problem is that on many casual gathering evenings, once the group starts playing they often want to keep playing it over and over.

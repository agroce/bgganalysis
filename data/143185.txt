GAME: Smash Up: The Obligatory Cthulhu Set

While I love Cthulhu and the Lovecraft mythos, this expansion fell a bit flat for me. It doesn't seem to play well with the rest of the sets.

RATING: 5
What can I say? Most people dislike this expansion because it doesn't integrate well. Personally, I'm a fan. Really though, it's worth it for Minions of Cthulu and Elder Things expansion. Elder Things are shockingly annoying and fun to play. Overall, this is an expansion that has more synergy within/among itself than with other factions, which is a shame. But still, it's SmashUp!

Was a little underwhelmed by the theme (I wanted a 'horror' themed expansion but not have it be all about Lovecraft), but still found interplay between the new factions to be pretty fun (Zombies + Innsmouth and Ghosts + Miskatonic University). The addition of the madness deck is pretty good too as it gives players a new venue for manipulation.

I enjoy this expansion, but it definitely seems to be more balanced mechanically when everyone is playing with one of these factions in their decks. Also I'm not sure I love how they divided up the four groups, though mechanically at least they all feel distinct.

See Smash Up

A tremendous amount of reviews claim that this expansion is not fun unless everyone else is playing with a faction from this set.  The logic behind this claim is that the Madness mechanism must be found in every player's deck.  This is absurd and untrue.

Most people point out that Madness is hard to get rid of for non-Cthulhu factions.  The truth is, Madness is hard to get rid of for ALL factions, even for the Cthulhu factions.  No matter which faction you are, you must use an action to permanently discard a Madness.  The only factions that have an easy time getting rid of Madness are factions that get bonus actions.  If you don't like Madness, I understand why you wouldn't buy/play with Cthulhu, but it's not a question of balance.

Please note that only 3 of the Cthulhu factions use Madness - the faction Innsmouth does not use Madness except on one action card.  Of the three that use Madness, one faction almost exclusively gives Madness to other players (Elder Things), another faction almost exclusively takes Madness for itself (Minions of Cthulhu), and the third faction gains and loses Madness in order to power actions (Miskatonic University).  

One combo of these decks has synergy if both are in your hand - Miskatonic University (MU) and Minions of Cthulhu - since you may be able to gain more Madness than usual and thus power your MU actions better than usual.

There is also an instance of one set countering another - MU does well against ET for the same reason it does well in combo with MoC.  MoC allows you to bring used Madness back to your hand to be permanently discarded later, but there are several factions that have an ability like this (Time Travelers, Dragons, Steampunks, Zombies, etc.) so it isn't really a Cthulhu-specific advantage.

Outside of these combos, all four factions from this set can be played with or against any other factions from any other set without any Cthulhu- or Madness-specific advantage/disadvantage.  

This is different from the Munchkin set, because a few of the Munchkin factions are stronger when there are other Munchkin factions in play and when there are more Munchkin.  For these factions (Dwarves, Thieves, Warriors), playing with too many non-Munchkin bases makes them unplayable.  With Cthulhu, there is little or no advantage/disadvantage of playing with too many or too few Cthulhu factions or bases.  Unlike Munchkin factions, you can mix Cthulhu factions into a game the same way you would mix factions from Pretty Pretty, Monster Smash, etc.  Just be sure to keep the Madness deck on hand.

So to recap, if someone picks Elder Things, you should pick Miskatonic University.  Otherwise, feel free to mix these into your set just like you mix the others.  (I keep my Munchkin factions separate in my Big Geeky Box, but my Cthulhu are mixed in alphabetically like the others.)

RATING: 7
This expansion improves on the game because it adds a new factor (Madness cards) that add a new strategic element to the game. However, it doesn't work as well as other expansions because of this: If you are playing with one Cthulhu faction, everyone needs a Cthulhu faction, because they have to be able to deal with the Madness cards. So, you can't just pick oen faction and mix it in with robot kittens and dinosaur pirates. Either you forego the Cthulhu expansion, or you play a game whose flavor is dominated by this Cthulhu expansion.

This was an exceptionally disappointing expansion in my opinion. The addition of the "Madness" mechanic doesn't mix well with any other Smash-Up theme. This is more of a 2 person mini-spinoff rather than something I will ever mix in with the rest of the expansions/base set. I was quite excited about this since I love (mostly) everything Cthulu, but sadly it adds a dimension that the other factions do not account for.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I like Cthulhu themes!

Minions of the Cthulhu is my favorite faction to date!

A lot of people say that this expansion is only good if all people a the table plays with Cthulhu factions (because of madness). It is not true. These factions blends well in games, where some people do not have Cthulhu decks.
 
The factions, that use madness balance madness out in themselves. Risk/reward.

I will say that the Elder Thing factions is a God Tier Faction (like Robots or Zombies) due the the obscene amount of Madness cards it gives other players.

The rest of the Factions are fun and balanced with Innsmouth maybe being a little weaker than most ofher faction.

SO!! Great Expansion and despite what others say, these factions plays well in games where not all people use Cthulhu, except for Elder Things, which are a God-Tier Faction.

LOVE THE GAME!!

Another very good expansion for Smash Up.  The "madness" cards are ok, something different, but sometimes we purposely avoid the decks that have them.  

On the other hand, the Innsmouth locals deck is easily one of my favorites in all of the expansions.  

My kid loves the Elder thingies, or whatever they're called.  He beats me regularly with them. 

Definitely a necessary expansion.

While a big Cthulhu fan I didn't like the addition of the madness mechanic to the game. One of the things I liked about Smash-up was the relative simplicity of the game at face value. I've had to explain and re-explain how people can use madness cards, where they go when used, etc... And they're not as much fun unless at least one other person is working off their mechanics. I hope not to see more of the same in their future expansions.

The madness cards are a bit ridiculous if you don't realize that many of the decks have no way to really get rid of them if you're taking a lot of cards.  Even ending up with 4 of them in your deck at the end of a round after wasting time putting them back in the madness deck is a kick in the teeth.  Maybe it gets better with more plays so you know what to watch for when people are drafting decks.

This is my least favorite expansion. It does not mix well with the base set or the other expansions. It adds another mechanic that no other set can really get around so if you want to mess with someone you can pick decks out of this expansion and try to mess with your opponents. There are some powerful minions in this one, but the madness cards do not mesh well with any of the other expansions.

This expansion does not mix well with the other sets. It seems as though it was meant to be a standalone game. My experience is that the player who selects the Elder Gods wins because of the high power rating on three of their cards, which also have abilities. They are very unbalanced, but I suppose that was the point because they are the Elder Gods...

I'm not a big H.P. Lovecraft fan so that's why this doesn't rank that high on my list. The gameplay itself is very innovative. This expansion introduces a new element to the game called, "Madness." It is a penalty card that is worth -1 point at the end of the game. The four new factions are what deal these terrible awful cards out. The new factions are actually very well done (except the Locals). The faction that makes fun of Scooby-Doo is hilarious!

I'm not a huge Cthulhu fan so maybe I'm not the target audience here. I got the set. I enjoy the set. ...but it feels out of place in this game. The theme doesn't mesh. At game nights, there are often requests for "no madness" (no Cthulhu) as well, so these decks don't see nearly as much play as others in the game.

The set is fun and novel, but I feel that I wouldn't have missed it either.

Good set but when playing against other sets Madness seems to always win out as there's no real ways of using it outside the set or easily getting rid of it. Plays best within itself as there's many options to handle madness but when mixed into other decks the madness sometimes makes it impossible for others to win since even if they do hit the VP limit to end the game the madness brings them down.

these cards only work within the expansion, only play as long as each person has at least one from this set. Otherwise It feels broken to me.The madness works within the expansion, but isn't fun if people can fight back with madness as well.

Baffled by the theme. Very hard to get excited about 4 variations of Cthulhu races. Difficult to keep the factions mentally distinct. There were so many other ways to go for a 2nd or 3rd expansion - perhaps this would more understandable as a 7th or 8th expansion.

Smash Up: The Obligatory Cthulhu Set features crazy Cthulhu cultists, fishy Innsmouth locals, horrifying Elder Things, and good old Miskatonic University members (the Fightin' Cephalopods). To be certain we got it right, this set also includes a new card type fittingly known as "Madness" that each of these groups can use to various effects. Just remember that Madness brings you power but at a price (joking!).

RATING: 1
OK -- I admit to only having glanced through the detailed threads here about whether or not the madness giving is balanced or not. For the record, whether or not it's balanced the majority of my group perceived it being imbalanced; and that's where my mindset is too.


My real problem with the madness cards is more one of theme. Smash Up is a great generic meme game -- my Zombie Wizards against your Ninja Pirates. Not any particular pirates or wizards, but generic ones. 


The Cthulu set overturns that applecart with very specifically themed decks to one particular fiction story. 

Also the madness cards, especially in the context of giving them to other players, is very much contrary to the theme of Smash Up. It dilutes other people's decks with someone else's theme. If I want to play my Fairy Super-Spies or Time Traveling Steampunks, I don't want your Cthulu madness theme sullying my deck's theme. It's out of place. I don't put pixie dust cards or steampunk referenced cards into your deck, stay the &$%*&%! out of my deck!


Another way to look at it; instead of my two twenty card memes against your two twenty card memes -- a cthulu player now has his 40 card deck + these madness cards up their proverbial sleeve. People got shot in the old west for adding cards to the game. Heh! ;-)

I own everything Smash Up published at this point (Pretty Pretty being the most recently released). I highly recommend it all. Except this one. Avoid it.

This was a bright shiny thing that I bought when I first got really into boardgaming, and I appreciate the role that it served. But now that my horizons have broadened, I'm not sure I ever see myself playing Smash Up again. People that know their decks strengths and how they fit together will always have an advantage, and there can be too much kingmaking.

I like the ideas here, but unlike Power Level these factions seem best mixed only with each other to get the best effect. It was gratifying to see that the Madness cards didn't ruin the flow or play time, and I do like the new locations.

New opinion: When I figured out how to use the three out of the four factions, I think this is a decent expansion, really. But Innsmouth is a comlete brainfrt in my opinion. It doesn't stack with any other deck in any reasonable way, and you just fly through your deck and watch as the cards from your combining faction goes to the boottom of your deck, well knowning that all of your actions that might stack with Innsmouth goes the bottom of the ocean..

madness cards suck. if ANYBODY uses a faction from this set, EVERYBODY has to use a faction from this set. Madness cards each deal -1 pt to other players that cannot easily counter these cards. These factions change the feel of the game from a friendly slapping contest to a surprise kick to the crotch. I have this expansion because I love all the others and didn't know better, but I will likely never play with these factions again :(

Only reason this expansion does not get a 10 is because some of the factions are dependent on there being tons of madness cards, but this gets "washed out" by the existence of other factions, so the faction, in my opinion, will never operate at full strength.

I love the Cthulhu mythos and really enjoy this expansion.  The factions are quite unique and offer some interesting mechanics.   I do not believe, however, the factions are as interesting as the Awesome Level 9000 factions.

Adds 4 new factions, plus the Madness mechanic. I still have to see try it more, but I think this Madness mechanic benefits some factions more than others, and the difference is not small.

This set is so unique: a single, common theme for all the factions and a completely - but also common - new mechanic (Madness).

Anyway I like the theme and the four factions are interesting, but I found some minor flaws on the cards, like little errors or ambiguities.
Furthermore the Innsmouth and Minions of Cthulhu appear to me as weak factions, so after many matches I did some tweaks to better balance them.

A good expansion to a great game. I didn't think I would like this one that much, as I'm not a fan of the Lovecraftian craze, but the cards are well done and maintain the faction variety I love about the core game, not to mention one of the factions has a awesome 'Scooby Doo' theme to it, which was a fun surprise.

There's a few downsides to this one, however. For some reason, the new base cards have a different color back, which makes them stand out from the other cards, which really sucks if you're like me and prefer to use clear sleeves. There's also one base in the expansion that in my opinion, gives one of the game's factions a bit too big a boost. Those issues aside, it's still a fun expansion.

I love the concept of Smash Up. Ninja zombies or robot aliens? Sign me up.I also love the art - beautifully illustrated and very thematic.

However I am struggling to love the game itself as I find too many aspects of the game more tedious than fun. The biggest drag by far - the constant reading of text on each card. Not only will you spend a lot of time reading the cards in your hand, everyone needs to read every card played by any other player as well. Plus the need to constantly re-read all the base cards every now and then plus minion cards around bases plus base or minion modifiers on top of them. This is in stark contrast to games like Race for the Galaxy or 7 Wonders, where you just take a quick glance at the iconography on a card and instantly know what it does.

Then comes the constant need to calculate and recalculate the total power of cards around a base or even every single card, if some modifiers happen to be included. I have now printed out some custom basemats with a power track and +1/-1 power tokens for individual cards, which will hopefully mitigate the problem, but without these, the constant book-keeping was sucking out most of the fun from the game.

This expansion is actually even tolerable as a two player game without combining it with the base game or any of the expansions. The "Madness" cards work quite well - do you choose the get a boost from them and risk losing victory points later, or will you keep your distance and purge your deck of them to retain the VPs? The art is beautiful as always, but nothing can change the fact, that a bunch of time is wasted reading and re-reading the text on every damn card in your hand and half the cards on the table. If you know the game well, you can get some enjoyable synergies going, but if your opponent is new to the game, he or she has no chance against you. I generally dislike games, where knowledge of the deck can seriously impact your success in the game and unfortunately "Smash Up" is one of those gamess

ADDS A HORRIBLY COMPLICATED MECHANIC TO THE GAME.

I have only played this expansion as a standalone game so far, I'd expect it to go up in rating when paired with the base game.

Expansion

Why we culled it: It left with the base game. See my more comprehensive comments on the base game entry for details. In general, all of the expansions are fairly similar from the standpoint that if they add a trope that excites you, it is probably worth adding to your collection if you're interested. Mechanically, they do differ and add new things, but they do a good job trying to keep it thematic, so you aren't missing much if the theme of an expansion doesn't grab you.

This particular expansion integrates the worst with the rest of the game, as many of the "Madness" effect/remedies only exist in this faction. A heavy Madness deck against any deck not containing a faction from this set makes for lopsided games. This one is best isolated or carefully planned around.

Much of the fun is in who you play with, which is very much a "for better or worse" statement of fact.

I wish the four factions were less interdependent. As it stands, the new Madness mechanic almost requires each player to have one of the new factions in order to have a balanced game.

An ok addition to smash up, but hard to work with the other expansions, still worth investing in. My favorite faction in this set has to be Elder Things

This expansion is a bit too parasitic for Munchkin. The Madness mechanic is thematic, but doesn't mix well with the rest of Munchkin. I would recommend it only as a stand alone 2p box, and even then, other expansions are probably better for that experience.

RATING: 4
This one is kind of Munchkiny, maybe even more tongue-in-cheek than the usual Smash-up release. There's some interesting combinations in here, but the madness cards kind of clutter up the other decks and give those playing a Cthulhu faction an unfair advantage over those who aren't. I think. Maybe.

I had the impression that this expansion would not add much to the game and didnt think much of it. 

Surprisingly, we find it damn fun! The madness deck really changes the feel of the game. You may think you are in the lead and rush for the finish, but after deducting points, you might not be the winner. PS - writing this after 2 plays. 

So far, small summary of the factions

Innsmouth- faction which focus on swarming with locals [or minions with the same name] as well as returning minions to hand instead of discard pile when scoring. 

Miskatonic University - faction which focus on drawing madness cards and discarding/using them for various effects, [as well as action cards to return madness cards back to the madness deck]

Elder things - Forcing enemies to draw madness cards, then taking various effects to shuffle them into the deck so it would be tougher to get rid of them.

Cthulhu minions - Drawing madness cards for various effects and passing the cards to your opponents as well as reclaiming actions from your discard pile.

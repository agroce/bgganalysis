This game is quite good with 5+.  No matter how good you think you are at shuffling 2 cards under the table and keeping track of them, you WILL fail.  There is nothing better than when a player looks certain of the card the are about to flip and then the horror when it's not what they thought they had.

An interesting bluffing/memory game which requires far too much concentration to qualify as a party game, and is far too chaotic to be strategic. Great artwork though.

RATING: 6
You pretty much lose track of what is going on after a few turns. But I guess that is the whole point. 

The main problem with Mascarade is that it only a few of the characters push the game towards the end, i.e. bring more money into the circulation, while most of the characters just move money from one player to another. Hence, you can have many stagnation rounds.

With the right mind setting and a big group it is still proper fun, though.

A fine game by Bruno Faiduti about bluffing and social deduction. I just don't get a lot of chances to play party games and when I do this one is a little to gamery and not casual enough for laymen players and my gamery friends, were we to play party games, would probably be more inclined to play coup or resistance or werewolf before this one. Traded.

I played this game just three times, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.

Yet another social deduction game. Artwork and components might set this one apart from the others but mechanics-wise there's really nothing new in here, except for some extra dose of Faidutti-style chaos. I know that this is something that some people might actually appreciate... but unfortunately that's not my case.

Social deduction games in general aren't really my cup of tea, especially when the deduction is solely based on your ability to read your opponents' faces. I miss something to base my bluff or my deduction on. I miss mechanisms! It's not a bad game per se, but it's simply not a game for me.

I played with a very large group, and there was a lot of downtime.  Still, large groups are hard to manage and I can see this getting more play.  I think it's superior to Coup

Pros
- Fun concept
- The switching (or not), getting challenged parts are fun
- Plays up to a lot of people

Cons
- Fiddly rules for when the person going next challenges you
- Frustrating when everybody knows exactly what the person has and they keep claiming it, since nobody can challenge them 
- Too many symbols to figure out while trying to see what you can do to win the game
- End game is underwhelming since the winner just gets coins and wins

A secret identity game in which you may quickly not know your own identity.  On your turn you may exchange your character with another player's (or pretend to) or, rather like Coup, declare a character and get some money. Also like Coup, other players can challenge your declaration.  Some scope for bluffing, often you're just guessing.  Mascarade is painless only if over quickly.

A party game with hidden roles. Each character card has a unique ability. Since cards are hidden, you can claim to be any of them, but you can use the ability only if noone challenges you to prove your claim. The game is fun with large numbers of players. Artwork is great.

But, I think that Coup is far better.

An okay bluffing game with the right group. Somewhat entertaining but can only be played a few times as it gets old rather quickly. Beautiful artwork on the cards.

Chaotic, unintentional hilarity is the best way to describe this game. You'll never fully know what's going on and when you accept that and just have fun with it, then it's an amazing game.

Doesn't quite replace Citadels for me, but I really adore how the theme of a masquerade ball is just dripping through this deduction/bluffing game, simple enough for parties and new players but offering a fair share of variation depending your player # and what characters you decide to incorporate into a session. Not to mention, the art is nearly paralleled, breathtaking and sweeps you right into the mood of the mechanics! One of Faidutti's very best.

I love the artwork of this game (though you'll barely look at that during the game). I love the mindgames you get to play during the game, and the types of interaction. What I don't like is how the game ends, with quite a few "sudden death" ending becoming possible around the same time, and the winner being the one who slips through or lucks out, rather than the one who has been playing the game best overall. There's also not enough chaos being introduced during the game; it very swiftly resolves into being forced to swap cards with the next person in line, because otherwise they'll be able to play their card for certain.
My rating for this is dropping rapidly...

The initial chaos is hilarious when cards get swapped (or not) and cause a lot of confusion. However, after everyone took a turn and current players got challenged several times, it starts to fall apart a little as you most likely know which character you have. It's then up to you to swap and keep up the vibe instead of using your characters ability and go towards winning.

I'm astounded at how good this game is. No other game plays a large amounts of people better. Love it. It is the best  introductory game I own.  Though it is not my favorite game, it may be the game that I play the most. I am tired of most of the other more basic gateway games I own, but I never get sick of this one. I would recommend the expansion.   It had some fantastic characters and doubles the variability.   I feel that few collections would be complete without this game.

I kind of like this game, but it feels like something is missing.

The game works best if all the players are not only trying to win but also trying to prevent others from winning. Too often someone gets to use their ability more than once in the row because no one wanted to switch their card for that one.

RATING: 7
I was quite excited to get this game from my brother because I heard a number of good things about it. Upon playing it I found that it was indeed a quick light game that involved a little bluff and some fun role selection. The mix of powers looks very interesting, but I have only played with the suggested set for 4 players so far. I'm a bit concerned that 4 may not be the ideal number for this game and it might demand a larger group to really shine, but I still had fun. I think one of the issues I noticed was that swapping often felt like the sucker's move because no one really wanted to pass up a turn of using their ability, but eventually someone would have to bite the bullet and take the hit of swapping to slow down whoever had the King. This, of course, was merely an early impression and future plays might change my tune. Because Mascarade is light and quick I imagine I'll play it a number of times in order to decide if I love it or merely like it. For now I'm somewhat undecided.

In my experience, this game is quite a bit better than the other very simple, short, card party games that have come out recently.  Love Letter and Coup are okay, but seem to get old fast.  I see the potential for Mascarade to have more lasting power.  There is opportunity to set up to create a different experience each time and it feels like there are more, real decisions in this one.

Playing this with 7 people was terrible.  We all knew everything and everyone knew what to do on every turn.  The second-guessing wasn't there.  I'm no longer interested in this game.

Mascarade feels like a dumbed-down Citadels: that is, it’s way less strategic, more complex and less fun than the latter. [i](April 2014)[/i]

If I ever get forced to play this again rating is likely to drop to a 1. Bluffing/memory game (although the game element is rather lacking), not helped by woeful tiny play aids to remind you which powers are in the game.

Plays a crowd easily, and I'm always able to introduce this game to new players with good results. The only caveat is that you need to explain the importance of switching cards ahead of time as well as calling others out (and showing that the penalty isn't terrible), otherwise no one will do anything other than use their power and the best power wins.

I am not sure if we missed something. Played with 5 and didn't quite get the thrill. People didn't shuffle characters enough to put someone out. Everyone knew who the other was, so it was pointless. You know player x is the king, so who is gonna call him out on it? Even if someone swaps, it's was worth him calling king again, and now we know who is the king. Just think I missed something...

Fantastic hidden role, deduction card game. 

The silly 'swap or not' mechanic provides some absolutely hilarious moments where you are 100% sure you or person A has a card, only to find out it's on the other side of the table and you have NO IDEA HOW IT GOT THERE!

The art and production value is fantastic also.

The only issue with Mascarade is that it can be difficult for people to 'get.' IF they get it it's amazing, but if they don't it can fall flat.

When this first came out it was often compared to "Love Letter," but IMO the two games could not be more different. Love Letter's beauty is that the tiny amount of deduction involved is only there to guide decisions that are still basically grounded in chance. This game pretends to be more of a "deduction" game, when it is actually far more chaotic and unpredictable than Love Letter, and lasts much longer between turns. The two player "variant" is also a nightmare and never should have been included in the box.

I'm beginning to discover that I'm not the biggest Faidutti fan...

Much better than I thought it would be.  A bit random at times but the bluffing (via a swap or not mechanic) is genius and provides for a very fun experience.  

After 9 plays - this game continues to grow on me.  I've now played with many different group sizes and different players and it just delivers every time.  My regular group keeps coming back to this and we can't stop playing.  At the moment this is my top game of 2013.

The tension in this game is who am I? To play always knowing specifically who you are slows you down too much, but stating the wrong role, simply helps out someone else.

RATING: 8
Holy crap! This game hurts the brain. So much. If you like a game every once in awhile that makes your brain feel like it's been PHYSICALLY DAMAGED then this is the game for you.

This is a lot more chaotic than most bluffing games I've tried, but it's actually pretty fun. It's hard to put into words what makes this game enjoyable... knowing you can screw up everyone else's careful tracking so much just with ONE bluff makes you feel like an evil genius. And it feels great to be right.

The roles all work together well and in interesting ways. It's a bit overwhelming at first to remember what all the roles do, but the first time you're right about who has what you feel pretty damn great. And it's nice that that's really the ONLY thing you have to learn/remember, the actual rules are straightforward as can be.

There are a lot of games in this genre, but Mascarade really stands apart. For the group that can embrace it, there is SO much chaos and SO much hilarious uncertainty that it at times feels like it borders on an artistic statement about the futility and, from human perspective, randomness of an uncaring universe.

Fast-paced deduction/bluffing game a la Love Letter with a bit more meat on its bones and a greater scope for large player counts but lacking Love Letter's pick-up-and-play breeziness. Like most fillers, primarily enjoyable as a filibuster before sitting down to play an actual game, but at least it doesn't seem like it would get caught in an endless bash-the-leader loop.

My issues with this game are the same issues as with Coup: calling someone's bluff is usually a fairly obvious choice and the way switching roles works means that the luck element is higher than it is in Citadels (in which you at least have some informations about which roles were picked or will be picked).

I am blown away by the player range this game has had to offer. I have played it with as little as 4 and as many as 12 and it's always fun. With less players there's much more little deceptions and bluffing but with many people it becomes coup on crack.

I'm considering my review of this game as preliminary, as I had been warned it should be played with a bigger group. We finally got it to the table with 5, and I can see it really needs more.

In short, this is a hidden role game. You may or may not know which role you have. Declare a role and use his/her power, or try to switch cards with another player, or simply look at your card. First one to acquire enough gold wins.

Faidutti chaos rules here and it's clear he was trying a sort of party game take on Citadels. I think it has potential, but with a smaller number of players it's just too easy to know who has the King and Queen.

It's a light filler-type, almost a party game, so you can't really say it "requires" anything in order to do well, but if you could, it would be "memory".

This game is slowly taking place of Coup as they hit more or less the same spot.
Although slightly longer and definitely more confiusional I personally find it more desirable. In Coup even though you can lie, there is only not so much you can do to have your way through and, furthermore, it allows the focusing on  one player as target that brings the game down.
Here.. powers change hands, no elimination and the faces after a reveal is usually satisfying and fun

Still a good game. Drops slightly as other games move up. 

[September 2014 - 7.5]
This game is like Love Letter, Coup, Memory and The Resistance ... plus the feeling that you're three or four beers in. You're constantly switching cards, that by the third round you have no clue who has what. But that's the fun of the game. Best tip I've heard with this game -- if you're playing with fewer players, go ahead and try to keep track. Five or more, try and concentrate on what your card might be, ignore the rest. Seven or more, forget everything and just guess! That being said, you definitely need to be aware of your opponents coins and be ready to sacrifice turn to stop them from winning.

All I can say about Mascarade after 5 plays with 4 players is that I think that it's a very interesting game. You have bluffing, combo building via the character cards and a slight memory element wrapped up in a rather good looking package. The more rounds we played, the more ways for clever play emerged. Always hoping that you're the person you think you are or nobody calls your bluff in case you are lying.

The jury is still out when it comes to other player counts, but with 4 players Mascarade was a lot of fun. Sure, it's not a heavy strategic game but the chaos was far from overwhelming. All in all, it was a nice change of pace. The only thing I didn't like were the black bordered cards. After five plays, they are already showing some wear, fortunately not that much that certain cards are recognizable. I will sleeve them as soon as possible.

Double think can be a fine game mechanism on occasion.  I love San Francisco and Adel Verplichtet, after all.  Here it pretty much is the game, so after the course of one play it felt like the whole game boiled down to a simple RPS-esque question: did they switch with me or not?  Time will tell if that continues to be an interesting question, but for now I'd be happy to guess again.

Another great addition to our family of 7 games.  Great fun, bluffing and tricking.  My only complaint is that, as a turn, you can peek at your own card, yet for only the cost of 1 coin, you can challenge an opponent's identity on their turn to learn the same thing.  There needs to be more of a penalty for that.

Hidden role, bluffing game.  Claim a role (do an action and earn gold), switch roles with another player (or not), or take a peek at your role (in case you forgot or were switched).  First one to X gold wins.  Difficult game to play, if one or two people aren't trying or focusing on the right target someone will easily run away with the game.

Amazing game with use of hidden personality. Same author as Citadel, however it's quicker, fluent and much more interesting. You can have games that will finish within 2 min, or it will take even 5x longer. 
The only thing that will be missing is more personality cards (with less money generation as King, Queen and Bishop was already removed from our deck after 3 games - as they were too powerful (4 players game))

RATING: 3
A rather silly game of trying to track characters as they pass around the table.  Players have a face down character in front of them.  On their turn they may peek at their card, or swap their card blindly with another player, or claim to be a character for the right to perform that character's action.  Any other player may also claim that character - cards are flipped, the correct player performs the action, every other player pays a fine to the bank.  The actions on the cards are interesting, but this is a very chaotic game - more party than bluff - and very difficult to plan anything.  Fun for a play or two, then straight back to Coup I suspect.  The "fun" to "playing time" ratio feels off here - this should be a 10 minute piece of fluff, instead it's a 30+ minute game and that's too long. The character cards are very attractive.

Comes close to being a mini-game like Coup or Love Letter, but somehow doesn't approach either, although on paper it seemed like it should.   Maybe there's too much guessing and not enough bluffing.   The box says 2-13 players, which is pretty much a total lie.   Replace that with 6-10.   Dropped off my want list, although I'm certain it would be fun to play a face-up variant with drunk people.

[b]10.6.13 Update:[/b] Just attended a con where this was arguably one of the most played games. It was so handy that it was capable of entertaining up to 13. Everyone could join in (and boy did they). Enjoyed by all.

Imagine the bastard child of Coup and Love Letter and then some.  Even that sells Mascarade short.  This is a wonderful game.  I go for two types of game: long and thinky Euros, or short and fast pure entertainment.  No prizes for guessing which camp this falls into.  The game is just superb.  The tension around the table is palpable; the bluffing, the groans, the laughs are infectious, and through all this the game plays so smoothly.  The calls of those folk who say it is just a random guess-fest are missing the point of the game.  Random guess-fests can be incredibly entertaining and this one sure is.  Besides, a game lasts 15 minutes, and it is over before you know it, but with that hallmark of a great game when the table clamour for 'just one more round'.  It's only January but this is heading for my game of the year.  In summary:  if you like Love Letter but  have more than 4 people then you will love Mascarade, no doubt.  You do need 6 players for it to start to shine, and shine it certainly does.

Go play Coup instead. You can actually bluff the heck out of everyone in Coup. Mascarade feels like my freedom of speech has been removed. I feel like the androids in Cloud Atlas when I play this game. This is exacerbated when you play with a larger group. It's all note taking and shell game. Zero actual bluffing. 

Can I lie yet? When can I lie? I'm the Ambassador! That's not even in the game! Who cares! I want to lie!

I have an unreliable memory, so would have thought that a game with such a vital memory component would not be to my liking. Mascarade, however, allows a player to maneuver with bluffing and deduction, aided by the occasional reveal, to scale back the need for hard memorization. This is the kind of game I would propose to any level of gamer, from my grandma to my Power Grid opponents.

Four plays. The memory components of this are more challenging that I thought they would be! Keeping track of which roles people have and which swaps have probably been made makes the showdowns a lot of fun.

I played Coup recently, and Mascarade seems to have a lot more shifting in roles which is challenging to keep track of.

Mascarade truly shines with large player numbers.

qwertymartin: "File with Coup and Love Letter in the new wave of social microgames, with an added dash of Faidutti chaos. It's more of a party game than Coup, especially with 8+ players, and having players not knowing their own card is a stroke of genius.  Mascarade is mechanically quite similar to Coup but it's more chaotic and has more of a party-game feel, especially with more than 6 players."

Hard to keep track of characters?

It's OK on occasion with the right group, but my answer to the question, "Which do you like better, Coup or Masquerade?" is "neither." Or Love Letter. Actually, I'd rather have a conversation in this time space than force one of these microgames that are suddenly all the rage.

Érdekes kettősség a játékkal kapcsolatban: úgy érzem kívánja az alkoholt, mert ilyenkor oldottabb a hangulat, bevállalósabb a társaság, viszont ez az állapot rontja a memóriát, amit viszont megkívánna a játék! De talán éppen ezért szeretem nagyon! Nem szabad görcsösen koncentrálva játszani, hisz nyerek, vagy vesztek, tökmindegy, mert gyors, így mindig van esély egy újabb partira!

Not heard of this one but the b/f picked it up as it was described as resistance for gamers.

Really nice simple game idea that very quickly gets quite complicated as roles swap -or not- so often its very hard to keep track. 

The few 6 player game I played all suffered at the end with several people being close and there not being enough to stop them all from winning.

Simple enough concept that the daughter can play, and whilst she cannot yet see board positioning she is damn good a picking a character and keeping track of it. If she has a bit more confidence playing with a group of adults she would have won, but she doubted herself and checked she was correct which allowed another player to slip in a grab the victory.

Sold with the promo in 2016.

I love Citadels and this was pitched as Citadels with all the boring bits removed.

It turns out that I loved the boring bits of Citadels. It lends the game structure and pace. Mascarade is a game of hidden roles but quite often your role is hidden from you as wel!

There is a little too much randomness to make this anything more than a party game for me. but judged on that criteria, it's a really good party game with many laugh out loud moments, agonising groans and cursing of one's luck. My collection has room for a game like this.

RATING: 7
A játék elemei nagyon szépek, a grafikák kicsit nyomasztóak, de profik.
Elég kevés dolog jár a játékhoz, az árához képest. Tizenegynéhány kártya, pénz, meg egy bíróság táblácska, meg persze szabály és pár segédlet. Igazán adhattak volna annyi segédletet, hogy mindenkinek jusson.

A játékszabályok pofonegyszerűek, három perc alatt meg lehet tanítani bárkinek. Egyedül a karakterek leírása tarthat tovább, főleg, ha sokan játszunk, mert ilyenkor többféle karakter kerül játékba.

A játék során mindenkinek van egy titkos karaktere, ami olyannyira titkos, hogy még ő maga se nézheti csak úgy meg. A körödben három dolog közül választhatsz.
1. megnézed a karaktered
2. cserélsz vagy cserét imitálsz valakivel. Nem nézheted meg egyik lapot se, és az asztal alatt vagy kicseréled a két karaktert vagy nem. Ezt csak te fogod tudni biztosan (jó esetben).
3. Kimondod, hogy én vagyok az XY. Ekkor bármely más játékos is bejelentheti, hogy nem te vagy, hanem én. Ezután minden jelentkező játékos megmutatja a lapját. Aki tényleg az volt, amit bejelentettek végrehajtja az akciót, mindenki más büntit fizet a bíróságra. Viszont, ha senki nem mert ellenszegülni a bejelentésednek, akkor nem kell mutatnod, hanem alanyi jogon megkapod a jussod.

Ha valaki 12 pénzt szerez, megnyeri a játékot.

Az első játékot négyesben próbáltuk, de így annyira nem állt össze a dolog. Viszont a másodikban hat fővel már nagyon jól működött. Képtelenség megjegyezni, hogy kinél mi van, és a karakterek képessége miatt a játék különböző szakaszaiban mindig más karira vágysz, így beindul a csere-bere. Sajnos azért így is van olyan, hogy pusztán rendőrködésből kell valakitől elvenni a karit, ilyenkor persze kérdéses, hogy ki vállalja magára az esetleg kisebb hátránnyal járó műveletet.

Kifejezetten party játék, vagy ahogy mondani szoktam TÁRSASjáték. Nincs értelme maguk elé meredő, gondolkodó geekekkel játszani. De marha jókat lehet mulatni egy kommunikatívabb, haveri társaságban.

u.i.: kártyavédő kötelező, mert rengeteget csúsznak-másznak a lapok az asztalon, és a játék szempontjából kritikus kérdés, hogy ne legyen semmi megkülönböztető jel, hiba rajtuk. A kártyák dixit méretűek így kapható hozzá pl. a szellemlovasban.

Mehet a 6.9 még följebb is, ha nagy társaságban jól muzsikál majd. 6 fő alatt nem igazán merném ajánlani. Nomeg gémer társaságba se nagyon való.
-------------------
6 fővel elég jó mulatság.

RATING: 5
Surprise, surprise! Mascarade is a very chaotic game. Faidutti's games often wear out their welcome with me during the course of the game because they don't come to a timely end. Mascarade kind of falls into the same slot even though the roles ensure that there is a continuous influx of money into the game which is certainly an improvement.

The underlying idea is certainly sound but I think it doesn't quite deliver. Challenging is cheap which is nice on one hand and results in many confrontations but also kind of destroys any basis for effective bluffing on the other.

Not really my style of game because I have a lousy short term memory. However still enjoyable to play and socialise with the other players - I'm just not in any way going to win (or even make the best choices). Surprising in its ability to handle a large number of players comfortably. Tempting to get a copy just because of this. Also quite interesting in that it doesn't overstay its welcome by dragging on.

RATING: 7
Really-really short game. Felt really-really random. I always had a hunch of what was going on, but it was usually proven to be wrong. You definitely need some light-hearted partners to enjoy Mascarade. We chatted and laughed a lot while playing and usually hardly noticed if someone has won.

In my book that makes a pretty good party game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A lot of turns are very scripted since players practically have to swap (or not) cards in order to distribute confusion and then the first player to make a mistake causes a huge crash of coins entering the economy until someone wins.
It is very interesting between the bluffing and memory, but the cost of guessing wrongly in many cases is so high as to make the game frustrating. And this is not a game that players can play flippantly: Players all need to bring their A-game or else the whole thing will be destroyed by incompetent players.

Fun group game. Easy to learn, easy to get non-gamers involved. The cards, though, get marked up easily (especially by fingernails), and it can become easy to see whether the cards were swapped or not.

Update: I created player aids with all the different roles (so people can see what's possibly out there) that will doubly serve as a shield/cover for the player's card, so you can't gain an advantage from studying the backside of someone's card.

The main attraction for this game is that you can play 10, 13 players if need be, and nobody needs to be a gamer to get in on it. In other situations, we never think of playing this game.

I love bluffing, role selection, deduction and party games... but this game really rubbed me the wrong way.  I wince even just thinking about it.  

Firstly, the 'memory' aspect of it put me off.  Second, though I really enjoy bluffing (and I consider it a skill), but this game seems to trivialize bluffing and reading to the point where they are much more shallow and empty.  Third, you often know someone is lying but for gaming reasons you shouldn't call.  Lastly, I don't understand why there is even a connection between my disbelief in what someone else says and my own role.  I mean, if I think you are lying shouldn't that be enough for me to point out your lie?  Why do I have to be the person you are claiming (to escape penalty)?  Shouldn't I be encouraged to uncover all false claims?  Sorry, something about this aspect of the game felt very off-putting.

This game seems to get a fair amount of love.  Fair enough.  Different strokes for different folks.  But it is not my kind of game and it might not be for you either.  So, you might want to play it before buying it.  

Cheers

Designer Bruno Faidutti's card game masterpiece of hidden roles and unknown identities. Don't even bother with The Resistance - this is the one you want. Expandable from 2 to 13 players (and you'll actually want to play a game with all 13 at some point), this game will keep you guessing, pointing and laughing. It will utterly amaze you. At many points in the game you are unaware of your own identity, but it doesn't stop you from attempting to steal or collect the last coin that puts you over the edge and into victory. As you pick up the coin and slowly return it to your pile, daring anyone to challenge you, at the last moment, someone does. 
"You aren't the King. I am!" 
They flip their card. 
And suddenly you realize, that person IS the King, and you've been unmasked as the Fool, a role you've probably been for several rounds.
One of the best party games I've ever experienced, and one that you will play over and over. 
Quick Tip: Buy two copies. It's cheap, and you'll want to keep one locked away so no one damages the beautifully illustrated over-sized cards. Or maybe you'll give the extra copy away as a gift.
I did.

After chasing the out-of-print Coup for about six months, I got this off a friend. After an intense play session, I'm hooked! This is even better. See, in Coup you can deterministically figure out what's going on and win, but Mascarade makes it more dynamic and fresh. I love it, and can't wait to try it with more people and characters.

Interesting bluffing game, a bit like Coup, but with added chaos. Not sure about it yet.

A playable social game which seems to work well with distracted groups-- if everyone focused it would be brain-burning and I suspect tedious. But it's an okay mess to stomp around in and feel triumphant when you fool someone.

RATING: 8.8
Double, tripple, quadruple bluffing! Mascarade mixes uncertainty and suspicion and deduction incredibly well into a confounding experience. It's great to think you've accounted for multiple blind swaps and truly think you know who you are only to be utterly lost...never played a game that pulls of this experience without devloving into complete unstructured randomness. Highly highly recommended. Really want to play at a number of different player counts to see how things change. sleeved

I believe this can be a really good game when all players know the cards and cardplay well. The first few games may fall a bit flat however. In my first game everyone just kept calling their own role without much shuffling going around. But once you realise you'll need to go for other cards in order to come out on top it gets interesting.

Chaos at it's best.

MdM 2014.12.10 y .23

Filler del autor de Ciudadelas. Cada jugador tiene un personaje OCULTO y 3 posibles acciones en el turno: mirar que personaje tiene, intercambiar su personaje (con la mesa o con otro jugador) (en la mesa hay un personaje adicional al numero de jugadores, despues de haber sorteado que personajes se utilizan en la partida) y ejecutar la accion de su personaje... cosa que se puede hacer sabiendo que personaje se tiene o no. Esto lo pueden protestar los demas jugadores (tengan el personaje atribuido o no). facil no?

gana el que consiga 13 monedas. ahora bien, vete a conseguirlas antes de que te vuelvas loco intentando pensar que personaje tienes y que personaje tienen los demas xD

desconfios, puteos por lo bajo y por lo no tan bajo y risas aseguradas. un magistral juego en el uso de personajes/roles. hecho con poquisimo material. (un puñado de cartas, por cierto muy bien ilustradas, y unas fichas para representar el dinero, y para de contar). 

un excelente filler para casi toda clase de publico.

It's like Coup but with none of the problems. To avoid frustration, when teaching rules, be sure to let players know that *everyone* is having the issue with forgetting everything - it's known as the Dementia Simulator. I know some people hate feeling like they should know more than they do, but that's the entire point of this game and the confusion is what makes it so damn fun.

I always compare these two Faidutti games (this one and the Citadels) and I think that Citadels is better. It has more game in it than this one. Same kind of deduction and bluffing elements, hidden roles and all that are present in both games. In the end Citadels have a lot more longevity than this one. With a lot of players this is enjoyable, highly enjoyable. And as always, art work look fantastic, one of the best looking cards I've ever seen in games.

A fantastic alternative to The Resistance.  It is more accessible partly due to its rules and partly because some have complained that The Resistance leaves them feeling like "the last kid to be picked for football", on account of certain players' loud and domineering approach to the game.

Mechanically, there is little similar to The Resistance other than an element of deduction - the comparison arises because they are both short party games which accommodate large numbers of players.  I prefer The Resistance, but I highly recommend this as an alternative.

I should compare it to Citadels since they are by the same designer.  Personally, I prefer it by a long way.  Citadels is too complicated for a quick party game, and too light for a gamers' game.

After more plays, I am reducing the rating.  This can end up in a bit of a rut if players do not make an effort to mix up the cards.  Sometimes games with new players are more annoying than fun!  This probably plays best with fewer players, perhaps six or seven.

Fantastic game that requires a good sized group to play, so I don't get to play it as much as I would like.  The bluffing mechanic where people may or may not trade cards (this is done under the table) really makes the game more awesome for me and I wish more games had similar kind of mechanics.

While the randomness was expectedly lower, probably due to prior knowledge on how to effectively play the game, the game still didn't hit the mark as compared to love letter.

Mascarade reminds me improvised role-playing game. Players have to act various character part during game. The changes of game circumstances is real time and fast enough. Game participants are easily stuck into chao. I guess the game is originally designed to confuse players. Without a doubt, Mascarade really bamboozles everyone. The game requires fast and correct judgement on ever-changing circumstances. Moreover, this game also needs sharp memory ability. The game usually stands around 15 to 30 minutes. I am sure this game has its own advantages to be appealed to gamers. Comparing with Citadels, Mascarade has easier rules and short playing time. Comparing with the game Coup, Mascarade is a better choice for me. Because Mascarade needs simpler role playing skill than Coup, players can get used to quickly. In Mascarade, players accomodation is also from 2 to 13. Mascarade is more suitable for party group gamer. In my opinion, Mascarade is one of Faifutti's best game after the issue of his famous bestselling game Citadels. The author is real good at managing psychological warfare among players. This is what the real Faidutti style game.

RATING: 5
A very simple card game that is surprisingly difficult to describe, other than it is a 'hidden roles' game.

All the players receive a role card which has a special power, but once the game starts all the cards are flipped face-down and won't be reshown unless someones action allows them to reveal them.  Players have the choice between swapping cards (or faking a swap), looking at their card, or attempting to take the action of a role.  The interesting part comes when someone tries to take the action of a role as any player who thinks THEY have that role in front of them can challenge, and if they are indeed that role then they may take the action instead of the player who announced it.

As you can imagine, it's very difficult to keep track of the cards (particularly as you allowed to fake a swap) so the game becomes chaotic very quickly.  This sort of doesn't matter though as it's pretty good fun, and there'll certainly be some laughs and finger-pointing throughout.  The only problem is, for me, that I was craving a game with a bit more structure afterwards and I couldn't see myself playing this game very often, but I guess it has it's place and is worth a try.

For me, this is in the late-night-silly-bluffing-closer family along with Kakerlakenpoker and Skull & Roses. Mascarade can handle more players than those two but also has a bit more to digest rules-wise until players become familiar with the roles. My gut says this is pure gold, but need more plays to know for sure.

Bruno Faidutti brings us another of his character selection games ... and this one is right up there with Citadel. Mascarade has close similarities to Coup (another great game) but IMO beats it hands down. The goal is to get to 13 coins (10 if your're "the Cheat") before anyone else. Some memorization, but even more bluffing (one of my favourite mechanics) contained within a fairly simple concept, and one of the very few games that works well for 6 and more than 8 (up to 13 players) within a reasonable time frame.

Mascarade is more of a memory game than it is a bluffing game. This is a problem because the game's chief mechanic - misdirection - is perfectly suited for bluffing. The issue is that sometimes players are too powerless to bluff - they know a player has a certain card or know for sure they do not have a certain card, so they can't challenge others when they claim to have a certain card. The only option in these cases is to use a turn to swap cards - an act that prevents one from making progress by taking an action to earn coins.

The game is short, easy to teach, and can play large groups, but doesn't give players enough agency to be an enjoyable experience.

Hidden role game, in which each role does something different.  On your turn, you can look at your role card, you can swap cards with someone (it's secret, so you can also fake-swap), or you can announce a role.  If no one challenges, you get to do the special power.  If there are challenges, everyone involved reveals and those who are wrong pay a penalty, while the person with the actual card (if any) gets the power.  Usually the roles involve getting you money somehow, because first to 13 wins (you start with 6).  Not sure what to make of it.  There's lots of information to track and it seems to have a "gang up on the leader" element.  Declaring and challenging is sometimes done for strategic reasons rather than because you actually think you are the given role.  So it's fun but the jury's still out on whether it holds up to repeated play.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (February 2014)

In general, I’m not keen about Faidutti games, however this one is a very good game. I love hidden roles and memory and in Mascarade, both mechanics feature prominently. The game can be explained under 5 minutes, and played under 15. The art is very good and the components are top notch, the coins are very similar to the ones found in 7 Wonders.  I love when someone (me :P) is sure he has a character and he doesn’t, hilarious. 

For me it has a very different feeling than Coup (still the superior game, but Mascarade is better than Love Letter), enough that I plan to have both games in my collection. 

I don’t have any negatives to say about Mascarade (yet), the luck doesn’t bother me as the game is so short.

Bottom line, the best Faidutti game I have played. I will buy it in the near future. Great stuff.

I should love this game but, for some reason that escapes me, I don’t want to play it. I own a copy of the game with all the expansions and promos and I have played it only once. For now I will keep it in my game collection but I’m downgrading its rating.

Mascarade is no longer among my favorite games of 2013.

I will probably sell Mascarade. I really like games in which the available cards are many and freely chosen, but that’s not the case in Mascarade. Which cards play depend on the number of players, so the high replayability factor is an illusion.  Would have loved to play with random character in each play, but if you play with 6 players, the same characters will play again and again. I also don’t want to play Mascarade with more than 6 players.

Coup continues to be king for me in this genre.

This is a pretty fun hidden role/memory/bluffing game. It wasn't as chaotic as I expected, because challenges end in role reveals, so at any given time you know what at least a few of the people have. I can see comparisons to Love Letter, although this has more meat to it. There are some really fun roles, but I found myself wishing there were a more of them to mix in to a given game.

Update: The expansion might breathe new life into this, but for now, as much as I like this game, I will generally prefer the controlled bluffing of Coup, to the chaos of Mascarade (thought I still very much like both of them).

Mascarade could be called "Complete Confusion" and I think that would explain the gameplay just fine.  That being said, it's somewhat controlled and a good amount of silly fun.  Imagine bluffing without having any knowledge of what card you have.  That's Mascarade in a nutshell.  Word to the wise: play with at least 6 to get the real feel for it.  Play with thirteen and it might just destroy your mind for life.

This is a fun bluffing game in which you claim the power of a certain role and hope to not get caught bluffing about (or just plain not knowing) your actual role. there are several games in this class (e.g., Coup). Here's what's good about this one: The cards are beautiful. There is a large selection of roles that can be added in various combinations depending on the number of players and the desires of the group. There is no player elimination. It is a quick teach.
Two possible negatives: It might be a little long for what it is, but I would have to play it a few more times with people who are familiar with the game to be sure. It does have a memory element that could be difficult for some players - others will likely enjoy this aspect.

Reminds me a bit of Coup with a touch of Bacchus' Banquet. Very chaotic, but a lot of fun. Not sure there's a whole lot of working strategies going on, since the overriding motivation is to continue stirring the pot to keep everyone guessing.

Seems too little control with 6, game is both too long, whilst each player seems to not have enough turns at the same time.

Overall, too much random, too little bluffing. Prefer Coup.

May be better with 4 or 5, willing to try more.

RATING: 4
It suffers from a very bad problem for me: Sometimes a player HAVE to do certain action (like swap cards), otherwise one will be letting other person win. Sometimes people don't realize what they need to do or make suboptimal choices and the game can be very frustrating for a player that wants to play it as best as possible.
So it does not work as a party game, which I think it could be used as due time and weight. It could work with a group of people very interested in the game (thinking mathematically in the game), but those people would probably feel that a lot of times the game does not let you play it, you got no choice, movement X is needed to be done, then player B won't be winning, but probably player C is going to win anyways. And at last, it can cause some heavy AP, which does not belog to a dozen card and some coins game.

Edit: After playing Coup it dropped a little more.

Messy party game. If you have a memory, and a visual memory at that, it may conceivably be possible to keep track of who's who. For me, the only thing I can do is lay claim to the Fool and keep messing things up for other players. Lighthearted game of bluff and confusion. Who cares who wins?

Bluffing game. Great art and very good up to the point where people start figuring out everyone's roles. So either up the player count or sow more confusion...

Hidden role game, I prefer this now to Citadels (from the same designer).

This game is not at all fun. I think the design is fundamentally flawed and will never provide a decent play experience.

A cleaver party game in the genre of Coup/LoveLetter/Resistance/Werewolf.  Supports up to 13 players with actual thinking, strategy, deduction, guessing & mayhem.

I am not a huge fan of social deduction games, but this one doesn't seem to be anywhere close as interesting as Coup, or werewolf, or any other game in the genre.

Pretty chaotic trying to guess what role you have and playing mind games to see if they actually swapped your character or not, but the roles are surprisingly quite balanced, with certain ones being better later in the game and others being better later.

You basically have to know all the roles in the game to be able to play well. There are counters to help you but your first play through for each new player count it can be difficult to take some roles into consideration when trying to play without APing.

- Los personajes más recientes que han sido levantados quedan prohibidos de ser ejecutados.

Hilarious fun, a big hit with most groups almost immediately.

My only criticism is the large cards get obvious nicks and can be told apart rather easily from the side without sleeves.

Also, the ending can get into a stalemate sometimes, or seem a bit stupid if someone wins because nobody noticed and prevented it, or someone is allowed to just use their card over and over because nobody swaps.

RATING: 9
Type: 2-13 light, card-based party game of bluffing, memorization, and chaos.

Best with: 5+
Weight: Light/Medium
Duration: 20-45 minutes
Notes:
good degree of memorization (or having fun without it)
some screw-your-neighbor involved
lots of interaction with lying, bluffing, or creating chaos by swapping role cards
some roles can be a bit complicated for a first play
requires at least some players making sure to inject chaos, otherwise one player will quietly keep knowing and using their role to win

Mascarade is a party game that plays up to 13 people and involves bluffing, lying, and memorization. Players are handed face-up cards that are then turned face-down. Players then secretly swap (or not) their card with someone else. As play continues, each player has a chance to declare what card they have, and attempt to play that card's ability to gain coins. Other players have the option to challenge that first player and claim that *they* in fact have that card. Hilarity ensues as players attempt to memorize cards, create chaos for players who know their cards, and try to amass 13 points.

This game is fun. It involves everyone, there is very little downtime since you do have to pay attention to what everyone else is doing, and there is some strategy to the game as well, as long as someone isn't messing with you. There is also tons of chaos as cards move around...or not. It is also very quick, scales really well as more players are added, and keep things moving. Unlike other party games, this one scores only at the end, so everyone is participating from start to finish.

I also like that cards can be swapped in and out between games to vary the given abilities up a bit. Not enough chaos happening with your current players? You can put in a few cards that allow players to swap more cards around...or not swap them!

One potential downside is the problem of having to memorize cards. This is easier with fewer players (I'd say less than 5), so anyone who just wants a good time and doesn't spend much effort trying to figure out where the cards are, is going to be at a disadvantage.

This can be somewhat fixed by having one or two players specifically tracking the game and calling out when cards are still known and a player is benefiting from no one resetting their doubt in what they have. This keeps other players aware of known cards and helps them target the ones who might be surging ahead.

Also, while some players will immediately forget which card they were planning to keep or not, this just adds more fuel to the chaos. And that really is the main thing that makes this game more fun than others like Love Letter or Resistance: the inherent chaos!

Similar games in my collection: One Night Ultimate Werewold (interactive role-based party game), The Resistance (interactive role-based party game), The Resistance: Avalon (interactive role-based party game), Love Letter (card-based, light large-group game)

Excellent bluffing and party game.  When playing with new players it starts out slow, but once the players understand how it works and once it gets going, it is a riot.  Lots of laughter and surprises.  I also like the fact that unlike Coup it does not have progressive elimination, instead everyone is involved and with a chance to win until the end, which makes the game exciting and engaging for all.  All players wanted to play it again after the first match.  Another advantage is the length, excellent filler to take a break from heavier games, icebreaker, or close a session of playing.

Like Coup, but without any player elimination. Players in Mascarade start with six coins and a randomly dealt character card. Characters stay face up just long enough for players to more or less memorize them, then are turned face down. Your goal is to be the first player to hold 13 coins, and figuring out which one is your card, and then activating it, will get you more coins. Cards get swapped all the time though, so it's hard to keep them straight.

RATING: 5
Interesting memory game, where you need to use fuzzy logic  to win. Bluffing and taking some risks can also help. 
You need to be with enough people to make this an interesting experience. I played it with 8 and that seemed to be a good number.
Note that you need to be very concentrated to play this game. 

If you want to make this a party game, just talk and laugh in between to make sure nobody can remember anything. But I prefer the serious variant.

I have a feeling the rating will go up once I play a few more times, but I have to say that this one went off really well  on the first play with a group of mostly non-gamers.  I'm sure there is strategy in there somewhere, but mostly, it is a fast paced game of total confusion and fun.  Absolutely beautiful components and a GREAT game to play with large groups if you want to avoid the typical party-style game.

A game of hidden roles (hidden even from the card-owner.) It's taken me a few games to work out some of the tactics - especially the importance of not allowing someone with a good role to keep it and re-use it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
There's a ton of good buzz behind this game, despite its merely good rating. I'm not convinced that it lives up to the hype yet, more plays will tell. In my opinion, the success of this game is highly conditional. First, you need to have the right group. That is, you need a group that is willing to trade frequently, and not just use their ability. If the latter occurs quite often, everybody knows what they have, and the game (for what it is) becomes pointless. Second, you need to play this game more than once. It's definitely not a game most people are going to "get" after one play. Third, and perhaps most importantly, this game should not be played with more than 7 players. 10 players (which is the number I played at) was way too many, but not in the way you would think. I thought ten would make it more chaotic. However, our game, as previously hinted, was not chaotic at all. Instead, 10 was too many because there was too much time between turns. I won on the fourth turn, and that game took about 35 minutes. A turn every 9 minutes or so is just too long too wait for this game. I'm hoping that my itital rating (7.5) will increase after further plays.

Update: Played this twice with 5 players at BGG con 2014. It plays a LOT better than 10. I'd say that I wouldn't want much more than 7 or so in this game. We had a great time, and there was still plenty of doubt with 5. Best of all each game only lasted about 20 mintues or so.

2nd best game of 2013.
Awesome bluffing game that replaces pretty much all similar older games (think Citadels, Coup etc.) and at least for me became the only one I'll need to own in the genre. It's a nice change of pace to all the social deduction games I love, with different type of deduction going on and more of actual boardgaming feel. You can try to play this one very strategically if you like, and will probably end up having lots of fun on the side. Or you can embrace the silliness and chaos and have even more fun. Components and artwork are very good quality.

2-Player Comment:
*There's surprisingly good variant for two, but I'd highly recommend 4 or more players for intended experience.

I'm bumping this up to a 10.  This is a perfectly wonderful game and has all I could ask for in a strategic but heavily bluffing-based social game.  Maybe not quite as gamey and strategic as coup or others - but in terms of sheer fun, enjoyment, and accessibility, it's just top notch.

RATING: 5
Played a 10p game at Essen '14 and most people had to be dragged to that table so this could have played a role in our lukewarm reception of it. I generally don't like memory aspects in games, so this was another deterrent. Also, I didn't like that people had to stand up and switch places, which was even less fun in the cramped Asmodee booth at the convention. Not my cup of tea.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This rating is very tentative as I expect the game plays best with more players and we only had 4.  It's still been a lot of fun, but some games/setups are better than others.  This isn't a gamer's game.  If you want that, then look at Coup or something.  This is a wild, bluffing game of deception and second guessing.  With 4p, there isn't as much uncertainty as I'd hope to see in many setups, but I think we're still finding the sweet spot on the right characters to use. 

Hopefully, I'll be able to play this with more players in the near future...

Very interesting take on the hidden role/social deduction genre, with player often not knowing their own role.  The mix of actions works really well here and while strong memory skills are helpful, the gameplay makes it often impossible to be certain about much.  I can see the game being frustrating to some players, and multiple plays certainly helps once you know the characters better.  Maybe it wouldn't stand out as much if there were a lot of larger group games, but with little competition of games for higher player counts, this is certainly one of the better ones.

Mascarade has a lot of surprise in it. You swap the roles around, and eventually you'll have no idea where anything is, or who anyone is. It makes for a very exciting and surprising time.

The game isn't the most strategic, but if you're looking for a lighter game to get the evening going, I can recommend Mascarade!

Partyjáték, gyönyörűen megfestett kártyákkal, amiben blöff nélkül nem lehet nyerni.

Akinek a Citadella bejött, próbálja ki ezt is. Itt is vannak karakterkártyák, csak itt nem épületeket kell építeni, hanem csak pénzt kell gyűjteni a győzelemhez. Egyszerűbbnek tűnik, de nem mindig az, mert soha nem tudhatod, hogy ki kicsoda (olykor még azt sem, hogy Te ki vagy).

Játszottunk már vele ketten és öten is. Gondolom nem okozok meglepetést, de öten azért sokkal jobb.

Javasolt kiegészítő: pár liter bólé, esetleg belga sör, gamereknek meg egy üveg karcos pálinka és máris sokkal szórakoztatóbb.

Olykor kaotikus, amikor már azt sem tudod, hogy nálad milyen lap van, nem még a többieket követni... De sokan pont ezt élvezik (lásd javasolt kiegészítők részt).

Update (2018.02.12.): Nem nagyon került már elő, eladtam a kiegészítővel együtt.

This is a fun little filler game that can accommodate a huge (up to 13) number of players. The rules and mechanics are simple but the actual gameplay of trying to guess everyone’s roles (including your own) and keep track of them as they change is actually a lot of fun. I played a couple of games with seven and eight players at an open gaming session and it worked really well as people bluffed, double bluffed and took calculated (or really-not-very-well-calculated-at-all) risks. When I left the game to play something longer others jumped in and the game was played all afternoon - quite unusual for a filler, suggesting that there is a bit of depth to this one.

This is another game I would not hesitate to play again if I was looking for a filler that accommodated a lot of players and one I might think about purchasing.

RATING: 7
Mascarade ist ein Deduktionsspiel für größere Runden. Zwar kann man es bereits ab 2 Spieler spielen, allerdings verliert das Spiel mit kleineren Spieleranzahl seinen Reiz. Jeder Spieler erhält zu beginn eine verdeckte Karte mit einem Charakter. Diese sind inspiriert durch mittelalterliche Ränkespiele. Ist ein Spieler an der Reihe hat er die Wahl zwischen drei möglichen Aktionen: Er schaut sich seine Karte an, er nimmt zwei Karten und vertauscht sie (oder auch nicht), oder er sagt die Rolle seines Charakters an. Jetzt kann jeder andere Spieler widersprechen und behaupten, er wäre die entsprechende Rolle. Dadurch kann es zu Strafzahlungen kommen. Wenn nicht, führt der ansagende Spieler die Fähigkeit seiner Rolle aus. Wer als erstes 13 Gold gesammelt hat gewinnt. Hier ist nun klar, warum mascarade am besten in großen Gruppen funtkioniert: Je mehr Spieler am Tisch, desto öfter werden Karten vertauscht und desto größer ist die Verwirrung am Tisch. Wenn es dann noch eine gesellige Runde ist und ein bisschen Alkohol ins Spiel kommt, weiß am Ende Niemand mehr, wer wer ist - eing roßer Spaß. Nachteil ist wie gesagt die Spieleranzahl. Mindestens 6 Leute sollten am Tisch sitzen, lieber mehr!

A pretty good party game.

Because of the memory issue, players have to constantly guess and remember what cards are being passed. The mind-game part is the most interesting thing of the game. Because of this, inattetive players can ruin the game.

Also, I would suggest playing with one hidden card on the table (probaly a 5-player game that uses 6 cards) as it makes deducing much more interesting.

Mascarade has absolutely majestic cards, coins and artwork that make a player feel like they are playing something truly special. The game feels different and fresh by varying which cards and what player numbers are used. The excitement of knowing how to win and then waiting to see whether anyone else notices your plan in time to thwart your hopes is nail-biting. This is a more dynamic bluffing game than usual, with a memory aspect that doesn't actually overwhelm the game: Knowing the approximate location of a card is almost as useful as knowing precise information. The chaos is only an illusion. Each play reveals more strategy and psychology for the mind to chew on. Also, the official two player variant is genius, fast and fun. This is my favourite two player bluffing game. Mascarade feels like a platform for an endless variety of variants and creativity. Expansions will be an auto-buy.

Mascarade is just a clunkier version of Coup. It has more components and more characters, but isn't more of a game, its just longer. Its not terrible, but if you already own Coup, I can't see Mascarade being worth picking up.

RATING: 9
Very interesting game that reminded me of Coup.  Everyone starts with roles placed in front of them.  The first four rounds the player has to 'switch' their card with another players' or the one in the center.  'Switch' means they take the two cards, secretly (by putting them under the table) chooses IF they actually want to switch or not, than replaces them where they were.  After theses four switches the game begins and no one SHOULD know what is in front of them (you don't want someone to know who they are or else they get to just use their power).

Every turn you have 3 options, claim your identity and perform the ability, switch, or look at your card.  If you claim an identity people can call BS on you.  Whomever calls BS reveals their card, if someone IS the person claimed, than they get to perform the action AND everyone who was 'wrong' puts a coin into the courtroom.  

The game is a race to 13 coins, but it is a super fun deduction game that I look forward to playing more of.  Seems with these super cool quick deduction games the new one keeps improving on the old.  Resistance, Coup, Love Letter, now this!

RATING: 8
Battling with The Little Prince for my favorite full game of Gencon 2013, Mascarade takes the hidden-role bluffing of Coup and amps it to eleven with many more roles, no player elimination, and the possibility of a 10+ person game.  It doesn't *fire* Coup for me because Coup plays better with fewer people, but once the game-group gets to 7+ it's a VERY worthy choice.  One can only assume the inevitable role expansion packs are coming soon.

Be sure to throw some Dixit sleeves on your set before the constant card-handling chips the black borders, thereby marking your cards.

RATING: 6.3
Thoroughly enjoy this game; only reason I don't rate higher is because I prefer Coup/Avalon/Werewolf for the social deduction genre. 

This is better for people who prefer memorization and a bit more chaos instead of bluffing/arguing. Sometimes there's more actual 'game' here than other social deduction games since it isn't purely based on bluffing. Even if you know what everyone is, you have to make some strategic decisions about what to do (use your action, swap cards, etc.).

Fun light bluffing game, clearly descended from Coup but I like it a little better (possibly because it's more random).

Sometimes it's a little hard to keep track of what you know, but I think that's the point.

I laughed so hard when despite exhorting everyone to target me, my friend tried to bluff me by leaving me with the King, only to hand me the win when I called it!

--- Preliminary Thoughs ---

Very simple and elegant rules, lots of chaos (the more players, the more chaotic), some push your luck and a little bit of strategic thinking and memory.

It plays very fast and allows for a great number of players.

Seems to be really fun!

Nice artwork, but probably a bit overpriced.

Concern: Can the cards be sleeved? With that much card movement, some cards may get a scratch and then be easily identified?

I really don't see where the supposed game is in this one, especially since challenging rarely makes any sense. Gameplay consists mostly about just trying to prevent the next guy from winning. Also, if anyone wants to throw the game, it is extremely easy and quick to do so.

RATING: 5
Not quite the utter hoot I thought it was going to be: Mascarade is perhaps a little bit too dependent on all players being up to the same speed simultaneously. Which, when you are 8-up playing a filler, isn't a terribly realistic proposition. A Love Letter-Citadels cross is the right analogy.

Nice art, but not helpful in discerning the different characters. Which is the whole POINT of the art.

La note un peu "sanction" du jeu est justifiée par les faits suivants:
 - Il faut vraiment que l'ambiance se prête au jeu. C'est-à-dire qu'avec des joueurs lambda, pas trop axés "party game", ça risque de ne pas bien se passer. Je ne suis pas particulièrement fan des party game et pourtant en lisant les règles, cela me paraissait un peu plus qu'un jeu de bluff. A part du bluff et du party game, il n'y a rien à attendre de ce titre.
 - Comble de la malchance (ou bien ne suis-je pas le seul) : l'édition en ma possession est de très mauvaise facture ! Les cartes ne sont pas impeccablement coupées et les couleurs sont très claires sur certaines cartes comme le Roi. Puisque le dos des cartes n'est pas identique, il est impossible de jouer .... Merci l'éditeur ...
Je reverrai la note à la hausse quand j'aurai pu jouer à une édition digne de ce nom.

It is very sad that I see the average is below a 7.5 for this game. The artwork is amazing, it's like you bought the game for the aesthetics. The game is quite fun, obviously depends on the crowd. Personally I believe it can be great for even upto 14, though till now I have experienced that it's too chaotic to settle people down and thus I would stick with 2 to 7 players.

Bluemoon legends changed my views about Knizia (which to me was the posterchild for the "soulless euro" designer stereotype), and Mascarade changed my views about Bruno Faidutti. This is one really solid social game, with a lot of FUN to be had. There is strategy, but the way it interacts with the bluffing and memory parts of the game, is what makes it -sometimes- golden in my book. Now I will have to try Citadels again, if only to be sure it was as bland as I remember...

心得:
感覺不太有不換角色的理由
腳色能力強弱有差
不同狀況有些腳色就是無用
像是換錢的腳色如果執行成功一次
如果沒人跟他換角色
下次基本上就是只能換腳色了
刻意抓失敗來付一元知道自己腳色好像不錯
規則:
*起始根據人數選擇要使用的腳色卡，將對應的標記放桌面讓大家知道有那些腳色，法院板塊放中間
*每人拿6圓跟抽一張腳色卡，4~5人時多的放中間蓋著，所有玩家腳色牌蓋著，不能在看
*前四個回合只能將自己的腳色卡跟中央或別人的交換(交換時放桌下秘密選擇有換或不換)
*第五回合開始有三個行動可選
>開自己腳色卡看是什麼
>秘密選擇交換腳色卡，一樣可換或不換，如果在上家的回合翻過自己牌則一定要選此行動，經過一位玩家就不限制了
>宣告自己的腳色能力並執行，沒人質疑就執行能力，有人質疑(多位也行)，則一起開牌，是該腳色的執行能力，其他放一圓到法院
*當有人拿到13圓就獲勝，或有人破產，錢最多的贏
**之後腳色選取可自選，法官一定要，1/3的腳色要能拿錢，8+的8人以上才能用，農夫要用一次要用兩張，5人以上也可選擇桌上放1~2張
**3人變體  每人拿兩張腳色 但順序不能兌換
國王:從銀行拿3元
皇后:從銀行拿2元
法官:拿走法院所有的錢
小偷:從左右2玩家手上各偷走一塊錢
主教:從最有錢的人手上拿走2元
老千:手上只要10元即可獲勝
寡婦:從銀行拿錢，直到手上10元為止
小丑:拿1元並且交換(或不交換)兩個人的角色卡
審問者:指定一個玩家，該玩家必須明確說出他的角色，否則給審問者4元
間諜:觀看自己和其他一位玩家的角色卡，並且交換(或不交換)
女巫:將自己和另一位玩家的所有財產互換
農夫:獲得1元，如果有兩張農夫同時翻開，他們都獲得2元
乞丐:無能力(可自行創作)
篡位者: 指定一位玩家猜測她的角色，如果猜中了則獲得該角色能力
注意:如果下家因為此效果翻牌，則下回合他必須和其他玩家換牌

One of the new micro games that works really well. Similar to Coup in concept, in that you declare you are in order to take that character's action, but without having to prove it ... but I liked this take on the genre a whole lot more. In a turn, if you've been outed with a dud character, you can swap characters with another player, but in a really clever twist, you place both cards under the table and decide which to keep, returning the other, but of course because you don't get to see them, if you don't know who the other player was exactly, you don't know who you now are. Of course, if they've revealed on a previous turn, then you have the edge because they don't know if you've taken their card (you can declare it as if you have) or whether you've bluffed and kept your own ... because if they try and call the bluff thinking they're still who they were, but you took their card, then you can declare and take their action instead, plus they pay a fine to the judge. With quite a few character options to explore, it seems there's a lot of play in this, for such a simple game, and one which is easily called for again once done. A winner in the outguessing-game niche and ideal at it's game length.

The lack of information that players have in this game is second to none; most of the time you won’t even know what card you have, let alone those that your opponents are holding. Even small amounts of info can be key, following where a card has gone can give you enough information to make semi-informed decisions and that can be the difference between winning and losing.

The sheer number of roles and the number of players that this game can support is fantastic, a great party game for people who don’t mind a good dose of chaos.

I enjoy this game as an entertaining filler, but it fails with my group for the same reason as The Resistance: too much social deduction. I don't even have my brother's support with this one since he vastly prefers The Resistance.

Most of the time people use the look action way too often which kills the momentum and the bluffing.

I have learned that games like this don't go over well with a group full of analytical engineering types combined with people who don't like screwing others over.

Best with 6+ since you can get some of the more interesting roles in this way.

This game can best be described as Coup: The Shell Game.  Like in Coup, you have a role card, but you can claim that you have any given role, and gain that role's advantage unless someone calls you on it.  Alternatively, you can swap your role with another player by taking their role card, looking at both of them, and then passing one back to them (possibly the same one).  You aren't generally allowed to look at your own card, so after a while, not only do you not know who anyone else is, you don't even know who you are (which of course makes trying to call people out a challenge).  It's an interesting take on the concept, but of course the end-game devolves into trying to make sure no one can win on their turn.  This sort of game really isn't my thing.

Light party game, up to 13 people, which can produce lots of laughs. Each player is dealt with a character, initially face up, but all characters remain face down for the rest of the game, until a player announces that he's the X character *and* he's challenged by another player.

The "swap" action (which can also be fake) can really create a lot of confusion and chaos, an element that adds up to the game. Easy to explain, simple rules, quick to play and must-have for people who love bluffing.

This game uses a character-pick system that looks like the one seen in Citadels (same author) and Verrater, but this time, each player will be able to exchange his character with another (or not, done under the table).

Fun but fragile. Attention and memory are required just to know what is going on, but it can be too chaotic to be worth the effort. In the end it pays off, because eventually someone will screw up hilariously, and the whole table will explode with laughter.

Against the popular consensus, I like it best with 4-6 players. With more people there's too much waiting between turns, which is risky in a game that will stop working if players lose attention.

I got to play this at my local meetup today. It was an alright party game to start the event. Players kind of have to memorize a bit to play well and that aspect of board games doesn't really stick with me. It's not a "deduction game" like Love Letter or even The Resistance, but it could be because of the large player count (10). The swapping mechanism basically nullifies a lot of strategy in this game. I know we play this for the "ohh" and "ahh" moments so this game does a good job at. The game could end abruptly. Our group of 10 people didn't even finish 2nd round when the game is over.

Chaotic party game filled with lots of laugh inducing moments.  Great times when none of the 3 people who declared their card actually had that card.  As usual with faidutti games, I have a ball playing but rarely win.

Another hidden identity game that's similar to Coup in that you claim to be someone to gain their power but you could be lying. The winner is the first player to get to 13 bucks, and the different powers push money around the board in different ways. If I had never played a hidden identity game I'd probably be blown away by this, but I feel desensitized to this whole genre, so I had trouble getting excited.

I'd had Mascarade on my watchlist for a while as it sounded like another game in the mould of Coup and Love Letter. After playing it 5 times on the first night it showed up at London on Board, I bought a copy and have played 10 more times since. 

The twist that distinguishes it from Coup is that not only do you not know what roles other players hold, you often don't know your own! This is accomplished by allowing players to take their card and another player's card face-down, mix them up under the table and then put them back. 

Mascarade also supports an unusually large player range. I haven't tried the 2 and 3p variants, but with 5 it's a bit more strategic and with 13 it's an out-and-out party game. I enjoyed both a great deal, though I can see why the more strategically-minded among us may be turned off by the chaos.

After a 2nd try of 3 rounds with 5 players, I felt that it was slightly boring. Definitely a must try with more than 5 players though, which happened during my first play with 10 players, lots of laughter and "WTF I thought I was the (Character)" examples.

RATING: 3
One 6-player game. Very easy to get locked into a situation (Cheat) where a Swap choice is the only way to gain coins, in the next turn, but you either end up helping the other player and/or making it obvious what you each have and therefore likely to quickly lose a good card. 'Trickery' to avoid this leaves you where you started. Avoidance can really only come if there is a lot of trading after each reveal so as to introduce chaos; and therefore making it a guessing game. Ugh!

RATING: 7
Mascarade is a very good game for large(r) groups of 7-10 people. The game can play upto 13 but I've only tried it with upto 10.

The game combines bluffing and guessing in the quest to be the first person to earn 13 coins. The chaos ensuing from the possible swapping of cards among players makes for a social atmosphere during game play. The strategy element to Mascarade is quite thin but nonetheless, it is one of the few games that scales really well for large groups and can be a great ice-breaker given that the rules are fairly simple.

RATING: 4
I'd say this and One Night Werewolf fall in a shared category. Both involve bluffs based on partial information, but I'd say Mascarade is easier to understand, but lacks as much depth as One Night, but this isn't necessarily a bad thing. One is cards, one is tiles, both are a bit odd. Go for it if you have the dosh.

I'm sure some groups could find fun in this, but I think there are so many other good hidden role type games like Coup and the Resistance, and I don't feel that this one does anything that special or fun.

Social games are an odd creature - people either really get them or they don't. This title is nice because the ability to go double blind on bluffs lets people "breathe" a little in terms of lying. Unfortunately if you have people who don't have much of a knack for chaos this title still trips up.

The blank stares of confusion are unavoidable when explaining this game, but I am yet to introduce this game to someone who hasn't then had a blast playing it. There's bluffing for those who like it, but there's also a lot of deduction left for those who don't. The fact that you actually gain information on your card when you are called on your bluff helps players be more bold and engaged than in counterparts such as Coup.

Very interesting party/group game. I wish there was more incentive to do more swapping of roles to keep the early and middle rounds from being more known. It seems like you only want to do that when someone is about to win. You want coins and you have to pass on getting coins when doing a swap while everyone else can benefit from your move to block. Still fun, but the control of winning the game is mostly out of your hands.

A hidden role, social deduction game where players are various persona attending a mascarade. The market is seemingly saturated with these, but Mascarade stands out because of its simplicty and its role variety. Also, it plays better with more players. The more difficult it is to track others' roles, the more memorable mistakes there will be, much to everyone's enjoyment. Bruno Faidutti thrives on chaos, and when you play his games in a way that supports his design philosophy, you usually end up having a good time.

too much down time.  Even if you know that someone is lying, you can't call them on it if that's not your current role.  So players who are doing well (and can deduce/remember who they are) have less interesting plays.  Players who have lost track hare slightly more interesting guesses, but not much.  I vastly prefer Hoax.

interesting light social game made slightly more (or vastly less?) interesting (and way, way lighter) by shuffling two role cards under the table on your turn. in my experience, a few players forget which card was which even though they were in control of the shuffle. when this happens a few times then no one knows the board state and nothing can be gleaned by closely observing your opponent's choices. better to flip a coin. still, if you're looking for a similarly travelable alternative to Coop, you could do a lot worse than this one.

This game deserves a lot more love!
Pros:
- Beautiful artwork
- No player ellimination
- Plays form 2 to 10+
- Very customizable. If you want more of something just add characters that amplify it.
- You like really getting into opponent's head? Play it with low player count
- You want chaotic fun? Play it with big crowd
- Beautiful artwork. Really, it's so good I had to say it again.
- A lot of bluffing. Which is like it should be in a bluffing game.
- Plays quickly
Cons:
- Um.. Well, maybe it's pricey.

Seriously, why do people overlook this little gem?

This is a pretty fun social deduction game. It's good for he type of people who aren't a fan of the lying games - Werewolf, Resistance, Spyfall, etc. In this one, you are deducing information. Sometimes you might be wrong, but you usually don't know if you are actually "lieing". It's a bit more complicated though, than it needs to be, and it takes a bit to explain. I think Coup might replace this.

As I've sat with it longer, Mascarade has become one of my favorite short games, and probably Faidutti's best game since Citadels. I love the chaos it injects into the stale social deduction genre, where the player is sometimes bluffing without knowing it. This is a terrific game, and its expansion lives up to the same promise. My only issue is that it really needs at least five people to work well, and more is always better.

Another in the Love Letter and Coup vein, but this one adds more of a memory element. Whatever way you play it the game is going to be chaotic. The abilities allow for big swings in the victory points, but the swings go both ways and the situation can change quickly. Certainly the penalty for being wrong while challenging is so minor that it encourages more challenges when compared to Coup. But the downside of a lost challenge is usually more about the revealing of character information than the lost coin. Strangely the reverse is sometime true, when you've lost track of your own character and get some free information, even if it is open information.

It's a strange beast. There's some subtly indeed. Times when you know someone is bluffing or wrong, yet you let them get away with it. Times where the player way out in the lead is in one fell swoop in last place. It's wild, but with more than six players I'd be happy to reach for this game over Coup. No player elimination and quick turns. Another good little game for when you've got 20 minutes to fill.

Became a staple of the group of 20 something I play with. It's simple, social and produces a lot of laughs - great as a session starter to set up the mood. While being compared to Coup, it's a different type of beast altogether. It's unique in hidden role games for not being about elimination, but accumulation of wealth/points (control of game's lenght) and because roles will constantly shift. It's not so much about lying as it is about [b]confusion distribution[/b]. The more confusion you sow and lets confused you are, better off you'll be. Cards flying around, being shuffled, remembered, forgotten, then a couple of players try to block those threatening to win.  The chaos definitely has a Faiduttean signature, but it's like you're in control of the volume button (and you want it turned to 11). One of the most laugh inducing games I've played and I think I like it more than Coup and Love letter, but needs at least 7 players to work properly.

In Mascarade, players attempt to deduce the character they possess, all while claiming to be another character to claim its benefits. The potential for metagame is huge – should you call on someone's bluff, reveal your role and use the knowledge of your role to initiate a swap? Or would it be better to lay low and risk claiming a role that you're likely not?

Despite the interesting premise, the gleam quickly wore off through subsequent games. The chief problem is that the elaborate shell game is often indistinguishable from pure chaos, especially at high player counts. Memory skills help here, but I'd rather save it for a more controlled environment. The game also stretches thin as players pile on anyone close to victory (which is made worse if the Judge is not present).

A Citadella készítője le se tagadhatná, hogy a Mascarade az ő játéka. Itt is különböző szerepekbe bújnak a játékosok, de itt sokkal egyszerűbb a történet. Nem kell építeni semmit. Körünkben vagy cserélünk valakivel, amit azt jelenti, hogy elvesszük az ő szerepét és titokban vagy megcseréljük vagy nem, vagy megnézzük mik vagyunk vagy egyszerűen alkalmazzuk a karakterünk tulajdonságát. A karaktereinket fejjel lefelé tartjuk az asztalon így cserék során nehezen tartható fejben vajon ki lehet kicsoda. Tulajdonságunk alkalmazásánál ha más úgy gondolja ő vagyunk mi akkor vétózhat. A jogosan vétózó hajtja végre az adott karakter cselekedetét a hibázó játékosok pedig fizetnek egy pénzt. 13 pénz elérése a cél a 6 kezdőből. Akár 13-an is játszható a játék. Nagy partijáték a Mascarade, ami érdekes módon nekünk 13-an jobban működött, mint 9-en. Kíváncsi vagyok mi a lehet az optimális. Minél többen játsszák, annál nehezebb fejben tartani a cseréket, de így viccesebb, mikor valaki teljesen más, mint akinek hiszi magát. Nekem kellemesebb élmény volt, mint a Citadella nagyon kiszúrós játékmenete. Itt sokkal kevesebb igazán személyre kihegyezett kiszúrás van.

Funny party game which works well with more than 5 players.

Without expansion, in games with less than 9 players I suggest to play with 3/4 cards on the table (which can be swapped as they were real players) for more unpredictability.
Furthermore, for games with more than 8/9 players I recommend to use the beggar to decrease the power of the judge.

Decent game about hidden roles and deduction with alot of guessing. This game was a passing fad for me. When I got it everyone wanted to get a game on, in time it was forgotten and never played again or asked for to be played by anyone.I suppose it suffered from the craze of One Night Werewolf in my gaming group. Regardless, traded it away and don't miss it. Not a bad game though by any means.

Clever game by Faidutti, as always. I've played it with the full 13 and then just 6. 13 is way too chaotic, and it's much better when you can keep a little more track of what is going on. Still, I like how there is some bluffing going on as well as a memory element in tracking where the roles currently are. A nice change of pace and a pretty well-done filler.

Similar to Coup but more chaotic. With smaller groups I'd rather play Coup or Shadow Hunters or Kakerlakenpoker. The more players you have, the more difficult the memory element becomes, and the more chaotic the game. But with a larger group, there aren't many options for games like this, even at the middle of the player range. Still, I'd rather do something else. The artwork, at least, is outstanding.

Everybody in my group loved the game. The first game is actually the hardest as all the players need to learn what each role does but after that, bluffing and every sort of psychological trick becomes a tool to this very quick deduction game.

I probably wasn't going to like this from the get-go.  The player who set up this game said as much since he knows I don't like Coup very much and greatly dislike The Resistance.  This game is very much in the same vein.

Each player has a hidden role and on their turn they can do one of 3 things.  Secretly look at their own card to discover who they are, use a character's ability (whether they have that character or not), or switch with another character...or not.  This is the most intriguing part of the game.  When you choose to "switch" with another player you hide both cards and you have the option to NOT switch them.  When a player uses their ability other players can claim to be that character and all players who are not that character have to pay a coin.  Getting 13 coins is how you win the game.

My biggest problem with this game is how easy and often you can game the system.  Sometimes I love this in games, using the rules in unique ways to find new and interesting strategies.  For example, in one round I used the Bishop ability to steal 2 coins from the richest player and the richest player claimed to also be the Bishop (even though he knew I was him and he wasn't), to relinquish one coin and no longer be the richest player.  This move saved him a coin and was very clever.

What I have a problem with though is how this game allows you to essentially pay a coin for an extra action each turn.  Several players were claiming to be certain characters even though they knew they weren't just to reveal and look at their card for the price of one coin.  The "look at your own card" action was never used in this game because the benefit of looking at your card while also getting information on other players and perhaps cancelling their action is so much greater than the one coin price.  This happened so frequently that during most of the game you knew who almost everyone was and this drained a lot of what the game is away.

I think maybe it could be fixed if you raised the cost of incorrectly claiming to be a certain character.  At least in Coup when you're caught in a lie you are halfway to losing the game!

I am actually quite suprise how low the score is for this game. I like this game a lot for how fun and fast it is! It's easy to learn and it requires not only strategy, memory and sometimes a little luck to win. 

I tried this game as a 2 player game and it's fun! My boyfriend has good memory and he likes that he's able to track all the cards and guess whether I actually swap the card or not!

I also played it as a 4 person and 6 person game and it gets exciting and confusing trying to track where the cards might be! 
I like that you can play this game with up to 13 players

Overall, I also have a similar game, Coup and I like this alot more than Coup! Coup is sorta about random acts of killing, this one is about being smart

A great social bluffing game for higher player counts. Lots of chaos can ensue due to the nature of the hidden card swaps where not every player may even know their card's role. There is enough logic and deduction that players who pay attention can get a feel for how things might play out. Someone will inevitably forget which card is which when swapping though, which is always hilarious and fun.

After two plays, I don't quite know what to think of Mascarade. It plays quickly but there is so much chaos that nobody really seemed to know what they were doing. The card art is lovely, but the player tokens, to remind you who is in the game, are so small as to be completely useless, especially when we played with ten people. In addition, our ten player game ended with many people having only taken one turn...

It feels like a generous provisional rating, but we'll see where this ends up after additional plays.

This game made me realize that I do not like social deduction games at all, nor games with a lot of chaos & bluffing in it.

After a few turns, I even did not bother to challenge other player's roles anymore and was hoping for the game to just end.

Beautiful artwork you say? Very much so, but you only take a look at your card for a few seconds, so I even was unable to enjoy that aspect as well ;-)

Bad: The mechanics are somewhat at odds with each other:  it's a bluffing game, but you can't bluff effectively because of the uncertainty, and there are times when everyone knows you are lying, but the cost of calling you out is too high.

RATING: 6
I admire the concept of this game more than the implementation. Each player has a hidden role, which allows them to, in general, earn or move around money. The first player to accumulate 13 money wins. However, all of the role cards are kept face-down on the table, hidden even to the player who owns the role. As the role cards shift around the table, you must try to keep track of where they could be. This is made more difficult by the fact that any switches are completed in secret. While you can track the movement of the role cards to a point, the real fun comes in your ability to bluff. By simply claiming that you have a particular role card in front of you, you can take the ability associated with that card -- unless someone calls you out on your claim. In that case, all involved flip over their cards. The person who is correct, takes the bonus. Everyone else pays a coin to the center of the table.

It's a fun experience, even with a larger group, but just a touch too random for my tastes. I would prefer a bit more knowledge over the position of the cards. As is, I just have to throw my hands up, smile, and try to bluff my way through.

Hilariously fun. I'm not sure i've laughed more while playing any other game. It's very easy to quickly lose track of who has what roles but surprisingly still feel confident of who you are and who others are. Light hearted arguments ensue, and while the bluffing mechanic is a bit clunky (I can be penalised for calling you out even if I am right), and it may not be the most deep and complex bluffing/social deduction game, it doesn't take away from how fun and silly this game is. However don't try the two player variant, it's pretty bad.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I love this new movement of games that use just a few cards and create highly interactive bluffing/deduction games. Love Letter, Coup, Skull and Mascarade all work wonderfully and provide quick and easy games that deliver laughs.

I think there is room for all of these games in a larger collection.

What makes Mascarade so fun is that: 1) it really is funny to play a game when one doesn't even know what they are playing with.  2) You can absolutely know that someone is bluffing, but unless you have the actual card you get penalized too.

The second thing makes Mascarade completely unique among bluffing games.

Those two things in concert make for a genuinely joyful experience.

This is also a great choice for groups of 7-13. How many games do that?

Update: Rating holds at 7 (though it is a 9 when it clicks with a group). Great game for large crowds so it will never leave my collection. However, the set-up is a little long and learning curve is just a little steep so I gravitate toward Bang: The Dice Game, Skull (two sets) or Codenames for 6-8 players even though I would prefer to play this.


Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 5
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 4
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 5
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 5

Reminds me a bit of citadels, minus the city building, which is nice because the character selection can then have MUCH more depth. There is a ton of bluffing and trickery in this game. Maybe even too much, as you can lose most of your "known" information pretty quick. Overall a good game.

Mascarade is a hidden role game where you are trying to get 13 gold. You are randomly dealt a card (we played this part wrong, not looking at our cards initially, minor mistake). The cards had roles that gave you a special ability, mostly involving getting money or switching cards.

On your turn you can look at your role, switch cards with other players (where you put them under the table to create doubt if you did in fact switch them) or claim to be a role and perform the action. If you are challenged, you and any challengers reveal your cards. Anybody who is wrong pays a buck to the courthouse. Anybody who is the actual role did their action.

The roles we had in play (there were more in the box) were
King = +3 money
Queen = +2 money
Judge = Take all money on courthouse
Thief = Steal a buck from your neighbors
Witch = Switch money with another player
Bishop = Steal 2 money from the richest player
Fool = Take a buck and switch (or possibly not) two other player's role cards

This isn't my favorite genre, but the game seemed like it might be interesting and seemed less dick-ish than Coup or Citadels. However, it's hard for me to draw any conclusions as we misplayed an important rule. You're not supposed to be able to perform your role if it was just revealed in the previous turn. We didn't do that, so in both games the player who won had just learned his role and was able to use it knowing that a) that's what they were and b) that no one could contest them.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
A nice party game, in which players try to guess what card they have.

The game can hold up to 13 players, and has, usually, not much downtime, since in a turn the player only have three options of things to do:

- declare what card he have;
- look at the card he has;
- take someone else's card and trade (or not) with his own.

When a player declares his card (role), he can be challenged by anyone at the table. If no one challenges, the player uses the benefit/power of the role he said he had, [u]without[/u] ever having to show his card. If he is challenged, everyone that did this (it can be more than one person) and the declaring player show their card. If someone have the role declared, he can use the ability of it, even if it isn't the turn of the player - everyone that did not have the declared role must pay 1 coin to the court. Then all the players that reveal their card hide them again.

The game goes like this until someone reaches 13 coins or when someone loses all his coins. In the first case, the player that reached 13 coins will be the winner, in the second case, the player with the most coins at that moment will be the winner.

As one can imagine, [thing=139030][/thing] has a lot of player interaction and chaos - it is possible to keep an eye on the trades of cards, but since by the rules, the player that used the action of trading cards, shuffle both cards out of view and give one card back, keeping the other (which can be the card he already had), it is hard to actually know something - it is mostly guesswork. But you do can have some sense of possibility, like a player can have X, Y or Z, but definitely not A or B.

I think it is important to say that the game have one weakness: it relies on players to keep the game tight and less chaotic. I have a game in which the majority of players were inattentive, and thus the game was less interesting: players keep only trading cards, but usually one with the other, leaving some players with the same card over and over, and they keep calling the role. I tried to prevent this, but only one or two, among 10, can't do much. And it is important to keep a sharp eye, specially around the Judge role, since it is usually this one that will end the game (and normally with a big swing, because the coins can really add up fast in the court).

Anyway, most of the plays I had were really fun, and I recommend the game heartily.

Gorgeous artwork on a mediocre game. Don't understand all the hype around this one. It's almost all about bluffing.  I was expecting something closer to Love Letter if not perhaps a little deeper.  This feels even lighter and doesn't feel like it has much replayability.  I'm beginning to think BGGers are sometimes coo-coo for Coa-Coa Puffs given that this is way rated higher than Lost Temple by the exact same designer.  Lost Temple also has bluffing, but it also has other decisions and there's a real game under the hood.  It's very light, just like Mascarade.  And yet that game is in the 3000's and this game is quickly headed to 1500 or better.  Give me a freakin' break people.  Looks to me like gorgeous art is enough to make people spellbound into thinking they're playing a great game!

pure bluffing party game

[+] Artwork! easy to teach, fun once people start knowing the cards, few games play with 13p (14/15p including extra characters)
[-] after a few turns, the judge is overpowered

Have only played it with 7+, at which point it was a crazy chaotic experience with so little control as to be silly.  By the time you get your character and know what it is, the likelihood you'll be able to use it is extremely low.  My suspicion is that it's better with about 4 players, though it might get too dry at that player count.  For a better hidden role game by the same designer, stick with [gameid=478].

Is it a memory game? you could say so. Is it push your luck game? you could even say so. Is it a bluffing game? You know the answer. Overall this game is good for filler time and could be a hit with a correct group.

A very chaotically enjoyable game. Also a nice filler for the times when I play [gameid=25951] or [gameid=41114]. I have the German version of Mascarade. Since I want to learn German, it will be a useful exercise to learn to read the player aids.

I also have:

As a deduction game this is a little more chaotic than I like, but it's still a fun social game. i'd say i like it slightly better than Coup, but less than Coup with the Reformation expansion.

Bluffing.
Roles.
Bluffing.
Deduction (read: near blind guessing).
More bluffing.
Mostly confusion.

Bruno Faidutti finally cuts away everything else from his chaotic role dynamic and gives us a game based purely on them. The best way to play is to forget tracking anything and just wildly guess. Winning tends to happen by the skin of players' teeth, and seeing everything play out is definitely the game regardless of the result.

well, this made us laugh, but unfortunately we were looking for another kind of fun. the game itself seems broken, at least played in 4. we entered a stupid loop of declarations after which the end was unavoidable. we were just looking to ourselves wondering "is this a game?".
maybe with more players it gets better but there will be even more chaos, you don't know anything and just play randomly. not my kind of fun.

Fun and chaotic filler with just a hint of character selection. Every time you play it, someone else wins, so there's no real strategic decisions to be made here. But good fun for large groups of non-gamers.

It is very hard to remember who everyone is, because anyone can switch roles with anyone else under the table (or choose not to).  Cool game, but have not played enough to determine best player count.

Sir! you forget yourself. This is a hidden role game but not as focused on conflict as the others. Like a real party one usually cannot keep track of everything and this game replicates that. There is however enough to follow to have some strategy.

I can't recommend this game enough. Hands down, one of the best party games out there. It takes bluffing to a whole new level as sometimes you don't even know what character you possess. There are two downsides though. The first is that there isn't a good way to track which characters are in the game. The second is that it only really works well with 6+ people.

Best to recommend this game for family games or party games. Rules are easy to read and to start playing. Setup of the game is easy and the overall size is small and light weight. Best to carry around. Slightly better than citadel if you know how citadel is been played.

Conceptually fantastic, but really not that great in action. Extreme power imbalances, bluffs that are too easy to counter, and inability to perform the action you need are the norm.

Combining 'mascara' and 'parade' into a single word is cosmetic genius.  I'm now imagining an endless line of eyeball models ready to liven up my evening with eye rolls, wide-eyed wonder, and sultry glances.

I'm planning to ask out at least one mascarite for an eyeglass fitting and a viewing of [i]A Clockwork Orange[/i], if that isn't too creepy.

RATING: 5
A hidden identity game where each character gains money in different ways. On your turn, you can switch identities or not, claim to be a character, or peek at your identity. You win by scoring the most money so you not only have to try to gain money, you have to keep up with the other identities and make sure no other player wins before you get another turn. There is a lot of defensive play that some people don't get. I am one of those people so I do not enjoy the game but if you do this works very well.

Very fun bluffing game for larger player counts.

The game is definitely just chaos on rails, but when you're in the mood for that it can be quite fun. Sometimes if players stop swapping it can get a bit stale, but if that starts to happen I've found that forcing 2 swaps anytime you take the swap action heats it back up.

My only real gripe is that there are no quality sleeves for cards of that size. The mayday ones are complete and utter garbage and I don't recommend them to anyone.

RATING: 7
A chaotic game with beautiful cards, where players receive role cards, and then start swapping them while trying to keep track of them. You can use one of the roles special powers by claiming to be them, but other players might challenge you if they think they are the role you claim to be. 
Fun, quick, chaotic.

A highly enjoyable bluffing game, in the vein of Love Letter, and Coup. It should work well as a family or party game. It may have been the great company, rather than the game itself, plus it being the first play at SPIEL for us. It may turn out to be a complete random game of chaos. :)

I had kind of avoided playing this as I heard it was too random... but my first games were with small player counts (3-4) and at that size keeping track of most of the cards likely location is pretty doable and that made this pretty fun.  I prefer Coup where you always know your role and whether you are bluffing or not... but I do like the lack of player elimination in Mascerade.  Not something I need to own but I wouldn't turn down another chance to play!

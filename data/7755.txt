Very ingenious, at times one wonders if it isn't rather formulaic, but then you find yourself thinking like the real generals. The moment of breakout involves a large mindset change.

This one got mixed reviews. The designer was known for creative and innovative systems, so this should be worth a try.

This game puts you in the role of the Supreme Commander - you are back at HQ looking at the big map - you are nowhere near the frontline as you make your decisions regarding the overall grand plan.

Very clever game, low rules load, low density, and very good system.  It's scary how close to the actual campaign this can narrate.

Highly recommended.

[Knight] Another amazing design from Ben Knight. A simple low-density tactical game with a good simulation value that is also playable in one night. Complex factors like Allied air superiority are either abstracted [occasional bonuses to pre-planned attacks] and/or built into the units [low movement values for Germans reflect night movement]. The trade-offs for giving ground OR losing units makes for some great decisions on the part of the players. Highly recommended intro wargame that deserves a reprinting!

This game has a very mathematical, puzzlelike feel that may turn off some wargamers, but I found it to be a very pleasant distraction. Compact size, fast play (the average turn takes about 3 minutes), tight rules, and a simple but original Command Point system combine to make this one a real gem.  Despite the simplicty and abstraction, it does a reasonably good job of simulating the situation in Normandy at this time, unit and hex scale.  The game can be taught in about 5-10 minutes, and the 21 turn scenario can be played to completion in 60-90 minutes.

RATING: 7.5
Very interesting and simple game.  And talk about fast-moving, how many 80 turn games can you play in an evening?  Radical limitations on supply drive the game.  Allies need to shove artlessly until they can improve their supply situation.  Eventually the Germans willl find themselves struggling just to stay on the map.

RATING: 6.5
nice game, at it's time it openend a new type of wargame with activation point.
it's follow an historycal path, may be too much.
our game was marred by bad luck with dice for the allied the first 10+ turn so it became a mud-fighting.
this is it's problem, with few activation and therefore few combat, luck plays an important role.
nice but have to be taken for wath it is, a product of it's time and with high abstraction

Impression based on solitaire play.I am not a big fan of Western Front games but after playing it I better understand the problems the Allies faced in the bocage; it is really difficult to breakout.

RATING: 6
Derivative of Ben Knight's early--and superior--game on the same subject, GDW's The Normandy Campaign.  Both games have limited activation systems, but this game drops the excellent double-blind system of the previous game.  The combat system seems interesting at first, but it doesn't take long to realize that the game comes down to trying to roll hits with the Allied artillery on the German panzer divisions.  When that dice-rolling contest is over, I found that the draconian limited-activation system broke down during the breakout phase of the game.

Yes,this is a very good wargame. A lot of fun.
We experienced an allied victory 38 points and a German victory for the cobra scenario.
Rules are well written.

Need to play again to rate...after one play, though, I conclude:  this game is one of the great bargains given that it is oft available for $10 on ebay.  Very playable, though the end game may have its problems (trying to mop up straggling German units).

Simple but well-crafted game that works better than it has any right to as long as you don't think about it too much. The end-game in particular can go off the rails. 80 turns for the full campaign might be a little too much of a good thing.

A good little game on an interesting topic that can actually be completed in a reasonable time. It is really all about the battle of the build-up though. Once the Allies are out it is pretty easy to see how it will end.

80 turn wargame that can played in an evening? You bet! 
A streamlined, yet effective game, where limited actions make for tense gameplay. Reminds me of a simplified FAB Bulge.

RATING: 7
Nicely written rule set. The designer suggests beginners skip certain rules, which could make this a first wargame (I've only played with full rules). It basically has an impulse system which keeps both players involved for 80 (short) turns. The Germans can even counter-attack on occasion. Combat is roll-to-hit, but there's an option to pull out and regain a lost step. Should the German hold the line in key terrain, or retreat and save their strength?

Not too much stacking (up to four high), but it gets cramped near the beaches. You also have lots of units which may be inactive for many turns. The breakout in the second half of the game plays a little differently and is not as tight.

RATING: 8
Good, balanced game. The activation system keeps decision-making choices down for a hex-based game and creates a lot of tension.

Good introductory wargame.

A must have. One of those hidden gems among the miriad of low range magazine games. This one is really different. Fast playing, it offers some very original mechanics. Perfect for begginers, elegant and fun for experienced players. Although long time out of print do not hesitate trying to get a second hand copy from Ebay or similar and enjoy it

Fairly innovative as wargames go.  Mechanics are pretty closely tied to its subject, but they seem to work OK for its sister games (Sealion, etc.)  Limited commands and daily turns provide a very atypical pace.  For the Allies, the balance between buildup and bustout is key.  For the Germans, it's careful positioning and preplanning.  Still holds up after all these years.  A nice bunch of scenarios for a variety of game lengths rounds out the package.

Smaller very manageable game of the invasion and breakout of Normandy. Typical XTR, Nice map with oversize hexes and counters. Good clear rules, cover the entire invasion and the tough part of the breakout. The German line is strong, but when it goes, it goes with a bang.

Nice little gem of a game. One of the best games Command/XTR ever put out. In some moments the game feels like playing Chess.
Biggest advantage - you don't have to wait for your opponent as long as in traditional wargames :-)

Pure board game awesomeness, from components to simple rules to approximate 2 hour play for first game.  This game is beautiful to look at and play.  I have only played 1 four player game but I could tell this is excellent.  Don't know how 3 player would work.

Kingmaker in Eurogame format.  Very well balance and with lots of change up mechanicism so that you don't feel that you are left behind.  2 vs 2 in semi-coop move to try to secure victory for your side while trying to seek personal victory.  Card drafting and resource management.  Very nice component and somewhat a brain-burner for our first game.  Definitely want to play more.

After one play: Great production values, looks good, fast, quite light as a wargame. However, it is very random: secret orders mean there is a lot of guessing what to do. The alliances, which seemed like a great mechanism, doesn't have much of an effect: particularly because you are *not* allowed to negotiate or talk about strategies! This takes a lot of fun out IMHO (though speed things up.) There are a lot of swings back and forth, so much that it's hard to see much of a strong narrative, which is one of the things I love most about these kind of games.

Despite all this, I think it fills a niche as long as you know going in it's light & there's going to be a lot of randomness and guesswork. For the right occasion and the right four players this could be the game to pull out, but I'm not sure how often such an occasion will come up for me. I don't think I'd suggest it very often because the "no discussing strategy rule" really kills my enthusiasm... so I traded away. (Would still happily play on occasion though.)

A bit in the genre of Game of Thrones, and it certainly takes some time to play, but what a great game. There is some luck involved yes, but more than that, it is a heavy strategic game. You have to make an alliance with your game partner, but count on it to be broken at times. Really exciting to see who comes out on top.

Played it for the first time recently.  Thoroughly enjoyed it. A lot to take in at first, but the mechanics are simple with many strategic choices and a balanced random element (the cards). Rating probably biased by the fact that I was in last place for most of the game but accelerated to second; my fellow Yorkist came first. We were both beginners.

RATING: 5
Pretty good game.

Many paths to victory, great components, a theme that I happen to enjoy, hidden action planning, many difficult decisions, very little money, and the game is always undecided up to the very last turn. For all that, I'd rate this game a "9".

However, I got the feeling that winning is not something totally under your control. I mean, if you play well, you're gonna do well. But, in order to WIN, you gotta have the circumstances help you out a little at the end.
And I don't like that in my strategy games.

Some tips: 
- play it with 4 players. Any other number isn't worthwhile;
- don't attack your partner until the very end. You really gotta strive to try to win the regional elections together along the match;
- DO NOT be winning at the turn before the last. You'll be hunted down like a dog.

[ESP] Sé que puede ser dura mi nota, pero la verdad es que incluso antes de comenzar a jugar sabía que no me iba a entretener tanto. Me gustan los juegos que tiene harta estrategia, pero este es un juego más bien de deducción sin serlo, y en el que además todo el tiempo hay que estar cuidándose las espaldas, cosa que no me agrada en los juegos. Además hay muchos tiempos muertos mientras cada jugador decide qué hacer...
Obviamente tengo claro que las motivaciones para no gustarme el juego son tremendamente personales.

RATING: 8
Kind of a Euro wargame area control hybrid with a Wars of the Roses theme (but no specific historicity beyond time and place).

Gameplay is fun with nobles, towns, castles, ships, bishops etc. thrown into the mix. Collect your income, raise armies and make bribes etc. in order to seize locales and increase your influence in order to score VP's. Orders are all made secretly and simultaneously. Plays pretty quickly.

The game does suffer from an excessive chaos factor. Starting around the third turn there are so many moving pieces that planning becomes incredibly difficult. Also, the game can be merciless on anyone who rockets to an early lead as you can get wiped off the map but still hover far enough along in VP's to prevent you from benefiting from being behind until its too late.

Ridiculously good production values. The box is a bit big and heavy though.

The game has many great props: gorgeous components, simple rules, short playtime, great interaction, hidden orders. It has some flaws too: it plays good with 4, but I suspect it's not so great with less; it is very chaotic, since one can not truly anticipate others moves.
Overall, it seems a very good game, and I will surely look forward to other plays.

Heavyweight game but the game itself is not that heavy. In fact their a lot of randomness in the game so you are very dependent from other players. The gameplay is fluent and quite original but the bribe action makes it very uncontrollable. That's why this will not a topgame despite the very beautiful and decent gaming material

Firstly this is a big heavy game box full of great art and super sturdy gaming pieces. Which are all pluses to me. When playing the game there is so much you can do and so many possibilities. You cant stop everything happening or even predict what can happen. This doesnt worry me to much when I play. Just keep to a plan. I enjoy the aspects of area control and the team play as you and your 'ally' work together (maybe) yet you try and remain the higher scoring one in the partnership.I look forward to when I will be playing this again,

Wow what a game! The first time I played it I was a little overwhelmed and I felt there was way too much to calculate to make it enjoyable. Second time things fell into place. You just have to relax and let the game go its own path without trying to control everything. Just focus on a few important moves and get them right. In this game the random 'luck factors' are the moves of your opponents (and order of picking the cards). Very clever! I also love the look of everything. A real quality game for gamers. Very high replay desire. I think this one is going to become a classic.

OK - this is certainly a very good game but I found it frustrating in much the same way that I find El Grande frustrating, maybe even more so, because the element of simultaneous reveal means this area majority game involves a lot of second guessing - sometimes you are right and sometimes you are not. However, this chaos is not something I enjoy in a heavier euro and this is a reasonably heavy euro. Well designed, well thought out and with a not of nicely balanced decisions. Maybe not to my taste though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Extremely tense game.  Essentially, everyone plans what they're going to do behind the big screens then the plans are revealed and executed in turn order.

The "hook" is that it's impossible to cover all of your bases, much less, cover your bases and attack, so you're only option is to guess what the other players are doing.  Whoever is the best guesser and the most unpredictable will win.

Excellent production values, and a great game.  I like the secret moves/attacks, adds a real tension.  One must get into the mind of their opponents.  I also like the 'we are allies, but not really' effect of the roses.  Not a lot of history, but as an old Kingmaker fan, I think this game is a lot of fun.  And the 90 minute play time is a real plus!

BGG buddies say:  I wanted to like this game more but I felt like it was an "outguess your neighbor" and timing game. It gave me too much analysis paralysis; Nice area control eurogame, but with too much conflict for me. Forced alliances may be a bad thing. But if you like some conflict, this is certainly worth checking out.

RATING: 7
An area control game with simultaneous movement and bribery thrown in. Plus a bit of luck to make it all a little random. This game is fast moving and quite chaotic,

The danger with this one is that some people evidently won't be able to win going in to the final round, so they'll tend to play Kingmaker (hahaha, get it, Kingmaker, see what I did there? the old game of the War of the Roses that took ages to complete?)

An attack on someones income stream is generally sufficient to knock a player out of contention.

This is a good 2 player game, with guessing, bluffs and counter bluffs etc. pretty tight.

Latest Update:
Unfortunately, the "let-down" seems to have arrived, and I'm starting to come down from the sheer beauty of the production. Still, it comes closest to successfully re-imagining Kingmaker; but, the way the cards come out and the range of both offensive and defensive options, all done in the dark, makes this game very chaotic - at least more so than I can be comfortable with. Regardless of where I end up on the scoring track, I'm never sure that I had any kind of handle on what I was doing. There is so much guesswork at play in this game, and the consequences of "guessing wrong" so potentially crippling, that I'm finding it hard to maintain my interest in trying to come up with a viable strategy let alone useful tactics. The unreliable aspect of the alliance structure which interested me at first is actually starting to take away from my enjoyment of the game. I'm not reducing my rating yet and it's one I'll still play, but I don't find myself inclined to suggest it anymore (not a good sign).

Initial Impressions:
After several plays, I am impressed! After so much anticipation and the initial good impression, the possibility of let-down was a definite concern. I like the loose alliance mechanic, the hidden planning procedure, and the prohibition on "table talk" (although a normal part of most other multi-player games, here it is not missed). The game wound up after about two and half hours yet we felt we had re-lived an epic. The way the cards come out guarantee a lot of re-playability so I look forward to many more plays.

It appears to be a re-imagining of AH's classic War of the Roses title "Kingmaker." Four players will take a family representing either a Lancaster or York faction. At the start one starts with meager holdings but as play progresses one acquires influence in the six major regions of England and Wales, by contesting control of various Nobles, Bishops, ships, ports, cities, and towns in the struggle for supremacy. Play revolves around secretly assigned actions to move and fight to gain (or keep) control of the various locations, planning bribes for the favour of the various personalities and paying counter bribes to keep your own subjects loyal. The possibility of various cards (representing one's holdings) changing hands frequently must be anticipated.

The quality of the production is impressive. The board is large and colorful, the artwork is very thematic and all the bits are sturdy and well designed. So, if the game play lives up to the production, Z-Man will have done justice to this intriquing period in British history. Rating (8) is preliminary based on appearances and a read through. Stay tuned...

A unique game which cleverly weaves mechanics & theme in an amazingly satisfying way. It fills a very unique niche - both in the historical category & in the genre. Actually it straddles and incorporates several different mechanics in a very homogeneous whole. But just don't try this with your average party gamer/noob crowd. In the planning stage, it gets so quiet you could hear a pin drop! A Thinker's Game. Deep strategy & reading your opponents. It feels almost Martin Wallace-ish.

Tentative rating. Area influence game with lots of bluffing and mind reading. You (can) team up with another player. In my only play, I was attacked early and did not recover again, so the game felt a bit long because I was out of contention. Superb production value (again) from Z-Man games.

Super well produced quality components.

Essentially a very fancy area control game. Simultaneous action selection. Have to guess what the other players do. Can get quite mind boggling towards the latter half of the game.

Will need replay to reassess.

Second play: Chaos! Simul-guessing. Crushing the lead player to make the losing player catch up. The most egregious bash-the-leader-so-the-loser-can-catch-up mechanism known to gamedom. Blech. You have to purposely play 'badly' so that you don't get too far ahead or otherwise, gosh, the French gives the loser $25 to crush you, for which one has no recourse.

RATING: 5.5
Hmm, I really wanted to love this because I think the theme is great and consider so many of the main mechanisms to be excellent. However, the game is way too complicated (even if the rules are not), because there are far too many variables to consider while planning your turn, meaning players can really get crippled with AP. 

On top of that, the game is extremely punishing, as a couple of poor decisions early on will practically guarantee a player's defeat, which he will proceed to watch unfold in the slowest, most tortuous, and humiliating manner possible over the course of the next three hours. Sigh. Too bad, as I greatly admire this designer and there is much about the game to like.

RATING: 5
Pretty game.  Really chaotic.  I don't see what the big deal really is here, everything can be bought, everything can change hands, and the French card seems like a ham fisted way to deal with a runaway leader problem.  A shame there isn't more here, I like the theme and the components.

RATING: 7
An updated Kingmaker, at a more abstract level, which seems to work well as a semi-partnership game.  Avoid if you don't like bluffing/blind bidding because the central mechanisms of hidden planning followed by execution of the moves equate to multiple iterations of that - for me it's probably acceptable as it's not completely blind - you have a lot of info on the board and can make informed guesses about what the other players might be intending to do and the uncertainly is also in keeping with the theme.  Having said that, it does help if you can outguess your opponents.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is another of those games that I may well end up liking a lot more than anyone I game with. I think the bluff-and-guess is interesting and exciting, and I think they've found a good spot, given the game is what it is: there is plenty of information available to try to anticipate and guess your opponent's intentions, and trying to do so is fun for me and I find it to be a *far* more successful game that Wallenstein or Shogun. But, it's clearly not for everyone. I wish it were just a bit shorter.
---
First impressions were generally positive but not without some mixed feelings. I like how the game accelerates, and how the cards (nobles, castles, etc.) flow into the game, creating uncertainty and variability without just being chaotic. I like how the conflict ramps. The French Aid chit everyone gets is a cleverly thematic catch-up play, while it's still possible (like El Grande) to make early power plays that get you into a strong position you can ride; catching up is no easier than it should be. I like how everything feels expensive and money management is key. I like how it (generally) rewards aggression. I like the chaotic feel that seems in the right zone - mirroring the chaos of the historical conflict without just being random and crazy.

I'm not in love with the playing time. Figure 3 hours with the possibility of going painfully long if someone insists on doing a lot of analysis, which is possible. In fairness, I play with groups that tend to come in on the long side and we finished in 3 hours comfortably. But the possibility for a real train wreck is there, and even at 3 hours, this is a bit longer than it wants to be. You can easily be in a fatally weak position on turn 3 of 5. In any event, it does appear quite chaotic, and in general 3 hours is a bit long for a game as chaotic as Wars of the Roses seems to be.

Regardless, though, I liked it, and look forward to playing again.

great 4p games with really interesting complete open information but also complete secret bidding.  The only thing I have against this game is that it is brutal against new player.

There is a lot that is out of your control, but it plays cleanly for all the scheming.

Wow, talk about over the top production. And the huge board and nice playing pieces aren't even what I'm talking about. This game has the Sherman Tank of player shields. You gotta look at some pictures and see what I'm talking about. This is a descendant of Diplomacy. It has simultaneous programming of forces, but has some different twists, from say A Game of Thrones or Wallenstein, the well-know Diplomacy descendants. For starters, there is no game-ending objective. The game is simply five rounds. You score points every round. So very much a Euro. But the simultaneous orders lead to more chaos than AGoT, since orders are completely resolved when revealed, not with more player decisions, like the combat cards in AGoT. So people who don't mind a little double-think really dug this game. People who don't like double-think didn't. Like Diplomacy, all programming is simultaneous, which is nice. Also nice is that to fit the theme of the period, no communication is allowed between players. This helps to keep the game moving. And it never felt like it dragged. There are a bunch of other things, like choosing what you get on the board via a card draft, which also determines income, and what I particularly like: not just units on the map, but one of various types of things on each territory: castle, bishop, town, etc., each worth a different amount of influence, with the sum of influence being the driver for majority control (1st and 2nd in each area). Then there's this cool thing about being semi-allied with the player opposite you. There can be huge point swings, leaving the final outcome unknown until the very end.

When this game suddenly appeared in the catalogue of 999 Games (amongst others, I'm sure), I was a bit surprised. The game looked intimidating, and certainly [i]felt[/i] such. I never looked into it much as a consequence, until a few years later at a game fair I was unexpectedly able to play through it.

There is a lot of rules to digest, and at one point it helped considerably that at its heart the game is an area majority game, and comes with a rather large amount of mechanisms to have players alter the majorities in the various regions of England. If I remember correctly (augmented with a thorough scan of the rule book, as I'm typing this comment several years after having played the game, sad but true), the game first restricts where you can do what by laying open a series of cards indicating places of interest for that round. Then the game enters a secret planning phase in which all players simultaneously and secretly plan various movements, procurements, attacks, and bribes. These are then resolved, upon which majorities are established and awarded. A new round then commences, but not before it is established who will form the House of York, and who will form Lancaster for the next turn. Players belonging to these houses should not hit upon each other too harshly... which is an altogether nice mechanism which put me in mind of the seriously dysfunctional Die Sieben Weisen.

I also realised at some point that the meat of the game is in the secret planning phase, which quickly annoyed the heck out of me because there is simply too much to be planned. There is little sense in guesstimating what opponents will do: I think that you think that I think-mindgames are all but impossible to play here. However, had the game come without such a secret planning, it would have been much harder to play, for obvious reasons. What also annoyed me even more was the garish and completely unergonomic graphical design. The publisher saw fit to make the players play games with the material; you can forget obtaining a quick overview from a few glances. There is zero contrast between tokens and places where these are to be placed; and the concept of having a miniature map before you where you indicate what you intend to do but then leave out sufficient room for the ships is just bonkers. I was very glad when the game was finished: I hadn't been playing at all to win anymore, just to get it over and done with as soon as humanly possible.

As such the rate the game now gets reflects little its game mechanical qualities, but more the utterly stupid design decisions which should never have left the design table. Alas, on occassion such a game is published... I console myself with the thought that the weight of the box is such that a gamer can always use the box to knock a burglar unconscious with in case the latter attempts to steal the better games from said gamer's collection. I do not intend to play this game ever again.

Played this with my family ranging from ten to adult, and everyone had fun and was involved. Good amount of decision making and feeling like what you do matters, along with luck in the form of people doing unpredictable stuff.  Captures the theme pretty well, and the ebb and flow of the war.

A little nitpicky to track things, but the designer did a good job of trying to make that easy.

Bumped up to an 8 because people who matter in my life like this game and might be willing to play it often.

I loved Kingmaker, with all its flaws, and played a ton of it back in the Stone Age. This is obviously done as a tribute to that by people who loved it as much as me. It's gloriously overproduced, with the largest, heaviest player screens you will ever see. The blind planning is not a favorite mechanism, but if you're used to Kingmaker wild swings of luck aren't a problem. I like the semi-team setup. Gotta get this out again!

Not a perfect experience, but definitely a tense tactical game. Hidden planning and simultaneous revealing of bribing, movements and attack/defense make for some difficult decisions and Grade-A brainburn.

I'm not sure why, but I had expected this game to involve building behind the (huge!) screens, but it's really just planning. I'm not a big fan of tactical battle-based games--but this one is interesting enough that I'm very interested in playing again. EDIT: after another shot at it, it's just not my style. By round 4, it's way too difficult for me to put together a viable strategy, but this is certainly a well-designed and respectable game. (I feel about this game the way I feel about good jazz musicians... I can admire their abilities while really not enjoying their style of music.)

I should also mention: this is probably the heaviest board game box I've ever had in my collection. The large box is filled to the top with weighty, large, high-quality components.

Based on one 2 player game - felt a bit like a mix of El Grande, A Game of Thrones & Wallenstein. Rules aren't as complex as the size of the rulebook may suggest & after a turn or two it ran pretty smoothly. Worked quite well as a two player, but I'd like to try with the partially team based 4 player.
 Nice graphic design. :)

RATING: 6
Interesting hidden action selection game that creates a lot of difficult decisions. The mechanics are simple and the strategies subtle, though I can see why some people might not like the guesswork.

There are several mechanisms in the game that allow players to catch the leader, to the point where taking an early lead may even be a very bad idea. Good stuff, IMO, though it's still pretty light stuff. Would play again from time to time.

But [i]Kingmaker[/i] it is not. Whether or not that's a good thing is up to you.

Minor nit, I don't understand why the designer put two "Neville" nobles in the game instead of picking one of the many other nobles that could have been used. It just adds confusion, and it's not like this is the sort of game that's going to come in for any serious historical analysis anyway.

Update: Decided to trade. Not a bad game, just not deep enough for me.

Provisional rating based on one play.

I really wanted to like this - great subject matter, very nicely produced and some great art work, the rules sounded good. Seriously underwhelmed on first play (4 players) - so chaotic and random. It's all a bit of a lottery whether you pick the right units to attack/defend, as is whether other player attacks are more skewed towards your pieces than someone else.

I should really try it one more time but the first experience was so poor it might be hard to find the motivation.

Lots to like here - game play is smooth and seamless - no rules questions out of the box - good components - map areas big enough for all the pieces - brilliant player planning boards - good euro-war-game.

Hope to play again soon!

UPDATE: (July 24th, 2010) Played 2 more 4-player games today. Rating still a 9!

UPDATE: (July 31st, 2010) Played another 4-player game today - best game yet (finished second even) - still a 9.

Players represent one of the heirs to the throne in the Wars of the Roses.  Players work through a turn by drafting cards into their faction (cities, nobles, bishops, etc), drawing income, then secretly planning their turn.  Plots are revealed and worked through - moving nobles and ships around, attacking and defending across the board, and bribing persons over to your faction.  At the end of each of the five turns, you count up influence in the six regions and award victory points.  Victory points are also awarded for held titles - Captain of Calais, Warden of the Cinque Ports, etc.   Most victory points after five turns wins (i.e. becomes King).  Large, and lavishly produced game - you'd go a long way to see one as beautiful and sturdy as this one, and plays surprisingly smoothly despite the daunting rulebook.  Players are eased into the game nicely, by only having a few holdings and not much cash early to manipulate, but by turns 3, 4 and 5 there is a huge range of factors to take in, and the decision tree branches out rapidly.  Ponderers and AP prone players are likely to explode as they try to take it all in.   Beautiful looking game, and very well designed components that make game playing the game a pleasure.  Terrific theme (although not a particularly detailed study of the conflict ... bit like Wallenstein in this respect) ... and two hours of meaty, medieval gaming.

Material is wonderfull and design is quite cool. I expected a lot from this game and was so disappointed.

(As of [b]1[/b] play) Plantagenet England is one of my all-time favorite historical settings, so wild horses couldn't keep me away from this beautiful area control game. The simultaneous action phase involves a certain amount of second-guessing alongside resource management. Have only played this once, in a 2-player learning game that was almost too brain-burning to handle, but I feel there is a lot of potential here.

Wars of the Roses is effectively an elaborate shell for a lot of bluffing and double-guessing. Everything can be attacked or bribed away, and money puts a lid on what you can protect (which isn't all that much) so the results of the simultaneous planning phases can differ wildly, through no particular fault or feat of the players. A lot of money sunk for naught is just about as likely as wild swings of control all over the board.

If that doesn't bother you, the game is quite entertaining. It's also fairly short compared to similar games but maybe still runs a little long for the amount of chaos involved.

In its essence, it is a blind bidding area control game. But, the added thematic elements of the team cooperation, random distribution of nobles, castles, and bishops/ships add a layer of interest and flavor.  The order of execution of the actions add a layers of decision making.  It is a lovely game, beautifully over produced in every aspect.

Received this heavy-weight Feb 27, 2010. It weighed in at just under 10 pounds! Have really been anxious to see this one due to the great reviews. Now, will the game prove as good as the reviews?!
The bits are fantastic. I set it up, hardly believing the bits as I took them out of the box. It seems no expense was  spared to make this one special. The castles (player shields) are awesome with the inside walls of the castles summarizing the rules, and the floors serving as the individual planning boards. Everything is thick, weighty and well designed. Only quibbles - would like to have had the "Game Turn Summary" on the center panel rather than the right hand wall as that seems to be the most referred to part of the summaries; and wish the round cylinders were either discs or hex shaped, as they tend to roll around when knocked over. But those are minor quibbles in the most beautifully produced game I have ever seen!

Very nice components- solid & heavy. The rules make the game play look pretty easy to grasp- but gameplay leads to very heavy AP. The game seems to model well the many unkown situations that arose during these wars. Definitely best with 4. It's Diplomacy without the deal-making, in a sense. Too bad there isn't a variant to include deal-making (with a time limit?), as I think that would enhance this game. A beast as far as table space.

Update: sold. Can't see getting 4 players to sit around for 3-4 hours playing a game that features blind bidding/guessing for that long of a period. Too bad, because the components are superb. Also- the game is an area control game (which is fine) but the theme felt a little weak. Perhaps too much Euro for this type of game. Much prefer a game like Shogun in this area.

Had a lot of fun with this one and most players wanted to play again. The heart of the game is in the planning phase where you have a lot of options. You want to attack where you don't think players will anticipate an attack, you want to defend where there won't be multiple attacks, and you need to be able to figure that out. We played first game in 2 hours, could get it to 90 min as all players had not played. The area majority worked well. My main concern with the game is that the incentive to be behind in vp is too great and the catch up mechanisms are too strong. This may be mitigated with more experienced players. Looking forward to more plays.

After only one play, four players: less chaos than I expected. Bribing nobles or bishops is really expensive and we did not use this option but a few times. I knda liked it. Components are top noch, game flows really fast... a 7.5 but with a lot of chances of being an eight. Not a game for everyone, I agree that some players wont like it. Seems to be a game designed for four players I guess it will lost playability with less. Good impressions overall not a top favorite but could be a keeper, we will see in the incoming weeks.

A clever area control game with five basic things to do each round, but because of the simultaneous hidden planning there's no way one can predict the outcome of each round.

Some of the mechanics do not match the theme: blind bidding to see if you can move your troops for example.

Some aspects of the game could have had more theme added like having players draw from a specific faction deck instead of from a general deck.

The game isn't bad. It's just not as thematic as it could be and it's too long for a game that isn't thematic and that is only "not bad".

A very nicely produced game!  Excellent quality components.

Simultaneous action selection is what attracted me to this one.  Period feel is also pretty good.  Only thing missing is fun.  It's an area majority game brimming with chaos.  Everything can be "bought" so the limiting factor is money...

Problem is the "French Aid", which allows trailing players to get back in the game by providing them with money.  So, it rewards players for scoring low, by providing them with a large (up to $25) influx of money.  Money adds more flexibility/options, which in turn adds more chaos...

Unfortunately, French Aid is, IMHO, a game breaker.

If you keep your income mid-range for the first two turns, and your points low, you'll have an excellent chance at the win.  On the turn you receive the $20-25 cash influx, attack your opponents income base to essentially take them out of the game.

Imagine you are the leader, having concentrated on an economic strategy, and you are generating $23 a turn.  The player in last place has an income of $15, but a VP spread of 25 with first place...  He gets two good card picks (1st and 5th cards out of 8), AND an additional $25, bringing his income to $40 on that turn.  He then proceeds to attack your economic base.  Next turn you are generating 11, and he's at $40 again.  You are now relegated to the status of spectator, until your point spread allows you to benefit from French Aid...

So you want to keep your points low, in a game where it is rather difficult to predict just how many points you will be able to (not) generate.  This simply does not work for me.

Don't get me wrong, I am a wargamer at heart, and I like a good dose of chaos (dice, cards, etc.) but in WotR, it's over the top.


Ok, it's easy to complain and bicker, so how could we fix this?

How about adding TWO cards to the card row at the start of the turn, and allowing the player who's requesting French Aid to get the first two picks instead?  This would reduce the chaos produced by a sudden influx of $25, in a game already brimming with chaos.

If more than one player requests French Aid, then allow them to alternate picking their TWO bonus cards.

In the above proposal, the option to request French Aid should only be open to players with a point spread of 10+ with the leader.

My two cents.

Very keen to play this, and with the theme I can imagine being able to persuade my girlfriend into trying it

Played it - brilliant game. Seems a little daunting when you're first explained the rules but it's actually very simple and I reckon most casual players could pick it up.

Theres so many unknowns in the planning phase that it's really unlikely to be able to predict everything anyway so even top players can't rely on forsight.

I really do love this game. In terms of it being a game I think it deserves a 6, theres too many unknowns for it to be considered strategic in it's planning. It's totally not worth defending things because the defence is wasted if the defence is not needed. In this respect I would rather the game lasted more like 10 turns and any unused defence money was returned to you. This would work nicely as you would have to set aside funds in order to defend properly so still allows for a aggressive strategy - however then you would be looking at an epic 8 hour + game

As it is it desrves a 6 for its mechanics - theyre not going to be winning any awards any time soon and its impossible to plan strategically when you can only have vague guesswork about others moves.

As a story/modelling of the politics of the time however I love it. It's all about teamwork but also backstabbing at the correct moment. The throne will commonly change hands several times over the 50 years of the game and ultimately only one player will be crowned, so you should backstab your team-mate on turn 4/5

RATING: 9.5
Just upgraded to 9.5.  Played several games now and I think it is shaping up to be a classic.  There are so many excellent facets to this game that at some point I might have to write a proper review to do it justice.

The elements under your control are defined by three properties: influence, income and military strength.  Some are mobile (nobles, ships) and others are static (castles, cities and other settlements).  Military elements are only open to attacks by players with a local presence, but non-military elements are open to bribery which can come from any player at any time.  Thus, it is impossible to build yourself a "safe" corner of the map from which to expand and this gives the game a very tense, dynamic (often chaotic) feeling.

Money is necessary to perform actions.  In fact, since all money from a round is best spent immediately, money is effectively a variable action point system.  Combine this with simultaneous turn planning (like Diplomacy, but with each player using a shielded mini-map instead of a pen and paper) and an excellent "loose alliance" (partnership) mechanic in the 4 player game, not to mention a beautiful map of England/Wales, and this might end up being my favourite game!

A programmed movement euro/wargame hybrid vaguely reminiscent of both Wallenstein/Shogun and the ancient Kingmaker. It's all hugely chaotic, everything you have can be stolen at the whim of another player, and the game options narrow horribly for anyone who runs out of money (the French Alliance catchup mechanism doesn't quite work as it's one shot and doesn't provide income stream). If you accept that this is simply a knockabout then there's fun to be had for those interested in history, but there's no strategy that increases your likelihood of winning.

Okay, I had a pretty negative experience with this and I'm not sure if this was a weird circumstance or whether it's always like this (hence, I'm not rating it unless I play again).  One player decided to attack only me, every turn.  This took me out of the game, and prevented me from defending against future attacks, and I guess it was the right thing to do because he won, but, um, not so great actually.  Maybe this is a product of the partnership aspect of this game, which actually struck me as a somewhat clever mechanism, but, you know.  Ultimately, it's kind of a guessing game, but it would probably be better to play again and have a fair and reasonable opinion. (1 play)

I played it for my first time, with three people. It worked out well, but not as great as what I feel it would be for 2 or 4 people. It didn't have the intensity I expected it to have, but then again, we might not have been playing the roolz to a "T".

J'ai eu l'impression en préparant et en lisant les règles que lors de la conception le gars a dit à son boss je suis pas capable de mettre ça plus petit que ça.  Là son boss lui a demandé est tu sûr?  Et le chargé de projet qui est le beau frère du grand grand boss lui a dit oui.  Fait que son boss a donner le go pour la fabrication du jeu.  Mais enfin de compte il avait oublié le caps lock...

Le jeu est massif gros mais il y a de la place à mettre les choses sauf les jetons d'argent, carte, cube qui eux auraient dû avoir préscéance sur l'espace prise pour la planification des mouvements.  J'ai seulement fait un tour car je n'ai pas eu l'impression d'un jeu bien fait mais que pour l'apprendre en solo et d'y passer mon temps j'ai des jeux dont j'ai plus hâte de découvrir.  Je pense que j'aimerais mieux jouer une partie de warrior knight que ce jeu.

This is a great game. Definitely reminds me of El Grande and Wallenstein, but with more theme. It's area control, but I love that every specific thing you control has a name -- London, the Bishop of Exeter, the port at King's Lynn. The rules melt away after the first round. Plus it's just so pretty. 

I can see why it's not a huge hit on BGG -- gameplay involves lots of direct interaction and outguessing/doublethink. But I love that stuff. 

My only big knock on the game is that with its big main board and four big player boards, it's too big for my home table.

Normally I don't rate games after a single play, but this one gets high marks for the 4p. The choices are fun, the chaos evocative of the era, the loose "alliance" even more fun when e.g. both Lancastrians attack the same Yorkist castle on the same turn. I can't wait to get this to the table again. I may revise my rating after a 2p game.

RATING: 6
Great Components and theme.  The only randomness is the cards of what's available each turn, and yet it feels very random as you need to guess what you opponent(s) are going to do, without them guessing that you've guessed what they are going to do.

The game play is a bit similar to Shogun/Wallenstein, but without the cube tower thing, which suits me fine.

Played at Cancon, Canberra, Australia, Jan 24 2010.  As a long time wargamer and strategy gamer who has got more into Euros lately, I found this a wonderful game.  Turn processes got down very quickly.  Strategic options and choices were apparent to a newbie v quickly. Not that I could make the right choices!  Game is deceptively simple but has great depth and you really are playing the other players not the system.  Oh, and just love the graphics and the components.

Looks good, but is in essence an abstract area influence game similar to El Grande, married to the annoyingly chaotic simultaneous action selection mechanism from Wallenstein. No particular desire to play this again.

RATING: 7
Only one play, but I was impressed. A little bit stale and boring in the beginning, but very dynamic when the game moves on and a lot more possibilities open up to you. The turn order mechanism is interesting too, because you really want to have at least one turn when you're "losing," so you can take advantage of the French Aid and turn order perks.

RATING: 6.5
Secret planning plus area majority and a bunch of other ways to get points.  Real min/maxing stuff which I don't care for much but it does it all pretty smoothly if you like that kind of thing.  I just can't see a lot of scope for planning ahead - its seems like controlled chaos and someone emerges the winner but no-one is really sure why that person won.  The ride is quite fun though and I like second-guessing games and the theme is pretty well used.  I like the voting.  A massive improvement over the author's previous effort, Heads Of State, which also involves card drafting and area majority.  I guess I'm just not keen on area majority, except for AOE3.  My rating of 6.5 reflects a good, solid game which I will happily play.  Really, the game is not that heavy and should not take more than 2 hours - and only 90 mins with experienced players (who do not have secret planning analysis paralysis).

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3.5
The game puts too much focus on simultaneous planning. The amount of information and math is too overwhelming to use this kind of planning exclusively without causing AP. More flexibility should be offered.

Also there's not much room for playing solo. This should just be a team game.

The game can be very harsh as well. Failed or useless actions cost a lot of money for no reward. There should be some compensation.

Also the game is quite fast, surprised by the short length (maybe 2h at most)

RATING: 7.1
For all the choices you have in a turn, it seemed a little too chaotic to create any kind of tactics or strategy. Counter bribes are almost useless. Playing defensively seemed a great way to not only bore yourself to tears but also to come in last place.
I would be tempted to trade it but shipping cost (heaviest game I own), would probably cost more then buying it new.

Wars of the Roses is a highly chaotic game which might be valid as a representation of the period depicted but which is critical for a 2-3 hour game. It was fine with me but I may have a double bias of having bought the game and winning the play. I liked the soft alliance system and the simultaneous action planning. My hope is that better bluffing and double-guessing decides the winner and repeated play will show that the same players will win more often than not. The rest of my group tended to the opinion that luck/chaos will decide the winner and that there's too much effort up front for too few output in the end.

RATING: 9
Very nicely uses the historical backstory to create a tense area control game that's filled with flavor, scheming, warring and a neat semi-cooperative element. All this with a relative straightforward secret planning phase behind the coolest ever screens. You can turn secret planning into an exercise of outguessing, but that's called AP that doesn't pay off, the matrix of possibilities is too vast.  Avoids stacking contests and the turn order mechanism and French Aid make it very hard for the runaway leader.

Of all the new games I've played so far this year (2015), this is my favorite. Criminally underrated.  If you like second guessing your opponent's intentions and you like simultaneous action, this is the game you will love. Turns are so tense as you decide who to bribe and who to protect.  Money is so tight.  Looking forward to seeing how well this holds up to multiple playings.

I've played twice, and the second play confirmed my good opinion of the game.  Beautiful production, and as an old Kingmaker player, the theme is great.  The game clips along at a very good pace.  The long pauses for strategic thinking happen simultaneously, reminding me of Wallenstein.  I appreciate not having to wait sequentially for this thinking ( a la Java).  Overall the duration is good.  With rules explanation I would guess we spent 2.5 hours.  Making this a comfortable fit into an evening game slot.  

My only concern is that the game really needs exactly 4 players - players who like a war theme, but are okay with using Euro mechanics.

Not my kind of game. The secret planning phase is the core of this game and allows you to attack or bribe anything which has been build up. End result is pure chaos and no control at all. Basically requires to out-guess your opponents. Why bother? There are more than enough better games out there. *** Played once with three and won, but didn't enjoy the gaming experience.

This is a fun and QUICK war game based on calling each others bluff and predicting your opponents moves. Battle is quick with no added complications.

I purchased the game a week ago and played it with 3 friends this past weekend.  Two of the friends have since purchased the game for themselves so they can play it with other friends and relatives.

So, if you can find 4 people to play the game I don't believe you'll regret playing it.

The comments are based on a fast reading of the rules.

In summary, it looks like a game where all your movement and actions are hidden from the other player. The second important element is that almost everything on the board can be bribed. Which makes it some sort of area of majority and bidding game.

The idea that you can bribe many things could actually reflect well the kind of war that occurred during this period. But, it does not means that will I really find it interesting that half of my army changes allegiance every turn.

The second problem that I could see is that since the management is hidden and there is a lot of allegiance change, it should add a lot of fiddlyness to the game to manage all these details.

But I cannot say more because I did not actually played the game, but it really looks like an euro resource management game.

Very nice game about the power struggle in 15th century England consisting of attacking and defending cities and bribing bishops, ships and noblemen to switch sides. Actions are planned simultaneously, then revealed and resolved in turn order, which means that anything can happen and even though there are two teams consisting of two players each, there's nothing to stop team mates from attacking each other in their pursuit for kingship...

While this seems to be a war game, it is actually more a majority game (like El Grande), but a very interesting one I must say. Nice (heavy) material and a huge board makes the game sensation fabulous. Takes a bit long to handle all conflicts and most of the time you will be planning on your own board behind a heavy large screen. This game feels very similar to Diplomacy, but without the negotiation. 
I liked the team aspect in this very competitive game, where you can score points individually and in team with your "family member" (only in the 4 player version).

A lot of the game goes on in everybodies head during planning. So you must like that.

Nevertheless, a game you should have played as a board-gamer, and I promise you a positive surprise.

RATING: 6
The Princess Bride guessing game of will-he-still-make-the-obvious-choice-if-he-expects-me-to-guess-that-this-is-what-he’ll-choose can certainly work as the driving mechanic for short, loud, funny party games. If you want to incorporate it into more demanding games, you’d better scale down the risks of a wrong choice. A brilliant design like Race for the Galaxy might even allow you to choose your own comfort level of risk. A lacklustre and underdeveloped design like War of the Roses elevates it to the central mechanic without taking of the edges - here, a single unlucky choice can cost you more than half of your income for the round.

Couple this with an inelegant overflow of material, where the same information has to be stored on two different boards, and a severe handicap to the starting player, and you have yet another game that adds to the tedious tide of stuff that nobody’s going to play anymore in December this year. The only saving grace is the nifty way that the not-quite-team play of the two York and the two Lancaster contestants is handled.

After an inaugural play I am very excited about this one. I won the first game, but have no delusions of glory. My opponents, probably as a result of a poor teacher (me), misjudged the importance of income in the first turn. I jumped out of the starting gates with hefty lead. It was a hard lesson for them, but they learn quickly and my sizable lead was cut considerably by turn 5. I have been trying to temper my rating system and avoid knee-jerk 9s and 10s. This feels like a 9 to me right now...but I'll reserve judgement after another play or two.

Four player only. 

Very impressive production and some interesting twists on common mechanisms makes for a tense and thematic experience. 

A good game that is well-liked by many in my group. Unfortunately, it's just too long for me. I do like long games, but the basic hidden orders process is not something I can do for two hours solid. Like a more complex version of Revolution!, the majority of decisions are taken behind a screen as you try to second-guess what all the other players will do. So far, players I've found to be decisive forward planners have been reduced to the "no-wait-a-minute" AP kind of play, which is surprising. The sustained tension is much more draining to me than a long brain-burner with more open information.

I acknowledge that it's good, and that the theme is strong, but it's just never going to be a favourite with me.

RATING: 8
It's fun, thematic, different strategies to win & chaotic, especially as the game progresses, my kind of game really. It has a nice catch-up mechanism, so everyone is always in with a shot at the title too.

From the couple of games played so far, I must remember to keep an eye on the economics of the game, but then historically, without the money, the nobility were effectively hamstrung, even Edward IV who imposed a tax, raised money for an army but never used it for war because he needed it elsewhere.

Anyway, if you don't like area control games or you're the type to feel concerned about stabbing your ally in the back at the opportune moment, this game may not be for you.

I played Kingmaker a lot. This game is much more playable, but keeps the feel of this era. The secret planning superbly re-creates the fog of war and treachery of the times.

RATING: 6.5
Lovely-looking board, and an engaging theme. Quite wargame-like (in that you have to attack people to get anywhere). 

But the crux of the game is the simultaneous movement. This feels a bit like playing Diplomacy, but without the negotiations (indeed, the rulebook strictly forbids Diplomacy-style negotiations or deals, even between the 2 people supposedly on the same side!). And playing Diplomacy without negotiations can feel a bit like playing Rock, Paper, Scissors.

4-player game where two nobles of York team up against two nobles of Lancaster.  The alliances are soft (you can attack each other) but I wouldn't consider stabbing your partner's back until the very end of the game as working together will provide strong benefits.  It's mostly an area control game but new armies and areas are bid on before they come onto the board.  Bids and movement are decided secretly before each round and then once revealed war breaks out.  The production is top-notch, there's good fun with a bit of intrigue, politics and bluffing.

Finally got this one played and removed from my 'Pile of Shame'. Well worth the wait too.

This game has great production values which is complimented by some wonderful artwork and sturdy playing pieces.

The game plays very well and has a fair bit going for it. Bribery and counter bribery are key as well as anticipating what your opponent will do, where you are weak as well as keeping an eye on your 'ally' (in a four player game).

Several Euro mechanics are used to make this war/politics themed game a winner and it should appeal to a fairly broad cross-section of gamers.

I own this game, I'll keep it and would like to play it again. Highly recommended.

RATING: 7
An area control/resource management game about as Euroey as they come, but it beats other meaty feeling Euro area control games such as Game of Thrones hands down.

Its all about managing resources and predicting the movements of your opponents, with just a twist of cooperation from your partner (who is also still out to win).

I quite enjoy it, despite my usual distaste for both the area control and Euro categories, but then it also appears that I'm quite good at it which may bias my view a little!

It looks much less enjoyable when you are losing, and despite there being some reasonable catch up mechanics its possible for the winning player(s) to shoot well out of reach of the losers, making the game a bit of a spectator sport when you're not winning!

Its also prone to king making too, as with the semi cooperative element there's nothing to stop the loser of a pair throwing everything away to help their partner win just so they can feel like they had a 'moral' victory.

Exceedingly complicated to explain.

I admire people who can do well at this game and I admire the design from a technical standpoint, but the theme is wet paper thin and you can waste entire turns on bids if you choose badly.

I'm keen to try this game for three reasons: 
- a friend developed the artwork;
- I loved the thematic intent of Kingmaker although that game was usually frustrating because it frequently bogged down; and
- it reminds me of El Grande, which I love.

The rules look moderately complex, which doesn't bother me, but I'm not sure if it will appeal to most gamers I know.

Clever game which plays like a wargame/euro hybrid.

Soul of the game is in the hidden planning, which allows for almost anything to happen. Players must balance out attack and defence in both a military and a ownership (bribes) sense. Scoring is based on an area majority/minority mechanic and in addition when played with 4, both players in a team must combine their influence in each area to secure votes in order to control the puppet King!

A card draft is used to acquire holdings as the game develops and these offer command points and income. Income is super important in this game and the more the have the bigger the target you become.

Great game that offers an immersive experience and yet only takes experienced players 90 odd minutes.

Components and design features are first rate too. Does require a slightly larger than average table to accommodate.

RATING: 6.5
If you remember playing Kingmaker, the Avalon Hill game from the 70s, then this game will bring back a bit of nostalgia. The nobles and titles from Kingmaker are reintroduced into this game, but that is where the similarities end. 

Players draft cards consisting of nobles, towns, bishops or ships. Drafting is done in reverse order of who is winning the game.  Players then go behind their own player screen and plot their movement, bribe people or attack. Players either belong to the York or Rose faction, and your faction can gain more points if your faction controls more areas which adds some different dynamics. The French aid element supposedly helps those in the back, but this is a lazy game balancing mechanic in my mind. 

The game system is relatively clean, and very much unlike Kingmaker which had random card events. However, this game does rely on players being experienced and trying to rein in the leader, which is the mechanic I am not fond of. You could get picked on for no reason at all. Other than that, I do have mixed feelings on this game. I am fully engaged over the 2 hour period, but if you are unfairly attacked, it will make for a long game.

There are many layers in this game that have not been unearthed, despite the cruelty with which you can be unfairly attacked. However, the game relies on players to police who does well, and that overrides any clever mechanics that this game introduces. I'm not fond of the blind bidding for the Captain of Calais, or the attacks or bribery that favor the people behind on the VP track. I will play this game, but all you can do is try to have a general plan, and hope you don't get picked on while you go about your plan.

Z-Man has made some awesome games recently, but not this one. I'll likely never play it again. About 3 hours of random guessing where people will attack. Then if they don't attack there or if they do, all your troops go away. Not for me. The production value is A++ though.

One of the best-produced games I own. The board is gorgeous and the bits are very nice, but the player screens are unbelievably good.

The game is fascinating - tense and interesting all the way through. It combines simple wargaming and economics with bluff and huge toppings of guile. Very, very impressed.

Only complaint is that we need a bigger table!

I can't wait to play this again. Solid 8. Could go higher.

One 2-player game. Current 2-player version seems to strip out too much of the good meat of the game. System of gaining cities, nobles etc is interesting and I'll be looking forward to 4-player game. 
EDIT1. Played one 4 player game and it was much better. Deciding factor in the end seemed to be king crownings and some experience with the game. (Note to self: try to teach the basics of the system better :p)

RATING: 3.5
There is a lot of chaos. You are supposed to guess what your opponents are going to do, but there are far too many options to be able to do this, and even if there were only a few options, there's no way to know which they'll take. 

This is a problem because if multiple people happen to choose to attack the same area or bribe the same noble, someone gets screwed. IIRC, the first attacker pays a heavy price, then the second one just walks in and gets all the benefit, which I especially dislike - it's so chaotic that it's effectively random. 

This kind of second guessing mechanic works well in Hoity Toity (a light 30-45 min game with 2 or 3 options at each decision point), but IMO is not suitable for a game that takes all evening.

RATING: 6
It's area control over 6 areas, with roughly 7 things in each area that can be "bought", controlled, lost to other players, some moveable, etc, and these provide control points. Most control points in an area get VP's. Play and score 5 rounds. Control is Wallenstein / Shogun like, ie secret orders, with the difference being here you can pretty much whack anyone anywhere. There's no negotiation allowed, so "accidental" ganging up can happen, but there's a big catch-up mechanism. As a result, it turns into an indiscriminate whackfest and the result was pretty much a lottery in the final round. It's for those who like that kind of thing. My take is that one should never incorporate lots of planning downtime with chaotic whackfests - you end up not satisfying either type of gamer.

I just love this game! It's a treat to look at, the oversized components make it a lush piece in the collection. The board is great, simple design which keeps things easy to follow. During the game, as more and more components enter the board, the whole scenario just increases in beauty! The game is always tense since you never know what will happen and you must always think one step ahead. Try to grab from those who want to take from you, make value increased exchanges and cling to those bits that will earn you victory! This game is a must in any collection, even if you wouldn't like to play it, just setting it up and looking at it... how could one resist?? You can't! It put a spell on me! *blush*

- The rule book is very well written, it's not too extensive, big enough caption, loads of examples with illustrations that leave no doubts! Really very nice!

RATING: 7.5
Based on one play: At its base this is an area control game. There are six regions and you are fighting to the the most influence in each one as first place and second place will score points each round. However the way to get control is not so easy. You each claim different characters or locations and then move them around or try and bribe others. All this is done in secret and then you reveal simultaneously so you have no idea whether your plan will work out. It is frustrating and chaotic but a lot of fun as you must take risks and not only plan your moves but anticipate others. Will definitely play again.

RATING: 7
This is a really interesting team area control game, with hidden planning. The combine well into a mix that has you trying to guess what your opponents will do as much as your team mate, since no team planning is allowed. This combined with limited resources creates a tension every turn, where you try to only use resources where you really need them. It can be highly frustrating if you spend a lot of money defending a town that nobody attacks! It can be a bit fiddly at times due to the way the planning board works, but not so much that it spoils the pace of the game. The team aspect is great encouraging you to work together with your team mate until a key moment where you have to ensure that you take the victory on your own. My only real issue with the game is that you need four players for the game to be at its best, which is not always the easiest thing to arrange.

As strange as it might sound, this game is like Diplomacy without the negotiation.  At the start of each turn, you issue a set of orders, then everyone reveals their orders simultaneously and executes them.  However, it is expressly forbidden to talk to each other while drafting orders.  So it's basically a guessing game: you're trying to figure out what your opponents will do and come up with moves that will block or take advantage of them.  There are other parts of the game (like building up an economy), but that part was the heart of it.  I'm terrible at backstabbing so I didn't miss the negotiation, but it's still simultaneous action selection.  Plus, it's all about direct conflict, which I don't really go for either.

A well designed seemingly balanced game, weaving the politics, treachery and divisions of the wars of the roses into a tense, simultaneous game engine. Whilst not easy to teach initially and you really need the right people; when it all comes together on the table you feel your blood rising as armies march around you, cities fall and nobles switch sides. The large amount of cardboard gold is nice too

Played the draft mechanic incorrectly after each turn and thus fell way behind, but I'm not sure there was much my partner and I could have done.  Would like to try again to see if the game is more dynamic.  As it played out in our game, the folks who were behind had to concentrate forces on one attack in order to win, then watched all other weakened holdings lose out to balanced attacks from the opponent.

Not bad, but not great either. Very nicely produced, though. A bit chaotic and suffers from the same issue as any blind bidding game, except this is much longer than most (so the issue becomes a problem). If you're behind and you don't make real progress with your use of French aid, you're fucked.

An exquisitely produced area majority game. I don’t think it’s perfect - the simultaneous planning phase inevitably introduces a lot of luck and chaos - but I had a great time playing it. I like the way new holdings are introduced by card drafting so that each game will be quite different, I like the semi-partnership aspect, and the bonus of the simultaneous planning is that there isn’t nearly as much down-time as there can be in games like this. I’m not sure about the strong catch-up mechanisms, they almost feel too much, although in our game I took a huge early lead and nearly held on to it. If you can cope with a large dose of bluffing then WotR is well worth a go.

First game impressions very good. This feels like a solid area control game with good screwage. There is a lot going on to wrap your mind around and it will take a few games to really see how to screw your opponent's plans. 
May be prone to AP in later rounds as you do the VP computations in your head for each area, so beware of AP players. Definately looking forward to more plays.
Components are just great, it looks fantastic.

An elegant area control, hidden movement engine makes for some tense moments. In four player, you have a loose team mate that each of you can benefit from working together against the other team but only one of you can win the game. Most innovative part of the design is the ability to catch up funds that can only be triggered once per player per game and is based on how far behind you are. 

Production is top notch - pounds of gaming goodness.

I wouldn't really call this a game, but rather a means of passing time.  It is extremely chaotic, and virtually impossible to plan any strategy which achieves anything useful, as everyone else is doing things which completely disrupt everything you do.   
Basically you just pick some things to do, and then see the results, which end up just being random.
Too much randomness and too chaotic.

First play 10/2010 did not disappoint, but did not quite enchant either.  I really like the freedom of movement on the board, and the variety of strategies that are available.  Difficult decisions, which I always like.  While you can tell who is going to do well in the next few turns, it seems almost impossible to stop an economic powerhouse.  I'm starting at 8, and think that (like Imperial) this rating may rise with more replays.  My sense is that it may be possible to get so frighteningly good at this game that it isn't even fun to win anymore.

I have conflicting views of this game: 

On the one hand, it has complex, yet easy to grasp mechanics that I find reasonably well balanced and interesting AND it's semi-coop multi player element provides an interesting psychological turning point in the late game. 

On the other hand, it suffers from information overload, giant table-eating components and analysis paralysis AND an early lead (in turn 1) is not always possible to overcome, which makes the game's 2 hours feel like a forgone conclusion…

Ultimately, I think this game works best with 2 players, where a player can't simply be crushed by the overwhelming attacks of 3 opponents.

Ultimately, I enjoy playing the game but I do fid it frustrating, too long and generally would rather play something else.

March '10: Only played once at Tom's.  I'm not a blind draw fan and the prediction of "best" play was tough because the ships and nobles can move.  But otherwise, I thought it was a very cool game.  The forced alliance was a new treat.  And I like the end of round bonuses (sort of like trade goods, etc. in Age of Empires).  In the end, it's too chaotic for me so I won't be buying it but I would definitely play it again.
*best tip: putting coins on top of money when bidding in order to keep things straight.

Interesting game, but not sure that in a 4 player game, whether all the mechanics work as they should.  It certainly seems to favour a highly aggressive play style.
Have been recommended to try a 2 player which perhaps ebbs and flows more as the designer expected.
Personally, in a 4 player game, you are left with too many choices when considering defence, but perhaps that's just me.
Overall, after 1 play, it was an enjoyable, AP experience.

I'm doing something I rarely, maybe never, do. I'm rating this one after only 1 play. It was the perfect synthesis of the theme and scope of Kingmaker constrained down into a Euro-Style game. And yet, the production quality of the best there is.

And it was fun! I came in last, because of an unexpected and Target Tattoo Painting early lead at the end of turn 2. I was everybody's goto guy for the rest of the game.

And still, it was a blast, and will be thrilled when I get to play it again.

NOTE: After three plays, this is still a solid 9, a nearly perfect game experience.

RATING: 6
Area control game with lots of moving bits.  Seems to favour the attacker more than the defender in that initial plays feel like there is little risk in just going balls out and attacking/bribing/converting others rather than protecting your own resources.  Granted first play was 3P with everyone for themselves.  I suspect that 4P with the alliance might change that dynamic a bit.

But still a game of pacing and timing as the early lead can be poisonous and debilitating as the game goes on.  Plays surprisingly quickly as the turns aren't all that long.  Once the planning phase is done, the rest is relatively quick.

RATING: 8
Great theme, even better components. My main gripe about the theme is that there are no battles! When it comes to game play, you're largely relying on guess-work by the end. There are simply too many variables. I don't mind an ample amount of blind bidding and bluffing: in such situations I like to apply a psychological approach, but with this game that's very difficult because of the chaos of the endgame. Nevertheless, an interesting  and enjoyable experience.

The most realistic "wargame" I have played ever. No sugar coating here: Enemy armies location unknown, targetted towns unknown, loyalty of nobles uncertain. You must fight the Wars of the roses just as York and Somerset had to in 1455. The has new and clever mechanics for simultaneous movement and resolution. Minimal downtown for a wargame and I was rivotted from start to finish.

Great board and pieces. Becoming one of my top ten games.

I really wanted to like it, but it's bad. You blindly assign armies for the defense of your cities and attack on the others. You can't defend everything, and if you guess wrong where you'll be attacked and with what force, you lose the city. My game was decided purely based on luck.

RATING: 9
Rated after 2 4-player and 2 2-player games. 

So it's an area control euro 'disguised' as a historical wargame. Works for me. The disguise is well effected, without compromising the game's very clear and straight forward euro roots. Simultaneous planning makes for plenty of tension, and so far each game has played out very differently. 

Particularly like the way factions work in 4 player - you can never quite trust your 'ally', but your interests will often be thrown together. 

As for the 'glorified rock-paper-scissors'criticism - well, out-thinking your opponents and making calculated guesses is critical, and creates uncertainty without the randomness of dice rolling. A clever, elegant design. With a minimum of rules too, the game should be very accessible to people without much board-gaming experience.

Top-notch components, as one comes to expect from Z-man.

Curious choice for cover art, though. I get that the design is Australian, but Ayers Rock seems an unusual backdrop for mediaeval England.

...and probably a 9 with four players.  A neat mix of standard systems with a little element of bluff mixed in.  There are some confusing aspects but not enough to derail the experience.
As has been often noted, this is what Kingmaker would have been with the benefit of 30 years of systems development.  And that's meant as a compliment.

We had 2.5 hours to play from scratch - no-one knew the rules and the rulebook looked thick and daunting. However, within an hour we had finished turn 1. The quick rules sheet is sufficient keep the game moving without too much reference to the rulebook.
We got to the end of turn 3 in the time allotted but would certainly get this finished in the same 2.5 hours next time.
It's a game of bluff and outwitting your opponents. It's a bolted on theme but works nicely. Lovely production but you need such a big table!

[1 play] This was great! Bewildering at first - what to do, how to do it, and why. But then the fog lifted for us all and it turns out that this was a fun and easy game of warfare and intrigue with a modest team element for four players. I will easily raise my rating to 9 or 10 depending on how this plays with 2 or 3 - although it seems designed optimally for 4.

Think of it as a planning mechanic like Wallenstein, area control conditions pioneered by El Grande, and some of the delightfully chaotic simultaneous maneuvering and combat found in a Game of Thrones.

played twice at the Australian Games Expo, once with designer Peter and graphic designer Ben explaining the rules.  I was leading early in the game but fell behind around 3rd and 4th age but managed to catch up on the last round to come second only behind by a point.

Second game we played, I was much more confortable with the rules, and my team lead the game from front, winning most of the majorities after and managed to finish 1 and 2.. again I was behind only by 1 point.  I do like the team element and little cooperative element in the game, 5 points per round for the winning house is pretty decent incentive.  In the end though you can never truly trust your partner, so there is constant double guessing.  I do not enjoy simultaneous move selection in the game but this wasn't too bad.. still there were some times where you are just waiting for others to finish planning their move while you are just doing nothing.. bit prone to AP and nothing you can do about it. otherwise fine game.

5 for game play 10 for components, effort and love.

Play is far too Min/Max with added pain of blind bidding.

However, it looks so stunning that i will play it again and maybe i'll end up liking the game play.

I hope that having less assets in 4p than 2p will make up for the blind bidding and the neccasary second guessing.

With 4 good fun, Chaotic and a guessing game, but who cares as it is a blast

two parts of the rules of this mis themed Euro got my goat. The first was that players are ‘Power brokers’ in 15th Century England – my first reaction was what like the Earl or Warwick? What exactly is a power broker? It’s not a question that needs asking in Kingmaker, or Richard III but it does in ‘War of the Roses’- The second part that had me reaching for ‘Kingmaker ‘(a game where theme and mechanics sing from the same hymn sheet) is the rules that, whilst players are either Lancastrian or Yorkist they can’t actually communicate with each other. So let’s imagine the Battle of Bosworth then, perhaps the Yorkist’s lost so miserably because their leaders were reduced to playing charades to coordinate strategy. So i can just see Richard III dressed up in plate mail waving his arms frantically ( Marcel Marceau style) to the Duke of Norfolk   and Earl Northumberland.  Northumberland scratches his head looking bemused ‘Whats that Dickie? Three words, Rhymes with tank? Oh you mean Flank....too late its gone’.

This game has more blind choice than I'd like. I'm not against blind choice in limited ways, like when you choose event cards in Hammer of the Scots, but when [i]everything[/i] is blind - purchases, movement, attacks, bribes and counterbribes - and the whole thing revealed at once, it feels too much like a crapshoot.

Other than that, I like the game reasonably well. It moves at a good pace and can be fun, but considering the available alternatives, I'd be hard pressed to recommend it to a wargamer. For a eurogamer who wants a taste of history, it would be a good choice.

After several more plays I have had to up my initial rating to 9.

I love everything about this game. The components and artwok are phenomenal, probably the best I have ever witnessed in a Euro.

The words Simple and Elegant cover everything about this game.

The rules are perfectly laid out, perfect length and left no issues uncovered.

There are numerous layers that take it beyond the average area control game. I particulary like the bribery aspect of the planning phase. Personages in each region can be paid off to stay loyal, switch sides, counter bribed and the furthest behind player in the game can jump in with another bribe which will win when if a loyalty bonus was cancelled by a previous bribe.
Add in the bonuses to be earnt from various collections of Ports, Castles, Bishops and Tradeship Captains and combinations of Bishops and Cathederal Cities and Ports and Captains and you have a winning game that feels simple to play and boils down to the many secret choices you make in the planning stage.

It's worked well  with 2 and 3 players but I suspect that it would be best with 4, as there is an extra twist. There is a small 2 versus 2 co-operative bonus to be earnt each round which would make for a very interesting partnership game, though the games terms of victory is ultimately: every man for himself.

I could eaily see this scoring a perfect 10 for me, especially after more 4 player games.

RATING: 5.75
I really like the whole "partnership but not partners" aspet of this game, where two people are on a team and get bonus VP if they "work together" but only one can win.

We did play the game with a LOT of wrong rules, so my verdict might change (could be worse from the fact you can't actually double protect or double bribe someone). Still, it is good, just a little too chaotic with the blind bidding and card drafting for me to really enjoy. Plus I'm not interested in the theme at all.

I have played many times and every game is different. I prefer the 3 players version, no unexpected attacks by my ally. It taught me a lot of english history;fascinating period of history. Look out for treachery nobles.

Quel matériel! Et quel thème! J'ai beaucoup aimé - encore plus à 4 - et j'ai bien hâte de rejouer pour savoir si l'attaque pur est la façon de gagner (il semble difficile de se défendre).

Despite the chaos, I enjoyed War of the Roses: Lancaster vs. York. Outguessing your opponents is a big part of this one, and leader-bashing is likely, but skill does seem to win out despite all of that. Money (and thus the ability to bribe nobles and hire troops) is critical in this one ... fall behind in income and it's very difficult to come back. I can't see this game hitting the table often, given its longish play time, but it's definitely a keeper for that one or two times a year when a monster game of this sort is possible. As a side note, this game, if not the heaviest I own, is certainly the most dense. The weight when picking the game up never ceases to amaze!

RATING: 9.5
Great game and great depth. You must consider very carefully each card draw (where your faction will grow) and whether you need Castles for strength, large towns for money or powerful nobles and Bishops. Getting the balance right is the skillful aspect of this game. Love the tension of the four player game. Best quality game in terms of production that I own.

Nicely done implementation of the theme, a bit too many pieces of information to hold in your head at once when planning your turn for my liking.  Preferable to its obvious ancestor Wallenstein. UPDATE: I enjoyed this an awful lot more as a 2-player.  Rate an 8 for 2P and a 6 for 4P.

I can't tell if this game is just pure chaos or not.  It's definitely unique and a little hard to explain to people.

The components are pretty awesome.

It pretty much requires 4P to play properly.

The most overproduced game ever- and I love it! The components are absolutely delicious, from the player screens to the troop counters and right through to the board itself. The gameplay is chaotic but solid with a lot of time spent on simultaneous planning each turn. I have played the 2P version so far (which ended in a draw...), but this game has been designed specifically with 4 players in mind. I can see that it would excel when four players are present. 

Having now played the 4 player version I can say that this game is excellent when a time limit is enforced in the planning phase. Otherwise it draaaaags.

Phew a 4-player game of Wars of the Roses is a chaotic, tense adrenaline-filled experience. Not much strategy involved but much tactics, bluffing and double bluffing. An epic feel to a game that plays in less than 2 hours is rare to find. And the production value of the game is very high with beautiful components. Highly recommendable!

Wonderful system.  Never know what's going to come up or who is doing what each turn.  We've played multiple games in our Monday night group and the Earl of Warwick has yet to be an available card.  Just plain weird there.

RATING: 9.5
Refreshingly different. Innovative game mechanisms with lots of tactical decision making. A balance between noble power, defensive strength of locations and income from towns the church and shipping is needed. The bribery mechanic is great and fits historically. Beautiful components from Z-Man Games here.

Really nice bits and nice game design too.  I played my first game against die-hard wargamers, and managed to pull off a win (my partner wasn't too happy when I mistakenly attacked one of his ships!) It's said to be a light version of King Maker, which I have yet to try. After playing once I ordered it without a second thought.

Journey back to England, 1450, just prior to the outbreak of the bitter civil war between the Royal Houses of Lancaster and York. Henry VI, a Lancastrian, was proving to be a weak ruler, so the wealthy and ambitious Richard, Duke of York, looked to put things right. The powerful noble families had to choose sides and over the next 40 years, kings, royal heirs, and great nobles were to die, in what was to become known as the Wars of the Roses. Players take on the role of Lancastrians and Yorkists, who must gather support from the major towns and powerful noble families and attempt to control the royal castles throughout the country. Ports, the shipping trade, and financial aid from the Church and France are also needed. As their faction grows in strength, players vie for the King’s favor and look to earn the prestigious titles of Captain of Calais, Archbishop of Canterbury, Warden of the Cinque Ports, Lord High Admiral and Constable of the Tower of London. Money means power, because loyalty can be bought, so players should be prepared for the inevitable treachery as nobles change allegiance at crucial times, affecting the balance of power. When Parliament is called, each region in England will support one or other of the two Royal Houses and the crown will go to the one with the greater power base. Nobles loyal to this House will be rewarded by a grateful King. Eventually, only one Royal House will boast the King, but the player who has gathered the most money and prestige will win, regardless of his allegiance.

Good fun in trying to outguess your opponents.  You can go from hero to zero, as I have sadly found out, but the game really rewards forward planning. (or lack thereof).  Mean and nasty, but fun!

Essentially it's lots of simultaneous blind auctions. I don't much care for blind bidding in serious games as a general rule, and having to conduct many at once makes it worse.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Wars Of The Roses is essentialy a blind bidding strategy game which revolves completely around estimating what you opponents will be aiming for next round. You only play a couple of rounds (6 or 7 I believe), but the game still takes around 2,5 hours with 4 because of all the moving parts and foward planning. That may not sound very appealing, but I really enjoyed my game with four players. Because of the guessing and double guessing control is limited, but the game is just very atmospheric and suspenseful. Do not need to own, however, because I can see how you really need to have 4 players to play, and also because of its length.

This game has had quite a few plays now and has proven itself to be an excellent euro.  I bought it thinking it might be a wargame, but it most definitely is not.

I like Euros, so I have no problem with this.  The game involves a lot of blind bidding, bluff and educated guesswork.  Failing to read your opponents strategies will result in you taking a beating.

Looking forawrd to playing many more times.

This is a good game but it probably could have been more thematic without adding too much. I would recommend a variant to enable some better catch up mechanisms. The rules favor giving advantages to players that don't need them. I would either reverse the card draft to begin with the last player or proceed in the actual turn order (instead of the reverse as stated in the rules) when resolving combat and bribes.

Obviously inspired by [gameid=987], but way better, which isn't really saying much, as Kingmaker is a real stinker.  This is a real puzzle of a game.  It feels very dense, but I'm not completely convinced that it isn't, at heart, an overly obtuse affair that ultimately is settled by who got attacked the least.  There are big swings, particularly with the French aid, which is nonetheless needed to keep people in the game.  The thematic ties are very good, particularly with the factions simultaneously cooperating and competing.  I also like the high variance from different cards coming out every game.  This one niggles at me, and I would play it again, but I'm not sure if it's going to get brought to my game group again.  It might end up consigned to the dusty corner of played once and forgotten.

Highly underrated game that is indeed full of rich and interesting decisions to be made. Very nice (and heavy lol) components making it an appealing purchase, yet the only flaws maybe on the card drawing mechanism is indeed a bit strange
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Extremely chaotic but fun.  I really love simultaneous action selection and secret movement as mechanics, and this game is all about that.  The only problem, from my perspective, is that the decision space isn't constrained enough to produce the double-think/bluffing depth these games often have.  The result is that when things go right or wrong, you end up feeling lucky or unlucky, rather than clever or fooled.  If there were more differences amongst the regions, nobles, towns, etc. I think it would help this, since there would then be more significant focal points to plot around.

Those complaints aside, the game is a lot of fun.  Even if it's chaotic, it's still fun to hem and haw, reveal, look around your opponents boards, and then whine about how you almost had it set up this other way, which would have been way better. :)

Dit spel is eigenlijk te complex om hier even kort samen te vatten. Spel heeft wel iets weg van Game of Thrones (wat weer gebaseerd is op de rozenoorlog), maar focussed meer op een meerderheden systeem dan daadwerkelijk direct conflict. De achterbaksheid komt wel goed naar voren in het omkopen van edellieden en bisschoppen voor jouw zaak.

Heeft jammergenoeg wel een geforceerd mechanisme van hulp om achterblijvers te steunen om het spel in evenwicht te houden. Dit is wel jammer.

Finally got this game to the table late 2012 after falling flat on first play. Table was split as whether there is too much 'chaos' and not enough 'control'. I'm more in the having to ride the chaos (much like dominant species - except I seem to do this much better). You can't keep hold of everything, you have to make the decision, what's important to me to take/hold onto.
One player noted that the rich get richer once you get behind financially. So looks like something to keep an eye on for next game.

The many raves about the components have verified my long-standing suspicions: Z-Man coats its boards in uncut psychedelics.  Hence the waxy feel.

It's one turn too long, but most Z-Man game are at least ten turns too long - so not bad, I guess.

A great game of politics and battles.  Simple rules that capture the feel of political maneuvering, switching allegiances, and hidden movement of your troops.  Always tense as you wait to see where everybody decided to go.  The rules pretty much force you to be aggressive because you can't win if you try to play defensively.

2 players is just too much thinking for my small brain.  Rounds 1-3 it was fun trying to outmaneuver my opponent.  Round 4 I was okay with it because I had an obvious simple strategy.  When round 5 came along I was tired of it.

I suspect with 4 players this will be much more interesting and less exhausting.

Do you think this is a wargame? No, it is the euro in the vast and heavy box with a fairly simple rules. 5 turns you arrange a blind auction on a huge map, and then get points for supremacy on the ships / forts / regions. The main problem is not a majority, but that the main mechanics of this huge game - a bluff. For a card game in 20 minutes would be enough. For a 3-hour colossus - no.

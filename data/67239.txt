Good game!
Usually tight finish, and has easily understood victory conditions.
Because of frequent gold payments, game is both less luck & trading dependent compared to vanilla Catan.
In many ways, better then all other Catan games-except for:
There is only one way to win.  Even though there are multiple strategies to get there, this should severely limit re-playability.
This really is a very good game, I just prefer deeper games personally.

I like the game, but oh boy, do I ever have to be in the mood for it. It's long and intense, and people get grumpy if the roles don't go their way! But it's definitely fun and has a lot of good mechanisms, and I also enjoy the differences between it and normal Catan.

The idea is super, building the trains across America. I like how the board changes as the cities spread. a nice switch from catan, a bit heavier.

RATING: 7
A surprisingly decent re-implementation of Catan. The emerging trade network for delivering cubes driven by the Catan resource game is pretty interesting. Honestly, the one thing that holds it back the most is that it still has the robber (outlaw) from vanilla Catan. The overly annoying completely luck driven robber mechanic makes me want to rate it just 6, but I will look the other way and rate it 7 anyway I guess. The theme is fun and it's a fresh way to play Catan.

TERRIBLE GAME - NEVER BUY THIS (GenCon 2010). This takes the worst elements of Settlers of Catan and Train Building games and makes for one of the longest, most tedious, most boring things you will ever do with your three hours (in a 3 player game).

Played once at London on Board. Very different from standard Settlers with some other interesting mechanics and more to think about. A little long for its weight, with four players all new to it, at least. Would be interested to try again, perhaps, but not desperate to.

RATING: 4
Played with the recommended starting layout, we found this to be be distinctly un-euro despite all its 'Settlers' influence.  Single path to victory, tediously repeated for each settlement, drawn out over double the hours its advertised for.

Way to Americanize it, Klaus.

(May adjust rating if I learn we played things wrong.)

I loved it! Got to play a demo and teach a demo of it too. I never played Settlers of Catan yet, but I now understand it (read the Catan rules) I liked the mixed of the train and Catan. (Seen people play it) It's like Ticket to ride meets Settlers of Catan.

The thing I didn't like it there wasn't enough gold and I didn't like the fact that the slabs missed the buying resource limit that the printed slab had, because we ended up paying more attention to the slabs and forgetting the limit.

This is a game we just bought and I have only played it a few times so far, but what I love so far about this game is that it combines the greatest parts of Settlers with a Ticket To Ride twist.  My husband gets frustrated when playing the original Settlers with me because he chooses to settle in the wrong areas and then gets frustrated when he cannot acquire his resources.  He also refuses to trade to help himself because he fears that he will also help me.  LOL  In Settlers of America, there is an alternate method of acquiring resources (buying with gold) so he is happy and more willing to play.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I might prefer this to Settlers, but have not played enough to know yet.  It is certainly longer than Settlers, but I don't mind longer games.  The gold when you get nothing else part is a big deal, and if original Settlers plays well with a similar house rule, that might be even better.  This is because, counter to that upside, Rails does feels like one has a little less freedom in anything meaningful.  Trading seems to happen less, resulting in your hand dictating somewhat strictly your route of play.  Still, it is a fun enough ride, with some true control.

I really enjoy settlers because it is about making the best use of the resources you have to get points and there are different ways to get to 10 points & win.

With this game you MUST do everything except cards to win and in the end game if you don't have coal you WILL NOT win.

I thought it was OK but not great.

As with most Catan games, the players are at the mercy of the dice (luck), but SoA:Rails to Trails adds some nice twists without losing too much flavor from the original S.o.C.  Unfortunately, the game is too long.  The focus of this game is to produce cubes (by making settlements) and then to use your rail network to deliver your cubes.  The catch is that each city/settlement can only be delivered to once in the entire game.  I like this pick-up-and-deliver mechanic, and I also like the way that rail (road) building is the reverse of the original S.o.C.  Here, you want to connect to your opponents' cities because you cannot deliver cubes to your own cities.  I also like the gold coin "consolation prize" when you don't produce anything on a resource die roll.

A very approachable pick-up-and-deliver game that uses the tried and true Catan mechanics. I think anyone that enjoys Settlers of Catan will enjoy this as well. It's easy enough to play, but different enough from it's big brother to afford a unique play experience in a familiar setting.

RATING: 7.25
Enjoyed this game much more on second play than the first.  The game is faithful to the original which is always good and introduces some new elements but not too many to change it up too much.  The one problem we had with it is that it took a long time to play.  3 hours plus.  Even with some rule clarifications and some player distractions this is still a really long game.  We will have to try some house rules, maybe just limiting the cubes to be delivered will be enough.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Refreshing ideas (goods delivery, having to build your cities to free goods cubes, gold as compensation etc.), but still a Settler game.

Playing time is  little too long, for what it delivers.
In the late game, with lots of settlements, the overview in the production phase sufers a little.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
The designer has taken a game with elements of steam and overlaid it on a Settlers backbone.  And then compounded the randomness by having hexes stop producing as the game goes along.  So randomness of the dice mixed with the chaos of an ever changing board and I'm supposed to plan?  At least the money purchases are mitigating.  But overall, no thanks.

I actually quite like the concept of this game, but it is so incredibly poorly paced.   The game is far too long, and it just drags on and on at the end.

Good Settlers game.  Much more going on than regular SoC with a fun element of balancing expansion with goods delivery.  Nice to see the old luck-reducing "food stamps" variant included in this game as a standard rule (the gold chits).  Unfortunately it has the same problem as Settlers of the Stone Age: it takes a long time to play - longer than I can usually tolerate in a Settlers game, hence the "6" rating.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A superior game to regular Settlers of Catan. For one, the board doesn't fall apart when you're playing with it because it's not modular. But some of the best things about this game are the openness of the board and the addition of money. Being able to collect money when you receive no resources makes the game much less frustrating, and the spacious board fixes the original game's issues with crowding. The  pickup & deliver element of the game also creates more player interaction and just makes it more interesting. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A bit on the long side, but generally engaging throughtout, and the fairly high level of production for most of the game makes the longer playtime more acceptable. I liked it, it's a clever variant. It's a shame it's not 20 minutes or so shorter, it's not as tight a game as Fall or Rome or Germany, but it does score points for being a more involved, larger-scale variant that works pretty well (Stone Age, for example, didn't), and it's a good thematic blend of ideas from various Settlers sources.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I thought the mechanisms here were very cool and made for a much different feel than regular Settlers, although much of the same basic engine is used.  The whole idea of sending out settlers to plant cities, and then building rail networks to deliver goods to those cities was very neat!  It also made for a different feeling win condition, which is delivering all of your goods before the other players.  It made for some very interesting decisions; when to expand your cities to increase your production vs. when to deliver a good before someone else makes the delivery.

However, I felt like it went very long for what it is, especially in a four-player game where there's a fair bit of downtime.  It's still, at it's core, Settlers of Catan, and I'm just not sure I'm going to want to play a 2-hour Settlers very often.  So, in the end, I would say it's a very cool game, there's just too much of it to be a game I would want to play very often!

Best with 4, okay with 3

Uses the base mechanisms of engine building and trading of Catan, but with a completely different feel.  The addition of Rails/trains for goods delivery, and Settlers for city building make a focus on network building far above that of the original.  While it is not possible to fully block someone as you can in Catan, you can force your opponents into suboptimal networks that make the chances of winning impossible.  Network building and trading are the key here.

Nice mix of Settlers and a Train game.  I like the elements in the game that promote settlement to the west (free tracks, bonus gold, and moving resource numbers).  Also good that you never get hosed on resources, picking up at least a gold if needed.  Lots more decisions to make though ultimately you need to get your settlements founded and your trains running.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
I'm not a big fan of Settlers to begin with, but I like what they've done here.

The gold mechanic seems to work pretty well.  I also like that you get a scrap if the dice are unkind to you (and you aren't getting anything else).

I'm a little concerned that the obvious strategy of building settlements as fast as you can to get access to more resources (and to bleed off the movable numbers from the East) is really the only winning strategy. But the game is too long and not rewarding enough to get a high number of plays to confirm this suspicion. 

I'd be willing to play again, but probably would prefer it not to be terribly frequently.

Pretty decent version of Settlers. The idea that you have to deliver goods to get vp, and each city can only accept one goods cube, means that you can't just boom your economy like in previous Settlers. Otherwise, all the "easy" cities to get to will be delivered to, and it will be much more work to deliver to cities on the fringes. Similar to the TTR:M to TTR change. It does feel like it's almost too easy to create new settlements though, as you don't need any roads for your settlers to travel on, and one (each) wheat gets them up to three spaces away from where they're created. There is a nice migration feel, kinda like Settlers of the Stone Age, without quite as extreme evaporation of resources of SotSA.

A superior derivative of Settlers of Catan. Keeps the empire building aspects, and adds a network building mechanic. Players have access to many more resource hexes than in the original, so randomness is smoothed out. It comes at the cost of less player-to-player trading, but the rest of the game makes up for it.

Bought this new, likely for about $40 from Indigo.  Part of the Catan Histories line of games.  (Darryl Thiessen has Struggle for Rome.  And there is one other game in the series that neither of us has - yet.)

RATING: 8
Good adaptation to the original game. It introduces gaining gold when no resources are collected on a die roll. Which really helps if your initial placements didn't cover as many numbers/pips as an opponent. It also brings back the stealing/moving of chits from one hex to another (originally seen in Settlers of the Stone Age). It has a good theme, starting in the Eastern USA and progressing to the West, just as it happened. It's virtually identical to Merchants of Europe. I had both and elected to keep this and sell the European version. Both are great.

Medium heavy due to play complexity rather than rules complexity. You need to understand how all of the usual Settlers mechanisms plus the more advanced ones (moving Settlers and Trains) work together and how important it is to work with your opponents to give you a chance to win. You also need to anticipate how resource spaces may change as the game goes on, similar but improved from Settlers of the Stone Age.

Stand alone game; has many elements of classic Settlers of Catan, but play feels different; there are no VP; winner is the first player to deliver all his goods; playing time is perhaps a bit too long; disadvantage for me is that there are no official rules for a 2-player game.

Players build a network of cities and rail lines, and try to get their goods delivered.  Catan goes West ... players dice for resources, triggered via adjacent cities in good old Settlers fashion.  Resources are spent on covered wagons (settlers) that move and found new cities.  Founding cities frees up a cube that needs to be delivered.  The other stuff to build are rail lines and trains.  Trains move across the lines and deliver the cubes.  Sounds complex, but it works very well and seems so tight that everyone will come down to a turn or two of finishing.  Nice rules to encourage expansion west, as the resource chips migrate from the eastern hexes to the west.  Seemed long, but that could have been the first game.  Lovely looking game too.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Another great Settlers variant.  Slightly concerned (after one play) that there might not be enough paths to victory: everyone must build 7 cities and deliver 8 goods, and there's only so many ways to do that.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The thing I like about this is that it removes a lot of the things I hate about Settlers of Catan.  It's very easy to build cities and get more resources, if you don't roll your number you aren't screwed, you can do things on your turn in whatever order you want as often as you want, and you can build on other players' turns.  It definitely speeds up the game.  But the decrease in options for set up might decrease its replayability.  Need more plays to determine that.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
So far I like this much better than the regular Catan.  Maybe it's because I was recently on a cross-country Amtrak trip that makes me appreciate the rail mechanics a little more.  It does seem like the child of Ticket to Ride + Catan.

Not my cup of tea....on face value I liked the balancing mechanism of receiving gold if you don't get a resource.  But the number of cities on the board exacerbates the problem and the money does not make up for it.  Maybe with more plays it will go up , but I don't see that happening....life is too short to play games you don't like.  Give me plan old settlers any day over this.

After further plays, my rating stands....it's a game.

I'm not sure that the Settlers core is a good match for a pick-up-and-deliver game, but if you accept that conceit, this game is about as well done as could be imagined.   The need to settle coastal cities for coins is important, and building rails before other players is also important.   I think it all works together pretty well, and the game length can be scaled easily.   My only issue is that the tempo of the game is a bit too slow, and of course the dice can completely burn you.   Would certainly play again, but don't have to own it.

CLUB COPY. Absolute fun. It plays more as a train game than a empire builder. I say it's better than the original because interaction is more than trading in this game. What numbers you take away and whose tracks you use is a big deal. Does take a while to play.

If you look up the microbadge for fans of this game, you'll find only one person has purchased it.  Need I say more....

This game falls into the extremely rare category of games I've played but do not own.  I'm guessing our friend saw it in the store, saw it was a catan game and just couldn't resist.  I wish he had.  

The most annoying thing about this game is probably the resources.  The board is just too damn big and once people start expanding you need a chart to keep up with who gets what each time someone does a roll at the start of their turn.

Skip this one.

2016-02-20 : My 500th rating and mini-game review. Better than regular Catan, as you can't get totally blocked, but still a game that's not very deep. The thing is that sometimes you don't need deep thinky games at the end of a grueling  workweek and a game like this is all you need as we played it while drinking and bs'ing in what turned out to be a very pleasant gamenight. Forgettable, but ok.

I like this best of the Catan games.  However, due the the length of the game, probably the others will hit the table more often.  Everyone building after everyone's turn is what extends the time.  Too much pondering.

I like the end game mechanism; I like how the different regions of the US produce appropriate resources; I like how the East coast gets depleted of resources & you have to open up the West.

Settlers of Catan collides head-on with any number of train games.

This takes the familiar Settlers engine and whacks it straight into a nineteenth century freight train.  The mechanics are largely familiar, but the gameplay is very distinct from its predecessors.  A worthy addition to the Settlers range.

Settlers of America fixes the biggest problem with the original Settlers of Catan, players stuck with no resources and just twiddling their thumbs for extended periods of time. It's easier to found new settlements, both because it's cheaper and because there are no roads to follow, you get a consolation prize even if the resource roll doesn't benefit you, and you can buy resources with gold just like in the card game.

The game is still a bit on the long side, though.

After 3 plays still wondering why the settlement of the US is often happening from West to East and that their is little value to being the first to explore the West. You cannot explore alone.

This is a really different and interesting Settlers variant. But I'm also a fan of Age of Steam, which it has some resemblance to, although they not really are comparable. It's difficult to balance that you want to do settling as quickly as possible, but avoid to give easy opportunities for the other players to deliver goods. I believe this will be a keeper and it's one of the better variants. There is definitively less trade, but I don't care about that. You should rather consider this as a race game.

Two plays with four. It's nicely thematic, and the various mechanisms all work quite well, but the game just feels dull and plodding to me. Like all Settlers games, it's all about waiting to get the right cards in your hand and hoping that no one messes up your plans in the meantime; that sort of thing is okay in a forty-five minute game of SoC, but it gets [i]so freaking old[/i] in a two-hour game...and our second game of SoA took [i]three[/i] hours. Okay, we were playing slowly, but still, that's too damn long to be rolling dice.

Played 3+. Takes about 2 hours. I have enjoyed playing each of the following Settlers games a couple of times; Candamir, Cities & knights, Elusand, Catan Germany, Seafarers, Settlers of the Stone Age, Struggle for Rome and Settlers of America. If pushed I would probably say of these Settlers of America is the one I rate highest. It is still the base game that my family keep coming back to. I think these other games add a refreshing change but don't come close to diverting us from rating the original as the best. I relish playing whatever comes out next in the franchise. Dec 10

*UPDATE* Played my 5th game and my interest in this game has dropped. Each playing feels the same. Even though the reults are always close there is not the level of tension I would like. The later turns grind a bit as the amount of cards you have to play build up. Multiple plays with none gamers seems to lessen the enjoyment the game provides, it might be that multiple plays with gamers would be more successful. I have no regrets buying the game but after 5 games I am considering selling it. Aug 11

This is probably my new favorite catan variation.  I like that the actual network of tracks/roads now serves a purpose (pick up and deliver), rather than just connecting settlements.  With 3 players, the game felt just right.  Everyone could expand, but was still competitive.  Might be tight game with 4.  I also liked the depleting of 9-11 resources, as you settle west.  It's a nice incentive to move on.

RATING: 7
While it has many similarities and familiar mechanisms to its ancestors, Settlers of America has enough new twists and concepts to give it a fresh feel.  Players must be adept at balancing all of the different aspects, and there are important timing considerations.  The ability to bounce back and forth between the different actions -- building, trading, moving -- allows players wide creative latitude and provides ample opportunity for clever play.  All of these are big plusses and would appear to make this new version one of the best in the series.

There is one significant drawback, however:  time.  Every game I've played has lasted three or more hours.  That's simply too long.  The game tends to drag as players wait to amass the needed resources.  Plus, there are so many steps required to ultimately deliver a good, and players must deliver eight to win the game.  That takes time -- too much time.  Mind you, I play and enjoy many games that have a duration of three hours or more.  However, what I seek in longer games is continuing excitement and progressive development.  The excitement should continue throughout the game, without a déjà vu feel from turn-to-turn.  With Settlers of America, that feeling begins creeping in as the second hour is approached.  As is, it is about an hour to long.  There is an abundance of excitement and tension in the early and latter stages, but the middle stage tend to drag.

Longer than Settlers, which is bad. It also suffers from all of Settlers' extant problems--most damningly, the fact that the game engine is driven by random dice rolls. It seems inevitable that one of the resources (they're all indispensable) will become critically scarce, thus stalling the game.

I really like this game as a slightly heavier gateway game.  If newbies can handle this game, then it is time to move them to stronger games.   

There is less inter-player trading than the base game, but the two stages (get settlements out and then move those trains) add a nice layer to the game.

Settlers of America introduces new elements to the Catan series like pick-up and deliver, route-building, and the migration of resource production across the map. I quite enjoy playing this version as a departure from regular Catan.

It is generally a tight game that very cleverly, in my opinion, provides more opportunity for your opponents to gain VPs when you score them for yourself. The timing of your scoring matters.

The biggest downside to this game is probably it's length, which *can* be as much as 3 hours (but of course doesn't have to be that long). Trading resources with other players is also done less in this game compared to Catan, at least in my experience.

After two years of owning this game I have downgraded its rating slightly from 8.0 to 7.5.

First played July 6th, 2010. Taught in 20 min, played in 2.5 hours with 4 players. This Catan variant has the usual luck element, however if you get no resources, you still get a gold so it's leveled off a bit. Each player starts out with 3 resource cards, two gold, 3 houses, 3 tracks, and a train. Each player must build tracks, settlements and move your settler and train. Each player needs to build 7 towns (settlements) and ship 7 shipments (from train) to another town. On your turn you buy resources to fulfill the mission. Give this a try if you know someone who has it, otherwise, if you are burnt out on Catan games, give it a pass.

They took the concept of Settlers of the stone age and some rail concepts of delivery to make something new.

You have to build a Settler, move him to an open City space and replace him with a City marker to free up your cargo, build track to another players city, build or move a train to that city and put your cargo on the 1 space available to score a VP. Each one of those actions takes different resources so it's a bit too busy for my taste.

RATING: 6
I don't enjoy Catan anymore, but have heaps of respect for it. This looked like a more involved variant that might interest me. Efforts have been made to mitigate the down time and the luck of the dice to some effect. The game boils down to two parts, settling and then railroading. Both require different sets of resources to build, but you can only get cubes to deliver by building settlements, so things need to happen roughly in order. Players that can build settlements early (through luck or initial set up) have a big advantage. The game is still slow and the introduction of gold reduces the trading aspect, which is really the best part of Catan. I don't need to play this.

A little more complex Settlers variant but not as much complexity added as I thought after reading about it. Settlers of America introduces a Civ-like settler that can  cross the country indepedently from roads (SoC) or the herewith introduced rails. Whenever it stops on a city spot, it founds that city and further development can start from there. Players can't get stuck horribly anymore. The second new concept are railroads that have to be built up to reach the winning condition of delivering all your goods and are a mean to get money when a rail connects a city to another for the first time. 
Money - an even bigger difference than the open nature of development. It can be used twice per turn to buy a needed resource. Furthermore, whenever a player doesn't get some resource from a die roll he's compensated with a coin. As a result, trading happens much less in America than in Catan. Pretty big change for a trading focused game. Might open up the system to new trading-averse players but that was what Settlers is about for me. On the plus side, the kingmaker potential is reduced as well. I'd still prefer classic Catan but my game group tended more towards this iteration.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A really neat twist on Settlers, where the game is played in 2 stages: the settling phase, where you create towns out in the frontier; and the train phase, where you connect these cities with a network of rails. The way the number chips move west as settling occurs, and the way certain resources that re worthless at the beginning of the game are sought after towards the end make this game exciting every time.

I appreciate what they are trying to do with this game - even though the theme is somewhat pasted on, it still feels different and fresh.  The movement around the board feels less random than in previous Settlers games (Struggle for Rome, Catan Geographies) and more purposeful.  There are definitely a lot of choices and I like how the dice action migrates across the board with the settlers.

However the main problem with this game is the same as with many of the Settlers variants - it is too long!  If this was playable in an hour, I would be happy to play it again.  However this is more like 90-120 minutes, which is simply too much.

This game isn't going to change anyones mind about Settlers.  But I am a fan, and this is a very fun variant.  Instead of "points", this turns Settlers somewhat sideways and turns it into a race to deliver cargo.  To do so, you must send pioneers out, establish towns, build rail and trains and deliver cargo to opponent's towns.

I found the game was very entertaining, and despite what others have said, I did not feel that the game was too slow or overstayed its welcome.  I would happily play again.  I added this to my collection recently through a good trade.  Now the question is if I can get anyone to play it...

It all works well enough and is a fairly interesting variation on the original game. But it takes FOREVER, with almost no variation in flow. There's no arc to the play, just more of it. And more. And more. Guaranteed to delight anyone who ever thought that a Settlers game needed to be at least twice as long.

카탄의 기존 단점을 보완한 수작. 자원이 안나오는 암울한 상황이나, 차례가 돌아오기 전에 자원이 넘쳐서 약탈당하는 불상사가 거의 해결되었다. 

최장 교역로, 최대 군대 등의 기존 경쟁 요소 대신, 넓은 판위에서 펼쳐지는 철도와 자원 수송 경쟁이 이 게임의 특징. 

승점 10점이라는 애매하고 감춰진 요소 대신 물자 수송을 승리조건으로 함으로써 훨씬 게임 진행 상황이 투명해졌다. 

기존 카탄에 실망하거나 슬슬 질린 분들이라면, 추천하고 싶다.

This game is interesting and well designed.  You build rails and move across US delivering goods to score points.  Also resource spaces move west so older spaces are less valuable.  At the end of the day though, this is a 2 to 2.5 hour game.  I just don't want to play settlers for that long.  It is the same complaint I have against the 5-6 player version of catan.  90 minute 4 player cities and knights is the best version of catan.

This was a tough game to get in to.  The rules were super clear and it just felt tough to get started.  I actually owned it for almost a year before I actually played it.  

HOWEVER, once I finally forced myself to sit down and learn it and played it I really enjoyed it.  It has a bit of a Catan meets Ticket to Ride quality, but it's a bit heavier and plodding than either of those games.  It just takes longer than a game like this should. 

I like it, I'll keep playing it, I just wish it was a little bit shorter and a little clearer and more intuitive.

Basically I always feel like it's work to get this game going, but in the end I'm always happy I gave the effort.

My favorite member of the Catan family.  I enjoy how resources get depleted in the East as settlers move West.  I also like how the game transitions from expanding and settling into a train game where it is imperative to pick up and deliver.  The components are first rate as well.

The game is long, but I prefer this version to the original settlers. There's more to do, less downtime. Though it stays more or less solitaire play (just a little interaction using each others rails and delivering goods). I like the fact that it still feels like settlers, but with some more mechanics. I especially like the 'get gold when you don't get resources' rule. That's a nice improvement of the old mechanic: it gives you some more opportunities to do something even if you don't have enough resources.

11/12/11 Played a four-player game.
I generally like all things Settler-ish, though I don't care for train games. So this game had kind of a 2/3 good, 1/3 bad impression on me to begin with. I lost some respect for it due to the inadequate game aids, the extreme difficulty of moving the outlaw, its length, limited strategic options, and the clutter on the board.

02/08/2013: We've only played this once so far, so I won't say too much about it.  It's based off of the Settlers of Catan system of rolling a die to collect resources and using those resources to build stuff.  This game takes it a little further though, and turns it into a pick-up and deliver train game.

The one game we played was fun and we need to get it back to the table before I can offer better comments.  It has potential as a mix of Catan and train games, but I'm worried that its length will be too much for us to break it out often.

I like this one.  

Comments based on one play only.  First game playing time (including rules briefing), just over 2hrs.

A good Settlers variant.  Instead of building roads, one builds train tracks.  

I do like the game mechanism whereby newly settled cities can draw resources westwards, depleting resource generating sites on the east coast.  The introduction of gold is another good balancing mechanism while adding another "resource" that needs to be carefully managed.

Seems the game can end well before the west coast is reached, but that's OK, I think.  

Anyone who has played Settlers before can learn this game within minutes.  Many of the original Settlers mechanics are included:  resource trading, rolling the die for resource generation, the robber, development cards, and so on.  

Good marketing, combining Settlers with a lightweight Train game/theme, I think.  Recommended if you're a Settlers fan (perhaps not for hardcore train gamers who aren't into Settlers).

Fresh yet familiar gameplay. It's Settlers but with a fresh coat of paint. It has a couple of simple yet profound changes:

- At the end of each player's turn everyone has a chance to build. That means no more getting huge windfalls of cards then losing them all to a 7 while you sit and watch helplessly.

- If you don't gain any resources from a given die roll, you gain 1 gold. 2 gold can be traded in for 1 resource. 

The gold gained from connecting cities, from letting others use your track and from coming up empty (as mentioned above) really help do away with those long stretches of time where you sit and wait...and wait...and wait...until you can finally build something. 

It's essentially a modernized Settlers. It's gotten me excited about something in the Catan series, and I never thought that would happen again.

The game itself is pretty good. The problem is that we found it excruciatingly long (we finally quit at about 3 hours). It's lacking that tight "race to the finish" feeling that the original Settlers has, and has more of the bloated, overlong, do-the-same-thing-over-and-over feeling that 5-6 player Settlers + Seafarers and too much other stuff has, but just in the base game. e.g. 12 settlements built before you even qualify for victory. Ugh.

Not crazy about Trails to Rails overall, though I do love a few things about the game. The mechanics really make sense given the theme. I gush about this every time the box is opened. Getting money when you get no resources is a great addition. Sometimes you're happier getting no resources and it adds to strategy and trades. It's nice to be able to play Settlers but try something a little different at the same time. However, the game runs on too long. No doubt in my mind. Usually an hour in the game has been fairly unexciting. Components are nice but I think they could work together a little better. Trains and rails are fairly incompatible and things can get cluttered on the board. I LOVE the board. It's just not exciting enough for me to play often. Have turned down a few times.

Edit: Friends miss it, I am not sure how I feel. Still very long for what it is...

RATING: 7
A worthwhile Settlers spin-off, as although there are a number of core elements from Settlers in the game, there are also enough unique features for this game to be considered on it’s own merit.  Descriptions that says this game is a cross between Settlers/Ticket to Ride are wide of the mark; it’s more strategic and the delivery element is rather more important than the track laying (though obviously they go hand-in-hand). It seems nicely balanced, though perhaps, as others have mentioned, a touch long and can start to drag with a slow group.

A mix of Settlers of Catan and a rail game (Age of Steam, Steam, or Railroad Tycoon; take your pick).  You build settlements and get resources ala SoC.  But then you win by delivering cubes to other player's settlements via rail lines.

An interesting update to a classic game, Catan being the gateway drug to euro games for me.  The end game of this has frustrated me on several occasions. If you are too aggressive and not measured with your resources you can be stuck with no way to win, which i absolutely hate about games. Who wants to spend the last 30 minutes knowing you can't win?

I really like this version. Yes, it's probably 15-30 minutes too long, but the theme is richer than any other Settlers game I've played - sending settlers westwards to settle the inland, and then following with the building of the railroad. There are no cities, but you build lots of towns, so you're flooded with resources all game - so much so that they allow everyone to build at the end of each player's turn to clear their hand in case a 7's rolled. I like the inclusion of the penny variant - get a gold if you get no resources. Building rail generates more gold, and that gold can be spent for cards you don't have, further generating quick-ish build capability. The game's long because there's a lot of building to do, and trading's still preferred to spending that gold so it's still a feature. The overriding feeling at the end of the game is that it feels much more substantial than a normal Settlers game, largely due to how well the theme is executed.

A decent game, but not really one that I would chose to play over Settlers of Catan. Although the game appears to be fairly different when you look at it since you build Cities in a different way and have to deposit Good Cubes with a Train, the game play once you get down to it is almost the same. The game drags more and there is less trading, which is what makes Settlers of Catan fun for most. A decent change if you play a lot of Settlers of Catan and it may appeal to some, but I find the main drawback is the slow start as the second half, when the game starts to move more, is quite fun. If you love the Catan mechanics, then for sure try it out, but if the quick play and easy of teaching to new players is what draws you to Catan, this may not be for you.

TRY July/10.  I quite liked it, but it was long for what it was.  Would probably play faster once familiarity kicked in.

Played again Aug/10.  Still took what felt like a bit too long to play.  For a (slightly) shorter game, I would suggest allowing players to start with one more settlement in play already, within the purple starting area, and then having two cubes immediately available for deliveries.  That gives extra numbers for early rolls, to help get things moving.

I enjoyed playing Settlers on an American map.  I liked how different, yet similar, it felt.  I thought it integrated all resources pretty well, didn't have too overpowered "development" cards, and interesting ways to expand.

I enjoy this game, it's a nice alternative when the standard Settlers fare has become passe. It's an easy "sell" to gamers who might only have experience with Settlers as it's not a wholesale "re-learn." It's not a replacement for Settlers, though the fact that it's ever so slightly more nuanced in terms of complexity and options makes it a welcome addition in the rotation, especially among more casual gamers. Worth picking up, but not a mainstay in my stable.

Not a terrible game, some fun twists on the Settlers of Catan conventions.  It's just too long for it's weight.  I think this would be a great game for groups who just want to play Settlers of Catan all night.

Update:  After a second play, I still feel about the same.  I would add however that due to an increase resource-income, turns take longer as the game goes on, increasing the feeling of tedium.

A variant of Settlers where a where the goal has been grafted to a delivery race. The basics are all there dice to get resources with adjacent settlements, the robber, development cards. 

However having to manage more growth items and pay to get your settlements in place, and deliver your cubes provides a nice alternative feel.

There is a nice tension in managing the switch from building settlements to free up cubes to deliver and delivering the cubes to opponents cities. Have to balance building settlements close together and quickly and spreading out a bit more. 

Generally climaxes with a close finish usually the winning and second place are within a turn.

Really atmospheric and quite different variation of Settlers. I think Klaus must have played "Steam" a bit before this design. We missed one rule (receive coin if you don't collect resources) that made the game drag at the start, but I can see this as an excellent alternative to Settlers.

kind of a Settlers meets Transamerica.  What is great about this game is that is fluidly uses the settlers game mechanic and adds in a train element which complete changes the goals and strategy from the original.  spectacular use of the settlers mechanic to make a truly new game.  The aspect of trains and rails really seems to tighten the game thus the problem of a run a away winner is not an issue which can often be the case with the original Catan.  The own side is that it is really long!  4.5 hours for a three player game and we stopped when 8 goods where shipped not 10 as required in a 3 players game.  Easily the best Catan game I've played.  its close to the original in rating but different and is far superior to Settlers of the Stone Age.

I am a hard core gamer.  My groups fall into three catagories: Gamers, Family/Friends (gamers lite), party.

Party group:no way this could be played with the party group.

Family/Friends: they tend to like games like dominion and ticket to ride, which has some strategy but not too too many rules.  I tried this out with them, bottom line, they would rather play anything else.

Gamers:  also tried the game with them.  Too boring.  little strategy above: Make a settler, expand, connect cities, deposit goods, repeat.  All of this is based on lucky dice rolls.  Yes it is like the original Catan, but there is some screw your neighbor element there..not really here. I feel the first Catan is a MUCH BETTER game.  there was just no fun here.

now, I got to sale the game.  I had such high hopes.

I find this a great new version of the same old Catan mechanics.  The addition of Gold helps keep the game moving when the dice seem to hate you.  I can not wait to play this again.  Hopefully it will not get old with me like the original Catan games have done.

This is a fun game, but it is LONG. Long to set up, long to play.  There also is really NO historical learning that goes with it, so don't think you'll get in a history lesson with it.  I do like how the rails and settlers work (although rebuilding settlers gets old fast!) and that you can easily pay to use other peoples rails and you get "paid" for doing certain things.  But it just is too long for what it is and gets very boring after awhile - I LIKE Catan. I WANTED to like this. I just don't. If you want a Catan histories, I recommend Struggle for Rome. (JW)

It's like Settlers, but more fun. Still has the problem of the dice roll, but you still get something if your numbers aren't rolled. But the game is too long, which I think can be fixed by saying "only deliver 7 or 8 goods" instead of all 10.

I doubt I'll ever get this game, but I wouldn't mind playing it.

Now Settlers on the other hand....

RATING: 8
Played a 3 player game once. An interesting version of settlers that adds a train delivery system. It's fun to watch the board fill up with railroad tracks, trains and cities. I ran out of gold near the end game, and it became difficult to acquire any more at that point. I lost by one turn. Third place was so incredibly far behind it was laughable. I'm not sure if it was a game imbalance or poor playing. Worth adding to your collection if you are a settlers fan. 

Played a 4 player game. I find this scenario to be less aggressive and more strategic than some of the others. Where and how to build railroads will be the major consideration throughout the game. It's nearly impossible to get "blocked," and I found that a great relief compared to my last game of the Settlers Troy scenario where I was miserably floundering from the get go (no development cards in that game, so you're pigeonholed into a single strategy, or completely unable to do anything productive the entire game, as was my situation). 

As with most Settlers type games, it's very easy to be "doomed from the start" after initial placement. In Settlers of America, this is rarely the case, settler wagons provide a lot of versatility when it comes to resource production and there's more room to compensate for early errors mid game, and easy to prepare for end game rail resources. It's this openness, that I believe, elevates SoA slightly above its historical brethren and other like scenarios and permits careful planning to play more of a role than luck.

Yes, the game does have a few kinks which are easily forgivable (inadequate player aids), and an inefficient robber (numerous hexes and settlements tend to make the robber a little bit of a non issue). Game length could be a problem, and it would have been nice to see a longest railroad award or something like that. Despite these minor quibbles, I find Settlers of America to be an interestingly open and dynamic entry into the Settlers of Catan line up.

--Jun2012-- Very appealing Settlers variant: up with the best (and some are very nice) of the Historical Scenarios.  The mutation of the resources and components makes the game particularly interested for one that's as jaded by Settlers (while, perhaps, still admiring its place in the historic pantheon) as I am.  I found it interesting and entertaining.

RATING: 7
A very different Settlers experience. There's a tremendous scope for building in different directions and trying different strategies not seen in the basic game or the Geography series. The main difference is that you're delivering cubes to cities (but not exactly in an Age of Steam / Railroad Tycoon way). Westward expansion is encouraged as the Eastern production numbers gradually move in that direction through the settler wagon train expansion. All the while train tracks must be laid and trains moved with delivery goods.

It's all good stuff. It's a longer Settlers game, yet our first game came in at exactly two hours. With so much to do every round the game doesn't feel like it's dragging. Each turn every player gets a building phase. Gold production stops you getting stalled when locked out of a resource.

With three players the game is longer - due to less of a rail network being built and two more cities to found. I recommend removing these extra two settlements with a three player game. You get more or less the same experience in about the same time it takes to play the four player game.

Recommended for a gaming evening where you want that Settlers simplicity with the options knob turned up a notch.

The only down side to this game is it is always going to be a long one.  However, it takes the Catan formula and makes vast improvements.  The addition of trains and goods adds a whole extra level to the game that ensures every turn is a decision about what the best move could be.  Even though the game is long it never feels like it is grinding on, which regular settlers of Catan can do from time to time.

Yet another Settlers variant. It works pretty well, and is different enough from the others (although there is some similarity to Settlers of the Stone Age and Struggle for Rome) that it might be nice to play from time to time.

Differences from Catan:
- map of US, with mostly fixed numbers but several spots to place discs (numbers 9, 10, 11).
- build settlements (no cities) in predefined city sites, by moving a Settler unit there (spend grain to move 1-3 spots)
- as you build adjacent to hexes marked by '?', move the number discs from easternmost column of hexes (top to bottom)
- get gold coin if don't get a resource; each turn, may buy 2 resources for 2 coins each
- score VP by delivering cubes, using your train traveling over rails (costs gold to use other players' rails), to OTHER player's settlements. Cubes only become available as you build settlements
- no ports; always trade 3:1

Looks great and I love Settlers.  However, part of the charm of Settlers is how it moves along at a good pace.  Our game took FOREVER.  We brought a stack of games to the mall and chose this one first, barely finishing before closing time.  Taking Settlers and making it much longer and complicated just sucks the fun right out.

I like this game much better than basic Settlers of Catan because it reduces the luck factor while making every resource seem important.  No longer will you sit there for 4 or 5 turns with nothing to do because your numbers aren't rolling and you don't have any resources others want.  An elegant way of  making Settlers enjoyable.  Still not my favorite game, but I could play this every now and then without getting bored.

EDIT: I still enjoy this Catan variant, but it is eerily balanced. What I mean by this is every single game I have played comes down to the end where everyone is literally one cube from victory. It almost seems like it's too balanced to the point where the person who gets to the end first in turn order wins. I have seen people employ different strategies and yet this still happens. It's freaky.

I liked this better than the Struggle for Rome, but it's still way to long. Like with Rome, resources are still so scarce that trading just happens only occasionally (which admittedly is more often than in Rome, where it almost never happens at all)

In the same playing time, I would much, *much* rather play Settlers with Seafarers and Cities and Knights combined. The latter provides just so many more interesting choices and possibilities to pursue different strategies.

I did like the train connecting part, though.

Take Catan which just sits on the edge of too long for a random luck dice game and then make it even longer. Throw in a bunch of mechanisms that don't really add to the base game and you get this version of Catan Histories. Far to many instances of resource starvation which means you end up with a couple of rounds of everyone waiting on one type of resource just make for a frustrating experience.

Gets caught in between two genres.  It moves (a bit) towards the more "heavy euro" from Settlers, but does so less effectively than others.  I'd rather just play 3 games of Settlers of 2 of Cities and Knights than set this up.  Not bad, just not great at what it's trying to do.

Hey, you got your Settlers in my train game!

The result works surprisingly well.  It retains the feel of both Settlers and rail games.  The victory points have been disguised as deliveries that must be made to win the game, which I thought was rather clever.  I'd definitely play this one again.

RATING: 6
Continues the Catan Histories trend of changing up the familiar Settlers mechanics with new twists. Here, you've got lots of room to expand, but a fierce race to  build rails, connect cities, and deliver your goods first. Needing to rely on other people to build cities to deliver to is a bit strange.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.39
Although it's from the Catan series, this game plays a little differently. It has an interesting mechanic in that you must settle and move to deliver goods, which overall seem to be a little much compared to regular Settlers of Catan. There's definitely a strategy in how you settle and move, but it isn't the toughest to figure out. Overall, this game is an alright game if you like settlers of catan, but can get stale and overstay it's welcome quite easily. I felt it might be too long for what it is.

Although the theming is pretty good on this game (a general westward movement, wagons plowing ahead, followed by settlements, rails, trains, and congestion), but there are a number of problems in my eyes.  Firstly, it just takes too long for a Settlers game.  Also, to gain one Victory Point, each player has to go through the exact same progression of getting a wagon to get a settlement placed to clear up a cube, followed by getting some track down to move a train to place the cube.  That takes a lot of resources, including multiples of every type of resource.  No specializing.  That ends up being a lot of repetition and a lot of "doing" for one silly victory point.  Multiply this by eight or ten VPs, and three or four players, and you have a repetitive and long game that doesn't reward the time frame.

Compared to standard Catan, Settlers of America: Trails to Rails has a more concrete win condition. It's a race to deliver all your cargo, rather than a race to 10 victory points; it just feels less arbitrary. However, this does take quite a bit longer than standard Catan (over 2 hours), which makes it drag a bit at the end. It also keeps a little bit of that runaway leader problem, but mitigates it slightly with the introduction of compensatory gold if you get no resources. (Gold is tradeable for any resource 2:1.)

(July 2012 after 1 4p game) I have only played a few games of vanilla Settlers and this game added a bit extra that I found to be fun.

I enjoy the moving the "chips" from East to West which make some spots barren land as the game progresses.  I also like the extra build phase as the dice move to get your hand size under 8.   Somewhat unique feature of you build a settlement, the other players delvier their cubes (the victory condition = deliver all cubes).

Be careful if you're playing with AP players as it could bog down.  But at the right pace, I'd choose this over any other Settlers game.

Catan is off the island and in America. Fans of Catan are eagerly anticipating the next release in the Catan Histories line.
\13\\13\
The 19th Century has arrived and Americans are heading west. Wagon trains are forming up and heading out to settle new lands and build new cities. These new cities will need railroad lines to bring in new people and necessary goods. Some head west for the adventure, some to start a new life, still others to find work.
\13\\13\
Look west to make your fortune. As the population grows, resources will dwindle and the smart money seeks new sources and new markets. Finance your settlers as they head west to build the cities of tomorrow. Link these cities with rails of steel and operate your railroad to supply the townsfolk with goods. To the west lie lands to settle and fortunes to be made!
\13\\13\
Settlers of America: Trails to Rails utilizes the familiar Catan hex-tile grid to present a map of the United States. Players collect and trade resources, in order to purchase, migrate and build settlements, forge railroads and acquire locomotives. Railroads are used to distribute goods to the interconnected cities. As westward locations are settled, old sources of resources deplete. The addition of gold adds to the depth of play and increases options for the players.

This game is terrific. It's much quicker to setup than the original Catan and a lot more forgiving luck-wise. The whole affair feels more strategic and though the 3:1 trade option is always available and you get gold if you don't receive resources on a turn, the option to trade is always your best one. It's a long game, but I enjoy long games. I highly recommend this one.

One of the red pieces looks like a Settlers of Catan Village. I think it came like this, otherwise, I am not sure when the switch happened. Nonetheless, this does not affect gameplay at all. 

The box top has some slight wear. Otherwise, the game is in excellent condition. See http://imgur.com/a/Lh0jS

The well known mechanism of Catan, in a totaly thematic game that keeps the good feeling of the original and expands the strategic part. In addition it is very ballanced, something that was missing from classic Catan.

first settlers style game i've enjoyed in years.  it has a fresh feel, and the theme of expansion era USA is appropriate and developed well.  the wagon train settlers make the "westward ho" expansion flow very quickly.  the counter-intuitive railroad development is a little questionable -- in that the natural desire is to connect your settlements with your track, but this is totally wrong for the game.  you can of course go dry on resources with lousy die rolls, but this is par for the course for settlers game.  good game, if a little long.

A fun settlers variant with a train theme.  Could use a board printed on either side to make it truly great.

Like new, played twice.  Great game, just too long for my gang.

Strangely this is both the only Catan game and only train game that I enjoy. What are the odds?

Another convoluted Settlers spinoff.  Too many bits are laid along the hex lines, making the board cluttered and confusing.

Mayfair made an attempt here to shore up the weaknesses of their flagship game, but they still have a long way to go.

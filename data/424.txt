I really love trains-based games. This is a little bit longer to be played and to be explained to friends.
The thing I didn't appreciate were the materials. 
Anyway it's a must have.

RATING: N/A
Pleasant enough game but the extra stage of trains does add a fair amount of time to the game, though I do like the tussle of whether the 12s will break or not, and the 1830 pace of game doesn't really grab me. 

The quote I hear of this game rings true for me. The first 90% is great, it's the second 90% that drags.

There seem to be some expansion/variants to boost this but not tried them.

Too much open space, it's almost impossible to gain an advantage while track-building. It's an 18xx though, so still great fun. The added rules don't do much for me.

Another 18xx, great one, very focused on the market share. I think there is a big variation on this game from play to play, the rules are very simple and I enjoyed the fact that the bank pays the entire value of the enterprise when it becomes operable even when not the entire portions of shares are sold.

The rules are terribly written. It will take you a while to get everything together. 1870 belongs to the longer 18xx games. It will at least run for 6 hours and most likely even more. A bit too long.

In general the 18xx games have the historical feel of wargames and also their complexity. That makes them highly thematic and interesting to play solitaire. 

I enjoy playing them solo with 3 sides. The only thing you have to randomize (most of the time - sometimes you have to improvise a little) is the initial auction of the private companies. Take a die matching the number of available privates, roll for every side and place a bid on the rolled private. When the bidding over one private with bids from different sides starts, roll the die again for every side. On even you raise the bid for that side, on uneven you fold for that side. Repeat. Works perfectly.  

Old collection.

RATING: 7
I'm just not crazy about "the Ledge" also the ability for a President to immediately buy shares of their company that are sold as "price protection" is a mechanic that takes away from the ruthless flavor of these games. Yes, I know that was specifically the designer's intent but I think it takes a lot of the fun out of the game.

My very first 18xx game, and it is a very deep one.  The game is long -  so be prepared.  The rail tiles tend to get kind of knotted, but I take this as a statement about the geography more than anything else.  The trans-Mississippi is not the flattest or most rail-friendly piece of planet Earth so think carefully about placement.  Good game - I'm looking forward to trying other games in this series.

RATING: 8
Once my favorite of the 18xx games, a genre I find very deep and enjoyable, recently supplanted by 18EU (which may be a fad).  Much more open and free flowing than 1830 (which tends to be very static), nowhere near as hard or stuctured as 1835.  Length of game is a problem, usually about 8 hours in our group.  Some complain about the chrome, but its the chrome that sets this game above the other 18xx games in my opinion.

As a huge fan of 1830, I played 1870 only once so far.  It's likey to get adjusted upwards with more play.  Much more detailed stock market, lots more route building than 1830.  I have tons to learn about this game.  If you like the 18xx games, you'll love this one.

Was my first 18XX.

Initial impressions:

The price protection - I both like and dislike this.  The way it worked when it actually happened was interesting, but it really is just a threat in some circumstances that doesn't allow you to grab-and-dump a stock that is highly-valued, since the President will use it to break the 60% rule.  The change in turn order is excruciatingly frustrating if you are in between the relevant players.

The 50-50, works well enough.

I have recently started playing this with a couple house rules. The game ships with insufficient yellow tiles (oddly, it's the gentle curves that seem to run out) so I supplement from another game. Also, I start the game with an 18VA style initial auction (as I prefer in all 18xx games)

Tedious and drawn out 'xx in the '30 family.

Big trains almost impossible to come out, so each
game is something of a crapshoot as to what the permanent
trains actually will be - largely dependent upon whether
someone is suicidal. Pity too, this one has a lot of neat
little facets. 

fix? - make the 10 trains kill the 5's and the 12'a kill the 6's!

RATING: 6
Pretty good, but it gets whacked by me because of the severity of the private company auction - due to the way it's set up, if you make a mistake you'll be totally out of the game, which is really not acceptable. This is a game for experts, you absolutely have to be rather adpet at the system to really enjoy this game. It's also quite long, really too long IMHO. I've played a handful of times, and it usually checks in at 8-12 hours even after having played a few times. I've heard claims of much shorter playing times (4 hours), but honestly find them totally implausible unless you're an 18xx die-hard and very familiar with 1870. Strategy tip: the 12 trains should always come out. The reason they usually don't is simple player exhaustion; nobody wants to further prolong such a long game if they feel behind, even if it is in their best interests; but for at least somebody it virtually always is, and for the player(s) who will see the advantage, it's generally best to do your utmost to get them out.

The price protection rules are a PITA as regard changing the order of play and probably not worth it.  That said, this plays surprisingly well with 3.  Not great, not shiny, but the game is what is is: a big slow gentle charming dozer.

Update: I'm increasingly unfond of Bill Dixon games.  The train rosters are too long, price protection is laughable, and the games lurch like spastic hurdy gurdy ballerinas, suddenly leaping ahead and then pausing on tip-toe for a bit before leaping again.

Update some years later.  Yeah, I was young & blind & myopic and did not see the  values offered by 1870.  They're not the values of the enthusiastically testosteronal.

Update (February 2017): 1870 has a few remarkable traits. 

First is that all 10 companies are equally viable in SR1. Not just conceivably viable, but equally viable, each with multiple viable and significantly different strategic directions. That's not an easy thing to accomplish in an 18xx game and I remain amazed at how slickly it was done.

Second is price protection. Whooo boy! Price protection is a Jedi's sword. In the hands of a skilled player it is a thing of beauty and precision. In the hands of a slightly green player (and it doesn't take much greenness at all), price protection throws games, creates and destroys player positions and then cancels the previously thrown games and awards them to someone else. All in a trice and while machine-gunning random players and handing piles of money to others. It is beautifully opaque, indirect, skill-rewarding, graceful and brilliant...when used by a Jedi. Otherwise it mostly scatters slices of fingers, and random limbs about the place while the players stare uncomprehending and see nothing or wonder blankly at the scattering of mortal holes that now grace their positions.

Third...and this is a bit curious, is the train roster. There are essentially two ways to win 1870: Early money and a quickly packed and optimised portfolio; or: Run 12Ts for massive income in the end-game. They both work and work well (though the second pretty much disappears as a viable path with even slightly green players) and making that balance work as a design property is remarkable.

Fourth is the design's flexibility and resilience. 1870 is not a fast developing game, a violent game, or a quick game. It tends to start up, get rolling and to then trundle along at a fairly healthy clip while presenting the players with bounteous unclear options. And if something goes wrong or struggles or fumbles, there are a lot of ways to respond and adapt and reposition and bring the fight back to your assaulters -- if you can just see clearly enough. And then the same is true for them. And so on. The result is that the game becomes one of muscular pushing and pulling and shoving and adapting, giving a bit, gaining a bit, advantages claimed here but losses taken there...but then...and playing aikido both in the operations and the stock market (both must be in concert) with all the grace notes delivered by price protection. There's a fundamental charm and reward to that, especially for a group that plays 1870 often -- and I know of groups that have pretty much been playing 1870 ~every week of ~every year since it was published over 30 years ago, and they're still having a great time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Rating is almost certain to go up with further plays. One play with four players who were new to 1870 does not give me enough of a sense of the game to really judge it. Our play was easily the most processional game of 18xx I've experienced to date, though it's impossible to blame the game for that. From what I can tell, the structure of the game allows and encourages both deliciously large moves and very clever market micromanagement, but until we're more familiar with the title, those things simply won't appear.

It will be interesting to see how long it takes to play the game enough to feel fluent in its language--I'm worried that other titles will keep pushing it aside.

My favorite of the series - works well for 3 - 5.  Its only detractor is its length.  1870 is less cutthroat than 1830.  In my opinion, there are more varied strategies given the large map and the number of companies involoved.  It also contains some of the more interesting private companies.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.75
Running a company (your second?) [i]into the yellow to get around certificate limits[/i] and supply permanent trains to your other companies is something that should probably be done by (nearly) every player in this game. This may be true in many 18xx games with soft stock markets, but especially true when 2 non-full-dividend rounds can put a low-par company into the yellow and half dividends exist.

Keeping up the tradition of privates that come with President's shares. The [b]Frisco[/b] is probably not worth much more than face value. Par the Frisco high and do not invest heavily.

[b]Comparison to 1830[/b]

Unlike 1830, this game seems to be more about stacking up high dividends. The ramp up of train costs is LONG (12s? really?) and gentle, making vicious company dumping harder to manage. Additionally the value of stock in this game should not be understated, unless you've been deliberately witholding vast numbers of times your stock value will probably make you want to hang on to even mediocre companies. In turn you will hit the certificate limit fairly quickly compared to the length of the game... if you aren't careful.

Much like 1861 killed the stock market by limiting stock devaluation from sales, and 18GA killed its stock market by putting the shelves too close together, 1870 attempts to destroy its stock market. 

[b]Cons[/b]
Half-dividends... just seems too nice, I'm not fond of this rule in any game.
Price Protection. This rule is stupid and encourages static portfolios, it eliminates `minor' sales and the price fluctuations that *should* be a part of any 18xx game.
The Frisco.
Reissuing shares. Too nice, I like the stock buy-back but this rule allows you to discount the cost to the corporation.
The ``2-share'' ledge on the SM. This is stupid.
[b]This game seems too long by about 15% for my tastes.[/b]
[b]Pros[/b]
Stock Buy-Back. This is a beautiful mechanism. I'm pro just about any rule that allows players to suck money out of Corporation treasuries ... at their own risk.
A nice map, and the Mississippi bridges private is an interesting feature. In my one play of this the tile mix was very limiting, giving it a tight feel, but unfortunately prolonging the game as it slowed down our ability to make long runs and thus slowed down our train purchases.

As with other mayfaire relases, component quality is quite good. The rules are the standard copy/paste/modify.

Acquired February 2008.  

After further research, this game is longer in reality than what is listed on the geek.  I like the concepts of this game, but don't know if I'm ready for the time investment.  I barely get Railroad Tycoon played.  Seems like the ultimate Acquire game though.

Traded away July 2008 unplayed for Capitol.  Recently picked up Union Pacific and Stephenson's Rocket so I think I have plenty of Railroad games to explore now.  Letting this one go.

My re-entry into 18XX games was investing in this, after reading so many gamers (whom I respected for their opinions on other games) say so much in favor of this series.  And they didn't lead me astray.  What I had found (albeit through the briefest of encounters) fifteen years ago to be boring and overly convoluted, turned out to actually be completely compelling.

It is a 10 hour game without anywhere near 10 hours of game in it.  There were many interesting decisions, but their density was low, and most of the game was just tedious.  I found absolutely no joy in maximizing the use of my trains, and debating where to put the upgrades was more trouble than it was probably worth.  Of course, there were arbitrary limits on the types of tiles, so there was constant fenegling to upgrade a tile somewhere else in order to be able to use the tile that was replaced, that seemed totally artificial to the theme.  It was fun because of the people I played with, not because of the game.

my initial impression is that this is probably the best 18xx game. Its not quite as prescriptive or pessimistic as 1830 but does have some meaningful stock market play unlike some of the 1825 style games. It also has a more open map with room for more varied network building and most of the companies are feasibly profitable, and can work as openers. The train ramp also isn't too harsh.

This game isn't that difficult to grasp and it was my first time playing an 18xx game.  I really enjoyed the opening phases of the game, trying to jockey for position and get in on some of the action.  However, I completely buried myself on the opening turn and never recovered (bought a useless company and set the price too high, since it was my first time and ended up not having a whole lot to do for the first hour of the game until I got it up and running).

As far as the game goes, it was great until the end when everything was established and all we were doing was math.  I think games like these need a better end condition as we had the winner a good 2 hours before the bank was broken.  Still, I would play it again if it weren't for such an excruciatingly long play time.  You really have to set aside a day for this game if you have anyone at the table that is new (we had only one experienced player at the table).

The big, boring, slow 18xx game.  Amongst the worst in the genre, the price protection rules are stupid, the destination rules are annoyingly cruicial, and the end game takes forever.

Not my thing, but I totally understand the craze over this game and the loyal following of the 18XX series.  For my gaming minute, I'll take any one of several slightly less complicated and shorter train games with similar mechanics like Chicago Express or even steam.  BUT if you are after a longer, meatier, more involved train game you can't go wrong with this one.  The stock market system for the trainn lines is really robust, and a lot of the pivotal plays in the game revolve around when to keep and when to drop certain lines.  The track system, the engines, and the terrain is all very simple and gives you the framework to play the real economic game behind through the stock market, the dividends, shares, etc.  I can see getting into it if there was a local group of fanatics, but I didn't like it enough to try to start such a group!  I'm glad I played and would play again but I think for the average gamer there are options that will provide just as much fun without all the hassle.

Wow, this has some big differences from 1830!  The ability of a president to protect their shares (and hold more than 60% if they do use price protection) is amazing, and changes the game a lot!  Also, it makes sense that the IPO shares pay dividends to the company whereas the shares in the open market (held by the public, presumably) don't pay dividends to anybody.

The 8-, 10-, and 12-link trains change things up quite a lot.  The game might not make it to 12-trains, but if it does, then the 5-trains go away!  Could be a serious threat if a public company is floated late.

As in many 18xx game, it's critically important to time the creation of new companies well.  In the mid-game and later, you want to start them at $100 so that they have lots of cash to buy big trains (perhaps causing a phase change that obsoletes the trains of existing companies).  The $630 6-train which obsoletes 3-trains is a big step, and the $800 8-train which obsoletes 4-trains is an even bigger one which can punish players severely (they may have to buy a 10-train for $950 instead, if the 8-trains run out quickly due to forced purchases).

The "company destination" and "connection run" concept seems like a gimmick, and it might not be a good idea to focus on it until near the end, but it does allow a new station which, if uses as an endpoint of a run, doubles the value of that destination.  That could be a 100-point location (e.g. if a P-tile, or a red distant-market hex)!

It seems that a good strategy is the same as many other 18xx games -- the owner of the biggest sellable private company (in this case for $160 plus it comes with share of the MKT) has a good advantage, because once he starts a public company, he can sell it the private to raid its coffers for $320 and start up another company.  It takes good stock management to make this work.  But you also have to start up companies at the right time, too...

But honestly, I don't know what I'm doing in this game, strategy-wise.  I always get wrapped up in building great rail networks, but lose due to poor stock value and a lack of corporate skulduggery.  I don't think I'll play this game again unless its computerized, so that it takes less time to distribute dividend payments.  Also, I want to track exactly how much each player is worth, and use that info to analyze what is the best strategy to grow value.  I don't even know much a winning player's typical final score is, nor how that breaks down between stock value and cash.

My first 18xx game.  Although the game takes a long time to complete, it is not a "long" game, as there is always something for you to do, like planning out your next move, or which stocks you will be buying/selling, not to mention budgeting for that next train upgrade.

RATING: 8
After playing a bunch of Baltimore & Ohio, I was ready to return to this 18XX monster and even buy the game. My third and fourth games have clocked in at 6 to 7 hours each, with 4 or 5 players. With 10 major companies, it seems the sweet spot for 1870 could be 5 players, where everyone has an average chance of running two companies, and with increased chances of stock and track manipulation, compared to 1830. However, the board is somewhat spread out, so there may be little track interaction early on, compared to 1830. The major complaint is that there is no reason to go to the '10' and '12' trains, as the bank will empty with '8' trains within 5-6 operating rounds. It seems the game goes on a bit too long, with the inclusion of small towns on the map slowing the expansion and the game too much. Still, I enjoy this variant more so than 1830, but time will tell if I'm convinced otherwise.

The additions to the classic 1830 rules are all good. Splitting of dividends, end route bonuses, end game conditions, chairmen buyouts, companies owning shares etc. etc. all make this better than the original IMHO. Plus no one place is far better than the rest as in classic 1830. If you liked 1830 this is better. If you hated 1830 though this is unlikely to change your mind.

There's nothing about an 18xx game that provides me any form of enjoyment, and so the prospect of spending another three hours(at minimum) per session at least half a dozen more times just to progress past the conscious incompetence stage is unappealing.

1870 is the longest 18xx I've played so far. The distinctive feature is the destination run each company gets once it reaches its historical destination. This and the train roster with 12-trains as the final trains put a focus on track building while having a tamed stock market with the possibility to support the course of own shares by buying them from the market when other players sell them. It's a middling game in the 18xx series in that it doesn't feel as unique as its brother 1856 with the Canadian government railroad overtaking cash-starved companies, not as cutthroat as 1830, not as scripted as 1835 and not as focussed on track building as 1853. Together with 1889 it's my favourite 18xx.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A basic 18xx with no particular hooks and often a very slow tempo, with especially the endgame runs of a company with e.g. a 6T and 10T being just painful. Would rarely be my first 18xx choice when played physically

But I've really grown to appreciate the design when playing online, which hides the weaknesses. And specifically when played online seems to be a great game for relatively new players. Doesn't teach many bad habits, has a vanilla ruleset, and has enough companies that everyone generally gets to run 2 if they want to.

1870 - railroading across the Trans Mississippi - is a more complex 18xx sibling based on 1830. Very mixed feelings about this one. On the one hand, I like the stockmarket mechanisms and the new elements of the share price protection, the share redemption by the company and the connection run. On the other hand, this game plays way too long. The 12-trains will come out as this might benefit at least one of the players and this prolongs the game too much for me. To more or less quote someone else [note: I don't know the original quote]: the first 90% of this game is excellent, the second 90% simply kills the game. **** My first and most likely only session took 11 hours (without rules explanation and with three of the four players being familiar with 18xx). The endgame became tedious and I lost interest to calculate/optimise the train runs.

Every major change here from base 1830 serves to dull the game's edges and make it a more predictable, drawn-out game.

"Price protection" prevents stock trashing.

Half-dividends let company presidents avoid the tough hold-or-pay choice.

Far-off destinations and destination bonuses force the game into predictable patterns.

Ridiculous 10 and 12-trains make the end game UNBEARABLE with ticky-tack route optimizations.

And the big map draws everything out even further.  The 18xx group of grizzled vets I play with took 5 hours to beat this monster into the ground.

The core mechanisms that make 18xx worth playing are still ticking away here.  They're just smothered in molasses and pillow feathers.

The short game has some great mechanics, and is a lot of fun.  The main game has some good ideas too, like the stock market, but I can't help but feel that they aren't properly implemented.  When it comes to brass tacks, I just think the game should start about halfway in.  Real slow start.  I'd like to see what this game does again, but in a much more streamlined experience.  A pity, since I love the idea of playing with the MKT in Missouri.

I'm really conflicted about this one. On the one hand I like the mechanics, the fact that there is no luck, and the way the game works.  On the other I can't justify spending this much time playing this game, so it's pretty much impossible for me to get it back to the table.  So, on the one hand I would rate it a 6 or 7, but on the other I would have to rate it a 3, so I'm compromising at a 5.

This is my second favourite of the 18XX games, 1856 being my favourite.  Both games being Bill Dixon designs.  Both have fairly similar mechanics and jumping from one game to the other is quite easy.  There is a lot more track to lay in 1870.  Distances are greater than in 1856, which is reflected in the player's ability to lay 2 yellow tracks at a time, one one upgraded track.  

To my mind, the game progresses through the phases a little slower than in 1856 due to the need to lay so much more track.  The game is riveting and fun.

Fun but strangely paced 18XX that has a lot of trains and is very long. If I see someone win buying the first 12T, I'll consider rating it higher.

I like 1870 a lot.  It is a great railroad construction game.  The market is not as challenging as some of the others, but the focus on building railroad networks is a lot of fun.

What differentiates from some of the more competitive 18xx games is that there is a lot of space and many sources of income (including off-board sites).  Because of this, bankruptcy and brutal takeovers are not the rule.  There is sometimes a tough train rush though.

Because of the big board, I recommend playing with 4 or (preferably) more.

Maybe I'm just too dumb to see where the 2p game breaks down, but this one surprised me [after 1853, which doesn't play very well with 2] at how well it played with 2. 

The map and routes are tight, it's possible to pull off company dumps, and although it's obviously a zero-sum game, it doesn't really ever feel like it.

UPDATE: 

With 6, it's better yet, as might be expected.

I think I prefer this version to 1830's ruleset.

For me, it's a nice balance of stocks vs tracks.

It also makes good choices in where to simplify.

The private companies don't have awkward "can't build there" restrictions, except for the nicely thematic Mississippi River company. Their powers are neat and easy to understand.

The board is big enough to allow some flexibility in where you might want to take routes, and companies are well-positioned to make a number of interesting combos possible.

The map itself doesn't have many awkward features like the run-around for the PRR in 1830, the pre-printed yellow or grey tiles, etc. Instead, it's just a bunch of terrain costs.

The tile set is bigger than 1830 and doesn't lead to as many "GAH! I need THAT tile!" frustrations, which is nice. The one neat thing you can do is withhold yellow city tiles.

The stock market has some tweaks that some players don't like, but the more intuitive reversal of stocks in the IPO paying the company and stocks in the bank paying the bank is nice.

The strategic horizon in the game is a little longer, giving you more options for where to get your final trains and which ones to shoot for, also makes the mid-game stronger.

When there's time to play it, I prefer this to 1830. Price protection, destination routes, dividends to 'non-open market market' shares and abilities for companies to buy back shares make for more interesting decisions.  This is the type of game that you play over a long afternoon to enjoy running a good company and building good infrastructure.  I don't feel like I'm actively competing against my opponents at every turn, and sometimes it's nice to play an 18xx that way.  But those 10 and 12 train run counts can take their toll.  Perhaps we'll try the diesel variant.

A great 18XX game. A lot of minor refinements over the 1830 rules that put the final finish on the game system.

Takes 4-5 hours to play (though there are some options for shorter games). We don't play as often as it deserves.

Either we're doing something wrong or the game really is all about relentless money changing, hour after hour. I found it hard to work out what was a good strategy and what not. So the game's been sitting on the shelves for some years now.

Game mechanics are only mediocre compared to other 18xx titles, but what really sets this one apart is that every game is variability.  You'll never play the same game of 1870 twice.

My second game of 18xx to try after 1856, and I like the 1870 better, because of no diesels. Very long playtime (not a dull moment though). The destination runs were very interesting also. Price protection rule/turn order jump is the only thing that bothers a bit.

Railroads and stocks... I'd rather play a game of Age of Steam and a game of Acquire in the same time... or depending on how it goes I might be able to get 2 of each in.  At least 5 hours too long...

RATING: 8
Excellent game, not only do you get to build train track, and cut off your opponents routes, (though not always good if you then decide to buy into that particular company later), but you can also frustrate them by declining to issue a divide so they cannot make a purchase they wanted, or if you do it right screw a company into the ground and dump it into someone else's lap.

I like the elements in the rules that seem to fix ambiguities and errors that exist in the 1830 rules, but a lot of additional rules make this 18xx version complicated and long.  I like it, but it's a mammoth.

Very large map for an 18xx with many companies. The share redemption and reissue rules seem to add very little value (chrome) while the price protection does have a noticable impact on the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A long game, some protection from the nastier aspects of the 1830 share manipulation. It seems to be more engineering oriented  that is more interesting track laying to build long routes. 
One small annoyance is the "whistle stop" cities. These historically were built to early then later ignored as they did not grow. However in the game the players generally avoid them like the plague.

RATING: 8
18xx at its best!  A nice variation from 1830, but still in the stock manipulation realm.  There are a few more ways to protect one's stock price in the game, which adds a bit to the stock buying strategy.  The way that 1870 handles the market is a lot more realistic than 1830. Overall, I don't think that this map is as re-playable as 1830, so it is rated a little bit less.

Edit: In hindsight, this game is a bit of a drag as the stock market is calmer than other 18xx titles.

RATING: 9
Played once. It is said to have one major drawback: it's length. However for me it seemed a short game, I was completely sucked into it and lost my sence of time. Actually we played for about 12 hours, then went to sleep and spend yet another 2 hours to finish the game. I won and was still jumping with energy. It's great, but maybe a little too long indeed to deserve a score of 10. After a second play I have to admit that it is quite long. This time we stopped playing even before halfway, when it was clear that I was the winner.

An 18xx train game covering the midwest.  Stock market is not as brutal in this title as some others as a concept called price protection is implemented.  A good intro game to 18xx (but does tend to be a bit long--even for an 18xx).

Played it for the first time with all new players and what a fascinating game this is! We kept discovering if not trying new strategies. The only thing that keeps the rating down is playing time. We played for 9 hours, including a healthy meal though.

I really liked this game.  I don't think 18xx is the end-all, be-all of rail games, but I would love to be able to get some more games of this under my belt.  Of course, by far, the most difficult problem is the enormous playing time.  It can be really difficult to get people to commit to the time it takes to play this.  But, man, is it rewarding.  There is just so much left to explore. in this one.  I'm sure my wife is tired of me trying to set up a game of this, but if I don't push for it, it will never happen.  [02/08/2007]

RATING: 7.5
For a long time this was my favorite 18XX game, but it has been surpassed by many titles since the mid 2000s.  The yellow area which gives the ability to go above share limit, share price protection, and the destination runs does still offer some interesting strategic options, but this title rarely makes it to the table these days.  My preference is for newer games which have systems that allow players to run multiple small/minor style companies early in the game which are later merged together in some fashion or just outright purchased by larger companies in the mid/late game.

RATING: 8.5
This is a big game. Larger map. More stocks. Lots of companies. Added length. 

With this you get a real epic quality to it.  There is a wonderful growth to it, a perfect game for track builders.  Certainly this isn't a stock heavy game, but there is still some action there (as opposed to the flaccid 1861 stock market). Clearly this was designed for those that got humped too many times on the market in 1830.  The privates' powers add some fun elements to the game.  Cycling stock through your publics and setting new pars is an entertaining twist.  

Undoubtedly, this is a safer game than most of the other 18xx games I've played. I can see why it is designed this way as it allows for players to not get so beat up that they can't keep up with the pack.  Quite important for its length.

UPDATE: With more plays I've seen just how vicious this game is.  It is moderately "safer" but it still has brutal moves.  This game can really have some cruel results if people aren't paying attention or if others gang up together.

Easily the longest of the 18xx games I've played.

Any game that takes 12 hours to complete, isn't the right game for me.  I know we messed up a rule at the beginning that caused some of the extension, but there is way too much downtime for a game that's pretty much AoS w/stocks.  One of the few games I have tried that I can say definitively "No" to if it gets suggested again.

Next up for our lunch crowd...

Took us a month to finish with people being gone on certain days, or unable to pull away for an hour for lunch.

Still though great 18xx fun here.  Amazingly open track building after we played a couple games of the comparatively ultra tight 1889!

First game we played and it took over 5 hours. The thing that surprised us, considering the time, is that we didn't get bored playing it. With a few more plays I believe the time will come down and the game will flow more smoothly. The rules aren't that complex and if your group is willing to take a little time and read the instructions things will go much more smoothly. There's nothing like running your own railroading company.

RATING: 8
Probably my third or fourth favorite 18xx game and Bill Dixon's second best 18xx game.  A very fun early game, lots of companies and enough chrome with share redemption and the location to keep play and strategy distinct from 1856, 1830 or 1824.  However every 1870 game will bog down around 7 trains as you push through to 10s, making 1870 one of the longer games.  Still worth learning and playing though it won't see quite as many plays as 1856.

Long, slow tempo. Not so much a train rush as a train saunter. Lots of opportunity for big sprawling runs, which is just as well given the 12 trains. Fun to play if you enjoy things other than the stabby market moves of the other 1830-branch titles and don't mind price the price protection which breaks several intuitions.

Love the extra track building inherent with 10 companies and two yellow track lays per operating round. This along with the larger number of trains make for lots of run calculating, however. I also like the stock market in this one, with the ledge and the ability to redeem and price protect shares.

A very big 18xx game, but still my favorite of those I've played. Worth the time commitment if you're with enthusiastic players. Probably not the best choice as an introduction to the series, as the track mix is quite different from, say, 1830. It also has a tendency to grind down toward the end of the game, but I don't mind that so much.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
By far the worst 18xx I have played. In hindsight it is the first 18xx I could've gladly left unplayed. There is no reason to play this if there is any alternative 18xx to choose from. It loses it's pull long before the end and is way too long for that reason. It adds stock redeeming/reissuing and destinations but I don't see them really lifting this up and above. The map is just plain boring. Towards the end the route calculation is just a pain and all game choices seem to lack significance after half the game is completed. That is a usual problem with 18xx but usually the meaningful choices go on almost to the end and don't cause this kind of feeling of pointlessness.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Have several ideas I like (dividends on initial shares / redeemed shares goes to company, share redemption / reissue, price protection, destination runs).  However, the full capitalization, meaning companies start with lots of money, together with 60% being required to float, meaning not too many companies will float early on, leads to a game that feels not as sharp and exciting as 1856.

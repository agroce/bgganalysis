The game looks really good, and has dice! I quite like how you have a common dice pool and use the dice to take actions. Herding and trading cattle is also a nice choice for the theme.

Falls into the Family Game category but has a number of rather complicated rules and concepts for a pure family game.

The scoring mechanics are very simple, yet there are many small rules and quirks that turn this into a surprising brain burner. The best option is not always obvious, but you only need to choose two dice so it's not an overwhelming game. I love the dice placement mechanic.

Some interesting ideas about dice usage and luck mitigation, but I'm not sure the package adds up to a great game.  Good theme and art.  I just don't think the [b]Keltis[/b]-style set collection fits well here.  I get nervous when I see so many points come from endgame scoring  (and no intermediate scoring)...it's hard to tell who's winning.

Really sweet game, worker placement with corresponding die pips circa games like Troyes, Castles of Burgundy, etc but with a lighter theme of South American cattle barons rustling up the Pampa. Love the look of the board, the goofy artwork, the layout, the 3D feel of the dice pen, and this definitely fits that light to medium mold which you might wish to use as a gateway worker placement. The theme felt fresh to me and it has a lot of character, and the herd scoring is also interesting. The Steal Cattle special action is a treat!

City Slickers the dice game. I'm a sucker for dice games and this one is clever enough to keep my interest.  It is prone to AP, which is a bit of a paradox given its relative simplicity. As such, the game runs a bit too long for what it is. That said, I do consider it a keeper because I know I will periodically get the urge to channel my inner  Billy Crystal & rustle the pampa with my gouchos.

I do not care for this game. The strategy is entirely based on getting the biggest sets of cows. Getting the #12 or #11 cow for your set is practically required. There's no real incentive to diversify your herds since there isn't enough time in this game to efficiently do so. The worker placement spots aren't that interesting. The "Sell your Herd" spot seemed especially useless because you just sell everything in the end anyway. I understand that it protects against being stolen from and gets you a few extra points but other actions were simply better. Being last in a 4p game often meant only being able to use one die which was annoying. The "take that" element felt necessary in order to keep things balanced but halfway through the game the people you should steal from (aka the leader) and the person you wanted to steal from (the last place guy who happened to have a cow that worked with your herd) were different people. I don't mind take-that but I do have a problem when you're incentivized to pick on someone who has no chance of winning. The positives are very nice, welcoming artwork, the excellent dice corral which is completely unnecessary but still cool, and also that the game plays relatively quick. The game itself is very bleh.

Initial Impressions:
----------------------
Interesting Medium-Light Euro.  I thought the mechanism for placing workers for future rounds was interesting.  The Dice selection mechanism was ok, but it the last player for that given turn really gets kind of screwed.  The theme was not really there, but the overall art and graphic design was well done (plus the 3d fenced in dice tray was cool!).  One I think I am going to keep around, since it is a nice Euro that plays within an hour (a nice one to end the night on once in awhile).

RATING: 8
A different set collection/dice allocation game.  It can be a bit mean as you work to collect cattle but I like it.  In fact, it probably behooves you to do a bit of cattle rustling from others to keep them from scoring their max.  Production is awesome in this one, too.

RATING: 3
Way too long for what should be a filler game - too much downtime, too prone to AP, as you have to draft two dice a turn.

Theme is totally pasted on, and wasn't that much fun - just roll dice and try to collect cows using the right number, collect the right 'race' (surely this is a breed?) and the right number.

No development, each turn is the same,

Yawn.

Just read the rules... interesting.  

So, on your turn you role 2 dice and then use them to either 
(1) place workers on tiles that you'll later claim
(2) place workers on special actions you'll later use -- there's no fighting for worker spaces, each player has one worker space allocated to them for each action

At some point, you'll want to sell the sets of tiles you've collected.  Then you get paid the size of the set times the highest valued tile in the set.  

Most of the actions are innocuous but two of the size let you steal tiles (claimed or unclaimed) from other players.  

So, the randomness comes from getting better dice that let you claim better tiles and let you take better special actions.  

I suspect it will be a myeh game with some interesting interaction and a lot of groans and cheers when people claim the dice you wanted to get to take (all dice are rolled at the beginning of each round and then player take turns claiming two with one left over).  

Will be interested to try but definitely a try-before-buy game.  I also suspect this will be a big-box game that will put it out of my desired price range.

The dice just don't seem to add much to the game even though they are its central element.   Most of the time I found that I could pretty much ignore them, and just opportunistically take whatever they told me I could take.   Or, there was enough dice-changing stuff on the board to allow me to do what I wanted to do anyway.    Falls a bit flat.

The steal from other player mechanic is also way too strong.    No desire to really play this one again.

A neat little worker placement game with dice. Despite its cute exterior, it can also be pretty nasty, allowing players to outright steal cows from other players, which can be devastating to their final score. 

What I like about the design is that the pressure from the threat of attack by another player is nicely balanced by the option of cashing out your herd early. So, what seems like a kind of vicious mechanic is actually the vehicle driving an important push-your-luck element of the game: without direct attacks, the game would break down, allowing unstoppable runaway leaders who simply happened to get lucky rolls/draws. Good game.

Stark, repetitive, very calculative. Not a very appealing game to play overall as a consequence. The dice really don't offer any 'lightness' in this title; adding insult to injury, the high results are inherently better than the low results even though there is a bit more choice in how the special actions can be chosen. Then actions designed to hinder other players suffer from symmetrical trenchwar patterns: I can steal a tile from one player, only to have the same player retaliate immediately (if there is a meeple on the corresponding action space). If you go out stealing first, then not being able to defend yourself will hang as a sword of Damocles over your head. I'm not a fan of this particular aspect.

Some original ideias are gathered in here, as the need to look out for every tile each player has, so that it will be possible to maximize each one sequence of animals for the maximum number of points.
However, by the end of the day, one finds out that the game relies to much on the mechanic "steal that specific tile at the right time" so, it can be somewhat frustrating and not very pleasent.

I really like this game. I love having a bunch of dice to choose from to determine what actions I can take or what cows I can bring into my herd.
Although, it is hard not to feel like the game hinges on whoever manages to recruit the highest valued cows. 
Not much depth to the strategy but fun none the less!

I like dice drafting and set collection, but the game almost feels too forgiving.  Since you always score all your points at the end, there's no real incentive to score early, and you can just keep accumulating cows to score massive points.  I suppose the intended incentive is the ability to steal other player's cows, but like other economic games with antagonistic options, this kind of mechanic feels out-of-place and most people don't bother.

TRADED IT! (for Trambahn)

The core "Lost Cities" set collection mechanic is nothing new, but works for what it is needed to do. Using dice to achieve this, is a solid addition to this mechanism.
The pop up fence is an awesome addition to the game, it works as it is intended and adds real flavor!

The cowboy action areas ought to be more interesting than they are, and in truth this let down was the motivator for trading the game. Having to wait a turn to utilize these effects just felt wonky.

It is an economic game in which you are raising cows to sell them later and earn lots of money. Plus the box looks like a typical boring euro game. Nothing against people who like these kinds of games, but for me, when I see a box of Caverna: The Cave Farmers, Concordia or The Castles of Burgundy, I have no desire to try them. I would play if people wanted to and I could not persuade them to play something else, but I will never suggest them. Thankfully, I have never heard about El Gaucho untill one guy brought it to a game night. And thankfully, the game only has ugly box but the components are great. I would never have guessed that I would like the game. BUT! I really like its take on worker placement. I hate worker placements where I can't do a certain action just because someone else stepped on it before me. So this mechanism when everyone can step on everything, doesn't get to use it immediately but can use it anytime later is just right up my alley. Plus I love the push-your-luck system where you have to decide if you sell smaller herd for lower amount of money or if you risk someone stealing your cows and go for the big bucks. Plus, it's super cheap for what is in the box

El Gaucho is a light dice-drafting game in which players build cattle herds to sell them for the most profit. Dice can be used to claim cattle or to "preload" a number of special actions that, for example, allow stealing cattle from other players' herds or give a free action.

Without the special actions, El Gaucho would be an entirely unremarkable game. They add ways to interact with the other players and also provide a means to defend against some of the less friendly actions. Proper use of these extra action is essential in this light and (unless you play with AP types) quick set collection game.

There are only a few things you can do on your turn but there is enough to develop strategies and enjoy each turn tactically.  The mitigated dice use(a la Yspahan/Marco Polo/La Granja) is a lot of fun!  What a neat and practical idea to put the dice tray on the board.

It does have a nice amount of interaction but allows for less aggressive play if that is what the players desire.  There is a nice tension that builds towards the end and, while a lighter game, it ends quickly enough to not wear out its welcome.

Too long and complicated for what is on offer. Furthermore, spoiled by a targeted attack possibility that can't be defended against. Given equally competent play, the consequences of attacking are severe enough to make the player lose who gets hit on once more. While the decision of choosing and using two dice from a central pool is reasonably interesting, the whole package ultimately doesn't work for me. A hideous cover doesn't help its case.

A little too much take that for my taste. When you see how easy it is to steal, it's simple to see that this is not meant to be a heavily strategic game where you mull over your moves. You try to score often, as trying to build up a big set for big points is sure to invite scrutiny and screwage. The main problem I have with the game is that the rules overhead is still too much for a game this light, which is always an awkward combination.

Good game, although the steal a cow action is way too big of a points swing.  I would like the scoring of game to be adjusted so that it can be a closer game. Because of the way the game scores points, it makes the path to victory not variable.

Really quick and quite interesting. It's not merely about trying to grab the cattle. The actions are adding a bit of planning to the mix. That actions are having summoning sickness and there are some take that actions included adds quite a lot of dynamics to the game. I was especially surprised to like the take that aspects as the game would likely be a tad boring if they weren't there to force the players to act instead of waiting. The dice rodeo was also pretty cool as it's not only thematic, but also functional as it prevents the dice from rolling around the table or to the floor.

Very tactical game. That could be a problem with AP prone players. Despite the large scores the game ended pretty close (three players next to each other). I found the downtime huge, for a dice drafting game. Specially because you get two dice and perform all the actions.

El Gaucho is 3/4 a good game. The publisher should've just added a bit more variability (so every game wasn't the same) and more importantly made sure that the game didn't have a crazy "how did this get published" scoring mechanism which pretty much destroys the whole game.

FIRST IMPRESSIONS:

I enjoyed my first play even though the game is pretty light and has some theft involved in the game.  There is some worker placement where you place workers for use in a future turn which was cleverly implemented.  One can also claim cows several different ways using the dice so even if you went last there were usually decent options for you in use of the dice.  The fences provided were a nice thematic touch to provide the dice tray on the board...:-)

I wasn't sure I was going to like this but to my surprise it's a joy to play. Feels different from other worker placements. Stealing  or being stole from works well and that normally irritates me in games.

Interesting light to medium weight game that got its inspiration, I think, from Keltis, Yspahan and Koehandel. 

The game looks fantastic because of the fenced land that is used to throw the dice in. Having white dice with black dots, make it seem there are cows in the meadow. Great idea!

At first this looks like a simple set collection game, but don't be mistaken. This game has a lot of options. Cows can be obtained in many ways. Using the extra actions wisely will make the difference. And of course you need to make sure to collect the right cows in the right order. No this is not a game for beginners.

at a first glance, this game looks very thematic, but after a while, the theme tends to disappear in this challenging game.
Depending on who plays this game, it can be constructive or destructive. Not sure if stealing cows is such a rewarding action though. 

Minus: 2 - 10

One of those in between games that doesn't rate well on BGG because it is too light for heavy gamers and too heavy for non-gamers. It's right in my wheelhouse, though, as I like games with simple rules, short playtime, a dose of randomness, meaningful decisions, and a little bit of mathiness.

Deciding when to steal, when to score before an opponent can steal, and when to force rows to complete (usually to screw up an opponent's desired order) are all intriguing choices.

Long story short, this one is way ahead of something like Yspahan for me.

This is a neat game of dice drafting and set collection. You are trying to build up herds of cows so you can sell it for as much money possible. The cows have to be placed in order either ascending or declining, so not only do you want to choose specific cows to claim, but you also want to make it so you get to claim them in the right order.

In addition to claiming cows, you may choose spots that give you abilities to steal cows from other players (which sounds mean, but the other player is awarded "insurance money" for the cow stolen, so they aren't completely at a loss if this happens), manipulate a cow's position in the herd when claimed, and so on.

The game is very straight forward, easy to learn and doesn't take too long to play. Some might say it doesn't have much replayability as it will play very similarly every time, but I think it works as a light weight game.

No idea how to rate this one. Its really a tough game if you play it with two. And for my taste its no family game if you want to play it right. Reminds me of paying Keltis with dice. Great graphics. 

Rules you should keep in mind

- You cannot occupy an Action Space and use it on the same turn

- Also, you cannot place a Gaucho on an Action Space that you have just used

- Steal Cattle: You cannot combine this action with Sort as the latter can only be used when collecting Cattle at the end of a round. The player you stole from receives indemnity from his insurance

- Sort You can place ONE Cattle Tile that you have just collected anywhere within its Herd, even at
the very beginning.

There's nothing "wrong" with this game.  It just feels like something is missing.  Perhaps some other way to gain victory points would help.  I've only played 2-player and I don't think this is optimal.  I do like the general set collection mechanic. The worker actions are "ok" but are a bit flat.  There's also an odd mix of euro and interaction, as there are a number of interactive ways to hose your opponent(s), but at the same time it feels very euro'y in trying to figure out how to maximize your points.  Will need to play again with more players to see if my opinion changes.

Very light dice game, though the rules are a tad convoluted for what the game is. I enjoyed it, but it also has about the same depth as something like Takenoko. That is to say, there's barely any depth at all. I also felt the game was a little more swingy and luck-based than I like. The cows come out completely randomly, so unless you're willing to steal them from your opponents for points, you're kind of at the mercy of both the dice and the random cow draws. Good family weight game, but not something I need to hang onto.

Dear God this is slow - hard to believe there was so much AP. Nothing to do between turns, lots of trap-n-zap interplayer smackage, few meaningful decisions. The cow tiles are nice, and I like the gaucho meeples. Little corral for dice rolling is arguably the best part of the game.
Played four times, with experienced hobby gamers. Continues to drag, and the crux of the game is purely timing sales so that your tiles are not stolen at the last minute. Collect sets that others are not, setup extra actions, sell..
It does look nice though.

Received in a math trade (1/17/16).

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]We got in a couple more plays last year and my initial concerns were spot on. The dice drafting wasn't enough to keep this game fresh, it quickly became very repetitive and played out after a handful of plays.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (6/8):[/COLOR]

[i]- Family weight version of Grand Austria Hotel (specifically the dice drafting).
- Beautiful board and components, I love the coral you roll dice in.
- The additional worker placement spaces open up the strategies in the game and add a good amount of player interaction.
- Fun scoring method that combines set collection with strict placement rules that takes some planning to maximize.
- My one concern is whether or not this game will stand up to repeated play.

I only got to play this once with my family, but we had fun. I really became interested in this game after playing Grand Austria Hotel and really enjoying the dice drafting aspect of the game. I new that would be too heavy for my wife and older daughter so I started looking for another game with similar mechanics which lead me to El Gaucho. It took a few turns before things started to click, but once we got it the game moved along quickly (we finished a 4p game in about an hour). We've played a lot of new games this month so I'm not sure how I really feel about this one yet, hence the rating. I'm curious to see how it stands up to repeated play, I'm not sure there is enough variety in the game to keep it fresh for a lot of plays.[/i]

I love the combination of mechanics in this game.  Rolling all the dice at once and selecting only two dice to use each turn for your actions is great.  Claiming cattle tiles either by standing up a gaucho or laying down a gaucho (which will take you two turns to complete) makes for good decision making.  I like the ascending/descending set collection.  The multiplying scoring mechanic in this game really makes you watch your opponents closely.  And of course, the six worker placement locations at the bottom of the board are all fun and important for winning.  And it's all cows!  Love this one!

The art work is great and the game design makes it look like a very simply game, but there is more here then you may originally perceive. You place your meeples on cows to collect herds using a set of two dice which are rolled by the start player. Based on the number of pips you can select different actions or claim cows but be careful as your cows are never safe. You eventually trade them in for points.

El goucho was cute. It's a gateway game where you pull a die from the action pool and take an action matching the number printed. The actions all relate to gathering and selling sets of cows. The game has a few actions that steal from other players, but your opponent get some compensation in points, so it's only a little troublesome. It's quick playing, and enjoyable.

My first game, three players, dragged because of some AP. I hope game play will go faster.

It's a drafting game with two layers: You draft from a pool of dice which determines what else you can draft: Either cattle tiles (for set collection scoring) or for special powers.

Lots of capricious tactics from the special power to steal someone else's tiles. This I think is the primary source of tension in the game.

Players roll dice in a corral that's built on the board (which is a cardboard frame that fits into slots on the board). Gimmicky but practical: The dice don't fly over the board and greatly adds to the theme of the game. (The theme itself is pasted-on.)

Deceptively easy to learn and with a good bit of negative interaction.

A very unique euro game that mixes worker placement with set collecting.  Sets you are collecting are herds of cattle.  The worker placement helps manipulate these sets to score bigger when selling them.  I can't say I've played anything like this game.  It looks cute with the artwork but it can really be a number crunching game as you are trying to maximize your points or take away points from your opponents.  There is a little bit of a cutthroat aspect as you can steal cattle from others but there is compensation to the victim so its not all bad.  Just a great game that made me want to play again after we just finished.

It's all about the timing. A simple mechanism with an important setup for the endgame. Along the way you're playing quick turns buying or reserving cattle, and Taking your reserved position in a number of special action spaces. Sell before you're stolen from. Block your opponents. Clever, simple to learn and teach. Ticks along at a good pace, but probably best as a tug of war battle between two players.

Everything about this game says it's very cleverly designed. From the timing of the turn order and acquiring cattle, to the value of the 4, 5 & six action spaces and the aggressive yet forgiving player interaction. Yet somehow it feels a bit off. On paper it's wonderful. So far in practice it's been okay, but just not as much fun as it seems it should be. I'm going to keep exploring a bit more just to find out if I can learn to love it.

RATING: 5
Played once with 3P. El Gaucho puts a spin on a [thing=50][/thing]-esque style of set collection by combining it with dice drafting. Players collect tiles in either ascending or descending value, and score sets whenever chains are broken. Although the scoring mechanism rewards collecting larger sets, players have to be wary of opponents rustling prized cattle from their herds.

For me, El Gaucho falls in an awkward spot where it is too thinky for casual gamers, yet too light for the more serious ones. While the special actions help balance out the luck of dice rolls, they also add to the time taken to figure out optimal dice combinations. The end result resembles a padded out set collection game.

1 play, wrong rule (skipped the preliminary round!)

An interesting, quick-playing dice drafting/allocation "set collection and take that" game. Sort of like Alien Frontiers, but different. Like that game, though, there is one key painful action that allows you to steal stuff from other players. But the last turn was also incredibly annoying: it only made sense to attack players after you in turn order, and everyone but the first player had to play defensively.

If you don't mind take-that games, this might be pretty good: 7+?

For me: probably a 6 at best -- I don't like take-that games!

[b][u]RULES SUMMARY[/u][/b]

There are 5 types (colors/species) of cow tiles, numbered 1-12; several of these (varies with player count) are randomly placed in rows on the board during the start of each round. Then, the start player rolls several d6 (2n + 1 ?). After everyone takes a turn, Start Player passes left.

In order, players select and use 2 of the d6 -- either individually, or by summing the values. These allow you to take several types of actions, based on the value(s):
- place meeple on an unclaimed (meeple-less) cow tile. 
- place meeple on an available special action space.
In addition, you may use a special action space you had claimed at the [i]start[/i] of your turn. These allow you to do a variety of things: virtual die, steal a cow, claim cows, recruit cows from a separate pile, sell a herd, etc.
 
At the end of the round, every row on the board (the pampas) having a meeple on every cow is awarded: players with standing meeples in the row claim the cows they are standing on. When you claim cows, in any order each cow must be placed at the [i]end[/i] of the row of its color. Each row may be arranged in either ascending or descending order; if the new cow breaks that rule, you sell the previously collected cows of that herd (color) and start a new row with that rule-breaker -- you earn money (VP) = (highest numbered cow ) x (number of cows in herd). Sold tiles are removed from the game.

[u]Preliminary round[/u]: before the regular game, players get a number of cows to start their collections.

[b]Game End[/b]
When the draw pile of tiles is empty, finish that round and one more. Then, one final half-round: no dice roll, but players may use their special action spaces.

[u]Final Scoring[/u]
Players collect the cows with standing meeples and add them to their herds. Sell all herds (including single cow herds). 

The player with the most money wins.

The ability to steal and to time your actions to avoid others gives this some interest. Plus the cute production. Happy to play, don't need to own.

This games lives on its graphic design and not much else. The game works, but the mixing of dice rolling/picking, worker placement and set collecting is just not clicking with me. I fail to make sense of the gameplay.

Plus the game doesn't force interaction between players, it just happen if a player takes it upon himself to force it. With 5 types of cow, even with 4 players, everybody can pretty much collects his own type. Little incentive to steal cows or even do the special wish or sell action.

tl;dr: fine family friendly strategy game

Dice are cool and worker placement is my favorite mechanism, so of course this was on my radar.
Having dice usually means a lighter game, and that is indeed the case. It is quite family friendly, but it still has a good dose of strategy and tactics.
It does also include a way to steal from other players. This is not an element my group is a big fan of, but it wasn't too bad and with the quick playing time it isn't really an issue.

Really light set collection game, plays great with new gamers and younger players....trying to get those cows!

We haven't been playing with the "thief" mechanic...it has not been a deliberate rule change, I think we've been just ignoring it and playing "friendlier" games.

El Gaucho is a perfectly polished and pleasant design, but the warmth of the theme doesn't really transfer to game play.  Pick two dice, assign them, collect tiles in order.  It's an exceptional production of a clinical design with little player interaction.  For many, that's just what the livestock veterinarian ordered.

I probably wanted to like this game a lot more than what its rating suggests. That said, the game is fine. Not spectacular but certainly above average.

So, first impressions: the game is a lot more complex and variable than what the rules would suggest. The simple act of selecting which cattle to take and the timing of adding it to your herd makes the game quite complex in a brain-burning sort of way. Throw in the fact one can steal cattle from other players, this game has quite a number of unseen variables which may not be obvious from the rules. As a result, I disagree with many reviewers that claim this is a good family game. Simply too much conflict and brain-burning decisions to be made for a short and inclusive family game.

     There are a few annoying weaknesses to this game. First the dice. Yes, a few times, my ability to carry out actions were hampered by the lack of suitable die rolls. This was annoying as I was unable to plan or do the actions I wanted. Sure, one can argue this is a dice rolling mechanism integral to the part of the experience. But nonetheless, there were several annoying occasions that my best laid plans were thwarted by the dice

Surprisingly fast playing dice-drafter with just enough decisions to be fleshed out. While you have lots of options, going after high-valued cows always seems to be the best option, which can end up feeling a bit flat.

That said, the game is such a whirlwind (with compensation for getting screwed) that it almost doesn't matter. Looking forward to the upcoming expansion!

Provisional rating, one play - but I don't see any hidden depths to explore in a second.  Quite fun, seemed more about the stealing than the building up of choice herds.

Pretty fun, solid, quick game.  I feel like it sits in an awkward spot, it seems like it should almost be gateway level, but there are enough finicky rules to make it a bit tricky to teach.  It's close to filler level, but a bit more. 

I love games where you're faced with making the best of what's available to you, and also games that require you to keep a keen eye on your opponents, this game has all of that but it's still fairly light and over in the blink of an eye.  I like it, but it's hard to place when I'd play it.

Not quite the gem that Yunnan was last year, but I'm perfectly happy to have Gaucho in my rotation of sub-hour "super-filler" games. My only knock is that replayability seems suspect, but the game is fun, offers interesting choices, and above all doesn't overstay its welcome.

When my wife saw the artwork for the first time, she immediatly fell in love with all those funny looking cows. The game itself ended up to be light, accesible and fun. And yet, planning your moves ahead is pretty important. And thanks to the beautiful artwork this game just asks to be played. Nice contribution to our collection.

The more I play El Gaucho, the more I enjoy it. The rules are simple enough and there are plenty of tactical decisions to be made. I'm usually not too fond of games in which the 'take that' factor is too high, but this one has just the right amount for me. You can also protect yourself if you pay attention to what the other players are doing. Good timing and your position in relation to the starting player are everything in this game! Well thought out, and truly deserves to be higher up in the BGG rankings.

There is nothing mechanically wrong with El Gaucho.  It works, and it avoids the solitaire dumbness of most worker placement titles.  It's barely even a WP game, frankly, since the board actions  are a secondary mechanic and blockage isn't allowed.

But the game is overly reliant on stealing to rein in the leader, and it leads to statue-grade analysis paralysis.  Both grow annoying over time.

I do recommend that the authors bone up on their English, as all the talk of 'race' in the rulebook has a severe [url=http://www.manitobacooperator.ca/country-crossroads/did-you-know/nazi-cattle-prove-too-hard-to-handle-for-british-farmer/]Nazi[/url] connotation - and the Argentinian setting [i]really[/i] doesn't help. Plus the flavor text on the back of the box is bound to get someone in trouble: 

[i]Mein Gaucho, pass the chili so I can nourish my Aryan muscles.  I have cattle to wrangle and the F&#xFC;hrer is losing patience![/i]

I wasnt expecting anything as I never did heard about this game. I was hapilly surprised by it and will look into playing this title again. It is a nice little worker placement game as you try to enlarge your cow cheptel. But don't wait to long for selling it cause you might get caught selling fewer cows or for a cheaper price then you tought, as there are some thieves around.

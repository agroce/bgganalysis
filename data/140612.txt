There are shades of the better predecessor (Knizia's [b]Lord of the Rings[/b]) here, but what we have here is a game that lacks much of the tension and theme of the old one.  There is much chaos with the dice, that is barely mitigated with the characters and resources.  I just didn't connect with the narrative that much.  Not bad, but not great.

By all rights, I should hate this game, but it's fun. An unapologetic dice chucker, but a fun game never the less. Replays will be few I suspect (until the expansions come out) but it has a not-too-dusty home for now.

LOTR by Reneir Knizia used to be my favorite game but now this is.  I love the cooperative LOTR themed games and the addition of dice plus the ease of set-up and put away combined with the quick play and the ability to play solo or with friends makes this a 10+.  The quality of the components is also excellent.  I also have the Desolation of Smaug add-on and will be trying that soon.

RATING: 8
Players guide Bilbo and the dwarves through the first part of the Hobbit trilogy.  Pleasant cooperative die roller, where players must work together to get through two adventure boards.  The boards contain events from the book/movie, and consist of icons that must be rolled to pass.  A basic turn is a roll of four dice, plus one reroll, but this can be seasoned with the abilities of the dwarves, Bilbo, and/or with precious resources (which keep you moving but cost you final victory points).  

It all sounds rather basic, but a deck of event cards ramps up the tension, putting hazards in the path of the players, or even worse, upgrading challenges to tougher variants.  So tempo must be maintained before the game overwhelmes you.

Very nice cooperative game in an increasingly tired genre.  All the players are engaged, and the levelling system offers a serious challenge to experienced players.  We expect no less from Knizia.

RATING: 9
Brilliant game. Looks simple but once you start playing... Hell's Bells! So many things to consider. Where to commit the dice, when to use the resources and the company etc. As a game, it is classic Knizia - enjoyable game with clean mechanics with a decent playing time. 

Story-wise, The Hobbit is not as strong as Knizia's LOTR though. In The Hobbit, each player's turn is absorbed with one task in the story, and the task usually resolved by that player's turn. There's discussion over what resources to use but generally, it's more a sense of "ok, let's get this done. Next player." In LOTR, players feel far more invested in their collective fate as they work to move the marker through the location. This gives better story immersion and makes the game feel more tense.

Another from Reiner Knizia; mass market game. The board is basically serves a aesthetic function because this a dice allocation game. Juego cooperativo simpático, light y fácil de aprender y jugar. La idea es sobrevivir las pruebas SIN perder todos los puntos con los que comienzas. Si se acaban las fichas de recursos en alguno de los tableros, pierdes.

RATING: 7
Simple, fun coop game. quite similar to Knizia's old Lord of the Rings coop game. Players need to advance the party through, and complete, two scenario boards, using resources from dice rolled, supplemented with one-shot boosts from the dwarves as well as a limitied number of resource cards.

However, resource cards unspent at the end of the game are the primary source for VP, so it's always a dilemma whether to spend a resource or not.

Good, simple gameplay. The graphics range from great (scenario boards, dwarf cards) to completely uninspired (challenges, event cards, resources). Why, oh why couldn't Cryptozoic have used some sort of illustration? Hard to convince my nine-year old son that a blank rectangle showing four red icons is really Bilbo exchanging riddles with Gollum...

Apart from the graphics, a nice, easy, lightweightish game.

RATING: 7.3
Con:

- the artwork of the tasks is not very inspiring and the small letters also hide the story from your eyes.
- yes, it's a dry game in a way, probably does not feel as thematic as other Middle Earth games but that's something you can expect from the designer (and it has the artwork problem, see above).
- Too bad the 2-part game had to be re-designed to be a 3-part game; I think it's going to be (even) better with the planned sequels published.

Pro (and my short opinion) :

The basic mechanism is practically a typical Knizian dice roller category game (nothing great but not bad either). What's built on it is more interesting; lots of cards available for reaching the results, combinations and demanding decisions to be made; events adding company tiles back to your hand making hand management even more interesting etc. Also I like the way the game is scaled for experts and beginners. Also I like how you can help others but with a smaller effect than if you use the cards for yourself.

I like it and am going to buy the sequels.

Well it's Knizia, for sure. The grandchild of his old LOTR co-op (which I have fond memories of, though it hasn't aged particularly well), this one may drop in rating eventually. For now, though, the die-based gameplay works well, plays quickly, and I find the "3-in-1" nature of its release (the game has been released in 3 parts to coincide with the movie) more unique experiment than offensive cash-grab.

Solid game that is much better than the previous Hobbit game from Knizia. Along with Desolation of Smaug, this actually feels like a good companion game to the cooperative LOTR board game. Rather than playing cards, however, you are rolling dice to pass obstacles on each board. Being able to play the entirety of the journey to the Lonely Mountain is something I can really appreciate. I'm not holding out hope for the Battle of Five Armies expansion though. That always felt out of place compared to the rest of the story. What matters is the quest, and ultimately defeating the dragon!

I am still reserving judgement on this game. My initial impression is that it is too easy and does not have a lot of replay value. However, it is moderately fun and smooth playing as well as easy to learn and very quick. A good starter co-op. Perhaps Level 2 or higher play will improve the tension.

Good, relatively quick solo game - never played MP and not much interested either.  Challenging, but due to nature of the movie trilogy this one feels a bit lackluster when the final achievement is "escape with the eagles". 

Nice components apart from printed dice...and the irritating fact that every single card includes copyright small text and every major character has a (TM) after his/her name....in every instance.  Even one face of the dice has copyright details.  I wish I were kidding.  It's ridiculous.

a dice driven coop. not my taste at all. not more sophisticated, but a little bit more complicated than pickomino. nothing much innovative here.  throw two rabbits three dwarves and two axes, complete two tasks with the help of Fili who can double the result of one die. it is coupled to this most commercial and unfortunate film adaptation.

RATING: 6.5
----Preliminary thoughts----

Quite similar to Elder Sign, many of its mechanics are here. Maybe a bit less random, a bit more cooperative (still feels like a Solo game that can accomodate several players), more difficult, but also a bit more abstract (Knizia trademark).

It's also based on scores besides winning and losing.

Replayability is in question?

Nice entry level coop dice manipulation game, but I doubt I'll buy it because I already have Elder Sign + expansion.

It will have a part 2 and 3 after the respective movies.

RATING: 7.5
The Hobbit is essentially Lord of the Rings: the Dice Game, or to be more mechanically accurate, Elder Sign: The Hobbit Edition. Kind of a bummer that they are selling it in three parts, but at the same time it's a pretty tough challenge as-is, so I don't know how often I'd even get past board 2.

Took me 8 tries to win. Fun subtle strategies that aren't apparent at first.

RATING: 7
This is a light, dice-rolling co-op game based on the first film in Hobbit Trilogy. It takes 30 to 45 minutes to play and can accommodate up to four players: like any co-op can be played solo. 

On each turn a player rolls 4 custom dice (transfers rather than engraved) and then matches any symbols with those  on a series of cards (quests) either printed or laid on the board. The player then has the chance to re-roll any remaining dice once and/or try to make up missing symbols using cards in their hands (dwarfs) or cards taken from a shared pool (resources). At the end of the game any unused resources count towards the final score.

For me this game is a good fit. It sets up quickly; is easy to teach and plays fast. The downsides are that, although the theme is there, the cards have no art on them, so you find yourself 'trying to roll 5 beards' rather than 'trying to battle Azog's Warg pack' etc. I strongly suspect that this games will be extremely susceptible to the Alpha Gamer Problem. This isn't a problem at all when you play solo or with someone reasonable (I most play with my very reasonable other half), but might be a risk with a more competitive crowd.

If you're expecting or hoping for anything nearly as sophisticated as Knizia's LotR co-op, your journey's not ended here, just keep walking by. Here we've got a straight-forward, posting it in, doing it by the numbers die-rolling co-op. You've got a number of challenges you need to roll, and you get 4 dice plus one re-roll to get a success each turn or else you're one step closer to group death. One saving grace is that you get a number of abilities, one for each of 14 characters, which are dealt out at the start of each board (you need to succeed in two boards to win). Deciding what to re-roll (ie what challenge you're shooting for) and if/when to use your character is the guts of the game. If you just miss, you can also decide to use one of the special saviour cards, at a cost of VPs, but worth it usually to get closer to the win. Which means the game is a total dice-fest with little to do on anyone else's turn except offer advice. There's the promise of 2 boards per each movie to make the dice-fest go three times as long. Which is for those who want a saga type thing and get their kicks reading out the titles of the card to keep the story alive in their heads, 'cause it sure ain't gonna be the game-play that's gonna keep you at the table for that length of time. I hope they've got some twists coming for these expansions that ramp up the engagement levels accordingly.

RATING: 7
"Good (but not top-notch) co-op. Feels quite abstract (much more so than Knizia's LotR)."

What I like:
- Pure co-op with an appealing theme
- More mitigation of randomness than Elder Sign
- More actual cooperating than Elder Sign
- Some interesting decisions (mostly when to use resources and party members)
- Ability to greatly adjust the difficulty

What I don't like:
- It's abstract (much more so than Knizia's LotR)
- More score-based than win/lose
- Gets a bit repetitive
- Feels a bit incomplete (expansions are on the way)

The physical similarities to LotR are obvious, but LotR is a much more fun game. There are mechanical similarities to Elder Sign, and I think The Hobbit is a better design, but ES feels more thematic.

My learning pretend-2p game took 40 minutes. I think the weight is around 2.0.

RATING: 5
A very cool light gamer. Not too demanding, but still fun. (Please note I have only played the solitaire game.) I have had to make a few adjustments to make it a bit more challenging - like starting with fewer company cards and loading up a few events and upgrades.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A simplistic euro-game with a paper thin theme. Unfortunately the high-quality components are not enough to make you want to play this game a second time. You can either easily beat this game or go for a high score, neither is very rewarding and "winning" feels more like you just completed a puzzle than won a game. This game appeared to have worked its way onto a major retailer's shelves at some point but was quickly demoted to the bargain bin when customers likely felt conned by the nice box art and abstracted game play.

Pros:
* High quality components.

Cons:
* Low replay value.
* The second board's equipment is useless without an expansion and is only used in scoring.

What not to like? 

Get the sequel (Boards 3-4) and embark on a dice-chucking journey full of decisions for a couple of hours! 

Only 3 games in but I already rate it as a great solitaire (play as 2P for hand interaction) and cooperative dice game. In the vein of Elder Sign but the experience is altogether different, if you don't mind a) the austere production compared to FFG's ES and b)'scoring' as opposed to ES's win/lose approach (although I can see losing as a possible outcome here from lvl4).  

Challenge was casual at level 2 but tense all the same (since your score is partly based on the resources you haven't used - you really want to only use those as last resorts; using a lot of them will make the game much easier but your score will take a hit). 
[edit- Lvl4 is preferable once you know the game; just scored 27pts at lvl4 although lost previous such session without leaving board 1; should move on to lvl6 soon). 

Even if finishing board 4 and vanquishing the dragon feels like a proper endgame, I'm still eagerly waiting to see what boards 5-6 are going to be like and what kind of new mechanics will be included.

It might be as good as the lord of the rings co-op, the push your luck element is well done.  It was too short and missing something.  I got 19 pts solo which I guess is not a great score but losing by a few points does not seem the same as lord of the ring when the life is beaten out of you.

I think it's good for a couple plays, but a couple things annoy me.  First, my son didn't care for it too much.  He felt like it was quite punishing, and since you are relying a lot on what you roll, this can be true.  Second, I really don't like that the game was obviously built with the intention that we buy all the expansions to make it a complete game.  Right in the rules, it says to keep playing on the expansion board that to my knowledge is not even out yet.  The game is okay, but this is not a keeper for me.

An interesting Yahtzee-like cooperative game. It bears obvious resemblances to other dice games by Knizia like Risk Express and Sushizock. Also, it has a somewhat similar feel to the Lord of the Rings cooperative boardgame.

I found it an enjoyable experience, where you can easily ramp up the difficulty if things seem too easy. Unfortunately, most of my fellow players seem less enthousiastic.

But why oh why must every individual game component, to the last single tile, need to include a copyright?

A deeply unexciting first play, made worse by the lack of a satisfying ending in the absence of the DoS sequel. This also felt very automatic though since I 'only' scored 17 (and not the 20 required to proceed to the next level of difficulty) perhaps there is more to this than first meets the eye.

The fact that the majority of the points are scored in Area 7 ruins this game for me. Initial Rating 6.5

Read the threads about the race to the rest of the world being a design choice. That the majority of your points will come from areas 6 and 7. Game now feels broken to me. Dropping rating to a 3.

Otro muy buen juego de Wallace,quizás con menos enjundia que otras obras suyas.Mejor a 3 y 4 jugadores,aunque perfectamente disfrutable con variante a 2 (cuadrícula de 9 cartas y se obtiene siempre un token extra de navegación cuando se gane alguno).Aunque el tablero se parezca en el estilo no tiene que ver nada con Automobile

We're trading it away. I was very excited when this game got released since we adore M Wallace's games. But we were not caught by this one. It feels like a more complex Automobile and those last few rounds... well I guess we did not understand. I can't imagine playing Ships when I own Automobile. Quite disappointed.

Quite the disappointment. Standard Wallace fair, somewhat pointless (pun) theme, lack of interesting developments. All the game I am doing the same thing, with the first part being quite unimportant in terms of points and engine building. 

Reminds me a bit of Automobile and Mythotopia (details), but Ships is less fun compared to both. It's just nothing special. :(

Kinézetre és működésben is hasonlít az Automobile-hoz, de kevésbé bonyolult.
Ami hiba, hogy a tábla szélén, a hajóknál a 11 kort jobban elkülöníthették volna egymástól, hatalmas grafikai baki volt így kiadni a játékot. Még a 2 és fél órás parti végén is bogarászni kellett, hogy melyik kor melyik. Értem én, hogy a hajók nevei más színűek a szomszédos korokon, és az is megvan, hogy szélrózsákkal vannak elválasztva a korok, de akkor is... Nem látszik kapásból, és ez zavaró. A másik, bődületes nagy hiba, hogy a partinkban a III. típusú hajók korszaka véget érhetett olyan gyorsan, hogy egyik játékosnak egyáltalán nem volt akciója abban a korban!!! Szinte hihetetlen, ilyen kaliberű szerzőtől nem várnék ilyet. Gyakorlatilag valaki kimaradhat egy komolynak tűnő eurogémben a játéknak egy akkora részéből, ami papíron kb. az 1/3-ada.
De hogy jót is mondjak: bár elsőre zavaró volt, hogy a korok közti ugrások a tábla szélén és közepén egymástól tök függetlenül történnek, de összességében jól működött ez a része. Végig arra készült mindenki, hogy majd a tábla közepi 7. korban szerezzük a sok pontot, de végül is a gyors befejezés miatt ott csak egyetlen játékos tudott akciót végrehajtani:) A tábla szélén történő korváltás egyébként túl egyértelműnek tűnik, magasan azok nyertek, akik azt rendre végre tudták hajtani, tehát a szélrózsa tűnt így egy parti alapján a játék kulcsának. Egyébként leszámítva ezt a játékvégi bakit, és a grafikai hiányosságot, tök jól működnek az akciók, egy kicsivel több tesztelés nem ártott volna, és akár sikeres játék is lehetett volna.
A kártyák kellenek bele, de a szöveges részt esetleg grafikusan is megoldhatták volna?!
Összességében ajánlom a Wallace rajongóknak, nem vészes annyira, inkább csak bosszantó... nem sok kellett volna...

First Play: High expectations for this and savagely disappointed. All the scrimping and saving in the first 2 1/2 hours of this game stand for nothing when the very last turn hauls 52 points for the player who just sinks his hoarded black cubes into the final market. Sure four equally skilled players would know this but add one less experienced player and their mistakes hand the game to the next man.

It seems that Mr W's new play test posse don't have an attitude along the lines of 'lets try to break this' whereas I always got the impression that strange tactics had been second guessed in the pre NZ past.

The game just doesn't seem to hang together and plays an hour too long for its repetitive mechanic. There is a core fan base for these games with an in joke attitude but I'm afraid it looks like I stopped getting that joke  after Brass . Open for offers to take it off my hands.

Our last game of the night, this was a 2 player battle between Brian and I. I lost 208-203. Let's face it, I am a sucker for Martin Wallace games. I really love his designs. You can look at my Top 100 of all time and see that I have at least 5 of his games in there. Well, this will be the next one to be added. What a deep game! You have to decide early on if you are going to focus on moving discs (Warships) or cubes (Galleys) over to the central part of the board. These give 1 time benefits but also score VP's once someone moves up to the next numbered section on the board. By removing discs, you open up additional spots in your warehouse to store resources or your bank to store coins. The ship track is another thing to manage. A player can pace or upgrade a ship to the next Age of Sail by spending tokens (acquired on the main board). First into a new age gets you VP. If your ships are 2 or 3 ages behind you will lose VP's when a new Age is started, Of course, there are ways to mitigate this. Also, there are 12 cards that enter the game when 1 of the 3 eras is entered. These cards can be extremely powerful (as Brian discovered). They can let you sell goods for extra money and VP's, upgrade ships for free, etc. So yes, I love this! A very deep strategic game really works for me from time to time and Wallace's designs are the ones I keep coming back to. Also, like most Martin Wallace games, it works incredibly well with 2 players. Highly recommended. 

PS: Also, this would be in my Top 10 Favorite Boards list, if I ever made one. It is beautiful.

I like some of Wallace's older designs, especially games like Brass and Steam. Ships seems to have quite a mixed response like most of Wallace's recent work. Overall, I liked how it worked. After the game, we discussed how it all just builds up to the final scoring area. Without playing more with 3 and 4 players I can't be sure, but we felt like maybe the best number to play the game is three.

I like the mechanic where you uncover your wharehouse/banking capacity by playing the cities to the map (though, it's similar to other games like Terra Mystica).  I didn't like the end game at all though - maybe because we rushed through map to the final area.  It made sense in our 3 player game for the player behind in scoring to close off the area - but it created a really crazy and kind of stupid end game where the final area was scoring 100+ points.  Very underwhelming.  Probably would have been better if your were more limited on the Steamships.

The Area 7 ruins the game!
The rate of this game is 7.  It becomes 8.5 after using the following variants.

Variants have to implement to save this game...
1. Before the start of the game distribute an equal number of era I cards to each player and remove the extras. Each player keeps one then passes the rest on clockwise (7 Wonders style). Each player will then have their own stash of cards. The action that says "Take 1 card" will now be interpreted as "Play 1 card". ---Suggested by Jacob Lee
2. Max. 2 Discs for each player can be put in the area 7 and there is no limitation of putting merchant cubes in area 7.

Remarks (Easy to forget rules)
----------
1. All goods at the end of the game can be freely converted to gold and convert to VP accordingly without using selling action.
2. Equal turn; the end game condition will be triggered if there are 5 or more ships in the last 2 ship boxes.
3. The VPs can be earned from surplus gold coins (2 golds to 1 VP exchange rate) by selling goods after completing all inventory space. i.e. only surplus gold coins can be used to trade VPs.  
4. All black cubes or navigation tokens changing from oil or iron should be used immediately after converting.
5. Each player can play only one card in his/her turn.
6. Merchant cubes and warship discs can only be placed in  the latest regions.  After triggering the new region, cubes cannot be placed in old regions.
7. No negative points
8. Black cubes can be used anytime but removed them after using it.

RATING: 7.5
Here's a hopeful 7.5.  There's lots of interesting stuff happening in Ships, but it may be too tactical to hold any long term interest locally. I never felt like I was working towards a specific strategy or that my earlier actions had real consequences.  For the moment, I prefer Automobile which seems to offer a much wider space for  both strategic maneuver.  

That said, I also felt as if there might be something else going on when it comes to tempo management that we just missed.  There were some shades of Lewis and Clarke here in the action-chaining, but with a weird obsolescence system replacing the deck drafting of L&C.  I'm a little confused by the whole thing.  I'm sure I'll have more to say after a few more plays.

Update:
Here's an interesting game of tempo management that I found more exhausting than engaging.

This comment is bound to change as more plays roll in.

Ships is an odd duck. At first it just looks like the progression track from Martin's earlier offering Automobile. At second someone figures out that there are massive VPs to be had at the very end of the Area track. And then the waters divide. You have on the one side the people who proclaim this idea to be broken, and move on to other things. On the other are the people who understand that this means that the game has to be played [i]backwards[/i], with players forcing themselves to keep up with the rest lest the VP deltas become too big, and the final scoring presenting them with an insurmountable difference. Currently I belong to the second class of gamers, if anything for the sheer balls to create something with this difficult to master design pattern. There aren't many games out there which use it!

Unfortunately this also means that nearly by definition Ships is a game which needs to be played a lot of times before you can say anything at all about its good and bad qualities. So there is no rate to accompany this comment yet.

An interesting game, that whilst difficult to engage with who we are meant to represent in the game, still manages to present a surprisingly good analogy for the constant struggle for relevance against the constant tide of obsolescence and technological progress. The game is tense and fast, and despite it's thematic dryness, a lot of fun. Punshing you for both overcommitting and for failing to engage, this is a game that you can learn and develop with.

Ships deals with the history of shipping, from the time of the Phoenicians to the modern era. The game is divided into three ages, marked with different ship types. The first age is that of the galley, followed by the age of the galleon, then finally the steamship age. The board combines a track showing the development of ships, similar to that in Automobile, with a map of Europe and an area representing the rest of the world.

The main mechanics are interesting and provide a fun and engaging game experience. The merchant-cube/action point cycling is good although there is ample opportunity here for the AP gifted to have a field day and take playing times way beyond what the game justifies.

There are a couple of functional flies in the ointment, in the form of some dubious icon choices, a lack of colour differentiation between the blue player-colour and the black of the free action cubes (a minor niggle). The way the free action cubes are portrayed on the player board is not exactly consistent with the player-cubes. The ages could be more clearly distinguished on the player board - which otherwise looks terrific. And there is some 'loose' wording on the cards - but nothing major.

There is also a potential issue with a bias towards the last player coupled to over-rewarding warship placement into the the final region. Will be watching for this on future plays. The latter definitely feels like a problem although it could just be something the players have to bear in mind when playing - although I'm not sure whether I like the idea that the game is less about what you do during the first three-quarters of play and all about how you position yourself for the end game.

UPDATE - after more plays I am inclined to think the RotW points issue is not an issue and is just something you need to be aware of and take into account - it may not be to everyone's liking but it provides an interesting tension to the game. The turn order bias is probably there - not insurmountable but a slight niggle.

I was a little apprehensive about Ships given the luke warm reception it had received from some quarters. But others gave it the thumbs up and my games group was keen to get it to the table. The good news is that Ships is brilliant! It is a real return to form for Martin Wallace. 

The game goes along at a fair pace, never being dull and rarely slowing down despite the fact that there is often a fair bit to do in a turn. The decisions are the often agonising and the strategies and tactics are always interesting.

You are continually building and evolving your ships whilst simultaneously discovering the world via the sea. The places you go determine the resources you get and the points you score. The game mechanics are too complex to summarise meaningfully here, but rest assured they are fairly intuitive and easy to grasp.

There has been criticism from some people as to the sheer number of points that can be scored in the end-game rounds. I would disagree that this ‘breaks’ the game as has been mooted. Instead I think it is a very clever mechanic which Mr Wallace has employed to allow a catch-up against opponents who take an early lead. There is enough in the end game to allow you to catch up an early leader but by no means so much that you need to ignore the rest of the game and solely concentrate on the end game. In fact in the game I played the winner was the one who built up points throughout the game rather than the player who went ‘all-in’ for end-game riches.


The downsides?
-Probably plays best with three, four may lead to downtime issues
-The shipping theme is not as strong as the likes of Automobile, Brass or Tinners Trail: the game is fairly abstract and dry.
-The end-game can get fiddly and involve long turns when you are using extra free actions (which have different payment terms).

But they are minor downsides, this really is a very good game indeed; Wallace’s finest since A Study In Emerald for sure.

2015-11-09 : Finally, after many crappy games in the past couple of years, Martin Wallace strikes gold again with Ships. Nice interlocking mechanics, having to pay attention to not only your own plans, but also making sure you're not setting up a big score for your opponent(s), relatively easy rules, but deep strategy - everything you can ask for in a good solid heavy euro. The only serious minus point, apart from the rules, is the board layout of the various ages - these are simply confusing and it's something that is so easily fixed you have to wonder who vetted that board. Played this with 2, can see this working well with 3, but wouldn't play this with 4

Felt like a mix of Automobiles (the tense pressure of the game to keep pushing you forward and punish those not keeping up with technology) and Concordia (the limited space for goods collecting). So far, I like it.

So the endgame race for Rest of the World points is the ostensible fun of the game. Can you get there early and often before the other players force the end of the game and vice versa? After the initial light-bulb play, all players should go in knowing this is the deal and be on even footing. 

But whether or not that is fun is secondary for me to the construction of the game. This design reminds me far too much of Wallace’s Aeroplanes for how annoyingly tactical it is. It’s a highly tactical puzzle that you have to reconfigure each turn. And since you have little ability to plan ahead because so much changes, players can’t be faulted for having to spend considerable time sorting out the puzzle other players have left them at the start of their turn. The time between turns in a 4P game is between 5-10 minutes. I just didn’t enjoy playing this game on a turn-to-turn basis.

What’s worse, the game rewards hoarding and mega-turns. You can hoard most, if not all, your free actions and then have a 10 minute super turn where you keep turning things in to put out ships in Era 7 and then get more goods to put out more ships and then get more goods and … And you'll score a ton of points. One player tripled his score with this mega-turn. It's so the way to go. 

Consequently, I’m not inspired by this design. I get that the end of the game is a race and you can try to extend or shorten the game by your actions, but I don’t find it interesting to spend a chunk of the game on elements that feel inconsequential by game end. Who cares about those 6 points in the Eastern Med? I don’t want to set it up and play again to find out if I can get into Europe before anyone else because that doesn't matter. It’s all about the endgame in era 7 and who can hit that hardest. The rest of the game is merely prologue for that part.

Ships is a game of timing more than anything else. That - inevitably? - makes it a very tactical game, especially thanks to the ever accelerating scoring progression. In a way - and somewhat paradoxically - Ships is a game on rails. Your journey through the eras and continents is entirely scripted, the only question remaining is "when?"

That doesn't make the game any less interesting on the first play but I do wonder how much it will really change from game to game. In any case, I suspect it runs a little long for the amount of in-game variation. Simply dropping a couple of eras and continents might not have hurt much.

Somewhat related to the timing considerations but more of a concern is a strong tendency to become unhinged towards the end of the game. The final region in particular, combined with the way the game ends, can be a huge advantage for players later in turn order. Things don't necessarily have to play out that way, but there isn't too much the players early in turn order can do about it when it comes to it, either. While I like the rest of the game, this area seems like a fairly big design blunder to me.

Ships is the second Martin Wallace game I fell for, the first being London. It seems to take a lot of flack for not being Automobile but looking and sounding similar to that game. Personally, I like Ships more. 

PROS
-Good amount of player interaction. Of course, it's got denial but the mechanic of pushing through to the next age to create obsolescence and pushing through to the next region for area scoring makes for some tense moments. 
-Fairly simple rules.
-Board & component are are thematic and look great!

CONS
-No tie-breaker.
-Even with a point tracker, it is difficult to get a sense of how you are doing in the game as there are turns, specifically in region scoring, where you can get 20+ points in one swoop.

Typical Martin Wallace - he's either brilliant or terrible. This one is the latter.

2 years in the delivery and it's utterly dull now that it's here. A total let down.

I think he's tried to roll up all the best points of Automobile and others and combine them - unfortunately it doesn't tie well together. Never has my hobby been more aptly described as "cube pushing".

RATING: 7
(12/05/2015) Comment based on one play.

Martin Wallace revisits the outer technology progress track mechanism in Automobile and rethemes it for ships, while adding in a historically abstracted area expansion element. There are two interesting sets of "progress" tracks that are parallel with other, one showing the progress of ship technology, and the other showing the progress of expansion into the world. 

The expansion conveys a similar feel of Navagador, Age of Renaissance, and History of the World, as players start in the eastern Mediterranean with primitive galleys, and working their way through the western Mediterranean, north and western Europe, crossing the Atlantic, and reaching China and India with steam ships. Players establish merchant outposts or cities in order to gain goods, gold, or other kinds of bonuses. It is fascinating to see the board develop over time, as well as watch the rise and fall of ship types.

At the same time, players are in a constant technology race in creating new ship types, either merchant or warship, which allow the creation of these outposts or cities, respectively. The ship progress track is separated into 11 "ages", with each age having two spots: one for merchant and the other warship. Players march along this track until five ships are created in the 11th age. There are incentives in VP for a player to develop the "first" ship of a given age, as well as VP penalties for those who have older or obsolete ships.

Although many of the mechanisms may be familiar, some are tied together meaningfully and interestingly, but uniquely such that one can tell this is a "Wallace" game.

The components are standard Treefrog, good and sturdy. Plenty of wooden bits and a gorgeous board. However, functionally, the board is somewhat lacking, as it is very easy to get confused as to what ships are in what age, or whether it is the Age of Sail or the Age of Steam. It seems artwork emphasizing theme has taken precedence over clarity, but that too, seems to be a Wallace trademark. Rules are somewhat clear, with sometimes confusing explanations, but can be worked through with patience. The gameplay itself is relatively simply and clear, much less complex than Brass or London.

Based on one play, I found the game to be a frustrating experience. It seems to be an economic snowball, with very little chance at a catchup mechanism. Not sure if it was because it was a 4-player game, but the first player always seemed to be in a position to break into the new age and score the bonus VP. The total of all the bonuses around the progress track is around 50 VP, and whomever was behind the curve was penalized about 10 VP, for a 60 point spread at the end. The downtime was somewhat excessive for 4-player, although this should improve with more plays. It took about 30-45 minutes for a cold rules explanation, and about 3.5 hours for our first game. Still, it felt like the game overstayed its welcome by about an hour. The game starts slowly at first, but takes a while to get going.

Eventually, it is a rather repetitive repeating of placing and upgrading ships, over and over, with very little variation in between, so it does become tiresome after awhile. Grabbing a card or selling goods gives some spice, but that the turn order is fixed is somewhat disconcerting. The remaining three players felt like it was almost impossible to break out of the "loop" where we were collectively setting up the first player to break into the next level. Perhaps players must make a concerted effort to leapfrog ahead to break the cycle?

Initial rating: "7". I don't have much patience for economic snowball type games, and cannot see a way to break the "loop". Brass and London continue to be Wallace's best designs IMHO, along with Railroad Tycoon in the railroad arena. A Study in Emerald is his best, unique design in the past few years. At this point, as similar cousins, I like Automobile (and Aeroplanes, for that matter) more than Ships. I am willing to give it one more play.

Medium heavy Euro with well known mechanics. Not very thematic. I like this game a lot but can see why some people would not. This is classic Martin Wallace. I can say with a high degree of certainty that if you liked Brass or Age of Industry you will like this. If you did not like those other games, you are unlikely to like this.

This seems to get better with more plays.  I'm happy with the 2p & 3p game.

It's the type of game that you analyse after you've played it & make a hypothesis for next time.

Be ready for the end game & don't overdo things in early, low scoring areas.

This was still in prototype. It has an Automobile ship development track, and a map of areas and ports.

Most of the actions incrementally improve one's position by getting you more resources, money, control on the board etc. But there are occasions when you can make major changes to the game state by moving the game forward to the next stage either on the ship track or by entering a new region on the map. Timing these changes to ones own advantage or anticipating that one of your opponents might trigger such a change seem to be the key to the game. Managing all the resources and timing the major events of the game are both things I enjoy in games.

RATING: 3
Hugely disappointing.  Getting additional action cubes is imperative, but it's easy to get blocked from doing so.  If this happens, you're screwed because you have to spend many turns doing nothing except resetting your board.  Also, game is far too long for what it is and the game board graphic design is awful.

Very smart, very tactical game where the timing is essential.  Possibly the most tactical Wallace's game (Aeroplanes being the other bidder).

There are some issues (very mechanical; totally irrelevant theme; with 4 players the game will be too long (AP) and out of control), but two first ones are meaningless for me when the mechanics is engrossing (as here) and I don't need to play with 4.

Readability of the ship track should've been BETTER - boundaries of periods (levels) and eras are pain in the a#$.

Mechanically solid, best as a 3player, strategy isn't that deep, and the end game is a little odd.

Although I was afraid with the downtime, the feelings before playing were good for all the players. Unfortunately, during the game we found much more shortcomings: players found themselves doing the "practically forced" action again and again, waiting for the ending, which is absolutely anticlimactic. I would prefer a thousand times to play Automobile or London before this one, to give two examples.

RATING: 5
Tedious.  Put stuff down; take points.  Again and again.  I found little opportunity for clever or strategic play.  The one nice element was management of action cubes.  Each action requires the use of a cube from a limited supply, and some actions also take cubes out of play.  Then it takes an action to recycle the cubes for reuse.  So there is some planning around keeping your supply strong and timing the recycles.

I was trailing FAR behind for the entire game.  Then at the very end, I was able to open a portal to a high scoring opportunity where I scored about 1/3 of my entire game's points in a single turn and overtook the leader.  I didn't think I did anything particularly strategic to get this windfall.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Astonishingly strong left-right binding although far more subtle than in Puerto Rico but potentially as decisive. Through most of the game I didn't really notice how important the seating order can be. When I noticed it was too late and I was caught with a too similar setup as the player in front of me. It didn't help that the player in front of him didn't fight for the decisive advances to the next age. Reading through the comments, other groups experienced the same problem of the same player repeatedly being able to break into the next age with four.

The game also can have severe AP issues. To realize its potential, it's one of these games that needs experienced quick players. Otherwise, it's a three-hour slog with a good chance for getting frustrated. Which is too long for the limited amount of variation throughout the game. A pity, as there's a lot to like here. Getting the timing right, small tactical races for cards and positions, subtle player interaction. The deepest game of the transport trilogy, although I prefer the other two games, Automobile and Aeroplanes.

A opinion after a first play, it was the first play for all four players.
It is just boring. At first the mechanics felt fresh and interesting, but after a couple of rounds it is over. You make the whole game the same things: place a ship, get wares, get influence on the map, get VP. Done - next age: Place ships, discs, cubes get VP and so on. It doesn't really matters in which age you are, or what kind of ship you actually have. It is always the same. Moreover with four players there is a long, long downtime. After 2h I was out of the game, me it has no longer interested. The whole duration of the game was 3,5h.  A pity, i like Brass or A few Acres of Snow, but there is much more history and diversity, here i felt nothing.

I love Steam, but few other Martin Wallace games have really grabbed me. I often find them to be pretty cold, bland, stats-driven stuff. As Ships hit the table and was explained, I didn't expect I'd get much out of it. Yet something about it did work for me. Don't get me wrong, it's still very much a Martin Wallace design (though without some of the historical minutiae baggage his games often feature), but it's actually approachable, engaging, and -- dare I say it -- fun. The graphic design of the board could use some work, however, and it's not without some troubling flaws, but this is something I'd rather play than much of the other Wallace stuff that's come out recently.

Even my love for games about ships doesn't quite save this one. 

It's interesting up until you get to the point where you actually score most of the points. If you participated in the interesting part then you have less left for the boring part at the end. Also the boring part at the end is really the way you win the game so if you're playing to win you must take the least interesting route to do so.

Atypical and more streamlined than it'd seem at first glance.

Doubts:

2) will the game still be interesting after ten times (it looks like it gets quite repetitive)?
3) will the game be any good with two?

Currently interested to find the answers playing it a bit more, but suspecting it'll be one of those "nice, but not great" games that will thus fade into oblivion.

Rating of 8.5 is provisional after three plays.  This may be one of Wallace's best, but I have concerns about the importance of player order, i.e. that going last is beneficial in the end game.  Time will tell.

Edit:  Definitely not one of his best.  Player order turns out to be far too important introducing an unwanted element of luck that cannot be mitigated.

A cool engine building game from Martin Wallace. Quite stressful (in a nice way), mechanisms to move the game forward constantly.

Really fun and interesting unique powers in the cards you can get, although some of them seem so very powerful at times.

Seems to be balance issues with being the last player (as in it's easy to win if you're last). Needs more playing to be sure though.

Played at PAX Aus 2014 with the great man himself, Martin Wallace. 99% complete pre-release prototype. Loads of meat. A far more rewarding experience than Automobile. This I would play again, whereas Automobile would take more convincing. Don't feel as though you are being beat up upon as when you make a move affecting other players, it affects them all. A true Treefrog game, worthy of its place amongst the best titles from that collection.

Very surprised by this one. The gameplay is extremely repetitive and the pacing seems off. While the age track is tied to the exploration map, the latter seems to move much faster than the prior. It feels like the motivation to advance on the age track is too small and the game drags down to its minimum speed. I'm afraid this game is rather boring.

Update: Got a rule wrong. Need to play again to reevaluate.

The best Martin Wallace design I've played in recent years. This needs additional plays but I liked our first game, an interesting balance between getting more action cubes, adding cities and markets to increase your storage, and keeping up with the ship rush.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
the game is easy to understand but it won't be easy to master because it's a game of "Timing", it really does matter When a certain Action is performed... should you trigger the change of Age in The Ship Track? Or is it better to upgrade some ships to not be hit so hard with the negative points?
Should I change Region now so I can be the first to occupy spaces on the new Area despite scoring fewer points now, or should I continue to place in the current one to score better when the scoring is triggered?
should I take this card that allows me to score some points but that will slow my upgrading strategy because I can use another card to upgrade?

awesome awesome choices to be made!

---------------

EDIT:
Everything above is true but the game is broken with the unlimited number of actions you can do in one turn when you got black cubes stored that you can exploit in the end part of the game to trigger it's end and score a bunch of points...
It can be easily fixed with house rules but, come on, where's the play testing? How didn't anyone caught this? Very sloppy work there! 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
A dry, swingy euro with a dissatisfying end-game.  So many points are available in late game scoring rounds that early advantages are meaningless.  Frequently advancing the age is more advantageous for the next player: this creates 2 problems for me: (1) You are strategically encouraged to hold back and (2) a weak player can give a huge advantage to the player on their left.

I really disliked the constant pressure to upgrade or abandon old ships, but I realize that's a feature, not a bug.  The same cannot be said of this game's numerous other flaws.  The rewards for cube placement in the early game are chicken feed compared to what you can get for a similar investment in the later game, the spice option is useless, and the cards that grant four extra cubes are wildly overpowered.  That last one is particularly obvious.  I'm very surprised that Mr. Wallace has produced something so haphazard and unbalanced after so many years of designing games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Very much a heavy Wallace in the vein of Automobile (forced obsolescence) with London's card artwork. For lovers of strategy, it's to its credit that the strategy is abstruse. Action-point allowance, with limited actions per turn, ensures plenty of agonizing AP. It was definitely fun to learn, but I'm a bit wary of playing again, at least with 2. Not to say that it wouldn't also feel chess-like with more players, but that quality arose enough in the 2er to turn me off. There's also a sense that crucial turning points occur from opponents' errors, such as placing a merchant rashly, overlooking a card, not grokking the mix of goods available in the current era, etc.

Variants have to implement to save this game...
1. Before the start of the game distribute an equal number of era I cards to each player and remove the extras. Each player keeps one then passes the rest on clockwise (7 Wonders style). Each player will then have their own stash of cards. The action that says "Take 1 card" will now be interpreted as "Play 1 card". ---Suggested by Jacob Lee
2. Max. 2 Discs for each player can be put in the area 7 and there is no limitation of putting merchant cubes in area 7.

RATING: 7.5
Solid Wallace game. Not sure if it is completely balanced though. The end-scoring in the '7th rest of the world continent' is too strong and seems to eliminates all players in round before the one reaching it first. It could be just timing, so have to play it more for a better judgement.

RATING: 6
Paulo and I are big fans of Mr. Wallace's work; he always manages to make thematic and brilliant games, albeit with unsexy titles and concepts. But his mechanics always add a unique and fresh approach to strategy and gameplay. All this to say, we were excited about playing his newest venture, Ships where players develop industries of naval vessels (merchants or war ships) from the Phoenician age to the modern one. There is card-drafting and pick-up-and-deliver "ports" for your ships, all based around "actions" in a worker placement model. This sounds incredibly dry but turns are fast and easy to strategize. Unfortunately, the game ends halfway through its actually over. Half the game is spent sending your fleet to various countries, picking up goods for points (the rarest of them offering the maximum number of points) but once the map has been explored, and therefore exploited, the game sort of dies and can bore players. Your choices and resources are limited and so is your race for points. I couldn't believe a game devised by a master designer ended up being only half-created...there was only half a game present. I guess it thematically makes sense: when the whole world is explored, what else is there to conquer or prove? Man, what a downer of game.

Have played twice now and that made two somewhat different games. This is a nice game that work well but maybe a bit repetitive. I really like the use of action cubes that runs out and you need to plan when and how to retreive them. 

As usual with Wallace it's a beautiful game with excellent component quality.

RATING: 6
Quite a bit more abstract than many of Wallace's other titles. In Brass for instance, it feels like you are building and expanding your industry and you are very aware of your net worth as the game progresses. In Ships, however, you don't feel like you are doing anything that remotely feels like nautical exploration.  I don't completely fault that however since Knizia is my favorite designer and it is easy to forget theme in many of his better titles.  Ships does have some other faults, though.  One, the game is too long for what it is.  It overstays its welcome and becomes quite repetitive. Two, I am one that is not completely sold on the scoring system. If seems imperative to save as much as possible for the final age.  This is so true it makes you wonder why you even played the first 90 minutes.  This may be due to inexperience,  but even with more plays, I think the issue of the game being a tad long will still hold true.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Ships is a Martin Wallace game where he took the technology advancement from Automobile and attached an entirely new game to it. Here you are building merchant ships and warships, claiming spots on the board to get various resources. It's really all about managing your action cubes--if you have too few you can screw yourself out of actions, and if you can come up with bonus actions, that's great, especially near the end of the game when you can do stuff worth tons of points. It turns out to be a very tactical game, as board state changes immensely from turn to turn (I even missed entire "ages"). I do wish there was a little more opportunity for long-term planning.

Solid game. A little wide open with 2 players but still plays well. The first game will be sort of a learning game. Subsequent games will have more strategy behind every move. The cubes can become somewhat crowded on some areas, but attention and planning should avoid any mishaps.
   I guess this game is all about resource management and expanding your holds on your player board. Getting merchants into cities and then placing a city is where some extra points will be picked up. Great game :D

(Finally) A more heavier game of Martin Wallace. Timing of retrieving your cubes is very crucial in this game.

Edit 15/04/2016: Played the game twice now. Twice I was starting player and twice I was fucked by this as the 3rd player trigger's the game end and unlocks the next area where only he and the last player can score big points. So again the last player wins. This seems to be fucked up?

Reminded me of Automobiles but not as good. There is some area control and interesting scoring with that. I felt it was a bit longer than I wanted it to be. There seems to be a lot of critical timing in this game which I like but you can easily be hosed. I may play it again but don't think I will request it ever. Glad I didn't blind buy it.

In this game, players place ship tokens along the outside of the track to either drop a cube into a goods slot in the central board, or place a disk on a disk spot in the central board. Every time a ship gets placed, it reduces the token cost to place a ship in the next area. The first player to enter a new area gets some bonus points, and players who have ship tokens in previous eras lose some points. It's possible to spend your actions and resources to remove old boats or move old boats into new eras, but it's a strategy decision in terms of if that's your most efficient move or not. There are also areas in the central map. When a new area there gets entered, the previous era scores. Each era scores one more point per thing that the era before it, so at the beginning of the game each spot is producing roughly 2vp per thing, but at the end of the game it goes up to 7 per. 

This brings me to the one thing holding me back from loving this game. Getting into the last area is so valuable. If the last area only gets entered in the final round, there's a chance whoever was unlucky enough to come earlier in turn order won't get a chance to put into there before the game ends. This usually means that the starting player is at a strange disadvantage, only in this once instance, and yet it's important enough that it could mean that if they aren't careful they might lose by virtue of only that. I'm not saying it's impossible for players earlier in turn order to win, but it seems like they need to know to play in such a way that they are the ones to open up that last area, AND that the game ends on that turn, which is a lot to ask.

--Nov2015-- I'm a bit disappointed on the first play.  It was interesting (in the abstract) but not compelling:  there were too many butterfly-effect transitions that I experienced, but had no ability to predict or control.  I expect - somewhat like my experience of [thing=114912][/thing] - that the game will do better with additional play:  the question is whether I can find opponents that are willing to make the attempt!
--Jan2016-- Distinctly better with 3 players - to the extent that I might only (in future) choose to play with that number.

RATING: 7
Oh dear! What a fantastic game this could have been. Unfortunately during our plays we've encountered a few issues.

Firstly it would have been nice for the rules to highlight a few of the main points and the board to display the information a bit clearer. There are little things here, like if you're the player looking at the board upside down it can be a bit confusing which merchant and warship combo are in the same age. Why not write the age at the top of both boxes or across both boxes? (Yes, the names are colour coded, but still.) The player mats could indicate the Free Action Cubes come from the pool - print "From pool" on the player mat. Or why not just have them move directly into your stock and save the shuffling around? Or optimally go a step further and have a completely seperate stock box for Free Action cubes with the number to be added to this box during each respective age? The regions of the map could come with slightly different shaded backgrounds. Little things that would just make the information and bookkeeping a little easier to follow.

As a positive on the rules I like the general style and tone. Telling readers not to panic when explaining the place ship action is a nice touch. Just some Alea style side bullet point highlights would make things even easier to follow.

Our two main issues with the game are to do with the Free Action Cubes and the value differences of the cards. Sometimes (or usually), these two issues are interlinked.

1. The Free Action cubes can be hoarded. Nothing completely wrong with that - some surprise turns are a good thing... within reason. Aside from the fact that the stock can run out from the pool there is an issue with mega long turns. (Turns that go over about eight or so actions are just a bit of a drag for the other gamers at the table.) I'd like to see a simple fix here, like players only being able to use a maximum of one Free Action Cube more than they acquired during the turn (perhaps with the exception of Oil Counter exchanges). The hoarding of Free Action Cubes just makes sense when Age 7 on the map is worth a straight up six points upon placement followed by a game end seven points for your warships and Merchant Cubes, plus the guaranteed bonus for each Merchant Cube. Except for the odd opportunistic acquiring of certain counters, or pushing an age forward, why use the Free Action Cubes when they're worth half as much?

Here's what I inflicted upon my opponents during my final ten minute long game turn with fourteen hoarded Free Action Cubes, about eight navigation tokens, some goods and money, with five disks sitting around saved up (as the last player) - it went something like this: Build warship (open up Area 7 on map using a few navigation tokens), build warship, remove ship (from previous era), remove ship (from previous era), build warship (open up steam era 11), sell goods, build warship, upgrade warship, remove ship (from previous era), remove ship (from previous era), build Merchant Ship (using industry to get two cloth), sell goods, remove ship (from previous era), build Merchant Ship (using industry to get two cloth), retrieve Merchant Cubes (& industry counters), build Merchant Ship (using industry to get two cloth), build Merchant Ship (using industry to get two cloth). Somewhere in there a card was purchased to cut the cost of an action. So that's five Warships getting 13 points each, four Merchant ships for another 28 points, plus 20 points for the Merchant cube/Warship bonus. Plus eight points for opening Steamship era 11 (minus a couple of negative points). All unanswered by my poor opponents because it's game over. Now I was behind in points to start with, and I didn't win by as much as I thought I would, but the turn was probably rather boring/frustrating to watch and drawn out. Plus it just seems against the spirit of play. I'd like to house rule against these moves, but not many people I play with are keen on house rules for any game. So the mega turn will continue to rear its ugly head.

2. The card balance is rather off balance (especially when it's combined with a Free Action Cube mega turn). Just as one example, I've seen a player trigger the steam era age cards, place six ships in the Great Western Merchant Ship box (buying double cloth using their Industry counter, selling some goods for cash along the way) and scoring 24 VP (plus adding six merchant cubes in the six point area for another 36+ VP down the track). Now that's a really good move and even though long turns tend to put the other players to sleep it's appreciated by all players at the table... except when the fourth player to the right of the Free Action Cube hoarder comes to have her turn and the best card left is a slight discount on upgrades, or even adding an extra merchant cube. Then it seems a little off. There's a few cards around that with prior knowledge you'll be waiting to strike for some big benefits. (Cards like "British Empire", where you'll be smiling if you left your cloth Merchant Cubes out on the map.)

(Just a note about the cards: In my copy of the game the Era cards don't match the abilities written in the rules. Steam Era "Industry" cards have three industry tokens on the cards as opposed to two tokens in the rules. "Shipyards" have four merchant cubes on the cards instead of two in the rules. "Refrigeration" is four VP per ship on the cards versus three VP in the rules. "British Empire" is two gold and two VP for each cloth merchant as opposed to two gold and one VP in the rules. I prefer the values in the rules, but we play as written on the cards.)

The moral of the story is to grab all the oil you can and use it to exchange for Free Action Cubes (for immediate use), save all the Free Action cubes you can and hold off on using them in bulk until your merchant cubes hit the five or six VP areas if you see a good opportunity, or the end if you've managed to save a good stack of discs. But I don't like the game played like this. It seems like it was never intended that people would play it quite like this. So it seems a simple restriction on just how many Free Action Cubes can be used in a turn would be a good refinement of the game.

So, I would like to love this game. It's got some lovely choices and some brain melting planning that leaves me feeling wrung out. Just a few little tweaks. A nip and a tuck away from greatness. Sadly it leaves me annoyed at players hoarding 12 little black cubes and then taking mega 15 minute turns as we are launched through maybe two ages of shipping and various scoring before it comes around to my turn again. I don't like to see the game played like this, but it's so damn effective that you can't fault the logic. Everyone is trying to do their best after all, so why not? It seems we are only limited in our ambitions by our stock of little black cubes.

A good, sound Euro. I'd maybe have liked it better a few years ago - there's just so many great games available these days. I disliked the board layout. I feel that the ages should be more clearly delineated. The 11 ages, split into 2, for war and merchant, were 22 boxes of equal size. I feel that 11 boxes, split perhaps by a diagonal line, would have made things much clearer - similarly the different phases for the cities, and the costs to upgrade to the next one, were not as clear as they could have been. Good game though, with plenty strategic options available.

1 play, 4er, all newbies, with at least one REALLY SLOOOOW player -- our game took 3.5 hours! At that length, the game felt very repetitive. But perhaps it would be much better if played at an appropriate speed?

It's a very tactical action selection game. The board shows 2 main areas:
- the world, divided into several regions (starting in eastern Europe, then spreading westwards and eventually to the "rest of the world"
- a tech track of ships: 11 ages, each with spaces for merchant and war ships
Each region of the world has several cities, each with 2-6 spaces for merchant cubes and 1-2 places for discs. Each player has a board with spaces to warehouse goods, and a bank to store coins. There are also several action spaces: choose an action by placing one of your cubes (you get 2-4 every turn) there. The actions allow you to build or upgrade ships (merchant or war), buy a card (variety of special powers, often combining 2 regular actions) from the display, sell goods for money, earn navigation tokens (used to advance on the tech track), etc. When you build a ship:
- place a ship in the appropriate box on the track (if you advance tech, earn VP; outdated ships cost their owners VP), and a cube or disc on an appropriate space on the board, earning a variety of immediate bonuses (resources, points, extra action cubes, navigation tokens, etc.). If you advance to next region, the previous region scores (every cube/disc is worth 2-7VP, depending on region's number; discs earn bonus 1VP per cube of same player in that city).

Players continue taking actions, gradually advancing from Era to Era (Galley -> Sail -> Steam). The game ends at the end of the round (even turns) in which there are 5+ boats in the last Age. Remaining resources/coins convert to VP; most VP wins.

The board changes A LOT between each of your turns, so it seems a bit difficult to make specific plans. Instead, you have to evaluate the board and decide on the best thing to do ... which slows things down since you have to wait till your own turn to decide! I think you can and should make some kind of broad plans, and you do have to plan towards the end of the game (the last few regions can earn a BOAT LOAD of points), but you still have to for the most part play tactically. I like tactical games, but less so when they take as long as this one did ... need to try it again.

RATING: N/A
A single play which is not enough in this game to conclude anything. I got the feeling though that the game compensates a strategy of NOT having ships on the board and NOT giving enough chances to players grow differently in terms of number of actions. Goods were not differentiated enough in this first approach but I'm sure this will change in future plays.

Very solid design with a very strong 'area occupation' mechanism that feels a bit like area majority because players tend to get more presence in each region before scoring. It's not area majority but feels a bit like.

Need to define very well the timings and this is something reachable with experience only.

After playing it a couple times more we all got the impression that it is much more tactical than strategical. The way the game flows with the opening of the new ages, on both ships and cities but mainly with cities, the definition of the winer may come from these events. And most probably the player opening the new ages has no control on anything, as it all depends on the number of turns one can get in the new era. I'm objectively referring to the last City era.
Also, the way city advancements and ships advancements work, with both being disconnected with each other, cools down the game a bit for me, because it stretches the game play artificially and I've experienced players forcing the ship age so that the game rushes towards its ending. Not a bad thing, probably, maybe a characteristic that one may or may not enjoy.

Normally I like many of martin's Wallace designs.  The game play during the beginning and middle of the game was a well thought out worker placement game.  The workers are represented by cubes because the board space is limited.  The concept of having to retrieve the limited number of workers back to the pool is brilliant.  However the end game in my opinion is seriously broken.  I played poorly through most of the game but stayed within 50 points of the leader who was zooming out ahead through thoughtful play.  But I was told that most of the points in the game came in the end area.  I played for that end area and dumped 6 cities and 13 workers into the final section and 70% of my VP's there and won the game.  It was a VERY dissatisfying win and will probably never play the game again because of the truly poor design of the end game.  It is like the optimal strategy of Ships is during the first 2.5 hours of the game is to see how little you can place on the board so you have all the stuff available to stuff in the last space as fast as possible.  Not my type of game.

RATING: 8
First impressions are quite favorable. This game is not as complex as we've been led to believe. The nautical theme effectively conveys the progress of civilization.

At least initially, Ships is a long game (3+ hours) but I didn't mind because it was engaging throughout.

The artwork is excellent, my only playability issue being that it can be tough to see separation of the ship ages on the track at a glace. 

There are a few unfortunate proofing errors (e.g., a wrong example in the rulebook and several of the card effects do not match what the rules state).

There are some very interesting decision trees presented, one being whether to push ships or push areas (both require navigation tokens, which are quite valuable). The timing of retrieving your cubes (either from your play mat or from one prior area) can be crucial. Judicious use of black cubes is really important, too.

What goods to take with your merchants is vital for forward planning as they have variable sell/exchange rates. For example, exchanged Oil can save you when you desperately need an extra action.

There's just the right amount of moving parts (free actions, cube management, merchant/city placement, goods, money, warehouse/bank space, cards, etc.) to keep you fully occupied. Actually, all things considered, the design is rather elegant.

Be prepared for an avalanche of VP's at the endgame (how well you plan for that endgame is very important) - this can lead to a dramatic (and disconcerting) snowball effect if ship technology has not kept pace with area advancement.

Another issue we've seen is that the 1st player can be at a disadvantage.

Has the obsolescence rule from Automobile, but warts and all Ships is the much better game. Indeed, I believe that this (thankfully) is Wallace's best design in years.

tl;dr: the Martin we know and love

Some people see this game as a return to form for Martin Wallace. But I don't agree, as he never really stopped making these kinds of games, it's just that we saw less of them for a bit. But he was always working on them.
I played the prototype for this game twice in February 2014 (so that's 2 years ago!) and liked it a lot. I don't remember exactly, but if I'm not mistaken the game that was published is really close to that version. The basics are certainly the same.
In any case this is one of his strategic euros that made me fall in love with his designs. Deep strategies with lots of choices and moving elements that make the game very challenging.
In our first 3 player game I was running away with the victory. I did have the feeling I still had to work hard to keep it that way, but each turn I was able to keep my lead. I'm not sure if that was due to my superior strategy (it probably was, you know me :whistle:) or the game that has a weird cadence to it with 3. Time will tell, but we all really liked the mechanisms and strategies. So very good, with an asterisk.

Ships seems to follow the recent (post-aFAoS) Martin Wallace trend of throwing tons into a game so that you can't quite work out how everything fits together, making it hard to break. But it also makes it a little muddy.

Ships is certainly an interesting game, though I'd like to try with fewer than four players next time.

Interestingly, I'm not sure how well the game scales as the end game (of dumping ships into the 'Rest of the world' area for tons of points) appears anecdotally to be very different at differing player counts.

It's a solid design that gives players a lot to think about, but I do have some concerns over the significance of turn order and the need for equally skilled players.

While the board reminded me quite a bit of Wallace's Automobile, I was relived to find out the game is less math-intensive, although perhaps only a tad less dry (yes, ironic for a game with this name). Wallace's trademark simple turn structure that nevertheless drives a deep game is once again on full display here. For me, the thin theme isn't the problem here. Ships is the consummate "two steps forward, one step back" design, where despite the advances in eras and technology, you do not build an infrastructure or get better at anything. You just keep doing the same things over and over and hope that you score more points than you lose (and you will almost inevitably lose points, as older ships get penalized as new era thresholds are passed). All in all, an interesting design that just didn't grab me and draw me in.

I'm conflicted with Ships. I really like half the game and don't care much at all for the other half. The half I like is the way the action selection works and the player boards function. But I don't like the way the board play develops. The "map" just feels really wonky. You travel in a strange direction, then you go abstract into a squares section. I just don't like it. Plus, from what I have read, it appears saving up all your assets for the final map area is a really solid strategy, which I don't like.

I'll likely trade it away or sell it soon.

Another good, thematic game from Mr. Wallace. Several mechanisms are familiar to those who have played Automobile. The merchant goods distribution in the locations seemed somewhat arbitrary, but further study may reveal the purpose. The game is enjoyable and moves along pretty well. A bit deeper and longer overall than Automobile, a game I prefer over this one.

This is one of the better games by Martin Wallace. It has 2.5 mechanisms that work together and provide a nice progression in this game (ship age progression, area progression, card progression (this is the half)). There are many options of how to approach the game. It keeps you engaged the whole time. It is fast if you know the rules. About 2 hours for 4 players (maybe 90 minutes if you know the rules well). The rules are actually simple. It is one of these games that a video explanation could have been so revealing of how relatively simple rules this game has. The decisions that you have to make on the other hand are staggering in complexity. Very interesting game. The theme works well also. For some bizarre reason gamers with AP problems will play this game relatively fast (maybe it is too complex to fully analyze, and thus they give up to make the effort to try to find an optimal move).

I'd been curious about Ships for a while, mainly on account of the designer Martin Wallace. I haven't really played many Martin Wallace games, but I've enjoyed most of the ones I have, and Brass is simply a brilliant game. So I was happy that someone I knew had a copy that I could try.

The game is deceptively straightforward. You get two action cubes a turn and there's a set of seven or so actions you can spend them on for your turn. There's also extra action cubes that you can get in the game and that start becoming available later in the game that you can stockpile and use at your discretion. The regular action cubes are pulled from your available supply, but require a special action to move from used to available. The extra action cubes are single use.

The actions are putting a ship out, upgrading a ship, removing a ship, taking a card, taking a gold, taking navigation tokens, or recalling your used cubes. Putting ships out is the heart of the game. Ships are either merchant ships or military ships. A merchant ship requires you commit a cube from your available supply to the board, which you likely will not get back for the rest of the game, but gives you goods you can sell for money and/or points. (Note: cubes are in short supply, so this is deceptively more costly than it initially appears). A military ship opens up space for you to store goods and money, and places a disc on the board which will give you some special bonus. Those cubes and discs will also score you points, depending on which phase of the game you're in.

Most of the rest of revolves on advancing the game through navigation... where you spend navigation tokens (or more often don't) and worrying about outdated ships. There are two different tracks that advance as the game goes along, areas and ages. Areas are related to the cubes and discs you put on the board. You can only place the discs and cubes from ships in the current "area" which is a series of cities (or countries later in the game). To advance into the next area you must spend however many navigation tokens it costs, less a discount for all the discs already in the current region. Then you score points for the closed region. Ages are related to ships. You can only place ships in the current age. To advance into the next age you must spend the appropriate number of navigation tokens, less a discount for every ship in the current age. The player who does this gets points, and ships from earlier ages cost players victory points. (You'll only ever lose 3 points per ship as they are destroyed once they become too old.) The remove a ship action simply takes a ship off the board and the upgrade a ship action allows you to place a ship by moving a ship from an older age to the next age from where it was.

Things I learned from the first play: Getting extra cubes is important. Making space in your bank not only isn't a good idea, doing it more than once or twice is a bad idea. Industry (which lets you double your merchant ship bonus) is important. Worrying about the 3 points you lose per ship probably isn't that big a deal. Having food at the end of the game is important (as the scoring for playing military ships at the end is huge).

It's hard for me to judge the game from my first play. We had three new players and I don't think the game played out how it usually would. I'm a little concerned that there doesn't seem to be multiple paths to victory, and that the game is going to be about everyone optimizing the exact same strategy and/or that it might devolve to dancing around when you open up the next area/age and who is lucky to get the best cards (that come up in each era and do powerful things). That's not necessarily a bad thing in every game, and maybe it's not even the concern here (I can't honestly say after this play), but it is my fear for the game.

Mechanically interesting. Theme doesn't come through very strongly. A bit more fiddly than I would prefer.

Feels like an Automobile and Brass mashup. Excellent game but feels like it is not quite in balance and the gameplay lacks streamlinedness. First player seems to be at a significant disadvantage when the game ends and at a very small advantage at the start. It would be okay if the point collection wasn't so end heavy but sadly it is extremely so. Also the gameplay bogs down, even experienced players have a hard time figuring out an entire turn without making mistakes and having to backtrack. When we started the game I was rating a 10, but this rating went down a lot during the game. Playtime was only slightly over 2,5 hours, which is not bad but it just felt a lot longer. In the end Ships is a good game but will never get even close to Brass or Automobile. And since I am not likely to play those enough to grow tired of them, Ships was likely just a pleasant one-time experience.

Excellent Martin Wallace game with timing tension and advanced planning decisions. Would love to play more.

I received an early copy of the game and enjoyed playing it. I do need to give it a couple more plays because this game is heavier than the rule book makes it out to be. Also, Navigation tokens are way more valuable than they seem! There is a lot to think about and several strategies that can be implemented for earning the most victory points either through war, trading, or moving forward in Ship Ages the fastest. It was definitely a brain burner and thematic, but took about three hours for three people to play. This will probably be a once or twice a year game for me for those willing to play rather than a regular played game such as Euphoria or Castles of Burgundy. :)

A good game from Wallace. Not quite Automobile, but better than Aeroplanes.

Wallaccceee!! Why do you do this. For years now you've given us this family friendly tosh, then this to remind us of how great you used to be. Martin is back to his best with this one. It's a race game, but what a race.

Heavyweight gamer's game.  Another MW winner along the lines of Automobile.

Game is enjoyable enough, but I think it comes down to who has procured the most cubes during the game.  The pacing on scoring is way off,with too many points in age 7.

A thoroughly mediocre game: fun enough, but the end-game seems to confuse or upset some players.  Thematically disconnected in a way that Automobiles wasn't--a touch too point-salady, really, and I'd probably sell it if there were any buyers out there, and Lucy didn't like it so much.

Maritime themed civ builder beginning in the Mediterranean. Plays more like an abstract strategy area control euro. Military action amounts to placing a area control disk. Ship upgrades through the ages is more of a point scoring or punishment avoiding exercise. I feel like I'm just moving cubes and disks around to score points, buy cards and get more storage space so that I can get even more actions to move and place cubes and score while advancing along the ship age track. Not my style of game so it doesn't resonate for me is all.

Wonderful game, solid, pretty and fun to play. I like the ages and the feel that you are opening the world as you go through the game.

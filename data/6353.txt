Uno de los primeros diseños de activación por zonas y agotamiento de las unidades.
El desarrollo de la campaña por parte aliada es muy estresante para tratar de cumplir los objetivos marcados en el avance hacia el Rin.
El jugador alemán puede impedir la victoria aliada la mayoría de las veces. Buen reflejo histórico.

RATING: 9
I've played the 17th through the 20th once as germans a week ago and then once as allies tonight.  Both times against Fatso.  The Germans seem to be easier to play as they enjoy the task of spoiling of the allies offensive, while on the other hand, maintaining allied aggressiveness is complex and essential to their chances of reaching even the half-way point.  So then in my opinion, the allies position is very challenging and fun for aggressive tactics, while the german position seems to be a deliciously subtle game of maximizing their position in a rapidly deteriorating front.  

I hope to play the longer versions in the near future, but I definitely want to get to know the first four days better before I go there.  I do fear the price I may be willing to pay someday for this game.  So I hope MMP reissues this game soon.

RATING: 8
Maybe more enjoyable as Breakout: Normandy, but not as revolutionary, since there are no changes at all. The BKN system leaves much room for improvement and innovation. I'm a bit disappointed that the designer didn't took that chance.

Why is the mapboard curved while the key cities of Eindhoven, Nijmegen and Arnhem are on a straight line? Where is Ravenstein, the fortress village situated next to Grave!? This is something the local Tourist Information won't like to learn. And then the river IJssel pronounced as Ijssel! Oh, my toes are hurting and haven't I warned Mike!!

further I miss the flanking corps (next to the XXX-corps), which could add a lot more spice to the game. The game does capture some of the flavour of MG and it's nice to see my hometown on the map. I find the XXX-corps / Airborne Divisions unit ratio too unbalanced and the airborne artillery is far too heavy, but an enjoyable game it is.

My first area impulse game.  Now I need to go back and try the others.  Beautiful map and counters.  I wish the map was a little more functional and a little less beautiful.  The first time you play it can be hard to tell the zones apart.  The Allies with XXX Corps have to race up the highways faster than the Germans can slow them down.  The rulebook is good, but the first time you play you will be checking it constantly, and some things are not immediately clear and intuitive.

Allies absolutely need to control the landing zones to assure a supply.  It appears that the primary task of the defenders is to blow bridges.  Much fun to be the Allies, and plays in 4 hours.  I'm looking forward to this one being reprinted.

RATING: 10
There is some quirkiness with the rules, even the not so new, but improved ones.  The designer's desire to slay all those who dare criticize this game is childish, and seems to be a trend with the latest batch of would-be-wargame-Monets.  Setting the designer's ego aside--with the help of a fork lift, mind you--this is an excellent game that invites many replays, while encouraging varied strategy & tactics.  I look forward to the reprint, sans ego.

Played the game and liked it. Need to download the latest rules on the multimenpublishing website because the rules included with the game are not always clear. Very good playing time of about 3.5 hours.
Some counters (e.g. the disrupt counters) are too big, they block the sight of the unit counters.
The units counters are VERY nice BTW. Just love to see the Sdkfz pictures. If you love Breakout Normandy, you should have this one also though BON is the better game.

RATING: 5
Rating changed after the designer and an MMP principle graciously removed their ratings. 

A good first effort by the designer with the usual very good MMP components. Worth picking up if you enjoy games that use the Breakout Normandy system.

The comments below are in reference to an earlier disagreement about rating games.   

I removed a unwarranted and mean spirited comment about the designer's mental abilities. Rated a 1 in order to call attention to the issue of a designer rating his own game. It is a conflict of interest for a designer to rate his own game especially with the expressed intent of negating the effect of some low ratings. Also, two MMP staff members rated the game. I am not accusing them of inflating the rating but it is another conflict of interest.

This game has 54 ratings. Three approximately 5% are from people associated with MMP. Those ratings are the 1st, 7th and 9th highest ratings for this game.

On its own I would rate the game a 5 - an average war game. 

The designer has stated that these ratings are joke but spends an inordinate amount of time and energy defending the game against a few very low ratings.

RATING: 9
I had a chance to play this again recently, and really got a kick out of it, enough to punch up my rating a point. It  might  even be better than the original, although I hesitate in saying that :) Due to the shorter time frame and larger area, the game is a little more tactical than Breakout: Normandy, and the game can be won or lost on minor tactical screw-ups (particularly around Arnhem) in a way that the previous game couldn't, really. You need to take particular care in understanding all the mechanics and implications of the D-Day airdrops.

Once this is done, though, this is a game with a lot of tension, a lot of interesting tactics, a constant challenge to maintain flexible in the face of circumstances, and a very sensible playing time (2-3hr) - a relief in this day of wargame designs were it seems like considering how much time it'll actually take to play is often not a significant factor. Tension should be retained right until the end of the game.

I enjoyed revisiting this title a lot and look forward to it hitting the table a few more times in the near future.

Very attractive package (price, components and map) with a very much improved second edition set of rules. The game plays well although one must learn restraint with the Germans. The British order of battle has some oddities and I feel the German artillery can be overvalued. The Courtney Allan impulse system contains a remarkable amount of history with remarkably little pain. 

Further playing makes me wonder as to the fun level for the Germans.

Update after 12+ plays

The best A/I game.  The ticking clock, the potent bag-of-tricks possessed by the operational defender, the bridge that always seems too far.  It all works in an evening.  I came late to the party, was lucky to get a copy, and it has risen to the top shelf of my collection.
__________________________________ 

Update after 6+ plays

Repeated play as both sides have raised my rating on this title.  I believe it may de-throne BK:N as my favorite A/I game.  The situation gives great tension as the Allies struggle to meet their goals and the Germans spoil and thwart.  There is much more replayability than one might imagine given Market Garden's nature.

-------------

I have played this title's 4 day scenario four times now and I can say that it breaths new life into the MG operation, courtesy of the A/I system.  The Allies *always* have more that they want to do then they can do, often much more, while the Germans pray for the sun to set or pass behind the clouds.  The tactical battles, the bridge destruction and capture attempts, the variable turn length ... all the A/I elements work well here.  Replayability is *much* higher than any Igo/Ugo take on MG I have ever played.  

Some may feel the game is better suited to solitaire play by the "Allied player" in a sense, that's Market Garden.  Yet the German player has much to do as they play a positional game, a waiting game, and often strike with devastating effect when the sky clouds.  Simply contesting areas can cost a VP or sever the vital XXX Corps supply line.  One of my favorite aspects of TP: Stalingrad: infiltration, returns to the Jerry's box of tricks.  

If you like BK:N and it's brethren, think seriously about giving this game a try.  It is worth the price for A/I fans as well as those open to A/I with an interest in the MG operation.

An excellent area impulse game, refining and improving on Breakout: Normandy.  The game is well balanced with each player having constantly to prioritise and reassess their actions.  Lots of interesting nuances.  The map and counters are beautifully depicted and the rules are clear and concise.  Most importantly the game is fun and exciting to play, easy to learn and can be played in 2 - 3 hours.  Would be a 10 but for the unmounted map and one or two counter issues.

I love the area - impulse system, and I was very interested in this one, but after repeted play, it seems to me that the game  repeats itself over and over. Actually you have just tactical decisions to make.Understand me. This is a very good game, aimed at the fans of area - impulse system and it's certainly better than the first 3 installament in the series. But BkN it's not.Play it and have fun. It takes 2-3 hours to play the short scenario.

The Courtney Allen impulse system from Storm over Arnhem, Thunder at Cassino, etc, makes it way into MMP.  I enjoy the AH games, but this one felt a bit lacking.  Really struggled with the rules out of the box, despite them being based very closely on Breakout: Normandy.  Seemed to be a ton of errata, which I didn't bother following up.  Half baked out of the box, and makes you appreciate the developers Avalon Hill had.  Almost worth owning for the cover!

The latest of the area games, and, so far, the best.  Unlike Breakout Normandy, both sides have plenty to do and, like Breakout Normandy, the game play gives a good narrative feel, with players associating with individual units so that they are no longer cardboard counters moving over a cardboard map, but named divisions making decisions about lines of advance based on terrain and named locations.  The game recreates the desperate struggle of the British paras to hold on to the Arnhem Bridge and Oosterbeck, while XXX Corps pushes up the road over a carpet of US paras to relieve them.  The game often turns on the weather, with Allied reinforcements being dependant on the dreaded fog, whilst the German player has plenty of decisions to make about counterattacking to slow XXX Corps, taking on the US paras to cut the line of advance or throwing their weight into the bloody streets of Arnhem.  The game plays well, is beautifully produced and gives a great deal of nail biting tension right to the end.

A worthy successor to Breakout: Normandy. Has a strong mix of tactical and strategic considerations for the players. I fact, I like it better than BK:N for the 3 hour playing mark. Makes bringing out the game a lot easier. Good tension throughout, which I think the structure of the Arnhem campaign helps a lot (the whole 'rescue the guys before they get wiped out' scenario does make for exciting play).

One of my favorites, I really like area movement wargames and wish so many weren't out of print.  This game looks and plays great, tho I wouldn't mind if  the rules were a little simpler.  I found the rules were fairly complex for a game of this length, with lots of elements and mechanics to keep track of.  Bridges, weather and other things add to the learning curve.  Of course I was also learning the area movement system for the first time.  After a couple plays it all seems easier and game is a blast!  Really a great game about one of my favorite battles of WWII.  I'm glad that Michael Rinella keeps making area movement games.  This game led me to buy Thunder at Cassino (which I love), Storm over Arnhem and Breakout: Normandy.  All are area movement games and share the same rules at heart- but the newer games in the series have more complex rules.  Along with block games, area movement games are my favorites.

First impressions are quite good. The game is very much like "Breakout: Normandy" which I like and used to play a lot. I am pondering whether the strategic situation in this game is as interesting as that in BKN, since both players' strategic choices seem pretty straightforward (although I admit it really is too early for me to say). However, the impulse system still leaves the players with lots of gut-wrenching little tactical decisions, which IMO is what makes the system so interesting.

The components are kept in the same style as BKN, with a slightly inferior map (eg., telling area boundaries from railroad lines often requires a close look) and nice 5/8" counters.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Overall a very good game which I would very strongly recommend.  It generates a real flavour of that desperate attempt by XXX Corps to drive along the airborne carpet to Arnhem.  It is exciting and tense with most games going down to the wire.  The area/impulse system works extremely well. The game is not however for pedants who desire an exact replication of the Order of Battle of both sides with what they consider to be the precise strengths of those units.  It is also quite asymmetrical in that, initially at least, the German player has a lot less to do, however that lends itself to solitaire play.

The first incarnation of the rules was a bit of a mess so it is essential to download the latest version.

RATING: 6.9
played a game, very tense as the Germans..lost but kicked the Red Devils big time! Really like the area movement system mechanic though it is a bit counter intuitive to the standard operational wargame mechanics. The fact that you either fight or move rather than fight or move to fight has cause me to make a few errors. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Badly hurt by the broad range of the die roll in the combat system, which can lead to rather surprising results such as a single flak tower (and its attendant troops) holding off a reinforced brigade on the attack more often than one would expect - unpredictability can end up ruling over any decision.  On the other hand, using the area system is definitely a good way to bring a little life to Market Garden, though the replay value suffers if you're more interested in trying different approaches than adapting to what the dice bring.  The Allied strategy is fairly scripted - you're mostly managing chaos here.

The growing trend of aerial movement in wargaming comes now to Market Garden operations.  A sign of simplfying wargmaing system not only in the simulation system and techniques, but also the overall presentation of wargaming in a softer approach.  This is a good sign to attract non-wargamers.  This game draws on the ealier experiences in Breakout Normandy game and can deliver the game objectives. Given the relatively new coming of the designer, I look forward to his similar design "Shifting Sands" on WW2 North Africa for new release.

Nice quick (4-5 hours) area impulse wargame. Plenty of interesting choices to make, but the games seem to turn out a little bit samey (It's rather scripted) The allies seem much harder to play, you can get badly screwed early on if you don't take Arnhem and Nijmegan, and hold them. But then again, from thinking about the history and map, it should be obvious that you have to do that.

I bought this game full of hope because  it seems that it aims for exactly the way that the campaign should be simulated - i.e quick enough and at a high enough level to replay if bad weather, unlucky bridge blowing rolls, etc. screw up the Allied efforts prematurely.

Unfortunately the rules made absolutely no attempt to make the game comprehensible to players without prior experience of Breakout Normandy and, as such I was never able to tell whether I was playing the game correctly.

The second edition rules are much easier to understand, although I have not yet had a chance to try them out.

RATING: 5
This doesn't get a higher rating because I find it less engaging than some of its sister games (Storm Over Arnhem, Turning Point: Stalingrad and Breakout: Normandy) - all of which I really like.

Of course that is not a criticism of MG:MG.  It is just that I find the level of tension in those relatives greater, so they will get higher ratings.  That might be the nature of the battle - strung out over a wide area in this game, and more concentrated in those others.

Like BKN, this is a fun wargame that can be played in an evening (always a bonus). The designer has certainly erred on the side of making it a game rather than a historical simulation, but that's fine.

Area system movement and combat for Operation Market Garden.  Once you get through the first turn(because of all the special rules) the game plays pretty smoothly.  It took me a few readings of the rulebook to grasp some of the concepts such as ending the turn, river crossing, bridge demolition, etc., and I'm glad to see I'm not alone from the other comments about the rules.  Still, a good game that's fun to play.

Another of the very few short, quality wargames on the market.  I've got about 5 sessions in now, and I really like this game.  It may be arguable that the overall strategy of each game may play out pretty much the same, but the unit tactics from game to game are certainly going to be different - and that will give one much to think about.  I'll have to take a closer look at other area movement games now that I've played this.

Worthy successor to BKN.  Playable campaign of only 10 turns.  Very tense, 4-turn (2 or 3 hours) basic game.  A handful of new wrinkles to the system that really work for Market Garden.  Joe Youst&#039;s map is gorgeous.  After just one playing you will appreciate the muted area boundaries.  This game is worth purchasing for the map alone.  Like BKN, very rich tactical variety between playings.  Designer Mike Rinella personally offers excellent support of his debut title on consimworld.com.  I knock 1 point off for rules that are ambiguous on a handful of points, and 1 because imho BKN is the king, and until dethroned others will get -1.  Area-Impulse seems odd at first if you&#039;re new to it.  Give it a chance.  You&#039;ll find it has thrilling impulse-by-impulse tension.

Easily, the weakest of the available Area-Impulse games. Too bad, because Breakout Normandy is one of my favorites.

A worthy addition to Avalon Hill's area movement system - second only to Breakout:Normandy.

I have played this a few times, and have not been impressed, despite Breakout Normandy, which uses the same system, being a favourite game of mine.  MGMG has fairly limited play options, badly drafted rules, lots of counter errors, and many of the unit ratings are ridiculous in historical terms.  The designer has misunderstood the British OOB, and includes units in the game which were not there in reality, or which did not operate in the way he imagines that they did.  (And what is the designer doing rating his own game here?  A 9.1, no less! Why not a 10?)

The Breakout Normandy system applied to Market Garden and it works well.  Gives a great overview of the battle with minimal play time.  Monty's Gamble and Breakout Normandy are the acme of the area impulse system, better than the games before or since.

I like this game and how it operates. Being a fan of Breakout:Normandy, I hoped this one would live up to it, and it has.  If you own and enjoy Breakout:Normandy, you should consider this game too.

RATING: 8
Uses the Breakout:Normandy system but is quicker to play. Be sure to get the version 1.1 rules. The only drawback is the lack of strategic options for the allies: there is only one place they want to go, and only one way to get there. This is, of course, historically accurate.

Area movement - Impulse game of Market Garden. Brigade / Battalion level. Beautiful map. Large counters.

RATING: 7.5
Nice attempt to make Market-Garden an area movement game based on the Break Out: Normandy/Turning Point: Stalingrad/Storm Over Arnhem type system.  The map is a bit flimsy but it will do.  Nijmegan is the key to German success: dump all your units here and watch Monty swallow hard each turn!

My 1st foray into the impulse system, so a bit strange to someone used to traditional hex games. That said, I enjoyed the learning games and am looking forward to getting a real game under my belt.

Fantastic simulation of the operation using the "Breakout Normandy" system.  Lots of good chrome.  Have errata counters from Operations Special Issue #1, and Fortress Holland 1940 counters and rules from  #2.

Fun 3-4 hour game on an interesting topic played on a visually appealing mapsheet using area-move/impulse rules based on BKN.  Rules as printed were marginally better than BKN rules, but with the revised rules on-line at MMP, rules are now a full step ahead. Important tactical decisions to make each Impulse, and lots of room for different strategies.  Anyone who thinks there is only one way to play this hasn’t explored in enough, IMO.

RATING: 7
With the rules as redrafted, the game plays as designed. I just don't find it a very good ludic experience in terms of maintaining the historical hook that I require. There are some areas where the designer betrays a lack of understanding of British military matters. By comparison to the other games in the series, I feel this game suffers in physical presentation (the mapsheet is of inferior durability) and in the scope of the battle portrayed using the system. Now that I've played the game a few more times, I've re-rated it based purely on the BGG rating. I still think that any designer who boasted of not having bothered to do any further research or reading between his original submission of the game and the resubmission to a different publisher is  fairly laughable, but the game itself is much more enjoyable purely as a game thhan Breakout Normandy. 

I've pared down my games collection lately and this is one I've kept purely  on its play merits. I'll have to pick up a second copy as the original components haven't lasted as well as I expect from a recent game release. Playing it PBeM via VASSAL or CB will be the preferred option for me from now on until such time as I obtain an archival copy.

RATING: 7
Area-impulse game of Operation Market-Garden, making it simpler and quicker than most games of this battle. I have always had difficulty in getting an Allied win in this game, even with the seven day scenario, which I thought was intentional given the result of the battle. Still, this makes it a good solitaire game as its easy to play the Germans (pinch the corridor and squeeze the First British Airborne at Arnhem) and you can concentrate on the Allies. There is also a scenario where the Allies can land their troops where they like within their divisional areas. There is not much to change for the Americans, but the British can try landing closer to Arnhem.

I'm told that aside from some quibbling over recon units, this makes for fairly good history. However, I found it a very entropic game, with the Germans unable to do very much at all except choose the key moment to act. So the Allies really get all of the fun.

My complaints are (were?) with the designer and not with the game.

Because of that I removed my low rating and changed it to a verbal comment to reflect this.

Alot of the issues I've had with him in the past have been resolved (his rude emails to me that were a misunderstanding at first, the shill rating of this game, the anti-shill rating of another game, his amazing ability to irritate others, etc.)

RATING: 4
I like area games, but here some important things are too luck dependent (FLAK-towers, bridge-blowing) and the overall strategical options are very limited reducing replayability value badly. Rules need some overhaul. And really, this is a rather boring experience for the german player because his options are quite limited and his chunk on downtime is too high.

I really do like this game.  The rules have been really streamlined which makes for a nice clean game system.  Questions of historical accuracy aside, this is a fun game!

RATING: N/A
You can set it up in 10 minutes. You can play it in two to three hours. It is hard on the Allies, but doable.

The best part is that each turn you think to yourself "I have to do A, but then he'll be able to do this so maybe I better do B, but then A will not get done!"

I do not think any other board wargame gives you the feel of Market Garden like MGMG. More tactical flavor, perhaps, more counters - certainly. But you can really sit back and watch the operation unfold, the Germans nipping at the flanks trying, desperately, to break the XXX corps supply line while the Allies try to get to Arnhem and relieve 1 Para. 

Since I am an owner of MMP I am biased, but having played wargames for 30 years I know good wargames and this is a good game.

Removed rating as this seems to offend some.

Perfect size for this battle.  You get the full feel for the MG Operation.  Area impulse is my favorite style game.
I like this game because its only 4 turns and although less critical decision making then BKN, it still keeps you on your toes.  The weather DR forces you to do things faster then you'd otherwise like to which can open up holes for the other side to exploit.  You always have more units then time which creates that "what to do first" dilema that I enjoy.

An good game based on the Breakout Normandy system.  The Allies have the most to do and victory for them is all about achieving their objectives.  The Germans merely need stop them.  The sides are much more asymmetric than Breakout Normandy, so the German play is more subtle with few counter attacks.

Yet another of the Area-Impulse family that now adorns my collection. :o)
I bought this on the strength of my growing interest in the Area-Impulse gaming genre. I've tried 3 separate times now to read through the rules and every time have failed miserably. I thought it was me but it appears I am not alone. I now realise the big show-stopper for me is how they are written in a way that assumes a good working knowledge of the rules and game mechanics for this game's predecessor - Breakout Normandy. 
Maybe I need to learn how to play that first?

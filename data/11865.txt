Although a beautiful game to look at, somewhat lacking in strategic play and seems more dependant on the luck of the draw.  My opinion on this may change as I memorize the suits and card play combinations.  Fun, once you get the hang of it.

RATING: 10
I love looking at my starting hand and what's on the table, and trying to figure out which combinations I should go for. As the game progresses, I like how I have to modify my plan, and sometimes hate draft to keep my opponent from getting a high scoring combination.

I love how, once you score, you need to figure out what the odds are of being able to improve your score before your opponent can score.

You do sometimes get dud hands and your opponent stomps all over, which can be frustrating. However, since it's not a single hand game, this bad luck tends to hit both players evenly over time.

It lets me play something Mahjong like, but for two.

Koi-koi is a Japanese "poetry-building" card game. What does that mean? Each card represents a scene from nature corresponding to seasonal flora and fauna in Japan. The point of the game is to find cards to build "poems" composed of these scenes. For example, the image shown corresponds to a poetic depiction of the joy of drinking sake in the moonlight. Maybe I'm over-thinking this a bit, but in any case the game is good fun and I play match after match with my father-in-law whenever we're together.

This game is truly Japanese in play and in the scoring sets -- poetic in nature and beautiful to look at.  I still haven't memorized the scoring sets, but it scales well downward to my level and those I play with.

Full review on BGG. Very fun and addictive 2 player game played with the beautiful Japanese Hanafuda cards. This game is extremely portable, thanks to the hard plastic case and tiny card size. I have the Nintendo "Napoleon" deck of Hanafuda cards. Very high quality.   

This is the one game in my collection where I simply can not separate art from game play. The art, card design, and game play create a beautiful combination. Would I rate it so highly if it had gaudy art? No. But based on my affinity for the game, this score is the minimum. 


I currently have:
1 Nintendo Napoleon deck (excellent quality)with black backs.
1 Nintendo "club Nintendo" Mario themed set with red backs, which I believe are of the same quality as Napoleon deck. 
1 Nintendo "Miyako no Hana" deck with red backs, which I believe is their least expensive set, but also very nice, just a bit thinner tiles/cards than Napoleon decks. 
1 cheap Korean brand deck with red backs. These are actually plastic. The prints aren't nearly as beautiful as the Nintendo ones, but these are great for playing in any conditions(plastic cards).

Although the Hanafuda cards look very unfamiliar in the beginning, the game is a lot of fun once the flower motives make sense. Play is simple and fast. There is a lot of luck involved but tactical decision have to been made, too. Like in Poker you can even calculate the chances of getting the required card and play accordingly.

Anything with immense meta-game culture is worth a 10.

For the game itself, I would rate it only 4. To memorize all the cards and score combinations is annoying. I am not sure what kind of game space will be after one is able to memorize everything, but luck still plays a huge role certainly.

I'm trying now on BGA.

Seems like its all luck but its about managing the luck in a partially known situation. knowing which set it which is rather helpful. Played hundreds of times on DS and Hanafuda APP.   yet to find a nice deck though

(Note that so far I have only played against an AI...)

Koi-koi is a relatively simple (though possibly complicated-looking), light card game played with the beautiful hanafuda card deck. Koi-koi is all about making sets. Cards for sets are obtained by matching cards in your hand and cards you draw with one of the cards on the table. Each set is worth different points, and multiple sets can be scored simultaneously. Only one player can score for a given hand, though, so the key is to ensure that you can make a set before your opponent. There is a twist, though: when you make a set you can choose to keep playing the hand. This is important because your score doubles above an certain threshold. Also you may think you can complete another valuable set. Conservative play will result in low scores, which can be quickly over-run with a good hand. The push-your-luck element is much of the fun of the game, but there are still plenty of strategic and tactical decisions to be made, such as decisions about which sets to attempt or when to take a card your opponent may want Instead of working toward your own sets.

When I first heard about koi-koi, it did not sound very interesting because it sounded very random. And indeed, when I was first learning it did feel very random (to the initiated koi-koi looks like total madness). I don't want to claim that koi-koi does not have a fair amount of randomness - because it does - but much of the randomness can be mitigated, and the randomness works well with the push-your-luck element of this game.

Overall, a fun light game that looks great thanks to the cards. It's just strategic enough to be interesting, but you can't take it too seriously, I think.

RATING: 10
Pleasant, relaxing, mildly luck-driven and endlessly replayable two-player game using the beautiful but initially confusing Hanafuda deck (in fact the game does become quite addictive when knowing the cards, more often than not tricky decisions come up that involve acute risk assessment). 

Players must capture the cards on the table laying first one card from their hand on the table and then one card from the pile - one card can capture another card belonging to the same month. When a player is able to build a pattern with cards just collected, they can go out or stay to beef the pattern up - if the rival builds a pattern of their own in the meantime, though, this new pattern will score double.

Gioco di carte semplice e immediato di origine giapponese. Esistono varianti per 3 e 4 giocatori ma il gioco nasce come 2-players. Determinante il peso della fortuna ma non manca un briciolo di strategia. Veloce e apprezzabile.

There are 12 'suits' representing the months of the year, each with 4 cards. Each suit has a characteristic flower, though sometimes they're a bit hard to match. There are no numbers, but some of the cards have special symbols: ribbons, animals and 5 extra-special cards called 'brights'. 

The game is a simple fishing game like Scopa. You start with 8 cards each and 8 face-up on the table. On your turn you play a card and if it matches a suit that's face-up you take both into your score pile. Then you flip the top card from the deck and attempt to match that too. Unmatched cards just add to the pool. 

The sets you're trying to collect to score points don't correspond to the suits, but to the symbols I mentioned. So for example, getting all 3 blue ribbons is worth 5 points, and 5 animals is worth a point plus one for each additional. It's difficult to work on multiple different sets so you have to focus on what you want to gather, and sometimes seed the pool hoping for a particular flip from the deck. 

But where the game really comes into its own is the push-your-luck element. As soon as you assemble a scoring set you can choose to end the hand right there and take the points. But you can also call 'koi koi' to continue and attempt to increase your score. The main reason to do that is that if you score 7 or more in a hand, it's all doubled. But the risk is that if you call koi-koi and then your opponent completes a set, he can end the hand for double points even if he doesn't have 7, and quadruple if he does!

It's got the fishing of Scopa, the set-collection of Mah-Jong and the delightful eccentricity of Cribbage.

Love Koi-Koi. Started to play on the Nintendo DS (Clubhouse Games/42 All-Time Classics/42 Spieleklassiker), but now I'm proud owner of two decks (Napoleon/President & Club Nintendo). Still looking for a cheap laminated deck for carefree playing in public :D. I'm also interested in finding people to play with :).

This has been a hit for everyday evenings and when traveling for my girlfriend and me. It takes a few games to learn the 12 suits and the different yaku. For us, the game is better with a handful of the variants to decrease the level of luck of the draw.

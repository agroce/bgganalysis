There's nothing radically new here; build a precarious structure, balance objects (eggs) carefully and hope you're not the one to cause a collapse.  Still, it works thematically, is as well produced as all HABA games are, and with a group of gamers it is cruel and amusing.

Kids games are grown up games too. I can't in good conscience give a game this light and simple anything higher than an 8, especially compared to other games with ratings that high, but this is an almost flawless game.

Played with my 5-year old daughter and it's kind of like a reverse Kerplunk! as you are building a nest (base) instead of destructing it. Pretty cool idea, but I think it needs more than 2 as otherwise it's 10 eggs per person and you are simply passing eggs back and forth to each other when something happens to the eggs currently on the nest. It also made it quite apparent that whoever got their last egg placed would easily be able to place the bird since almost all of the sticks were used at that point. Other than that a nice game, but not terribly exciting. I think there are a few other kids games I'd rather play and we'll see if my daughter asks for it again.

Dex stick game. Pull a stick and then pull another stick with the color on the far end until you have the same color on both sides or you have 3 sticks. If you get a stick with the same color on both sides you get to place 1 of your 4 eggs in the nest.

RATING: N/A
+ Simple (almost kid like) dexterity game
- Comparable with animals upon animal
- Original rule very luck based (can be changed to can place regardless of draw same color sticks or not)
- Competition with games like Suspend or Ice cool?

Ha, this is awesome. Hilarious to play, seems like a kid/dexterity game, but if you're not having fun playing this (and you can do it as it's a gamers game too) then you're probably just not a fun person.

We played without a (maybe?) key rule: if a stick falls out, your turn is over too. So we placed sticks in secure places, not realizing we could use them to grief other players, and the whole thing held up far too well. Not rating until I play properly.

Haba children's game where you draw out a stick that has colors on either end.  If you draw out a stick that does not not have matching colors you have to draw another stick with the same color as the stick that was down in the can.  If you can a matching stick or you draw three times, you need to place the sticks on the can and intermixed with other sticks.  And then you can place one of you eggs.  If an egg falls into the can, you need to take an egg from another player with the most eggs.  If you drop a stick at any time, your turn ends and you cannot place an egg.  

The game is really light dexterity game.  It is fun, and the sticks to start to look like a next.  But like many dexterity games, the replayability does appear to be there.

HABA has a knack for children's dexterity games. Not as good as Animal Upon Animal, in that it does have a moderate luck component. This one will turn some heads at the table.

RATING: 5
Cool idea and nice components, but I'm not a huge fan of dexterity games like this one. Actually, I'm not sure it's that good a family game at all, as most kids probably won't enjoy it. It's pretty harsh if you mess up & in your turn, if you're unlucky, you can even end up without having the chance to place an egg.

LOVED THIS GAME! Simple Haba dexterity game! It is clever and adorable. try to get rid of your eggs without dropping them in the tin. You are all forming to build a nest, but you want to be the first to place the bird after having your eggs all collect in the nest. It is adorable and I can't wait to own this one. I think my mom will love it. :) Might have been the top game of the month if Yokohama wasn't there. Serious love for this one.

Another Haba demo: a hybrid of Pick-Up-Sticks, Tumblin’ Monkeys and Gulo Gulo; it was passable, but I passed on the chance to acquire it. Getting favourable reviews now, so maybe I'd look at it again.

I was never a fan of Kerplunk as a kid, but I really enjoy this dexterity game. It's simple, yet you have to think about balance on three different levels: pulling out aticks, laying down sticks, and finding nesting spots for your eggs. The trick is, you don't want any of your stuff to be too stable, because you want it all to come crashing down on your opponent's turn. Great components. Worth the price!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A very accessible and very fun dexterity game. You can teach it in 2 minutes. Players enjoy the satisfaction of building the nest up, and they enjoy the tension. Easy 15 minute filler game.
Colorblind players may have trouble distinguishing red and green sticks, but other players can help identify the colors without impacting the game. Pick it up!

RATING: 9
You'd think this is a cute little kids game - but you'd be wrong. When playing with gamers, this becomes a cutthroat burn-your-neighbor game. I learned that cuckoo birds are the jerks of the bird world, leaving their eggs in other birds nests so that the other bird gets to raise their kids - this game oddly mimics that behavior (although the rules don't state it as such) - this game encourages you to be a jerk, and to delight in it.

1 play, 2er

Mediocre dexterity game. Sticks have one of 3(?) colors on either end. Players each start with a bunch of eggs. The sticks are randomly dropped/mixed in the canister (you can only see the upper end of each stick). On your turn, you'll be drawing one or more sticks out, then placing them horizontally across the top of the can. Then, place an egg. If you drop one of more eggs, you add them to your pool. The first player to get rid of all their eggs wins. 

It just wasn't very fun!

Pick-up sticks meets KerPlunk -- sort of. Don't overthink this one, just enjoy it. There is a cleverness in building a precarious nest that comes with experience. And the fact that I can even discuss "experience" as an advantage here is a testament to how well thought-out it really is. My only complaint is that I have a hard time believing that the recommended age-range is correct. 4+ seems too young. I'd give it another year or two.

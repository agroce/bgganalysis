This game was unknown to me until it was offered to play - so no preconceived notions (a real treat)! I enjoyed it very much. It fits in that unusual space of a portable that's quite strategic. Well produced for the most part (the board was a bit too shiny), it's a tight, mean majority control game - with a bit of dice going on that simply restricts your options. Well designed! I like it quite a bit.

For a small company that has such fantastic production quality is really amazing. The components are so well done, that it puts some 'bigger' game production companies to shame.

Gameplay is very straight forward and the rules are very well written and complete. (except a small error in one of their examples)

I must agree the dice rolls do play a major part in causing your strategy to collapse but the placement of a token on the boats do reduce this randomness. (minimally)

Overall, a quick and fun game that is playable by all types of gamers.

Fantastic as a dice-based filler with a bit more strategy to it than other games that take the same amount of time. i ended up buying this because I saw a negative review that said it wasn't deep enough... it it ended up filling EXACTLY the niche I wanted it to fill. Seen a few reviews compare it to Condottiere.

Cambria deserves a lot more attention here on BGG as an excellent (and quite portable) filler, something along the lines of Coloretto which is also an excellent (quite portable) filler. After one play, I give Cambria a provisional 8. Check it out.

This is a good little game. Took exactly 30 minutes, with instruction. Light, but with some thinking involved. The dice mechanic actually gives you some good choices to make. Rolling a 1 and placing a guy on a boat enables you to mitigate bad rolls in the future. The end sneaks up on you, so you have to stay alert, because you really need to position yourself for the end scoring.

A dice rolling game siege themed game with a tactical "from the sea" element and a settlers-robberesqe aspect. Entertaining filler that's a bit more than just a card game type filler.

Initially we thought that it finished too soon, but if it goes on much longer, then it descends into a simple dice rolling contest.

Apparently we played the empty forts wrong as we disallowed using those empty locations as legal placements for numbers rolled.  It is a simple game with enough depth, but quick enough play to feel satisfied.  I wish the Cumbria map was bigger as it was too difficult to see open roads.

Provisional rating of 6. I like the puzzle aspect where you try to best use the roll you get. But after one play, lucky rolls seem to decide who wins. I definitely want to play it again, and I foresee it might rise in my opinion as I get better at using the rolls I get. Putting guys on the ship is probably smart, even if you only do it once or twice in the game...a single roll defined by you could mean the difference between 6 point and zero.

Cambria is very good, light, quick filler that has both tactical and strategic options to it, which is surprising for such a short game. You need to balance the tactical aspects of getting points in the early and mid game with the timing of pulling your pieces out of immediate scoring position to maximize your potential to score at the end game. I highly recommend this as an option for a quick game that takes a little more thought than just your normal filler.

A quick area control game that works well with 3 players. Cubes are placed and replaced with plenty of strategy to be found and a mitigation of any luck of the roll. There aren't many good 3 player abstracts, but this one fits the bill.

Lovely, lovely, lovely little game of area control with influence placed on the boundaries (roads) instead of within the nodes.

The game takes all of five minutes to teach and fifteen to play.  Just be sure to warn new players about the great number of points awarded at the end.  Remind them again when there are 9 forts left.

The use of dice is clever, giving a perfect mix of chance and choice.  The ships allow a little planning.  A near perfect game.

Cambria is a nice abstract area control game, for 2-5 players, with a theme of Celtic tribes besieging Roman fortresses in ancient Wales.

It plays quickly, using dice but offering a certain amount of strategic use of these dice. The basic turn involves rolling 2 6-sided dice, choosing one of these numbers and placing a tribe token on a road to a fortress matching the number.

Captured fortresses bring VP, and the game ends when the Roman position is weakened enough for Cambria to fall (6 or fewer fortresses remain).

This is a great little game, with a good balance of luck and tactics to claim VP.

I love the Celtic/Roman theme, but the game is a really good one in it's own right. Starting this at a 7 based on first solo play.

A simple, dice-driven majority game, but unlike card-driven equivalents, there is no 'probability curve' to exploit in deciding on a good play. You can 'cover the numbers' to some extent and the ship mechanism allows for a bit of number substitution (so long as you've previously rolled such that you can move the legion). Fundamentally though, you're at the mercy of the dice.

This packs quite a good game into a very short period of time.

It's mostly area majority with limited placement options each turn.  And yet, it's seldom that one of those limited options will be blatantly optimal so there's plenty of room for skill.

Additionally the components are spot on and there's even a couple maps to try!  The 2-player works well too.

Cambria has a lot of randomness but I don’t care as the play time is too short. It can be a fun game and it has some resemblance to Samurai. It is a good filler, easy to teach and quick to play.

It has some interesting decisions so I will play Cambria again.

In an effort to better accommodate my rankings to the BGG ranking system, I need to downgrade Cambria Rating to a 5.0.

Cambria is a game I will play again, but it is not one I will request or buy. I don’t like games with a lot of randomness and the theme is paper thin. I will play it sporadically if I´m in the mood.

12/07/11 Second edition received. 
01/28/12 The rules are poorly written (that includes the game aid verbiage on the board). The designer blames this on the copy editor at Closet Nerd Games for muddling his first edition rules into the current second edition mess. How to play the game only became clear to me after I downloaded the first edition rules, read all the Q&A's here, and printed off the Cambria Roll Guide made by a fan from the Files section. All this requires me to take a point off my rating of the game. Its a pity for the game itself is a fine little 20-25 minute filler. If I was evaluating it alone I'd rate it higher. But considering the whole package (the crappy rules) knocks it down a step.  
02/14/12 Certain roads on the Cumbria side of the board are so short and crowded that its hard to place the Roman legion without there being a question of exactly which road its on. 
04/16/13 Used the Caledonia map. This variant from the publisher's website is nice since its free. But it has even more problems with short roads than Cumbria.

As of 10/18/17 I've played 24 games (winning 6), with 3, 4 or 5 players. Only four of which used the Cumbria side of the board. I've used the Caledonia map thrice so far.

Moderately compelling.

You roll two dice. Those dice correlate with two cities and you can place one of your cubes on an adjacent road to that city. Rolling a one allows you to move the Romans and kick off other players from roads.

In short, you try to win cities by putting more of your cubes around a city than other people and win the city. Person with most points wins.

RATING: 5.5
A cool little game, reminiscent of "Samurai," another game I own. Whereas in "Samurai," scoring comes off controlling places on a map, with "Cambria," scoring comes by controlling roads on a map. Initially, I had a few questions about some rules points that come up without being previously addressed. The rules are badly written: I read the designer mentioned a copy editor being involved, but that editor could not have been a professional, as even a cursory proofreading of the rules would have revealed glaring inconsistencies in word usage and spelling that confuses the rules. I had to resort to BGG Q&A and then totally rewrite them to make them comprehensible. After a few plays, however, I found I could play the game in about 20 minutes. Fills a nice niche in that there's a decent amount of strategy and one has to think out moves, but it plays quickly and doesn't take time to resolve. The designer seems very dedicated to his game, as evidenced by his taking the time on BGG to address rules questions. Given that the game is more abstract than theme-centered, I found that with repeated plays my interest started to wane, but it's something I'd still pick up and play on occasion. Purchased new, February 2012.

RATING: 5
A standard multi-player abstract with a tacked on theme. Forts are smattered across the board with roads between them, with values ranging between 2 and 6, and the number of roads into each fort is equal to its VPs. A turn is to roll two dice and then place a cube onto a road linking to a fort with the value of 1 of the 2 dice. When all roads into a fort are filled, if anyone has a majority, they win the fort and its VPs. The big forts will also give second place if someone has a clear second. The twist is that when a 1 is rolled, you can move the mother pawn onto a road linking to one of the second die's forts, eliminating another player's cube and stopping that fort from being resolved until the mother pawn is moved again. Similarly, if you roll a double you can exchange another player's cube with one of your own. The game is quickish, as you'd hope for an abstract with this much luck. You need to be observant - the obvious play may not always be the best one as you may want to tie up a fort that you're not really going for to stop others scoring. Getting the right die roll at the right times can be crucial. The game probably comes downs to who gets whacked when, or who gets competed with to stop them from scoring - that's a fairly significant king-making aspect which can be irritating. Ultimately, the king-making choices people make is the only thing that's interesting though.

Pretty good area control game, with some interesting decisions. The use of dice makes it a bit easier to play since it limits your options of where you can place your pieces, but it also means that your strategy is limited.

July 2013 - Initial rating after 2 plays.
Played 2 player variant only.  The dummy player won both games ! 

You are in the region of Cambria during the Roman Empire.  Each player represents a different tribe who are working together to cut off Roman forts and causing them to surrender.  Each turn, players roll two dice and pick one.  The number rolled determines the fort being attacked and an army is placed on one of the roads to the fort.  When all roads are blocked, you capture it.  Points are earned for the player with the most roads blocking.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The game works smoothly, but your actions are mostly controlled by the dice, and the interactive elements are mostly the result of a bad roll.  I think the key to winning is not not roll any 1's and to not get picked on by other players when they do roll 1's.  Rolling a 1 is dangerously close to a "let's you and me lose" proposition.  The ship mechanic should mitigate luck, but it's just worse than rolling what you needed in the first place -- it allows two bad turns to become one good turn.

Better with fewer players.  With 2, it might be quite good.  With 3 it is ok...maybe a 6/10.  With 4-5, it's low control and high luck.

It is also quite fast.  If there were a bit more going on, I think I'd like it a lot.

Nice, clean, tight, end of the evening wind down.

Player maps a die choice to a labeled network in order to surround and capture nodes, both individually (cheaper) and cooperatively (better and shared payouts).

Mechanisms for blocking capture and storing preferred rolls provide competitive twists, but space, playtime and chance keep it light.

Ending conditions can create a cascade of captures that may create an unhappy surprise, if you're not careful.

RATING: 6
A good recipe for a filler is to provide few options per turn, which limits analysis paralysis (e.g., one common choice is more or less "keep going/bidding or withdraw"). The trouble is making those decisions feel meaningful.

Cambria succeeds at this admirably: you roll two dice, which dictate where you can play. Rolling a one encourages you to move the special Legion piece, which also allows you to mitigate the luck factor by reserving a cube for later placement if the dice don't go your way. The core of the game is the tension between positioning cubes for end-game scoring and positioning them for early scoring, which also runs out the game timer.

It [i]is[/i] possible to be screwed by the dice, but that's perfectly forgivable in a 20 minute game, and without pathological rolls you do get (or think you get) meaningful decisions.

Roll dice, place a guy, try to completely surround point-forts and have a majority. Notice that people won't help you for a fort you're winning. Don't critically depend on dice rolls. SCore, with some second-place scoring.

A good filler. It really plays fast (a full game is usually under 20 minutes) and it is enjoyable.

It has a theme, sure, but is almost like a abastract. In no way you sense you are in a battle against the roman army and conquering fortress.

Sure, there is some amount luck - though the fact that two dices are rolled and you can choose between them, and that it is possible to save numbers (by rolling 1; or, if you prefer, theme, by putting some troops in reserve, by the boats) for later use, dimish the impact of the luck rolls.

A good game for what it's proposed to be. Not great, but a solid entry for the filler slot.

One fast game and learning the rules as playing, so not much to comment here. Simple and fast filler with board, not bad. Need to try another time again to understand the game potential.

Ok little filler but a litte dice dependent. But it's short enough that I would play again

It's basically dice-driven Kahuna, with poorly presented rules. (The font is way too small.) I like Cambria but it needed more polish, and a bigger board. 

Absolutely print out the FAQ and play aid before playing.

Excellent abstract filler.  Two-sided board.  Nice wood components for such a small package.

What a brilliant filler!
I was looking for something other than the usual trick-taking filler to finish off a gaming evening, and this is it. Fast, fun, tactical and cut-throat. 
And it's over in 20 minutes!

Received for translating the rules into Russian. Great game! Played 4 games in the very first day. Even though luck-factor is heavy, 2 dice give a lot of area for thinking. The rule of ending the game also provides for some strategic placement.
The game is a hit with us.

Fills a narrow niche - quick, simple, area control game.

After 1 play: Seems interesting, but it was so unintuitive it was hard to grasp on the first play.  I'd definitely like another shot at it.

Приличная абстрактная игра, которая совершенно не цепляет ничем.

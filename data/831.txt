This is an enjoyable light game, and (of course) the voting mechanism/contraption is amazing. I think playing to 50 points instead of 70 gives you an enjoyable experience that does not overstay its welcome. Play for the ride, and don't be bummed if you haven't much of a chance.

The CD is really nice and the game works fine. Betting right is what will make the difference between winning or not. Rating is a little lower than mechanics deserve because I dislike the graphics (not the theme) and game time is a little bit too long.

It's pretty fun to play on BSW.  I can see how this game can get tedious when played in real life.  There are possibilities of gangups, which is not so kewl.  However, this game is really lite...just place and know how group-thought works.

Fun mechanic.  Surprisingly racist imagery for 1999.  Very chaotic.  I think the physical attributes make the game itself bearable, but I also feel like it more than wears out its welcome in terms of playing time.  I can't imagine why I wouldn't play "King Me" to scratch this itch instead.  I'm sure it's much quicker on BSW but then you lose the records.

Tenative rating based upon one play.  One of the most unique mechanisms that I've seen, outstanding bits.  I think that this one is going to throw people for a loop trying to understand the strategy.  The strategy is to be able to out predict your opponents.  Similar to Lifeboat.  I think that overly analytical players will be looking for a game mechanic or strategy to give them an edge, and this will be a frustrating/random game for them.

This may be a little too tactical for me, but the outstanding components make it a winner.  Makes a great party game and can play up to 6.  Because of some of the band names, I'd say that this is definitely not for Middle school or younger.

Need to play this again.  I thought it was fun.

Played again with three.  There is some ability to manipulate the charts but it's a game of guesswork of what others will do.  Because of the theme, I enjoy it and give it a boost in my rating.  The voting gimmik is fun.

Update: played with six.  Fun, I see how you work the charts to get you bands up there.  Some skill in that but with six you are at the mercy of what others do and how the bands come out (even though all the bands hit the charts during the game).

Lots of voting (which is mostly guessing)... and lots of leader-bashing.  The vote collection device is a cute gimmick, but the game is fairly random.

Random, chaotic and not much control. Cool bits though, which gets it an extra point.

I'm not a fan of many blind bidding games, and this is one that is a bit meh for me - it definitely takes too long, if it was a 25 minute filler I'd like it rather more.

A party in a box!  There's not a lot of control over your fate, but enough that the player who can tap into the thoughts of the rest of the group will do well. I honestly think the people who rated this game low played only one time.  There's a subtlety here like the one in TransAmerica that allows the same people to win over and over to the bafflement of others. In some ways this game is similar to Rette Sich Wer Kann (Lifeboats).    Oh and the gadget is SUPER FREAKIN' COOL!

The "record" gadget is kind of neat, but prone to screwing things up if you aren't *really* careful with it (and you don't always notice when it does).

The game's semi-fun for a while, but it drags on WAY too long for the chaotic blind-bid fest that it is. The fact that you can easily lose points, thus extending the misery, just makes it more excrutiating.

This is a wonderful family game, provided your family doesn't have a problem with a few of the band names. It's definitely a game with a gimick: the CD player.

RATING: 4
(Played on BSW) This game is the definition of pure chaos. Players try to move bands of their color up the charts, while guessing which band will be the most popular, the least popular and which band will be #1. All movement is accomplished via combined player choice. Intersting for a bit, until the complete lack of control thumps you over the head like a sledge.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
An enjoyable game; perhaps not to everyone's tastes due to a significantly random nature.  I suspect it would become more controlled with fewer than the full six players (3-4 perhaps, but I haven't tried this).

UPDATE 01MAR06:  This game has been upped one point in my rating to an eight because I played for the first time in years (three years I think) last night and we had a scream.  It's light, family fare and a lot of fun; I'm not even sure I want to spoil it with some strategic variant anymore.

This is a fun, light bidding game where you try to predict/determine which recording artists will make the top ten.  The bidding mechanism/contraption is very clever, and it's a good game for 6 players.

RATING: 5
At first impression I thought this game would be around an 8 for me. I like games about market manipulation and this one has an unusual theme and a very unique mechanic. During play two problems emerged which seriously cut its rating for me. 

First, the game is billed as for up to 6 players. In fact this is a game for EXACTLY 6 players. Our 5 player game saw a large proportion of the unused labels bands hitting the board and one of the players labels almost unrepresented for the first half of the game. He changed labels at that time and the residual of his new labels bands did well. However at this point his new label received many fewer new bands than did his old label. This problem could be fixed by removing all bands for the unused label. This "repair" would require that all labels be equally distributed in the deck and that shared bands be evenly distributed. A relatively minor problem which should have been foreseen. -1 to rating.

The second problem was an error occurring in one of the last rounds of the game. The lowest ranking band was a band that only my label had signed. As one label was very underrepresented its player was actively trying to push other label's bands of the list so his bands could enter. Figuring that he would place a negative on my band I placed a +4 on my band. When the turn resolved my +4 was not generated for the turn. This is a serious problem. The very mechanic which made the game interesting did not work. The only fix I can see would be for each player to place their own folio on the spindle so that they could raise the cover and confirm that all tokens are in place before the folio is removed. This would be cumbersome. -2 to rating.

 8 Initial impression
-1 No provision for differing numbers of players

Game has a mechanism that results in completely anonymous voting! Without using any electronics! It's really neat which makes this game a must-play-at-least-once!! 

Seems best with either 5 or 6. With 5 you have a lot of votes coming in still, but the option to switch what color you're playing by paying 2 points if your color is doing poorly.

The game itself is a bit chaotic, but takes longer than I would like. Still absolutely marvelous to show new players.

Game mechanic is interesting, but the game itself is just chaos without storyline. A trained monkey could make the relevant decisions needed in the game. The bits are not half bad, but even they get boring after a while. I could see this as a party game and just 'fun', but the 'humour' that the makers attempted in the game didn't get me either. I actually have started wondering, what a interesting mechanic is utterly wasted in that excuse of a game. A way to improve upon the game might be to allow some investment into and resulting development of the bands, and to allow more control over their ratings in a way that is not up to the other players.

What a fun, fun game!  The production value allow earns this at least a 7.5.   The game has a mechanism like a dice tower, except it is a CD that you put your bits into and turn to release numbers on little disks.   The game is all about predicting which artist will top the charts. (Will it be the group Soft Exit or the artists know as Mambo).  Put your disks in the CD, put your CD on the "player", everyone does the same, and see what numbers pop out.

Its fun and totally a good time was had by all.   Add beer and you got a REALLY good time.

I wish they had built a deeper game around it.

Beautiful components with an interesting method for distributing "votes" representing movement of bands up and down a chart.  Some of the names of the bands are pretty hilarious and a couple are a tad racy.  Basically, each player picks out a music label and different bands can be supported by different labels.  You choose 7 random influence discs from a bag, select 5 of them to play which can move a band up or down the chart, and place two personal chips representing what band you think will be #1 and which band will move up the ladder the most for potential bonus or negative points.  I found it very enjoyable and unique to play even if it may be arguably a bit on the chaotic side but there is definite strategy to the game.

Mediocre simultaneous action selection game.  Could have been a cute filler game but it's just too long and a bit too repetitive for that.  Could be a good children's game if shortened but the choice of band names etc. makes that a little problematic.

The 90 minutes in the box side sounded scary, but fortunately the game lasted only for 45 minutes. There's little control - but some, it's not just guessing - but it's fun. It's very repetitive, though, and best with fast players who don't take too long with their turns. 90 minutes of this would be at least 45 minutes too much.

It has one of the most innovative scoring mechanisms. It's very enjoyable to see the charts as they are being altered by the "votes" of the players.

Fun!! Great music theme game with crazy wooden CD-player. Analizing group thinking and see the voting result is quite amusing. Always very close game. Tried with 3 and 5 so far. Probably better with 4 or more players. I want to try with 4 or 6.

Incredibly random but a great deal of fun - it's always exciting when that bottom feeder group climbs to the top or the current #1 act drops off the bottom of the charts.

Insanely crazy awesome game! I have only played it on BSW, but I think this game is awesome. A lot of luck involved, but a lot of bluffing and strategy involved too. I do not know why I love this game, and yet I still do.

Lowered from 8.5 to 7 on November 18th, 2006. Still a great game, but it could be better.

Raised from 7 to 8 on December 6th, 2006.

Lowered from 8 to 7 on Febuary 6th, 2007. It can take a bit long for what it is.

Raised from 7 to 8 on November 15th, 2007. Great game, one of the best party games ever. There's no strategy, but there is, but there isn't, but there is..it's great.

Game itself has potentially lots of chaotic elements. All voting is totally hidden from players so you can only guess what kind of progression there is going to be on the chart. Still it is a very neat game and fun to play. There is a lot of outguessing for sure and I like that as a mechanic. In Schrille Stille there is extra coolness/gimmick factor that comes from "cd-player" mechanic that allows players to cast votes simultaneously without others knowing what/where they have played. Nothing too deep but a fun game for 4-6 players. 

With 4 players there is usually no point to change your initial label because non-player owned labels don't seem to get any points at all. This can lead into situation where you only have 1 or 2 bands of your label because of top-3 retiring. This is painful if it happens but Schrille Stille isn't that serious game it would matter too much. It's great fun just to see how weird movements there is on the chart and what other players think will be the highest climber and number one for the week.

It's not too dissimilar to a really long version of Formula Motor Racing. Keep progressing your dudes as best you can up the spots, whilst sending other dudes back. It has some features that allow it to be acceptable in the longer length - cards can be multi-player so de facto alliances come into play allowing you to better predict where the investments will be, plus the point allocation device is very cool. It gives it another rating on top of what would usually be a 5. There's not enough there for any but the very occasional play.

This was a truly unique gaming experience. 

Completely different mechanic than I've ever seen.  Voting CD/Wheels where you pick 5 out of 7 drawn valued markers and also for #1 band and most improved.

I sucked at it absolutely and completely, but it was totally engaging and interesting.

4 player game. Jennifer's copy.  We only played to 30 (vs. 90).

There REALLY is a some control in this game.  It's so much fun watching people crash and burn in their selections as the votes are revealed.  The scoring is a bit fiddily and mistakes are easy to make.  The scoring also needs to be extended down a place or two in the top spots to speed the game up just a bit (ie it's a little too long).  This is definitely a 'more the merrier' game.

I like blind bidding games -- I enjoy Justinian, which uses the reorder rankings via hidden bidding mechanic. However, there is not enough information available during the game to judge how your opponents will react.

The device to collect the votes is innovative, but fiddly to use in practice.

Schrille Stille is a unique game, and for that alone deserves discovery. Very well-thought-of game mechanic combines with a delightfully original theme which will appeal to many age groups (even mixed). Vote tallies are very hard to predict, bordering on chaotic, but not quite. There's a bit of tactics one may learn after a few plays have gone by.Components are wonderful, perfectly in keeping with Zoch's tradition of quality; I know I'll have a blast if I'm simply allowed to operate the "tally system" during the game. Problem is, everyone else also wants to!

While this isn't a game that I want to play every day, I always enjoy it when it hits the table.  It always amazes me how a few people are so adept at picking winners, which leads me to believe there is less luck than one would think in this game.  In fact, each time I play this, it gets better and better (maybe as the games move quicker)

Gameplay gets about a six (there doesn't seem to be much control), but the theme, gadget, and especially kinetic movement of the bands make it quite a lot of fun.  I have mixed feelings about the art:  the outre humor DOES give it character, but the mild racism (and the Alzheimer's joke!) are a little off-putting to my sensitive sensibilities.

There is a huge amount of chaos in this game (chits you draw, chits others draw, chits others play, etc.) but it's a lot of fun trying to manipulate the German pop charts. And who wouldn't love a game with a singer named Titty Tarantella? EDIT: However, after playing with some who play a lot of games, there is a lot less chaos as people see how to manipulate the charts. We regularly had 3 to 5 players in a 5 player game all choose the same picks of the week of #1. Great game!

tl;dr: enjoyable for once

This game has some cool components: round things with holes in them in which you place round wooden disks that influence the hit parade. Those are wrapped in a holder the players 'disks' stacked on top of each other on a 'turntable'. Then the wrappers are removed so all disks of all players for a certain position on the hit parade are dumped together so no one can see who did what. The turntable is turned so all disks come out one hit parade position at a time. Of course you get points if your own tunes score well and you lose points if your tunes don't score well. It's all very chaotic as one would expect, but I kind of enjoyed it. I don't need to ever play this again though.

Initial rating: 6.5/10
BGG scale: 5/10

I just played this for the first time in real life not on BSW, and I am impressed.  It's a fun game, with a clever mechanism.  

It can be a little bit chaotic, but if you know who you're playing with, and what they might do, then it can be guessed what they may do some time.  The random chit pull on what influence you can have in a round is really the only thing random about the game, and if you take it lightly like it should be, then who cares about that.

A very solid game with a cool, gimmicky device added into the mix ... what's not to like? Players may not have a whole lot of control over their own fate in this one, but the decisions are interesting nevertheless, the game moves quickly and it's fun.

There's no arguing that the CD player in Schrille Stille is pure genious.  The game built around it is plenty entertaining, too.  A careful application of black permanent marker will soften the raciest of the German cards.  (How about "ITTY TARANTULA" instead of the original?)

A game that is worth having just for the super-cool CD player gadget that is used to tally the increases and decreases in the chart. With less players is more tactical, but also less fun. In the end, I don't regret buying it, but I think that maybe is not that really good of a game.

A neat voting system combined with some really unique components made Schrille Stille a very enjoyable experience at first.  Unfortunately, due to how easily you can screw the leader the game seem to take a long time to play up to the full 70 points.  The decision making in here is difficult not because there is much strategy to it, but rather due to the seemingly random assignment of points by the other people.  For me this will be long remembered for its interesting bits, not so much for the gameplay.

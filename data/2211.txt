Decent chess variant.  The variability of the dice-chess pieces guarantees a lot more mayhem than a standard chess game.  Nice light abstract game.

I've only played once and may adjust this rating after a few more plays. I absolutely love the idea of this game and it seems to be executed very well. It's important to keep a balance between having having more powerful pieces at your disposal and keeping your pieces  low so that your opponent can't get as many points for capturing them. I appreciated also that so many variants were included with the game although I've only played the base game.

A great chess variation with little dice you rotate.  Playing with basic chess rules and a backstabbing the queen edition.  No kings, edition of a pyramid that cannot be captured.  It's a fun little game, and very cheap so I have 2.

RATING: 7
An interesting Chess variant.  Lacks the Chess endgame, which is a good thing in my eyes, but probably has to be played aggressively for optimal results.  I might slightly prefer this over Chess, but it is decidedly inferior in my mind to Shogi.

Production: clear symbols, but very simple.  Play: I don’t like chess.  I do like dice, but these dice never get rolled, so this is chess with even another layer of strategy layered on.  No thanks.  (1+0+1) (1 play)

Takes chess basics and actually makes a fun game from it.  I think the knight and bishop should be switched in promotion order though.  With every piece starting on black, early bishops dominate.

Played twice.  I'm not a fan of chess, but I had fun with this.  It's highly portable (given the assumption that a chessboard exists, or with the addition of the Loony Labs Chessboard Bandana) and pretty fast to play.  The changing pieces make it not as dry as Chess.

A quick, fun and challenging twist on a timeless classic.  A word of caution: the fork move, so efficacious in chess, is not as useful in this game.

Little more than a Chess variant, but an interesting one. Kind of weird and it feels very unpredictable despite being a perfect information game with no luck.

Kids were into chess and wanted to spice it up for them: WOW!  This is great as a filler.  All jokes aside, I would say this is to chess what Munchkin is to Roleplaying.  It's a light look at a classic.  Fast fun and unpedictable.  This is not for chess masters but for light escape from chess.  Get points and feel good.  Can Steve Jackson pick-em or what.

Interesting chess variant that I haven't played in ages. I seem to have rated it kind of low, but I have no recollection of why. For now I bump it up to a neutral 5. 

Note: Like chess, there is no luck in this game. You don't actually roll the dice.

RATING: 8
There are more options in this game than in chess. I have more luck getting my husband to play this game than chess. 

Victory is based on the point total of all the pieces taken from the opponents dice rather than checkmate. Very solid system.

I use the Proteus pieces to play "Royal Battles", a free P&P game than can be found here on the Geek. They're perfect for that, and anyway I prefer "Royal Battles" to "Proteus".

I picked it up at a convention over the weekend and am very pleased so far.  It's easy to teach, being very familiar looking-- yet it plays very differently than chess.  I'm enjoying it.

I hate chess, but this is very different from traditional chess. The game is very strategic and plays in a fraction of the time it takes to play standard chess. The rotation of the pieces is a brilliant mechanic.

Fun, quick and brutal chess variant. The only catch is that we think the point values for the knights and bishops are reversed, but there's an official variant included that addresses that issue directly. Recommended for those who like chess variants.

I definitely leveled up my geek card on this one. One day I was poking around here on BGG and stumbled on the page for this little gem of a game. Without even having seen a physical copy, I was in love.

Sadly, I would come to find that SJG has discontinued it due to lack of profitability. This was confounding. Chess is an international sport! How could they not find their way into that market?? There are literally thousands of books written and published about chess, and tens of thousands of chess players and clubs all over the world. Seemed a failure on SJG part on marketing to me.

Here's where I leveled up. One very generous thing SJG did do was to publish the full rules sheet in PDF form on their website. With that, all I needed was to order 16 blank dice cubes from a gaming website and carved a set with a dremel tool. It was a labor of love. Since then I have carved two more sets for friends as gifts, and they both loved it.

The game - like regular chess - is easy to teach/learn, but rich with complex strategy. It brings a creative new life to a game that I already loved. And there are several rules variants in the booklet that will add even more hours of fun. This game is a must for any serious chess fans out there.

It´s similar enough to chess to mantain the essence but it has got enough differences not to smell as actual chess does.

My favorite chess variant.  The game stresses discovered attacks and forks in a way I find appealing.

I can get people to play this that won't play chess.

With the Chess Bandana from Loney Labs, it is highly portable.

An interesting chess variant where you get to change your pieces every turn. There's also a nice Steve Jackson twist called, well, "backstabbing". As usual with SJ, the game does not contain any chess board. But you can use the dice in some other games(like the Game of Amazon - you need the queens).

Clever little chess variation, I really enjoy this one.  It's frustrating at first because it's much more difficult to plan your moves ahead of time, but if you get good at reacting to the changing board there's some real rewards.

as soon as one player pulls a little ahead, they typically pull WAY ahead.  So, this ends up being a much more brittle game than chess, with only the early game being interesting.  Not as good as actual chess, but it has better dice...

Seems that when it gets down to just a couple of dice apiece, it takes awhile. (A smaller board might make it quicker.)

It is enjoyable though, and fairly fast if both players are driving it to the endgame.

One of my favorite chess variants.  Clever and small, but adds several new angles to standard chess play.  If you're a chess fan (or maybe even more so if you're not a fan of Chess because you're tired of playing with people who've memorized games and plays), you will enjoy this.

I think what sets this game apart and makes it so unfun is the way being a witch works.  There's a lack of plausible deniability for your actions.

New Salem has finally managed to get me to warm up to social deduction games. It has succeeded where other games of its ilk have only failed and irritated. Unlike Werewolf, there is no player elimination and subsequent down time. Unlike Resistance, it doesn't amount to an, "argument in a box" when people endlessly just shout about who is a traitor and the loudest voice ultimately convinces the crowd to make whatever seems least rational and most rooted in group think. It isn't too dated like Shadows over Camelot or too long like Battlestar Galactica. No, New Salem is a breath of fresh air. The use of hope as a currency ensures a finite amount of time is spent largely collaborating on ways to reduce despair by triggering events. People can deduce witches from puritans through both observation and discussion. Reasonable evidence is abundant but not overly so. The art, and overall production is excellent as well. In fact, my only gripe is set up and put away time due to the numbered cards akin to 7 Wonders. An acceptable issue as it is easily mitigated by the player group helping to put it away after a game.

Have to be very careful about the characters that are chosen for the character pool.  When chosen randomly, you can end up in a kingmaker scenario if one person ends up with uniquely desired building types and everyone else is vying for two or three different building types usually they win.  This happened in an all puritan game.

RATING: 6
Played once, at EuroQuest 2015. It's an interesting hidden identity game (kind of like Cunning Folk but with more rules). Hard to say without more game play whether it's unbalanced against the witches or not. Essentially, though, it's just a card drafting and set collection game with a few twists.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Played 2 times. The drafting bit is pretty light, more Sushi Go than 7 Wonders... It's just straight set collection on 2 axis. It seems to exist mostly to provide reason to (or deniability to) choose a card with "despair" cubes on it.

The social game is pretty interesting, especially that players are on secret teams and generally have to share resources in order to get anything done. This is the "meat" of the game, the drafting just provides random resource distribution and a bit of information control (if I pass 2 despair cards and the person on my right doesn't toss them, but plays one that doesn't even match, I maybe learned something.)

Do not expect tremendous strategic depth in the drafting part. This is definitely a social game, with the other elements added to provide coherent reasons for players to gain white or black cubes, regardless of what team they are on, so that players will be able to argue about each others' intentions. If you don't like games where you MUST argue and lie and negotiate, you won't enjoy this.

Card drafting, hidden role and village building. Cute game, and I like that all players can potentially lose even with no Witch in the game at lower player count. My wife and I met and lived in Salem Mass so I think this will see plenty of table, more to do than in pure hidden traitor stuff like The Resistance.

Initial Impressions:
---------------------
7 wonders with hidden roles, and way less interesting choices on what cards to draft.  Game has very little choices, and at the day just isn't very much fun.  There are MUCH better card drafting games out there, and I would rather just play one of those.  Only played with 4, but i expect this one really needs more players to at least be somewhat fun.

What happens when you take a bunch of mechanics from other games and throw them together and put a cool spooky theme on it, you basically get this game.  Unfortunately it just doesn’t work and its pretty underwhelming.   It wants to be a card drafting game, it wants to be a hidden role game, it wants to be a set collecting game, it wants to be a cooperative game yet at the same time competitive, but putting all these things together in this game just doesn’t work.  The whole time I kept thinking, I’d rather be playing 7 Wonders, I’d rather be playing Saboteur, I’d rather be playing Resistance.   And for Set Collecting, I would rather be playing Tokaido.  In order for this game to try to be all those things, it is light on each of them and there isn’t much left.  
Some good things about this game is that it is quick; usually less than 30 min per game.  Also, if you have played a lot of games, you can learn this thing really quickly as there are no really new (or original, for that matter) game mechanics.  When you get cards during the drafting, it’s pretty obvious what you are going to pick and doesn’t require the depth of something like 7 Wonders.  
Twice when we played, only one player was a designated witch.  This means that the witch-player really has a 0% chance of winning and has to sit there for the 30+ minute duration of the game knowing this.  The player promoting the game said that the single-witch situation was unusual and only happens 10% of the time.  I thought, ‘so basically you’re saying the game is broken 10% of the time you play it’ which is really unacceptable by today’s gaming standards.

Tested it out 4, all I can say is always play with 6+ so you have the possibility for 2 witches. I can see what this game is trying to do but negotiation/social deduction hidden role things are very over done ATM and this one just didn't capture any cool moments for me

I would be willing to try it out one more time in a big group setting with the right people but I'm just not a fan of this genre of games anymore

After 2 4-player games. Hope I'm missing something in the rules but as it is not a good game. Choices are so limited and the good players had no chance just against 1 witch. Game play is really 4 but gets a +1 bump because the art is awesome.

I was really excited to pick this up at gen con.

:star::star::nostar::nostar::nostar:
A many-against-one type of game that unsuccessfully tries to combine Werewolf with 7 Wonders. After receiving their secret role cards, players draft cards to play in their tableau. These cards can be worth points at the end, but also usually add either white (hope) or black (despair) cubes to the pool. The hope cubes can be spent for special actions, and the number of despair cubes determines which side wins the game. Interesting concept, but pretty limited game play.

great game. great art. easy to learn & quick play through with almost no waiting time! What can you expect more of a game that can be played with even 8 Players?
i read the other comments and have to say, that the lower rankings are not fair to the game. There are so much diverse situations in that game and it all depends on your ability to act & react on the other players actions and comments. The better you are the better you can fokus on suspicions and hints and make the game work the way YOU want.  
this maybe is one of the best Kickstarter games i ever bought!

I have played a 3 and a 4 player game with mixed results.  Fun enough, but I'm hoping it comes to life with more players.  There is some small piece missing, but I haven't put my finger on what it is yet.

After a six player game I have lowered my rating.  There is really something amiss with this one.  It's not bad, it just doesn't seem finished.  I have some house rules to try before I write it off.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
My biggest problem with this game is that the witches are at a severe disadvantage in that the ability to look at roles (confession) is too cheap and unlimited.  If a witch is revealed, it is too difficult to recover because they are almost guaranteed a trial card will be placed on them making them almost ineffectual. And it's not something that occurs in only a small amount of games; it happens pretty regularly.  There are much better social deduction games that are more balanced.

That being said, the artwork is nice and I liked the idea of the interconnected tableau.  Unfortunately, not enough to want to play the game again.

I'm not super crazy about hidden role games, but haven't really played that many of them. This one didn't do a lot to convince me. We had four witches and were all more or less new players and so the villagers never stood a chance. Options on a turn weren't particularly interesting, either. Add in the weird building-completion thing, which exists solely so that instead of a team winning an individual person can win, because some folks can't deal with there not being a sole winner, and this is the perfect depiction of Not My Thing. For a bonus cherry on top, include a poorly-explained promo card (Tom Commands) which can severely break what game there is.

Step One: Overworld makes a game. Step Two: I back it. That's the entire story of why I backed this, but I'm glad I did. It's basically a set collection social deduction game where you're either trying to hang the witches or survive. There's a winning team (Salem or the Witches) and a winning player (whoever earned the most set collection points). I have yet to win win, but I've always been on the winning team because yay social deduction!

I ended up selling this at GenCon because I couldn't get it to the table over social deduction games, but I still think it's solid.

That's a good mix of card drafting and social deduction. I love that each player has to both work for the entire team but also for oneself, because in the end there is only one winner. Also, if you are in the right mood the artwork is awesome, but if you are not it can put you off from playing the game altoghether.

A mistake in rule-reading caused the game to feel very unbalanced to me, and I look forward to playing it again to possibly make my judgement even better. Fun one!

This nonsense where one team wins but then only one player on that team is the TRUE winner is an atrocious game mechanism that belongs in the trash heap.  If people have teammates but do not have a strong incentive to assist those teammates, then the game sucks right off the bat.  Shuffling the discards in with the cards that have not yet been drawn is also a terrible feature that feels like a bug.

This game left us all unsatisfied. It takes a role mechanic with two teams (a la Resistance) and adds a card drafting mechanic. You are either a villager or a witch. The witches win if there are a certain amount of gloom tokens at the end of all rounds, if there are less, the villagers win. The cards serve to add gloom and joy to the game, where joy is used to take some actions helping either side. At the end, the cards also serve as points, so your side must win and then you need the most points to be the individual winner. But the interaction is minimal where you can easily determine who is who and then just race for points.

I think Salem has enough game to it besides just it's social deduction, but also NEEDS that social deduction to create the conflict and confusion.

So there may be witches in our town. We have to try to stop their evil from spreading. let's work together. (but I will work to make sure I win with your help rather than the other way around.) But if enough evil is spread around, then whatever witch scored the highest will win.

First Impression:

A party game where you try to get your team to win, then try to be the top of your team. 

It sounds better than it is because in practice you'll play a solo game helping towards one objective if you're in one team, and against it of you're in the other. Little room for smart play, little room for bluffing, no room for cooperation. This game is less than the sum of its parts.

We still had a blast though unfortunately it was only because one player misunderstood the rules, not because of the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
New Salem is a social deduction game with two teams, witches and Puritans. The witches are trying to put despair on the board, while the Puritans are trying to spend hope to remove despair from the board (or prevent it coming out in the first place). There's also personal goals which decide an individual winner for the winning faction.

NS is a drafting game. Each player has a secret role which determines whether they want despair on the board or not. Furthermore, it tells the player which suits they prefer. Players are trying to play cards of their preferred suit and make sets in order to further their individual score. But cards you want may have hope, despair or nothing on them. Making a set may force you to put despair on the board even if that's contrary to your group win condition.

In the first and last round you're drafting 3 cards, in the second and next to last you're drafting four cards. And in the third round you're drafting 5 cards. When you're down to a choice between two cards, you can ditch them both for a random draw.

There's ways to spend hope which mostly help you identify and nullify the witches. One aspect of the game is convincing other players to give you their hope(s and dreams) in order to do something. Of course, whether you do it or not depends on your secret role, how convincing you want to be, etc.

In an 8 player game there are 2-4 witches and 6-8 Puritans. Our game seemed very unbalanced in favor of the witches, as we well exceeded the needed despair. There was some thought that perhaps the Puritans needed to be a little more aggressive in targeting suspected witches. And that perhaps Puritans needed to avoid playing despair at all costs and focus on hope only, even if that meant sacrificing their personal goals. I suspect that the game might still be unbalanced even then. But it also sets up a weird semi co-op situation where there's incentive for one of the Puritans to ignore the group win so as to secure their individual win. That risks their team losing outright, but I know players who would rather the whole team lose if they couldn't personally win.

It was interesting and seemed to have potential but I think may be flawed. I wouldn't really be opposed to playing it again, but I'm not sure if it is really worth further plays.

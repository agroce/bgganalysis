Another fantasy sports game in a now crowded market. This suffers from the same problem as Dreadball, notably after scoring a goal/touchdown or whatever it's meant to be, the players remain where they are. Blood Bowl worked so well because it is a clearly defined a version of a know sport with added elements.

Just play Blood Bowl.

Tentative rating based on one demo game.  Gameplay and flavor was at least solid and perhaps much better.  Played very quickly... but that may have been the result of the smaller pitch, smaller teams, and streamlined rules.

Still, promising enough that I'm going to spend a small fortune on it.

Great game; has an awesome and dynamic activation system that keeps things going back and forth. Has some balance issues that can be tough to overcome as new players (1st turn advantage), but the lore and setting are great and the game is a ton of fun. I'm really enjoying digging into the strategy and learning more about it with every play.

RATING: 8
Essentially a slick small scale skirmish game.

Each Guild has a large pool of unique players and you choose half a dozen of these to form your team. There are currently 9 Guilds to choose from and they are all very different in terms of play style, look and feel. With Season 2 introducing a lot of new characters it means that you can really tailor a team to your own way of playing.

Games are played until one player achieves a set number of Victory Points. These are awarded for taking out opponents in combat, but the higher awards come from scoring goals, which elevates this above just a standard fight.

Characters have a lot of different abilities, many of which interact with others, and the real strategy in the game is how you use these to your advantage. 
Each character generates Influence which you distribute at the start of the turn. This resource allocation adds a nice element of bluffing as you try and guess what your opponent is planning while misdirecting him at the same time.

The dice system is simple D6, rolling a pool of dice against a target number with a handful of straightforward modifiers. In combat. You can use you successes to activate character plays, from dealing damage, to tackling, to setting your opponent on fire. 

The Season 2 rules include a campaign system, too, including sponsorships to improve your players.
The models are excellent, really enjoyable to paint, and with more models and potentially more Guilds on their way this feels very much like a game with a lot of life in it.

I received a team (Hunters) in trade for some miniatures I wasn't going to get around to painting.  Watched a few videos on how the game played and managed to play an intro game.  It appears to be a solid enough game but far too exacting of a miniatures game for me with way to precise of measuring, too many conditions requiring too many counters and too many special abilities.  Additionally, seemed to have a poor mind's eye theater experience (important for a miniatures game) as I had a hard time reconciling the game mechanics to what I though the players were doing.  Finally, For all the dials, levers, and gears going on the game strangely seemed to boil down to some arbitrary important dice rolls (initiative and ball scatter) on which player had the stronger position.  Might appeal to miniatures players who enjoy Infinity or Warmachine but did nothing for me.

I've only played Guild Ball twice, which has been enough to establish that it isn't to my tastes. My 2 plays of Guild Ball were extremely slow and quite boring, so much so I abandoned both games (a 3v3 after the first goal, and a 6v6 after a couple of hours with no points scored). I found it difficult to be precise in moving the miniatures, and when applying the templates in a crowded area I couldn't avoid knocking the miniatures a little. The characters have too many special abilities to keep track of (a problem compounded by the difficulty of identifying the miniatures without careful inspection, as well as by the fact that half the characters' information is on the reverse of their cards: this is a bad design choice, all that information needs to be face up at once).

I'm willing to believe the experienced players that Guild Ball becomes exciting and fast when the players have some experience,, but for me it's not interesting enough to persevere to reach that point. I suspect miniatures games are just not for me

Not to bad for a skirmish/football game. It does have a Malifaux feel to it but the influence for activations is a nice alternative to fixed actions per activation. The game does still feel a bit like the best option 80% of the time is to just move up and spend all your actions hitting someone; though even there momentum and counter attacks make that a strategy that could be costly. I'd probably get one team to play but wouldn't go crazy on this.

I thought this was going to be another BloodBowl wannabe but I couldn't have been more wrong. I was very, very pleasantly surprised at how much I like this game; the individual characteristics take tactics to a much higher level... that fact that EVERYTHING you need to start playing can be had for free is amazing... what's not so amazing is once I realised how great it was I dropped wedges of cash on stuff anyway!

And even my totally-hisorical-only grognard mates think the figures are among the best they've seen and the gameplay is 'tempting'.

If you're on the fence, don't be. Lace up your boots and get on the pitch!

GB has been out in retail less than 12 months but is already one of my absolute favourite tabletop skirmish games.  Models look amazing, game has loads of deep synergies and tactics, rules are still super easy to understand and the game plays fast once you've had a few games.  At time of writing still about 2 months away from the launch of the Season 2 rulebook and a whole new Guild - this will be a game to watch in 2016!

A minis sports game not rooted in Yankee culture, is a massive draw for me. 
Oh happy day :)

Gameplay is just fantastic, a thinking man's sports game for grown ups. Held out for 46 years, but I have now played a tape measure game. But well worth the wait and the leap into new territory though. what a game!...

RATING: 7
I was a bit overwhelmed in my first game but it was an interesting game nonetheless! Rating may go up as I play more. There were so many choices to make. I felt like the game was a little too long though. Wish it was just a bit shorter.

Edit:
This game is quite fun but my problem with it still stands - it just takes a long time to understand. I've played about 15 games now and I still make mistakes that are game changing (preface that I am a gamer, albeit this is the first tabletop game I've ever played). There are a lot of rules and a lot of choices to make, which, in the end, makes this game what it is. But I wish there was a faster way to learn, to not forget things, and to pick up new guilds/see what guilds work best for my play style. However since there isn't, I've just had to pick a guild and stick with them, having to adapt myself to them which can be quite frustrating at times. I really want to like this game, and part of me does, but overall I am not in love with it (yet).

It's been one of if not the most enjoyable game I've played. It is also now the game that I've played the most (of the games I've logged on BGG - which I've been pretty good about logging games) and I only just started playing it in OCT/NOV.
Game is well balanced (no points so no min maxing). Every game I've played whether someone won 12-0 or 12-10, the opponent has felt like they were in it; like they had a chance to win. I've won 12-0 and felt like I barely pulled it out. 
And it's one of very few games i could sit and watch other people play... It's like watching a sporting event in that regard.
The rules are free online and they even have free paper doll figures to print and play without ever paying a penny (other than ink and paper). It's that good.

Never thought I'd get into a miniatures game, as the hobby aspect is pretty daunting at first--but this is a fun system. Played about 4 intro games with paper dolls, and 3 with a friend's models, before buying in. Deep tactics and synergies, fast-paced turns with little downtime, dual economies to manage, huge fistfuls of dice. Yeehaw.

These minis games just aren't my thing. I knew that going in, but I had heard that this was one of the better ones out there. Turns out it's just a game where you imprecisely move figures around a board, and roll dice when you need to attack each other or manipulate the ball. Sorry, but I prefer a grid-based system for this kind of thing.

Why this is the best game I have ever played:
1) The makers of this game are great stewards of their game.  When something is out of balance, they bring it back into balance in a way that doesn't loose character flavor.  Instead of swinging the nerf bat on game updates, they employ the concept of increasing polarization (e.g. if a glass cannon player feels too tanky, keep their damage output high, but curb their health or defense).
2) The learning curve to get the basics is shallow, but the skill cap is very high, so this game tends to award the best players.
3) Games are never over until they are done.  It happens quite often when I play where I am behind and I can turn the flow of the game and pull out a victory, unlike MTG, Warhammer, etc. where when you are behind, pack up your stuff because there is no chance to come back.
4) The low player count makes the games quick.  The more you know your characters, the faster the games go.  I went from a 3 hour game per game to 1-1.5 on average.  There is nothing better than bashing out a thrilling match in 1 hr
5) The miniatures are amazing, but not impossible to paint, and the model count is so low that if you are awful at painting, commissioned painting is a thing

While I have not played much, I find this game uninspired. The rules are a little better than Blood Bowl, but in the end I may just not like the sports theme in games. The wide field, interesting synergy between players and combat mechanics are intriguing. The 4 dice bonus for "charging" seems a little extreme IMO.

Perhaps it was that the person giving the demo was not very good at presenting the game, but it just did not impress me. There is a large disadvantage in moving your characters within the attack range of enemies (and someone has to enter attack range first). There are a lot of rules but there is not much depth.

The idea of soccer + tactical miniatures combat sounds like it could be good, but the game did not really capture the feel of a sport (fast, close action) and it felt like we had a fight in the middle of the field while the ball handler stood out of the way and tried to sneak around the side.

Picked up GB Season 2 book at GenCon 2016, along with the Engineer starter and some models.

The fluff is much more interesting than I thought initially.  This is like a dark fantasy setting with a smidge of sport thrown in as opposed to Blood Bowl or something similar.  There are Machiavellian influences driving player actions of the field, and the Guilds are almost like dark puppet masters chewing through the players for political purposes.

Looking forward to giving the game a shot.

Fantastically smooth & highly thematic ruleset which offers intensely strategic play and yet remains immensely simple to learn.

Great game. A clear leader in the "Combat Sports" Genre. I prefer this game over Blood Bowl simply on the fact on how much control you have over your players movements, abilities, and success. Even though dice rolls are a factor of the game, its not as much as dominating force as it is with Blood Bowl.

awww come oooon! minutes to learn! yes of course it is correct, it is "minutes" , but not as in "a couple of minutes". This is not my kind of game, i don't like to have characters to study and small texts to learn with loads and loads of details, statistics and so on. it takes a lot just to remember the meaning and the list of all the powers of your team and your opponent's one. 
Apart from this, this game is somehow fun if you manage to think yourself in the midst of a real game.
To me it's a 6, i know it's not much but coming from me, it's a big deal!

This was an online game between myself and a friend and something of a testing grounds to see if this is a game I want to play in real life. After our 3v3 game on a 2’x3’ pitch, I can say that I can’t wait to play. It’s a ton of fun and has a lot of interesting ideas that I haven’t seen much before. In addition it has that slice of life sort of style that makes it seem like a totally legitimate sport that might have been played in a fantasy world. I’m very much looking forward to playing this in person.

Recommended, but it’s a miniatures game, know what you’re getting yourself into.

Two player (or team vs team) fantasy soccer skirmish pitch miniature game.  Bruisers vs Butchers, team factions (assembly and painting required or print-and-play) and other expansion guilds with different specialties. Might and magic. Measure, move, kick, and attack.  The spell and effect condition tokens are helpful to resolve modifiers.  Clever hit system that triggers escalating choices depending on the character and number of successes. The scatter effect seems too random but the effect isn't too significant to make it swingy.  The core engine strikes a good balance between game pace and meaty decisions with intuitive cause-and-effect modifiers, reactions and resolutions.  I'm happy with how the obstacles, terrain, ball movement and goal scoring interact in the contest and do not feel bolted on--and the same holds for the attack rules to cart off opponents to the bench for an ice sponge.

RATING: 8
A quick session, quick set-up 4-player interactive beer ’n’ pretzeller. Smooth mechanics throw numerous decision points at gamers in this cut throat card-driven deck builder where added randomness determines the interplay of Barbarian tribes and world events. Soloable as is (7/10 based on my plays) and will eventually be graced with a Bot engine standing in for 1-3 factions. GMT “Deluxe” components and a mounted map round out this very clever design package. I forecast my rating will increase on the official solitaire system’s release.

Interesting use of deckbuilding without randomness (and therefore also without constant shuffling).  Well designed, plays smoothly and has quite a bit of emergent gameplay.

8 -> 7 after second play.  Dice cooperated in the first game, but were all over the place in the second game.  Far more reactionary than strategic play.  Still, it's a unique game that I'd play again.

RATING: 7
Played once.  I tried one strategy but I found it it was total luck of the dice whether it would work or not. The cards get progressively stronger at each stage so the player who gets to those cards first has an advantage. The game suffers from runaway-leader.  Maybe a few more plays where everyone knows the game well and it may work better.

I want to like this game - my sort of game - but the ability to select your next hand from an available deck seems to result in a lot of downtime in a 4 player game - I won but was past caring after 3 hours

Time of Crisis is a game about political and military conflict. Ignore one in favour of the other and the game or your opponents will bite you on the bum.  It is card driven, using a deck that you build (and thin).  The interesting aspect of this deckbuilder is that you make a plan at the end of your turn and then select the cards to fulfil it from your available supply.  This is a blessing because there are no turns dictated by poor blind draws.  This is a curse because the game and opponents may re-order your priorities before your next turn.  

The selection of cards to add to your deck is small and their availability is determined by the number of provinces you control. Hence, the variety of card actions that can be taken is quite small, making card values that can be spent to enhance board position the main focus.  Quite rightly, Italia is the main source of vps and, from limited experience, controlling it and being Emperor for at least a turn or two seems essential.

Time of Crisis is a very well developed, very streamlined game.  With that streamlining has gone both some period detail and variability beyond the random events and barbarian invasions, and the actions of other players.

Production quality is good, even by a euro gamer's standards.  The map is good looking and functional.

RATING: 9
A really good solid multi-player deck-building wargame with a quick playing time. Four players all new finished in about 3h40, and I think 3 hours once you were familiar would not be difficult. There is lots of opportunity for interaction, and banter, without an obvious problem of runaway leader or players being backed into a boring and impossible possible for hours. The deck building works very well, and there are lots of options for strategies and supporting decks. Not a 'wow' game in the sense of bringing something desperately new, but really solid and playable and tied in to some nice history.

Wow, after two plays of this, have to say its very enjoyable. Not a heavy wargame by any means but captures the chaos of the Roman Empire in the 3rd Century in a streamlined way. The card drafting and hand building mechanic is very Euro style but lots of decisions on what strategy to follow and keeping an eye on other players.

Brilliant game that melds euro mechanics with war game mechanics and elements of an ameritrash feel.  Ultimately this is King of Tokyo meets Dominion with a few other things thrown in too.  The bash the leader or they will run away with it mechanic works well to incite action and there is a good range of choices.  Where this really impresses though is the simplicity of the game for the amount of interesting choices, theme and history it puts into the game.  The no-shuffle deck building is certainly something euro games should do to explore more with/ steal.

Provisional rating on first play would be 8 out of 10. A solid innovative Euro-Combat game that delivers lots of action/mayhem and offers a decent playing time while still providing that big game and empire build feel. Possible issues could be AP/downtime as one player must finish their entire turn out first, some minor rules issues starting off as per normal and best advised for strong situationally aware gamers that are proactive and aggressive in their gaming approach.

A fun  easy to learn war game. Seems to scale well with 2-4 players. The firsshort game attempt took about 3 hrs with 3 players, but we had numerous interruptions. The second game took us four hours but we played the long game. 

I dropped the rating from an eight to a 7. Still a good game but I think you need four player so to have Italia pass hands a few times. Otherwise whoever gets it first seems to get a run away win.

First play was a short game where the first and only emperor won handily. Almost got taken out in the first one/two turns by barbarians and bad rolls but that's a wargame for you. Still rather light for a wargame but quick and fun enough. 3p took 90 mins even with reading cards because the emperor had done a good job entrenching himself. looking forward to more plays and a seemingly good intro into wargames.

RATING: 4
So, I was not a big Sword of Rome fan - I ultimately felt like the design had a bunch of serious problems - so there was no major reason to expect I’d like Time of Crisis. But I wanted to give it a try just because the form factor (4 players, 8p rulebook, moderate playing time) was appealing.

And as it turns out, I did not like it much. It’s basically the same thing we’ve seen a million times - a 4-way king-of-the-hill game with open scores and an attritional combat system and where everyone has equivalent starting positions and the same resources and the same set of options in which nobody can really gain any kind of major advantage on anyone else so it just degenerates to a grind. It’s so depressing to see another one of these things after all these years. 

There also seems to be a major endgame problem, or at least one. The thing that killed me was just that once you get a pretender going the scores of people who can be emperor really start to tank so grinding out the last few turns can be a real nightmare. The Emperor players can’t get enough points to force an end, be because the pretender is subtracting from their score so they may only be eking out a couple points; nobody wants to be Emperor because its too hard to score. But you can’t force the game to end unless you’re Emperor, and the clock of the Event cards is not reliable. It’s just a real mess. 

I was also kinda shocked at how bad the rules for this were. We ran into a number of pretty obvious rules problems, and the way the rules are structured is totally perverse. It’s not the worst thing in the world for a bunch of wargamers who are used to playing fast and loose with rules that maybe aren’t as clear as they should be, but for eurogamers who want to get it right and want the model to work, you can get pretty bogged down in a few areas. The games is also pretty over-chromed even at just 8-ish pages of rules; lots of fiddly subsystems with inconsistent mechanisms (mobs, barbarians, pretenders) with rules reminders inadequately built in to the game's physical and graphic design.

Games like this are hard to do, but there are enough exemplars now - Successors, Pax Porfiriana, Dune, Titan, Pax Pamir, many 504 variations with Military in I or II, possibly even Fire in the Lake - that doing something mediocre like this, with all the traditional and obvious issues, is a bit disappointing.

I also think that if this could have been pared down to 90 minutes, 2hr tops, and with a considerably tighter pace of play, it would be a lot more forgivable. But the four hours this goes on - especially with the big, complex, late-game turns - it just gets to be an ordeal.

However, as a final note, my comments apply only to 3 and 4 player games. I’ve heard 2p is a rather different beast and I can see it would have a very different dynamic.

Well thought out game with lots of interesting options. I like the fact that the legions are all named. It would have been nice if the governors were as well. Notes for next play: Start with 3 reds and 2 blues. Take over a neutral territory by buying a general with a legion, moving to the region, then buying a governor and installing him. Grab a third territory as soon as possible, increase the governors' influence, build some limes for defence and VPs and buy some 3 point blue cards to recruit nearby barbarians. Incidentally, the 3 point red cards ability by comparison seem quite weak since you have to declare their use in advance.

Game about turmoil times of the 3rd Century Roman Empire.
Very good combination of non-random (deck-building) and random factors (barbarian invasion, battle resolution, events) supported by short playing time (max. 3 hours).
Game is more abstract in its nature than most of similar titles (level of chrome is not quite adequate for history buffs, which like to argue about length of gladius, etc.), but gives a lot of fun in play. It has very good replayability, which is crucial strength.
Minor quibble - game is so fast (usually 10 turns at most before 60+ Legacy condition appear), that in 4-value cards events, only useful is Preatorian Guards.
Very good, highly recommended game.

RATING: 7
A curious marketing decision made here by GMT: the packaging seems to promise a Deep Historical Study Of A Complex Time Period and the actual game is a pretty light deckbuilding Euro-wargame hybrid with very little in the way of historical chrome. Don't judge this book by it's cover.

As for the actual game: pretty, pretty, pretty good. It seems to be trying to do a lot of what Mythotopia was grasping for, but actually sticking the landing a bit more cleanly.

The question, to me, is one of staying power. Time of Crisis lays out the cards available for purchase in large stacks right from the get-go, Dominion-style. But unlike Dominion, where a given game starts with 10 available cards chosen from a set of 25, ToC has 9 cards available from a set of, er, 9. The question then becomes: is the game on the board compelling enough to compensate for the fact that you have the same cards available every game.

Don't know. Only played once. But: maybe?

RATING: 9.3
For me deck-builders come down to two things. The first is figuring out the best combos and the correct pivot point from engine-building to scoring. The second is forcing players to cope with the noise of their deck and the interference from others. These are, regrettably, rickety foundations for good game design. Virtually every Dominion card bank has a solution, so the game needs expansions and noise to keep players coming back. The "card market" deckbuilders (Star Realms, Ascension) don't really fix this problem but instead just offer more noise.

So, when Wray/Johnson announced that this game was going to be a deckbuilder years back  I was worried. Given the subject, I wanted something a little more conflict driven and shaped by the players rather than random card pools. Some of these worries were allayed by a reading of the rules. I was intrigued that the designers had tossed the conventions of the genre out of the window, but I had a hard time imagining how the game was played. Nonetheless, I decided to pick it up, put it on the table, and see how it worked. 

Even teaching the game I wasn't sure if it would all click together. And then, a couple rounds into the game, it did. In a world where content and modular design is everything, Time of Crisis hearkens back to a the set piece designs that built this hobby. It doesn't need randomized setups or a scenario generators. Sure, there are events decks and there are dice, but the design feels almost like a perfect information wargame. Everything matters, and decisions made on the very first turn go on to inform the rest of the game.

And I love love love that this is a game that can be talked about at length. There's a volume of strategy articles waiting to be written about different deck construction styles and the proper timing of the Place Governor action in Italia or different  pretender strategies. This discourse is possible because the game starts the same. There's no tomfoolery about card banks here. All of the cards are there each game--a wonderful toolbox for players to exploit.

And, almost as a bonus, this game offers an robust history of the period that is incredibly subtle and nuanced despite the system's simplicity and seems in tune with some of the best historians working on this period.  

So, all in all, this a great design with a huge amount of promise. Time of Crisis is potentially a genre-defining title.

A few games in, results are mixed. It's not a bad game, and it definitely looks very nice. Instead of the traditional deck building mechanics where you draw from your deck randomly, here you actually build your hand each turn, which is new to me. The barbarian build up, that sooner or later results in an attack, is a nice touch.

Overall, though, something just isn't sitting quite right with me. I'm not sure if it's the downtime (which could decrease with repeated plays), or the feeling that early barbarian attacks can hose you while other players remain unscathed, or just the overall lack of depth. Conversely, the barbarians could also end up as point generators if they happen to dribble into your territory.

And, after thinking about it some more, I don't think I really like the hand building mechanics and the lack of variety in cards that you can choose from - it's always the same 9 cards. To me this defeats the purpose of deckbuilding in the first place since it de-emphasizes the importance of deck construction and limits variety between plays, which is why people generally like deck builders in the first place. The net result is that this ultimately feels like action selection with deckbuilding mechanics bolted on. Plus, it seems to have a bit of a runaway leader problem.

That said, I'd still be willing to play someone else's copy from time to time. Plus, it's short.

Only one play (4-player) and a very nice use of the Dominion deck-building mechanic hooked p to a great theme. Opportunities for both long term strategy and tactical opportunism. The dice will be a little bit too much to the fore for some but it's just about OK for me.

Would have liked to have seen a little bit more period flavour on the player counters - a few names of key actors of the period would have been nice rather than just generic counters but a minor niggle.

I am no war gamer and I dislike dice rolling to determine outcomes.  But [thing=164949][/thing] intrigued me as it is, at heart, a deck builder. 
 Just maybe, I thought, it is a Euro in War Game clothing?  But even though you are building a deck, the game still has the confrontation of a war game, something which I don’t enjoy, and it has the resolution of confrontation with dice, another problem for me.  This, it turns out, is a war game in Euro clothing.  It is a little like a Martin Wallace deck-building war game (A Few Acres of Snow, Mythotopia) with dice chucked in.

The game works and you do get a feel for the political chaos and upheaval during the Fall of the Roman Empire.  But that is not quite enough to make up for the destructive random battles which ensue.  
I am glad I played it, and I enjoyed the game, and it reminded me that, however much Euro-baggage you add on to a war-game, a war game is still a war game.

RATING: 6
I hate to give this a 6 (Ok - will play in the mood) given that it's a squeaky clean copy sitting in my collection, but I wasn't really blown away by the game.  Then again, we were all learning so take what I say with a grain of salt.

Time of Crisis is, in short, a game about civil war in ancient Rome, but it's not a wargame.  Players represent aspiring would-be Emperors vying for influence and control of the Mediterranean.  You do so by spending three different types of influence described on cards to buy actions.  Afterwards, should you have gained enough political influence, you can spend [i]that[/i] influence on getting stronger cards in your deck.

Unlike other deck builders, your entire deck is available to you.  This is both a blessing and a curse.  On the one hand, you're able to pick and choose your hand of cards for your next turn (but you must do so immediately after your current turn) so you can purpose-fit your turn by creating the perfect cornucopia of colored influence points.  On the other hand, this can be incredibly agonizing and also punishes you in a way because you are committed to whatever idea you had only to realize that three players later, your entire idea has been dashed violently upon the rocks and fed to the gulls.

Oh, and then there's the barbarians.  You see, there is a crisis table that you have to roll against at the beginning of every one of your turns - it seems the non-Romans really want in on the empire action.  Something like 9 out of 12 of the possible outcomes of the crisis table have barbarians on the move.  After the game gets underway, the barbarian onslaught is relentless.  Killing them will net you precious points, but it will also take away from everything else you're trying to do, and leaving them alone means they slowly chip away at your influence until you ultimately lose control of the province.  Not fun.

What I dislike about the game is that you have to bash the leader.  There's just no other way to go about the game.  If someone is taking the lead, everyone has to jump on him right away or it becomes a foregone conclusion.  I can't see the game playing out any other way, except perhaps by starting your own empire which is a tough thing to do since you need to secure a lot of space before you can attempt to do so and what with the constant barbarian invasions, you're in for a mountain to climb.

All that said, it's something I'd like to play again and see if it speaks to me, but all I can really say is that I was a bit disappointed, but not disheartened.

Jugado varias partidas a 2 y 3 jugadores.
A dos jugadores no hay que dormirse que la cosa va bastante rápida.
Explicación un poco larga pero muy fácil de jugar.
En mi humilde opiniçon el juego va como la seda. Acciones sencillas y claras para darse tortas de una forma u otra.
El mercado de cartas para la construcción de mazos es pequeño pero me parece que no necesitas más.

Si juegas con jugadores con AP te puede entrar el ansia, pero va bastante rápido.

En resumen, un juego muy divertido y ágil.

I think individual player turns become too long as the game progresses and one can do more with the cards. In the final turns we had downtime of up to 20 minutes for each player (it was a learning game, but still there were many options to consider). Also often you select a hand with which you can do nothing in the end as the game state changes completely until you're up again. Interesting enough game, but certainly no "Euro"....

One learning play with my slow-playing group such that I can't really assess the game. I found it interesting enough to want to revisit at some point, but I was averaging two turns every 50 minutes and the whole thing felt bloated and sluggish, coming in at 4 hours. Most likely due to it being our first play and nobody really understanding how to play well until a couple hours in. I'm sure the next play will be very different. If and when that happens, I'll update this comment.

A really different take on the card driven wargame that simple and plays in less than 3 hours! 

I think I will enjoy exploring this game a lot. There are many options and every game will assuredly be different. I expect my rating will only go up, not down. 

The one thing I think this, and all very light multi-player wargames suffers from is the feeling of ending too early. The first two or three turns will net 2-5 points a player. Then all of a sudden, a couple battles are fought, someone becomes emperor and we're up to 10-20 points a turn. Timing is all too important and I think when timing is a key element in a game, it's hard to get people to keep playing. Luckily, this game is addicting enough to keep trying to get it right!

RATING: 8
Very good integration of board control and deck-building.  The board control generates your income for card buying/trashing and scoring while the deck-building gives you the influences to impact the board state.   Really interesting twist on deck-building as you select your hand for next round at the end of each round.  You still must go though your entire deck before selecting a card again.

RATING: 7
Time of Crisis seems to be a game at the moment that not a lot of people have heard of, but those who have immediately want to play it. Fortunately, I was able to get a copy before it sold out and I can report that it is quite good! The "deck building" aspect works excellently because it's not wholly luck-of-the-draw. You get to draw your hand of cards from your "available pile" of cards you started the game with and newly purchased cards and don't get your discards back until you run through your available cards (typical deckbuilder stuff). But deck sizes are kept small and there are only 9 different cards in the game, so you're never overwhelmed with which cards to put in your hand.  Using these cards for both points to spend on actions and for their optional event text works well. I like that the event text introduce fundamental actions to the game, but they are not introduced until those cards are purchased later on in the game, and so the game starts off at a nice size without being overwhelmed by too many options.  There is luck in this game though, for those who'd rather avoid any luck whatsoever in their games.  The barbarian hordes run on a simple AI and it's possible through dice rolls that one player gets targeted more than others.  But there are decent points to be had for fighting barbarians, so it's best to change up your long-range strategy and go heavy on military to take care of the hordes. This game, as such, feels more tactical at times, but allows lots of room for strategy as every player vies to take the throne in Italia and hold onto it for as long as possible (not an easy thing to do!)  Overall, I found that Time of Crisis didn't blow me away right from first play, but I was very impressed with a good number of its key parts.  I'm rating a '7' now but could easily see this go up to an '8' even by a second play as everything should flow a little better.  I'm glad GMT picked up this game! It's a good direction to go in: middle-weight wargames with modern sensibilities to appear to larger crowds without stripping away too much complexity so that everyone feels like they've played something deep without being overwhelmed.

Best Roman era GMT game I've played to date.  Simpler and shorter than Falling Sky.  Intuitive card drafting mechanic and the potential for barbarian horde invasions is exciting.  Excellent production value.  Played 2 player and probably much better 4 player.  A solo option would have been nice.  Recommend longer 60 point victory condition since player progress can vary wildly during the game.

Components: very good components

Weight: medium
Players: 4, but works with 3
Length: 2 to 2,30 hours
Mechanics: deckbuilding, area control, fighting
Decisions: what cards to select, which provinces to go for, how many legions to move....
Opinion: there is a big crisis in Rome, and we, as very good Romans, will help to that...helping Rome? no, just trying to increase your benefit and take advantage of the situation.
There are many things I like in this game, so I try to mention some.
First of all the deckbuilding, not a standard deckbuilding, you have your deck, but don't shuffle it, when you have to take cards, just select the ones you want from those available. You will need to time when the good ones are available, or which of them you will need
Then the interaction, tons of interaction in the game. The main way to obtain VP's is with your governors, and this is something changing from turn to turn
How everything works together is awesome, in the end you have 3 types of cards (populace, military and senator), and, depending on the ones you use, the actions you can take.
Senators for your governors, you don't have all of them available, you have to recruit them, and they will be more expensive. These are for controlling provinces
Military, to recruit generals (like governors), train legions, recruit legions, move, attack... Your army will help you to take over new provinces, as they will lower what you need, but also will be useful to keep those Barbarians apart (and you have lot of points here)
And populace to make people help you with the support, build some improvements or recruit some militia.
The 3 types work very well together, you need governors to control provinces, army to fight barbarians and people to confirm your power in provinces. And you know? the other families in Rome won't let you do that, so be ready to fight each turn.
Regarding the dice, they don't bother at all. The crisis roll can put some Barbarians on the Horizon, they can invade your provinces, but this could give you lot of points. Some times an event will come, but nothing you couldn't deal with. And the battle is just a roll and hit, with the legions doing so easier
Really lovely game

This is a deck-building euro disguised a Roman-based historical wargame. It could have as well been taking in place in deep space or medieval Europe. Players could play roles of train moguls or car dealers; they happen to be Roman pro-consuls but it does not matter.

It is boring, generic, dull and superficial. Actions are limited, cards are few.

Not wiling to play it ever again.

My first play was with a few rules missing, so the game wasn't as volatile as advertised by geekbuddies. I expect that my rating will go up to an 8 (if not higher) if the game opens up and territory shifts hands more frequently with full and proper rules as the game is neat in its execution and in providing a neat backdrop for dickery.

I think the event deck + barbarians kill this one for me. The space for them to influence the balance of power seems too much after 4 plays. It also seems that you can fairly easily drop out of the contention after a few bad rounds or conversely snowball into unstoppable lead. 

Other than that it seems fairly nice dudes on the map game, I really wanted to like this, but it was not to be.

Only played once, but have played hundreds (thousands?) of strategy games. However, I was extremely impressed with the cleanliness of the the rules, game concept, game play and most particularly the interplay of diverse alternative strategies within and among players. A turn's play is essentially five cards you've selected the turn ahead from a deck that you grow and try to sculpt (a "deck building game"). The inertia window of having to plan your hand ahead in anticipation of your own and the many alternative approaches that you and your opponents can engage was most interesting, but not overwhelming. Definitely felt like something of a simulation of its target subject and a good engaging historical game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The game works well enough and is competently put together, but it needs 4 players and the full (rather than the short) game. Furthermore, it is rather vanilla - there is not a lot to keep your interest through the 2-3 hours required to play it. It is essentially a simple deck-building game with combat. There is no differentiation between the players apart from starting position. I believe it would be much improved by the addition of more period flavour and slightly more complex game mechanics. Overall, a disappointment from the designers of the far more interesting Sword of Rome.

RATING: 9
Preliminary rating after 2 plays of short game. 2 player felt a little weird. 4 player was really good. The game seems really balanced (maybe too balanced?) and the deck building system is well integrated. 

I'm really enjoying the different levels of planning required; you have to plan your next turn in advance when choosing what cards to draw and you have to plan 2 or 3 turns in advance when choosing what cards to buy. While doing this you have to be careful about leaving yourself enough flexibility to respond to the changing boardstate (barbarian invasions, mobs, other players, etc). There seems to be just enough chaos to require player flexibility but not so much that things feel totally out of control.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
I enjoyed a lot my first game. Highly thematically immersive for a quite simple gameplay. A lot of meaningful choices, interaction. It seems to be far better with 4 players than any other play count. People playing need to know how to keep the things balanced. Luck factor is important but it doesn't annoy me for this kind of game, it is instead thematically representative of the chaotic era. Rating should be confirmed with subsequent plays, but I'm really impressed!

RATING: 9
Purchased on a whim and a raft of good reviews.  

The game delivers a large slice of interaction and complex interplay - in simple set of rules.  I'm really looking forward to the next few games.

With AP-prone players the selection of cards at the end of the turn could cause the pace of play to slow down, and it would probably benefit from a house rule to allow the game to move faster.

RATING: 8
Very great game with many layers of strategy. To me, it feels as being the game that Scythe should have been. The tension is real and there are a lot of aggressive player interactions.

Only after a first game, I can see how subtle decisions can have a butterfly effect in the long term. The right choice to make is not necessarily obvious; you need to think outside the box and even be creative to score as many points as you can.

Surely in my top 10 of 2017.

RATING: 9
Very enjoyable multi-player wargame. Excellent deck-building mechanic that minimises clutter and frustration by allowing players to choose the cards they want in their hand each turn from their available cards pile, plus having board position drive card buying / trashing  rather than special deck-management cards that otherwise just clog your deck.

That's the engine, but the other mechanisms are relatively simple and mesh together very well. It seems like a very well developed game that (unlike many otherwise excellent multiplayer wargames) doesn't require a full day to play.

RATING: 6
Time of Crisis combines a multiplayer conflict game with deckbuilding to give some differentiation to players. Each card provides between 1-4 action points of three different types. One type can mainly be used for political actions, one for military actions and the third one for popularity actions. The main constant source of VPs is political control of provinces. Control of Italia additionally gains emperorship and additional VPs. To wrestle control for a territory from another player, a die roll based on the invested amount of political action points has to be made. Military units can positively influence this roll but they don't gain control themselves. Beside aiding in getting political control, they can be used to get VPs from victorious battles against barbarians or other players armies. Popularity can be used to strengthen political control of a province, erect buildings providing VPs and benefits and to buy better cards.

For the genre, Time of Crisis is rather streamlined and quick-playing. Nonetheless, it keeps the characteristics of this type of game. Trying not to be perceived as the leader, bashing on the perceived leader and sneaking in for the win when game end approaches. Luck of the dice can either be punishing or hilarious. Chances are that it won't even out during the duration of the game. I would play again but the differentiation of the only 9 cards to extend your deck with is not interesting enough to overcome my indisposition to the genre.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Sure can tell a story with the dice rolls that occur, etc. Interesting blend of political and military as well as development. I wonder if the game might get repetitive quickly with the limited (9) upgraded cards. Deckbuilding done GMT style is different in that you can choose the 5 cards you want from your deck to play (although you still must play through your deck before re-using your discards). Game can accelerate quickly towards the end, especially if a player is allowed to dominate Italia. Want to play this one more.

First thoughts:

A deck building wargame. I did not think it would've been possible, especially because the concepts of developing a deck which juxtaposed against the control of a board.

The interactions between cards and the board are extremely tight:
- The cards provide an action that situationally affects the board, but the major meat of cards is the 'influence' (think action points) they give you. This influence is used to perform actions of three varieties (military, senate, population).
- The board is an intricate puzzle of interlocking concepts: never-ending waves of barbarians affecting your regional power, military subtly impacting the ability to gain control of regions, and population needs to be used as labor to construct buildings which in turn help you maintain regional power so that you can vie for control of the empire. Your regional power is used to develop your deck and then throw a couple of mobs and an opponent into the mix...
- A player will need to juggle these two pieces together in an attempt to gain enough control over the empire to win the game.

Historicity-wise the game is not a simulation. It abstracts much out of the game.

In terms of mechanical elegance, it suffers from a lot of exceptions, but this is to be expected in a war game. There are also some interesting constraints such as each army can attack once per turn, and movement/recruitment are not restricted until after attacking.

All in all, I am a huge fan. The game is strategic but plays fairly quickly for a war game, there is some complexity, but much of the interactions are pretty straightforward and constitute tactical plays. There are a few rules that could've been explained better (i.e. who constitutes an Emperor versus a pretender, the answer to this is in the definitions section near the beginning of the manual). The varieties of strategy that players can employ are great.

My favorite moment in my first play was when I politically took over Rome from under the nose of my opponent. He aggressively was taking territory that intersected with barbarians and was continually harassed by them. I took advantage of the situation by adding a few mobs for him to deal with as well. After my crowning, I made defensive plays using my new found political power to tailor my deck to deny him of gaining control of Rome. He never had a chance to form a pretender empire by the time I won.

I liked the game (vote 8) but the rulebook is really very bad (vote 1). 
Rules cannot be found in the examples !!!
And during the game there are so many situations not described. 
There are some unclear event cards and there are the main cards with so much text written on the same cards but not clear on what to do in certain situations. 
I hope that a new regulation will be written, I think it is very easy to improve the existing one. It is unthinkable in 2017 (and for the gmt) publish a game with such a lacunous regulation.

Last observation: the game suffers owntown and I do not understand why the number of the best rated players is 4. 
From my point of view the game is for 2/3 players.

I'm not really a deckbuilding game guy, but this one felt different.  The first I have played where you get to select a number of cards from those available, rather than drawing some.  I would need a different approach, though, as I was stuck with poor cards all game.  Needed to expand more early, but did not understand all the implications until too late.  We messed up a couple rules, but will go smoother next time.  Played with three...interested in other player counts.  Decent history to give it a basis to understand the actions.

Played twice with 4 players. Simple rules, but we missed a few scoring details even in the second game. Is a game where you need to time perfectly your move for max impact , and for that is critical to predict the other player reactions, and wait patiently before striking. A lot of interaction between all players, but sometimes a bit chaotic. Is however still a game that rewards well planned moves.

Rather simple and fluid, with a very good production value and a touch of history.
It can drag a bit playing with "slow-thinkers" since you PICK your cards from the deck.

GMT does deck-building! And it's really fun. The cards themselves are fairly intuitive and have a healthy amount of text on them, but this game you get to hand pick your cards for next round. That's both a blessing and a burden, as you stack your hand and then by the time it gets back round to you the board has changed and now the cards are useless. Excellent War-Euro hybrid. I wish there was an optional faction power module,  but that's the euro gamer in me!

Successors meets A Few Acres of Snow. 

Nice take on deck building. 

40pts 'short' variant not worth play (game really gets interesting once players are around 35pts). 

It's really a mid-weight euro with militaristic direct conflict or war-euro hybrid. In the same ballpark as Mythotopia.

It has some interesting design features. Moves along pretty well once you know it, takes 3 or so rounds for it to click with everyone. Nice mix of long/short term planning and tactical reactions to the changing board state. A variety of legitimate different paths to victory.  

Would certainly be quicker with experienced players -- I think it would shine with 4 experienced players.

Plenty to explore, presumably can be played quickly after a teaching game.  Some of the arithmetic is a little inelegant.

Picking the next hand slows the game to a crawl, since the dice rolls on the next player's turn may well affect your strategy.  The currency exchange of actions, buy points and card values was too weird to ever sink in.  The player matts are solid B+ work, but it does not forgive the rule book which is awful for reference and commits the cardinal sin of hiding rules in caption boxes (to my memory).  

Could this game work by "upgrading" your cards rather than adding to the deck?  This would certainly cut down on some of the hand management nuisance.  I feel the central mechanics of buying and playing cards is not especially compelling even though I like the theme, timers and combat.

I should like this game more. In fact, I should love it.

Fascinating setting and era  - check. Hybrid of historical simulation and euro game - check. Clever and tightly-integrated mechanisms - check. Direct and dramatic interaction - check. Manageable complexity and duration - check. 

So why don't I love it? It's difficult to express, except to say that it lacks character. It doesn't have the feel of intrigue and immersion and desperate gambits you would expect a game on this subject matter to have. Everything from the mechanics to the units to the cards has a smooth, generic feel to it. Time of Crisis works. But it doesn't engage my emotions.

Very tentative rating.  The one game I played was a mix of awesome and terrible, but I suspect it may have been bad luck.  The deck building aspects are a step forward and are very well done -- trashing, selecting hands, and 3 types of money/actions all work beautifully.  Random barbarian motion + random dice combat are are not necessarily so great, but I suspect are usually fine.  It certainly solves the attrition problem of multi-player conflict games well.  I'm optimistic that the rating will go up with more plays, but it might plummet if the issues manifest too often.

RATING: 8.5
Very interesting deck-building wargame - still exploring its depth.  I most like the constant pressure from invading barbarians that prevents players from just focusing on attacking each other.  The ability to take over an enemy province politically without attacking is interesting. I perhaps wish there was a bit more variety in cards you could select for your deck - your choice is basically just which color you want and you buy the highest cost one you can afford, rather than much decision about which event effect you are most interested in.  The event deck is interesting but draws pretty slowly - a game not ending until Diocletian appears seems like it would take far longer than 3 hours.  We took a long time and called it even though we all had enough points to win but weren't strong enough to take Italia.  With the Emperor turn counters (all ours were at 0), clearly the designer expects someone to take Italia a lot earlier and then players fight over it, like King of the Hill.  I think we weren't as efficient as we needed to be in buying higher-cost cards and trashing cards to streamline our decks.  Looking forward to more games.  It gives some of feel and flavor of games like Successors and Sword of Rome (same designers), but seemingly with a lot less downtime. We'll have to see if 150-210 minutes is realistic once we're more experienced.  Rules are a little more complicated than they needed to be - the game is actually quite simple. The player aid is great, and if it was just a bit bigger, they could have made sure the player aid included everything you need to know to play.

WARNING: The 2 player game has a severe runaway leader problem. The person who takes Italy first has a huge advantage and can only be countered if the other player prepared for this exactly [article=26763770]the right way[/article] since turn 1.

I will leave the rating at 3 until someone comes up with a 2 player variant that improves the game.

This problem does not occur with 3 or 4 players because the other players can gang up on the leader (which sucks as a game mechanic but at least keeps the game going).

An attempt to make a simpler, faster-paced game but it's not quite there for me. The theme is a little thin -- could have had a wider variety of cards and asymmetrical factions. The opening seems a bit scripted. And it's fiddly -- had issues with keeping track of crisis resolutions at the beginning of the turn, legacy points at the end, and selecting next turn's cards bogs down the flow. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
This is a great game. I have played it now at all player counts. This game certainly shines with 4, and very good with 3. However, I am beginning to have some concerns as a 2 player game, though experience may overcome my concerns. Due to the king-of the hill nature of this game, if one player takes Rome, and the other gets smashed with Barbarians, it seems like it might be difficult to come back from this. It may be the best strategy to ignore the barbarians to keep the pressure on Rome, but it seems very hard to juggle. It seems like you need a 3rd of a 4th player to help keep the emperor in check. Again, more experience may solve these concerns.

Navigating your deck and buy choices are tough, but these choices [i]ARE[/i] the game. There is a lot of murk to wade through, but once you get your deck moving, this game sings. The more I play, the more I see how trashing cards is [i]critical.[/i] It's often more important than buying cards. 1-cards (and possibly 2s in late game) should be disposed of as quickly as possible. A lean deck is a powerful deck. You don't need to buy huge numbers of higher level cards if you can just use the same ones every other turn or so.

Pros:
Streamlined- easy to learn, consistency in mechanisms. 
Thematic
Directly interactive
Deep
Fast- Clocks in under 3 hours, closer to 2 with experience.
Several viable strategies
Simply fun

Cons: 
Luck can play a huge factor. At this point, I still hope/feel that skilled and clever play will overcome luck, but it is a big element. The ability to have full control over your deck and draw choices is a brilliant way to mitigate this. Swings of luck in this game have occasionally left a bad taste in my mouth

I have an inkling that this will be a sleeper hit. It didn't get a ton of buzz, but this game is [i]VERY[/i] good. I think it's only a matter of time for this to catch on in a big way.

I can imagine this being a framework for a deck-building wargame series that features a variety of conflicts with some overlapping mechanisms.

This game could go up to a 9+ rating after a few more plays, or it might just settle in to its nice solid 8.

We saw a runaway leader in our first game, I don't know if that is a persistent problem or not.

Clunky 1st play after a restart, def needs more play and I'm fully expecting the meta to change as we explore the depths this game has to offer. Very promising.

Divided on this one. Probably a bit too 'euro' and simplistic for my groups tastes and I am likely to trade away. A distinct lack of chrome - feels over developed.

Downtime can be a big problem as turns should be quick, but if your turn is only going to take 1 minute yet you have to wait 15 for it to get to you then that's not good.. Since turn order is fixed and there's nothing like reaction you just have to wait..
The rigid IGO-UGO hurts this system almost mortally I would say.

It's important that all players understand the importance of the emperor/pretender interaction, without that you may as well not play and the problem there is that understanding takes experience and multiple plays..

If you are a fan of the mixed Euro/Wargame genre, I think this is a must-own game.  The two-player version plays well.  I love how the game seamlessly combines several game mechanisms that work well together within the context of a strong historical theme:
-- There is a simplified deck-building aspect with an unusual mechanism where you get to choose your hand in advance (*prior* to your opponent's turn) so that you determine the order in which your deck is consumed.  This is key because your hand dictates what categories of actions you'll be able to perform on your turn.  Planning your short and longer term objectives, while anticipating what your opponent will do, requires a fair amount of strategy and forward thinking. 
-- There is an "engine-building" component via the political support you develop within your controlled provinces, which gives you the points needed to buy better cards.  
-- You can buy buildings in your provinces that give you immediate benefits as well as recurring victory points.  
-- There is area control that facilitates a medium level of player interaction, as you directly confront your opponent and compete for provinces.  
-- You have army units to manage (which may be "trained"/healed after battle if they weren't eliminated) that you use to attack opponents, eliminate randomly invading barbarians (if you can't, or don't want to, recruit them into your army), or assist your political objectives.  

I think there is just about the right amount of different things you can do on your turn – about a dozen discrete, easily executed actions – that gives some complexity without being overwhelming.  The learning curve to get acquainted with the game is a little steep (the rulebook is on the moderate size and there are a fair number important little rules to remember) but it's manageable.  There is a little bit of randomness via event cards, unexpected barbarian invasions, and dice rolling during battles, but it is not in any way excessive (or likely to make or break your long-term game strategy), and actually creates a welcome, mild level of unpredictability that is consistent with the chaos of this game's historical period.

Regarding play in a two-player game, a significant flaw that I've found is that when one player falls behind in provinces, it becomes much more difficult for him to purchase certain important and powerful cards.  This is because the rules state that when your owned province count drops below a certain amount (there are only six provinces total in a two player game), certain cards DOUBLE in cost.  This can lead to a situation where the person who is behind has a hard time catching up, as his average card power in his deck falls further behind his opponent's.  However, this issue seems to be easily rectified via a simple house rule: allow all players to buy cards at the same non-doubled cost, regardless of provinces owned.  The Emperor can also be a bit too unbalancing in a two-player game, but there are some house rule tweaks to reduce his power or make it easier to defeat him.

Finally, there could be a little more variety of cards to choose from (there are essentially nine unique types, of which you can have multiple copies in your deck).  However, if this game becomes successful enough, the designer has expressed a desire to produce an expansion with more cards.

So far, I enjoyed it from a first game. Initially high but will need to rethink it after a few more games.

After a couple more games: I think the dice mechanism kills the game for me. I like the card system but the dice are too swingy and the combat too basic to really retain my interest

An utter joy. And not just because I'm a lover of the time period, though that certainly helps. Time of Crisis captures its subject matter beautifully, both in terms of setting and gameplay. The deck-building is cleverly positioned as one more element to manage directly rather than a bunch of random card pulls, but battles are appropriately unpredictable. The conflict between would-be emperors is laid bare, but always fluid and prone to setbacks thanks to barbarian invasion or ill-timed events. Truly as close to perfect as games get for me.

First game impressions: there's something really good going on here & it surprised me. There's a really cool tempo thing that happens as the players grow their asynchronous positions & decks. How you select your hand from the dwindling deck is one of those perfect ideas: what emerges are both opportunities & constraints set by your own choices that get into a lovely polyphony with the others. 

It has an almost Tigris & Euphrates feel to that moment a leader (in this case, gov or general) gets punted from the field. Grin, don't cry, because you get to bring them back pronto.

The dynamics are startling given the relative simplicity of events. Lovely use of dice & long shots get their moments. Lots of actions you can cluster, driven by the growing wealth in card driven OPs that gets pretty cool into the halfway point & onward. 

We just finished a 3-player game & in this afterward-moment I'm thinking about all the potentials. What a freewheeling environment & one with a sly sense of humor. It's all about playing the players & the system falls out of the way. Win or lose, a joyous ride. I hope we keep playing it, wargaming has plenty of gravitas & grinding out edges; it's nice to loosen up & get creative & tell a great story.

RATING: 7
Interesting hybrid Euro-wargame with a novel take on deck-building mechanics, namely that you choose which cards you take into your hand for your next turn. I expected to like it much more than I did, unfortunately. I don't know what it was that rubbed me the wrong way, probably the downtime in a 4-player game or the fact that all your careful planning can go down the drain in between your turns because the situation on the board is too much fluid. Anyway, I can plainly see that it is a solid design, just not one for my taste.
UPDATE:after some plays it has grown on me. Rating bumped up by one point.

3rd century Roman Empire wargame with political attacks by competing factions to gain influence of the provinces and with Rome placing Governors, dispersing the mob, all while managing crisises most often from the surrounding barbarian groups.  Has a deck building component. A pretender empire is an unfamiliar concept to me.

Jak na pierwsze wrażenie: bardzo fajny tytuł. Dość prosty, trochę trącący mechanikami/sposobem robienia gry Martina Wallace'a. Pytanie jak regrywalność (myślę, że ze 3-4 razy to jeszcz na pewno chętnie przysiądę) oraz skalowalność na mniejszą ilość graczy. Czas gry: około 4h, mogłoby trwać trochę krócej (gra się *naprawdę* wolno rozkręca), choć jednocześnie mocno ograniczone możliwości na początku powodują, że początkujący nie powinien się czuć przytłoczony liczbą dostępnych opcji do wyboru.

Przez większość gry (od bodajże 2. do przedostatniej tury) zazwyczaj prowadziłem w punktacji po zakończeniu całej kolejki (choć np. Adam się wyłamał na chwilę gdzieś w 1/3 gry, dzięki udanie przeprowadzonej kampanii przeciwko Sassanidom), jednak w przedostatnim swoim ruchu Maks mnie wyprzedził i nie udało mi się tego nadrobić na ostatniej prostej.

Jeśli chodzi o rodzaj strategii w grze:
+ optymalizacja sposobu zagrania kart z ręki, tak, żeby natłuc jak największą ilość punktów dla siebie, zabezpieczyć swoje zdobycze - a jednocześnie możliwie zabrać punkty przeciwnikom, albo im utrudnić w ich kolejce (w pewien sposób klasyczne, złośliwe, "taktyczne", optymalizacyjne euro);
+ zarządzanie talią (coś jak Dominion, A Few Acres Of Snow itd.), gdzie dobór kart zależy od nas (nie jest losowy) więc trzeba planować w zasadzie najlepiej na 2 tury do przodu;
- ale jednocześnie w grze na 4 osoby po rozegraniu całej kolejki (ruchy kolejnych 3 graczy) może okazać się, że nasze plany są już mocno nieaktualne... więc dobrze, jeśli tak dobrałem karty, że mogę plan łatwo zmienić.
Nie znając wcześniej mechaniki gry - ale znając trochę jej realia - przystąpiłem do niej już z pewnym ogólnym planem, który przez większość czasu udawało się zrealizować.

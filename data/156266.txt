The theme and visuals of the game are great, but the gameplay's pretty bland.  While it's a fun enough game, it's pretty long and decently random - that said, it's satisfying in a way that most deckbuilders really aren't and true asymmetric races make things a good bit more exciting.

Rules are all over the place, though - I'm pretty sure we've played a lot of things wrong...

A very good solo deckbuilder, this will be my go-to game.

The artwork is stunning and there is a good variety of dinosaurs to play and hunt along with a good selection of bosses.

The multiplayer pvp rules however, seem very badly written and not well though out.  Our first 4 player game had 2 of us trying to figure out the pvp rules and not really getting anywhere.
I think we will be playing the next game with one boss and minions per player shuffled into the hunt deck and just tally up VP's at the end.
I hope the pvp rules will click as it really is looking like a great deckbuilder and the theme is awesome.

A lot of variety/replayability, and amazing artwork and theme. My first deck-builder.  Great for solo.

I think this is not a 10 for multiplayer with the rules as published, but I think a "multiplayer solitaire" type anti-boss variant I am working on, similar to the Exotic Predators multiplayer rules, might work just fine.

As part of my quest to reduce my game collection (and feel better about it) I am eliminating separate expansion listings for game expansions which don't actually take up room on the shelf.  Instead they will be listed in the main game entry.  If I sell a bunch of games and use the money to buy expansions which end up inside one game box, I don't want to see seven more listings here.

Expansions: Megalodon, Saurophaganax, Second Kickstarter Stretch Goal Pack, Stomping Grounds, Suchomimus, Therizinosaurus.  Print-and-play of booster pack for the two exotic predator species.

RATING: 1
Was a 5, now a 1 because the designer has disappeared without fulfilling PAID FOR booster/upgrade packs for anyone who was upgrading from the 1st edition.  2nd edition is unplayable without them if coming from 1st edition.  

DO NOT SUPPORT THIS DESIGNER. 

The game: Beautiful art and well integrated theme, but still suffers from some poor mechanical decisions like your primary means of deckbuilding, eggs, being tied to random availability, and a shoddy Battle Royale ending mechanism.  Great solo game though, and much improved by some multiplayer/solo combination variants.

After playing the heck out of this Game both in single- and multiplayer, I have come to the decision that Apex is one of the best Deck Building Games out there, though it feels a little rough around the edges, which may be because of some changes to the orginal gameplay, before it was final. Still... a lot of fun with beautiful artwork (though I really would have preferred tha hand-drawn style instead of cgi-graphics). 

BUT if there is one thing for sure, than it's that APEX is THE best dinosaur-themed game out right now and I'm hyped for the expansion which will be on kickstarter sometime this summer.

A solid, but fairly routine, deck-builder with the ambush mechanic being the one 'twist', although even then it's not a whole lot different from the 'Reserve' concept found in 'A Few Acres of Snow'. The main hook is the theme and the artwork although the latter is not quite as eye-popping as it looked like it would be from the KS campaign - not sure if that was due to the change from 2D to 3D creation or just the transfer from digital to cardboard.

Some stuff I marked it down on - 

- Lack of variety in the evolution deck.
- The time limit on each scenario limited the number of deck cycles so there's not much time to actually deck build.
- It seems quite luck based due to when the bosses appear and whether your ambushes spring or not.
- Needed to be more locations for variety.

The KS campaign that delivered the game was a bit of a train wreck but I have tried not to let that influence my rating - like I said, it's solid but uninspired game-play wise but if you like the dinosaurs and like deck-builders it may be for you. For me, I have several other deck-builders I preferred more so this went on the sale pile.

Apex is an amazing game. The theme  immerses you into a time when you are trying to become the dominant predator of the land. You will face pitfalls along the way and sometimes they do  devastate you for the most part you are able to come back from the brink. 
The lack of player interaction should be greatly corrected with the new expansions. I have introduced this to a variety of people with the exotic predators version and most everyone has loved it.
Most of the other people who have reviewed the game have it nailed down on the strengths and weaknesses of the game. 

I have to slightly change my review now as the game is a little different. The battle royal component doesn't live up to my expectations but my game group is working to modify the rules so that it will work better.
It is sad that HH got in over his head and was unable to fulfill on this promising game.

It's basically Pokemon in a box with dinosaurs. The artwork is truly fantastic. Truly. But it seems as though the game was designed around the artwork (not necessarily a bad thing; cf.

Played a friend's copy of the game, who bought it on a whim. The game is actually a pretty unique and thematic deck-builder. You take on the role of 1 of seven Apex carnivores and hunt down prey, evolve your cards to stronger cards and even hunt other players. 

i really like the aspect of having your own unique deck that you can buy from, that no one else can. One of my favorite mechanics in a deck builder, which barely makes it into modern DB games. Nightfall comes to mind, which has two stacks of cards unique per player. There is a "shared pool" of cards that everyone can buy from as well, known as Evolve, abilities that are simple drawing and deck-thinning. Herein lies one of the game's problems. There are just not enough cards, and/or variety in this stack. I wish there was more to choose from.  Thankfully, expansions for this game are quite cheap. Each adding a whole new Apex dinosaur deck to try out along with more Evolve cards, hunting ground cards, minions and bosses. That's always a plus.

There are a couple of other things that prevent this game from being great. Firstly is even with the newest rule set, Me and my friends ran into a few snags that hindered progress in what should be a pretty smooth experience. I mean it's a deck-builder after all. Too many times we had to look up a youtube video or read on a forum how certain things work. The rule book is well outlined but has some clarification issues. Maybe I'm just an idiot. 

Second, and this is my major gripe with the game, is the convoluted rules on how Alpha combat(PVP) and Battle Royale work.  Battle Royale is literally a mess. It just doesn't make sense and I understand the purpose of it, to have only one dinosaur victorious, but it will extend the crap out of your game. The game is long enough than it is(more on that later). Not to mention, this game has player elimination, if you hit an opponent at the right time. Thematic, yes, fun, not so much. I do not enjoy player elimination at all in game, unless the game plays in 10-30 minutes(Bang! The Dice Game, King of Tokyo etc.). In this game it will only make you frustrated. Rules for both of these aspects seem to finicky(gargantuan-ly speaking for Battle Royale), that after reading them over, I looked online to find a variant. Thankfully I found one that I implemented and I don't think the game suffered for it. Will probably only stick to this rule for any future plays from now on.

Playing time lists 60-240 minutes.... and in a deck builder, that's simply a no-no. Although I think this play time is for Solo play(60 minutes) and multiplayer games with the current PVP and Battle Royale rules. I would say the last three games I played clocked in at around 90 minutes. To me that's a little longer than I'm use to for a DBG. Xenoshyft and Legendary Encounters are great because they're the lengthiest, "perfect" length deck builders I've played, clocking in at 50-60 minutes, and Ascension and Shadowrun Crossfire being at the 30-45 minute mark. This game can drag, not even counting the setup time(which long, but not arduous) but with the variants it's definitely shortened. 

Overall I like the game, More cards will do it good to increase replayability and  variety. Cannot comment on the solo aspect, because I never tried it, but I hear it's really fun and adds a boss you need to tackle with to simulate a virtual opponent. With how the current rules state to do pvp and the final round of the game, I'm not a fan of it, but did enjoy with the variant rules instead. But even still, it's not a game I will clamor for if I need to fill a 90-120 minute session and it isn't my deck builder of choice, but Apex is a solid game that's definitely unique than many other offerings available with the same mechanic, that I won't mind playing every now and again.

Have to give this one credit for trying to break out of the typical competitive deck-builder mold, but the ambition behind this overshot the design by a Cretaceous mile. It is the fiddly kind of complicated--the worst kind of complicated.

Whereas most DBGs will crown the player who managed their deck most effectively as the winner 90% of the time, good luck with that here. I have never seen success so dependent on the draw. Culling your deck takes way too long and a lean deck is still no promise of success, especially when the freaking harsh environment cards can hose (or even eliminate) you, plus it can be a liability if you are playing with the full ruleset. Deck balance is questionable; quite a few combos are needlessly difficult to pull off.

Want to try it again, but am in no rush to do so.

I was originally in on this Kickstarter, but ended up dropping out when the announcement was made that they would be dropping the exceptional illustrations in favour of soulless (to my eyes) CG renders for the artwork. Given how the KS ended up, I probably shouldn't have regrets; but now that I've had a chance to play it, I really do wish I'd not turned my nose up at the change in art direction as Apex Theropod really is an exceptional solo game. You're given only a few rounds to grow your tribe before the boss shows up, and you need to put all those eggs you've hatched to good use. The game builds to an amazing crescendo, as you're put to the test against the boss - probably before you really feel ready to do so. As such, the final battle is tense as you struggle to build the attack necessary to inflict enough damage to allow the fight to continue. It's crushing when you fall short and exhilarating when you succeed. A real gem of a game.

Solitaire possible.

1st Kickstarter version with the special Exotic Predators exclusive card backs and 4 extra exclusive cards (Rexenator boss card and 2x minion card, plusFight for Dominence environment card.  

I'm NOT happy to find the the enclosed rulebook is a different version than the one that already shipped with the retail version.  And there is no available update sheet that lists the changes because the designer said there are too many changes to list them all. :(  And the downloadable updated rulebook would cost a lot to print, and it isn't even searchable!

The artwork was also changed from hand-drawn illustrations to 3D computer-generated images.  

Also, the extra guide book and artwork for my pledge (which I haven't received yet) will now be PDFs.

This game just keeps getting better and better as I play it more. It's very beautiful, the mechanics are clever and really evoke the theme; it's challenging but not impossible. With the wide variety of dinosaur species to play and a wide variety of bosses, you can play a long time before repeating anything. Caveat: I don't like the Battle Royale concept for multi-player. I always play with the bosses in the hunt deck.

Reminds me a bit of Legendary Encounters: Alien, which is a good thing.  It has the same addicting game play where you're trying to build up tempo with your deck while fighting various creatures.  

Feels very thematic to me.  The cards do exactly what you expect them to - you may gain affliction cards by going into battle with dinosaurs.  These cards will clog your hand and slow you down - sometimes triggering more bad things.  Egg cards trigger Apex cards to spawn for purchase.  You need to hunt dinosaurs to have the food needed as energy for procreating.  A lot of times, you'll need a pack of your dinosaurs to hunt together to take out bigger dinosaurs.  

My only complaint is the way bosses are handled.  It just feels a little off to me and seems a little too luck based.  They are shuffled into the hunt deck and you encounter them randomly.  Then, it'll take several rounds to beat them so you need to hope all of your hands keep coming up with enough hunt value to keep the battle going.  Although, this could just be my inexperience talking plus the type of bosses I have encountered.  It makes thematic sense in quite a few ways, but gameplay-wise I'm not a big fan.  Not enough to reduce my opinion of the game, though.

Fantastic game all around.  There were some changes made during the Kickstarter that made me a little sad when it was released.  The concept of player elimination was kind of solid, though I can understand why it was taken out of the game.

It's cumbersome a bit early on while learning how the game works out (a LOT of different decks to manipulate during setup and play), but after a couple games under my belt, it's been fairly smooth hunting.

Wow, that was disappointing. Just got done playing Apex for the first time (3p). I was super excited to finally get this game to the table. The description of this game checks a lot of boxes for me, and there were a lot of things that did work. However the end of the game ("Battle Royale") was a complete mess. It was unbalanced and pointless. I just could not feel more disappointed right now. The first part of the game was not amazing, but it was interesting and worked. The end, after reading the rules several times and checking FAQs online, is just nonfunctional. I feel like I should try playing it again with a COMPLETELY different ending, but after that last play through I don't think I even want to look at the game for a while.

This was a lot of fun, even if the rule book is a little long-winded and the cards needed to be sorted out in a way that was worse than a big box of Legendary. The game is extremely difficult though. You really have to know what you're doing to pull off a win, but I do like that the game gives you lots of opportunities to draw cards, eliminate cards, etc. At the same time, environment cards and other dinosaurs can really throw you for a loop, so you have to be okay with a decent amount of luck here. Also, the box is way bigger than it needed to be. I get that there are a lot of expansions floating around, but the cards in the base game don't even fill up half the box.

As for the game itself, I really enjoyed it. It sort of feels like a much faster version of the regular Legendary system. The difference here is that you choose a dinosaur to embody as you go after another apex predator. There are some neat ideas here, and while I think the amount of luck might ultimately cause me to drop my rating a bit, I found this game to be very enjoyable. Would like to try the multiplayer game soon to see if it's as fun as the solo version.

UPDATE: Multi-player version is alright, but the battle royale at the end is a little awkward. Not quite as much stress on the players. Being able to attack each other prior to the final battle seems a little unnecessary. Definitely seems like the designer couldn't figure out a good way to end the game, and wanted to avoid handing out points for having good cards in your deck. Seems like a missed opportunity to me.

Apex is a deck building game where you control your own species of dinosaur. Each Specie comes with its own deck, this deck is accessed by playing "hatch" cards which then allows you to gain them if you have enough carouses to feed your little ankle biters. You continue to hunt/hatch/feed until you reveal and defeat the boss Apex. Everything I stated above makes the game sound great, but in the end I wanted to like Apex so much more then I did. Each concept is fascinating but each round is bogged down by fiddly upkeep.

The only dino game I've played that  not only functions very well, but maintains the thematic element.

I'm still trying to figure out whether or not I like this game for the most part.  It's got a really good build up while you're playing the game and then the Boss encounters feel so "annoying".  That's the best feeling I would describe it.  It's like there's this weird mini-game where everything you used to do goes out the window and you need to combo as much damage as possible.

If the Boss is immune to a certain affliction type and you just keep drawing it you're just SOL.

I was a Kickstarter backer. The artwork was half of my reason for backing. Unfortunately he changed the artwork after the campaign ended and what we ended up with is not nearly as good. The post campaign was horrendous and that plays into my opinion of the game. I like deck builders and this game is fun, but I'm still sour after the bs post Kickstarter.

The game's best with 2-3 people and It's kinda broken with 4 or more. 
This deck-building game's definitely not for everyone.
The coolest deal about this game is it has a out-standing design.

1) the rulebook is a mess.  When you don't find out how to take a turn until page 25, you know something is up.  A few obvious points are belabored over and over, while critical novelties of the game are mentioned in passing in an obscure passage.  It's long and badly written.
2) the game itself is extremely random if you play with the environment deck.  The rest of the game is actually pretty interesting -- the double economy of carcasses and genes interact in an interesting way, and I like how hatching cards from your personal deck gives you controlled exposure to your character-specific cards.
3) Played multi-player, the scoring rules and semi-cooperative nature of the bosses just doesn't work.  As a solo game, it's solid.
4) The theme is well researched, well presented, and well integrated.
5) Overall, the game is close to awesome, but currently it's not worth the pain of figuring out the rules just to play a mildly interesting and fairly random deck builder.

note: comments based on first kickstarter edition.  maybe the 2nd version will be different.

as a solo game: 6/10
as a multi-player game: 4/10
the rulebook: 2/10

RATING: 6
this (20 plays logged) would be my favorite solitaire game over even Imperial Settlers (22 plays logged), except that i bought into the second edition kickstarter upgrade, mixed in the new cards, and just hated the new rules. part of my problem is that i'm missing an upgrade deck that might adjust the balance to work with these changes. so i was playing with only half the game? maybe, but even with the upgrade conversion pack i'm not sure i like the direction of the new edition. anyway, it doesn't much matter since i'm annoyed enough that i haven't bothered to attempt sorting the decks to play the first edition again. i had fun, but it's actually a pretty swingy game and multiplayer was always a slow mess (although anyone might expect that with five players). basically, it comes down to the fact that i've got a pile of other games --complete games!-- that i like more. anyway, i'm pretty tired of deckbuilders on the whole. still, maybe one day the designer will reappear and make good on the ks so i can feel complete... before i sell it off.

[BGCOLOR=#000000][COLOR=#FFFFFF]SoloX.[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] Nice DBG with terrific graphic design. It uses a 2-resource system with dynamic markets, but the way each player's species has its own growth deck and the way the cards flow in the game is well done and, for me, fits itself strongly to the theme.

My 11yo son loved it, so I foresee getting good mileage out of this.

No one I`ve taught the game to has liked it... 

1. For starters, the rulebook is atrocious. It took me forever to find out how boss fights work because the rules for them were split up between three separate places in the rulebook. And once I did figure them out I don`t really think that they add anything fun to the game... we ended up just giving a points bonus to the player that killed the boss and then counting up points at the end.  

2. It seems like the designer was a big fan of Marvel Legendary and decided to make something similar but with a bunch of extra *stuff* thrown in, whether it works well or not.The level of random player screwage is quite high, which works in a semi-cooperative game like Legendary but is very frustrating in a strictly competitive game like this one. The screwage is in fact probably higher than it is in Legendary, even - when you take a wound, for instance, you don't just take a wound card, you draw from the wound deck - maybe it's a normal wound, maybe it's a super-wound that will give you more wounds every time you draw it.

3. Lack of variety in the evolution deck bothers me a bit, though this is a less serious concern than the others...

**Thinking about trading.  Will part for the right offer**

Played only solo.  This is a solid solo deckbuilder.  It's you against the boss for the title of Apex Dinosaur.  The game plays very quick.  In a way, it almost plays itself.  The choices are not very interesting and mostly obvious.  In the end I feel luck plays a bigger role than strategy.

There are a ton of cool and innovative mechanics in Apex. It's a little complicated as far as deck-builders go, with multiple decks to juggle and markets to manage, but once you get the hang of it there are some very cool interactions that take place. This is a game about the competition between Apex predators and the game allows you to explore that to its fullest. You can just work on hunting prey and keeping future generations fed, or you can aggressively try to ambush your opponents and knock them off their plan A.

My favorite interactions are among the cards that make up the game trail. There are predators in that deck, and these actively hunt other dinos on the trail, effectively creating even more competition, as food becomes scarce.

My only real complaint is the final stage, the "Battle Royale". While in-game battles are tense and exciting, this new tie-breaker round is anything but. Both players strip their deck, cherry pick their favorite units, then deploy them across from one another. The result is largely based on luck, which is quite unsatisfying in the scheme of things.

I'm hoping someone figures out a new and balanced system for pitting the decks against each other after Winter comes.

As was its kickstarter destiny, some cards just don't make sense due to improper testing and editing. Hence the reason why the Game Description in the BGG database holds the all-time length record - to make up for other shortcomings.

We tried the intro scenario, but the endgame was sufficiently nonsensical that it needs a second attempt (with FAQ in hand) to ensure proper play.  I would prefer for fossil remains to be nearby to put me in the mood.

Note: I'm glad I played someone else's copy and didn't fork out the cash myself. The rules are a train wreck.

This is a really fun game, but it can be a bit complicated at first. It is similar to Thunder Stone in that you go to “hunt” a variety of opponents. I think that the twists on the game, such as environmental events, make it quite interesting and refreshing from other deck building games. The only problem is that the manual is very confusing, and I had to watch a video on how to play before I got the concepts of it.

Apex 2.0 has finally (more or less) addressed the issues that plagued the initial print (Exotic Predators) - an atrocious rule book and a broken Ambush mechanic that didn't scale with higher difficulty levels.

Apex is back with a vengeance, and it's better than ever.  The card pool is finally large enough to customize each Apex deck to your preferred play style.  Replayability is through the roof with the introduction of even more evolves, apex predators, afflictions, and bosses (through expansions).  

NOTE: This is a game best enjoyed solo.  PvP is lackluster, feels like an entirely different game-wthin-a-game, and introduces player elimination.  That said, I would not hesitate to play multiplayer using this well thought out variant of the 1st edition multiplayer rules: https://boardgamegeek.com/article/22488168#22488168

Absolutely in love with this 2nd edition.  This one will stay out for days at a time.

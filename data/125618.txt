I like this game, and yet we haven't played it in almost a year, and I'm ok with that. :/

UPDATE: 8-12-14: Make that over a year without a play. The wife mentioned the other day, as we are running out of space on our gaming shelf, that she wouldn't mind booting Libertalia to make room for other games. Sorry Lib, it's not you, it's us.

** Traded for Suburbia in 2014 BGG.Con Math Trade **

Update: 7-13-15: I had an opportunity to play this recently and was actually really excited to try it again after a 2 year hiatus. Though no fault at all of the other players, that will be the last time I ever play this game. For so much "take that", there is no reason this should take 90-120 minutes to play. Very unenjoyable (for me). If this ended after the first "week" of play (30-45 minutes) my rating would be very different, but blech, I can't play this again.

Enjoyable light-medium role-selection game. The system of drawing roles from a deck means each game will play differently, and the roles are nicely designed to combo with each other effectively. The game looks nice, with great components. It's an enjoyable, fairly random game, with a nice level of player interaction. Conflict is present, but it never feels mean-spirited.

8 plays, with 5,6 players.

LIKE: the mechanism of trying to guess what your opponents play when the treasures come up. the game makes more sense when described as a "bad things always happen" game, which works with pirate theme.
DISLIKE: A mean game. The game can swing a lot, and players gang up occasionally. Can be frustrating for some.

OVERALL: I like the game. upped my rating, but only with 5-6 players. 3-4 players, probably not as high, but haven't tried it with lower than 5.

RATING: 6
The crux of Libertalia is predicting what the other players will play with each character selection.  There's not much more to it other than that.  Libertalia can be fun, but is too long for what it is.  The game involves three rounds, with each round consisting of six days (character selections).  I would prefer it if the game were only two rounds.  By the start of the third round, I'm usually ready to move on to another game.

As a component note, the game box is much bigger than it needs to be for the components that come with the game.  I'm not sure if this is because the publisher plans for expansions or if it was just cheaper to go with a standard-sized box.  The $50 MSRP seems high for what you get with the game.

+Enjoyable gameplay where success is determined by how well you can predict which cards your opponents will play.
+Skill does seem to matter, though luck can be a big factor.
+Nice artwork.

-Game takes too long for the depth it provides.
-Theme is pasted on.
-Setup is a bit cumbersome.
-Overpriced at $50 MSRP.

I was suprised how much I liked Libertalia. I am normally not really into games which require a lot of memorizing but Libertalia plays fast, simple and fun.
In fact there is quite a bit of analyzing people and judge how they will play out this turn and this will often lead to a certain luck factor. But this luck/bad luck doesnt make you feel bad or go mad at the game but leads to laughters and fun.
For its short playing time and the fact that it will play well with 3-6 players it is a perfect game to play in a short time period.
Of course if you play with people which tend to analyze/paralyze this game might get quite a lot of downtime for you.

+ Interesting role selections each round; Mixes planning, outguessing, and luck into a quick-playing game.
- Lots and lots of reading little text.


Why it's previously-owned:
In the end, after several plays, it was pretty forgettable.  It was fun, sure, but there are other games that are fun, compelling, and make people want to play it again as soon as they're done.
This got traded with others for Goa, High Frontier, and Jambo.

RATING: 7
A good combination of easy rules, interaction and strategy with enough luck to not make it chess. It also has great features of my favorite game, Poker. Having to predict or anticipate what your opponents would do and the he knows that I know factor of such games to me is most intriguing. The pirate theme also comes up greatly and is so fun to roleplay.  
Downside is it can be mean but nowhere as mean as most games like Spartacus for example and one can have analysis paralysis if they are not familiar with the cards and wish to read and analyze all the cards in detail. 
Overall, a great game and I am most happy I have played it.

Note based on first play, I liked this game very much, I don't know if it is because of being one of the first (if not the first) games I play with the pirate theme. I had a lot of fun playing and the playtime in 5 players seems very satisfying.

I played Sultan and this game in the same day, there is no way of comparrison but one of the similarity is that in both you make some kind of a blind bid, but the difference is that the blind bid you make in Libertalia is equal (or almost but it counts as strategy) in powers between players, and of course the treasures you catch is the only thing that depends on this blind bid, the rest is up to the cards powers.

The theme doesn't interest me, the rules of this light card-game seemed fairly uninspiring: I couldn't understand what all the fuss was about Libertalia. Then, I played it: and now I LOVE this game! One of the best role-selection games out there, and it certainly buries Citadels, with which it's often compared.
It's definitely well-themed in the sense of the art and the flavour-text, but it is not immersively thematic. If you want a game dripping with pure pirate theme, then you're looking for Merchants & Marauders.
Libertalia is a lot more cut-throat than M&M, though!

Pros
- Simultaneous action selection!
- See loot beforehand so you have some kind of strategy
- Everybody gets their own deck
- Everybody gets the same cards
- Great coins, cards, and board. Very Pirate-ty

Cons
- Killing the person to your left doesn't make sense thematically with a sword token
- Tiebreaker system seems incredibly flawed, how do you account for that? 
- Pirate theme doesn't shine through

Sold/Traded because: 
- Theme seemed tacked on
- The tiebreaker system doesn't make sense 
- Hard to grasp a good strategy with the tiebreaker system 
- Not as exciting as it should be

Shiver me timbers, a pirate-themed game that isn't rubbish!  Libertalia offers simultaneous role selection, with each player starting out with an identical set of roles.  Gradually, as the game progresses, those sets diverge.  The thirty character cards in each player deck offer a decent and thematic range of special powers with synergies between different characters possible.  Thought is required, about the order in which to play your roles, about the best one for this turn, and about the likely picks of your opponents.  There's a degree of chaos that rises with the number of players.  I probably wouldn't play with more than four.  Libertalia plays quickly and smoothly and doesn't outstay its welcome.

The artwork is really rather nice and production quality is good.  The rules are well written and appear complete.  The card text is generally unambiguous; our only query was about which booty tiles the Preacher discards.

Not bad if played quickly.  A simultaneous blind role selection/card effects game that is fairly interesting to think about if you can wrap your mind around the reasonably straightforward card effects and how they might interact with each other.

Plenty of strategic depth with second guessing and trying to outsmart your opponents. The game is all about timing the cards you play so that you get the best loot, create character ability combos, and factor in what your opponents are going to play.

This is a great gateway game in my opinion.  Not too heavy for new players but it is best played with the 4-6 player count.  Starting hand consists of 9 cards randomly drawn from a deck and everyone has the same cards.  Played over three "weeks" and week two and three six more cards are added to your hand.  Object is to use your cards effectively to end the game with the most victory points by use of money and booty tiles that you collect.  Yes, it is pirate themed.  Great game.

An excellent game, the best of Paolo Mori, and stands alongside Merchants & Marauders as the best pirate game I own, plus much easier to introduce to new players. You draw hands of identical pirate ranks, each with their own abilities, and play them out to gain loot. Different characters use abilities in different phases, and there are increasing and decreasing rank orders. Excellent artwork, plenty of variation, loads of fun.

When I first played this game, I thought it would be one of my top games; it was mechanically simple but quite deep. And much of the depth laid with the tie-breaking mechanism, which eliminated randomness and gave players useful information to work with (if they remember how ties are broken, which isn't difficult). 

But, after numerous plays, you realize that the decks aren't balanced despite each deck breaking the same number of ties; this is because certain cards are much more powerful than others. As a consequence, this game suffers from the worst type of randomness of all... the type of randomness that gives a player a distinct advantage/disadvantage before the game ever starts.

There has been some variants proposed that reduce/eliminated the tie-breaking mechanism... but that mechanism is what made the game feel so much richer and replacing it, with silly randomness, adds nothing to the experience. 

As much as I want to love this game... it's flawed for competitive gamers.

An amazing game that I think everyone should own. I bought this a while back and my group enjoy it so much that they even ask if we can play it without me prompting.

The one thing I will say is that the artwork, whilst good, is blatantly using images of celebs as reference. You can see Ian Mckellan's Gandalf redrawn to look like a pirate and even an image of Elisha Cuthbert (From "The girl next door" I believe) has been redrawn to look like a waitress.

After first play I was charmed by this game, but with each next game my enthusiasm dropped lower and lower. The tiebreaker system is a bit off for me, I'm sure those tiebreaker-numbers are spread more or less evenly among the colors but the problem is you will get cards randomly and you may simply not get even distribution. I would like to see a different way of resolving ties.

I, like many other board gamers, have come to the conclusion that there is no perfect pirate game.  However, if you combine all of them, they create the perfect experience.  When it comes to Libertalia, this feels very much like a more controlled "Cash 'n Guns" of the pirate world.  It's after the raid on the ship and time to split up the booty and depending on the rank of your character, is what booty you get.

The great thing about this game is the way in which people can play the cards.  While everyone starts out with the same hand, the game can morph into one of the more diabolical experiences I have had in gaming.  

Libertalia is one of the more hidden gems of the industry and I highly recommend it to everyone.

A light short, fun family game that support many players. Main strategical choice is in which order to play your hand. I think with some extra choices it could be even deeper, although the characters all seem useful and well playtested.

Libertalia is both a great gateway game for non-gamers, and a great filler for gamers!
The main mechanic is simultaneous role selection: so there is bluffing, mind reading and... a lot of laughter!
The game is pretty simple and can be taught in 10 minutes, it someway rewards planning and clever play, BUT is very enjoyable even if you play in a mindless way and just throw cards on the boat to see what happens...
Thumbs up for the production value: the game is pretty abstract and could've been themed about commerce, finance or any other money gathering entreprise, but the magnificent artworks helps entering into a pirate world (and the components are top notch quality)!

A really nice pirate themed strategy game. We messed up when we played the first game in that we didn't realize you didn't have to have the booty tiles face up on the ship for all the days. 

It might have been a little more random if we didn't know how to string certain characters together to make sure we were going to get specific tiles. Overally a very fun game.

This is a very tactical, simultaneous, action selection game. A little heavier than a gateway game. The fun is discovering the synergy between various cards. I find a lot of joy in card games that feature "combos" when certain cards come together. I think it is better at the higher player counts. I love how everyone starts off the same, but from there on, the cards that they have in hand varies as players use them at different times. The art is top notch as it looks almost real.

After one play with six, I'm less impressed than I was hoping to be.  While it shares role selection with the inevitably-compared Citadels, I was expecting something that might make me no longer want to play Faidutti's excellent game.  They definitely do not give me the same feel.  There is a streamlined elegance to Citadels that is missing among the 30 roles in Libertalia.

Nevertheless I expect to enjoy this more as I come to know the cards.  It's unfortunate that there are many clarifications required for the card text, some of which are still being house-ruled due to lack of attention from the publisher.  The official faq, only available in Italian, leaves several obviously confusing cards unexplained, such as the Priest and Topman.

News of Citadels' death has been greatly exaggerated.

RATING: 7
Libertalia is a pirate-themed role-selection game that will appeal to fans of Citadels and Mission Red Planet.  Each day of the campaign, players simultaneously select character cards from their hand.  All characters are placed in order of their rank, and take role-specific actions during dawn or dusk.  Character rank ultimately dictates if / when their actions take effect, as well as if / when the character can return to the ship with booty.  Other characters have specific actions that don't take effect until night time and at the end of the 6-day campaign.  Points are earned for all wealth acquired within a given campaign, and totaled among the 3 different campaigns to determine the lone winner.  Players will begin the 1st campaign with the same 9 randomly-selected role cards, but will independently decide which 6 roles to play during the campaign.  All players will receive the same 6 randomly-selected role cards at the start of both the 2nd and 3rd campaigns, but the 3 role cards that carry over from the previous campaign will likely differ more and more as the game progresses.  This requires each player to continue to try to anticipate and preempt the play of certain role cards by each of their opponents from one campaign to the next.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The pirate theme is a bit thin, but the game itself, which is all about hand management and bluffing, is simple to understand and loads of fun. Each player starts with the same cards to work with, so with everyone using the same resouces, the trick is to use the right cards at the right time, and to save some good cards for later rounds. It's clever, quick and good fun.

RATING: 8
I didn’t expect Libertalia could be half this good: yet I found it’s a solid game whose take on deck building also capitalizes on its pirates theme. I’m not saying it’s dripping with it but it’s thematic enough to shine among a plethora of similar games whose themes are simply pasted on: while playing Libertalia, you can even feel it now and then!

Sadly the game is lacking in customization though: it would have been nice if each pirate had a different single-use special ability or if the deck had a card or two whose properties were different from each one. Not only would that add to the fun and to the strategy but it would also make the game thematic a little further.

Anyway, Libertalia is fun: outguessing your opponents takes center stage and risk-seeking is pivotal to get the best-prized booties.[i](October 2015)[/i]

[b]Update[/b] - Recently I’ve been playing Libertalia again often and this led me to notice how much this game appeals to me: it’s a successful blend of planning, hand management and randomness, the first two being a little prevalent maybe but not so much overwhelming to strangle the fun the latter ensures.

Actually there’s plenty of interaction between players in Libertalia and messing with their actions: hence, in October 2017 I raised my rating from 7 to 8.

This is the ultimate role selection game.  If you dig games like Citadels, or Mission: Red Planet then you owe it to yourself to track down this game.  The pirate theme works, the goal is simple (MOST MONEY!) and you're constantly trying to outguess your opponents.  For a pirate game it has plenty of teeth so be prepared to screw over your neighbor.

Most other months this probably would have been the top choice. The decision of what card to play has a number of factors which make each round interesting. You’re trying to figure out an overall strategy of how to make the cards in your hand work together, so you want to consider the special power of the card you want to play. But you also need to consider the value of that card and what booty tokens are available. Not to mention what your opponents might play which you have some idea of since you all started with the same cards. I played a three and five-player game and definitely preferred it with three. The more players, the more chaotic which might be the one knock against the game. I still really enjoyed it.

// I like this game quite a bit. It probably could replace
Citadels for us because it has a similar feeling to 
selecting a role that interacts with the other players,
but it does it in a way where you have more options and
it's typically not so harsh. I'd like to play this game
more often, but it's stronger at higher player counts 
while we play most games with 2 players.

Everyone having the same cards to start is cool because it gives the game a little bit more of a controlled feel.  Lots of planning and guessing what your opponents will play.  In the subsequent rounds it becomes a little harder to tell what will come out because opponents kept different cards.  A little chaotic, which I like, and opponents will definitely mess with your plans.  Not too much "take that" though.  Great balance between having a strategy for the whole round while staying adaptable when things don't go to plan.  Great theme and production.  Scales well and plays fast even with higher player counts with basically no downtime.

OK game of role selection and 'trick taking'(?). Not a terrible game but no instant desire to play again. Could get deeper on repeated plays, but Libertalia features no 'buildup' of any kind of engine, and a lot of the card powers seemed uninteresting or underwhelming. I prefer games where you either have to agonize over several attractive choices, sacrifice short-term gain for long-term gain (engine build-up), or at least plan carefully to avoid destruction. Libertalia offered none of these. Instead, it seemed to give me a bunch of mediocre choices each turn that neither paid off handsomely nor lead to ruin.

The perfect game for every "Talk-like-a-pirate-day" or Pirate/Bucaneer-themed party.

With more players it becomes harder to remember the cards of your opponents and more chaos enters the game.

I like the mechanics behind the game.
Playing a smaller card gives you benefits since you can use your power earlier but makes you choose your treasure later what can lead to some bad stuff.
Otherwise you can play a higher card to secure the treasure but maybe your crew member isn't in play anymore due to the power of another played card.


Great game.

I held off on this for several months and recently got it in an impulse buy. I'm so glad I did! It's incredibly simple, playing just like a Faidutti role selection game (e.g. Citadels, Mission Red Planet), but the choices are much more interesting because of the order in which special powers and treasure selection are resolved.

The fact that you can see what is offered in all six turns makes your decisions even more tough. Should you fight to take a good treasure, or deliberately try to avoid taking a bad one? Do you want to kill one of your opponent's characters, or kill off one of your own men instead? (there are reasons why you might want to do this). It's fun trying to guess what other players are going to play, trying to predict the order of events, calculating what will pay off best at the end of the round, or deciding which cards to play now and which to save for later. Lots of good stuff here.

Brilliant game that makes every strategic play feel underhanded (as a pirate game probably should). For some reason, this reminded me of a trick-taking card game.

RATING: 8.5
I really enjoyed this game because it took some of the best parts of Citadels and added a cool theme and some extra mechanics that made it into this outstanding game. I absolutely need to buy this game, as well as get Citadels to the table more!  There were times I KNEW what I should play, and changed my mind because of all the second guessing myself and what I think others were going to do. You know it's a great game when you lose that badly but instantly want to come back for more more more!!!

It feels like a complicated (and longer) 6 nimmt! With all the special powers I feel like I need to put more thought into my turns, but I don't get the impression that the extra thought is worth it considering the general chaos when the cards are flipped (the tie breaker method in particular is responsible for a lot of the general chaos).

However, the game gets compared most often to Citadels, and it is definitely a simpler (and quicker) Citadels. But then again, I detest Citadels...

RATING: 8
Nice simultaneous card play game. Since everyone is playing the same subset of the same deck, there is no luck. That doesn't mean there is a ton of control, as the chaos level is very high. But it's fun trying to outguess the other players. Not too many interesting decisions, but the superfiller length feels right with the weight. 

Played again recently and delightful. Very tense and fun. It is chaotic but is not that long and curiously one of the few games where card text doesn't bother me at all.

  Just introdused this to my more casual gaming group went over very well!  Will be glad to bring this to regular game nights as this is a spectacular game.  While i enjoy citadels with LOW player count it's almost interminalble with 5 or more.

  Libertalia is very enjoyable with any player count.  We had someone arrive late so one player gave up his second month and the new player was very easily able to pick up the game and get into the game easily.

  I really recommend this game for people who enjoy role selection and limited luck in their games, but also those who enjoy a mean game which this will innevitably will occur as people will point out hey you should stab his gambler as he will get 8 gold this round, while my witch only gets me 2!!

  Very very fun game

RATING: 9
Rated 8 after one play. I think I read somewhere that this is the better Citadels, and I can kinda agree with that assessment. But, this is not a gateway game like Citadels! This is more of a "next tier" sort of game, as the dizzying array of choices with the various character powers and  their interactions will overwhelm the casual gamer.

I really like the fact that, on your turn, you play a card. But that card serves two purposes: it's a bid for selecting the "booty tiles," and it's also a unique power that you need to maximize. The game does really boil down to how well you can assess your starting hand, much like the way Dominion players analyze those starting kingdom cards. The difference is that the game resets two more times and each phase requires that analysis. 

It's only been one play, so I hesitate to make too many assertions, but I really enjoyed this with three players and look forward to more plays. Bidding and character powers in a 45 minute game? Sign me up.

Six plays now, and I enjoy this even more. Great filler for gamers that provides a lot of replay as players try to navigate the interactions between the role cards. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A card game all about playing role cards to take an action to try and gain VP. Having 30 cards and only seeing 18 does add to the variety in the game, but when most of them are all gain or lose some number of doubloons it loses some of the luster of having so many cards. I'd rather the roles be more exciting and there be more to it than just collecting booty tiles. It's chaotic and fun, but at the same time the round structure with the cards and booty tiles is a little too fiddly for my tastes.

The game consists of choosing a role, then executing the abilities. The theme is pirates, but I would have preferred old west. The game fills the same niche as Citadels, but the end game is fixed at a number of rounds so players can plan a bit more in this than in the other. After the game the consensus was that we enjoyed more than Citadels, but not enough to run the Zeeland today and buy it. Vann pointed out that kingmaking may be a problem with this as in the other, but as it lasts less than an hour I don't mind.

First impressions rating: 6.5. I was a bit let down by this one compared to the hype it gets in some of my circles. I love Ethnos, and I love the mechanics in games like this (I kinda lump it in with Mission Red Planet, Citadels, Broom Service, and Bloodborne, but as of now I prefer all of those). The gameplay just fell a little flat for me. I'll definitely play it again; I didn't hate it or anything. It has room to go up with subsequent plays. Might just be the players/count or cards we got (no Granny Wata!) in that session. Time will tell.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.3
This card game seems quite simple on the surface - play a card, highest gets first pick of the loot for the day.  But it's the interplay of the actions on those cards (as well as some negative booty) that complicates matters.

Libertalia is relatively easy to teach and I like the idea that all players are starting with the same cards so you can figure out how to outwit each other.  But this game can also grind to a halt as the AP-prone agonize over which card to choose knowing that most of them have to hit the table at some point.

While not a huge favorite, this game is unique enough that I'm sure we'll keep playing it, especially because it can go really quickly with some (non-AP-prone) players.  Fair warning - the 2-player game doesn't really work well.

RATING: 6
Components: Great-looking character artwork and player mats. Clear-enough booty tokens.

Experience: Super chaotic. Without knowing which characters will be available in later rounds, or which characters a player is playing in a particular round, it feels pretty random whether I get the booty token I want or not, and whether I get to effectively use my character or not. Our first game was rife with people shooting themselves in the foot, using their own character at inopportune times.

This game is OK, but I don't really enjoy it very much.  While luck is not really the factor, anticipated the other player actions is difficult, and the random situation that results can be frustrating.  For example, in the second turn, 3 people played the same card while I had the highest, causing me to have to pay each of them 3 coins.  While *maybe* I could have anticipated it, it sucked that it was a detriment to my score so early in the game.

This game is both light and yet strategic and fairly deep. The art is solid, the components are solid, the gameplay is fun. Lots of options during play for strategy. Game can be lighter or very brain burning if you try and out-think all your opponents, predict their play, and maximize your scoring potential. The game has a huge amount of replayability as well since there are 30 roles, and only around half will be seen each game in a different combination each time, with different loot coming out each time...

I thought Libertalia would be a perfect game for me, and in many ways it is. I love the theme, and I'm a huge fan of just about any game with a simultaneous selection mechanic. But I would pretty much only play this game with just my main gaming group and it's already owned by someone else. This is the game that has made me realize I'd like to be able to play my games amongst as many different groups as possible (within reason) and at first blush, Libertalia seems like it can do that...but the thought of trying to teach Libertalia to my family or non-gamers gives me a headache.

The second guessing and card counting aren't that interesting and with a larger player count, it often feels random especially with the tie breakers.

Libertalia is een piratenspel waarbij je kaarten moet spelen. De kaarten hebben allemaal speciale eigenschappen en de rangorde op de kaarten bepaalt welke speler eerst een schat mag nemen. Leuk kaartspel, maar niet leuk genoeg om het aan te schaffen. Al denk ik dat de spelersinteractie in een real-time-spel beter tot zijn recht komt dan in een online spel.

It drops ever so slightly in my rankings ... still enjoy it a lot, it's just that some other games are moving up.

[September 2014 - 8.7]
It's game where the more you play, the more you discover the card interactions and potential domino effects, depending on the order they're played. I love the fact that a single card can yield so many different results. One game, you play card X and "yay, what a perfect play. Gee, I'll play that again in the next game," and then, bam, because another player played card y, card x is now a horrible card to play. Or flip side, you might think you're doomed with one card, but because of the others played that turn, it's golden. That swing of emotions and double-guessing what your opponents will play is a lot of fun. It all makes for a different game each time where you're seeing new chains. Definitely play with more than two players to get that full scope. Perhaps most impressive, you wouldn't expect this variability from a game where everyone essentially is playing from the same hand of cards.

Perhaps the best player doesn't always win, but careful planning and strategy is needed to give yourself a chance.

Fun 'take that' game.  You spend a lot of time reading cards, so this one gets more fun the more you play.  It's also got that Iocane Powder game thing going from The Princess Bride where you start to play mind games around what the other people will do.  A good light game.

The level of chaos is just a bit higher than the game length warrants.  And I do think there is a tiny bit of the perception of control, if not actual control.  But I'd just as soon play 6 Nimmt, which has the right amount of chaos and game length.

Interesting role selection game - can be fun and frustrating, depending on how you find the double-guessing of what everyone else does.

Only played once but it's possible the game may run a bit too long for what it is. Second play and I think play length will only be a problem on first play and with the terminally AP.

Bello anche questo. Dato che è un po' causale (simile al bridge nel ricordare le carte, ma più difficile per via delle varia manche) forse non ci giocherei molte volte di seguito che rischia di diventar ripetitivo, ma una volta ogni tanto è ottimo.

Libertalia: in 4 giocatori vado a vincere. A me e alla mia collega continua a divertire. A uno degli amici che l'hanno provato è piaciuto, all'altro no, lamentava il fatto che il colore nero è troppo scarso. 
Ho voluto poi provarlo in due giocatori per vedere come gira e mi è piaciuto molto.

The pirate theme works okay in this game, which makes a nice alternative to Citadels.   I like that there are 30 roles.  Some abilities trigger in ascending order, some in descending, some at the end of each turn, and some at the end of the entire round.   You can do some second-guessing of what people might play, but really the game is highly random.   If played quickly, it will be 45-60 minutes, so I’m not too bothered by that.   Each of the three weeks is a total reset, so you definitely can come from behind to win.   Not sure if it is a game with staying-power, but I’d play it a few more times for sure.

The success of a game of Libertalia boils down to the the third and final round. In a good game, you'll have discussion and taunts around the table - has anyone still not used that powerful effect from the first round? Wasn't there an effect earlier that would be really powerful now?

I feel like the fun of Libertalia could burn out with enough plays, but for now it's still sitting high on my lists.

RATING: 4
A simultaneous role-selection game with an abundance of 'take-that' factors, the game focuses more on the need to find ways to screw your opponents rather than really building up any strategy of your own.   

Generally for games, the more random/lucky the game is, the shorter it should be and the longer the game, the more strategic it should be.  Here you have seven phases over three rounds which felt way too long for this kind of luck-based chaotic game.   After seven phases, I was ready for it to end, but I basically had to play the exact same game again, two more times!    

Additionally, while many compare this to Citadels (which has 8 to 9 well-crafted characters to choose from), here there are 30 potential character cards many with questionable abilities that are not so equally balanced between their rank and ability.  We often had situations where everyone played the exact same character card because it was so overly powerful and the person who didn't basically got screwed.  With so many character cards to choose from you also run into the Analysis Paralysis problem, which just slows the game down more.  

If this game had only seven turns, and the characters abilities were better refined, crafted and balanced, the game might be enjoyable as a 20 minute laugh and a filler, but as it is, it just drags on for way too long.

UPDATE:  After a few years since my initial play, I replayed this game again and am dropping my score from 6 to 4.  I really felt this game is just a case of ‘play a card and see what happens.’  Again, I feel this game lasts WAY to long for what it is; I completely tuned out after a few rounds and was ready for it to be over.  It is just so random and chaotic.  As far as any story or theme, there is NONE of that here.  It really is just ‘play a card and see what happens.’

Divertido juego apto tanto para jugones como para la familia, sencillamente la interacción entre las cartas es altísima y eso lo hace un juego con mucho, pero mucho puteo lo cual a mi me encanta, ademas el echo de que todos jueguen con las mismas cartas evitan que el llorón de turno se excuse diciendo que perdió por tener peores cartas, se necesita saber elegir bien los combos que vas a utilizar, saber como jugaran y pensaran los demás y aun así es posible que puteen y te carguen todo tu plan, grandisimo juego, como pega esta mega-sobreproducido y podría ser mucho mas barato aunque probablemente si fuera un simple juego de cartas no seria tan atractivo para la familia.

The more I play Libertalia, the more I can appreciate the elegance of the design. There is a definite risk of overthinking every move, but at some point you have to realize that people are going to play cards that will screw up your careful planning. The limited chaos is excellent, and the upset when your winning card isn't, is fantastic. Definitely recommend, and unlike most games that can play 6, I would recommend this with the maximum player count.

Great game that gets more interesting as it goes on.  At first, everyone has the same cards, but come round 3, unless you've been paying very close attention to everyone at the table, you're going to be guessing a lot at what the other guys are going to play.

While some of the card powers are annoying, the fact that everyone has access to the same ones makes it very interesting.  At one point in our game, we had 5 beggars played against a single player.  That poor bastard.

Cutthroat, Medium

One of the meanest and most fun games I own.  Very novel mechanic and despite just being a card game, it is very thematic to boot.  You gotta play pretty mean in this game, especially at lower player counts, haven't had an issue with runaway winners but I can see a situation work out that way.  It's got a reasonable length, and a very deep strategy, also lots of bluffing and a bit of diplomacy, just a great game in general.

This is a good simultaneous action selection game.  Everyone receiving the same cards is awesome, and seeing how playing them in a different order can vastly change things is cool.  There's the right amount of guessing what other people are going to play versus chaos.  Every play has interesting choices.

RATING: 7
This looks like the best card to play, but everyone else is probably thinking that too, so in that case this is probably the best card, but you know someone else is probably going to select this card, and if everyone thinks the best card is too obvious then no one is probably going to play it, so maybe I should play it, but I kind of really want to screw over the person who plays this card over here, so maybe I'll select this other card I've been hanging onto.  Great stuff.

Again, characters with special powers.

I can understand why many people have rated this game highly, but for me there are too many superfluous bits added to what is essentially a blind guessing game. I am not a huge fan of this game mechanic since your best efforts can end in crippling results  from random flip of a coin. The added "deck building" aspect and varied discard piles only add to the upkeep. The artwork and theme are fine, though the player boards and scoreboard are needlessly large and awkward, while the area on the main board to hold booty tiles is too small.

I am glad I tried it and would not begrudge someone for wanting to play it, I would vastly prefer a game like Citadels.

A buccaneer's battle of wits. The game is very well produced for such a light mix of press-your-luck and deduction, but Libertalia has never managed to grab me.

[original review 2013-08-22; edited 2015-04-13, rating raised from 6.5 to 7]
1 to 5 Scale Rating:
5.0 = Production
      *Great components, if a tad superfluous
4.0 = Design
      *Easy to learn, easier to win with some poker sensibilities. Runaway leader possible, which dampers lagging players' enjoyment.
2.5 = Packaging
      *The exterior is attractive, but inside half of the box was smartly designed, the other half shortsightedly. Also, it tends to bulge the cover.

I enjoy it, although it took awhile for me to grasp a winner's approach. The first game with two players to whom I introduced it started out not to the eventual winner's liking because we wound up playing the same cards the first 3-4 rounds. I thought it was amusing and revealing that our minds were so in sync, but also pointed out that the tactics would change as we accumulated different booty and in subsequent campaigns when our starting hands would have slightly more variation.

Recommendations:
1) Keep your "removed from game" cards in the box (there are six deck slots) after each campaign.
2) I originally suggested random starting hands, for variety's sake. I warned this may risk imbalanced play. I don't know what I was thinking. The gameplay would change dramatically. The act of reading other players by their choices, especially in the first campaign, would go away entirely without knowing their hand. It would not be the same game.

Seems pretty fun so far, although the tiebreaker distribution thing may end up annoying. With more than 4 players, it is mainly about your own cards, while with less, you can worry about others. I like it better with less.

After a few more plays, I am moving this from an 8 to a 7 because of the lack of meaningful player interaction. I mainly worry only about what order to play the cards in and do not think about bluffing or guessing what the other players will play as much as I would like to have to.

I love, love, love:
- the artwork!
- the bluffing and mind-game you play with each other
- planning out which cards to keep and which to play and in what order and remembering which cards my opponent still has in his hand
- that it's not just about beating out your opponents in getting the treasure or killing off one of their Den characters but also the bonuses of sending out and getting back the right crew for what is going on in your own Den
- the character cards' rather thematic effects and flavor text
- the multiple layers of cards activating now vs every night vs at the end of the week
- the ordering of cards for their day effects vs the order for claiming booty tiles

I dislike:
- the not-as-thematic element of knowing ahead of time what the available booty will be every single day

Final verdict: Love this card game, though it can be AP-heavy due to the many cards in your hands and everyone else's, the available booty tokens, the bonuses on the cards, the timing of the crewmembers' actions, and the interactions between the cards.

RATING: 7
Chaotic and fun (I have a blast regardless of whether I win or lose).  Not as psychological as Citadels because there are so many cards and after the first round, not everyone has the same hand, but I like it better.  Game lasts a bit longer than it should if players are inclined to AP (this game is pretty good at nurturing that too as you get so many new cards at once and have to analyze them, then analyze them in terms of the booty, then analyze them in terms of what you think others will do).  One thing I do know, while thematic, the score board is garbage.  Pieces slide easily and it's easy to lose track of where you're going/even skip over to other columns.  Wanted to add that this game makes me laugh a lot.  You can get some pretty hilarious situations when you ENTIRELY misread what others are going to do or everyone is thinking the exact same thing.

Rating based on one play, so it might go up. All players were confused the first round. A lot of cards to study. However, the understanding and tension increased during the three campaigns.

What I disliked was the big differences in score, which made the game not very exciting towards the end.

Really interesting little card game. The board is superfluous and I think I would have been quick annoyed if I had paid for this (I received it in trade) as this should have been a small card game filler type in a much smaller box and at a lower price point, however....

I actually quite like it, the theme is irrelevant if could have been anything but the artwork is very good, the cards are high quality, player 'dens' not so much, but then they are not really needed either.

I like that there are more cards than you will see in a game thus there will always be variation. I like that everyone draws the same cards and must attempt to maximise the profits that can be gained from playing those cards in a particular order but must also postulate what his opponents might play and how that might affect his/her plans.

I am itching to play this again immediately... but unfortunately sometime you have to be a grown up and go to work :(

Much of the joy of the game is seeing which cards I'm forced to make work together and whether I can play a hand better than my opponents can play the identical hand.  There's a lot going on with the cards themselves, enough that the game can feel more chaotic than strategic at times.  But in the first couple of games I've played, it's definitely the deeper thinkers and guessers that have won.

This game turned out to have more depth than I was expecting.  It's still pretty light, but it's still subject to significant analysis paralysis with some.  I had also heard that it could easily be played in 45 minutes when the reality for me has been about 90 (with 5-6 players).  I don't know how often I would bring this out with non-gamers, but I would certainly recommend it as a light offering for a gamer family!

Deceptively simple, yet with great depth as you try to figure out the order or card play. Highly interactive and balanced with lots of colour/flavor (as opposed to true theme)

A pirate themed card game that is a lot of fun. I suppose the twist is that you all have identical cards so there is a matter of reading your opponents situation and the game board and trying to predict what card they will play.
Lots of laugh out loud moments when someone's plan unravels or there is a boat full of beggars or monkeys.
Nice and easy to pick up and teach as well.

Csak online próbáltam, de nagyon jó lenne élőben is tesztelni. Egyszerű, de kombinatív kártyás játéknak tűnik, ami nagyon a zsánerem.
Ráadásul hatan is jó elvileg, mondjuk ezt a tulajdonságát sajna kicsi kiüti a tény, hogy nyelvfüggő.

Pont jó lenne bulikban ismerősökkel játszani, mert 6 fős, és elég könnyen tanulható, viszont szórakoztatóan sok benne az interakció, de a nyelvfüggőség miatt, nem igazán tudom én ilyenre használni.

This would be a mediocre role selection game at best if it weren't for the stroke of genius that is the hand setup. Each game you will have a different set of cards but every player has the same. That means a lot of possible combinations but no luck of the draw.

The only reason I don't rate this higher is that I never really liked the theme of pirates divying up the loot in a game where the procuring of the loot is a non issue.

Family game of pirate raids played over 3 campaigns.  Players are dealt the same cards, but as they play them, the remaining cards will vary creating card interaction.  Cards interact with each other via specified rules governing their interaction.  Some bluffing and player reading.  Little light for my tastes.

Beautiful artwork and sort of a neat idea, Libertalia however fell flat for me. I found the decisions that I was making uninteresting and at a number of times they were unimportant. I tried to consider what other players would throw down and how that would affect my action, but with 4 other players in the mix, there is too much chaos to actually make any meaningful decisions. Sadly, the game repeats three times and never really feels like it's developing, so it just feels like you're playing the same chaotic card game three times over. For players who like the unexpected surprises of a chaotic game might like this highly. But for me, the chaos was too much like Roborally, where all moves are locked in, and the effects are supposed to be amusing but here they're annoying.

Just feels way to random for my taste and I usually like some randomness. It's a game of outguessing your opponents but that is pretty much the only mechanic so it's about a 1/2 hour longer then I would like it to be. Even if the game was 1/2 as long as it is it would only bump up 1 point to a 5

Very nice game. Actually I think it wouldn't have lost much of its charm after changing it into cards-only game (no boards and bits - see Aladdin's Dragons Card Game).
Lots of neat ideas, cool role selection, prone to group-thinking.

Like it. I'd like to own it, but won't insist.

Once again - very nice and somewhat charming.
And I terribly suck in this game. :)

I thought this was pretty solid, if perhaps a bit long for what it is.  Guessing/timing (ala citadels) is coupled with a fair bit of strategy.  3 rounds with 9 cards seemed long to me, although you could easily house rule it to a lower number.  I think you could also add variants easily like drafting, etc., so the core mechanics work well IMO.

- Can be chaotic/random. Your plans will not always work out. Normally randomness bothers me in games, but that's its the type of randomness where you *can't* plan. In this game, I can always think of a plan, and if it doesn't pan out, no problem, still tons of fun.
- Tie breakers certainly *feel* broken

I bought this for my sister for Christmas. I was really excited to play it but it let me down a little. I think I'll reserve judgment until we play again, but it seemed like there wasn't as much to it as I would've liked. I certainly think playing again and knowing the majority of the cards and some basic strategy would help. I was able to guess correctly a few times at what would be played and that made it more interesting.

Arrrr, pirates. This one suffers a little from ambiguous translation on some of the card abilities, but there are guides online to help out with that. On the surface a silly game of passing cursed relics like a hot potato and punching yourself in the face and falling in the sea. The card-counting aspect adds some strategic depth, and some of the cards reward very careful timing.

RATING: 7
The pirate ship theme fits well due to gritty artwork and cutthroat game play. As with many text-based card games, familiarity is rewarded. Not a game you can jump right into and compete. Rather, it helps to have a preexisting knowledge of the card powers, or at least to have plenty of time to read the cards during the game. An ill-informed decision early can put you out of contention for the rest of the game.

Fun but not one I crave to play, really needs 4-6 players to make it worth while, and even then it is very dependant on the group being fun people.  Definitely novel and a solid game, but not an absolute lot to sink your teeth into, and there isn't any meta game negotiating to make up for the lack of substance.  Still, it is 100000x better than most small group party games.

I loved Citadels when I first played it. Many plays later, and I sort of soured on the character selection card games. If I play one, I prefer Mission: Red Planet. The fight over space in the ships and the area majority elements improve the character selection mechanic. Libertalia didn't seem to bring a similar improvement to the table. Too much chaos for my tastes, especially at higher player counts.

RATING: 7
Two plays with four, one play with five. It's a simultaneous-card-selection-ype game, where higher numbers are better but each card has a special power that confers other benefits. Pretty fun, though of course it's also agonizing when your plans go haywire. It's also a little on the long side for the chaos level, so it's not something I would want to play every week.

One of the few games when even played with six players there is nut much of a downtime. When playing experienced players will recognise that there are known mechanisms of other games but mixed up with this pirate theme it feels  fresh enough. All players lay out their cards simultaneously (like in Category 5) but of course there is more on the cards than just a number. The lower the number the earlier you can use your special ability (day) and the higher the number the earlier you can choose a piece of booty (dawn). Getting back your pirates from the beat to the cave or cimetary there are more special abilities (night) that will get you some profits (this is has a certain feel of "Citadelles", however less chaotic but still imponderable).

(Only played once, 4-player)

This is predominantly a card game in which every player has a deck of cards identical to the other players', from which some randomly selected cards (the same ones for each player) enter play each round.

What's interesting is how quickly players' paths diverge, while all starting out with the same cards.

What I don't (ever) like, and this somewhat ruins the game for me, is that when other players make you discard a card, it's them that choose which one.

This game is just fun. The flow is just great and plays quite fast and plays a crowd, without adding really any extra time. All the cards have great artwork and finding when to trigger the character powers at the right moments leads to some awesome plays. Great game, wish an expansion would release but it is not necessary. There's a whole lot of game in this box. Everyone that I taught it to fell in love with it.

The game has fallen a bit from grace for me due to there probably never will be an expansion for it at this point. The game still is fun to play but new characters would really bring this game back to the table more

Update: Still enjoy this game, but seriously 5 years not one expansion of even like 5 new characters....anything?!? I ended up trading it away, because the game is great and well deserved for an expansion by now, or even a Libertalia sequel/remake with more characters. I may pick it up again down the line, but it's been played to death in my game group

This game has quickly launched itself to the top of my all-time favorite games list. It does the full-information low luck euro strategy ruleset extremely well, and also integrates the pirate theme beautifully in a way that makes the rules make sense. 

At the end of the day, this is the best of Euro mixed with the best of Ameritrash. BUY IT!

A fairly simple blind bidding game with some interesting card effects along the way, a sort of For Sale meets Citadels if you like. There's enough chaos with arbitrary character assassinations that this isn't one to take seriously, but plenty of great art to make it attractive.

RATING: 7
This is a blind bidding game but with special powers. I did enjoy the Cities-esque thing where everyone has the same cards, but those cards vary from one game to another.  There are three ages of the game, each with six bidding rounds. Because many of those rounds are as much about avoiding negative points and gaining positive ones, it is very reminiscent of Beowulf: The Legend. (1 play)

One of my wife's favorites, and generally a group favorite as well. It seems my group loves games with just a bit of "Take that!" in it. Everyone has a thick skin, and laughter is always in good supply, particularly when Libertalia comes out.  It's easy to teach, plays relatively quickly, and gets everyone talking like pirates near the entire time.

I love this one. There's so much game in the box - the puzzle of figuring out how to deal with the hand you get THIS time keeps me engaged every game. I love trying to puzzle out what everybody else will do. I find it's at its most fluid when folks don't do TOO much overthinking and just go with their gut.

Good game, one of the best in its genre (role selection). The fact that everyone has almost the exact same characters each round and that it happens very often that multiple players will play the same character is my main complaint about this game.

Good design - from the characters (who have lots of character) to the boat and board.

I love this game. There is chaos, but ideally, you manage your turns for the entire round at the beginning of it and only make adjustments when needed. 

I actually enjoy it more with few players, because then your planning has more power, because there are fewer possibilities.

I have only played on BGA, and they really need to make it publicly listed there which colors have which tie-breaker numbers, because that is a huge influencer.

Enjoyable bluffing game. Don't love the pirate theme too much, but it fits very well with the game mechanics. (8.4) 03/15

Edit: I actually enjoy the theme of this game more after several more plays, but one thing in particular is keeping it down: the beggar. This card is fine with small numbers of players, but if you have four and above it becomes far too punishing. Everyone tends to open beggar on the first round, which (with four players) leaves the highest influence beggar with -9 doubloons and everyone else with +3. There is no way to play around this other than by wasting your monkey, which of course is often not available anyway. This card really should have had a higher number or been scaled down with higher player counts. A similar problem exists with the monkey, but it's less bad because you can just save it for a later round. (8.2) 03/15

RATING: 8.15
The game works best with at least 4 players.  It's an action selection game where you have all the same cards and everyone else.  That leads to a huge social part of this game where you try to talk others into playing a card benificial to you vs the other players.

Does not work with just two people.

RATING: 7.5
A cross between Citadels and For Sale where simultaneous card reveals determine role selection and turn order which gives each player the ability to win VP "booty" over the course of three rounds of play. Strategy with heavy bouts of "gut-feel" and bluffing keep this game tense and interesting through to the end. Setup is a bit finicky but not overly problematic. An enjoyable game for 3-6 with more players becoming more chaotic.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (October 2014)

I really dislike pirate themed games (thanks to Merchants & Marauders), but Paolo Mori is a designer I respect a lot. Still it took me a long time for me to play Libertalia, but I’m glad I did. The game is pretty fun.

The rules are easy to teach and the game flows quickly, but it has very interesting decisions (basically which card to play) trying to outthink your opponents and acquiring what you want. I really like that each player begins and acquire the same characters so I feel the game is fair and balanced, and the attacks are restricted to your immediate neighbors (most of the time). Due to this, I feel the important factor in the game is how each player uses his hand and luck plays a very minor role. I also like that in each game, you play with only a part of the possible characters, making Libertalia´ s replayability factor very high. Having a good memory can be an advantage playing the game-

The art is great.

As all player plays simultaneously, the playtime isn’t affected much by the player count, however I think Libertalia is best played with four players.

Bottom line, a quick paced game that I’m enjoying at the time. I foresee many more games of Libertalia in the near future. My favorite pirate theme game.

Current Rating: 7.0

After more plays, I no longer have a burning desire to play Libertalia, so perhaps the replayability factor wasn’t as high as I though. Most of my games feel the same way although they continue to be fun.

Due to this I’m downgrading its rating. I still consider it a good game.

Pirate-looting-character-selection-robbery game.

Everyone gets the same cards, so it makes the game less random and more 'mind-read-ey'. "Will she play that character? Or the other one? But if she does, then what if he plays that one? Arr, I should just play the Cabin Boy and hope for the best!"
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is great fun with a many tense decisions and a lot of player interaction.

Takes the character selection from Citadels but allows everyone to choose at the same time (cutting out what can be a little tedious in Citadels), with everyone choosing from the same subset of characters.

Replaces the building aspects of Citadels with choosing from a pot of tiles, some good, some bad, although with the right character at the right time the bad ones can be made good. 

Doesn't sound like it should be fun, but it is.

Probably best with 3 or 4 - gets very chaotic with more.

Strategy game in which players select crew members to obtain victory point-giving treasures while others use the same crew options to try and stop you. However, crew selection is based on the youngest player's random draw, meaning that you end up spending time trying to find the same ones in every other deck.

PLUS: good use of strategy, variants caused by not using the full deck
MINUS: if a player falls behind they can't catch up without the others failing badly next round

Wonderful fun.  A fresh design, great production values, plays up to 6 very comfortably and doesn't suffer too badly with play length.

The Pirate theme comes through well enough, due to the roles, the flavor text, and the art, but there isn't so much "piraty" about it insofar as its actions.

The simultaneous roles selection is one of my favorite mechanics, so this appeals to me very well.  Games always seem competitive, despite the variation in potential strategy/tactics.

I like it.

Some basic tactics/strategy but nothing super long-term or rewarding. The random picks of your opponents will largely dictate how well you do but their decision space is too large to evaluate in a meaningful way... i.e. it's pretty random. You can spend a lot of time thinking about the decisions too which bogs down the game needlessly.

On top of that it isn't fun :S

Initially, every player/pirate has the same roles on hand. Simultaneously, roles are chosen and executed with the ultimate goal to grab the most valuable booty. Necessarily, there's some randomness involved but enough indications exist to allow for meaningful guesswork. The always different combinations of role cards provide enough variety and potential for differing strategies. Best at the upper player limit - one of the few games I would recommend for six players.

With 5 players, this game was a blast. I would have liked being able to target the people across the table.

I have a hard time imagining a better pirate game.

According to Rimas, when they bought the game, it was described as Citadels with more characters. Of course, these two games have something in common: e.g. psychological aspect of guessing, who chose which role. However, I wouldn't claim that they are very close. In any case, psychology is a very important part of the game: not to get in front too early, outsmarting your opponents with character cards. You cannot be too sure about your plans, because neighbours can screw you with sword booty or with characters. It's an interesting game with different feel than a standard Euro. Maybe, that is why it can be associated with Citadels.

Anot Rimo, perkant šį žaidimą apibūdino kaip Citadeles su daugiau veikėjų. Turi, žinoma, šie žaidimai šį tą bendro - pavyzdžiui psichologinį aspektą bandant nuspėti, kurią rolę pasirinko kuris žaidėjas. Tačiau, nepasakyčiau, kad jie yra labai artimi. Visais atvejais, psichologija yra svarbus šio žaidimo aspektas - neišsišokti per anksti, pergudrauti varžovus su rolėmis. Savo planais niekada per daug negali pasitikėti, nes kaimynai gali juos sujaukti kardo lobiu arba veikėjų kortomis. Įdomus, kiek kitoks, nei standartiniai Euro tipo žaidimai. Turbūt todėl jis ir primena Citadeles.

RATING: 6
Interesting game that has some clever decisions for its players.  May have a runaway leader problem though, it seems as if someone who has two good rounds will be unstoppable in the third.

Update: Definitely has a leader issue that, for me, makes the game less desirable.  By round 3, it was clear that only 1 or 2 people in a 6 player game had a chance at winning.  Again, it's tough to stay in contention if you have trouble in the first round.

Some say this game is a replacement for citadels; I say there could be room for both. However, this game lets you become a pirate. The game is cutthroat and vicious. Would have been a keeper but the setup and duration felt too long for a game that feels like it should just be a filler.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Watching Wil Wheaton's tabletop episode of Libertalia was a much funnier experience than playing the game. Overall its an ok game, but basically it comes down to counting cards and eliminating options. There a lot of random factors but you can mitigate those with the right card play - if you know which cards are still in play.

So good Poker and Black Jack players are king I suppose, or if you can generally memorize cards quickly and understand their value/powers. Its nice the game goes up to 6 players for larger groups, but it won't really hit the table that many times, at least not in our group.

The comparisons with [i]Citadels[/i] and [i]Mission Red Planet[/i] are obvious. For what it is, [i]Libertalia[/i] is very good. However, it is just not my sort of game. In many games, I am just fine with 'take that", but in this game, I do not like it.

I'm torn about the rating. I think it is quite a good game, but not my style.

The various cards are cool, and so is the execution of their powers. The best part, however, is how your hands start out the same, but get different over time: which cards to use now, in which order, and which one to keep, that's where the game lies.

This game is good with gamers, but I'd never call it a family game.  I couldn't imagine trying to explain the day-night-anchor system to my wife or 10-year-old daughter, who can both play Stone Age, which has a higher weight ranking.  I've tried to explain Libertalia to gamers several times and there are always major questions. It is just more complicated than a casual person can grasp.

So, not a bad game, but in my opinion it is in the wrong category.

This is a fun game, more depth and strategy than I suspected before playing it.  Lots of take that mechanic, constantly evolving and changing of strategy due to what others are doing.

I think we will move to a dice variant that some people use instead of the standard rules.

Very cool game. I play this on Board Game Arena and it just flows well. You really need to keep track of your opponents so I like this at 2 or 3. I would avoid it with more than 4 because then it just becomes too chaotic. Anticipating others' moves is fun and works quite well in this game.

RATING: N/A
A nice game for higher player counts (not that great with 2p) where everyone has the same cards 9 cards out of 30, and each player plays one card each day of the week; the highest card played each day gets to take treasure first. Cards have various powers, some immediate some ongoing, and the different treasures have various effects, so that each turn really requires some thought. You play 3 weeks, and each subsequent week you get to keep 3 cards from the previous week (the other players do not know for sure which cards you are keeping) and add 9 new cards to your hand. Even though you need to think things through, it is a pretty light game. Excellent insert holds everything nicely.

RATING: 8
Reserving judgment after one play.  One of the players really disliked the game, mainly because he lost pretty much every tiebreaker.  I like almost everything about this game, but do see this as a problem.  Would like to play more...

Edit:  Played again with four and the tie breaking wasn't really an issue.  Very enjoyable.  Very glad I own this game and look forward to playing more in the future.  My wife, who is averse to learning and playing new games, complained at first but after the game said she liked it and would play again.  That's a huge win.

Played it once so far.  At first I was apprehensive and thought I'd hate it.  But once it got going I really enjoyed it and had my brain melted a little.  I can't wait to play again and hope to pick it up soon for myself!

UPDATE:  Played numerous times and bought it since my initial comments.  I suggest it quite a bit now.

Update 05-28-2013 - Still like this one but just never want to pull it out to play it!  I don't know why really, I think it's great.  But just thinking about playing it... I don't feel like it.  I think I'm just getting over "card games".  I want components and pieces to move around and place and Libertalia doesn't have that.  Down to a 7.

Tactical skills pirate themed game. 

In Libertalia, you must thwart the plans of competitive pirates over the course of three rounds while using cards that show the same crew members as your piratical comrades-in-arms. Yes, not only do they attack the same ships, but they employ the same type of ravenous scum that you do! Can you take advantage of the powers of your characters at the right time? Will you be outdone by a pirate smarter than you? Jump into the water and prove your tactical skills!

Comments after video review

Seem pretty abstract to me, theme seems pretty thin. Game seem to resolve around splitting loot, like cash and guns with character cards. There is no adventuring.

It's basically some sort of role selection game where you have almost the same role as all other players but where the selection is random.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
It's a nice simultaneous "group think" pirate card game with a central sequencing mechanism for characters.  Everyone starts with the same deck but after 1st round, decks are somewhat different and mainly different near the final round.  It's good fun, especially for a large group of 5 to 6 players, where each pirate needs to out-think the others to succeed.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Happy to play someone else's copy.  This is a quick playing "role selection" game which also involves a fair bit of take that in the roles (but everyone has the same cards - it is more about timing the most efficient use of the cards and being able to guess what roles the others may select.  Still, there is the element of beating down someone who is far behind that can be frustrating...  

Reminds me a bit of Citadels, another game that did not survive long in my collection...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Really solid role selection game. While you all start with the same cards, the strategies get really divergent based on how you think things will turn out and the 'rank' of the card that you happen to have. Room to plan for things but your plans won't always turn out the way you like!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Summary: interactive, fast paced, interesting even for gamers, but still very accessible to newcomers, quite original (it makes me think of Citadels and Coup, but feels richer to me, and turns faster).

Pros:
+ Card powers are varied.
+ The cards you get are never the same.
+ You can find combos in your cards.
+ You can plan (for the week).
+ The booties coming up shape your strategy. They are different in every game.
+ The game is interactive (killings, powers, small negotiations).
+ The game is almost simultaneous.
+ You keep your unplayed cards in your hand between weeks, which makes each player a little different from the others over time.
+ Not too long.
+ Nice drawings.

Cons:
- Does not work with 2.
- I can see how it is hard to make a come back after a bad turn.

RATING: 4
This game has lots of neat interactions between its cards, and I like that knowing what everyone initially has makes this game strategic while the order of everything being played and the different tie breaker priority of the players makes it so you are never exactly sure what is about to happen. The keeping of unused cards each round manages to add differentiation of play styles without adding luck of the draw, but this is a bit disadvantageous to newer players since they don't know all the synergies of all the cards and if they should save a card for a future round.

There is variability not only in different player play styles causing you to guess which card is best to play and having different cards each game but also if using a high/low card is worth it this early/late depending on what loot is available.

I think the theme implementation was just okay. There seems to be neither mechanic-theme harmony or discord. However mechanically I love how turn order is decided and how managing which high cards you need to save to take which treasure is important.

EDIT: I still really like how the card powers interact with each other combined with hand management and trying to outguess your opponents, but despite the interaction this game just feels so soulless. The pirate theme doesn't really come out at all (as opposed to my previous saying there is no thematic discord) and I'm using all these neat card powers for the end result of a +3 point token. It just feels like  I am scoring for scoring's sake.

I find it brilliant with three players where it is actually possible to predict the other's actions and have a degree of trying to anticipate and plan ahead. With more players there are too many variables and it becomes a lot more luck based (unless you are much better at it than me).

You really feel like a pirate too! Not many "pirate" games deliver!

For me it has fallen out of favor because there isn't much to explore compared to some of my other favorite card games (Race for the Galaxy, Seven Wonders), and it feels completely random unless all players are deeply invested in building a strong game plan.

I would not say it has completely killed Citadels either, because Citadels is simpler and requires less mental effort  and setup. Citadels is a filler, whereas Libertalia is a main course.

You are given a starting hand of 9 cards that is the same for  all players.  You play 6 cards and depending the power of the card, players can draft treasure or penalties each turn.  At the end of the turn, you get 6 new cards but keep the three unplayed cards so the card options diverge.  

Even though the cards have power from 1 to 30, there are special powers where you may cancel a stronger card, pick before other players, skip playing, etc.  They have end of week and end of game powers as well.  

A fun game that plays in a reasonable amount of time and higher player counts since all player simultaneously show there.

Good, fun roleselection game. The mechanic where the game uses the advantage of a card game with speed and simultaneous action selection combined with all players getting the same cards each round is brilliant. It removes alot of the normal luck factor cardgames normally come with. since only two third of the cards is used each round it also creats a bit of dynamic between players and rounds. Lots of in game interaction as well and a little bit of bluffing. All set up in a less than an hour gameplay makes it the perfekt semifiller or to bring on the holiday game. And it has a huge fun factor this game.
The only little drawback is that it is pretty langueage dependent otherwise it would have been perfect for kids knowing how to read. Guess I will have to translate it to swedish myself rather soon. Enjoy it all...

Rating upgraded to 8.5 after 10 games just because it is so enjoying and swift to play, with really high replayability.

RATING: 8.5
Excellent game, with a very interesting mechanic (everyone has the same resources but they can play them very differently).  High replayability, good components, fun, interactive.  I enjoyed it so much that I am looking forward to playing other games from this designer.  Still enjoyable and still sought after repeated plays.  Beautiful components, nice art and little details (the little differences in the look of the player's islands and flags) add to the whole experience.   Also, very low downtime thanks to the simultaneous action selection mechanism.

Update, May 2016:  The more I play this game, the more I like it and admire the design.  It is a "game you play" with "luck of the event."  Different cards, different treasures, different scoring opportunities. but they are all known and fixed.  The game is actually low/no-luck with deduction/bluffing, my favorite kind.  The random card setup at the beginning of every round does not determine the outcome of a player's strategy or tactics, just adds an element of variety. Players feel that they have control over the cards given to them, and can develop strategies, and the real challenge is in outguessing or outsmarting your opponent rather than hoping for a lucky draw.

Update July 2017:  Having played now 6 Nimmt I find that card game to give the enjoyment of Libertalia in a more elegant system with less overhead, which has reduced my enjoyment of Libertalia.  Libertalia looks much better and has more "stuff" going on with the cards, but that is not always a plus.  I am becoming increasingly tired of reading cards with unique special effects, especially when playing in the evening.  Libertalia also has a tableau/engine building aspect missing from 6 Nimmt, and that is a plus.

Played once. Liked it a lot, it's dynamic, interactive, though potentially too chaotic (but in a short game I can usually tolerate that).
Artwork is good, although trying too hard to look like Pirates of the Caribbean.

I like the simultaneous secret card reveal mechanic.  The theme is strong and the components are nice.  My only negative is the ability to mess with other players is too strong for most people.  I'm ok with the assassination mechanic but I've watched others get really mad and remove themselves from having fun/play.

RATING: 7
As a hidden role selection game, I prefer this game over Citadels and Mission: Red Planet.  Citadels feels like a boring worker placement game that you know what you're next move is, only obstacle is "inconvenience" while Mission: Red Planet is too random to be taken seriously at any level.

I'll throw in the good stuff before we'll go to the bad.  The rulebook, artwork, and replay value of the game is fascinating.  All the rules flow well, make sense, and the iconography is understandable.  On paper, the game sounds excellent, so where's the problem?

Like telling a good joke, making a good game requires proper execution.  Libertalia fails at this at several levels.

First, the scoring.  In this game, your doubloons are your points and they always reset to 10 after each campaign (game ends after 3 campaigns).  The issue with this is you can have someone score big on a single round, the rest of the game can feel like catching up with that player for the next 30 minutes.  I've won games where I scored big on the first round, did mediocre on the second round and third, but still came out victorious.  To say the least, winning felt unrewarding.  What would've fixed this problem is something borrowed from Formula 1 racing, where the highest player scores a certain amount of points, second highest scores a certain number of points, and so forth.  Reward consistency, not lucky plays.

Another issue is the game becomes far too chaotic with 5-6 players.  The game works fine with 3 to 4 players, and doesn't work at all with 2 players.  With a larger amount of players, there is so much calculation and variables that it's far better tactic to simply go with gut feelings instead of trying to outsmart the table.  This isn't a good sign.

Finally, I felt the game wasn't driven by clever play or proper decisions.  Most of the game felt you played a card and hoped the other players didn't screw you over.  They are moments where you need to read other players and remember what they played, but those moments are far too few for the price of admission.  Most of the game is filled with chaotic elements that you cannot comprehend to make any meaningful decision.

I don't actively dislike the game, but there are many other games I prefer in my collection over Libertalia.  Two good alternatives to Libertalia would be Evolution: Climate and Roll for the Galaxy.

I Love character selection games. Put a pirate theme on it, and you have a winner. In this game everybody all has the same characters to choose from though, and i prefer the only one copy of each character method found in Citadels. however this is lighter and more party friendly. Although in my group, Libertalia has a surprisingly long length of play, as there are so many options. And for beginners, they tend to be too indecisive, making the game drag out.

Interesting seeing how the different cards interact and longer term strategies which are available across the different 3 missions.

A fair amount of strategy available in this game and need to be careful as the pirates in your den can be attacked via various means, which can make carefully crafted plans go awry.  Plenty of player interaction.

RATING: 8
Fantastic, easy to learn game with good depth.  I love that all players start with the same set of nine cards and must determine the optimal order in which to play them.  You must consider what card you think the other players are going to play, the functions of each card and how they work in conjunction with one another (to set up combos), and the distribution of booty tiles up for grabs each day.  The game has a lot of re-playability due to the initial selection of 9 random cards from the total of 30 and because of the random distribution of booty tiles.

**********

I think most people overvalue the booty tiles on a given day rather than looking at the big picture. Some days are worth tanking on the booty tiles if the character benefits can be chained with future characters, if future days have a wider distribution of booty tiles, etc. Also, you can't play this game well unless you have at least a vague game plan for the week before even playing your first card.

07/18/17 Played a three-player game in 55 minutes. I liked the theme: pirates. And that it only took about an hour. But the game is rather random. I think in hindsight I was lucky there were only three players tonight. Afterwards I read comments on BGG of people saying that with 5-6 its shear chaos. I believe it. Its not a bad game, but its nothing to write home about either. I'd play it again (with no more than three, and not closer together than six months), but I'd never ask for it.

An interesting pirate themed game, where players are given the exact same characters, but the order you play them will make a huge difference, especially from the second week and onwards. Players play cards in order to claim treasures, get benefits and to earn bonus points at the end of the game. Timing is essential, especially if you hope to keep your characters in play until you dock at the end of the week.

All in all an enjoyable game.

RATING: 8.5
This game continues to grow on me.  As you learn it, it becomes faster and even deeper assuming you're playing with players who's knowledge is similar.  It plays quickly, engrosses you in theme, and supports up to six people. I look forward to playing this game for a long time to come.

Tie-Break Variant #1:
Use the pirate flag tokens and line them up randomly at the top of the board.  Any time there is a tie, use the relative position of the tokens to determine the order.  Then move the highest, right-most, flag to the back of the queue.  Any time a tie occurs, move the flags; one movement for each tie.

Tie-Break Variant #2:
Give each player a die and randomly determine their values, 1-6, one value per player.  Any tie break uses the player's die value to determine order.  When a tie occurs, swap the value of each players die with their tied opponent.

I have a personal attachment to this game. The theme, artwork, mechanics all come together so beautifully. It really makes you feel like you're on the high seas with a bunch of other pirates. There are many who complain that it might be samey after some plays, but I think the strategy is much deeper than what they first assume, and trying to guess what the others will play is the center of the strategy.

Fun, light, tactical card game, with some room for planning.  Game plays quickly once players are somewhat familiar with the different card abilities and interactions.

There is some aspect to plan out the turn given the booty tiles available and a good memory of what players have left and their playing style. 

Scales up pretty well I think and probably plays better with more players, I prefer 5 player games, but 4 or 6 work well too.

All of my plays have been with six players, the maximum. Because of the simultaneous play, it still goes rather quickly and involves a lot of second guessing. I would like to try it at lower player counts to see how the play changes. The challenge of out-thinking your opponents when you all share the same resources is quite good.

I've since played the game with four and the play did change as predicted. I don't know if it was better or worse (though it did play faster) but still very enjoyable.

RATING: 7
A fun, beautiful game that plays in about an hour - even with a pretty big group.  Players are simultaneously selecting actions and at the start of the game all players have the same actions.  As a result, you are playing the other players more than the game: you have to guess what others might play and how you can gain an advantage over them. A neat, surprising, cutthroat, take-that game. 

2015-06:  Traded it away. A pretty good game, but not great for me.  In contrast to what is written above, I felt like actual plays of the game came down tests of memory:  "do you remember if anyone still has the #17 card?"  Also, the lay of treasures often made position irrelevant.  These things left me feeling like I was making mostly random choices, getting hit with random effects and then being granted random rewards or penalties.  Too long to be a filler, too chaotic and light to be a main event.

Interesting mechanics with some fun but fleeting interaction between players.  Little opportunity to impact players outside of those to your left or right, and amongst those the most impact is to the player on the left (there is some influence you can do on other players by taking certain booty, but nothing direct).  Strategy is also light to medium, with long-term planning hedged by uncertainty of what cards will come up in the later rounds.  Really, it's an okay game, but I find it lacking a distinguishing characteristic that would lead me to want to own it or play if over another game.  

Though the initial strategy of which card to play, knowing that others have similar cards and may also play them, is very engaging, the fallout from all this is a unrewarding money-grab and point allocation.  

In short, the game is fun work but boring reward.

Unique card game. Everyone having the same deck is what makes this game great. You know what everyone else has in their starting hand, so you're running through bluffs, double bluffs, and some memorization in order to outwit your opponents through the games turns.

The production is great, and I like that there is a lot of underlying strategy to be explored with the different card combinations. There is definitely a rich get richer issue though, which wore on me enough that I was okay getting rid of this in favor of Mission: Red Planet and Scoundrel Society.

I had hoped that Libertalia's simultaneous game of select and play cards at the same time would make it excellent for big groups. However, the game itself was unengaging and monotonous. Choose a secret card to choose one of several treasures in competition with the other players' secretly chosen cards. Rinse and repeat. I'm sure skilled players can predict which cards the other players play and how the remaining cards can be combined but I have no interest in reaching that level.

I can appreciate the subtlety of the cards and the mindgames and Libertalia is perhaps a good game in the end, but I dislike the tie-breaker system and anything favouring some insane memory about which quite wordy cards have been played by whom.

It's like poker. You are playing mind games every turn, and try to get the best items by predicting what your opponent may play. If you are into trick-taking game, it's a perfect game for you. 

The luck has been minimized as all players were dealt the same hand, but with added cards each week there's a slight variance in which the cards player may hold - which is where the game shines, as you can strategically held off some cards to play in later rounds. 

As a player with considerable success of this game in BGA, The small problem about this game is once everyone is playing at high levels, moves may become predictable. As tiebreak is done by the number on the cards, the luck factor actually matters more in games among experts.

Players start the game with the exact same character cards. Each day, they play one card to compete for goods. The highest played card gets to choose first. Each character has special abilities, such as discarding other people's cards or earning money. The game is played over a number of rounds; you keep 3 unplayed cards from the previous rounds, so there is a bit of keeping track of what others have played, and some guesswork. 

It's a fun game, due to the uncertainty of what each fight for goods will bring, and there are lots of tactics and planning. The English rules are a bit brief and don't explain the anchor symbol for instance on the cards. I'm looking forward to more plays.

Looks like a super fun simultaneous action selection game which I love. The cool pirate theme and ocmponents seem really awesome with this one. I'm disappointed that it really seems to benefit or even hinge on having more players rather than less since I'm mostly in the market for games that play NEARLY as well with 2 as they do with more at the very least and if this one is much worse with 2 than 5 by a substantial margin than its probably out for us. Regardless, I'd love to play it and try it out because it looks awesome.

Surprisingly fun game all about figuring out what the other plays will do and responding accordingly. Quick to learn with intuitive card powers and scoring. Too often comes down to tie breakers as the "right" card choice is sometimes obvious with little counter play and many people choose it. Compounding this issue is that these tie breakers can lead to big point swings

A simple game that starts feeling really complex really fast. Feels to me like 4 players would be optimal. 5 or  winds up just feeling like a crapshoot because there's no way you can keep track of who has played what. It's not bad with a higher play count though, just has a bit more of a chaotic feel.

A fun game that is easy to learn and has some good strategy. Definitely better than citadels for a role selection game. However, much more of a social game as you must read you opponents and out bluff them to win. Really nice production value and the pirate theme is done well. New players pick this up really quick and enjoy the game from first play. This is my preference for a filler game, as there is a lot of substance within the 40 min playtime.

Plays pretty quickly and it's quite fun.

The cards are interesting to play, and it's fun to try and figure out some combos from the roles you randomly draw.

The artwork on the cover of the game is great and so are the individual cards.  No problem with the tokens either, though it would have been more efficient to just print the value of the booty tokens (1, 3 and 5) rather than have them represented as a barrel, gems and a treasure chest, but I guess they wanted more theme immersion.  Not a biggy, you quickly grasp their value.

This might be a Citadels-killer though there is no building construction, but the role-playing, bluffing and outguessing is certainly there.

UPDATE:
Sad that the maker of this game could not bring an expansion to life.  Maybe down the road they'd reconsider.

UPDATE 2:
Played with some friends and they were lukewarm about it. They liked it enough, but it didn't seem like a game they'd want to play again.  Bummer.

Libertalia is a decent game, but has too many fiddly bits. It feels faster than Citadels, which it borrows gameplay from, but isn't as streamlined. Libertalia needs a caretaker to perform the functions of the game, rather than each player being able to complete their turns independently. Basically, people make their choices and then one player explains to everyone what their choices did for them. A multiplayer game like this should not require a DM.

If it gets a 2nd edition, Libertalia is definitely a game that needs some clarification about some rules and cards. The worst offender being the Preacher. If his text is [mis-]interpreted to refer to day's booty, rather than booty in the player's den, he just breaks the game as basically no one collects any booty that campaign.

This was a fun game where everyone starts out with the same cards.  Every turn you are fighting for different chits that will determine your score at the end.  Each card has a number and a special ability associated with it that REALLY changes up the game immensely.  

I'd like to play this more because it is a fun game, but could be confusing to new people because of all the crazy abilities on cards and how they interact with the other cards up on the table for each round.

Of all the pirate games I've played to date, this is by far a pirate game.  And it's also the one pirate game I can see with replayability - more than Merchants & Marauders, more than Plunder, and MUCH more than Blackbeard.

The action doesn't really heat up until Round 2 of 3, the rulebook could be clearer on some things, and the first game will be a bit deadly slow because of all the data to take in.  But there's a fun little double-bluff game at work here and I'm looking forward to my next game.

The production level is quite good. The rules are easy and well explained, but the card interactions can become tricky.

In the first round, there will probably be an optimal order for all players to play their characters and most of them will follow it more or less; you can guess some of their moves. But the next 2 rounds will be much more chaotic and random.

There's way too much randomness in this game for me. The chaotic outcome of each turn is fun the first few times, but it later becomes increasingly frustrating as you take some time to think plans and almost all of them go wrong in some way or another. Libertalia lasts too long.

Vasco da Gama resta di un livello superiore. Si è gridato al miracolo ma Libertalia è in realtà un gioco semplice e simpatico senza nulla di originale. Pare ci siano alcuni mazzi (colori) lievemente sbilanciti, ma questi sono dettagli; il gioco (fondamentalmente un gioco di carte) si basa più sull'intuizione che su una chiara strategia. Simpatico e, grazie ad un ampio mazzo, longevo. Disegni sulle carte molto carini.

RATING: 10
Pleasing double-think and screwage-and-hand management card game, with just a little more theme than Guildhall, a little less chaos than Citadels and a little more strategy than Meuterer. Devilishly good theme and art are the real icing on this cake.

[b]Further Thoughts[/b]: The incredible thing about Libertalia, even after dozens of plays, is the sheer variety of play depth and strategy that has been created from just 30 cards. This hasn't even gotten close to being old.

[b]Further, Further Thoughts:[/b] On reflection, Libertalia absolutely has to be promoted to a 10. There is no other game in the games club collection that: a) can be so obsessively requested on games night, b) be driven by a level of skill, despite the (pseudo-)random card distribution and, c) prone to disastrously hilarious role-playing.

Increasingly, we are taking the stance that Libertalia is the quick, 1-hour, semi-filler game to end all games. What more do you want?

Great role selection game that is very thematic. In the end it comes down to a quick card playing game that should be great with little downtime for up to 6 people, so it's seems quiet a bit "overproduced with the big box and the boards, but it just looks great and plays very smooth.

Action selection game. Each player starts with identical "actions" in his hand and has to decide what to play, which determines what order things happen in and who gets to pick rewards first. This game feels like it wants to be a blind Taj Mahal, with players balancing high-value cards, storing points in the "den" for later, and knowing when to pull out early for rewards. But it's just too random to manage. People agonize over their decisions for minutes and then screw it all up. I just threw cards down haphazardly and won. I don't want to play this again, especially at its length. Cut it by half and maybe I'd play once in a while.

[i]I had been looking forward to playing this for years and finally got my chance and wow was I disappointed. We played with 6 players and there were a lot of turns when 3 or 4 of us played the same cards. Then player order is decided by a number on your card... awful mechanic since this happened quite often and made the game feel much more luck based than it seems at first glance. The set collection was okay, but even then there really wasn't much tension and choice. 

I really enjoy role selection games, but I will stick with [i][thing=131357][/thing][/i] where there are very limited roles, but the bluffing mechanic really fleshes out the game play. Libertalia felt extremely dry and mechanical, the theme fell completely flat with me.[/i]

The most basic role selection game ever. The mechanics are simple (select a card every phase) but the specifics of how to do well in this game is very dense and nearly impossible to unravel so I would warn against any long-term strategizing or planning. I love the pirate theme and the artwork is gorgeous. Libertalia is one of the next-step games I show new gamers after Ticket to Ride or Catan.

Game looks pretty and I like some of the mind games that happen.  The game feels to chaotic for what it is, gave me a similar feeling to playing witches brew.  The game also takes way too long for such relatively shallow game play.  I don't hate it, and I would agree to play it again.  However, I think I would rather play For Sale a few times in a row instead of playing this once.  This sort of feels like For Sale with tons of extra rules, phases, play time, and mechanics, but does not make the game much deeper.

This game is easy to learn and teach but has great depth to it and immense re-playability. The mechanic has multiply actions that work simultaneously allowing for players to choose different ways to accumulate the most treasure all while using the same cards as each other.

Highly recommend for any gamers collection.

RATING: 6
Ok, it's simultaneous selection done 18 times, but at least it's done well (even though not being a fan of the genre means I still won't rate it that well). Everyone starts with the same subset of cards, and each card has an effect (good now, good later, good if you have this or that), so you can see what's likely to be played early, and what later, and then determine if you want to be part of the masses or go anti-mass for each, which results in interesting decisions. After each revelation, effects happen, then pick up chits (usually VPs). After a round of 6 cards is done, another subset of cards gets dealt out with different effects, and played out, and then the game is played a third time, again with different effects. Meaning each round is the same (bad) but different (good) due to the changing nature of the effects. The game's replayability comes from each subset being different each game, and trying to work out how best to play each subset. But that's usually overridden by how the others play their's anyway, so there's certainly a fair degree of chaos you'll need to enjoy. Playing the same game 3 times isn't that appealing to me - it's interesting enough if others feel the want to play, but it's not something I'd put my hand up to explore further.

Chaotic fun for 6p.

Have played this a few more times, both with 2 players and with 6 players and have grown to appreciate the game more.  Rating it a 7.5..solid but not a favorite.

The strength of the game is its simultaneous game play; the weakness is that it just seems to easy to miss little rules or conditions that upset the timing.. for example, today I played a card thinking I would be able to kill the character, forgetting that I was getting a saber to kill a neighbor, not to kill my own character.  

Having said that, with 6 players, the game was potentially more interesting with 6 booty on each day.  But in this game, one player got a big lead in the first round, and the other players were unsuccessful in attempts to gang up on the leader.

The game has a brilliant core - I love the character selection mechanic and the way your hand develops through the game, making it somewhat different than others depending on how you play it. There is definitely more design space to play around with role selection, and this game does it very well. The art is beautiful, the game is quick and scales well from 2 to 6 players (a rare thing!) and the inlay is rarely convenient. The game is smart and elegant - packs a lot of punch in a quick play and is generally very fun.

Yet a few things bothered me. First, they really don't have a good way of dealing with players choosing the same role. The random distribution of rank is very arbitrary and in a 3 player can get one player totally hammered throughout the game. It's also impossible to strategize around it unless you memorize the decks. Second, the theme is pretty thin and pasted on - the game doesn't feel anything like a pirate game, and I personally found the depiction of characters unimaginative, boringly stereotypical and at times offensive. Third, the set collection aspect is pretty meh. Not terrible and offers some strategic depth but ultimately doesn't really go beyond the buildings in Citadels.

All players get the same random set of cards each round, including the same original 9 cards at th start so you can track what others have used. During each round you will play 6 of them and carry the remaining three to the next round, getting 6 new cards each (again the same ones). Each player chooses a card and they are placed in number order, then day time events occur by increasing number, evening events by decreasing number as well as token selection and there are special night events that occur after each card play and weekly events for the end of each round. It plays fast but the combos are not obvious and since everyone knows what you have there is a lot to think about. But it is a little annoying as you kind of randomly select cards since so much can happen based on others cards and there are some obvious combos everyone will try.

Libertalia is a simultaneous role selection game in which one player chooses a group of cards that will be available to each player during a round.  Cards have a numeric strength and special card text that can do a variety of things.  Cards are revealed and executed in numerical order, and the highest value card remaining gets their first choice of that round's treasure (which can be good or bad).  This felt a little like a more strategic 6 nimmt!, as you had to try to figure out what other people would do and place yourself correctly in the queue.  Adding to this was that you know what everyone else has, so you need to judge the order of your card plays versus everyone else's.  I'm usually not big on SAS, but this one just worked for me.

I really like this game but I am unsure if it has a runaway leader problem or a problem with the sub ranking of cards.

An excellent game that I always like to get on the table so I can test the above hypothesis.

12/11/12 - Interesting game. I like that it plays 6 players and the downtime is minimal. The mechanics also make your brain think a different way. I think I'll probably bump this up when I get a 6 player game going. (Rating: 7.5)

12/25/12 - Just played a 3 player game and it was a lot more fun than I expected. I bumped it up to an 8.

3/11/13 - I've been playing this online a lot and it seems like it's cool. The game group likes it. I think it's a great filler game.

I've got to play this at my local meetup. BGGers have been recommending this game so I've thought to give it a try. I am glad that I did. This is as euro as it can be for me for a pirate theme game. But theme doesn't break a deal for me on board games. I can feel this is For Sale without the auction part met with Citadels (for the role selection part). The game is pretty fun. Sometimes your plan gets foiled by some of the nastier cards and treasure tiles in there. I can't believe a 45 minute on the box game took 2 hours for us to play a 6-player game with one teacher. The game is a bit too random and too long for that. For those who likes double thinking games, this is something to look into. Oh, and the rulebook is a mess. Not a lot of situations were definitive from the rule book so we have to house rule some to get the game going.

I liked this game. But when you play this, don't expect a Vasco da Gama, just take the ride of a family game where there can be a little chaos as the characters are chosen from the different players. But as everybody gets at the start of a round the same characters, you can make some sort of estimation of what is possible.

OK game. Quite abstract -- that is, it doesn't really feel like you're a pirate or doing pirate-y things. It's advantages are that it's quick, and easy to learn. I think there are other games I'd rather play that this, though, no matter how many people we had.

This is a mind game style board game. It's like a board game form of poker. 

The rules are easy, but the gameplay has lots of depth.

You're trying to out guess your opponents to achieve victory by playing your cards like chess and poker. Every characters have different abilities, but all the players can have access to all the same characters available.

It is not a blind bidding game like many people might think.

Every move could be well thought out. The more people play, more chaotic it gets... so I would recommend this game from 2 to 4 players if you want competitive matches.

Components are fantastic and the mechanic is ingeniously designed.

A fantastic game that I can't get enough of.

RATING: 6
In this game, each player gets a deck of 30 pirates, and then 9 are selected and everyone gets a hand of those 9. Then 6 times, players play a card at the same time, and cards are resolved in number order. The cards punch each other, hurt you, hurt other players, ect. Then in reverse number order you grab a treasure from the pool of available. The sucky treasures are cursed for minus points, so grabbing last is bad. Then you carry over the 3 extra cards you didn't play into the next round and everyone gets 9 more cards that again are all the same.

All this works out to be a sort of interesting game where you are building your hand round to round and trying to predict other player's strategies. The game can have downtime issues with analysis paralysis players and a lot of turns can come down to tiebreakers, which are all or nothing depending on the tiebreaker number of your card, which are all different based on player color on otherwise symetrical cards. It's also hard to plan between rounds as you only carry 3 cards into subsequent rounds and you don't know what the new cards will be. A lot of games like this do it for me, but this one just doesn't.

Libertalia is a neat combination of blind-bidding for randomised rewards (like the second half of For Sale) and special power/combo building. It ran a little long with 6 but with 4-5 I see it filling a similar hole to 7 Wonders. The only thing I really didn't like was the way the tie-breakers work, which makes certain player decks stronger than others. Several variants have already been suggested, including one by the designer.

Hell yeah! This game simply works. Crazy things happen every turn, and you are rewarded for thinking one step ahead of everyone else. You can wreck yourself if you think two steps ahead though, so you have to be careful. Heavy strategy gamers will hate that aspect of it, so they should stay away. But we had a roaring time stealing treasure and killing crew members. One game I came in dead last by a mile because nothing worked out the way I thought it would, but the next game I tricked everyone with a series of clever moves that allowed me to win by a few coins. You have to be willing to not take the game too seriously, but if you do, this is excellent.

Very nicely done pirate game that actually feels very piratey - the theme is there, in production, in flavor text, in graphics and mechanics. Arr!

Each player has his own den, captain name, flag and a ship and obviously a deck of cards. Each person on card is drawn like it's an actual pirate guy and not some disney represenation of what a pirate could be. So it's not eyecandy - it's rough, dirty and quite real. 

The game itself is quite fun experience. There's a substantial amount of bluff, deduction and wits. You maximize your money by playing cards, using different roles and executing their action in a particular time and order. There's enough combinations for many games. 

With 2, it feels very strategic, with more, there's far more backstabbing and unforeseen outcomes. Lots of laugh and moans of disappointment. It plays relatively fast, so the game doesn't really drag. One of the best games that can be actually played with 6 and it get's even better with more (which is very rare!).

You select roles that have a high degree of interaction with each other.  You try to anticipate the cards the other players will select so your cards can combat theirs.

There are 30 cards total.  You play 3 rounds of 9 cards per round.  It'll take a few games to get to know the roles well.

3 scoring rounds make it a little fiddly.

I was a bit disappointed after my first play....seemed to long and random, but after playing some more it is much more engaging and fun.

I love it! The pirate theme is felt, and I love how everyone's hand diverges as the game progresses. I love the role selection and the fact that everyone starts with the same hand.

2-6 players, best with 4;  45 min; Medium light depth, perfect to pull out for a mix of gamers and non gamers alike. The complete information provided makes for interesting mind games, plays quick and doesn't overstay its welcome. 
LIKE: the mechanism of trying to guess what your opponents play when the treasures come up. the game makes more sense when described as a "bad things always happen" game, which works with pirate theme.
DISLIKE: A mean game. The game can swing a lot, and players gang up occasionally. Can be frustrating for some.

August 2012 - Had a 5 player game.  Reminded me slightly of citadels with the role selection. Rules seemed straight forward and game play was quick. It's certainly the type of game I enjoy playing and the randomness of the crew selection would keep it fresh.

July 2013 - Only played a handful of times and either the game has been a real blast or felt like it outstayed its welcome.  Undecided.

Very enjoyable light game with plenty of card combos to think through and many ways to screw the other players - but of course you have to watch that you don't end up on the wrong end of anything yourself!

(-) At high player counts, it does tend to feel more chaotic and so becoming harder to predict opponent's card choices.

i love the idea of this game (as i did when i playtested a PnP version a long while back) but i would have preferred to see it kept as a quick 6pl filler sub 20q game than a blown-up 30q+ game - the cost seriously puts me off as it is just a light card game at heart and the board adds nothing.

after 1 6pl game albeit with some rule errors i still like the idea but a lot of the characters just arent that interesting and it boils down to maths too often which is a shame cos this kinda game shld be much more about the fun not the counting.

having said that the balance between managing ur own hand and 2nd guessing others feels spot on and for this alone i will be happy to play again it could have been so much more tho i feel

I had wanted to like it, but it has really left a bad taste in my mouth.  It was so bad the 4th play that we stopped at the end of the 2nd round - even the leader (my wife) had no interest in continuing and immediately said "Let's trade it."  There are really no catch-up mechanics, so if a player screws up 2nd guessing their opponents, playing their cards in a poor order, they can basically be out of it, having to play through 1 or 2 more rounds with no chance to win.  The pirate theme feels totally pasted on - there's very little that's intuitive to the card abilities.  No one ever goes "Oh, of course that would be that character's ability."  I still much prefer Citadels (but playing only to 6 or 7 buildings) since you have some information to go on about what cards your opponents are going to play (and they know what information they are providing you, so they can try to make unexpected choices).

I really enjoy this game for how fast it  seems to play and  how much interaction this game has.  In Libertalia you are trying to recruit the best crew to plunder a captured vessel. However the other players are attempting to do the same thing. The object of the game is to be able to anticipate what the other players are going to play and outwit them. The game is very unique and quick since everyone plays at the same time. 

Pros: extremely Fun theme, Beautifully produced.Fast playing timeframe. Simultaneous play with no down time.

Really fun and interesting role selection game. Players have to try to find good/interesting strategy while not being too obvious and also anticipating other players strategy. It is always funny when you mess with another player plans. 
Even if you might think the best card to play is obvious, the charm of the game is that usually if you play this card you risk to have bad suprises (because everyone have the same cards). Therefore, it forces you to search for more original or risky strategies.

Works well with 3, 4 and 5 players. Even though it is little more chaotic with 5 players.

I bought this at a cafe immediately after playing it for the first time.  There's something about this game that makes it incredibly playable, for lack of a better term.  I have yet to play this and have any player come out of it disappointed in the game.  I like the way the game begins with everyone's hand (almost) equal, and clearly about prediction based on that common knowledge, but gradually the state changes as people keep different cards from campaign to campaign.  It's got elements which are very much "take-that", yet most moves never feel bad, perhaps because you know each player might have looked at those same cards in their own hand and considered doing the same thing.  Everything about this game is just likable, right down to its comfortable playing time.

Arrrrrh! Fast & good game. Choosing from 30 different character cards isn't often so easy but it makes a lot of fun. Thematically a bull's eye!

EDIT: Traded it for an "Escape" bundle. I have to say: I would prefer the lighter game "Grimoria" instead of this pirate box.

Saw this advertised as "citadels, but more fun on BGG" and it delivered.  I think I prefer the online edition to avoid the extra time it takes to get all the cards together.  Im glad some in my group owns it but I wouldnt say it is a must buy since it tends to run long at higher player counts.

For me, it's the best game of 2012 and I am not even a fan of this genre. I view it as a much, much better - albeit more complicated - Citadels. It has role selection, negative interaction and player induced chaos. However, it has no downtime as players choose their roles at the same time, no losing your turn, it's much quicker (under 90 minutes even with 6 slower players), much less random (every player has the same role set from which to choose) and provides meaningful, difficult decisions. The pirate theme and great artwork is a bonus - heartily recommended!

This is what Citadels should have been. I like that you have all of the same cards to play, but which ones you keep between rounds will vary, which leads to asymmetric abilities in the later campaigns. The character abilities are fairly interesting, and there is a good amount of diversity between them.

I expected this to be a Citadels style game, this was what the initial buzz was all about [i]"Citadels, but better" [/i]. And I like Citadels and similar double-think role selection games (Meuterer, Havana). 

After 4 plays I can say, this is more along the line of [i]"Citadels, but gamier"[/i] and frankly not as good. 

You have 30 roles (oh my) and everybody starts with the same 9 of them, play 6, transfer 3 to next round ("randomness") and everyone adds the same 6 new roles for the 2nd round. Repeat the process for the 3rd round.  

Problem is that:
First thing that comes forward is managing your engine of cards. The cards have positive and negative synergies and you'll stare at your hand at beginning of each round wondering how to make best use of it.
Second thing that comes fore is blind bidding aspect when you try to calculate which things you can get in a turn and which you can get in the round, concerning your plans. 
Double thinking is buried somewhere deep deep down and repeated plays have so far not shown a promise that it can come into the foreground. 

Interaction does happen, but mostly via sword tokens and roles that can kill other roles - and double think also happens with those prominent roles (maybe 4 out of 30). So at its best this is a VP engine game meets blind bidding in a form of role selection. The double thinking and bluffing of Citaleds this is not. The fact that female gamers tend to win this game - as they do most of blind bidding games - confirm that blind bidding element exists (but us males are too dumb to get it).

I like it, but it's a bit too much juggling of game pieces as opposed to direct interaction. And also the theme doesn't really shine through.

A decently fun game based around variable player powers. However, unlike the simpler and similar Citadels, this game is going to be brutal on any new players in a group of experienced players. Note: This happened to me. But, the more you familiarize yourself with the character's abilities and the combos that can accrue, the better the outcome will be.

Simultaneous action selection! Character powers! This plays up to 6 people and adding more people doesn't drag the game out as you are all playing at the same time. Everyone has the option to play the exact same characters in this game, but the ones you select and the order you choose to play them in makes all the difference. There are also some built in ways to mess with your opponents.

This game is a little too random.  With 6 it also runs longer than it feels like it should.  This could be just first play time concerns though.  I feel citadels does what this game is trying to do but better.  In citadels there is more deduction possible as with the district builds you have enough info to determine your opponents motivations.  My biggest complaint is being limited to attacking only the person on my left or right.

Magasan jegyzett játék, jó kritikákkal. Nagy várakozással ültem le hozzá és elég nagyot csalódtam. Egy Castle of all Seasonst kaptam kalóz köntösbe csomagolva. Sima szerepválasztós játék, amiben két érdekesség van csupán. Az egyik, hogy a 30 szerepkártya közül pár minden játékban kimarad, ezért mindig változó egy-egy játék menete, illetve az, hogy a szerepeknek van rögtön létrejövő hatása, kör végén létrejövő, illetve többször létrejövő hatása is. Van persze konfrontáció is rendesen. A kombót szeretőknek biztosan tetszeni fog, nekem nem igazán jött be. Kicsit talán hosszabb is, mint kellene. Valahogy ezek nem nekem valók.

Pirates. Really good. All secretly place one card, and the highest card goes first, choosing a booty. Each card also has an ability, that can give you points, punish opponents, take extra booties and generally muck things about. Played over three rounds, and cards gets randomly chosen for each round, so every game very different, as well as the players not necessarily knowing what card each opponent holds, as you don't play all cards during each round.

Very enjoyable game - played a lot on line too.

What you imagine: A light pirate-themed role selection game that can be played in 30-45 minutes.  Yarr!

In reality: Players sit around silently for 3-5 minutes in AP each turn over-thinking their next move, cards are finally revealed, everybody ends up playing the same card, things don't go as anybody expects.  Repeat 17 more times, resulting in a game taking 75-90 minutes that is too chaotic and "take that" for that amount of time.

Solid role-selection game. It's cool how you each get the same set of cards, but over time they cycle in and out of your hand such that each player has different cards available. With an up-and-then-down way of resolving the cards, it's never just as simple as playing your highest card, plus the treasures vary enough that you have some interesting choices of what to go after as each week evolves.

Libertalia is a well-designed role selection game that traces its lineage to Citadels. It fixes the biggest problems with Citadels--downtime and excessive length--by having players choose roles simultaneously and by keeping things moving through a set number of rounds.

Having said that, I'm not nearly as taken with it. Whereas it's easy to play Citadels with a group of casual gamers, that's less true of Libertalia, and with more serious gamers, I'd rather play something else altogether. A lot of it is the simultaneous action selection, which I don't enjoy in multiplayer bluffing games at this level of complexity. It feels too arbitrary to me. Most of all, I don't like how ties are broken; if I had designed it, I would have used speed to determine priority.

RATING: 6.5
1 partial play (GenCon)

It's a neat set-collection, hand-management game. It also has a bit of Take It Easy (and Don Quixote) in it, sort of. 

There are 3 weeks. Players have the same deck of 27 cards. Each week, distribute several tokens across spaces at the bottom of the board (1 token/player/space). These may be worth VP outright, or lots of VP if a SET is collected, or kill a character. At the start of the game, one player draws 9 cards; the others take the same cards from their decks. In future rounds, draw 6 and add them to unused cards from previous round. Each of 6 rounds, players simultaneously select a card. Reveal, and arrange in numerical order (ties broken by unique numbers printed on cards). In ascending order, resolve daytime card powers. These could be things like getting money, paying money, killing a character, etc. Surviving characters take one of the tokens and go to "den" -- display in front of each player. Resolve all dusk powers (if any) on these cards. After 6 rounds (days), resolve any end-of-week powers, then score VPs for chits collected.

This seems like a pretty nice little filler. It even has a piratey theme, if you're into that stuff; I was mostly just looking at the mechanics, though, and didn't really notice it (!). And the mechanisms work pretty well: just like Take it Easy, it's nice that everyone's working with the same starting setup (at least at the game's start). I saw this first in [thing=2051]Pico[/thing], where that [i]was[/i] the game. Here, there's a twist since there are 3 rounds; the decks gradually diverge. But there's still a big psychological element, especially in that first round, when you need to figure out what everyone else will go after and when. I'm terrible at those games, but this could be a big hit with some people!

I fell in love with this game right away.  It is reasonably simple and quick to teach and play so will appeal to a wide array of audiences.

The game is played by selecting 1 of 30 possible roles from a hand of 9, using the role's effects and then following the assigned number of each role to select "booty" tokens.  There is a nice balance between the number on the card and the usefulness of the ability and once you move onto rounds 2 and 3 the roles in each player's hands change up.  While simple there are a lot of interesting decisions to be made.

The game also looks and feels great.  I can't wait to play this more and because of its accessibility that won't be too hard!

A very nice, thematic lightweight game that will play up to 6.  Strong theme and artwork can let yourself be immersed in the experience.  An excellent candidate for an end of the evening game.  It can have a bit of negotiation at times, and is easy to teach.

I like the concept, it seems it will get even better the more you play and the more familiar you get with the cards. Pirate-character playing cards, booty, backstabbing, and getting out of the week with the most money/ doubloons- it works for me. It has a deck-building quality yet it is very different from regular deck-building. Played with 2, I am eager to have some tries with more players, think it should improve with more, not that is has to. Good game, nice pirate theme.
Now, having played with 3 and 4 I like it even better (half point up in rating), you can use your cards better, with more players there is more happening and that is BETTER. 2 is fine, but with more we are getting a spectacular game. It earned its spot among my absolute favorites.

Simultanious action selection a his best. The pirate theme is great, the artwork is great. At first it takes a few round to get into, espacially for new players. But when u know the characters, then the game gets so fast. With almost no luck and always new constellations (cards and loot) this is a great game for all sorts of gamers. There are situations, when u just get screwed up, by the other pirates, but this is also part of the fun.

RATING: 6
Players start the game with an identical* deck of nine cards selected from a larger pool, each of which has a rank (1-30) and one or more special powers. In each of the six rounds of a mission, players simultaneously choose one to play. Effects are resolved in ascending order of rank, worst to best, then treasure is taken, best to worst. Played cards go to a player's "den", where they may trigger additional effects at the end of a round or a mission.

In many ways, Libertalia feels something like a multiplayer version of R. As in that game, deciding what to play is important, but most of the game is in second-guessing your opponents.

It isn't fair to say that this throws strategy out the window, but simultaneous action-selection always makes control difficult, especially at scale. The major problem for me is that the treasure and card distribution is such that there is a limited pool of viable strategies, especially in the first round. Some combinations are boring and tedious; sometimes the luck of having the right high tiebreaker numbers can be decisive.

I want to love it, but I just don't think it really works. It makes me long for a multiplayer R-like filler that doesn't exist.

I was hoping for a quick, lighter weight game, but it always seemed to be a bit of a slog.

Great theme play.  Game fairly easy to learn, but will take a couple of plays to figure out some card combinations.  Good amount of player interaction.  Play can be tense at times.  Components are good - mounted boards (although scoring board warped), thick cardboard chits, cardstock player mats, and somewhat durable cards.  Artwork is above average.  Rulebook could be clearer and the wording on the cards is not consistant.  Game length is a little long at 2 hours but does not seem to drag; however, game length could be problematic with 5 or 6 players.

My initial reaction to this game was very high.  I loved the theme, the art, and it felt very "piratey".  After a few plays though I started feeling like the random elements of  the game outweigh the strategic elements. 

I think this game would be great with the right group though.

I approach it now the same way I do Tales of the Arabian Nights.  I go into looking forward to enjoying the experiences but realizing that I do not have a lot of control in the outcome.

Arrr, matey.  A decent game about pirates that forces you to act like a pirate.  You kill, loot, steal, or snub the pirates of the other captain, and everyone is basically forced from the beginning to have equal hands.  It comes down to skill, knowing what others might play, and playing your cards at the right time.

This was mine and everybody liked it better than me. Why? I don't know, ask them. I have no real criticisms for the game, it just wasn't for me really. I enjoyed it well enough when I played it, but never wanted to play it when I wasn't. 

Edit: On further reflection, I think it's because the game is too long while lacking real connections of the mechanics and the theme.

RATING: 7
A simple role selection/trick taking game with hints of 6 Nimmt! style randomness thrown in. The aim is to manage your hand of cards to ensure you collect the right tokens to earn you the most gold. Very enjoyable with plenty of options for devising a strategy though luck will probably bring it crashing down around you if it's not flexibly designed. On the bad side - Knizia would be jealous of how pasted on this theme is. 
Would happily play it almost anytime

RATING: N/A
Interesting game of role selection. Theme seems to be pasted on, but as the art is ok at least they tried to give it more soul than only the selection. It also helps there is a match between the characters and their actions.

Now, owning both Citadels and Mission: Red Planet, would this be good enough to add to my collection? Perhaps as a game in between those, as Citadels is a very simple game and this has more involved characters. On the other hand, it lacks the spatial aspect and 'wargamy' touch of Mission: Red Planet.

That being said, the role-pool being that big and changing from game to game keeps it fresh and more replayable as either of the previous mentioned games. Also, its short play-time means it would be a good filler in our play group. Will not go out and buy it, but if I can trade for it would definitely take a look.

Played it several times. Fantastic game! Incredibly accessible, great for new players or new gamers. Easy as pie to play and teach, but with plenty of depth and re-playability. This is a game of reading other people more than reading the cards, which makes for an incredibly flexible strategy game.

Arr Matey!  Ye be on a week long campaign, and on the day of rest a scallywag reaps their plunder.  But keep a wary eye out.  Yer mate is out for a larger share o'the booty, and will not hesitate to stab you in the back to get it.  Ok, so the game is cutthroat, obviously, and it is very easy to, even unintentionally, screw over your buddy's strategy by playing a a card that totally blocks him, and often times the winner of a round will have an embarrassment of riches while the looser gets next to squat.  but the game is fun, the role selection method is nice, mostly you will have almost an identical deck to your buddy, with just enough variation to keep things interesting, and it is always tense when it comes down to who gets that last booty tile or pulls off that awesome card play that just swoops you into riches.  It is just dripping with piratey theme, and the artwork and components are phenominal.  Shivver me timbers!

Paolo Mori is capable to switch between games design with a clever vision. I like his games and this one is the latest creation based over few mechanics well mixed together. Every players will pickup just the same 8 cards (from a pool of 30) and play one by one in the same breath. The game will flow in this way for three turns. Behind this basic idea there is a great depth of combinations. Give it a try and discover this beautiful game.

Super cool card game.  Took a few minutes to explain to the family over Christmas, and after a few gaffs we got into the swing of it (even with a tipsy dad trying to play).  Very quick and easy and definitely fun for family. It does take up space though.  Discard pile, keep card pile and managing pile...it can get messy with newbies playing it mixing up card piles.  There is a card designed to be integrated into game play so they could've gone the extra mile and made the card pile sections on their place mat.

On first glance, there is very little on interest here; the options seem pretty simple as everyone has the same cards, but as the rounds progress, the decks diversify and then, when you no longer know what cards people are holding, the game becomes interesting.

The method for ordering tied cards is effective, but a little anti-climactic and feels like a better option should have been found, but I can appreciate that they were trying to keep the game light and accessible?

It's a little pricey for what it is, but worth trying at least.

This game is fairly short, and plays easily and quickly.  It can look a little daunting, and teaching looks like it might be hard.  But really it's pretty straight forward once you start playing the game.

There is interesting interactions that can happen with the cards, and it is fun enough to play, but there are many games I would rather play.  But maybe not in the time frame this one fits in.  As a 'Super-filler' it's right up there.

Libertalia is okay, but it's hard for me to get excited about it. Most turns feel like "Well, I guess this is a reasonable play assuming I've correctly guessed who will and won't mimic me." Since hands will be almost-identical all the time, a lot of the depth comes from getting a good read off another player, rather than interesting card or rule interactions.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Clever in that it does not overwhelm the players with too many special card interactions at the same time.  There is some good player interaction as well.  

There are about 2-3 good options in any given hand.  Sometimes there are a couple of cards that are simply bad options--those can be held off in the ending 3 cards and they may come in handy in a different round.

Overall my wife said she likes it, so I'm keeping it.  It will be much better with more than 2 players--I'm sure.

I'll concede that Libertalia might be better with fewer players, but my session with 6 players was a disaster. With so many people selecting cards with special powers, it's basically random whether your selected role ends up succeeding or doing nothing at all. Player control is practically non-existent and many cards limit take-that powers to neighboring players, meaning that even those struggling at the back of the pack get picked on. I found this neither fun nor interesting and doubt I'll give the game a second chance even with fewer players.

It's sort of like a souped up version of Citadels with the added fun of some wicked card combinations that can be made between roles, depending on which random roles were selected each round.

This is a static hand trick taking game masked with pirate pictures. There are psuedo bluffing elements but with very little at stake to make the bluffing interesting. Honestly it's unclear to me at all why they settled on pirates for the theme as they really could have used anything at all. I'm really not a fan of the mechanism used to drive the game, so I suppose it really doesn't matter what theme was used. I just find it an odd choice for what it is.

Played this game with 5 players and it was pure randomness chaos. I love the theme of the game and that each character has its own power. But i felt that i didn't have any control over what happened in the game. You have a plan but i never goes the way you planned because of the priority order on the cards. And you maybe have a plan to get that token, sorry you wont get that one. instead you get this other one that totally ruins your first plan. This game plays itself and you just sit and observe. It can still be a lot of fun seeing the chaos but i prefer a game that i have more control and that you actually play.

I adore this game.  It is pretty much perfect in my opinion.  It offers a varied, challenging puzzle as you try and outwit your friends, and gives great entertainment when your master plan to bag the best loot is soured by the  appearance of four beggars asking for doubloons; beggars who then return to your opponents' hands via surgeons and recruiters and then reappear at the worst time for you, hungry for yet more doubloons.  And then there are the Brutes... I will always want to play this game, it always pleases me, no matter how badly I do.  Everytime I play this game I know something will make me laugh hard and that is a truly wonderful thing for a game to do.

Libertalia works well from 3 to 6 scurvy dogs without any large effect on playtime. Each game will use 21 of the 30 cards in each player's deck, and each week's cast of character cards and loot is randomly drawn, so there isn't a single strategy that dominates.

RATING: 4
Libertalia's core game mechanic is a simultaneous action selection of a semi-fixed hand of cards to determine player order. Players with higher card draw will get to enact their card effects first while players on the lower rung will have bear the brunt of the card effects. However, after suffering through the consequences, players in the lowest rung will get their first pick of the pirate booty while the players with better card draw are left with the remnants. Such is the angst that Paolo Mori was hoping instill with this card game. However, in actual play, I find the game repetitive and somewhat chaotic and no way to strategize properly. It is true that players in the very beginning have perfect information. However, as the rounds go by, it is too tough and simply too much effort to remember which cards have been played by which player. Thus, one only has to gauge which card to best play for themselves, but unfortunately, this often fails as other cards on deck will undermine your strategy. This is fine for a short, thrilling "take-that" filler and not a full length game which quickly becomes a frustrating exercise over the course of 18 rounds of gameplay.

Another miss from Paolo Mori from me. Perhaps I too should shy away from Vasco da Gama which I had high hopes for.

RATING: 7
I am usually leery of games like this, which are centered around simultaneous playing of cards and bluffing, but I was amazed at how much fun this game was. Although I love the idea of bluffing, the Princess Bride aspect usually ruins them for me because you have so little to go off of that it devolves into a guessing game. The thing that kept this from being "just another bluffing game" was the complex interactions between the cards, and the fact that everyone gets the same cards at the same times. I like the push-your-luck mechanism of the treasure map, and the tradeoffs between playing a card and saving it for later--- for example, if the Governor's Daughter card is the only one face up at the end of a round, you get 6 points, but if multiple people have one, you lose 3 points. The tactics force one to consider what others might do, but still allow a player to make somewhat strategic choices. The tiebreakers are frustrating, but this is still as close to the perfect casual game for me as I have found-- good theme, high screwage, but still planning ahead and bluffing for those who enjoy that sort of thing, which I certainly do. Highly recommended.

One play at 6 players so far.  Citadels feel, both in role selection and in the amount of Chaos that occurs after you make your choice for the round.  The other players are what generally determines your end score, rather than yourself.  May be (like citadels) better at 3 or 4?

I feel like I have incredibly little control in what I can do here, and the resulting chaos just feels frustrating rather than fun.

I really dislike the uneven tiebreak distribution - for how important tiebreakers are, having some colors beat others 80% is ridiculous and unnecessary.  The distribution of low/high numbers is also uneven in terms of which cards benefit from having lower or higher numbers (e.g. Brutes, Parrots).  Monkeys are extremely swingy in an arbitrary fashion, based on seating order and numbers.  Lame duck situations are also very common.

I really really like Libertalia. Unfortunately I don't think my gaming group likes it as much. Like I've said previously, I am a huge fan of hidden role games and this is my favorite hidden roll game that's not a "party game" feel. The theme actually comes across pretty well in the taking of loot and it's a decently short and easy to learn game as well. I'd probably rank this higher if I played it more, but alas I cannot. Highly recommend though.

Really an ideal balance of time, speed and complexity for 5 to 6 players.

One hang up is that for this weight, you would hope it was an easier game to explain, it's really been a chore trying to get people to wrap their heads around the Day/Dusk/Night/Anchor concept.  The game doesn't really become fun until everyone in the group has played it a few times and then you can start getting into each others heads.

Also, I do think the tie-breaker rule was lazy, just applying a random number to cards.  There are better ways to break a tie that aren't simply attached to player color.

There seems to be potential with this game, but it seems to fail due to a lot of fiddly rules and no small amount of chaos.  I like the idea of everyone having set hands, with some variation coming into play after the first round, and the balance between the lower numbers acting first, and the higher numbers taking booty first, but outside of that, the game seems to be a bit of a mess of different mechanisms.  If it played more quickly, I'd be more inclined to be kinder to it, but with the full three rounds, it goes on a bit longer than I want it to.  As someone else in the group put it, "I'd play it again, but I'm not going to seek it out."

Great gateway. Perfect light medium game I would say. Seems heavy but afer all it's light. Light and FUN. The Earth doesn't need Citadels anymore - buy Libertalia instead. Meta-gaming and bluffing at it's best.

One would think everyone always plays the same cards - the most optimal ones. In reality it's not that obvious. Sometimes if you you wanna be one step ahead, you should make one step backwards. Sounds crazy? Maybe, but this game IS crazy. Good crazy.

One of the best games of 2012. Not for sad people.

A simultaneous play "combination" game, which is a little bit of an hybrid, since it is too mathy to really be a no-brainer filler, and it has too much chaos from what the other players are doing that can be approached like a puzzler. Reminds me a bit of "Citadels" in this regard.

A brilliant simultaneous action selection game with party-style gameplay, but dizzying depth. This one will really get everyone engaged and excited. It's memorable, clever, and you'll be talking about that time someone used their Brute to kill your Governor's Daughter at the last moment for a while to come.

Cons: Lots of moving chits and boards for what it is - the table will get really crowded. Also, the rulebook has zero errata whatsoever and it needs dozens and dozens of absent clarifications.

Libertalia is a clever role selection game, along the lines of Citadels...with a pinch of 7 Wonders thrown in. There are 30 different possible roles in the game, with players getting an identical set of six role cards to use each round. The twist is that you start with nine roles, so as the game progresses and different cards are played, each player will find themselves having a unique set of powers at any given moment. This creates some surprisingly unpredictable interactions that create some real laugh out loud moments.

The game's slick design could probably carry almost any theme, but the artwork is stunning and completely sells the pirate angle. Like many of the games I have recently started to favor, this one can be taught in five minutes to people who are barely gamers, yet it still provides interesting decisions and a fair bit of strategy to those that are more experienced.

Love the theme and the mechanics. I like variable power games anyway but there are 30 characters to play from (not all appear in each game). There is some 'take that' and some bluffing and out guessing and out manaevouring of your opponent. Works with 2 and I can't wait to play it with 4. My guess is that it may be a bit chaotic with more than 4. If I were to find fault then I would say the dens are a bit thin but I suppose it keeps down the cost and the box is a bit big - which is ok by me if there are expansions to come.

RATING: 8
Simultaneous role-selection games are really intriguing to me. It fits in with a few of my favorite game mechanisms, primarily hand-management and asymmetry, while trying to out-guess your opponent's plays using the "Vizzini method" (I clearly can not choose the wine in front of me).

Libertalia is notable in it's execution of this idea, not only because of it's highly-attractive production values but because it ultimately gives every player the same hand of cards...except that when they play them is what makes each player's strategy unique.

Every card is useful under it's own circumstances...but that's only if your plays don't end up getting ruined by the unexpected plays of your opponents. Not every card will be available in every game and you also don't know the order that you'll get them in, but you've got the same hand that everyone else does, so how are you gonna out-play them at their own game?

Libertalia almost feels like a "programming" game at times. You want to make sure that your program goes off without a hitch...and if it fouls up someone else's program along the way, all the better!

A pirate's life for me, indeed!

I had the honor of playing this from the very beginnig, since its origin as Canterbury, set in middle ages. I am very happy with the final result.
At the beginning of the "week", i am always in complete confusion and i really don't know what to do. Gradually the mist disappears and I grasp possible strategies. i am sure with more experience in the game this negative aspect disappears.
There are infinite strategy you can follow but u have to think them before any game and this gives Libertalia almost endless replayability. There's a lot of interaction and you can mean as much as you want.
The first games, while you are learning the characters, are a bit too long: I expect this to improve with later games too.
The art is truly fantastic and components are very good.

Everyone plays with the same set of cards, and that's what makes this hidden movement game interesting. Every round you have to assess which cards your opponents are more or less likely to play. By themselves the rules are unclear in places, so be sure to consult an official FAQ here on The Geek. The game has a good pace to it because turns are fairly straightforward. Also a lot of replayability because of the large number of character cards.

RATING: N/A
Up to six cutthroat pirate captains ambitiously compete to plunder three bounty laden merchant galleons in 45 minutes!  Seed the holds with booty, sabers, treasure maps, or dreaded curses!  Each ship takes six days to plunder with one day of rest to admire and score your haul. Each hold is contested with simultaneous card play. The trick of the game is the selection of cards by each captain from their drawn hand of identical decks of 30 pirate cards. That cheeky monkey! Expect AP downtime up front. Luck swings play a role. Surprising depth and thinky factor grows with more players.

This game has remnants of 6Nimmt however where you with the addition of set collection and character special abilities. the trick is maximising the use of these. Still a fun game but I wonder how this game will feel once I get past 10 plays (which actually says to me if it gets to 10 plays its a pretty reasonable game anyway)

Saturnalia is the ancient Roman celebration, in honor of the god Saturn, characterized by gambling, pig sacrifice, free speech, and the inversion of master/slave societal norms.

Libertalia is the more recent celebration of outrageously random tiebreakers by pirate geeks.  It's borderline good, which also means that it's borderline NOT good.  Mostly, it needs to be shorter and less tie-breaky.

It's similar to 6 Nimmt at heart: simultaneous card play with various rewards/penalties depending on what you played. But there are lots of wrinkles in the form of special powers which make the game deeper. I was surprised by how thematic it felt, partly helped by the lovely artwork, but the effects of the cards give a nice piratey feel. Plenty of scope for interesting card combos that make games different from each other. I like that everyone will see the same cards throughout the game, but that you could keep different ones over from round to round to shake up what combos were available in later rounds. Could do with some rules clarifications and our first six-player game ran slightly long.

A simple role selection game where you choose pirate roles from a deck of 30 (10 per round) and try and gather loot and prevent other players from scoring points. 

I kind of had high hopes for this one since we love Eggs and Empires so much. But, I've only had two plays of this so far, and The second one with 5 was a little on the rough side.

Not sure how this one is going to fair, would like to get in a few more plays before deciding whether it's a keep or heads to the block.

RATING: 7
After some number of plays with various variations of players numbers i'm coming to conclusion that this game doesn't live up the somewhat hype it has among other players (at least for me). Yes, it is a step forward from Citadels (which i dislike strongly). But it is still chaotic and unpredictable at times. But the most important thing is that i don't find different roles available fascinating. There are not several good choices in a round. You only have bad, worse and a slightly better choice every time, and often your better choice will be killed/discarded by other players. The game just doesn't satisfy enough to keep selecting roles and play. I have only played online, so i guess that it can rack up another point while playing with a live party of friends, throwing pirate jokes around. And it is ok, but not the most important part of a board game for me.

The game needs familiarity with all 30 characters to enjoy, which may mean a learning curve to overcome. Component quality is very good. Interaction is reasonably high. The order in which the 30 characters turn up in the game mean replayability is quite high too.

Main gripe is the first few rounds may feel like there isn't much of a decision, with many players playing the same character card and coming down to the tie-breakers.

I was interested in hunting down a copy of witch's brew for quite a while... so the similarities in Libertalia made me take notice and the great production quality made it an instant purchase on release.

This plays a lot like three rounds of the second half of For Sale... with quite a few card combo twists.  Trying to determine what your opponents will play is fun... deciding whether to use a good card for a nice piece of treasure or hold it for later in the round or perhaps even next round for a great effect is fun... saying "YAR!" a lot is fun... so there is certainly fun to be had here!  Lighter and easier to explain than 7 Wonders in a similar time frame make this a game I expect will be getting plenty of plays.

This game feels a little chaotic, which is not something I like, but the great art and pirate theme makes up for that. Smaller player compliments also help where you can kind of remember what people have and have not played, but even then you end up really surprised to see cards come out in later rounds that you had thought were already used. With larger groups it's impossible to keep track of things and involves more hoping that things work out than planning for things to.

Lots of fun and very fast. I'm impressed by the amount of strategy packed into such a quick experience.

Roll selection similar to Citadels or Mission: Red Planet, but with an added layer of second guessing your opponent. Very clever, very simple, and a solid pirate theme. Not hard to recommend.

It's good, but not great. I enjoy playing, but if I want archaeology, I'd rather play Thebes, and if I want majority control, if rather play Eight Minute Empire: Legends or El Grande.

RATING: 7
The play was very easy.  The decisions were not too taxing, and this scoring was typical Knizia.  Probably came close to an 'Einfach Genial' theme.  Stragely plays different than you think it would from the rules.

FAMILY, STRATEGY

Take on the role of archaeologists and excavate valuable sets of artifacts (with the necessary donations to your patrons). The game is fast and easy to learn, and I think it's deeper than meets the eye after one play. Some of the rules are unclear, so prepare to be flexible.

A Christmas gift from Maggie's parents (2010).

Recommended with 2-4 players. 35 mins.

This game smells "knizia" continuously.  It is the kind of simple rule game, full of little tricks of the evil kind to make it nice and interesting.  It is actually a majority game, but you try to delay the scoring of the areas in which you are the winner.  Scoring is also based on majority.  Not a top game, but a nice one.  The boards gets quite crowded and it is not so easy to see.

The rules of Ilium are extremely basic, I mean you draw a card and place the number of workers that are depicted on that card. You really couldn't get much more rudimentary. However the twist to this game is in how the tiles are collected and scored. There seems to be this game of chicken as players wait for others to take some of the weaker tiles before throwing their men out to score the better tiles. As a result, there is a slow build to the game, because the initial placements are so uneventful and later they will all be important. Plus there is a tough balancing act between trying to diversify and trying to specialize in certain colors. There are a surprising number of opportunities to attack your opponents, and in our first game the victory was decided by the selection of the last 2 treasures. My biggest concern with the game (and it will probably take a couple more plays to know for sure) is that the scores might always be about the same. Because of the way the scoring is done, it feels like there will always be a tight cluster of scores without many outliers. This manufactured tension can start to feel repetitive, but more plays will tell the tale.

A solid and unfortunately overlooked gateway Euro from Reiner Knizia. Unlike many of his creations, Ilium is not a remake/update/'improvement' of any other game, and the theme and the mechanics actually make sense together. The game is a bit of a pain to set up (but nothing compared to most heavier games out there), but the play is extremely simple. Nice amount of tactics with only minimal luck. I'm really surprised this game did not do better.

Decent game - lighter but does require a little decision making. Good for 6-8 year olds too. Does require you to watch what your opponents are doing and foil their efforts when possible.
Best with 3 players I believe. It's light, it's fun, and for a 3 player family game I don't know if there's a better one out there.

I get the feeling from this game that I get from pretty much any Knizia game these days.  That feeling is that publishers just say "Oh, it's a Knizia so we'll just go ahead and publish it since anything with his name sells."  The game is a very generic Euro-style game where the gameplay is only slightly interesting and the scoring system at the end of it all just seems very uninspired.  To top it off, the graphic design choices were pretty terrible and make it very hard to read board position.  Still, it works just fine as a game, and I can see playing it if someone wanted to since it's such a quickie, but it's really another game in the ever increasing heap of generic euros.

Nothing new here. It's basically area majority with a few twists, but the execution is solid. The rules take 2-3 minutes to get through. and it plays in under an hour, but feels like a nice medium weight game, sort of like Samurai. Update: had no idea this was Knizia when I played or rated it - makes me want to play some more of his later games.

Light worker placement/area control game. You try to dig for artifacts, but you have to do it in the right order to maximise you end scoring, and of course everyone else has their own agenda. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Area control and set collection.  Artifact tokens are placed in dig areas, sorted by value.  Players place tokens along paths between dig areas.  Completing a path allows players on that path to take one dig token from one of the two areas the path connects to.  Players must choose the lowest valued token in an area.  These are kept open so it's easy to see which sets your opponents are working toward.

Players control competing teams of archeologists, excavating Troy.  Simple placement game where players flip a card off their deck and place 1-3 diggers onto the board.  The diggers gradually fill in paths that connect two dig sites.  Majority of diggers when a path's full gives the player one or two treasures.  Points are paid out at the end of the game for majority of treasure types, and sets of different treasures.  Usual Knizia angst as you don't want to close off paths too early, as you are forced to take the lower value treasures available.  Feels like an amalgam of various Reiner games.  Quite light, but a pleasant 30 minute diversion.

Not bad, but not very new or exciting.  The theme is very bland, and the graphic design choices are not exactly the same as I would have made.  The board itself strains to be realistic, using earthtones, but I think this makes the board harder to use, especially when some of the dig sites are not big enough to hold all of the tiles without covering up some stepping stones.  Also, the color choices are not the greatest, especially seeing how the artifacts usually only have the color outline on top of a black background.

The gameplay is simple and has the potential to be very quick.  I wouldn't want to play this if I thought it was going to last more than 20 - 25 minutes.  There seems to be a large amount of luck in the order in which certain cards come out.  It seems like it would be better to have a small (2 - 4) hand size where you can hold off using certain cards until the right time.  Still, I suppose there are enough options up until the endgame for any of the cards you might draw.

So I'd be happy to play this again, and could potentially see my rating go up.  But it's not something that I feel the need to own.

con: 
- the artwork could be better (less confusing)
- it's a small game in a big box (with quite a bit of set-up if not played with 3).
pro:
everything else. It's a standard Knizia majority game, actually a tile-laying game (well, the cards and meeple could be changed to value 1, 2 and 3 tiles and the game would be the same) bearing some resemblance to Samurai, Genial Spezial and many of his other games while it's still different. It's not a game that changes the world of board gaming but it's fine - and underrated.

Euro-central. Each turn you place meeples to one of the little area-majority races that cover the board. But you don't want the ones you're in to complete first as they'll win the tiles with not many artifacts. You want to setup to be first in each race (to win ties), but not complete them until the end of the game (to win the tiles with lots of artifacts). Artifacts score both for most in a colour and for each 1-in-each-colour set. Knizia. Everyone's trying to do the same of course, so it's just a matter of who builds on which races as to what finishes. I can't tell how much of a good result is your work and how much the result of what other people have done for you to help complete areas of that you were in. Anyway, it's the same decision all the way through ... turn over a card to show how many meeples you place, and place them somewhere. The ability to do a double move three times in the game sets up some nice threats and some surprise completions. Even though it's not that long at 40mins-ish, I'd prefer this mechanic be in an even shorter game. It's ok, but wears thin.

Seems like the early game may be a bit random, but the end game will be very tight and tense. Scoring would probably be more interesting with 3+ players. It's a bit daunting the first time you play, so I wouldn't use it as a first gateway game.

Also, it seems like the scoring system only gives the illusion of choice. If all the player's are paying attention, the only scoring method that really works is collecting as many varied tokens as possible.

Reading the rules, I had very low expectations.  After playing it, I was blown away.  I keep having to re-learn that a game that looks so simple that it can't possibly work can still work wonderfully if Knizia designed it.  It looks like simple area majority, but the order of resolving edges between notes on the graph adds tremendous depth.  There is temp, collusion, and long term planning traded off against short term gains.  Even with the random draws, instead of the 'strategic' variant, there is a lot of deep strategy. Wonderful!

With 5 players, and perhaps with 4, I suspect the game needs 5 point 2nd places for the area majorities, but with 3 it's excellent as is.  Also, it's important to clarify a poorly phrased rule about donations -- your donation icon only affects you, not all players.

In general, the scoring does not sufficiently differentiate players, and ties are far too common.  However, the gameplay is brilliant, so I'm willing to forgive the scoring.  There should probably be a 3rd scoring criteria to add another layer of differentiation and strategy.

Update: finally tried it with only 2 players. Thanks to the smaller board and less tokens (randomly sorted out) this is as much fun as with 3 or 4.

Clever, pleasant and family-friendly set collection game (although not only my family liked it, but my gamer friends, too). As with Strozzi, player action is very simple, decisions are not.

Kind of Blue Moon City feeling: do you concentrate or spread your resources, or when do you fill which path to get the more valuable tokens. Tense endgame, as you realize that you're missing the wrong kind of tokens again and you are running out of cards. Although it is nice to have single color majorities, it's critical to have a balanced portfolio to get as much "sets" (one of each kind) as possible.

Ilium -- Played once; three-player.

I've seen this described as an area control game.  While I can see the reason for this, I disagree.  I see it as an access control game, where timing the moment you gain access to the artifacts plays a significant role.

The mandatory donation of one token to your secret patron adds interest, and significantly impacts play.  This is because the token donated must depict the artifact associated with your donor (known only to you).  Furthermore, the token donated isn't just any token with that artifact symbol -- it's the one with the most such symbols of all those you've collected.

To make it more readily apparent which paths had been completed, we stood the miner meeples upright on unfinished paths and we lay them flat on completed paths.  The problem with this is that the meeples are rather small and thin, making them difficult to manipulate.  Some of them wouldn't stand because of physical imperfections, and those which were lying flat either took too much space or required stacking.  

I would rather have had meeples with pips on them representing their strengths.  That would require only a single meeple to lie flat on a path-stone, with pips up for incomplete paths and pips down for finished paths.  If we purchase Ilium, I plan to make meeples with pips.

Some have complained that the board is ugly.  I don't see it as ugly, so much as visually confusing. The path-stones are too large relative to the space around them, and the contrast between path-stones and background is poor.  Those two issues combine to make the board appear cluttered.  I found it difficult to gather a quick visual overview of available moves.  It's not a deal-breaker, but it certainly shows some poor oversight on the part of the publisher.

Can't shake the feeling that Playroom are publishing stuff that Kniza can't hawk to Ravensberger and other larger German publishers.

This is an uninpiring placments for majories game. Players flip a card that determines how many meeples they get to place on paths. Once a path is filled, players get tiles on either end based on majorities. They score VPs for collecting sets of 5 symbols and also for collecting the most symbols.

Nothing special. Graphic design is uninspired and messy. There are other better games in this price bracket.

I watched part of a game first before actually playing and it looked dull.  After playing, my suspicions were confirmed.  Flip a card showing 1-3 archaeologists, then place that # on a stone and possibly one of four bonus markers.  That's all you do, every turn.  Throw in some tricky endgame scoring in order to qualify as a euro I guess.  Pass.

There are some interesting bits of tactics here, but--and y'all should know I'm not one to complain about a bit of randomness, so this has to be fairly annoying to have gotten my goat--the inability to decide whether you put down 1-3 workers really hurts any sort of real planning in the game.  That makes it largely a bit too light for the amount of fiddliness it has.  Just a bland Knizia with his Ingenious scoring.

Ilium is sort of mix of other Knizia games and has the feel of both Samurai and Through the Desert in terms of what is going on in the game.  It actually has a bit of Kingdom Builder feel going on in it as well which we found a bit more interesting.

It plays quite simply and quickly with an easy mastery of instructions and something that younger children could also play and enjoy.

Relatively short Knizia majorities / placement / set-collecting game. Simple rules, murky board. Everything is in the scoring system, but those who delay their scoring generally do better, as long as they don't delay too much.

Fun, light game - mechanics that have been used before, but still fun, and they usual Knizia scoring twists.

Okay game, pretty straightforward set collection with plenty of luck, and a few decisions.

This is pretty standard Knizia fare, but less interesting than Through the Desert or Samurai by a good amount. It isn't as bad as some, but don't go out of your way to play it.

Not bad Knizia game here. Points again for your least category. Some interesting decisions here and really it's not as bad as some of the comments posted here make it out to be. Never going to be a big be-all end-all game but it's alright and very accessible.

Part of the Playroom gateway series, along with Portabello Market and Livingstone.  The first game wasn't completed because I punched the BGG.Con copy and didn't count the pieces I started with first.  The game was five short on the yellow meeples, but by the time we got to the endgame, we just packed it up because it was getting late.

Nice game for a family, casual gamers, or if you have 20 to 30 minutes at the end of a game night.  I enjoy Knizia games and will play again.

The board and game play might remind you of Portobello Market, the first strategy game of this style from Playroom. The board shows a number of dig sites, with paths of different lengths connecting the sites. To start the game, you place a number of discovery tiles on each site equal to the number of paths leading to it. The tiles show one of five types of artifacts, with 1-5 artifacts on a tile. Each player has his own deck of cards, and the card you draw each turn determines how many archaeologists (1-3) you place on one empty space on any path. When a path fills, the player with the most archaeologists on the path collects one tile from one of the adjacent dig sites - but in each site he may choose only the tile with the fewest artifacts; the player with the second most artifacts takes the tile that the first player didn’t. As the dig sites empty, the more valuable tiles can be claimed.
\13\\13\
The game ends after all five tiles with five artifacts on them have been claimed. Each player was dealt a secret card at the start of the game representing one of the types of artifacts, and players must now discard the tile of that type that contains the most artifacts. The player who ends up with the most complete sets wins the game.

Nice light area majority family game. There is lots of direct competition as you build the paths and then try to make the most of different types of artifact tokens. It's hard enough to collect the tokens you need, so when you increase your number of sets and bump your score by 10 points you get a real feeling of accomplishment. There are many little fights over paths and tokens, so lots of little victories (and losses) during a game. Highly recommended as a family game for gamers! If it's all "serious gamer adults," then it's not complex enough to be a big game, and not quick enough to be a filler, so keep it as a family game.

The board is kind of ugly, because there is so much detail that it becomes kind of busy. Also, all the colors on the board are brownish and muddy. The cards look nice, though, and the little worker meeples are great!

Overall, there is nothing terribly new here, but as with many Knizia games, it is all nicely balanced and it fits together well to make a fun game.

Fairly simple to teach set collection game with a territory control element.  It deserved more love than it gets.

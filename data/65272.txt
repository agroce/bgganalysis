Does what it sets out to do perfectly, and creates a unique experience. This is not for everyone (I find it hard to get people to play) but it creates a lot of laughs if the players are willing to throw themselves into it. Select your players carefully and you have here a perfect party game.

Like another maublanc party game (good question) the scoring system is just arcane enough to distract slightly from the actual game.

But as an attempt to encourage rhyming, it's a pretty good attempt, and it steers clear from the 'pick the best' mentality of Apples to Apples or "why did the chicken?".  I like this (since I'd prefer to not have the players feel that their poetry is being rated against the other players).

be prepared for some complete doggerel or worse, but that should be part of the appeal.

A nice game of making and voting for poems - sort of a poetic balderdash. Style and substance are irrelevant - this is all about unique rhymes and voting with the majority, but putting it in poetry gives a nice feel to the game.

Because the whole point's to write poems,
And not everyone's well into that
This game'll be a hit in some homes
While in others it will likely fall flat

But if you fancy yourself as a bard
And should your friends all fancy the same
Prove your worth by composing 'neath pressure -it's hard!
And by all means purchase this game.

This game appeals to me because I enjoy putting together playful and amusing poems, but I really need the constraints of rhyme, time and topic in order to actually put pen to paper.

It's probably more amusing if players create their own theme deck to suit their tastes. One rip-roaring approach is to use a selection of the Cards Against Humanity white cards as the topics: this creates a game that is as tasteless as CAH purports to be, but that derives that tastelessness from the players' own creativity rather than the provided jokes.

Obviously this will only appeal to people who have a taste for the activity of writing silly poetry.

Think of it as rhyming Boggle -- you have to write a poem using a certain theme and rhyme, scoring based on using rhyming words that nobody else did and on guessing what the most popular poem will be in each round. The scoring is very clever, rewarding both vocabulary use and writing quality.

Of course, you have to be in the right mood and in the right group, and aware of the fact that the game involves a lot of quiet time while everybody's scribbling away. But if you are, it's great fun. Especially if you play it right after a round of Cards Against Humanity. ;)

RATING: 7
The scoring system is VERY similar to a game I came up with, though as has been pointed out to me there are primarily only two options with this kind of scoring; one person chooses ala apples to apples, or everyone votes and you award points for being in the larger groups.  So in a sense I like that, though I think in trying to remove the skill of poetry they have completely devalued it.  There is nothing in the game to stop a person from writing vogon poetry and winning.  In fact, it's rather encouraged.  That is a flaw, if you ask me, and I might rectify that with a tweak.

This one turned out to be great, while there was sometimes a bit of waiting. Let me be clear: You are actually writing poetry. That's the game.

We were drawn to this game because we love making up poems, riddles and limericks. We definitely have a lot of fun with it and its great to see everyone laugh and giggle at silly rhymes. The voting mechanism doesn't work well for us as a family with different age ranges and skills but I'm not sure there is a way around that. Still, we really enjoy it and it does get picked often enough to deserve its place in our collection. Fun game!
Update: January 2018 Let this go in favour of other games that get picked more often now.Decent fun while it lasted.

There seems to be a lot of downtime between turns-- we're not mean enough to force poetry from someone under the eye of the sand timer.
Otherwise, we get good results and enjoy things greatly. The scoring system isn't the best, however.

This is very loosely a 'game' in that it's more story telling, or in this case poetry. It's right up my alley, fun to write poems and hear what other people come up with. Great group game if the group likes poetry/story telling.

Some minor issues with the card stand upon opening the game(component wise) but fixed with some sticky tape.

Outstanding poetry-based silliness that scratches a similar itch to the classic Balderdash. You absolutely must have the right group, and preferably at least five of them, but - if you can get there - this is indispensable fun for a creative storytelling group in the right mood.

During our play, someone commented that they felt like they were in 7th grade.  And that's true on the first turn.  But once you reimmerse yourself in the notion of writing rhymes (more accurate than to say you write poems), it's a fun little game.  I don't understand why the minimum number of players is 4, though.  It would work well with 3.  Possible house rule: add one point (coming down the stairs, or maybe two points, one in each direction) for the person who gets the most votes, even if they didn't vote for themself.

[b]Best think-of-a-word game ever![/b]

I like to describe it as Scattergories without arguments and not tell potential gamers that they will be writing poems.

What differentiates this game from other games like Scattergories? You have to think of words *and* put them into a narrative context! This means you're using very different parts of your brain: one part that's filled with vocabulary, and the other part that's filled with grammatical structures and the world-at-large.

And the game is incredibly well-themed (a bit sexist though). You score points two ways: objectively (having rhyming words that no one else has used) and subjectively (who does everyone think has the best poem -- *not* simply who has the best poem). This second part prevents hurt feeling for those who are writing mediocre poems during the game.

I'm a poet (google me if you want :) and I found this game enchanting to play. An excellent family game and party game. The only issue I had with the design is that I thought there should have been some reward for writing the most popular poem, As it stands, you could write drivel with alarming/rare rhymes and win going away by being good at selecting what poem other people would vote for. By making yours crappy you actually increase your odds of making the right choice--no one will pick yours, so that's one less possibility. There is no reward for writing the best poem. I think that could be easily remidied by giving a rung (point) to the person whose poem garnered the most votes.

'Tis a rhyming game for four different foreign languages, of which we only master one. This game is extremely hard to promote, since it's about language. Luckily we still have got a group of English teachers, non-gamers though. They like the mechanics in it. They even rhyme poems to express their emotion on weibo from time to time...

You know what's cool?  This game was designed by one of my favourite game designers - Ludovic Maublanc - who I never imagined would design a game like this.  You know what's even cooler?  He co-designed it with his wife!  So what about the game itself?  Well, it's right up my alley because I really enjoy party games which require players to make stuff up on the spot, and I rather enjoy writing poetry.  So for me, this game is an unqualified success, and an interesting take on the "make stuff up" genre.  In fact, I think I'll mix it in with my other 5 or so similar games to make one big, awesome, mega-make-stuff-up game.  But be forewarned: you need the right crowd for this one.  These "make stuff up" games can be quite stressful for people who are not naturally inclined towards that sort of spontaneous creative writing, and this particular one is even worse than most for those people due to the added pressure of having to create rhyming poems.  For the right crowd, though, this party game should cause a lot of laughs.  And, while it's not terribly important for a game like this, the quality of the components is quite high, with the exception of some nearly indistinguishable colours on the various player cards.  Game design: 4/5  Personal enjoyment: 3.5/5  Total: 7.5/10

I enjoy games that require me to think creatively. This game certainly does that. It generally generates pleasant and often humorous conversation among the players, so that's good too. In short, it's challenging and fun and well suited to larger groups of players, as long as they up for writing little poems. Definitely a keeper for me.

I have only played this on the forums here at BGG, but it has been a blast so far. The combination of creative writing and a Boggle-esque (only scoring for unique words) mechanic for ending words makes for an intriguing game. I think that there should be some reward, like 2 bonus points, for example for having the most votes for your poem, but other than that, this is really unique and seems like it would fill the awkward niche of 4 player creative party games (can't think of many others).

It is a poetry writing game. You get a theme and the end sounds of 2 words, such as -ood (as in food, dude, prude) or -ove (as in love, shove, above). You make a 4 line poem using the theme and 2 of the lines must end in one of the sounds and the other 2 lines with the other sound. You score points by using words that no one else uses. It was cute but I don't care for poems or party games.

What an original idea! At this point, I seem to be striving more for originality within my collection than anything else. This game has that in spades, and, while it takes a round or so to warm up to it, provides lots of laughter and inside jokes to enjoy later on.

Buy from Boarders after playing with Calvin. Superb nice short game, short but not too short that suits our group. Too short's game is not able to satisfy our brain but this game kinda required strategy, combo and decide what you wanted to focus. You'll have to keep aggressive on attacking and same time defensive to prevent your money got taken by the pickpockets!

A nice, simple and accessible deck building, take that game that plays quite quickly but with enough small decisions to make it enjoyable.  I particularly like the cooldown mechanism of the hideout, which forces you to assess the timing of the cards you play on a turn.  Plenty of combos from the specialists or the decision to combine several cards to complete a mission.  Initially played as a 2-player game, I'd be keen to see how it changes with 3-4 players and whether there are enough specialists to maintain interest, but first play was quite enjoyable.

When it starts, it's very enjoyable - interesting mechanic. But way overstays the welcome to the table. The jobs aren't engaging enough - or something. Just missing... je ne sais que. Played with both 4, 2, and 3 players. Meh enough to sell after the 3rd play.

Interesting game with the cool-down mechanics of your people being busy for 3 nights.  The cards are varied and there was significant interaction with cards like hacker.

A bit worried about the power of the Femme Fatale, as it is really the only way to increase the velocity of the cards going through your deck.  It creates a situation where you can play 2 femme fatales and get back a large stack to then play for the next largest job available in the same color.

Un juego muy simple y repetitivo que no aporta prácticamente nada al mundillo lúdico.

Tras la primera partida ya no te quedan ganas de repetir.

No se puede decir que el juego no fluya correctamente, pero es totalmente plano, muy previsible y aburrido.

Eso sí, las ilustraciones están muy chulas.

The game has very nice art and some interesting card combos, but overall it just isn't a game for me. There is too much "take that" and not enough control over what other players will do with their turn. It is fairly fast and I might play if in the right mood, but I think this just isn't one for me.

A hand management game without a draw deck. The meat of the game is tactically deciding how and when to play your specialIstanbul or leader cards for the ability since the alternative is just saving up cards to pay for the job cards for points. Neat idea here but replayability may be low to average as you see all the goal and specialist cards in a single 4 player game and there arent really combos you are searching for.

Card quality is okay, no sleeving needed and the rest are not bad. Prefer this game over Coup.

I wasn't expecting a lot, so I was very surprised. This is a really neat game.  It has a cool mechanic where you get to reuse cards, but there's a delay of a few turns built in.  Also, theres the ability to chain cards together, reminiscent of the combos on Magic.  There's a lot to like for a small game.  2 thumbs up!

RATING: 5
It’s a hand builder whereby you accumulate cards directly to your hand and decide which one(s) to play on a turn. You play your cards either for the symbols – to claim “job” tiles for VPs – or for their special action to get more cards, f*ck with other players, etc. 

The trick here is that cards go onto a three-space track and will eventually slide off and come back to your hand for you to reuse. That’s it. Lots of stealing VPs and messing with one another that feels repetitively tit-for-tat. For a single play, it was OK but I’d have to think it’d get old fast.

RATING: 7
Grifters is a very welcome addition to the 'Resistance Universe'.  It keep all the simplicity and player interaction of its brethren (Coup, The Resistance) with the exception, that this is not a social deduction game, rather a clever game of hand management with a sprinkling of 'take that'.

It may not seem it at first but like Coup, as you become more familiar with the cards and their interactions it will become far more engaging as you figure out which cards have good synergy and that timing is everything.

You have two options on a turn; play a card for its ability or play a bunch of cards with the right basic abilities (Brains, brawn & speed), forgoing the abilities to complete a job; the catch here is you're not going to get those cards back for another three turns.  At the end of the game the player with the most ISK (money) wins.

As with all card games it is possible to get games where you have a bad string of luck while one player gets all the luck; even so there are always interesting choices to be made and ways to mess with people, the point is you have options.

I won this game in a Man vs Meeple giveaway. I don't think I would have went out and bought this game myself, but now after playing it, I am so happy I got it! I think it's my first hand management kind of game, and it was surprisingly deep to be so quick and easy to learn. The game opened up to many different combos and strategies. I also love the theme, and the cards are gorgeous.

A quick, beautiful hand management game! I like the ease of play, there's not many rules and it plays quick, yet there's meaningful decisions to be made and some fun combos! The different card effects are all really interesting, even if some are better with fewer/more players, but I guess that's unavoidable. I also like that most of the card draw effects let you choose between several options, which eliminates a lot of the luck that plagues most hand management games.

I don't think I've ever tried so hard to win a game...just to make it stop so I could play something better. And usually when I end up winning, I like the game more. NOt so here. Probably the worst game I've ever played - bad theme, no meaningful interactions (you steal money from people to win and you can mess with other people's cards a little, but there always seemed to be a better thing to do), and nothing to make any of it seemed like it made sense.

Grifters is not complicated. There’s no real innovation here and although the production of the game is fine, it’s not excellent. I like the artwork of the game. I like the theme of the game. I like the actual game, and I think it all works nicely together, even if I feel that some of the jobs are slightly over- and underpowered. It never gets too swingy, and it always stays fun.

Varias partidas en Juégame Store.

Un juego poco conocido que sorprendió gratamente a todos los que lo probamos. 

Tienes unos objetivos en el centro de la mesa, que te dan puntos para el final de la partida y algunas ventajas inmediatas, que para conseguir necesitas jugar un número de cartas determinado de ciertos colores. Las cartas que vas jugando, las recuperas unos turnos después.

Cada carta tiene unas habilidades y se pueden llegar a hacer combos bastante interesantes.

Las partidas no son largas y apetece volver a jugar.

Lo malo es que está en inglés y cada carta tiene texto... una lástima.

Played as a demo at the local game store.  I've liked everything in The Dystopian Universe (generally for  simplicity and speed of play).  This one was slightly more complex than Coup or The Resistance, but still fluffy fun to play.  You don't have a single role, but instead need to manage a stable of "character" cards with different powers and interactions.  As usual with deck  management games, a single play was not enough for me to grasp strategy.  All I know is that I liked the time management mechanic and would be happy to play again.

After a video review: There is a couple of interesting mechanics, like for example the delayed card play is like deck building games where you play cards and they will eventually get back in your deck, but in this case, you ca see which card is comming back.

Else the game is basically spend people to collect heist cards, get more people or more victory points. There is no much to the game, it seems pretty straight forward.

I think I would really need to play it to know if I like it.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
I finally had a chance to play. First, the "deck building" approach is interesting as it gives you more predictability and allow deck building with less cards. That is interesting for production cost. The double usage of cards is also interesting, the fact you can use them for their ability or their icons to finish mission.

Now finishing missions, is just boring, I also always forget to execute the ability on the mission. Else the objectives of the game are rather boring too. You simply have money that moves around the table and when the game ends, the most money wins. You never do anything with that money, so it's one of the reason it feels pointless and that you do not see your progress.

Another things is that there is a lot of unique cards, but all abilities are very similar to each other with small variations. Some cards force you to know pretty well the cards of the deck as sometimes you need to watch your opponent's cards. Many of those abilities have trivial effects, especially when related to money, you barely see the impact on your progress to play those cards. Compared to other cards that recover cards, make them move fasters, switch cards with your opponent, etc. And of course, some other cards are useless, or useful in very rare situations. Maybe they could have reduces the number of unique cards.

Still despite his flaws, I think there are some cool mechanics in there that could be used into other game especially the "deck building" aspect.

Eine neue Art des Deckbuildings. Gekaufte Karten wandern erstmal durch 3 Slots bis sie verfügbar sind. Dann aber immer der ganze Slot, je nachdem wieviele Karten da drin liegen.

I think I almost backed this on KS, but decided against it. It's a nice solid game with some good action. Plays fine with 2, but I think it's probably better with more.

Also, in a rare occurrence, there's a Kickstarter exclusive card (The Informant) that, despite not coming with any rules because who says a game should have complete rules in the box, not Kickstarter that's who, actually seems like it would add something worthwhile to the game!

A complete surprise at GenCon, Grifters somehow manages to combine some Coup-like abilities and random player powers in a way that I can really enjoy. I think the entire game would be ruined without the Mastermind that lets you complement your hand with new roles though. That's actually one of my favorite things- it's hard to get screwed over by the draw because you can always just get new cards that make yours work. I definitely want to get a few more plays in, but this is a solid pick from the few times I've played through it.

(3/17) 7. Really enjoyed my first play.  Very easy to understand but with plenty of variable, unique card powers that lend themselves to interesting combos.  Those interesting combos are further aided by the way that cards that have been played need to travel down the board for a few rounds before refreshing, which opens up other card power possibilities/combos. Also, moves pretty quick.  All in all, a very solid game.

(10/17) Drop to 6.

A lightweight deckbuilder game except you draw cards instead of buying off cards from a market.  Very easy to teach and lots synergies to work with.  Feels like luck of the draw plays a major part on how you will approach the game, less strategic and more about tactics.  It also has a kingmaking scenario if the game is close.

There's no real strategy or skill involved in this game. You look at your hand, read the card text, and pick the thing that'll get you the most points. Most cards suck and are thus only really useful for forming teams to do jobs. There's almost always an obvious best move, so you're really just watching the game play itself. Repeat until the jobs and/or points run out, and see who won. All in all, this game is a pointless exercise that I am not keen to repeat. Once was plenty.

Grifters is a clever little card game that didn't quite have the staying power in my collection. Set in the dystopian universe of coup and The Resistance, you play cards individually for powers, or as a gang to complete jobs. Jobs of the same power combine for more points at the end. Cards and gangs played are kept on the table moving down a time track before they can be used again. Interesting and fun.

I guess I am simple minded because I really enjoy this game for its simple gameplay and ease to understand the rules and play it. I also like the pace of the gameplay.
The set up is simple. The rules are easy to understand right away and the gameplay is solid.
Not a lot of ways for one person to run off with the game and there is enough randomness to allow for changes. 
The art is good. 
My one complaint is the hideout platforms are too flimsy. Need to have something a little more stable or stronger to use.
It doesn't require a lot of space which makes it available to play almost anywhere.
It is like a deck builder game but you don't build a huge deck and it is without a lot of complexity. 
The novice can easily take down the expert in this game.
I will find this one coming out to be played frequently.

Really clever system. Has the recipe fulfillment of a Lords of Waterdeep coupled with an interesting card-driven system. It sort of reminds me of the old Friedman Friese game, Famiglia, but on steroids. It's really difficult to find mobster-themed games that are really good, but this is definitely one of them. It's a bit abstract for my tastes, but I like the process of sending people out to do tasks, and having to wait a few turns before they return. And unlike Killer Bunnies, they avoid the pitfall of having to wait for something to happen two turns from the time you've played something. This could be my favorite game from Indie Boards and Cards yet.

It has some nice, hidden strategies and tactics that come to light after repeated play.  Not too hard to get started and the game doesn't take forever either, so it works very well as a starter game for the night or possibly a filler.

First game, need to play more. I do appreciate the mechanics, but it seems the design space is to small to really make something interesting with the specialists? Some are also quite complex, but doesnt seem to add anything from their complexity. Mmh, usatisfying, but maybe further plays will bring out more insights

Further plays: This is a decent filler, the main grace its that its playing very fast. Its a bit like Dominion, but way faster (and meaner and less tactic), so as a filler for deckbuilding fans, this is fine.

Filler with good depth. I like the mechanic of used cards that need to rest before you can get them back in hand and reuse. Of course there're ways of getting around that. Love the artwork style and pictures. The money tokens feel so soft to the touch! Has a take that aspect, but there are other avenues to victory as well.

I have had the honor of playing this prototype a couple of times.  This is a great little filler game.  Plays in 30 minutes or so including instruction.  You need to steal from the bank, steal from your neighbor or go for the smaller heists then go for the big heist. Quick to learn and very interactive.  Just what you need in a quick card game.

Honestly didn't know or hear about this game until Riley put it on the table, and that is saying something. I found this game pretty fun. It moves quickly and I just love stealing from other people. Trying to work out card combos and stealing other players cards to screw them up. There is a just a lot of fun things going and while it is take that, it is still a great theme and a game I look forward to playing again. I found it worked very well with 4 players. The art is just awesome! Really well done.

I won this game in a raffle at a convention.  There is enough going on for me to play from time to time, but nothing spectacular happening here.  

I don't like "take-that" games or "pile on the leader" type games.  This is both.  It's tough to be ahead in this game because you will constantly be berated by the other players.  There is little strategy beyond "pick on the winner".

Meh, take it or leave it.

While I love the artwork and the overall mechanics  of the game, there seems to be a balance issue for me as there are a few cards that were used repeatedly in the same fashion which actually mitigates a large portion of the strategy the game has going for it. Also, I wish there were more diversity between the jobs you can complete.overall,the game is so concerned with symmetry as a way of making it a balanced game that it actually creates a separate balancing issue. It's too bad as the game seems to be just on the cusp of being great,just a few flaws keep it from achieving it.

This is such a fun engine builder. The little combos that you can set up are really neat, and because you're always getting your cards back to your hand in a set order you can plan several turns in advance (and you'll likely have to).

There is a lot to be gained from proper timing in this game, sneaking in a heist just before your opponent can complete the job, or lining things up to steal a few more coins than usual from your opponents. It can be tricky, though, since a lot of your cards will get tied up when you go on a heist, especially late in the game.

The only issue I've had with Grifters is that if you can't find a way to get more operatives in your hand you're going to struggle to do well. It's a bit luck-of-the-draw, and if one player can keep getting more and more operatives faster than everyone else, they'll probably win. The other abilities, like stealing coins, don't seem to do enough by comparison.

A fast hand-building game of collecting a crew of criminals and pulling heists for money, then having to lay low for a few turns until the heat is off and they can work again.  Cards that let you cycle your crews a turn faster or get a second use out of a crew on a given cycle are very powerful.

一卡多用的小游戏，从机制来讲虽然没有大创新但大体还算流畅。卡牌能力很多，设计者应该是希望通过卡牌的功能增加游戏乐趣与互动。然而，对于一个小游戏来说，太大的阅读量似乎并不友好。更糟糕的是，任务卡平衡度有很大的问题。

This is decent, but I don't quite like it as much as I'd hoped I would. The cards seem too samey. I do have the promo cards and haven't tried them yet. That might make it a little better, but perhaps not enough to really draw me in too much.

I'm extremely happy with the art and components of the game.  Truly an amazing looking game.  I'm also quite happy with the refined (and obviously tested) game itself.   I'm usually not a fan of take that style games, but Grifters does it just a bit differently (which is a pleasant surprise).  This game kills Battlecruisers for me.

RATING: 7.5
This game has a very unique flow to it. This game does feel a bit like a deck building game with more control. There is some "take that", but in a two player game it is a lot of tit for tat. In a four player game it could feel a bit more oppressive if people rally dog pile on a supposed leader. My concern about this game is replayability. The deck of specialists is not terribly big, and I feel like after a certain number of plays there will be a sense of having done it all before.

Played at a con and was late at night, so that -could- have contributed to the negative experience, but it was so dry that it became the standing joke for the weekend.

Nice criminal syndicate heist game set in the Dystopian Universe.  I do think that the game goes faster and is more fierce by eliminating a certain amount from the "coin bank" and 1 color of job line as a House Rule.  One game I played was quite fun, but went on a little too long because we were having trouble getting to the bottom of one of these game-ending tasks.  This game absolutely depends on people engaged in stealing from and harming opponents that are getting ahead.  You have to be playing offense.  I know that's true of a lot of games, but it's particularly true of Grifters.  Find some people who are willing to play a better "Take-That!" type of game and give it a whirl.

kickstarter. It's an OK game, but in our first play (4 players) we had some rules issues with certain cards. It feels like a filler, but takes too long to be a true filler. Undecided if I like it or not. Edit: 2nd play, different group, and this playthrough went a lot smoother. We had 30 minutes of plain fun, shouting at each other for stealing their money, taking the jobs you were just ready to take, etc.

Not a bad little game. You slowly build up your hand of cards, similar to Concordia, Bloodborne, and Food Chain Magnate, and then you try to setup combos to get money (points).

One issue I've found is that the Femme Fatale is an auto-grab whenever you see one, and there's no reason to not play it because it then lets you play another card. It can also slow down the game a little as you play a Femme Fatale, then play multiple cards that let you copy its effect multiple times on a turn. In a game where the other cards mostly require some level of setup or a specific situation to get the most benefit, the Femme Fatale really stands out as a brainless auto-play.

Also the game is not good for two players, and I'll only be playing it with three or four after my initial game where I learned it with two. A lot of the card effects let you steal from all other players so those are quite a bit weaker with just one other player. Also, the "mean" card effects will always hit your one opponent, whereas with more players you can choose who to hit based on their score and the benefit you would get.

Update: Sold before getting around to trying it again. Between my own issues and what I've read online, it seems like this game could use a little more development.

Sold.

An odd one - I love the cards' double usage and the powers and the combos, but man is this a mean game. You are constantly beating each other up while at the same time trying desperately to get your deck to work, time your cards right and trying to foil your opponents plans. I do think the game is good, but I don't think I want to allways play it, as it depends so much on who you play it with. This game can easily break friendships.

Played a 4 player game of this with my friends and we all enjoyed it. The cards have fun skills that constantly gives you a lot of options each turn. There is constant interaction with other players in form of stealing points and cards, but this happens so often that you don't even care. So there is no actual feelings behind the take-that moments and thats a shame i think. It almost feels a little like a solo game in that way. There is no big surprises or twists in the game, it just flows and then it ends and someone wins. 
The artwork and graphic design is amazing! But the cards are glossy and thin. they don't have that nice feel to them that linen cards usually have :(

Many will find this too confrontational. I don't find the take that elements too harsh so it's fine to me. Artwork is very nice and the gameplay is fun if you like deck builders. It's not a deck builder but more of a hand builder with combos. It's short and fun with the right group that will throw up a banter. Good while having a beer or two.

RATING: 4
Hand building is always interesting and Grifters does it in a simple, satisfying way. The card combos are satisfying and it gives you just enough time to get an engine working without overstaying its welcome. I worry that the game lacks variety and longevity as a result, but thus far it's very enjoyable. My rating may lower with more plays.

Addendum: I hate when I'm right sometimes, but I was right about the replayability. The lack of variable setup and sheer number of actions that essentially amount to "gain 2 ISK" makes the game lose a lot of its luster. Unfortunate because the core mechanism is so interesting.

Take-that card game.  Draw and play grifter pickpockets, thiefs, masterminds, and specialists to your hideout and resolve their special effects to steal and screw your opponents.  Play sets of grifters to claim jobs.  Most ISQ$ wins.  Advancing cards in the hideout discard stacks is a bit fiddly.

This game was by far the easiest game I have taught in awhile, yet it still held a good deal of strategy and planning. It has a fun take-that style that I imagine will evolve into a much more punishing strategic game as players get more experienced and learn to count what cards their opponents have in hand.
Overall I can't think of a friend I wouldn't introduce this game to, whether experienced or new to games.

Each criminal has a different power that can be played individually, or the character can be used as part of a hand to complete a job -- completing jobs of the same color results in a set bonus, so there's a set-collection element as well. The individual powers can be something harmless like "take money from the coffer" or can be downright mean and allow you to re-order another players time track.  I do wish there was more card variety because it does get a little repetitive. It also seems to run longer than the suggested playtime, so we follow the 3 player setup when playing with 4, etc.

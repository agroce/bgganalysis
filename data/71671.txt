One play only so far. We didn't really have any trouble. Of course we made sure to take good actions, but we didn't break any sweat over this, even though we were newcomers.

So it's an okay game, I guess, but without any tension.

This makes for an interesting play as a solitaire. Once you get the flow of play, things move along at a decent clip. Playing without any of the "angry" cards or Ragnarok cards makes this FAR too easy though.

This should also play very differently with multiple players, as not all weapons are going to be available to everyone... which should make for some interesting decisions. I will refrain from making comment on this until this hits the table with several of us.

A quite enjoyable co-op game.  I like it about as much as Forbidden Island, though it is more involved.  It is like a tide very quickly even if one is lulled into a false sense of security in the first few turns.  I think, as time goes on, I will start to formulate strategies for the start, middle and end games, but so far, I really do like this and the possibilities it engenders. Nice art and variation in the cards, too.  I think that the game is ripe for an expansion.  Here's hoping that they do one.

*Rating based on one play.

Okay game, but very repetitive.  Takes longer to play than seems necessary.  Also, coop games like this where the goal is to simply survive until the end (in this case, a deck of bad cards is exhausted) are less interesting to me than those with an objective that you have to actively work towards.

I played this game just three times, so this are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.

I really enjoy Yggdrasil and in particular its theme. I like the whole idea of defending Asgard against all those enemies and even more the idea of using the Norse Gods, which all have their own special abilities. Also, even if the components aren't anything special, the game looks pretty good on the table anyway and it's very pleasant to play.

It's strange though... The game itself doesn't have actually a lot going on. It's all about surviving until the end by manipulating the results of a die. You remove Fire Giants from the bags to draw more Vikings to win the battles. That's basically the game. So the mechanics are not very interesting. The game is also a tower defense style of game, that is not particularly tense either.

So the way I feel about this game is a little strange. I liked it a lot, especially because it's cooperative, but I'm not sure it's the kind of game I want to own. I think that, owning it, I would get tired of it pretty quickly, because of its repetitive nature. I would gladly play it again though, when I'll have the chance, because it's a fun game... just maybe better if played every now and then.

RATING: 9.6
A ridiculously tense game if there ever was one! It's great fun watching noobs play this, because the first few turns, they're thinking: "Ah, no big deal. Enemy crosses the line, you clobber him. No tension here." Then you watch the horror grow on their faces as they realize this game is not a matter of clobbering an enemy: it's more like trying to stop the tide from coming in! And the more players, the bigger the nightmare! Just remember: don't waste too many solitaire games on low difficulty levels. Solitaire MUST be at a high difficulty level! Incidentally, this is the best solitaire game I have ever played...by a long shot!
Speaking of tides, Yggdrasil is not dripping with theme: it is DELUGED with theme! On just a few occasions, in an effort to make the game work better mechanically, absolute faithfulness to the Norse mythological sources is sacrificed; but most of the time, it's just astonishing how much Messieurs Lefebvre and Rabellino have tied in what you're doing with the actual Ragnarok myth. And rather than just throwing in a bunch of generic frost giants, each of the sixteen frost giants is taken (by name) from the Edda!
Graphically, Piero has created beautiful imagery; and little details, like Ratatosk the squirrel, scurrying up Yggdrasil's trunk, really bring the myths alive. It's too bad he left out the Norns, though. It's also too bad that there aren't any spare fire giants, Vanir, or Viking tokens: an appalling oversight. Don't lose any!
It is the most argumentative co-op I've ever encountered (and one of the best co-ops overall). So much depends on each and every action that players are constantly arguing for what is the best thing to do on a turn.

Yggdrasil is a cooperative game with a unique Norse mythology theme. Players are Gods (each with unique powers) trying to protect the world tree from the evil forces. Nice components and artwork (a bit weird though). The rules are a bit more complex than Pandemic. The mechanics are good and the game is hard but I think it lucks in replayability. It gets repetitive quickly. I think Ghost Stories is better.

I love this game! The components are simple but great, and the artwork is amazing. I am a big fan of Norse mythology and the way it is used in this game is perfect. Much like Pandemic, this game can quickly go from in control to hopeless, which is great because it keeps you on your toes the entire time and prevents you from getting cocky. I find sometimes it takes a lot of effort to push myself to actually take the game out and play cause I know I can so easily be destroyed by it. I also like how the difficulty can be easily adjusted to suit the mood.

Co-op, similar feel to Ghost Stories. On my first play (5p), early on I was finding it quite tedious but gradually I got into it. The tension ramps up very nicely. Ultimately a case of co-operatively trying to be as efficient as possible, and to divide tasks properly. Not sure I"ll be seeking this out, but would be happy to play again on occasion.

As a lover of co-ops, particularly thematic ones, I had high expectations of this game.  Unfortunately it just didn't live-up to those hopes.

Gorgeous board and artwork supporting the classic Viking mythology theme, overlaid with a game that just lacks any real thematic integrity.  Tokens representing the evil gods love along a track causing headaches.  Players try to bash them back using dice rolls with tokens to adjust the result.  There's also an element of managing and drawing tokens from coloured bags that just never really gelled.

While you often felt like the game was difficult, there was never any of the feeling of urgency generated in more thematic games like Ghost Stories, Flash Point or Pandemic.  

I can see how some people would like the game, but not me.  The decisions felt restricted and the actions simply never delivered a compelling narrative for such a rich theme.  Give me Ghost stories any day!

So frustrating, yet somehow still tons of fun.  The first game we played we were utterly trashed.

In the second, we decided to go with what is apparently known as the "white bag" strategy (figured it out on our own) and did pretty well.  Using the "transfer all cards" to a user ended up being a god-send (pun intended) towards the end of the game and luckily we were just able to eke out a victory.

Perhaps the designers had a secret mission to teach gamers the roots of Nordic myth.  Or perhaps they recognized that Nordic myth was a rich theme ready for game designs.

Egyedi látványvilágú, szórakoztató kooperatív játék. Úgy éreztük, simán nyerésre állunk, mégis simán kikaptunk, pedig a nehéz lapokat nem is használtuk:) Tehát így utólag nehéznek tűnik. 

A témája a viking mondakör, a játékosok a vikingek isteneit irányítják.

A mechanizmus sok érdekes elemet tartalmaz. A zsákos mechanizmus nagyon ötletes, bár csinálhattak volna kevésbé átlátszó zsákokat, ha már ez a játék központi eleme. A jobb fölső akció tetszett legjobban, szerintem még vissza fog köszönni más játékokban is ez a mechanizmus: választhatunk, hogy egyre jobb lehetséges funkciót állítunk be, vagy aktiváljuk az épp aktuális funkciót, de amint valaki aktiválja, kezdhetjük elölről az egészet. Nagyon ötletes a végfeltétel is.

Aki olyan játékra vágyik, ami nincs tele elcsépelt dolgokkal, és még ráadásul kooperatív is, annak tudom ajánlani.

Egy dolog volt talán, ami nem tetszett benne, az az, hogy túl egyértelmű, mit is kell csinálni. Bár... vesztettünk, szóval lehet, hogy felül kellene bírálnom a taktikánkat:) De az is lehet, hogy egyszerűen tényleg csak nehéz nyerni benne.

Nice game with good AI mechanics that can provide a good beating to the players. One of the classic coops where the Alpha gamer problem is there, you play a Norse god trying to beat back their mythic arch-nemesis before it is too late.

Talán a legjobb kooperatív játék amihez eddig (120625) szerencsém volt.
Izgalmas, és már az alapkártya szettel is kemény küzdelemre lehet számítani.
A kilenc világ adta lehetőségek közül nem egyszerű kiokoskodni azokat, amelyekre a leginkább szükséged lehet.
(minden kellene, de priorizálni kell!)
A tartozékok tetszetősek, a szabályok logikusak, és könnyen elsajátíthatók.
A szerencse mértéke teljesen elfogadható számomra, továbbá abszolút bele tudtam élni magam a játék varázslatába.

Valószínűleg 3-4 játékossal a legizgalmasabb, de 2 játékos számára is tartogat feszültséggel teli pillanatokat a cca. 90 perces élmény.

RATING: 7
Fairly simple coop that comes with a good looking production, largely due to the art design (good job, Piero). I find the base difficulty a bit too easy for solo play, but the game allows you to tune difficulty. The base difficulty was harder at 2 players (and I assume it would follow a similar curve for 3+). It's mechanically simple enough that I could see introducing this game to many different people.  The game nearly runs a bit too long, though.

Simply put, it's a good game. Shame it's out of print. This rating will rise or fall based on how a few sessions with 3+ go and the longevity of the solo game as I increase the difficulty.

A good coop with great components and dripping with theme.  While the mechanics are different than Pandemic, the feel is similar.

I usually avoid cooperative games, but this one was decent: I enjoyed it much more than Pandemic, for example, because of the theme, the graphics, and the dice rolling. I fear it could become repetitive after a few plays, but that is not a danger since we seldom play the same game twice or thrice a month.

All in all a very tight and tough co-op game, with plenty to think about.  I expect I will like this game more and more as I play it again.  Really looking forward to it.

Very tense and difficult cooperative game with a cool, unique theme and wonderful art. The game design is elegant and well-balanced, making each space on the board equally necessary and valuable. I love how the proximity of the islands is correlated to the spaces on the die, making it more likely that your enemies will add fire giants (or remove Vikings) from the easier-to-get-to white and blue islands based on their die rolls. A very nice design.

I have yet to win this game, but I think the challenge is likely to get me to play more. I have a feeling I'll be disappointed once I finally win! Luckily I can just make the game harder.

This is one of those co-ops without an individual aspect. When played multi-player it is a complete group game since there are no individual tasks, nothing ever comes up that only one player can do, and the character powers don't influence how you view the game, they only really determine who will do what.

To make matters worse, the game is pretty much about finding an algorithm and then repeating the same steps over and over again until you win (or lose).

On the plus side, it is very faithful to the mythology.

RATING: 7
It's a good co-op with gorgeous artwork. The game can be played on easy mode with no special cards and on a hardcore mode which is almost impossible to win. I prefer my co-ops to be tough, so that's a plus, but I definitely prefer Ghost Stories to this and with other co-ops like Pandemic on my shelf, it's hard to play this all the time.

Still, I will gladly play it from time to time as it is a good game where you definitely need to coordinate your actions in order to win. My brother loves it, so that helps a great deal.

There are a couple of downsides, and my main criticism is probably that it can get slightly repetitive (but I played it more than 10 times in a year which is a lot for me, so there's that). Also, we find that we fall into a certain strategic path: we always keep Fenris and Loki at bay as they are - by far - the worst enemies and can wreck havoc if you let them advance too far! There's nothing worse than spending all of your actions on fighting Fenris if he gets too far ahead.
Oh, and the artwork is horrible! Or... eh...

You should definitely check this one out if you like coops. It's not far away from the very best.

RATING: 7.5
Another fun co-op.  Easier than Ghost Stories, and probably on par with Pandemic, but with more complexity in my opinion.

More prone to boss syndrome than Pandemic I think.  In Pandemic it is clear what moves are beneficial, even to an inexperienced player.  In Yggdrasil, there are many choices for actions and it is less clear which ones will actually be beneficial.  This also makes it difficult to introduce to new players.  Ideally all players would learn it in parallel, playing together.

None of my groups have really clicked with this game, as much as I like it.

Step into the beards of the Aesir fighting to drive back the foes of Asgard and survive the Ragnarok.  The  randomness of the die-rolling mechanic used to drive the foes back is mitigated by a number of resources at your disposal to spend and improve your roll.

The game seems appropriately difficult and fast-paced.  The board is one of the best-looking game boards I've ever seen and the art in general is terrific.

1 game. 5 players. We won and seemed to cruise in easily even though we had appalling luck with rolling for battles (elves were rarely spared). The luck of Hel and Surt continually hacking the blueisland which we were not using and which often had the underwater token on it meant we were drawing vikings far better than what would be normal. Still the game seemed easy. Yet John said it was the first time he had won. AJ felt bored because as with many coops, it can become a committee decision and quieter players are left with little to do but follow instructions.
Rating may change if level of challenge and luck os confirmed or otherwise.

Egy játék után azt mondom: vannak benne jó ötletek, de nekem erős Pandemic utánérzetem volt.

Hirtelen vált át: egyik pillanatban még minden ok, aztán mire ismét rád kerül a sor, már az életetekért küzdötök...
Mivel csak első játéka volt mindenkinek, és 6 karakter közül választva elég sok kombinációjú játékok jöhetnek létre, remélem hamarosan ismét kipróbálhatjuk és kaphat egy nagyobb pontszámot! :)

Co-op with beautiful board set in Norse mythology. Unusual in that the board only used to display items, no player pons. Said to be difficult to beat, but different ways to change difficulty level. More difficult as you add players, but fairly straight forward with two.

Played twice at Essen 2011. Fast paced cooperative game. The limited number of actions available to the player combined with the large amount of options available, many of which would be relevant at any given moment, make for a fast paced, challenging and intriguing game. 

Whereas many other cooperative games suffer from a to linear approach (event happens, event must be solved), in this one everything seems to happen at once.

Also, the game gets tougher the longer it progresses - and it gets more difficult the more players are participating (which can be mitigated via some recommended changes in the deck).

I'm really interested in Norse mythology so I was sucked into buying this one without hesitation. The game does not disappoint! In the same vein as ghost stories, Yggdrasil is a game where strategising is crucial in the early stages because a few negative events can instantly change the course of the game without careful planning. I'm excited to try it solo. The game apparently gets harder with more players and there are options to make the game easier or more difficult (as if it needs help!). I recommend this one for sure. I also recommend you sleeve your cards because they will begin to fray around the edges.

It plays similar to Ghost Stories so if you like that game definetly check this one out too! The same artist who did Ghost Stories artwork also did this one's art too.

Very cool coop but without expansions it won't have the staying power of Flash Point or Pandemic.

edit: ...or maybe it will! It's nothing particularly novel (although it did predate the current 'bag-building' trend by a few years), but the art is great and it runs really smoothly. Maybe a little repetitive, much like Ghost Stories - same actions throughout with little sense of build - but it's more fun than GS, although I can't put my finger on why...

Players are Norse gods, trying to prevent the destruction of the world tree, Yggdrasil.  This is a fairly standard cooperative game.  Players advance evil (moving nasty monsters across a spaced track), then take some actions to try and beat them back.  Actions involve recruiting allies, tooling up with the right equipment, battling the monsters, and so on.  It's nice and tight, looks glorious, very thematic, and much more interesting to play than others such as Shadows Over Camelot and Pandemic.  Every cooperative game I try these days just makes me want to return to The Lord Of The Rings - still by far the most thematic, and the best.

I guess I've been lucky; all the games I am playing lately are incredibly good.  Or maybe we've just gotten better at picking them.  Either way, I think Yggd is my new favorite co-op game.  Too often I don't have the experience I am looking for when playing a co-op.  Either it drags, or it's too hard and over before I understand what to do, or my team doesn't really work together on making decisions to impact the game.  

With Yggdrasil, you have a tense, well paced game that makes you feel like the fate of the world hinges on each decision.  Lose a battle early on by taking a risk when you probably shouldn't have, and you change the whole game dynamic.  Get an area blocked off by giants, and look out!  Of course, it doesn't hurt that this has got to be one of the most gorgeous games we own.  All in all, a great addition to our collection.`

RATING: 6
People are right in that there is a lot of similarities between this game and the Ghost Stories base game.  In both co-ops, you must survive the 'bad guy' deck to win.  To fight the bad guys and keep yourself in the game, you must roll dice.  If you just roll dice you will lose.  Both games have methods of mitigating the luck of die rolling.  Beyond that, both games are gorgeous as the artwork was done in both games by Piero.  I still give the nod to Ghost Stories due to the spatial aspect, a few expansions/promos for additional variety and the fact that it scales wonderfully in it's player range.  Yggdrasil does have the advantage of a higher player count though.  It's supposed to be impossible to win with the higher player counts unless you have the Asgard character expansion.

A co-op that integrates theme nicely. Can get very intense in the later turns. Plays up to 7 with the first promo card which is great. It plays nicely either as solitaire or up to 7 players! Becomes repetitive after just a handful of plays. An expansion to mix things up would be welcome.

Really fun cooperative game that is has been a lot of fun to figure out the strategies for. One can choose to up the difficulty level, however the base game without the expansion is fairly challenging without needing to. The expansion is definitely worth adding into the game, as it gives players substantially more options from choosing between more God's to play as, and each God now having two ways to be played(normal and trance). This does make the game easier, but then you can just add the advanced monsters to the enemy deck, and the balance is reestablished.

Any game with a title that requires five consonants to go by before it gives birth to its first vowel has to be considered criminal, by virtue of its disrespect for the English language alone. Surely its publication must have required the breaking of several distinguished and respected laws in order to be accomplished, and one can only wonder about the criminal record of the postman who delivered it to your door. Even chocolate only has two consonants before it springs forth jubilantly with with the `O' of delight that accompanies its consumption.

An enjoyable game that can be played solo and is still quite enjoyable while doing that. There are lots of different options on your turn and ways to set up the game. It reminds me of Pandemic a little but not directly. Not that that is a bad thing.
If you have seen Thor or know anything about Norse mythology this game is a lot cooler. The art is amazing (although it certainly has a style all to itself).
When i was learning the rules I originally found them a little impenetrable in the way they were laid out. Once you have learned them though, the game really is very easy to play.

A thematic, co-op game of Scandinavian Gods (us) fighting the monsters (the board).  Plays 1-6 equally well.  Hard to beat.  Has 3 levels of difficulty, but we haven't won on the easiest level yet.  

Graphics attractive.  Set up a little fiddly, but not too bad.

Turns are uncomplicated and move quickly.  The well-constructed cards & board graphically detail the accompanying actions masterfully.  

Near the end of the game actions get a little repetitive because we are desperately fighting to push the monsters back, so there aren't many choices.  The tension in the game offsets this and the turns move quickly so the repetitiveness is occasionally a distraction instead of a concern.  The action track (one of 9 choices) was rarely used--there just wasn't time.

I have played this game with a dozen people now, and all said they liked it and want to play it again. 

Edit: On the 6th play we finally beat it.  (4 players)

Things that really set this one out for me is a big beautiful board. A game that's soaked in my favorite mythology. Easy enough mechanics, some hard choices and a feeling of inevitable doom. Its a co-op that has less issues with an alpha player and each turn the full situation must be taken into consideration. 

Things that I dislike are Viking tokens should be named Einherjar, or the worthy dead tokens. (that's a very small grip). It seems as you are forced to make the same 2 actions (of three total actions) every turn.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A solid cooperative game with outstanding thematic integration. Like with pretty much all other coops I have played so far, the action choices and room for strategic decisions are fairly limited. If you're solely looking at the game from a mechanics POV it's bound to get repetitive quickly.

Yggdrasil draws its appeal from the thematic integration and the tension resulting from the wave of enemies that is constantly laying siege to Valhalla.

On the easiest difficulty level the game is very easy to beat. There are, however, many knobs available to up the ante considerably.

An awesome cooperation game that fired Ghost Stories in my group.
Yggdrasil benefit from a deeper gameplay and provide more ways to tactically control the flow of the game (through the runes and the Vane powers).
The bags of token are a very nice addition since it involves to plan when and where drawing tokens.

A good replay value is provided by the card driven difficulty. 

A high quality game that constitutes a good way to introduce new gamers to co-operative games.

Another good co-op game from Z-man.  Everyone plays a Norse god, trying to hold off a group of bad guys who are threatening to bring on the End of Days.  More complex than Pandemic; the gameplay supports the added game weight, though.  The players strengthen their fighting ability by acquiring weapons that are between +1 and +3 against a particular bad guy.  You can also try for Viking warriors to help you out by drawing tokens from a bag, like the archeology items in Thebes.  Definitely worth a look.

An interesting game solitaire, the easy version is a little too easy and I recommend playing the hard version from the outset.  Playing just one God solitaire is a little boring, as the strategy seems to be mostly upgrade the weapons as much as possible, this usually ensures that you are not as reliant on the random bag draws.  Playing with several Gods solitaire means you can try several strategies and hence more fun.

In the end, its a very light game, when you compare it with say... Ghost Stories... but very quick to play and very thematic.

The map is beautiful and the mechanics are well mesh with the theme.  The idea of picking a different world as worker placement is very thematic.

I was very much looking forward to playing this game.  A Norse mythos co-op!  What could be more awesome?  Sadly, it felt like what it is: a bunch of arbitrary rules dictating how pieces move around on a board.  I didn't feel like I was *doing* anything.  No story.  No excitement.  Only tedium.

RATING: 8
My favorite coop. The board is gorgeous and the theme is solidly Norse myth. No over-the-top fantasy stuff. Play options are repeated as symbols on the board, so it's hard to get lost. Both players and the gods have unique powers, making it a well-balance exercise in juggling actions.

I dunno... I love the theme and artwork, and the game mechanics are pretty innovative... but I don't find myself just dying to play again. I wish I liked it more than I do.

Edit: After playing it multiplayer (first few plays were 2-player), this game really started to shine. Can't wait to try it again with more than 2!

Played on iPad. I like this game despite it's randomness and difficult play with high player count. Theme is excellent, I think this game rocks in solo play or two person play. Then it seems most manageable, because there is quite much random things happening in each player turn and low player count would allow to adjust plans faster.

One of the better co-op games. Also are the theme and mechanics well integrated to even please somebody who loves the Norse mythology. After playing it 4 times (with exchanged one of each cards to "angry enemies" (=2 steps)), I must admit it is really difficult, but a co-op game must be enough difficult to keep up the interest. I never considered playing it on easier level.

Pretty straight forward coop game. Nothing too fancy and may be a tad repetitive after a while, but in the end overall a solid game. 

UPDATE
Played this again with four people instead of three. The game doesn't scale well and it is harder more players you have. This was a good thing in my view. The game became challenging and was happier for the quality of decisions we had to face. 
There are also ways in which the game's difficulty may be tweaked, which is a very good feature. 
Overall bumping this +0.2 up.

RATING: 4
The art is very dynamic and interesting, but aside from that, there is no connection to the theme at all. I didn't feel like a Norse god fighting against the wicked, but rather like a European Engineer trying to get just a bit more efficient in my matrix. I was really disappointed in this one because I had heard it was challenging indeed. I didn't play with all the extra powers (which are the easiest and clearest way to make it harder), and I did play solo (which also makes the game easier). However, the basic flow of the game was purely uninteresting. It reminded me of a non-historical, and somehow more convoluted States of Siege game, but without the tiny footprint.

As a cooperative game, it is rather boring: mechanical, repetitive, and quite obvious -since each player specialize weaponwise in one or two bad guys.

But as a solitaire, it is quite entertaining: some interesting choices, mostly regarding timing: you end up doing more or less the same in each game, but when is the crucial point that separates victory from defeat. 
(The rating is thus for solo play only, as a coop I would rate this a 5).
Theme is a big plus for me too.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Art, gameplay, theme, all working well together to create a uniquely flavoured experience. I like it!

The art excerpts looked very saturated and overdone but together the game laid out looks quite striking and beautiful. Busy, but beautiful.

As for gameplay, there are a lot of strategic options here to play with, and plenty of challenge. My one worry is that, with games that have lots of spelled-out mechanics like this that gameplay isn't fresh and exciting for very long. We'll have to see how it holds up. (((edit: two months later -- no problems here, lots of plays and it holds up well))).

Trueness to the theme is the most striking thing about this game. There are plenty of games that simply lift the names of the gods and maybe a couple of the giants. But Yggdrasil has it all, or at least an awful lot more than anyone else. The mere fact that Gungnir made it into the game is testament enough to the faithfulness of the designers.

Overall, a very enjoyable game with lots of replay potential.

RATING: 6
Decent cooperative game that I bought only for the theme and artwork. Well, the board art is very good, but the character cards are ugly and don't match the board in style. The theme is clearly there, but yet the game feels a little dry, as you are just moving enemy tokens forth and back along a track and your character has no presence on the board. Most of the time you are taking tokens out of bags or putting tokens into them, and then rolling the die to attack. Except for moving the Vanir, everything you do outside of combat is to improve your odds at it. The actions are repetitive and not very interesting or imaginative, but there are still decisions to be made, and the players must adapt to what the enemies throw at them. Probably good for a few plays.

Küzdelem a világfán
Sok vélemény a játékot a Ghost Stories nevű másik remekhez hasonlítja. Vannak közös pontok, de rengeteg a különbség is. A játék maga egy kooperatív társas 1-6 fő részére, amelyben minél többen játszunk, annál nehezebb nyerni, sőt a Dühös Ellenség/Ragnarök kártyákkal már kevesebb játékos számnál is halálos a „gém”. Szívemhez közel áll az északi mondavilág, ennek megfelelően már eleve nagy kedvvel ültem le játszani. Alapból 6 Istenség közül választhatunk, mindegyiknek egyedi képességét kamatoztatva a küzdelemben. Az igazsághoz az is hozzátartozik, hogy közülük vannak erősebbre és gyengébbre sikerültek, ilyen szempontból kiegyenlítetlen a játék. A cél egyszerű: túlélni 42 támadást, amelyet a felhúzott Ellenség kártyák személyesítenek meg. A kártyák hatására egy vagy több Ellenség is közelebb jut Odin Csarnokához (plusz képességeiknek megfelelően más-más területeken nehezítik a dolgunkat) és ezt mi nem hagyhatjuk. Alapból 3 akciónk felhasználásával gyúrjuk ki magunkat a küzdelemre (harcosokat szerzünk, fegyvereket kovácsoltatunk, csere-berélünk, támogatjuk a többieket). Természetesen a körönkénti 5 akció sem lenne elegendő, így a játék velejárója, hogy megtaláljuk a legjobb lépéseket. Az Ellenségek is különböző erősségűek, érdemes Fenrir farkasra és Lokira koncentrálnunk, de nem szabad a többit sem hagyni, hogy besunnyogjon a hátunk mögött a „tutiba”. Maga a játék gyönyörű, szabályai egyszerűen elsajátíthatóak (azok magyar fordítása létezik, szépen le kell tölteni, ha nincs más lehetőségünk). Mindenkinek ajánlom kipróbálásra.

If you play without the cards that make this more difficult, simply clean out one or two bags at most, pull from them constantly, refill them constantly, and completely ignore the other two bags.  Repeat ad nauseum, and there really isn't much for decisions to be had.  

Pandemic and Shadows over Camelot both do a wonderful job of giving you a sense of impending doom.  This game just gives you a sense of an hourglass slowly plodding away with too few interesting choices to make in between.  Absolutely gorgeous artwork and a wonderful theme but an average game tacked on top of all that.

This is one of the most beautiful games around, and a nice little coop.

On a 1st 3-player (NOT solo) game, we won fairly easily- it will be interesting to scale this up a bit in future plays.

It reminded me a bit of Pandemic, trying to keep enemies off at a 'safety' level, but with a bit more predictability, at least at the lowest level.

I'm starting this at a 7- it's a good game, but not quite as quick and addictive as Flash Point was today, and the 'Thebes' setup of Fire Giants & Vikings is a bit fiddly.

Not only is it still fiddly after 5 plays, I also feel that the giants make it unablanced (no weapon to counter giants) - so I am docking it down to 6.75.

RATING: 3.5
Didn't like it. Neither the artwork (which might appeal to many, though - to me it was just overloaded) nor the gameplay. It's all about making a decision about what is best for the group, calculating probabilities, then rolling a die and succeeding or failing. If you fail too often, you lose. If you don't you will win. There is better and worse gameplay (read: better or worse probabilities), but it comes down to lots of die rolling. There are many, many cases in which there aren't many decisions, but many moments of "we have to win this fight this round, or we lose", so there aren't many possibilities of setting up long-term plans. Most annoyingly, Fenrir can make you lose entire turns to rolling a die. What's the appeal in that? I have no desire to play again (and didn't after my first play, but I am easily persuaded when it comes to gaming). I absolutely don't understand the buzz about this. Granted, it is thematically sound (somehow), but I felt... bored.

Enjoyed my first and only play of this one.  There seems to be more variety in actions and events than in Pandemic or Shadows over Camelot, which energized some discussion during the game.  Ultimately, however, it would seem to me that there is a dominant strategy that does not include some of this variety.  So the game might get stale quickly with repeated plays.  However, I feel this way about any coop I have played.

My partner and I tried to play this game at our favorite local game store. After the 12 stage setup process that took us twenty minutes, we went to take our first turn and discover that one phase involves us choosing three actions from among _nine_ possibilities.  Resolving any of them would be fairly involved, and since we didn't feel like reading and understanding the complexities of all nine possible actions, we decided to pack it up and play something else.

First played August 9th, 2015.  Good cooperative game for those looking for that.  Seemed like the game is setup for a good challenge. Each player plays a god that has a special power. On your turn you draw an event card and take three different actions (buy/upgrade weapon), draw from bag for strength tokens 3 at a time, elf special strength token, move the horses, fight one of 6 monster or fight an ice giant. When you draw from a bag there are fire giants that you don't get. Ice giants keep you from doing something on your turn until defeated. The 6 monsters progress on a track. If a certain number reach an area on the board you lose. Each monster has a special ability. If you draw all the event cards while keeping the monsters back, you win.

[b]Solitaire Review:[/b]

I'm not usually a fan of games with so much luck, and there is a ton of luck about here. Luck of the card draw, luck of the tokens drawn, and luck of the die rolls. However, because of the amount of strategy available to mitigate those luck factors, I keep coming back for more punishment, determined to force the luck into submission. The large variety of heroes that fundamentally change the way you approach the game, also adds a ton to the replay value. 

I might be enjoying the game so much because of my recent fondness of Norse mythology (no, Marvel was not my gateway to the subject matter, but working on [geekurl=/boardgame/157917/lord-ice-garden]"Lord of the Ice Garden"[/geekurl] with Krzysztof Wolicki). There is something very mystical, powerful and forlorn about the majestic fjords and vistas. And while the art style is more on the colorful side, I'm really drawn to how the game looks and feels. 

The challenge level is also easily elevated with the inclusion of the Angry Enemy and Ragnarok cards. And after failing successively with all of the Ragnarok cards included, I usually restrict myself to only including one nowadays. It gives a healthy challenge and the hope we might actually survive the onslaught. 

[b]Pros:[/b]

- The sense of escalation in the game is fantastic.
- The different strategies that you pursue based on your chosen hero, are varied and always exciting. 
- You can feel satisfaction from mitigating most of the luck factors, but there will always be enough risk to keep the game tense to the very end. 
- All the mechanics feel natural, working together well. But they are all their own quickly resolved mini-game, keeping every phase of the game exciting. 

[b]Cons:[/b] 

- Seems next to impossible to beat the game with all of the Ragnarok cards in the enemy deck. 
- I wish it was a little easier and quicker to move around the islands.

Fun theme. Confusing board design/symbol/rune system. Suffers from the same problems as most co-op games. Kind of like Arkham Horror but more abstract. Lots of randomness. Felt like a lot of the time I was just weighing probabilities - could really bog down if people took the statistical analysis aspect of it far enough. When it was over, I didn't feel like we had accomplished much - just run out of cards. Not sure I'd play it again.

Smoothly working co-op game.
I wanted to like it so much (it's _great_ on paper), but instead I like it... only partially..

There is nothing to complain about the mechanics - it's really REALLY well polished, but the game is not, in fact,  so cooperative - when a player gets his turn (=3 actions), there is a little (if at all) general debate going on and agonizing decisions are missing.  What to do is rather clear.
Climate is not felt so much too.

The game is on the verge of buying threshold for me, but misses it just a bit..

The game is difficult to win, even on the easiest level.  That's good.

Fun, flavorful coop. I love the norse mythology theme. The one negative I can think of is that weapons seem really important and so it's kind of annoying that you feel almost obligated to spend one of your actions every turn for a while just getting weapons. But overall it's really fun, it's a coop where there are a lot of things to do and a lot of decisions that are hard but feel fair and don't come down too much to randomness. We beat intro difficulty our first game, but that's ok since it seems you can really ramp up the difficulty pretty high if you need to.

RATING: 6
after 1 play, I think(?) it's better than ghost stories, purely because it doesn't suffer from the problem of players in ghost stories either staying on the same side of the board the entire game, or wasting an action moving (depending on what the center tile is, and whether the red player is playing the "dispatcher" or not).

Ghost stories is also a coop where it is always obvious that you are in trouble, whereas this game is like pandemic in that you slowly build up from start to finish, so it just feels less stressful (perhaps an illusion but i prefer it like this).

Very different feel from Ghost Stories. I was expecting some overlap, but this one was static, tower defense feel while Ghost Stories had a bit more life to it as you can move around the tiles.

Very enjoyable game. The Norse myth theme definitely helped me immerse myself into the game. As long as one person got the rules down, the game seemed like very easy one to break out and start playing with new people. 

If I have to keep one, I would prefer Ghost Stories over Yggdrasil. The spacial movement added another dimension of strategy that is lacking in Yggdrasil. However, Yggdrasil has its share of fun mechanics (drawing from bags, ice titan fighting on the side, and etc). Overall, very satisfied and will play till I can beat the highest difficulty.

After three plays, it starts well, the evil gods power increases during the game, we have to organize to fight them, roll a dice, and pick up tokens in small bags.

After several rounds, the game becomes repetitive and a bit boring, the goal being to avoid to overcrowd the bags with fire giants, collect vikings and elves to control the dice roll.

nice, but not so exciting

I really loved the game in the beginning, highly thematic, nice co-op, nail-biter. In the long run though the replayability is not that high for us, though. Once you have figured out the "right" moves it becomes a bit repetitive. 
I still like it though, my six year old daughter LOVES it (which I really appreciate, since she's usually all about pink unicorns dancing on a cloud :p ) and it's a great way to get to know the Norse myths. Plus, the artwork is really cool, the artist was clearly familiar with the stories, for instance Ratatok the mischievous squirrel is featured, although he's not an active player in the game.

This game reminds me a lot of Ghost Stories.  This is also a very difficult co-op with unique player abilities and an ever building sense of danger.  The game doesn't suddenly change directions halfway through to screw with you, it just continues to grow more difficult at a steady pace until suddenly you're at a breaking point.

Unlike Ghost Stories this can scale to 6 players.  Unless you really hate one theme or the other I can't imagine that fans of 1 wouldn't love the other.  Great game.

Gorgeous.  The one thing I would have liked to have seen is a more direct link between progress of the Giants and the progressive wounding and death of the gods.  A variant maybe.

This game did not interest me. I was at a gaming event and someone said "Do you want to play a Norse God." I said sure and was rather bored for the next ninety minutes. The choices were usually quite obvious. Either you had to fight the bad guys and try to beat them back, or you needed to improve your abilities to improve the odds that you would win the fights. In most turns you did a combination of both. The choices often seemed obvious and if the odds went against you, it didn't matter what choices you made. For people who like dungeon crawls and fighting monsters this might be a good coop. But for me, this was blah.

The first two times I've played it I won and I thought that this game is easy, so I decided to change some gods' cards and put in those that move them two spaces. I also added two Ragnarok cards. In less than 30 minutes my friend and I were destroyed by Loki and his friends. This is a very easy to teach and very hard to win game (ok maybe not that hard on the normal level with one or two players). It is also very short, because one players turn usually last about 30 seconds to 1 minute. There is some luck aspect in this game (as always when dice is involved) but you can manage it with different tokens that you can collect. The board and components look simply great and if you like the Nordic mythology you must get this game.

gracies a Coop-Land i es seu concurs de frases de chuck Norris :D

juego cooperativo ambientado en los dioses vikingos.

De estrategias limitadas y un azar importante, además de un setup engorroso (malditas bolsas de colores). Aunque nos divierte al ser sencillo y de partidas rápidas.

controlar las cartas que han salido y quedan por salir es básico para la victoria.

This is a good cooperative game that evokes a lot of table talk. In hindsight I think it is pretty simple but the balancing is very well done. furthermore like most good cooperative games it is easy to adjust the difficulty level.
Like in pandemic games have a set duration. this one has 42 cards and the length of the game is excellent.
If you are familiar with the universe and like cooperative games try to dind a copy at an affordable price. It's OOP now.

Yggdrasil is a co-operative game in which players are different gods of the Norse mythology: Odin, Thor, Tyr, Frey, Heimdall and Frejya. Monsters, the wolf Fenrir, the huge serpent Jormungand, the Fire Giant Surt, the Goddess of the Dead Hel, the traitor Loki and the cosmic dragon Nidhogg are moving forward in Asgard inescapably and announce the impending coming of chaos and destruction on the world tree Yggdrasil. Together the players have to resist to the impending coming of the Evil forces in Asgard, the gods' world.

RATING: N/A
Loses some replayability over time, but it's fun to introduce it to new players and see what strategies they can come up with. People tend to have surprisingly different ideas about what the best strategies and playing styles are.

Ultimately, this game feels like it's lacking somewhere. I think it's a combination of the poor difficulty scaling, the somewhat imbalanced characters, and some other intangible lack of satisfaction.

Worse of coop games ever played.  throw-the-dice-and-move type of mechanism hindered under a pale viking mythology theme.    Two points for the graphics the rest is just zero or négative.  

My two cents:  Games made by french authors are for some reason very strong on hype when they come out. Never buy such a game by a "coup-de-coeur" when they come out because 80% of the time is just a "coup-de-merde"...

Played this wrong the first 2 times and which made a very hard game even harder.  I didn't think I'd like it in part because you don't control a piece that moves across the board, but that didn't matter.  I like the theme, the choices of what to do each turn, the different gods' powers, drawing from the bags, and how the villains slide across.  Tense all the way through.  Really neat and easy to pick up once you get started. 
Was able to win largely by thinning and reseeding the white bag.
Solid game, I think I still prefer Ghost Stories, so I can't see adding this to my collection, but would absolutely play again.

One of the best coop games out there ! The game and theme blends together very well, making it a great experience every time. Pretty accessible even with the heavy difficulty level.
A little explanation about my more negative scores : 
- When taking your actions in many cases you have no choice, as it is obvious what has to be done.
- Some roles are way better than others (also depending on amount of players).
- The creatures being very different is great, but with some unlucky consecutive Fenrir draws and bad rolls mostly means the end of the game and there is nothing you can do about it.

I really wanted to like this game more since I love Norse mythology, but despite being a very hard co-op this game lacked tension. Unlike something like Ghost Stories where suddenly a huge wave of ghosts suddenly chain one after another and half the game you're desperately trying to just stay ahead of tempo, the slow plodding along of the monsters made it feel like I was more in a pushing match rather than feeling like my back is to the edge of a cliff. It didn't help that for some reason the gods' abilities just didn't feel that different from each other, and while some of the monsters have really powerful effects, they somehow still felt abstracted. That's not to say it is a bad game. There's definitely a lot of forward planning you need to do, and deciding whether you should play the long game of boosting your equipment, pulling fire giants out of the bag, etc. or if you need to deal with this threat right now. It's just didn't capture me the way I hoped it would.

RATING: 7
[2011-08-16] A little long but does its theme proper justice. It was fun figuring out strategies. The end game is a let down since you can tell that you can no longer lose before the final turn. Not sure how to best use the advanced cards but we are ready to take this to the next level. Definitely harder with more players - we play with 2 characters each if we play 2 player games. We had a great 3 player game which we lost by just being unlucky at rolling against the damn dog, killing turn after turn.

[2013-03-01] Have a killer player aid for this. Can't see uploading it since we can't get the expansion. It sold out after 2 days in the BGG store - that totally sucks. Darn.

Ken:
Very pretty game with good theme and some elegant mechanics.  Did not play well with 2 - limited number of players required a focus on combating the major enemies and ignoring the other elements of the game.  Further, game lacked in the tension present in many other co-ops, likely due to the lack of visual "chaos" on the board.  Higher player counts recommended.

Would play again with 3+ players.  No chance of future re-acquisition.

It looks (and feels) gorgeous and I am totally partial to the theme.

That it still doesn't score higher than 5, is because it really is just a solo game, with the density being diluted with every extra player. Players can just come and go as they wish, as long as just one player stays put to direct the action. 
Many coop games suffer i part from this, but this one is the most blatant I have tried - more players only means more downtime, so keep it a solo.

Maybe its a good wife-friendly 2-player game - if she likes the theme.

Only problem I have with this game is that *every single battle* we did was exactly the same: pay viking warriors enough to win the battle with a score of 1 on the die. It seems too risky to need a score of 2 (let alone 3) to win, and a waste to pay vikings enough to win without even rolling the die...

Yggdrasil is one of the most beautiful-looking games I've ever owned or seen, but it lacks depth. It plays like a mix of Pandemix and Defenders of the Realm but isn't as interesting as either of them. All of the loss conditions are in one basket: the Asgard track. That means only one big thing to keep track of, instead of several as in the other two games.

I enjoyed it enough to try it twice, but twice was enough to have a solid strategy we didn't see much need to change. Upping the difficulty might have helped with that, but it wouldn't have changed the underlying simplicity -- which is too bad, because I wanted to love this game. All that variety on the surface just didn't add up to much variety in play. Sold.

It's a nice game, but not as tense as Ghost Stories I believe. I think it's even harder than Ghost Stories as it is possible to scale the difficulty as you want. With 6 people, I think last difficulty would be impossible to beat. Tried it alone and with two people, and way easier, but the strategy make it so that it seems like you only have certain choices to make in order to win, not many paths to victory.

Played 20-25 times.

Update:
Burnt out on this but will happily play again twice a year or so. The game can become a little repetitive, but that´s where the variable powers, the variant enemy cards and the individual powers of the ice giants come into play. With 1 or 2 players I would recommend that you either add the tougher enemy cards or play with the weaker gods, just to keep the game challenging.
- - -

I rate it an 8 after three games solo, one 4-player with adults and one 2-player with our 7-yo. Very clean and simple rules. Interesting decisions every turn. The difficulty level is easy to adjust, not only with the extra cards but with what gods you play, the number of players and so on. This is a good thing and a bad thing, as it´s hard to compare sessions and decide when you should make the game more challenging.

Admittedly, I have A Thing for co-operative games, but Yggdrasil is just so well put-together. The major theme of co-op games - that is, actually talking to one another, working things out between you and co-ordinating your moves - is absolutely, 100% required with this one, especially when you start adding in Angry Gods and Ragnarok cards. The board is beautiful, the theme is engaging, and while the runic symbols and billion little tokens may seem daunting at first, it flows into something simple, challenging, and satisfying.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Very fun co-op. this game WREAKS of theme (not a bad thing). 

The only other game I've ever played that was this thematic was Shadows Over Camelot. 

I love the playstyle, but i feel it ultimately suffers from a few balance issues. I know some disagree with me, but I believe the issues are more severe than they should to be to give this game a high replay value. 

I had to reflect this in my overall score unfortunately due to this over site. 

Aside from that, the theme really saves this one for me.

(One solo play) Thought it might be easy, but the game definitely creamed me.  Beautiful artwork, love the norse-mythology theme, nice blend of a ton of different mechanics (bag-management, luck-mitigation, passing now for greater rewards later). 

Honestly didn't really grab me though, mostly because of the win-loss conditions. The goal of the game is just to survive until the deck runs out.  And the way you lose is by the markers for the bad guys getting too far to the right on a track (on which they move every turn).  So in essence, you need to spend as many actions and resources as possible stopping them from moving.  The rest of the game boils down to be distractions and resource-collecting.  To me, this was not very thematic or engaging.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Az artwork nagyon hangulatos, kiváló miliőt teremt a viking mondakörnek. Odin csarnoka felé csörtető hat szörnyet kell megakadályoznunk abban, hogy vagy valamelyikük bejusson oda (7. mező) vagy hárman közülük eljussanak a Valhalláig (5. mező), vagy öten a 3. mezőre (Asgard falai) kerüljenek. Magyarul ők jönnek szépen előre minden körben, nekünk meg vissza kell rugdosnunk őket (=harc), hogy a fenti vereséghez megadott paraméterek ne teljesüljenek. Jobb esetben mindig csak egyikük lép egy mezőt, de Breki barátunk - akit a viking mitológiában egyébként Nidhöggnek hívnak - képes egy cimbijét is maga után hívni.

A játékmenet egyébként végig izgalmas, nem nagyon lohad a presszúra, szóval unalmas percekre ne nagyon készüljön senki. A döbbenet a játékban (és úgy látom, már más is írta), hogy simán elhisszük mekkora jók vagyunk, aztán hirtelen 1-2 kör és hupsz, kikaptunk mégis.

Ja, igen, győzelem akkor van, ha elfogy a szörny pakli (vagy hivatalosan, az Ellenség kártyák). Alapból egyébként ez egy 42 lapos paklit jelent, azaz ennyi kört kell túlélnünk (elárulom előre: nem nagyon fog sikerülni), de mazochistáknak van még egy extra pakli is, amit bele lehet keverni (+10 lappal), hogy tutira ne legyen sikerélménye a csapatnak.

A játékosszámot még nem írtam: mivel koop játékról van szó, egyedül is lehet (teljesen frankó amúgy úgy is), de max. 6 játékos ülhet a tábla köré viking isteneket imitálni. Ez is egy jó nagy piros pont, hogy nem a klasszikus 2-4 játékosra, hanem 1-6-ra lett tervezve és ahogy eddig tapasztaltam, egészen jól működik minden játékosszámnál. "Jól áll neki", hogy kooperatív egyébként. Nehéz megmagyarázni ezt a mondatot, de ha kompetitív lenne, simán dobnám a kukába (jó, nem, de legalább 1-2 ponttal kevesebbet adnék rá).

Találunk néhány egyedi mechanizmust a játékban a választható akciók között, de nem nagyon akarom ezeket most spoilerezni, mert egyrészt többen már úgyis leírták, másrészt meg jobb ezeket felfedezni mindenkinek magának.

A játék szabályzata kicsit zagyva lehet elsőre, de játék közben minden letisztul (ami meg nem, az a második játék közben). Elég egyszerű egyébként: húzunk egy szörny (=ellenfél) kártyát, lépünk vele, elvégezzük a spec. akcióját, aztán mi jövünk és három akciót hajtunk végre (különbözőket). Ennyi egy kör. Pörög. Annyi tekerés van benne, hogy minden istenség, amiket a játékosok alakítanak rendelkezik valamilyen extra tulajdonsággal (pl. 3 helyett 4 akciót hajthat végre, +1 harci pontot kap, vagy mondjuk két egyforma akciót is csinálhat körönként).

A túlzott(nak látszó) egyszerűsége von csak le az értékéből, valahogy mindig adja magát, hogy mi lenne a helyes lépés. Ennek ellenére viszont többször van bukó, mint győzelem, szóval elég ambivalens érzés ez.

Nem volt könnyű beszerezni, értem én a hype-ot körülötte (OOP is, szép is, egész jó koop is), viszont nagyobb komplexitást vártam tőle. Biztosan nem jön be mindenkinek, főleg a borsos másodlagos piaci ára miatt sem kedvező az ár/érték aránya, de aki szereti gyűjteni az ikonikus játékokat és nem jelent gondot 30-40k-t kiadni egy olyan játékért, ami nem biztos, hogy bejön, akkor javaslom megvételre. Személy szerint nem bántam meg a beszerzését, mert nagyon jó játékról beszélünk, csak a hírneve miatt valószínűleg túl magasak voltak az elvárásaim vele szemben, amiknek csak részben felelt meg.

A poor solo experience, but a fun game with 5+ (haven't tried it with 2-4 yet). Requires communication and teamwork, or so I assume (I'm 0-6 at the game).

I now have a couple of wins in the 2-player game with my wife. Having the weapons divided between 2 players rather than 5 or 6 makes a big difference.

This game is a real bitch to win with 5+. I'm now 0-9 with that count. I like that.

I love Yggdrasil. It has worker placement mechanics without having to actually place a worker. Let's call it action placement I guess. Bag-building is a super cool mechanism that let's you mitigate the randomness of picking resources blindly.

Yggdrasil is a cooperative game where you fight back the evil forces of Ragnarök. You can improve your odds by upgrading your character and modify the mix in draw bags but in the end, it all boils down to die rolls. The decisions are not very engaging, the pretty illustrations can't conceal the weak theme and the lack of progress (both you and your enemies get better but the gameplay is the same) soon makes the game repetitive.

My rating is only based on solo play, and I really think it's probably a bit low. Such a beautiful board, and they've done a fantastic job of creating a thematic experience with the iconography, art and actions. I *was* a bit confused by the iconography at first, but 10 minutes or so into the first game, everything made perfect sense.  Solo with one, I find the game to be engaging, but perhaps a bit long for what it is. With 9 choices to select from across 42 turns, the game became a bit repetitive for me. The choices do get more desperate as the game goes along, which I like, and there are definitely some "press your luck moments" when you can't do what you'd like, and just hope that a particular card doesn't show up. I am curious to see how it goes with more players, but I honestly don't think it is a particularly deep co-op.  Absolutely beautiful, very mechanically straight forward, but perhaps a bit samey across plays.  Need more plays, though.

Good thematic, and enjoyable game but the game seems unbalanced with regards to the number of players (overly easy with 2-3 players and very hard with 5-6 players). The game also lacks in building an end-game climax: if you've counted and planned the sequencing of upcoming cards, you might know you've won the game 10 cards in advance. Once you've figured out that the most crucial task is to "clean" the bags, the game will become much easier.

Nice! This is incredibly simple to play but difficult to win. After a few plays now and only 2 wins, we feel ready to make it more challenging. But good news, all you need to do to up the challenge is add in some angry enemy cards or a ragnarok card or two.

The artwork and quality of compnents is outstanding. Beautiful design and super simple game play also makes this game very accessible to new or casual gamers. For example, one turn consists of drawing an enemy card and performing 3 actions. The cooperative aspect of the game also works very well and new players will enjoy making their own decisions even though it is their first time playing.

A great game we enjoy playing often, the rules are easy to remember and relearn too after a hiatus of game play. Great game!

RATING: 6
An unthematic venture into push-you-backs. You win by surviving the deck. The deck pushes gods forward on the track, so each turn (mostly) you roll to push one back. There's a bunch of supporting actions (you get 3 a turn) to assist you in your rolling, including elves (one-off +1 after die roll), weapons (permanently add between 1 and 3), vikings (one-off +1 you commit prior to die roll) and various ways to stock bags with, and collect vikings from, various bags which represent islands. But they're all supporting cast to the main action ... roll a die to knock back a god. Meaning every turn is much like the other, until you're done. Hope you roll well. Or collect and spend enough oomph to guarantee it. While it can be argued that Ghost Stories is much the same, this feels one dimensional compared to GS. There's no spatial attributes, of placing the ghosts and then having to travel the board, and consequently there is no location tradeoff (limiting yourself to the available actions and limiting which ghosts you can hit) which requires co-ordination of who's going to do what. As such Yggdrasil felt repetitive with little co-op - each player decides which god he'll specialise in and there's the option to trade stuff if necessary (which costs an extra action) and that's about it. I'd play it further to determine play optimality, and that might provide satisfaction, but I suspect with no particular joy attached to it.

First, I want to say that this is one of the nicest looking games I've seen.  Love the art work.

This is a co-op game where everyone is working together to keep the evil Norse 'Gods' in check.  I like this game, that said I don't think it has the level of choices as Pandemic or the replay value.

Fun, Colorful, Chaotic, Norse-Themed, Seige-Type Coop !! Perfect Theme and Mechanisms Integration !! Tense down to the wire !! The Gods MUST work together, or be beaten mercilessly. If players get good, they can turn the screw even more with the advanced cards.

This is one of the first Co-op games that hit me and my wife just right. Easy to teach. Very slight learning curve. IMO, not a gateway game.

My alternate name for this game might be Probability Management, since players are adjusting draw bags and rolling the special die; these mechanisms over time can turn off some gamers.

I've heard this compared to Ghost Stories a lot. I don't know that I entirely agree with that comparison.

Ghost Stories throws enemies at you from, literally, all directions and it feels like you're up against it right away. Yggdrasil feels sneakier since the Ice Giants can distract you from focusing on the enemies' linear progress. You may feel you're doing OK against the enemies and have plenty of time to deal with them after dispatching the Ice Giants but that may not be the case...

I found this game very tedious and boring.  There is basically a "right" strategy (white bag) and once you find it the entire gameplay is pretty much totally scripted.  

Even if you aren't playing with a winning strategy it is basically about card-counting (well, token-counting) and probabilities, and since it's a co-op it boils down to the guy who is good at card-counting tell you what to do this turn.

Awesome coop game. This game is really fast paced and easy to understand. The amount of options is not too crazy, and a team that coordinates well will be able to do good in this game. The norse gods theme fits well, and the artwork is great (Piero). The only complaints I have are the "island" bags, which I think are Ok, but feel easy to mess up or drop around. I will have to think whether or not a better system could be implemented. The other thing is that the hero "cards" are huge. I think a regular size card for the heroes would have been better. I like to sleeve my cards, and this means I will have to laminate these large things.

I absolutely love this game, both for its artwork and challenging gameplay. I have only played it twice, once with 4 players and another solo. We came very close to beating it but our strategy ended up not being as sound as we thought! When I played it solo, I was able to beat the game but it was quite a struggle and mostly came from a bit of luck in being able to combine a super-helpful frost giant rune right when I was close to being slaughtered!

The only downside I see is that there doesn't seem to be much incentive to move the Vanir; at least our gaming group didn't think there was. Maybe we would have won if we had, hah!

RATING: 5
Solid coop game, but very prone to the leader syndrome - more than other games in the genre. In "Yggdrasil" you can calculate almost every move, it's a very mathy game more about probabilities than nordic gods.

Don't get me wrong, it's beautiful and the grapics are dripping with theme, but the gameplay... not so much. I enjoy it mostly as a solitaire puzzle. I'm also not sure about replayability - the turns seem very "samey" and apart from the sequence of cards nothing is randomized. Because of the smilarity of turns, I think many people will call this game boring, and I can't blame them!

Still, if you want to try yourself againt the unfavorable odds of the highest difficulty settings, you can enjoy it, but, as I said - rather as a puzzle!

UPDATE: Sold it, it was too dry and mechanic even for my liking :(

I enjoyed playing Yggdrasil.  There are a ton of game mechanics in play that, surprisingly, worked really well together.  This is the most sophisticated game I owned, and one of the most sophisticated I've played.  Lefebvre and Rabellino did well to take the time they needed to really make this game tight.

I also appreciated the ability to vary the difficulty of the game.  It's a bit tough trying to gauge how hard to make a given session though.  Further, as many others have said, the endings tend to be anticlimactic as you sense that you've beaten back enough of the enemy that a win is all but assured.  This, I believe, is the biggest failing in what's otherwise an excellent game.

I found that explaining the rules was a bit tough.  When I explain to new players that they can choose 3 (or 4, if they choose Frey) out of 9 possible actions, I almost invariably see that I'm about to lose them and have to cajole them into sticking with it.

Production values, for the most part, are extremely high.  The board design is so beautiful that I want to frame it and hang it on my wall.  The player mats are exceptionally done as well - not only the design but the material is lovely. That said, I'm a bit disappointed with the quality of the bags.

I'm quite pleased that I have a copy of this game.  Everyone I've played it with enjoys it as well.  I'm looking forward to having it on the table again.

#83 on my Top 100 Games of All Time (2015)

This is a cooperative game where each player takes on the role of a god with a special ability. And you have to keep attacking the different monsters in order to keep them at manageable levels. You win if you make it all the way through the monster deck without them overtaking you. There is a monster track on the board where they advance, and it has 3 different line breaks on it. They overtake you if 5 get past the first line, if 3 get past the second line, or if 1 gets past the third line. The artwork on the board is gorgeous.

A Ghost Storieshez hasonlítják nem véletlenül. Nekem játék közben teljesen ugyanazt az élményt adta. Érdekes, mert jobb abban, hogy akár 6-an is játszható és minden játékosszámnál szerintem jól működik. Jó abban is, hogy behatárolható a játékideje. Fix vége van nyerés esetén, esetleg hamarabb van vége. Ugyanolyan nehéz is, mint a GS. Sok lehetőség van, minden parti más lehet. Mégis egy ponttal most kisebbet adok neki, talán mert kevésbé éreztem izgalmasnak az elejét, illetve a GS pörgősebb, mert csak egy lépése és egy akciója van mindenkinek. De tetszett, jó játék.

A cooperative game that, in my opinion, doesn't do anything as well as its competitors.  It is a fine and challenging coop experience but there are so many better options out there.  It really is just a game of collecting different bonuses for me, which isn't very fun.  It has none of the tension and excitement that comes from a good challenging coop game.

For example, the dice rolling is way too prevalent with too few ways to play with the results.  I am not one of those gamers who has a fear or hatred of random games with lots of dice rolls.  I like a good helping of chaos in my games and love rolling dice.  The problem is that every enemy is fought the same way; they have a "defense" value equal to their position on the board, you add some number of "pre-roll" +1's, roll to get 0-3 attack with 0 being the most prevalent, add some number of rarer and more limited "post-roll" +1's.  Rinse and repeat...a LOT considering if you're not pushing an enemy back most turns you're probably going to lose because they move forward every turn.

Games like Elder Sign handle dice rolls a lot better.  There are still dice being rolled to randomly match symbols you need to banish monsters but aside from a character ability there are a breadth of items with various effects from increasing your chances of rolling a symbol, changing the symbol, getting an extra die, re-rolling, lessening the impact of a failure, changing the needed symbols for success, increasing your chance of success, etc.  Not just, add, roll, add again with your one chance of success.

The amount of options you have outside of fighting the enemies (which as I said needs to be done almost every turn) feels very limited as well.  Probably because they are just variations of collecting these bonuses you need to fight the enemies with greater success.  Which in turn makes the theme feel lackluster.  I love Norse mythology but all I'm really doing is collecting +1's to push tiles back.  Yawn.

Yggdrasil.  Ok, first off, this game is probably a 6.5 or maybe even a 7, I am taking a half point off because I can't pronounce the title.   So, why is it a 6.5?  It feels like a formula.  As the person was explaining the game, I wasn't thinking gods and frost giants, I was thinking odds and math.  OK, so the more I think about it, the more I think the 6 is deserved.

Yggdrasil is a solid co-op game, which looks good and plays smoothly. It fills more or less the same niche as Ghost Stories, but for me at least, not quite as successfully. If you already have Ghost Stories and are looking for something similar to provide variety, this would be a good choice.

Needless to say, it would also be good for those with a strong affinity for Norse mythology. It lacks the encyclopedic completeness of Hammer of Thor, but is far more playable.

I'm not a big fan of coop, but this one is pretty good.
I'm really attracted by the theme (helped by the gorgeous artwork).
On the down side, there's a lot of options for players each turn but two are basically useless.  And to make matter worse, once you've found a loop you keep repeating it until the end of the game (win or lose).  It's not the most compelling gameplay especially if you don't gamble with the dice (like you shouldn't).

This game went over real well with my gaming group.  This is my second co-op game and I find it much better than the first, which was Dungeons & Dragons: Ravenloft.  The game play is very quick & tense!  There are a number of Gods, which each player can play but I wonder if the difference in their powers are enough to keep up the replay-ability.  Replay-ability is my only question about this game.

When I am not playing this game I  am thinking about trading it.  I just feel like the games feel the same...pick up weapons, elves, and manipulate the bags for vikings.  Over and over again.

The last 3 times I have played Yggdrasil it was with the intention of confirming a decision to play it one last time before  trading it.  Each time I play it I feel like I want to keep it.  It's weird.  What is it that I like?  It looks great, I enjoying knocking bad guys back, it's easy to teach and pretty quick to play, and it can be made more difficult with the Ragnarok cards.  

I usually play this solo but my son joined me last night and after a few turns he said that he liked the game and that I shouldn't trade it.  So it stays!

Well not for that long it appears.  The next time we played my son and I felt like we were just doing the same thing each turn (manipulating the bags).  I put it up in a math trade and was able to get Labyrinth: War on Terror in exchange.

Addictive and tense gameplay, beautiful art. Very flexible difficulty scaling; the base game is pretty easy, but its very simple to add in cards to ramp up the challenge to whatever difficulty you want. (I'm guessing if you put in all the extra cards it would be pretty much impossible!) Lots of lively interaction with groups of players.

I'm not a huge fan of co-ops, but this game is awesome.  For starters, the graphics are beautiful.  Whoever illustrated this deserves an award.  Second, I love the mechanisms in the game, especially the bags.  That just adds so much fun.

I'm a tad concerned about the length, but I think it will speed up with multiple plays.  

I'm a big fan after one play, rating it a 7.  I think this will climb but only more plays will tell.

RATING: 8
Highly thematic co-operative game set in the world of Norse mythology. Players represent different Norse gods (each with their own unique power) who are attempting to prevent six monsters from progressing along a track, the end of which results in the destruction of the world tree Yggdrasil and the game being lost. Each turn a god can carry out three different actions, such as acquiring weapons, the souls of Vikings, help from the Elves etc, which will aid them in combat against the monsters who become increasing stronger the further along the track they move. The gameplay is tense as the monsters move ever closer to their destination and it feels as though you never have quite as many actions as you would like in order to be victorious. This is a game where clearly the theme was thought of first and then a game fitted into it and it has been very successful in achieving this aim.

Got this in a math trade Essen 2016 and finally got around to it. Pleasantly surprised by the elegant interlocking systems. So far, rating is temptative as I only played it solo twice (once Thor, once Odin).

The likes: lots of options, always strained for actions, some tension in combat, the possibility to plan everything in advance.
The dislikes: the distribution of the deck really matters for the difficulty. As a solo-game, this game is not that difficult:
- ignore Niddhog and Jormungand, focus on Loki and Fenrir and to a lesser extent Surt
- go to the forge every turn, start fighting as soon as you have a +3 weapon and devote at least one action to fighting the rest of your turns
- focus on the white bag, first by weeding out the giants and subsequently stacking it from the World of the Dead
- only use the first step of the Sacred Land, using it to set up a Valkyrie combo as soon as the white bag is sufficiently prepared and the submerged island isn't white anymore
- kill any giant that hampers you as soon as you have opportunity (after Ashgard, always after Ashgard)
- with Odin: except for the very first Niddhogg stack all of them to the very end of the deck
- try to fit as many vikings to a dice roll that you need 1 hammer. That gives you 50% to make a roll, potentially using an elf to make sure it succeeds and thus costing you half an action to make (on average). If you have more vikings, you might go easier on the vikings, but I find they are in short supply sometimes (when the wrong island is submerged).

Played my first game (Thor) without any special cards, easily winning it (Niddhogg and Jormungand on power level 3, all else on 1). Stacked the full compliment of special cards (no Ragnaroks, only the double moves) in for a game with Odin, barely winning that one so that seems to be the 50/50 spot, having the game hang on dice rolls only (when playing right).

That all being said, this is solo which is MUCH easier as f.e. a two-player game. As you have all the weapons, all the choice, all the abilities to do exactly what is needed RIGHT NOW instead of waiting a nailbiting turn if you are not taking too much risk. The more players, the harder it will get. Won't even think how difficult this game must be with 4 players and the full set of Ragnarok cards in...

If you like Norse mythology, don't mind getting your ass potentially handed over on a plate and are looking for a decent coop look no further, you just have found your game.

It is one of those games where there at a LOT of little things to remember due to all the special powers but it is easy enough to get in the flow once you have the game underway.

Cracking game. Oozing in theme designed by someone who really knows their mythos. Interesting and varied play always wanting to be able to do more but fairly clear cut in where the priorities are. This cuts down on AP and lets the game move inexorably to it's conclusion. Base game is fairly do-able but extra cards in the base game allow you to ramp it up by degrees - to the near Ragnarok impossible! Nice touch rather than as promos or expansion.
Highly recommended. Scales well too with less players making it easy - so just throw in the Ragnarok challenges!

A classic cooperative game, with simple working mechanisms and a strange theme.

It's an easy game to play (though not so to set-up!) that creates a sense of urgency like few other games. The special abilities of the multiple enemies is a particularly nice touch, and the headaches they cause are game changing. Thus the game offers some hard tactical choices in several rounds. It also has several difficulty levels, and the top levels are really hard - which is great.

On the downside, the theme is weird for those who don't particularly care about the viking mythology, and the interaction is not so great as in other cooperatives. The game does change significantly depending on the number of players, but at the same time there are optimal strategies for every player number.

All in all it is an enjoyable and unique, though not great, experience.

[thing=71671][/thing] is a somewhat light co-operative game in which the player embody Gods from the Norse mythology: Odin, Thor (not exactly like in the movie), Tyr, Frey, Frejya and Heimdall. They are fighting the menace of many monsters in the end of days, the Ragnarok. These enemies are: Surt, the Fire Giant; Jormungand, the Serpent; Fenrir, the dire wolf; Hel, the Godess of the Dead; Nidhogg, the cosmic dragon; and Loki, with his Frost Giants. All of them come towards Asgard to destroy it, and also bring down Yggdrasil, the world tree.

The game is pretty simple to understand: in the start of the turn, the players turns a card from the Enemy deck, and moves foward the corresponding enemy, and then applies the effect of it (Hel, for example, takes out vikings from the bags; Surtur puts Fire Giants in Midgard (the bags); Loki brings Frost Giants; and so on).

After this, the player has three actions to choose from nine possible, but can't make the same action twice (except Freyja, since this is her special power). The nine possible actions are: ask for the Elves' help; get a Weapon from the Dwarves; send the Valkyries looking for Vikings' souls on the mankind world Midgard; fight the Giants and try to gather the parts of a magic rune; negotiate with the Vanir; get rid of the Fire Giants who invade Midgard; get the Vikings back from Hel's world; exchange forces with another god; and fight against the Enemies in Asgard.

After the actions were made, the turn passes for the next player and the game goes like this until: five Enemies reach the middle point; or three Enemies reach the advance point; or one Enemy reaches the final position. These Enemies must be in these places [u]in the end of a players turn[/u], so, if an Enemy reaches the final position, the player of the turn can still try to send it back. If one of these conditions happen, the Gods lose. The Gods win of the Enemy deck is depleted and none of the conditions above were met.

[thing=71671][/thing] showed itself as a agile game, with interesting decisions in a short frame of time (around one hour). [thing=71671][/thing] fills, for me, the same spot as [thing=30549][/thing] and [thing=37046][/thing], not only in time, but also in difficulty and the possibility of adjustment for harder or easier games. The production values in [thing=71671][/thing] are good, but not awesome: the art is great, but the Gods sheets are flimsy and way bigger than they need to be. The dice should be notched, but it is only painted.

But even with some not-great components, the game itself is really gome, and more than make-up for it. I liked [thing=71671][/thing] quite a bit and expect many more plays of it in the future.

Solo only so far. Played the 'base' game and won first time which was quite a let down. Then mixed in 6 of the special cards which produced more of a challenge - took another 3 goes to beat it which made it more enjoyable. Not sure of the longevity of this one, it's ok for now and very pretty but I'm not convinced I'll be pulling it out very often.

Choices aren't interesting - the stuff that needs done is pretty samey and repetitive, mostly just a matter of who's doing it when.

God powers odd in some cases - e.g. Heimdall is almost entirely just a worse Thor.

I've played w/ others as well as solo, this is the first game I've actually enjoyed solo.  Though it is better w/ more players.  

Sold.

[7-14]Now I have it on my iPad and will play from time to time. It's rating has come down as it has not retained its luster with me.  When played on low difficulty it's easy to grok, when played more difficult, it is hard, but also hard to care when it starts to feel like luck determines outcome after winning and losing w/ same thought process.

RATING: 6
Feels like one of those good, old-fashioned co-ops that is simple and fast, kinda like [gameid=823] or [gameid=30549].  There's nothing particularly new or different feeling, but the charm of this game lies in its truly wonderful art and its unique theme.  There are some issues with the game being easily learnable and on rails, but you'll get enough plays in before you know it too well.  Worth checking out for co-op fans.

Yggdrasil is a co-operative game in which players are different Gods of the Norse mythology: Odin, Thor, Tyr, Frey, Heimdall and Frejya. Monsters, the wolf Fenrir, the huge serpent Jormungand, the Fire Giant Surt, the Goddess of the Dead Hel, the traitor Loki and the cosmic dragon Nidhogg are moving forward in Asgard inescapably and announce the impending coming of chaos and destruction on the world tree Yggdrasil. Together the players have to resist to the impending coming of the Evil forces in Asgard, the Gods' world.

Each player, depending on the God he plays, has a specific power that allows him to perform some actions better. All of these actions have to be used in the right moment or the victory will be unreachable. The players will need cleverness, calm and team spirit to challenge the game.

Just look at the board and the game gets a 7.  I could hang the board on my wall as art, then you play it.  

It took my group of friends 5 plays to beat this game it was such a harsh learning curve, but the feasts in Valhalla were worth the sacrifice!

I love being Odin and crafting our fate down the road.

Depending on how you set up the gods deck this game goes from a bit too easy to WAY too hard with little to no in between.

Having said that the simple game does offer a good bit of tension though I think I prefer other co-ops.

The theme is excellent though!

A very good cooperative game. The game is treated wonderfully, quite evocative and rich. It seems easy at first to win, but then things can go wrong quite fast.

It's quite simple, after a few turns, to understand all rules.

Board and player mats: graphics over function. Very cheap bags.

gameplay: repetitive. Throw vikings into bag, draw vikings from bag, fight. Next.

This is a _GREAT_ 'game to play with Garpill Games "Raiders of the North Sea":
you get to see what those darn Valkyrie are up to,
and what those pesky gods are doing with all those Vikings
(Insert mandatory Erik the Viking' reference here!)

Co-op Norse Gods protecting the World Tree Yggdrasil. Monsters, evil, and the traitor God Loki are converging on Asgard. Special dice combat with the aid of your vikings from Midgardr, supporting elves and magic items on loan from the Dwarven forge. Beautiful art and quality production. Rich and infectious theme.

I reallly like this game.

Its a great coop game with variable challenge (from 'thoughtful game' to 'every thing you do matters'), clever luck mitigation mechanics, a beautiful game board.

The game combines several random factors like cards, dice, and draw bags with several mitigating factors which allows for fantastic replay value while maintaining order.

The game causes you to make important and meaningful decisions virtually every turn in order to succeed at higher difficulties.  I've never played a game where so many decisions I made kept me in the game for another turn instead of being defeated.

This is probably the best coop game I've ever played, and its near the top of my board game list overall.

Update: Wow was I ever playing this wrong. Read through the rules again and then played another game solo. Got my ass handed to me on a platter. I see myself playing this many more times. Will benefit from some expansions. Upgrading my rating fromm 6.99 to 8.5.

I seriously kicked this games ass solo, hence the low rating. Needs more plays and a rules review, maybe I played it wrong to my advantage. Feels repetitious after a while. Kind of a bummer so far. Artwork is beautiful.

A very good co-op if you like those.  Has a theme that might appeal to players who don't dig Pandemic's "real world" feel.  The problem is that there's a definite "way to win" and the game becomes decidedly harder as you add more players.

Jaj, ez nagyon jó volt. Viszonylag egyszerű játékmenettel rendelkező, de nagyon izgalmas koop játék mitikus lények ellen. Különböző istenek bőrébe bújva vesszük fel a harcot ellenük, de vikingek, tündék(?) és valkűrök, valamint különböző fegyverek is segítenek minket az összecsapásban.

Main flaw: too few decisions. I like it as a co-op but it is a bit too light and too long for what it offers. In comparison with other co-ops (Pandemic, Defenders of the Realm, Flash Point...) this one plays in another (lower) league. Also there's no real endgame or boss-fight. You repeat the same steps over and over again and suddenly it's over.

Best looking board in my collection. This one certainly has a lot of soul. It captures the Norse mythology just perfect. 
 
I find it at it's best when played with all ragnarok cards. Your turn comes quickly and the game doesn't suffer as much from a leader that tells you what to do, since your options or individual aciotns aren't that huge or difficult to deceide on. The meat and challenge of the game is in coordinating your actions with the rest of the group. 

One of my favorite coops (other is ghost stories)

RATING: 5
This is a beautiful looking game (as are all games illustrated by Piero) that works well mechanically, has an interesting theme, isn't too long, and has a good challenge built in. However, the repetitive nature of the turns can be a problem, the main original idea in the game (manipulating the contents of bags to swing the odds in your favor) isn't as thrilling as the theme merits. The dice combat I enjoy, but the special powers of the characters aren't as cool as, say, the Pandemic characters. 

I don't know, I guess this game just feels a little undercooked and way too late to the party. Ghost Stories and Pandemic have this whole thing covered. This doesn't bring enough new interest to dethrone those two.

RATING: 7.6
Very impressed with this one. It's extremely entertaining solo, requires a relatively small amount of space, and increases challenge without bogging down flow when players are added.

Edit: 11/4/15
This is basically only in my collection for solo play, but that's totally acceptable when the solo play is so consistently rewarding. A keeper!

Gencon 2016 pickup. Needs several more plays before rating.

Update 1/9/2017- I have played this several times now, with several different groups of people. This is a solid press your luck game. It is on the lighter side of medium, but definitely a step up from something very basic, like Zombie dice. The components are nice and the theme engaging. I took a risk buying this one, but I'm calling it a win.

Update 11/6/2017. This game continues to hit the table for casual play and continues to be fun. Definitely a game that is better than the sum of it's parts. Press your luck +screw your neighbor makes for a fun evening. I have made this game my default gateway game with new gamers.

This game is a reimplementation of Ouro de Tolo, well, there are things that I enjoyed in this game more than the first and there are things that i didn't, but overall they all share the same enjoyment from me. The components are the most notable improve, I liked the set collection sell and the art is improved, too. But I prefer the race aspect of the first game more than the fixed 5 rounds.

I evaluated it a little bit better after another play, it does fix some lack of balance and luck between players.

Esse jogo é uma reimplementação de Ouro de Tolo, bem, existem coisas nesse jogo que gostei mais do que o outro, e coisas que prefiro no anterior, mas de um modo geral, eles compartilham o mesmo entretenimento para mim. Os componentes são as melhorias mais notáveis, eu gostei das vendas de coleção e a arte é melhorada também. Mas eu prefiro o aspecto de corrida do primeiro jogo mais do que as 5 rodadas fixas de Quartz.

Eu avaliei um pouco melhor o jogo depois de outra partida, ele arruma algum problema de balanço e sorte entre os jogadores.

As a push-your-luck game with a relatively small footprint, it makes a fun little pub game. Aside from that I've had some luck playing it with non-gamers. It's easy to pick up and has some nice artwork/components. I don't find myself aching to play it, but it has utility in my collection. What sets it apart from other push-your-luck games is the deck of cards, which allow you to do some quirky things like pawning off the things you don't want on other players.

This is a press your luck game (sort of) with a lot of "take that" card play. In a play group that does not pick on one person too much, and does not take a game like this too seriously, it's going to be a hit. The production value on the mine carts, cards, and gems is outstanding. Will definitely see play in our lighter gaming groups.

I believe it needs a couple house rules to make it truly a great game, but it is fun enough even as currently designed to be worth the $20-25 it sells for. Again, don't be a dick and don't take it too seriously, and this will be worthwhile.

Cute little push your luck game with beautiful components. The thematic connect between mining and drawing gems out of a bag is great. The take-that cards are really fun and don't feel mean at all. Probably because they have cute titles you have to read out loud when you're playing them, and also because it's a quick game anyway, so if you lose, just play another one. Very light strategy.

Simple take-that family game.  Push your luck where you lock in your scoring for each round.  With one demo play it seemed like the game would stall due to the small number of card action available over the course of the game.

RATING: 6
I've only played it once with four people. As others have said, it's very similar in style to Incan Gold, but includes screwage cards. Honestly it runs a little too long for my tastes. I like Incan Gold because it's over in about 15 minutes and you can play again quickly if you're too far behind. This four person play took almost 45 minutes, which seemed about 20 minutes too long when one player took a commanding lead very early in the game. Maybe a Sudden Death house rule would help things here.

Quartz is a light, fast game that works great as a filler or palette cleanser after an evening of heavier games. The components are top notch and the gameplay is satisfying. It won't be your favorite game of all time, but it fits a certain niche.

RATING: 7
A push your luck game best played with friends who can enjoy some good-natured 'take that'. The fun in Quartz relies heavily on taking valuables that belong to others and handing off liabilities to your neighbors. The addition of action cards distinguishes this game from other terrific push your luck titles like Diamant and Dicey Goblins. Art and component quality are both top-tier. Push your luck games, in my experience, are fun for a few plays and then must be shelved for a bit in order to stay fresh. Quartz is no different.

I really wanted to like this game, but it fell short of expectations. Too much luck and 'take that' involved, and eliminated players lost interest frequently. After a while, the game just dragged, and all I could think of was 'when is this going to end?'.

RATING: 9
A simple push-your-luck game that keeps everyone one their toes. Friendships are destroyed as every becomes familiar with the biggest vice Dwarves suffer - greed.

The artwork is beautiful. The rules are simple and clear. The gem pieces are gorgous!

The luck base aspect of this game adds the right amount of excitement while other mechanics such as action cards and heroic rewards allows for multiple playstyles.

The only downside to this game is that with five players the 5 rounds takes much longer than many can digest for a game that should pride itself on being quickly over. My group houserules that 5 players only has 4 days. It seems the sweet spot is 3 players which is quick, but long enough to never really be truly behind.

About [thing=172881][/thing]:

[b]1) What is it?[/b]
[thing=172881][/thing] is a push your luck game reimplementing an older game named [thing=94822][/thing]. In the gsme players are dwarven miners, trying to find the best crystals. There is a good lot of "take that" in [thing=172881][/thing], due to the use of several cards that effect the other players - there are defensive cards also. Finally, the game offers a mechanic of set collection, specially in order to make the crystals with lower values (which are the ones that players usually find the most) allow for a boost in points in other ways.

[b]2) How do you play?[/b]
Every player starts with 5 random cards. Then the options are simple: in her turn the player either leave the mine, play a card or dig (draw from the sack) for crystals, keeping whatever she finds. The player is eliminated of the round if she accumulates two unstable crystals, losing all the crystals found thus far in that round, but at least gains on experience token, which, in later rounds, the player can use to discard one unstable crystal.

If the player leaves the mine by decision (not eliminated by unstable crystals), she tally her the money received by selling the crystals, maybe using some of the set collection options in order to boost the value received.

Every player receive one card at the end of the round. After 5 rounds, the player with the most money wins.

[b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b]
To dig or not to dig. And screw or not screw, because most of the cards (not all) act in a bad way against someone else. And when to leave the mine. Usually pretty simple decisions to be made. Due to the set collection in the game, players might want to risk to dig more than they would without it.

While [thing=172881][/thing] is a pretty light game, it has more to decide than [thing=37759][/thing], being more in line with [thing=41][/thing]

[b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b]
- Good production value - art is very nice, the crystals are great, the bag and cards are of good quality;
- The experience tokens are a fine addition to the game, as they allow for players that were eliminated in a former round, making them better suited to catch up - I will most definitely use this in my copy of [thing=94822][/thing];
- Unused cards being worth points at the end of the game;
- Giving players one card every round;
- The set collection I'm adding in the good side, because it makes worst crystals better. However, this mechanic also makes the scoring more nebulous, increasing the chances of mistakes. And since it can make players risk more, is good for one side (laughs and tension) but bad in the other (losing everything and maybe also losing interest in the game).

[b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b]
- It takes longer than a push your luck should - it should be a 20-40 minutes game, not 45 to 60;
- Lots of take that - and these can not only serve to slow down the leader, but is usual for anyone with good crystals to be targeted for a steal or to receive unstable crystals from others, so it can, and often is, used to kick someone already down;
- The choice of colors for the crystals is ridiculous: dark green and light green, dark pink and light pink? Seriously? Here, for the next print:
[imageid=2859286]

[b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b]
Like an awful miner, in a society of bastards and robbers - not your usual fare of dwarves.

[thing=172881][/thing] is a quick game to learn and there ins't much downtime, as the options for the players are very limited (most of the time: play a card or dig for crystals). The card effects are all that many, and are mostly easy to understand.

[thing=172881][/thing] can be a fine family game, due to high luck factor involved, adults and kids will play evenly. But the take that factor can produce some hurt feelings.

Overall, [thing=172881][/thing] has several improvements over its predecessor - [thing=94822][/thing], but the longer nature of it is a crass mistake. There isn't anymore the tension of the "racing" [thing=94822][/thing] and its set 5 rounds almost assure that the game lasts more than it should, and for a push your luck type of game, duration is a key aspect, and can be a killer blow to make it last too much (see all the hate around [thing=1927][/thing]). I, for one, will adapt some of the ideas in my [thing=94822][/thing] copy and worry not about getting [thing=172881][/thing]. Still, for those interested, isn't difficult to make the game take 4 instead of 5 rounds, and won't throw any balance off, as [thing=172881][/thing] already have little of it.

I'm curious. Gem themed games have had a big uptick since the success of Splendor but... the gems in this game don't have that lush feel, even if the cover art does. The gamepley would have to be REALLY something to make it as addictive as Splendor.

A game about producing goods, delivering them to towns, making your money from your sales and then using this money to show off how great a merchant you are. Sounds innocuous but make no mistake this is a very dirty, strategic game.

The game is of variable length (more on this later) with each round going through the same set of phases.  Depending on whether you have the original "die Handler" or the reprinted "Merchants of the Middle Ages", there is an additional phase (investment) but either way you could easily play with old or new rules with either edition.  The phases are: 1) purchasing goods.  You need goods to deliver in order to make money and the issues here are do you have the money to buy the goods you want, which town should you store them in, and are the goods you want already sold out? 2) wagon master/loading. There are three wagons that can be loaded and each is owned by the to be determined by blind bidding wagon master.  The wagon master gets to lead his goods for free and the type he loads also limits the types other players can load, but the tricky part is that you have to negotiate with him/her to load your goods 3) wagon movement. Each player has an equal set of movement tokens that they can use one of to move one wagon. You don't get your tokens back until you use them all and you generally only have limited control over how far and which direction a wagon moves. You will want it to go to certain cities as some cities will pay a bonus for your goods whereas others will not (this is open information). You will also want to make a stop by the courier (if you're lucky) who will reward you with powerful onetime use green cards (they have dovish abilities which are VERY useful) 4) market manipulation and goods selling. Each player has a secret wheel with dial (similar to el grande and maharaja) where you choose to move 0, 1, or 2 goods upwards (or sometimes downwards) in price. Once the prices are determined goods are sold and players keep their gold hidden in player sacks 5) upkeep and status. Players must pay a cost to maintain their status level and then they can pay to move up one or two levels in status. The name of the game is status with the player at the highest level winning. The difficult part is when to move how high to move and being able to stay at your level. There is a game clock that is determined by the players as after a certain number of wagons enter the city the game ends; also the more wagons that enter, the higher the status costs become. 

In the beginning of the game, players are given two unique character powers. These can also be auctioned off or using the new rules they are auctioned as a new such phase (investment). The abilities are varied and range from extra wagon movement, courier movement, market manipulation and more.

This is an extremely strategic and dirty game that plays 2-4, has great components, alot to think about, and plays competitively throughout the game.  A seriously overlooked and underrated title, which is very scarce to buy, but totally worth it if you can find a copy (assuming you like gamer's games, which this one definitely is).  Another top-notch title by the master Kramer.

I liked this, but found it in many ways more complex, Euro-ised, up-to-date version of Mine a Million.  There are a good deal of mechanics in common with that...imagine redoing that game as a Euro (action cards, markets etc and you're about there).  This one is certainly more cerebral, but I wouldn't say that it hugely more fun - a little bit certainly.  Nevertheless, I'd happily play it again, and I really do like the screwage aspect of the game...it can be very nasty.

I don't think it deserves it's rather big reputation, but it is a good game.

Very good wheeling-and-dealing game, from the Kramer-Ulrich team.  But make sure that you get the correct rules translation, for it is a delicate game that can be greatly undermined by a few wrong rules.  Also, don't try to "fix" some "problems" you initially feel; with more plays and better understanding of the subtleties of the game, the problems will go away and you'll see that this is indeed a well-designed, well-balanced game.

RATING: 6
{1 play, 4 players} Interesting.  On the one hand, it's a unique blend of economic engine/delivery/auction/negotiating systems... which is kinda cool.  But on the other hand, it's sort of a kitchen sink fish with feathers.  I think I'd rather play a straight up negotiating game, or just a delivery game, etc. instead of this mix... but after only one play, I can't really say for sure.  Especially since it's not like this game doesn't work - all the various systems fit together nicely, actually.  I'm just not sure I *want* a game like that.  Or at least not this version of it.  Maybe.  Further play is definitely needed.

RATING: 7
Pick up and deliver and lots of auctions. Great bitz - I love the way the goods are loaded into those toy-like wagons. Overall, I like it but don't feel a need to play it again right away. Better auction games out there and better pick up and deliver games too. Strangely, for what many call a negotiation game - the negotation aspect just didn't seem to be that big of a deal. Still, enjoyable.

RATING: 7
Merchants in medieval Europe.  The game involved negotiating your goods onto one of the wagons, hopefully when you are also in a tactical position to control where the wagon goes.  Alternately, you can win the blind bid to be the loadmaster and then extort your bid (and more) out of the other players.  I liked the mechanic where titles (i.e. victory points) start out cheap and become expensive.  Unfortunately, lots of blind bidding and blind market manipulation make for a somewhat lighter game than I would prefer.

Rating based upon one play.  Really plays best with four.  You need to be very aggressive on bidding to make sure that you're the loadmaster frequently.  Otherwise you can up getting pushed around too much.  Bids of 1500 are normal and can go from 1000-2000.

Die Handler remake.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I enjoy Die Handler as a 4-player game.  Keep in mind that I usually have a strong dislike for negotiation games!  However, Die Handler allows for clever, cut-throat negotiations that involve more than just money.  I prefer playing with the Open Negotiations Variant found in the rulebook.  This adds to the length, but it also adds to the richness of the game.  I prefer auctioning off the player powers as well.  

There are a few downsides to Die Handler.  First, you really need to have 4 players who not only understand the rules, but can also creatively exploit the rules for negotiation and profit.  Second, I find negotiating to be somewhat draining, so this will never be a weekly game for me.

After first read through of rules I thought to myself this is a game where there could be considerable screwage. After first play I think I was right but play could easily be softer for those who prefer some cooperation and less confrontation. Considerable scope for bluff, blockage, calculation and absolute brutality. The price of failure to maintain your status could easily take you from first to last. 

I'm gauging that the game really needs the full compliment of 4 to shine, would lose its teeth with 3 and be a fairly lame exercise with 2.

8 score after first play, I really enjoyed this and expect the rating to rise with further plays. An absolute gem.

Finally played it at last (twice)! I have had it for years hoping to get it on the table. Anyway, it lived up to the anticipation for me. Great game, packs a lot in to a reasonable playing time - we managed the first game in under two hours, including instruction. The second game was more cuthroat and lasted a bit longer, but the time flew. Loads of interaction, great rising tension, minimal down time, I found it easy to teach too, the game phases work well together. The rating may well go up if we play it enough to move on to auctioning the player powers.
The potential for negotiation is huge and there are plenty of ways to drop an opponent right in it - some quite imaginative and extremely cruel - so could possibly need the right sort of vicious and voluble group to really shine.

This didn't strike me as a terribly fun game on the first try, which is too bad, since I was very excited about playing.  Several reasons for this: 1. We played with only 3 and it seems to be a game that would be better with 4 (more negotiating would therefore be possible).2. Since it was the first time through the game, we didn't really do any cutthroat negotiating and instead just tried to get a feel for each phase of the game.  I think this may have led to us missing one of the major parts of the game.  3. The chaos factor in the game made it difficult to ever come up with any clear strategy.  It all felt very random, yet not in an exciting way.4. I think the expectations of this game may have been set way too high -- it has really cool bits and it's from the maker of El Grande.  This led us to believe it was going to be a much different type of game than it turned out to be (we expected heavy, we got light to med-light).5. I have trouble bringing this out to play when it seems to me that Traders of Genoa supersedes it entirely (although Traders is a much longer game to play).This one has a chance to go up on the next play (with 4 players)...otherwise, it looks like I can fetch some good money for it :)

Am very much torn with this game.  The game is solid, the gameplay flows pretty well, and the decisions can be quite complex.  However, I'm not a big fan of games where the leader can get mashed down by the other players colluding, because it penalizes smart decisions made by a player early in the game.  I guess that's also why I have reservations about El Grande.  In die Handler, it is quite possible to really screw a leader by refusing to let them load or by letting them win the bid, and refusing to load up yourself.  While that didn't happen in our game (it was a relatively cooperative game all things considered), I can see this becoming an issue, leading to an optimal strategy being one of sandbagging, which, imo, isn't very fun.  So, rated 6 for now...

This a great, underrated game. Lots of cool stuff going on, the bidding is cool, the economic system doesn't have the "exponential growth" problems, and there is a wealth of tactical details. Highly recommended. Chaotic, but fun. There may be an issue with the "Social Climber" event cards that give you a cheap bump on the status track, though: these seem awfully powerful. Have considered taking them (or some of them) out of the deck.

There is an ambiguity in the original German rules, and it's important to play correctly: the "wagon arrivals" track needs to advance once for *every* wagon that arrived that turn, not just once on turns on which any number of wagons arrive. The latter, incorrect interpretation (which early translations endorsed) leads to a game that is *far* too long.

RATING: 8
Definitely an improvement over Die Händler, the clarity on the endgame conditions and the new auctions for special powers are much better. Some of the sharp negotiation dynamics means that this won't be for everyone, but the underlying economic dynamics and management of risk are very clever are very interesting. It's not a top-tier game for me, but the clever mixture of auctions, risk management, and tactics for me makes a satisfying game.

I loves me the pick up and deliver system, and this one didn't disappoint too much.  The auctions for control of the trucks was a neat element that worked well with the rest of the game.  However, the main market mechanism is pretty stupid, with players secretly choosing price adjustments.  I wish it were more based on supply/demand.

I wanted this game for so long.  Any fan of Princes of Florence finds out that the two designers collaborated on this and want it immediately.  So, I played this game once.  I won.  It was the most unsatisfying win in history.  Why?  The central mechanics are golden.  Good auction, interesting movement and sale mechanics, and a variable stock market.  Now you have a good game.  But wait, Kramer's not finished just making a good game.  Nope.  His games have to be bigger than their britches, and with every layer he adds, the mechanics get rotten.  The special abilities are balanced, but are unnecessary and overpowerful in their respective domains.  The courier mechanic, the stock market mechanic, these work, until you give someone the power to change them drastically.  Now the game is ruined.  The stock pricing device idea is good, until a person can basically negate the motives of the table by changing the stock market how they want anyway.  Why even waste the time?  Why not bid to determine who can change the prices of goods if you are just going to destroy this mechanic?  The special card deck has some strong cards, but only 2 people will get these consistently.  One of these, the Broken Axle card serves no purpose but to target the player in the lead.  It destroys strategies and breaks the game.  It also makes the game mind-numbingly long.  Sure, you could play without these abilities, but why don't I just pick a game that doesn't have these problems instead.  Here's a tip for game designers.  If your core mechanics are good enough, build around them. Know what your game mechanics mean for your style of game, then make sure the game plays in a reasonable time, and realizes it's boundaries and limitations.  Kramer had a great stock market game, and then decided to make it bigger than it should have been.  Bad idea.  Some games are Caylus, and some games aren't, but not every game has to try to be to make it a good game.

Based on one play and I had that feeling where I had no idea how to strategize during the first turn or two and then the game started to reveal itself.  I've had very positive ratings to games where I've had a similiar reaction so this one looks like it could move up.  The fluctuations in how the different mechanics interplay is refreshing for being an older game.

Negotiation Variant: 
Very interesting take on the negotiation genre by Kramer, and a game that hasn't gotten enough recognition to date, likely due to its German only status. Many tricky decisions to be made during each step of the game: what roles to run with at the beginning of the game, how to handle the loading of the carts (win outright and sell or try to finagle a good deal from someone else), whether to pursue the courier cards, usw, usw. Many interlocking mechanisms that take a bit of getting used to, but once you're there it's a very a enjoyable time, with haggling a plenty and much nastiness afoot (i.e.: players colluding to run wagons into a town that screws you, broken axle cards, players winning wagons just to shut you out of some earnings, etc, etc). 

The fact that I am this enthusiastic about a game which features both blind bidding and the generally chaotic simultaneous choice mechanism (via the spinners to augment the value of goods) is very telling. The blind bidding works because an open auction, IMO, would wreck the tension that sometimes leads to a given player blowing over 1000 on the reins when they only needed to pitch out 400 for the privilege...it just adds that fun "I hope I'm guessing right about how much the other players are willing to pay" tension to the game. The simultaneous goods movement too seemed very understandable from my perspective...it was fairly obvious what everyone would want to increase (or roll over the top) so working with that in mind was generally pretty effective. I don't think those kinds of selections are very hard to contend with, so again, another mechanic that normally causes issues for me just wasn't one in this title.

I initially rated this the equal of Traders of Genoa. I don't think the game is quite at that level for me anymore though, so I have dropped the rating for it. While this game comes together nicely and has an interesting blend of mechanics, it has some strikes against it, namely that it requires exactly 4 and just isn't quite there at that level where I actively am pushing for it when we have that many people. The game system has latitude for clever moves, but it feels a bit like it's on a rail at times, and I would personally prefer Genoa at the 4 or 5 scales, as it has more hidden information and interesting decisions. Not a bad game by any means though, and the presentation is very nice. If you're seriously interested in Kramer or negotiation games it is a solid second box to have on your shelf. Just make sure that you play it enough to start auctioning off the special powers at the start of the game, as it makes the game more interesting because of the ability to pursue variant strategies.

Finally got around to playing this game. You are a trader of goods. Players will have slightly varying abilities which you have to carefully use to your advantage. Proper bidding and negotiations are also essential. You must also properly plan which goods you should be trading in and which wagons to use. Overall a good game which requires you to watch a lot of different elements. Decided to trade this after another playing. Traded for Mystery of the Abbey.

Alright--now THIS is my game!  I don't know what it is but DH is so evil and mean and competitive I just love it!  You have to know how to wheel and deal and come out ahead in the end.  the system for buying social status is very clever and ensures that you can catch up if you time a critical move to cause a cash shortage.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Die Händler is one of the nastiest games out there despite the cute looks. If you like auction games you'll love this one and if you like negotiation games, even better. If you like to screw people over as well this is your game no question about it.

You need four players for the game to really shine but shine it does. You take the roles of merchants trying to buy goods cheap and sell them for profit, nothing new there. What's new is that the market changes all the time so you have to buy the goods while they are in stock and while you can get them cheaply. After buying the goods and placing them in your warehouse in one of the cities on the board you have to get them to another city to sell them. This is where the wagons come in. There are three wagons in the game that go around from city to city on a route decided by the players. When a wagon arrives in a city you sell the goods on it and then auction out who'll be the loader/driver on its next trip. The winner loads his wares and can then sell wagon space to the other players, but doesn't have to and can charge one player much more than the others. Expect to hear wails and wild pleadings here. Evil!

You can spend some money to climb the social ladder, but it gets more and more expensive the later you do it in the game. And when you have climbed you have to maintain your position as well which isn't cheap either on the higher rungs.

All in all a fantastic negotiation game that I really appreciate despite my normal aversion to that type of games.

I had been waiting awhile to learn this game.  Probably my expectations were too high.  While I thought it was fun, I was generally disappointed in how it played.  Maybe we missed a rule.  The wagon-master bartering was static as we were not doing too much haggling.  It's hard to explain why it didn't appeal to me.  I guess I expected a euro, deeper in theme...with more strategic options.  This game is all about figuring out mathematically what a good is worth.  And that is very difficult to do because the value it will be sold for is adjusted blindly.  If you don't have one of those cards to adjust the goods marker, it makes it even harder to determine.  I would happily play it again though.  The wooden wagons are a really cool touch.

RATING: 5
Underrated game where players are trying to purchase status on the status track.  Players purchase goods, transport them and try to sell them at a vast profit, allowing the important status purchases.  Lots of typical German game mechanics all thrown together here.  Works well.

RATING: 8
Amazing, fun, tense market-driven game. It has three major sub-games all happening at once - a blind-bidding calculation game to buy the wagons, a negotiation game to load the wagons, then a market manipulation game to deliver goods. Not many games to successfully merge various sub-games together [Power  Grid, Civ, and Dune come to mind]. A must play masterpiece! 




I heard famous rumor this gem was panned at "The Gathering" because they all got the rules wrong then jumped on the smear-campaign bandwagon.

Hopefully this one gets reprinted because it's an interesting game. It looks fairly complex but after a few minutes of playing it you catch on quickly. The length is also just right. I like the "Hare & Tortoise" feel to the victory track as you have to find the right pace or you'll get stuck in the lead watching people pass you or you'll get too far behind not able to catch up.

There are some interesting elements here, and in fact I thought for sure this would be a winner for me and my group, but we soured on it as the length and processional nature sucked the fun out. Too many stops along the way with a different mechanism (blind bidding, standard auction, calculation, negotiation) which stops the flow of the game as players consider the consequences. The result is a stop-start experience heavy on the "stop" part. 

You purchase goods, pay to load them on the carts, move the carts, adjust prices with an eye to screwing the other players, and fight via auction for a share of the 8 permanent bonus cards. When you're done with all that, you have to pay for your social status "upkeep" and then pay to advance your social status (which will result in a higher upkeep cost next turn). This is the clever part of the game as the tension of these priorities makes for a lot of very interesting decisions that go beyond mere pickup and deliver. If the game play flowed more smoothly, this could be an interesting game about managing your social status.

Finally got to play this after owning it for several years. Not fun. A lot of work for not much result. The basic idea and rules are sound, buy goods, auction wagons, move wagons, affect prices, sell goods, buy status. Add to this special powers and more special actions and fairly crude pricing ramps and that's it. All the extra powers and actions mean a lot more reading of rules and maybe today a more elegant method would be used (opportunity cost), but in this game, the rich get richer and only collusion by the poor can delay them and maybe peg them back. But if you're poor, you're gonna stay poor. The only mechanism I'd steal from this game is the wrap-around pricing.

Played once.

  A rather chaotic pick up and deliver game that suffers greatly from a lack of elegance.  It plays like a very promising prototype, burdened with a bunch of ad hoc mechanisms thrown in to raise the complexity, but these additions, such as the courier, are neither truly interesting or fun.

  The ultimate disappointment is that the value of goods isn't tied to any other game mechanism (ideally it would be driven by supply/demand) and is arbitrarily determined by the players.

RATING: 6
I'm not completely disappointed but I'm certainly not overwhelmed with this one.  I'll have to play again and  try other interpretations of the rules.  The translation we used specified the Wagon Arrival chart should advance only once if any wagon arrived during the turn which made the game drag on way past its welcome point.  Redundancy didn't enhance the experience.  The power cards are certainly not all created equal, never mind the printed cost, and auctioning them at the start of the game only seems to make sense if all players fully understand the worth of each.  All in all, ok but nowhere near a classic for me.

After reading the rules, I thought the game seemed rather disjointed and pieced together, but it plays more smoothly than I was expecting.  Very solid, good investment / market game that can be a little unforgiving of mistakes (which I like).  It seems to take just a little longer than it should to play though.

A game which is definitely more about status than trading; and of course the importance of trade lies right there.  I particularly like the negotiation element; negotiate well and you can have a place for your goods on the next wagon out of town, or get a decent price for transporting somebody else's.  Negotiate poorly and your goods will stay put or nobody else pays to use your wagon.

Best of all is the way faces turn ashen when, after banking on income from either loading or delivery, it doesn't come in and their status drops dramatically.

It's a negotiation game. Not purely so as there are some tactical and strategic opportunities in the board play as well, but the negotiations form the largest part of the game and clever board play won't help you much if you do poorly in the haggling department (and that is even though some of the special cards seem to be ridiculously overpowered). What hurts the game most is that it seems quite possible for one or two players with a good start to develop a stranglehold on the game, just as it's easily possible for a player with a bad start to drop out of the running. And in this case this doesn't just mean he is no longer competing for the win but that he won't be doing very much at all.

In any case, there is not a lot of game left without the negotiations so I guess it mostly depends on whether or not you're a fan of the genre. I fairly clearly am not.

I was quite mixed about this one. On the one hand, it is an easy-playing, interesting spin on a negotiation and pick-up-and-deliver game. I really love how it presents with the chunky wooden pieces. However, at the end of the day, it just wasn't the level of "fun" that I expect out of a negotiation and auction game. In fact, they are my favourite genere of games and when a negotiation/auction game doesn't stir the type of great feelings I usually get, I am concerned. I like the freedom of the negotiations, but I think we kept them simple because too many of them would mean we would have to start writing down agreements and what-not. There might also have been a runaway leader problem. Overall, a solid game and different, but if I had to choose an auction or negotiation game, this would not be the first, second, or even third one I would pick up from the shelf.

Die Händler suffered from a strong negative buzz when it first came out, fueled by a critical rules error by those who played it at the Gathering of Friends. Played with the wrong rules, most folks thought the game was pretty bad. The fact that it *looked* so cool and so promising only served to intensify the vehemence of people's negative comments - there was a real sense of letdown. More and more people have come to appreciate Die Händler, played with the correct rules, in recent years. Yet the game has never fully recovered from the initial negative buzz. If you enjoy games that feature a wide variety of interrelated aspects and mechanisms, then you might want to try Die Händler.  My one complaint is that the mechanisms don't flow together quite as smoothly as they could, and I think this is why the game doesn't come off the shelf as often as it should.

I like the fact that you can choose to play with either limited negotiation or full bore.

Reducing the negotiation aspect increases the strategic play and planning. 

Full bore negotiation adds a certain amount of spice that can make or break the game depending on the players.

Some well-known mechanics, but none that I particularly like. It's quite hard to properly evaluate things in the game, and you have to do it all the time with negotiation, blind bidding and a standard auction. The game works and maybe just isn't for me, but the fact is that I find it a little boring and have no interest in playing it again. The theme certainly adds to the boredom. Even the title is boring, but I must concede it fits very well. The artwork is uglier than in the previous version, and the large wooden wagons are not only ugly, but also functionally bad.

I think overall my impression of this game was good.

I enjoy pick up and delivery systems,  But, this game seems to have a high screwage factor, plus a interesting dose of negotiation.  Not a big deal, but I think it will make some games very enjoyable, while other games frustrating.

With the unknown destination, it seems hard to really value a reasonable cost to load.

A gumbo of familiar mechanics comprise what is essentially a series of minigames baked into a market speculation Euro: pickup/deliver, auction, negotiation, blind bidding, buy high/sell low, group think, bluffing.

In theory it seems like an interesting buffet. Then the variable player powers are doled out, and this game morphs into the slogging, Take That, kingmaking, screwage-fest it truly is, with very little control when it matters and much more chaos then what appears to be under the game's hood.

No one at the table was impressed with the variable player power cards. For our game they were randomly assigned (but paired as per the rules), and based on seating order there was a chaining/cascade dynamic occurring with several of the powers (including Office and Courier). Sort of like the Puerto Rico problem. 

More specifically, the Courier seemed hugely overpowered. Especially with our turn order, which meant that two players in succession got to use the Courier effect and stockpile additional power cards. Most of which went unused in the game, incidentally. The other two players had zero chance to take advantage of the Courier's power, so it was an abandoned tactic from turn one that limited their strategy.

The "Office" power that allows a player to move a good up or down on the goods' purchase price/selling price track - and allowing one to "wrap" around (thus deus-ex-mechanizing the highest good to the lowest after all players have chosen) also was another superpower, that basically ended one player's game after the first turn. 

Other power cards are so skimpy as to be useless - the Warehouse Sales basically "rewards" you for inefficiency so is more like an endgame "I have no moves left" tactic, not a winning, gamechanging one. Insult, meet injury if you have this card and are getting abused by Office and Couriers all night. 

This reminds me of another game that may have worn out its welcome and lives on the shoulders of nostalgia - Martin Wallace's "Way Out West." Similar chaos baked in Euro trimmings, and a thief of one's time.

I am glad to have played it for its place in BGG history - barely. But I don't see the appeal, nor is it a game I'm ever going to suggest or play again.

There's a pick-up-and-delivery aspect here, which I always enjoy, but there's also a heavy negotiation/bribery element (and there's another variant to add more aaaaahhhhhhh).

2 cardboard coins of 1000 value
16 cardboard coins of 100 value
12 cardboard coins of 500 value
1 original game sequence chart (replaced with custom-made English one. Looks good though)

Good news is that I've made full color English cards while keeping all original cards in German and laminated them.

Other than these, everything is in like new condition. If you have better coins for your play, it will be ok. You'll never run out all goods markers during your game play.

My first play of this got cut short, so I'm not sure yet what to make of it. Seems half auction/economic, half negotiation/screwage, which totally appeals to me. And yet I have many simpler and shorter games that fill those niches. What I didn't like in MotMA is the special power cards. Seems like you'd need to play a lot to have a good idea how to value them, and in the list of "games I'd like to devote the time to exploring in more depth," after one partial play this one is just not toward the front of the line.

WOW, what a wagon load of FUN! Lots of dirty play in this via negotiations/bribery, market manipulations, special cards and more. I can't imagine a p/u & del game being more fun than this, the theme is very well implemented and the bits are quite nice too. 

With all those mechanics it is a Gamers game and they all flow together beautifully once familiar with the game. A good strategy title with almost no luck, lots to think about but no AP & no downtime, only quibble was the english rules which can be worked out. This might be too hardcore for some but if you like a good "meaty" game with lots of interesting decisions this is a good choice. This will play best with 4 and then 3, sensitive people may not fare well. 

A reprint would be nice but I'm not sure there is a big enough market for it.

[u]UPDATE:[/u] Played this again and loved it as much as the first time. Outside of train games this is THE P/U AND DEL GAME. Very unique, lots of great mechanics beautiful woven together and best of all FUN. Balance is a little questionable re the abilities, more plays will tell but my games have been close so I think it is fine and if not it can be tweaked. While Couriers will be picking up very useful cards, the others have some great control in the market and buying power so it appears to even out. 

A strategy title but maybe not heavy on long term planning via a game long plan ie POF, TAJ, BUT it is there along with short term and fantastic tactics. A stubborn negotiator could spoil the balance but I haven't encountered this and you could say this about any negotiating game (group dependant). Overall the fun comes from the screwage and pushing your luck in the negotiations and seeing how far you can push your opponents, if this doesn't get some laughs, find another group.

A KRAMER MASTERPIECE along with EG, POF, Maharaja and the Mask trilogy

[u]UPDATE:[/u] 9.25 => 8 This is a BIG rating drop for me, especially for something I liked so much out of the gate and after 3 plays. 

Trouble is the last 2 plays really showed me some issues I didn't notice before. One game 2 players ganged up and made sure I got screwed on wagon, a little too much freedom here I don’t know, wasn't the first and only time this has happened either if players want they can really just shut someone down, this is of course kind of group dependant but the rules do allow for it.  Worst however is I realize now the game really should have some tweaks AND we played with the new rules the last game which I am mixed about.  On the one hand, the auctioning of the roles is good giving players more control of what abilities they get but on the other it makes turn order important again and people can end up with even more unbalanced abilites than the orginal game (yes this can be somewhat controlled by the players however). I still really like the game, but I think I would want to play with the following going forward: 

TWEAKS 

 - Play with orginal ability pairs but strengthen the weaker pairs with money compensation (2 pairs are slightly stronger than 2 others, just throw a little money with the weaker ones simple).  

 - Turn order needs to be compensated, going last sees you getting screwed on ties for wagons and courier movement which are both HUGE, this is my biggest gripe.  
Ties being broken by closest to start player just sucks, problem is its hard to come up with a better solution. 

 - Some Card abilities might be a touch too strong and should likely be weakened a little

It's official, a reprint [-]is[/-] was due out April 2009! See http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/3044203#3044203

None of us had played before, but luckily I had already read the rules the day before in preparation, and the rules are relatively easy to go through. Given we were all playing for the 1st time, we didn't use the negotiation variant. We also used the pre-paired up special ability cards, the pairs being randomly distributed.

On the surface it actually looked and felt like Ed's special ability to purchase 3 goods for a total price of just 100, saving him hundreds each round, seemed to be very powerful. Asher and Sarah who both could move the courier also seemed to be very powerful, as except for one I was able to acquire early on, they were the only two who were able to obtain special influence cards.

In the end however, even with what seemed to be the weak driver and large office special abilities, pulled off the win. Though this was probably more to do with Ed deciding not to pay to increase his status by 2 levels as I had done, so when in the next round 2 wagaons arrived and triggered the end game condition, I was already 1 status level higher than anyone else. Ed would have easily won the tie breaker as he had tons of cash in the end, thanks to his Favorable Purchasing ability saving him money every round.

Stop playing the new rules. They are bullshit. If you want to Play a perfect backstabbing and strategic game, then try the older rules from Queen Games. They are much better.Why?
In the recent issue the mechanism was soft flushed now because in each round only one equipment card is still auctioned. Thus, the 8 features cards are gradually brought into play and no longer available from the beginning to all players. That changed the game lasting for the worse.

RATING: 4
Seldomly, a game got me so annoyed. It's probably not so much a function of the game itself but of my mood and dubious player decisions. The main thing which can be blamed on Die Händler is that the game allows to annoy specific players with your decisions which is true for many other games as well. It's probably not as bad as my 4 rating makes it but even without the specific situation, the elements don't fit as a whole and the sum is less than its parts.

While reading the rules, it feels like a mish-mash of mechanisms, but it actually flows quite nicely, and with experienced players could actually play quickly.  I can see how there is the potential for some very cutthroat play, which may bother some players, but it felt appropriate for me.  It takes a while (for me, the entire first game) to learn how to accurately assess the value of bidding to become the wagon master or appropriate prices to demand to load goods.

It's weird seeing the evolution of this game from holy grail to Z-Man trash that they're almost giving away. I really enjoy the brutal, mean nature of the game, though it seems like most don't.

Fun Fact - When I visited, they were selling this game in the gift shop in the monastery at Mont St Michel!

RATING: 7
A economic/negotiation game that has great bits and an interesting theme. This game has much potential for backstabbing and pettiness, but overall it hasn't been too bad. The market-wrapping mechanism is a little odd to me, and I feel some cards are overpowered, but overall, its a solid game to play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Almost exactly like Die Handler with a few small changes. I think I actually prefer the Investment powers the old way. Also, as with all bidding games, without a proper guide most new players are unsure about the value of items and tend to make poor valuations.

Very good game if you like auctions and negotiations.  
Throw in a little back stabbing for good measure. Buy goods for your warehouse.  Load them on the cart and drive it to another town where you can sell it.  How hard could that be?

This is a great game.  I only played one game but really enjoyed the interaction among all the players.  I could see where some people may not like the game.  The game has a high social factor.  Also, it helps to print up the reference aids ( dh_reference.jpg) . I gave one to each person.   This made our game much easier to play the first time.  Everyone could see the turn order and options.  The English card traslation printouts ( Die HandlerCards.zip  )are great.  I just used a glue stick and place them over the German cards.  Overall a highly recommended game for the right group.  It is not a complex game but could be for newbies to gaming.

RATING: 5
An average game at best. I would like to find more challenging and fun things to do other than negotiate myself out of a friendship. Pure business negotiations can be hair raising at times and can cause people to be hurt or angry or worse. This sort of thing must be very carefully dealt with. 9 out of 10 business fail. 9 out of 10 partnerships fail. Thus 9 out of 10 times with game it will cause more hurt than fun. That is NOT why I play games anymore. I never play just so I win. It has to do with the overall enjoyment factor of everyone involved. This game does not allow for that unless everyone is just a pushover, and then what's the point of playing a negotiating game like this at all. 

I will not be playing this one again. Heck, I'll play Monopoly if I want the same feelings that come out of this game. I can have alot of fun playing much better games that everyone has fun with.

SLOOOOOW as a 2 player game. With the right people, this could be fantastic with 4. The advanced variant rules encourage you to just negotiate any and every aspect of the gameplay, so the experience would vary depending on who's playing the game and what kind of mood they're in. The concept of that fluidity of rules makes this one of the purest economic games I've seen.

I'm not a huge fan of pure negotiation games.  This is not pure, but negotiation plays a large enough role that I don't like it.

Update: No need to change rating.  My valuation was x, and other player's evaluation was x+100.  I refused to pay the difference, game over for me.  Unfortunately, since I had similar arguments with the other players, their marginal losses cancelled each other out.  I should have focused on a single player.

So, blind bidding on carriage, yuck.  Negotiation for value of goods, yuck.  Chaotic "value of goods movement", yuck.  Overall, yuck.

A negotiation/trading euro where to buy and deliver goods while trying to influence their value.  Not a lot of randomness but player actions can certainly be unpredictable and make the game somewhat unwieldy.  Initially, you get the impression that there's is more to the game than is really there.  Ultimately, the game will reward cooperation and can leave some gamers unsatisfied with the actual gameplay.  It also has the potential to make people grumpy and blaming others if negotiations don't pan out for them.  In the same vein as Genoa, but a bit more shallow.  Ok game.

Very good strategic economy game. The theme is situated in medieval Europe and you play a merchant who slowly climbs the latter of success from a little merchant up to a seat in the senat. By buying goods and delivering them you earn money. It wins the player who has achieved the highest rank. But be aware, the later you decide to climb the latter, the more expensive it will become. However, the higher you climb, the more expensive are your constant costs of representation. Many elegant mechanisms makes this game such a gem!

Finally played 4 player game 11-06. As an early (earlier?) Euro was very good. 

Two issues: many wouldn't like the goods price adjustment mechanism of each player making hidden choices as to which commodity changes price and the players with the Courier can far more readily avail themselves of the cards granting less expensive upgrades to their staus level.

With those things in mind and the right set of players its is a lot of fun.

Mixed about this one. I like the economic aspects of the game, but I dislike the negotiation part. I never like negotiation in a game. It means you're dependent on favors of your opponents. When you're prone to winning games, you don't get many. Some rolecards are too strong as well.

I have a lot of respect for this game, it's got some great mechanism and one of the coolest pick up and delivery systems I've seen.  However I wasn't too keen on the wagon negotiations and though I liked the idea of the price wheel there didn't seem to be enough control  (or perhaps I just out-guessed myself?  Also, strangely, each player is provided with different "powers".  It's amazing it all works out.  Depending on the group you play with this could be a very nasty game.  Not recommended for newbies.

RATING: 7
Solid economic game with pickup-and-deliver mechanisms that feels like a much earlier version of Panamax. In fact, this game feels like the precursor to many designs, including Black Fleet and Genoa. The game feels very mathy, but it comes together pretty well. Unfortunately, the game does feel a bit dated at this point. The carts move around the board at a snail's pace, and the structure of every round is a bit long. At the same time, this does harken back to a time of some really solid, classic Euros, like Puerto Rico and one of Kramer's other games, Princes of Florence. In fact, I got a very strong PoF vibe in playing this, though the negotiation does help to set this one apart to some degree. This is certainly a very solid game considering its age, but it doesn't have the flashiness that modern designs have. Still, this is probably one of Kramer's better big box games I've played. Great economy, great negotiation, and lots of ways to mess with your opponents.

Buy commodities, bid on wagons to deliver them, then sell goods to get money and increase one's social status in medieval times. It's okay, but the mechanic at price adjustment phase where everyone dials in two commodities, it's literally in the hands of a deity. The problem is if you cross the top price, you go back down to the bottom, and the "kontor" abilities aggravate the price setting. It is also too long, most games take at least two and a half hours. It feels like it belongs at a higher tier of ranked games, but I cringe whenever I see this game.

Non un capolavoro ma un gioco che si lascia giocare volentieri e per nulla banale.

Might be best as 2 or 3-p. MMA seems quite random with larger groups. Some of the bonus abilities are much more powerful than others, and this is not completely balanced by the auction. Can be a matter of being in the right place when they appear; with 4-5 players that often seems to be luck, rather than good management.
Rated 5 or 6 after ~ half-a-dozen plays.
Must try again with fewer players.

RATING: 4
Merchant of the Middle Ages takes a fairly euro-ish pick-up-and-deliver game and throws in a bunch of mechanics that most eurogamers (including me) tend not to like.  Players are trying to put their goods on one of three wagons, move that wagon to another city, and then sell the goods at a higher price.  However, only the wagon-master can decide how the wagon is loaded, and that priviledge is auctioned via blind bidding.  The other players must then bribe the wagon-master to load their goods, and the wagon-master is free to refuse any bribe.  Prices of goods can be raised each turn by simultaneous action selection using a wheel, and if a good increases off the end of the chart, it resets to the lowest price.  There is also a Power Grid-style auction for special abilities, in which all the players except one can buy one.  There's also a mechanic for getting one-time action cards by moving a Courier token, but that just felt a little wonky.  This game seems to go out of its way to include mechanics I don't enjoy.  I won't be playing it again.

Have played once, and I think it's another fine game from Kramer.  A nice blend of working on the here and now and the future.  The various house power cards are interesting and aid in building strategy without seeming too powerful in any one direction, though I felt that sometimes turn order aided people unduly during our game.  The wagon components are cool and useful.  As the game is in German, there is a bit of tedious downtime waiting for folks to decipher the translations when choosing action cards.  Nice balance of going for money and going for the win (and going for both at the same time, of course) much like Princes of Florence.  Most short-term goals take a whole turn or two to come to fruition, though, something I enjoyed. I've heard it only works with 4.

An overrated early Kramer/Ulrich pick up and deliver game. I love Kramer's games but this one is overly chaotic due to factors such as the highly asymmetrical player roles, the Influence cards, and the price wheel. The price of a good can go from lowest to highest or vice versa at the whim of the player who happens to be lucky to get the Gross Kontor role. Add to that the wild auctions for the Gross Wagnerei.

Over all, this is a loose, inellegant, and chaos driven game with little control.

This was a really rough pickup and deliver game. The core idea is good, and similar to Panamax. You have these three nice wooden carts that players place their goods into, and then players get to move whichever of the carts they want during their opportunity to move. This means you are moving goods of both yours and your opponents. The part that makes this game nasty is that each turn, each cart in a city gets auctioned off to a player who then gets to load more, and force other players to pay them money to put their goods onto the cart. What happens next is that the goods are worth different amounts in different cities, sometimes significantly more. Carts once moved can't turn around, so players are angling their movements to get a cart with their goods to the city that will give them the most, while other player's goods might fetch a very small price. These two things make knowing how much money you'll have on a turn very unpredictable. The final nail in the coffin is that after all this happens, there are incredibly overpowered ability cards up for auction. These cards are extremely game warping and give the whole experience a feeling of extreme futility.

Fun and interesting negotiation/management game. The idea of the carts is really neat, and the point mechanism is also a very clever idea.

Savage game of manipulation, bluff, deceit, and outmaneuver. Crazy. I love this game.

RATING: 6
Like the combination of pick-up and logistics.  Some nice touches in the game design also.  The highest goods purchase price is less than the lowest goods sales price - so should always make money on a deal provided the transportation costs don't eat into that profit.  I like the fact that upkeep and advancement gets more expensive as one moves up while the income tends to stay relatively constant - nice twist from the the usual "rich get richer" style of economic development.  Game can appear chaotic with all the price changes and ability to move any wagon - but think this shows that players need to balance cooperation with competition in the game.  While the rules look long and intimidating, the mechanics aren't that hard to understand - just step through the phases and the game will flow rather smoothly.  Nice wooden bits also!

There was a lot of cool stuff going on, and some stuff that seemed a little off. It didn't have the elegant feel that I generally see in Kramer games. It is one of the nicest looking games I have ever seen, and its one I really want to like. I would need to play it again to see how well a second play would change my initial feelings.

RATING: 8
--May2008-- Finally got it to the table:  thanks, Joe and Robert!  It's a rush:  the first play hinted at a lot of only partially explored havoc that will require several subsequent plays to plumb.  The variable player powers swing one's strategy to a great degree - and, again, I only begin to perceive the possibilities of auctioning those powers at the beginning of the game.  It's a bit too bad I didn't buy this one in '99: I didn't own that many games then, and might have been able to play it several times in succession - which is really what it needs.
--Nov2009-- After a few more plays, it still amuses.  This is the first time I've had neither a driver nor courier power, and I was surprised that the game still seemed as capriciously balanced as ever.  I still think this really needs multiple plays over a short period of time in order to build up a procedural lexicon among the participants:  the game is too sloppily open-ended in the first couple turns without that context.

RATING: 8
This is a really nice pick up and deliver game with some interesting auction mechanics and some solid variable abilities.
Wile some hate the idea of the special powers, I really enjoy them and think that they add a great amount of replayability.  They basically break rules and for that, purity gamers will give this one the cold shoulder...  I like to think that they just add a level of difficulty and chaos that take an extra effort to combat.

My main complaint with this is that it is limited to four players...  I think this game could hold a 5th.

RATING: 7
Simple and straight forward game of producing and getting the goods delivered to sell them for profit, with some negotiation thrown in the middle. Nevertheless, the scoring mechanism is not based only in accumulating money, as may expected, but in growing social status in a clever way, cause the price to do so rises exponentially as commerce is being made. The carriages to transport the goods are used by all the players, which promote some negotiation between them.

This rating may well go up with more plays. Auctions, dealing, negotiation, screwage, tight economics, and the threat of a terrible downfall always looming. Mr. Kramer: I love you. 

(The card powers seem fairly imbalanced, so auctioning them off is the only way to play this.)

Excellent game with outstanding components and various mechanics. Auctions - NEGOTIATIONS - Movements - Price modification(no matter what others say, you CAN predict the outcome and it is one of the most interesting aspects of the game) - THEME(you atually feel like a merchant trying to survive in the fierce competition of the market) and bonus cards.
The game has it ALL and of course STRATEGY, which is always there, behind every move and negotiation...
Keep in mind that our first play took around 4-5 hours:( but it worth the effort. After that every game is around 2 hours depending on the amount of negotiations, leaving everyone with the feel of playing a "TOTAL" game...
Highly recommended!

Certainly one of the most sadly overlooked games in the cannon.  What a blast.  Easily one of the nastiest economic negotiation Euros this side of Intrige.  Tons of laughs.  I'm not sure how balanced this game is (which is why it gets a 9 rather than a 10), but the level of fun that I have overrules whatever I'd be concerned about while forced to eat my ass from a chafing dish.  I'm not sure if it would work well with less than 4 players, but with 4 it is incredible.  Good luck tracking this one down, it is a must in any collection.

Die Haendler rocks my ass off.  We played for the first time at BGG.con, and I loved it throughout.  I like the combination of auction & negotiation, though I'm torn because it's blind auction rather than escalated bidding, but I guess that works out for the situation. I have an English rules translation, and it seems that the turn order is preserved despite player status, but since I haven't played it more than once, I don't know how that affects the game overall.  I like the player abilities, but it does seem that the courier may be a bit overpowered, as people have noted elsewhere, since those with the courier ability seem to have better option to pick up the green cards, which can have quite an impact on the game.  I look forward to further plays on this one.

Great competition game, not to rules heavy - making it light enough to bargain & compete with others in different ways. Liked how the market prices can fluctuate on the influences of all players, the bidding mechanism, being the load master (even if you don't have goods in the city you can still participate - potentially). Fun

After one play I keep wavering between a 7 and 8.  I love the economic aspects and the auctions.  On the other hand, negotiation games aren't usually my thing because the most dominant personality tends to win out.  That problem isn't as pronounced here though.  Another plus is I kept thinking about it the next day, always a very good sign.  Our first game clocked in a little too long, so I can see it moving up once the game length shortens a little.  I want to play again soon!

I played die handler once a couple of years ago and liked it a lot. It was, truly, a great experience. Merchants of Middle Ages, although it is the same game, and maybe because times have changed a bit for me and my tastes, I didn't have the same challenging and interesting experience. It still is a neat game but it't not the game I remembered. It has a few things I don't like very much being the card that can change the market from the highest position to the lowest (can't remember its name) the most problematic one. Mainly because it adds too much chaos!
A keeper, nevertheless!

A clever pick-up and deliver game by the team that brought us El Grande and Princes of Florence. This game has some more sharp edges to it, and possible unbalances with the special powers. It does have a bit of a learning curve. Also, it doesn't work quite as well with 3 as it does with 4.
Still, a very entertaining game that I should play more often.

RATING: 8
[Queens Game 1999 edition] {Merchant, Europe; pick-up-and-deliver, commodity speculation, negotiation, bidding, blind-action selection; optimal 4p} {basic 8, advanced 8} I like business-like game and Die Händler got my attention for its unique theme (be a successful trader in the land), mechanics and nice appearance. It is unique because it involves a rich set of mechanics and theme that you hardly find in other games. Normally, for a business name, the winner would usually be the one with most gold/money. But in Die Händler, the winner is someone with the highest social status, which is working surprisingly well.

Die Händler is a fairly difficult multifaceted game and is thus only suitable for veteran players. Players need to plan wisely and take care of many things: social status, route planning, commodity, trading, money, etc. However, it doesn't seem complicated because Die Händler is very intuitive.

There is very strong player interaction so players shall always pay attention to the game. It can be quite nasty and vicious as well; there are ways that a player can directly hurt the growth of another player; esp. in bidding as load master, wagon movement, and market price changes. There is no luck in this game and players have fairly strong control. Besides, a player has to work well with other players to make huge profit.

Die Händler is nicely designed and balanced. There are built-in controls to keep the leader from running away without strong bashing-the-leader problem. The role cards are nicely designed but players need a few games to understand how to utilize the roles most effectively. It is dynamic and various strategy/tactics are needed during different stages of the game.

In all, Die Händler is a decent merchant game, where players will find loads of fun and enjoyable moment. I am lucky that I got a copy while it's OOP.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
After many plays using the basic rules, I strongly like this game. Die Handler certainly will not be for everyone due to the directly negotiations and screw your neighbor aspect, but the people I play with are tough skinned, making this a real gem of a game.

There is no doubt that the best player will win the game.  I would rate this game higher if the game were released in English.

Probably the best euro game that is not widely acclaimed as a "great game".  In other words, Die Handler is probably the best game you never heard of.

Update 12/2007 upgraded to a NINE I really like this game,  unfortunately my friends have taken to ganging up against me, which did of course point out on of the obvios flaws.   I still enjoy the challenge.

The basic game of trading in Merchants of the Middle Ages is demanding.  There's a lot to watch: 6 cities, 3 goods per city, and wagons that may travel anywhere.

It's just too much to assess, and the winner will simply manage their cash best among the chaos.

Merchants of the Middle Ages is played over several rounds, each round with action phases. In these phases, players will purchase goods from the cities on the board and store them in their warehouses, auction wagons for moving the goods, load goods onto the wagons, move the wagons toward other cities, alter the price of the goods and ultimately sell the goods when the wagons arrive at a destination. Along the way, players acquire investment cards that give them special abilities through various phases of the round, and influence cards for one-time bonuses. The whole purpose of buying and selling goods is to acquire money that players use to elevate their social status, for it is social status and not money that is the ultimate determinant of who is the greatest merchant.

RATING: 5
Meh. The basic mechanisms are not too bad, except that the blind bidding works as well as it generally does when the value of the lot is subject to extreme fluctuation, i.e. not very well at all. The special powers add a lot of cruft which damages the game - e.g., price changing becomes an exercise in trying to keep prices you care about in the middle, if you don't have a Kontor power. Not much fun. Might be worth playing again with Derek Carver's variant (throw out the powers and the influence cards, swap the order of price changing and selling, start players with 7000 marks), but I'm in no great rush to.

This game lies outside my normal preferences. By reading the rules I can see elements of cooperation and chaos that I am generally not at all fond of.  But I am attracted to the status ladder and the possiblity that you can tumble if you don't pay the annual dues, plus also the market pricing that rises with scarcity of delivery. The conflict between those opposing forces of like/dislike can only be satisfied by trying some actual gameplay.

This one seemed very unbalanced, especially the player abilities.  Of course I played it very poorly from the get go so that may color my feelings.  Also bidding and negotiating are key aspects to the game and too mechanisms I neither like nor do well.  The courier part of the game seemed exceptionally useless. Basically you want the ability that lets you ignore purchase cost, the one that lets you manipulate price with wrap around, the one that lets you move carts.  Beyond that take control of the wagons and it seems like the game is won.  All those aspects of the game are out of whack.  But many people seem to like it so again, it could be I just played poorly.

Aside from the wooden carts, an eminently skippable game.  Uninteresting and overdone theme, paired with a mishmash of mechanics. Negotiation, pick-up and deliver, and markets all play a part, but this particular combination doesn't take proper advantage of any of the strengths.

And I'm just not that wild about negotiation games.  I can respect the design, but I can't see myself playing it very often.

Very engrossing game of negotiations and money management.. time flew by, had alot of fun.. experienced players has an edge if played with newbies however, although our game was fairly close.. very nice components with wagons and nice looking goods (although bringing up the cost of the game)

Very tight game with a nice blend of mechanics (economic system, pick-up and deliver, variable powers, transportation...). I've only played it 2 player but an very eager to play a 4 player game. Rating could go up but won't certainly go down.

Inspired game with original mechanics, but ultimately too uneven.

after 1st game have a reserved feeling about the mechanics. somewhat chaotic & unpredictable. has only had the one play as well...
2nd play with 4 better. Would like to attempt the play without the standard role setup and utilise the  auction method to obtain roles. Also think a set price variant for placing goods on the wagons may speed up play somewhat.

very nice components, intellegent mechanisms and design, but not for the timid, as both times i have played, people end up mad at each other.  you could play the "kind" variation (no negotiation), but this sort of rips the heart out of the game.  played with the right people (those who enjoy negotiation, and understand what a commodity is worth), this game is a 9.

Variable cost resources, pick-up-and-deliver, a blind bid, an open bid, ability cards, open negotiation, money management...it's all here... fun, but a bit hazy when it comes to evaluating cost/return ratios... also, it can be a little cut-throat and very frustrating when other players make it difficult to make your plans come to fruition...

I haven't played this yet but it looks like a decent resource management type game.

"Jack of all trades, master of none."  If there is a game that is guilty of too many mechanics, Die Handler is definitely it.  It has variable powers, market manipulation, commodity speculation, pick up and deliver, negotiation, blind bidding and simultaneous action selection.  No wonder the rules reading took such a long time.

This is definitely not for the faint of heart, with so many different gameplays to juggle, I can imagine being overwhelmed very easily.  Unfortunately, I don't think Die Handler implemented any one idea particularly well, so what we were left with is a really busy game that have the appearance of meaningful decisions, but in the end is really about who can manipulate the cart (and his opponents) to his advantage.  Beautiful production but definitely overrated.  I'd rather be playing something that focuses on one or two mechanics and is able to perfect them, instead of an average one with a mishmash of designs.

Pick up and deliver economic game.  Players buy goods from one city at a set price; then players sell these goods at another city that demands it (or maybe not) and then use this money to buy social status (aka reputation) but this reputation has an upkeep per round.

One can climb the reputation ladder by paying a set fee, or double the fee to climb two spots.  The cost of this is set and raised by the number of truck deliveries are made.

3 Trucks in the game and each player can move any truck he likes using movement tokens.

To get goods on the truck, players bid to become load-master; and others then pay him to load said goods onto the truck.

Its a good game, a bit too long; you can always play to less rounds.  Its gone a bit old compared to other games and you're always making money on goods (to an extent)

Other than that, its a reasonable game to play.  Just be aware it can be a bit long

The economy and trading of everything is good fun.  The game always seems to end after so few turns, but I suppose that keeps me coming back for more.  ;^)

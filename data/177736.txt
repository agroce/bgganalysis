A fantastic creation with top quality components.  I appreciate the skill of the designer to craft something so spectacular and with such a broad scope, but for me there's too much in the game.

With four of us it took 4 hours to play 7 rounds, plus an hour for setup and going through the rules.  Not the 120 mins it says on the box then.

The worker placement spaces are so numerous and the choices of direction you can take so varied, we hardly ever got in each other's way.  There was almost no player interaction for the whole game.

We simply pursued different strategies, in the main initially guided by our first occupation.  I mostly went whaling, another player focused on taking items from the Special Board, the third mostly went hunting/snaring while the fourth concentrated on emigration: building and flipping ships to score big points each time.  No-one explored islands.

Three of us ended the game with incomes of 18 and fully covered player boards, feeling therefore we'd done reasonably well - but the winner had an income of 2 with a partially covered board and a final score virtually twice that of any of the rest of us.

His initial occupation was one which gave a discount on emigration.  So he pretty much ignored putting anything onto the main part of his board and just repeated the cycle of paying 2 wood to build a knarr/longship and then paying 3/6 coins to emigrate and turn it into 18/21 points.

So the three of us at the end of the game could say "Yay, I filled my board and it scored 18 points!".   Meanwhile the emigrator lost around 25 points from it but scored nearly 120 from the six emigrated ships - each of which had helped him in-game by reducing the distraction of having to provide for the feast in every round.

The tetris element of fitting differently colored shapes onto your board was mostly tiresome for me.  It was error prone while you tried out 3 or 4 pieces in different arrangements (and what-ifs for whether you'd promote this one or that one to blue) - after a while you think did I try out 3 or was it 4 pieces?  Should I be taking back 3 or 4 to consider other arrangements?  Oops.

A great game, but not one I'd particularly want to play again and I'm glad it wasn't me who parted with Â£80 for it.

[I]tl;dr - A Feast for Odin is a needlessly complex game--it has an interesting puzzle, and I'd maybe even like to play it again, but it'll never be a favorite.[/I]
[COLOR=#CCCCFF]____________________________[/COLOR]

I [i]hated[/i] A Feast for Odin the first time I played it -- and yet, like Agricola -- it's kind of lingered in my mind in the time since. This is a very complex game with a lot going on, but my second play helped me to see 'the systems behind the systems' and understand the point of the game a little better. 

At its heart, this is still an optimization game, and it still feels like there's a lot of needless obfuscation in the mechanics, but it's at least inoffensive. And the puzzle does have that little knife twist that keeps you thinking about how you could have played better after you finish playing. 

I'd still take [thing=120677][/thing] or [thing=144733][/thing] over it any day, though.

"Direct" player interaction almost absent. Games is a collection of interesting puzzles that makes it also a good solo example. Interaction should come from peeping onto other boards, searching for mistakes, bragging and chating.

Pro: Filling up the board with tiles to get little bonuses is very satisfying. I still don't feel like I have a grasp on this game after several plays.

Con: The box says 30 minutes per player, but we always end up at an hour per player with two players. I wish there was something to do with unwanted weapon cards.

LIKE: The tile-laying puzzle element was a very involved, but excellent mechanism. I liked the different worker actions, they seemed well designed. There was almost a narrative arc to them. So many paths to explore. I felt some competition for certain spots and to claim bounties, which added a nice player tension.

DISLIKE: Too many options, at first. But as I went through the motions, I could see the different elements and efficient combos unfold. There is some die rolling randomness, and it is possible to have a poor turn. Some cards drawn are better than others, but this is minor.

OVERALL: Uwe is a master of great worker placement spectacles with incredible amount of paths-- or so it seems. Time will tell if there's a path in this game that's most efficient, but the player interaction on the board did feel competitive enough to directly slow another player down (just a little bit).

RATING: 6
I know there are folks who like these sprawling Uwe games, but this one at least to me took it a step too far. I'm up for complexity, but this is sprawling complexity - a multitude of action spots "just because" is the feel I have when playing. It feels like a Kickstarter game where it met too many stretch goals. It is impossible to get new players to go in with you due to the intimidation of this aspect - it just looks  too complex. Also, the mechanics of covering spots with resource tiles is overly thinky - as if it were complexity for complexity's sake and frankly has little to do with the theme whereas the action spots do feel quite thematic. I like this game and would play it again, but I think it's going to leave my collection. It just doesn't fit.

RATING: 5
I really love the Viking theme and this tetris puzzle Uwe offers us in Feast for Odin. But that is as far as my love goes. The decision tree is just too vast and the actions available are just too many to my liking. Everything is available to you right from the very start of the game which is just overwhelming at first. Players are doing the same things every round and there is a less prominent dramatic arc to the game. This would not be a problem if the game had a really original feel to it so that you would be interested in learning all the secrets and finer nuances of the game, but in the end Feast for Odin just another exercise of gathering resources and converting them to other resources two to three times before scoring. Moreover, if you compare the game with Agricola for example, engine building elements are more random since you are not guaranteed to get more than one occupation card over the course of the game and many of them do not necessarily support any specific strategy. Thus game to game variation is not necessarily there.

Now the game is just ok in my book. I could play it occasionally but have no interest in investing more time in it than what is absolutely necessary.

RATING: 9.7
An excellent game, and strong contender for my favorite Rosenberg (I need to play more of this and [i]Ora et Labora[/i], preferably in close succession, to determine the undisputed Rosenberg favorite).  The game seems much more complex on the surface than what it actually is, notwithstanding the plethora of worker placement spaces.  I love the puzzle aspect of the tile placement, particularly as it relates to balancing bonuses and income on both the home board and one or more exploration boards, all the while trying to minimize or eliminate negative points at the end of the game.

That said, even at higher player counts, I've not found it particularly difficult to at least fill player boards such that one is not taking many (if any) negative points, so the game becomes more an exercise in how efficiently one can manage the goods collection/placement mechanics (which is a good thing since many players I play with wouldn't view a game kindly that gives them -20 points at the end of the game for unfilled spaces).  In other words, you need to play this game well to not waste too many silver pieces filling up your home or exploration boards (and thus not leaving many gaps that need filling when you are placing larger tiles, since the silver itself counts as positive points at game end), as well as not too aggressively wasting actions to convert tiles to their blue "luxury" classification (as ultimately a good mixture of blue and green tiles can be used to fill a board at a cost of fewer actions than a board filled all with blue tiles).  

I wasn't as bothered by the randomness of the weapon draws as other players (and reviewers) seemed to be (as there are plenty of probably more efficient things to do than the hunting mini-games anyway), but the occupations have the potential to be swingy.  Once game I had an occupation that allowed me to convert my leftover weapons into ore, which was infinitely more useful.  Another player got an occupation that allowed less expensive emigration.  Certain occupations are certainly much more powerful/useful than others, but I haven't found them game breaking.  The viability of so many different strategies simply makes incorporating (or ignoring) occupations part of the overall efficiency puzzle.  I'm not sure I've had a game yet where the winner/loser was determined largely by the luck of the occupation draw.

The greatest works collection of Uwe Rosenberg!  Oddly enough, this translates into a rather good game.  The core goal is simple enough to grok, but the mechanisms to accomplish that goal are varied and plentiful.  I like how even though this is worker placement, there is enough to do that while other players will constrain some of your choices, you will find options and openings to pursue.  It's tight enough to be a great game but loose enough to lack that super-frustration (a la Agricola).  A really nice gem of a game though a tad on the long side for my tastes.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
The "Patchwork" mechanism (I know he actually developed this game first!) is so cleverly used!  The worker placement board is fun to use, thanks to the decision of how many workers to send to any one spot. More workers = bigger actions!  I look forward to working through this one for years to come!

RATING: 5
1st play: Uwe may have finally broken his streak for me. Caverna and Fields of Arle were pretty open and Sand-boxy but Odin seems quite a bit more open. What may make it worse is that one path vs another really might not matter much because they're all just about getting squares to cover scoring slots on the home board. I'm hoping this game does better in the 2nd play, but so far the upgrading of goods feels unthematic and there isn't much narrative here.

2nd play: I think the biggest thing that holds Odin back is that there really isn't a sense of progression in the game. The first round is the same as the last. In all of his other games there is a beginning, middle and end, either with which buildings are available to buy, which spaces are available or, like in arle, a summer and a winter season. Odin is just 7 rounds of exactly the same thing. This makes it feel less like a narrative game and more like a point salad. I've always felt like one of the big things that separated Uwe games from Feld games is that Uwe's games feel like I'm experiencing the growth of my board and the passage of time. At the end of Odin, I look down at my board and it's a bunch of pelts and silverware and treasure covering up the board, but I couldn't tell you which came from what or why.

I kindof like the action selection thing, with multiple vikings doing stronger actions, but all of the different systems in the game just feel like he threw too much in. As a result most of them aren't very developed. Animal Husbandry is a perfect example of this, it's something where you get 2 sheep, and then don't touch them again until the end of the game. It's pretty mish-mashy and unfocused.

:arrowE: [u]Synopsis[/u]:
Uwe Rosenberg departs from primarily-agricultural settings to explore the rise of several Norse clans. Players focus on acquiring polyomino goods tiles which they slap down onto their home board or explored island boards to trigger bonus resource production, silver income, and eventually, victory points. Goods can be acquired through hunting, whaling, trading, raiding, plundering, crafting etc... Occupation cards help to funnel or reinforce strategy along certain paths and after seven (or six) rounds, the victor is she who best manipulated the game state to her advantage.

:arrowE: [u]What I like most[/u]:
There was a lot of trepidation surrounding this game before release, with outcries of "Rosenberg has gone too far." "It's just all of his mechanics in a big pile." "It's a bloated game without focus." "Too much sand in the sandbox." Well, I considered all of these criticisms and you know what? They're all incorrect. Here's a secret: Uwe Rosenberg is a master. His games [i]appear[/i] similar due to theme and general idea, but they are [i]very different[/i] from each other in execution, mechanisms, and decision points. A Feast for Odin is no different. This game is not a bloated sandbox, but a razor-sharp canvas on which your attention to strategic detail decides if you win or lose. Players can't just do whatever they want, as a keen opponent can use the action selection to block others and still gain benefits for themselves, or take the same objective goods through contrasting means. There is a big gambling streak in this game, too, through the use of building up fleets of ships and exploring. Do you take on two islands and potentially bomb through negative points, or do you manage those islands and turn them into powerhouse production nodes before the game clock runs out? Does your opponent craft and trade for all of the blue goods you've just spent your time building an expensive longship to raid and plunder? Ach! So many hard choices. So many GOOD choices. 

:arrowE: [u]What I like least[/u]:
The dice make a lot of sense in this game. I really do believe this. However, if someone attempts whaling/trapping/raiding early in the game without many weapons, they may be out of luck. Rosenberg built many consolation rewards to these failed endeavors, but sometimes two re-rolls and all of your weapons don't cut it. [i]C'est la vie[/i].

RATING: 6
Essentially the mechanics of Caverna, Agricola and Le Havre combined with some dice rolling and a critically important "Tetris puzzle" that you MUST solve in order to win, which I did on first play in our very long four player game.   

I liked the theme, art, cards and the traditional Uwe worker placement ideas here, but I found the dice rolling and Tetris challenge to be only moderately interesting.  Why are we playing Tetris with our finished goods (blue and green) tiles?  What is the thematic sense of this?  Who cares: don't you like to play Tetris? Not really.  Because I am conspicuously ambivalent about wanting to play Feast again, I guess I have to give it a 6 at best.

Still, there is a certain charm to Fields, and as I pondered the sense of playing Tetris with finished Viking goods on my land board(s), I began to muse (hallucinate?) about a possible thematic explanation for this.  

Hmm....maybe what I am doing in this game is creating interesting viking things (artifacts!), then dropping them or burying them on my land, such that archeologists, far into the future, can find work digging them up and studying my ancient viking culture.  I am helping people to find work far into the future.  

And because the designated "orange" and "red" goods are so perishable, they won't last long enough when buried in my land to allow these future archeologists can find them.  Thus, the rule in Feast against burying them on your land.

By contrast, Feast properly rewards me for producing and carefully burying "green" and "blue" things on my land so that the archeologists have a better chance of finding them in the distant future.  Yes, that's it!  Everything eventually returns to the land, obviously, and long lasting things are better, at least for archeologists curious about me and my culture.  Hmmm....I like it.  Maybe I will play again so I can bury more goods.

A complex Uwe "farming" game, reminiscent of Fields of Arle. The now familiar, expanded Rosenberg action board but this time combined with a clever (too clever?) solo puzzle. This game will undoubtedly reward repeat play but the complexity, chrome and terrible rulebook will get in the way of an enjoyable first experience for most. Highly recommend learning the game from a seasoned player as opposed to learning from the 3 rulebooks (yikes).

Potential to climb but uncertain whether I'm willing to invest the time and money in a copy.  I'd likely trade Agricola or Caverna for this.

I hesitated on this one due to the Patchwork-style player boards and the miss that was Fields of Arle. I was more than pleasantly surprised by the game. The game play is less plodding than Fields of Arle, while still providing a large number of paths to explore (though at the expense of the size of the rule set). The puzzle of the player board is actually pretty enjoyable and, due to the green vs. blue placement rules, adds an interesting way to implement resource conversion. The dice and the paths through the game (e.g., grabbing new player boards, emigrating, etc) are well integrated into the game's decision space and cause the various paths to feel meaningfully different from each other. Further, it has just enough variability via the cards that you look forward to playing again. This game can suffer from down time if a player is too slow in selecting the next move, but on average the play time feels about right. It's the best multi-player solitaire game that I've played, which is a testament, because if I look at a number of the aspects in isolation, they are far from what I typically want in a game. If I was to mention its biggest weakness, is that it feels solvable -- it'll take you a long time to fully develop the decision tree, but that feeling is present.

This is a humongous sandbox. The amount of actions is staggering and there's so many different strategies to go for. It's a worker placement game and it's not that tight but the stress comes from managing all the negative points and income from your own board. Really keen to play more and explore different strategies to the game. I like how streamline the rules were when despite the plethora of options and it's quite easy to grasp after one or two rounds.

First Play: Explaining the game is a challenge and even once you start the options with the action phase are dizzying. There might well be many synergies and optimum plays but they are not apparent after one play. Played long but we all wanted to play again.

It's an okay game, but an excellent puzzle. In a two-player scenario, though, that's all it is. Two people playing alone; there's enough actions to get around any trouble. Bet I'd enjoy it more as a solo.

This was pretty awesome! 2 player game, I finished with an astounding score of -6 (yes, that's a negative) while the winning score was 36. I see now more of the strategy here as you need to decide early to cover your income track (which makes it easier to fill up your main board) and get islands for income or try for high income. Playing it again tonight (1/7) and hoping for a positive score this time. EDIT from my Geeklist entry above; I have played this 4 times total now and it just gets better each time. There really is many strategies you can take in this and still do really well. I had my first game (against Flo) where I was able to fill up my main board. Super fun!

There are a myriad of options and puzzle solving mechanics that the game tosses at you. "Sandbox" and "repetitive" were phrases that were used various times during our initial game. If you enjoy the resource conversion and efficiency exercises that a lot of Euros bring, then you'll enjoy this title. 

I thought that the game, at four players, took too long for what it was. Then again, at three players, it would be less tense then it already is??? The amount of interaction is a lot less than Agricola and, to a lesser extent, than Caverna. The amount of action spaces and components look daunting at first, but once you road test a couple of rounds it all falls into place. It's an okay game and a good pastime when I'm in the mood for some puzzle solving.

All of this said, I've caught myself thinking about the game and what I would do differently afterwards. So; it does hold my interest.

Update: 

It has gotten tighter and more interesting after several more plays. Raised a quarter point.

For me, this is the best overall game of Uweâs recent âsandboxâ style games (Caverna, Fields of Arle, Feast for Odin). The first two I ended up trading away after a few plays because they didnât hold me interest. However, the puzzle aspect in this one and the feeling of purpose it provides seems to be keeping my interest much more. While there are tons of action spaces, I love the idea of 4 varying âpowersâ for each action that cost an increasing number of Vikings. This really makes you feel that you are making meaningful decisions that will affect your end game. The âluckâ mechanics featuring dice are heavily mitigated and really more of a âhow greedy do you want to beâ mechanism than anything else. The game succeeds in its goal to feel like an epic. My only complaint (which many others have stated) is that the occupation cards feel a bit too random. It seems that there are just so many that players are more just hoping to luck into drawing one to work with their strategy. I think eventually we will use a variant so that each player drafts their own private deck of 10-15 cards that they will draw form during the game. It would add 5-10 mins to set up, but I think really pay off in terms of strategic gameplay.

Note: My copy had 4 boards misprinted. I have contacted Z-Man for replacement parts (12/14/16)

This is one of my favourite designs ever. At first I was a bit sceptical due to the sheer amount of worker placement spots, but everything comes together in a very clever way and there is much to discover in this big box. There could be more islands, though - once you figure out your favourite islands it can become just a little bit repetitive + the cards do not add enough variety in my opinion, as most of them are not as influential as in Agricola. Eagerly waiting for an expansion! Got the mini expansion with two additional Islands at Essen.

People seem to refer to this game as having aspects of Agricola and Patchwork. After having played this once I can see why. First, the artwork style is similar. And there is certainly an Agricola vibe going on, but luckily this game doesn't have the pressing of scarcity and famine of Agricola. Sure, you need to prepare an increasingly grand geast each round, but it's always managable. The patchwork part is the actual goal of the game; Tile-laying akin to Tetris.

Feast of Odin is an overwhelming game. It has tiles in dozens and dozens of forms and colours. It has resources (but only four types). It has dozens and dozens of action fields to choose from where you can collect or convert tiles and resources in some form. It has weapon cards (four types), it has hundreds of bonus cards divided in three categories, there are ships in three types. You have up to 12 workers to place, making the choice of one of the dozens of action fields even harder. There are even multiple playing boards to acquire in addition to the one you start with.

So much stuff.

Luckily the core is pretty simple. You want tiles to cover up empty spaces. That's basically it. The thinking part isn't so much how you want the tiles to fit, although that's a fun puzzle element. But the real AP moments are setting up the economic engine of upgrading the stuff you've accumulated in order to have more tiles use. The random bonus cards give you some strategic direction, which is helpful when you play the game for the first time.

After playing this once, I like to explore more. But our first game with three took over four(!) hours. That's a lot. It were fun hours though.

Hmm, need to try this before buying - I suspect it won't be to my tastes given what I thought of Caverna, but there again I liked Ora et Labora (and Agricola) ...

*** Update, played few times now, nothing here that really grabs me. Multiplayer solo puzzle, how to efficiently get the bits to then fit on your board, or boards if you go down one of the get more boards routes. It's a Euro, so while there is some theme there are elements that don't make much sense, and crucially it's the central part that falls down here. Why am I putting all this stuff on my board? Why can't Green touch Green but Blue can touch blue. Not all the conversions make much sense either (especially green to blue). So I'm sure Euro gamers will love it, for me it's a bit meh.

Much preferred patchwork for the central fit stuff on my board mechanic.

It's like Caverna ON TOP OF another game! The "other game" is also good but it's not very thematic at all.

This is more (this is absolutely not the right word but) "exciting" than Caverna. That being said, Caverna is the quintessential worker-placement game.

Playing solo is actually equally as good as playing multiplayer! That's a RARE feat in boardgames that are not mainly/solely meant to be played solo.

I would recommend getting this game even if the person had no intention of ever playing it multiplayer.

Juego del mismo diseÃ±ador que el agricola o el le havre y se nota. 
Es un juego de colocaciÃ³n de trabajadores, con la novedad de que los recursos que ganas (que se pueden transformar en otros al estilo lehavre) los tienes que utilizar para "cubrir" un tablero personal. Tienes muchos puntos negativos y tienes que ir consiguiendo recursos para poder disponerlos en el tablero e ir tapando los puntos negativos. 
La colocaciÃ³n de trabajadores se realiza sobre un tablero de acciones que tiene unas cuarenta acciones diferentes, disponibles desde el principio, por lo que la primera partida puede resultar abrumadora. Hay cuatro columnas, y las acciones son mÃ¡s  poderosas cuanto mayor es el nÃºmero de columna.. pero te exige emplear mÃ¡s meeples.
En cada turno hay que dar de comer a los vikingos en un banquete.. aunque el tema de la comida se ha suavizado muchÃ­simo en comparaciÃ³n con otros juegos del autor.
AdemÃ¡s, incluye otros territorios, cobertizos, y tesoros para capturar haciendo pillaje.. que no lleguÃ© a utilizar en mi primera partida.
Es un juego muy abierto. Hay multitud de formas de puntuar y muchas estrategias posibles.. no tienes por quÃ© ir a todo.
Es un juego solo apto para jugones.

RATING: 10
*Another* Rosenberg masterpiece, solidifying his spot as my favorite designer. A Feast For Odin truly feels like a 'sandbox' game, with not only multiple paths to victory, but truly a wide-open array of options which can work well together. That is, it's not "you either go path a or path b", it's that you can pick and choose from a juicy array of choices each turn, and still pull off satisfying combinations that give an advantage. My one knock against Odin is that it doesn't have the engine building mechanic that Caverna, Le Havre, or Agricola have- but it makes up for it with an absolute deluge of strategic choices that still are manageable, and most of all, fun.

Edit: it does have engine building in how you produce way more goods later in the game than earlier. I also love the spatial, Tetris-y aspect of the tile placement. May now be my favorite Rosenberg and I'm bumping to a 10.

Prior to playing, was intimidated by what I heard in terms of complexity, but was pleasantly surprised by how well the game flows.  Yes, people take your spots, so you need a plan B and C like in Burgundy - I did 4 player.  I really enjoyed the pillaging and whaling.  Emigration seems like an easy path to a lot of points, and in our game tied for the win, but I can see where there are other ways to also get a lot of points.

This has the exact same feeling as Fields of Arle, but with an added spatial element of some tile laying. Since I like Fields of Arle, I like this too. The problem is that they come across as virtually the same game.

I have been saying for a few years now that I would really like to see Uwe Rosenberg come up with some fresh ideas. His games have became so samey samey that they just feel completely derivative of his own past designs. The massive amount of action choices started with Agricola which morphed to even more action spaces with Le Havre which he put on steroids to come up with Ora et Labora and then Caverna. I suppose with this new rendition, at least we are spared the collecting of a bazillion eeples of resources.

There's just so much in this game. I like it, and I did manage to form a semblance of strategy in my first play, but I can't say whether my strategy was good enough or whether with a few different moves I would have scored 10, 20, 30 more points. I'll try it a few more times and might up it to 9, but for now it's a solid 8.

Having also played it with the short version, I'm starting to like the game more. There's a greater need to plan ahead, and after these plays it seems more obvious what to do at least once you're a couple of turns in and have decided on a strategy. Then it's about the tactics of going for the actions we all want first, and in which order, since missing on one or two of those actions would cause huge problems down the road.

I was finally able to play this beast and I definitely appreciate it, but I think overall I find it to be too heavy compared to Agricola or Caverna. It's less punishing than Agricola and more open than Caverna, but it's probably too open and as a result, it's kind of overwhelming. I would like to play it some more once I have a better grasp on how it works, but even so I doubt it'd be a game I'd want to get to the table that often.

Although the game seems hopelessly overwhelming at first it's actually pretty simple at its heart: convert goods to other goods and use them to fill up your tableau. Few games have such a wide-open decision space: it feels like you can do anything on your turn, and the end result is a totally engrossing, thoroughly entertaining game.

Normally I hate "rolling for resources" a la Stone age, but here it doesn't bother me because 1) you get rerolls 2) you can mitigate your roll with weapons, and 3) you get a bonus if you fail. I also normally hate both having to feed your people, as well as punishing mechanics for failing to achieve something by end game (such as filling up your board), but these are fairly easy to accomplish in this game, so it's not a big deal: It's more interesting to "push your luck" with a territory board to score even bigger, at the risk of losing points on your main board.

A steep learning curve, but pretty rewarding once you internalize all of what's possible. Actually ended up being less intimidating than I thought it would be with all those action spaces, since often times,you'll know what you want to do and just have to find the action space that allows you to do that thing, which gets easier as you go.

You really get a feel of progression and accomplishment in the game, as you start off slow, and build up to really getting a lot accomplished. Similar to Agricola in that way, where it feels like you'll never get things done, and then by the end of the game you're humming along.  It's also very cool that players can take their own paths, pursuing different viable strategies.

I had kind of stopped paying attention to Uwe Rosenberg games as they all seemed to be derivative of each other in recent years, but A Feast for Odin feels much more unique, despite also having much in common with his other designs. Really fun stuff!

RATING: 7
Based on 1 play with 4 players:

I'm not sure what I can meaningfully say about this game - at this point, I think we all know that Rosenberg can be relied on to churn out solid, intricately crafted games with a paralyzing amount of breadth & depth. I admit the Tetris minigame was a surprise, but after Patchwork I suppose it shouldn't have been.

I will say that despite being no more complex than Agricola (even though it probably has even more possible strategies), it is harder to learn. Agricola has one thing going for it: everything makes sense thematically. Sure, cooking bread is an elaborate process - but it's easier to grasp and remember thanks to some real-world understanding of breadmaking. A Feast for Odin is more abstracted (especially thanks to the Tetris board), inching the learning curve upward ever so slightly.

That said, our time actually spent playing the game was remarkably close to the quoted 30 min per player even on our first game (short game) - a feat in itself.

Awesome. Likely my best game of 2016.
It takes the good parts of Rosenberg (action selection, occupation, number of different actions), takes out the parts we didn't like (harsh penalty mechanism, requirement to do everything without being free to chose your path), and adds a interesting puzzle aspect we already liked in Patchwork.
Highly recommended!

I figured this game was too heavy for me and it definitely is. I enjoy resource conversion games, but for me this is too many resources. Combine that with too many options and paths to pursue that lead to suboptimal play and frustration in finding a strategy. Between the dice rolls not going my way and cards not comboing well together I felt behind from the second round and really struggled to find a way forward to be productive. I ended up with over 30 negative points from my board alone. Maybe that is the benefit of the longer game, but man this game is complete overkill for me. I'd consider trying it again if someone suggested, but certainly not one I would ever suggest.

Uwe's fans will be pleased. Here's another big chewy resource converter that is, thankfully, tighter than Caverna with some interesting new bits. I especially liked the "worker curve" and the way that the player boards were able to visually map out almost all of the game (hooray for easy post-game analysis!). However, as with other Uwe games of this weight, I got the feeling that this was very much a "throw it all in" style game that could have used some serious mechanical trimming. I think he's best when he stays focused (Patchwork, Le Harve, Agricola).

A Feast for Odin is a resource conversion, tile laying game that takes the model to the extreme. The centerpiece of the game is the ingenious patchwork-like spatial puzzle, that has been successfully augmented with resource collection and negative points spaces, as well as a adjacency limitations. This is a clean piece of design of the highest order. The rest of the game is a lot like previous Rosenberg games, from Agricola to Fields of Arle, so if you played any of those you know what to expect. The numerous actions are well integrated and mostly thematic, and there are side boards to expand upon, giving you many options to explore. Lastly, the occupation cards from Agricola are there, giving you a nudge in a certain direction, but for some reason they feel less interesting than in Agricola. Perhaps it is due to the large number of actions, making them feel insignificant (but they are really not). One needs to plan carefully for the most expensive actions, which bumps up a notch the game in difficulty. Overall, a great game, but from my perspective a lesser game than Agricola. Recommended.

+ the patchwork mechanism is ingenious
+ highly thematic
+ lovely components, art and richness of material
+ works equally well at all player counts
+ great graphics design, helps the game learning immensely
+ the rulebook is exceptional, all our questions were answered clearly

= quite complex to play well
= takes a very long time to explain, and at least one training throwaway game

It's incredible how many thing you can do in "a feast for odin". You try to manage your group of vikings, doing whatever they did in real life (ex. Fishing, hunting, exploring, melting etc). The main board has more than 60 differnt actions and the mechanics that allows you to chose from them, it's really interesting. Every space on the board has a different requirement. To use the actions of the first column you need to spend a single viking of your color on it. As before, the second column need 2 vikings as the third one need 3 and the fourrh need 4. That machanics it's so strong in its strategy of worker placement and gives you many different way to use your vikings on the main board. It's a box full of components, starting from more than 400 "goods token", to many tiles for the players who wan to live a game about exploring the isle that vikings discover in the past time. But you need to be careful! It's not easy to get into the strategy mechanism! You have so many thing to do and in your first play it is possible that you finish it with a negative result! Why? Beacause in the first gameplay you probably want to try different way to increase your victory point as much as you can, but it's the best to don't get them. On the other hand, next you will notice that paying attention to a single or double way, gives you more strenght in some phase, like passing your time exploring the sea like a viking! Yeah, so much to do, but you have to chose carefully to don't get stuck in your own strategy! My advice is to experiment as much as you can from the first gameplay and stay focus on how the game put your back against a wall. Than you can elaborate your own strategy, but until then, enjoy the game as well as you want to. Really funny!

Might give it a 9 if it weren't such a beast to setup/cleanup. Best Rosenberg since Le Havre. Not sure if the excessive Tetris-ing will do it for everyone, but it works for me. I really like this more than Caverna because the array of buildings in Caverna that were available for picking was just too much. And the array of standard spaces was too small. Here, there is a generous array of places to send your workers, and it's fixed for the whole game. Although the bazillion occupation cards do provide some augmented actions for the player who plays them. There are a couple dice elements to the game, and some Rosenberg purists may bristle at this, but it didn't bother me too much.

In 2008 the game [i]Stone Age[/i] was released. It was (and still is) a family-oriented worker placement game, featuring clean mechanisms, a (fair) bit of randomness in dice, cards, and huts, and attractive artwork. It can be easily explained to newcomers, and is over and done with in about an hour. It is a simple game asking simple questions of the players, and is good at doing what it does. Forward to 2016 when the general public's favourite designer Uwe Rosenberg releases this game (abbreviated 'AFfO'). It proves to be a stellar hit yet again, comfortably entering the top-100 within a few months of its release with plenty of headroom remaining. Worker placement as a mechanism has had plenty of time to evolve to a form where it asks more of the players, right? But the sad, chilling, and in some ways downright unbelievable reality is that the worker placement core of AFfO asks [i]less[/i] of the players then does venerable Stone Age: actions, once taken, are blocked, and growth of the work force is automatic rather than by choice. How is it possible that such a game is not laughed away from any table it appears on?

It doesn't stop there, unfortunately. In what surely must be an attempt to appease the masses who insist on confusing 'complexity' and 'lots of stuff to do' with 'depth', a monstrous set of actions and materials has been created and packaged up in the big box. Granted, the actions are grouped in categories so that in terms of uniqueness the number. Isn't. That. Big. But still the implications of choosing one over the other must be taken into account, so you're still looking at a big amount. It's not helping that this board is rather cramped with small lettering, and that my somewhat elderly eyes are beginning to complain about this sort of thing. And the materials are just there to collect a shitload of... which are subsequently used to cover little squares on numerous private grids according to a few simple rules. Their biggest job is to cover a gazillion '-1 VP' squares so that your end-of-game point malus isn't that big. That is mostly all they do. There's a fair bit of conversion between materials in order to make them literally bigger so they cover more spaces. In a few rare cases you get a bonus for a bit of inefficient positioning, and if you're a good boy you can increase your income that way too... but covering squares, that's the core of the game. Why? Beats me, to be honest. But if [i]Let's see what silly nonsense I can unleash on the players while still letting me get away with it![/i] isn't somewhere on that list, I'm going to be very disappointed. 

The funny thing is that AFfO seems to be an amalgam of all kinds of earlier games by the same author. The square covering puts me in mind of Glass Road.  (And perhaps Patchwork too, but at the time of writing I haven't played that yet.) There's a big deck of unique cards reminiscent of Agricola... but the difference here is that you draw these at random during the game instead of at the beginning. The action board reminds me of Caverna's equally sprawling action and building boards. There's animals which breed themselves which is something we've seen before too. The need to do as well as you can because there is little hindrance is very Loyang-like. And so forth. It makes AFfO feel like Rosenberg's re-imagining of Friese's Copycat, but then using his own titles as inspiration. But the sad thing is that all these games [i]do better[/i] in whatever it is they want to accomplish using less materials in less time giving rise to a greater challenge. 

So why a 2? Well, apart from the lavish execution the ideas in contained in this box really are on par with the average Kickstarter title: simplistic, rehashed, underdeveloped, uninteresting. That would earn the title a 3 at best. But there's a malus of -1âpun intended, hahaâfor actually revelling in this middling stuff by adding a metric tonne of stuff onto a small set of core mechanisms which don't really support the weight. The author can do, has done in fact, a lot better in the past. I seriously hope that the next time he insists on jumping the shark a publisher will quietly take him aside and explain to him that this is not a good career move, especially since there is no need whatsoever for shark jumping as his games will get published almost automatically.

Played once at a convention.  The number of options that are presented to the player from the start of this game make it very hard to get started, but after playing it a while it becomes a lot easier on figuring out the strategy.  The one element of this Agricola-LeHavre variant that I really liked was the Tetris building you are doing on the player boards and the expansion islands.  Also, some players may not like the dice element in the game, but this didn't bother me to much.  Otherwise, this game has many of the mechanics that you know/love with feeding, buying ships, and propagating livestock.  A fun game hard to get new players into and not the gateway due to all those choices.

First the good. Lot's of space to explore, levers to pull, synergy to exploit etc. For many people that's an instant win. The tradeoff between loss avoidance and just gunning for quick and easy points is genuinely interesting.

It is a solitary puzzle though, which isn't my favourite kind of game. Nevertheless, when I want to play a game like that (which is frequent as not all of my friends like conflict as much as I do), this is at the top of the list. I am slightly worried that the strategies may be baked in, but time will tell.

No. looks like the same crap this guy phones in. Since the bean game he hasn't had much original thought. Reminds me of Moon milking that Ticket to Ride.

 Z-Man, isn't that another price controlled company now, aka an Asmodee distribution, at some point Congress needs to look into this almost "Movie Studio System" they seem to want, and the government busted up.  No fan of locking out all but 1-2 big online sites, who have walk in store fronts , setting high prices, making it harder for others online sites to stay in business, and you claim it's for support of LGS.

If you believe that no online retailer with a storefront would be included in your distribution. Give say CSI which has a huge presence  in the retail world, offering that free ship at $100 a. If advatage, it will hurt say Noble Knights Games that was cut off. 

This is just greed, what Asmodee is really doing is squeezing out competition in the online world, I would argue there is more overhead in online retailing, dealing with sales, web upkeep, returns, damage products. You have building, lights, heat cost. Around here the local comic book shop, or sports card shop that sells board games, it's a buy it, get out, the only extra overhead to them  is someone ringing you up. I sure they don't get long phone calls, email, lost packages to deal with, returns.

So, no, the game looks to be another rethemed tired rehash, no to unfair business models, no to Asmodee.

If Asmodee wants local club houses for their crap collecabke card crap, let the, build, own, operate their own stores, like Apple.

This feels like a sandbox game. Unlike Agricola, you don't feel punished by the game for a making a wrong move. It just won't give you as many points as the better move. There isn't a lot of blocking in this worker placement game, although opponents can still ruin your plans, or at least delay you a turn.

I even like the random die roll involved in whaling and raiding. It feels thematic. Whereas Agricola feels like you're building one engine (a food engine) in the game, A Feast for Odin makes you build towards a bunch of smaller engines (that can feed into each other) for specific types of tiles so you can fill up your boards. There's also some push-your-luck elements, where you really should go for that island even if you don't think you can fill it up (because it feels bad to get to the last turn and you have a bunch of goods tiles that are just wasted and not getting you points).

Very enjoyable, not stressful, and surprisingly easy to learn. Figuring out how to score big...that is much more difficult.

Wow, I've enjoyed this so far. Appears to be yet more of the same Uwe stuff, but this game has a different feel to it than Caverna or Arle. The puzzle mechanism, which at first seemed a dopey and unthematic addition, simply works and makes the game. I'm finding my inability to win very frustrating, but in a way that makes me want to play more to figure out what I'm doing wrong. Aggressiveness seems to be the key...very appropriate in a Viking game. My few solo plays have been very enjoyable as well.

Rosenberg has built an entire game around the board-filling elements of Caverna and Agricola. Essentially, the strategy is to avoid negative points by covering as much of your home board/houses/islands as possible. Animal pasturing and husbandry, as well as family expansion and feeding, play only vestigial roles in this game and require little attention. I suspect that most fans of the earlier games still will prefer those games to this one, although tetris lovers may enjoy the challenge of filling in the boards.

[2016-11-21 - First Impression]
I was and still am not so sure what to think about A Feast For Odin (AFFO). Before Essen, I wanted to skip this Rosenberg release since it seems as if there is just too much of anything in this game. Too many options, too many things to keep track of, just so much to consider without any clear guidance. After playing the game two times now (one solo and one two player game), I don't regret buying it. Both times I had a lot of fun managing my viking tribe.

I'm still not sure how to be good at it, but I guess I begin to see a little clearer. The player boards seem to be a distraction, giving you some points when filled up, but not nearly enough to be in the running for the win. In my one two player game, my opponent didn't get any resources from his player board, only covering up the negative points at the end. Everything else came from two islands. Still, he managed to get 99 points. There seems to be a need to find some other ways to generate points, like settling other islands and possibly other ways I haven't discovered yet.

I'm really looking forward to getting better at AFFO, I do enjoy the puzzle and for me, it's fun to discover new things. But while I do enjoy the opaqueness of the design, it might also be it's biggest drawback when it comes to my gaming group. The first play was very multiplayer solitaire, something I really don't mind but that doesn't fit well with most of my gaming buddies. I guess after getting to know the game a lot better, there will be competition and blocking once you know what the other players are trying to achieve. But in order to get to this point, you need some plays just to see what is possible in this game and I fear I won't be able to convince my friends to play this game that often. Which is just a shame, as I would rate it 8 or 9 right now.

[2017-01-27 Rating: n.a. -> 9]
After playing this some more, I've come to the conclusion that AFFO deserves a 9 from me. While I'm still not good at it, I have enjoyed every single play of this game. I've seen quite a few different strategies win (some even using only the main player board) and in games with three or more players, there's quite some room for (un)intentional blocking. In short: I really like this efficiency puzzle.

Got some friends, a big ol' table, half a day to kill, and a burning desire to place workers in all sorts of interesting ways? This is the game to reach for.

this should be called a feast for euro gamers. it is really tricky to figure out when to go for big actions that take away alot of your vikings or when you have a good engine to take that extra board. there are plenty of interesting and difficult decisions. It would be a 10 if the occupation card weren't mostly useless to you since they don't fit your specific strategy and there are hundreds of them. but they can help you make decisions because they guide you in a direction.

Good game but I actually think it's too friendly and not enough competing for spaces and actions. A friendlier version of Caverna/Agricola so to say. If you prefer a less cut-throat game that is good, but I think it became too much a solitaire game as you didn't really have to bother about what the other players did.

The game is very well done and everything fits nicely together. Easy to teach and easy to play (even if it's hard to play well :)). The tetris mini-theme is cool as well as you try to fill out your different boards.

Much better second time, might be an 8 after all?

Impression after first play is that this is the Rosenberg game I have been waiting for!  It is an evolution of his designs since Agricola, but takes a further leap with the grid-based goods system and puzzle-based scoring.

In many ways this game has the burden of living in the shadow of its elder brothers Agricola and Caverna.  Taken out of that shadow and judged as a game on its own, Feast for Odin is an excellent game.  Unfortunately, I donât feel it outdoes those other games and I still prefer Caverna and Le Havre above Feast for Odin.  

Agricola, Le Havre and Caverna all provide a feeling that you are growing something larger and leaves you with a satisfied feeling once the game is finished.  In Feast for Odin, you start out in-the-hole with all these negative points in front of you that you need to climb out from.  I didnât get the feel as much that I was growing things from the ground up, but rather just trying to get myself out of a hole.  

Iâm also not a fan of the Tetris-style tile laying.  Thematically it makes no sense and is actually not that challenging since you can just use money to fill empty holes.  It feels like it was added on for no reason.  

Unlike Agricola or Caverna, basically ALL of the worker placement positions are open right from the start which is immensely overwhelming for new players and therefore I feel like this game has a higher barrier to entry/learning curve than Agricola or Caverna.   

However, as a 2016 game pulled out of the shadows of Agricola, Caverna and Le Havre, I still enjoyed the game a lot and I can see a lot of depth and many potential strategies in this sandbox-style game.  I like the âgamblingâ aspect of some of the worker-placement positions as it can potentially add unexpected excitement to the game.  Or you can chose to ignore them and go a more straightforward route.  I also like the potential to add island-mats or villages and go that route.   
While Iâd rather play Le Havre or Caverna over this game, I still very much enjoyed Feast for Odin and look forward to playing more of it.

Uwe Rosenberg keeps making these wonderful Worker Placement games. From those first constraints and stresses of the Agricola model he has since loosened up and given the players more freedoms to explore the amazing gaming landscapes he manages to keep creating.

This is definitely in the Fields of Arle vein where from turn one 62 options are available to each player. Finding that you cannot do what you want to do is rarely a problem as the options are so vast, and anyway there are 'imitation' spaces to allow you to copy the space you want which an opponent takes. And so the game has a very multi-player solitaire feel to it. That is not a criticism in my book as multi-player solitaire allows each player to work their game through without the fear that someone else is going to destroy your game plans.

The spatial element added to the game with the tetris-pattern fitting is a really interesting puzzle too, but one which may not appeal so much to those who donât enjoy these geometric spatial planning games.

My only criticism is the size of the shared game board which, with its 62 action spaces, is simply not big enough for four people to view easily. It should have been double the size and folded again like a standard large game board in a bookshelf box.

Depending on where you sit on the Caverna/Agricola axis will indicate how much you are likely to enjoy this game. If you sit a long way toward the Agricola constrained gameplay side of that equation then you may not care for the open sandbox that is A Feast for Odin. But if you enjoy the freer game that is Caverna then I would say this would be something you would enjoy a lot.

Table devourer. It is amazing and intricate and a completely sand box game of efficiency and puzzle assembly in Tetris-like style through worker placement. Interaction is minimal. I usually don't like the infamous term "multiplayer solitaire" but this is exactly it. And I love it for what it is. Theme is also present, it is definitely not pasted up. A time/space consumer worth having.

Fun sandbox game. Takes a while to get a clear image of available options, but when you do it plays pretty smoothly. Player interaction is pretty minimal, in that way it's similar to Castles of Burgundy. One of my favorite worker placement games currently.

Oh man!  So many parts work wonderfully here.  I have minor complaints about hunting/raiding actions and card drafting.  None of these kill my pleasure though.  An overwhelming game for look at.  Learning is the easy part, mastering...let's just say I'm still trying.

Another typical Uwe game. Players try to fill up their boards to score points. There's lots of choices  and it takes too long for my taste. Pathchwork takes a lot less time.
It is a solid game in which you always can do something, but it's 3 hours of rather solitary optimizing your own board.

Feast for Odin is the biggest big-box Uwe worker placement euro. It's so big and includes so many components, the game comes with two trays for sorting some of the goods that come with the game. This game's claim to fame is being a hybrid of Patchwork tetris spatial optimization and the farming worker placement euro we've come to expect from Uwe. This game has a number of things I like and dislike about it. Let's start with the negatives:

-The occupation cards are very random. Sometimes you pull a good one that accentuates your strategy, sometimes they are useless. People have been trying to figure out a good variant for these.

-The game takes up too much table space. Playing with 2 is manageable, but if I was going to play a 2-player heavy euro, I'd rather play Fields of Arle. Three players would be challenging to fit on the table that I have and with 3, I'd rather play Ora et Labora. I can't play this game with 4 due to the table space it takes up and I think many would find it challenging. This is the main reason I don't see myself keeping Feast for Odin.

-I was *very* disappointed that most of the pieces you're placing on your personal board are various sized squares and rectangles. I wish more of the pieces were like the grey-ish pieces that more closely resemble the polyominoes in Patchwork.

There are many things that I like in Feast for Odin:

-Equal and escalating workers for each player.

-A large number of worker placement spots and some requiring multiple workers. It's very well organized as well.

-I like the injection of the dice rolling and push your luck elements. If you fail, you're still reasonably compensated. Very occasionally, you'd rather fail than succeed.

-Despite the cards being random (and listed in the negative section), I prefer them being in the game than not. There is also a huge variety of cards included, which is great.

-Another Uwe game featuring my home province of Newfoundland. It even has Labrador as well!

-The feeding requirements aren't overly harsh compared to games like Agricola.

I feel soul-crushed that this game doesn't really fit in my collection. It's also sad that I would probably rather play a a game of Patchwork with it's weird and wonderful shapes and another euro in the time that it takes to play this.

The added spatial element really adds another engaging solitaire element to this genre of game, for which I am a huge fan. Game looks fantastic and is highly engaging. Like many of the games in Uwe's toolbox, they have variable paths to victory and the added profession cards help to make the paths feel fresh.

RATING: 8
A Feast for Odin fuses the large action board and sandbox nature of Fields of Arle, with the spacial puzzle of Patchwork. The result is an incredibly fun game, with enormous breadth and several paths to journey. The action board is packed with options, making the game accessible though unusually open for a Rosenberg game. The resulting decision space is so wide it becomes impractical to assess each space, which facilitates a more casual atmosphere than expected. As in most Uwe games, players are gifted with a beautiful narrative arc, and can look down at their boards, islands, and buildings with a grand sense of accomplishment. A Feast for Odin is astonishingly fun, and despite being yet another Rosenberg evolution, delivers on multiple levels.

Very fun game that seems to have too many options until you can wrap your head around what exactly you are doing in the game and then it becomes much easier to make decisions. The puzzle element of fitting every piece on your board in an optimal manner is a great twist to the standard Rosenberg worker placement model. The dice element can sometimes be a little frustrating to those that are used to the perfect information action selection of other worker placement games, however it does a great thematic job of simulating hunting/gathering and the dice mitigation elements fit perfectly to avoid the game being to luck driven. Overall a great game I am happy to get out anytime.

The more Iâm in this hobby, the more present to me how some euro games are essentially competitive solitaire vs others that are built on emergent play between players. Odin is definitely of the former ilk whereas I prefer the latter. But itâs good at what it does. You just need to make sure you want this kind of experience before you sit down. 

Itâs a [caution: analogy overload] Frankenstein creation on steroids drinking a Red Bull. Youâve got 60ish possible action choices with various goods (puzzle pieces) that need to be collected and a literal Tetris puzzle. A thrust of the game is upgrading your puzzle pieces such that they fit better onto your player boards (some can only go in certain places, some can only touch diagonally, etc.). Itâs a bear to teach/learn, but it plays remarkably smoother than I expected.

I quite like the way the 60ish action spaces work. Theyâre in categories (for ex, collect resources, buy boats, go hunting, etc.) so itâs not quite as overwhelming as it sounds. But the innovation is that you can place 1 to 4 of your workers and get a commensurate return. This ROI mechanism makes for some really interesting choices and, for me, is the highlight of the experience. Fitting the pieces onto the board, well, I never enjoyed Tetris but it was a good challenge.

There are some random elements here with dice and cards. The dice didnât bother me because they were a push-your-luck mechanism for going hunting/pillaging and you can over-prepare as insurance. The cards, however, are the weakest part of the game. There are some that fit ever so nicely with your efforts and others that donât. Out of 10 cards I found 2 worth playing. I could see them coloring the experience too much if one player had a fortuitous set as every little bit helps. 

There isnât a lot of interaction. Players will generally go their separate ways and fight over just a few of the action spots. The fun is being able to make your own figurative and literal puzzle come together better than theirs while occasionally beating someone to a key action space (usually later in the game). Fitting this altogether in oneâs head and on your player boards requires a good bit of deliberation. Figure on 1h15m per player, at least at first.

28/11/2016: Lowering this to a 7. Still a good game, but the randomness of the card draws is a little too much for me. An Occupation might be very useful or nearly useless depending from when it's drawn and by whom. I dunno.

A very good game. I'm always willing to play it and try more strategies. My only concern is about the cards: it seems that getting the right ones at the right moment is a matter of luck. It's not a major factor in the game, but it's a little annoying.

The historian in me LOVES the fact that this game covers many different facets of what vikings were all about. The pillaging and plundering was actually quite rare and only a very small part of their history. Farming, livestock, building towns, exploring, and especially trade all dominated their culture more. The only thing missing from this is a little more Norse and Christian religion. That would make this the complete viking history game.

I surprisingly enjoyed this game very much. Although there are a ton of choices, the player manage to get a good overview of them before you get half-way through the first game of it.

[b]50 plays in less than two months! Yeeeah, okay, so it is very, VERY good. This will be Top 20 in no time. Tied for Agricola as my top game. Best solo game I have ever played. I'm happy to play it 1p and 2p at this point, since more players adds more time.[b]

[thread=1658930]My MASSIVE review of A Feast for Odin[/thread]
https://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/1658930/odin-massive-massive-review-feast-odin-befits-such

[b]AFTER 50 PLAYS[/b] I can say that this is tied with Agricola as my favorite game ever. I still have room to increase my skill at this game. There are still sub-strategies, and combinations of strategies that I haven't tried yet. I'm still trying new approaches to which islands I get and how I fill them. My friends love it, my wife loves it, and I think it's the best solo game ever.


After 17 total plays, I rate this a 10, and I like it [i]better[/i] now than I did when I first started playing it. From a 10 to a stronger, mightier 10, if you will. The strategies are many and varied, and so many parts of the game play out differently from play to play (valuation of Exploration boards, puzzling on those boards).

After 3 plays of the solo game and one play of the 2p game, I'm on a rock-solid 10.[/b] It could possibly slide down to an 8 for me over time - it will really come down to how much the Occupation cards affect variability. But with such a massive variety of cards available, and only 3-7 cards in play per game, that shouldn't be a problem. And the game system is so good that I think this will have legs. (And expandable for days: you could release a mini deck of new Occupations, or a revised board that added new mechanics like battles, or even a large expansion that changed the setting to something like Native American/First nations or Inuit,)

Play 1: :star::star::star::star::star: 1p
Play 2: :star::star::star::star::star: "
Play 3: :star::star::star::star::star: " Realize this is best solo game ever.
Play 4: :star::star::star::star::star: 2p
Play 5: :star::star::star::star::star: 1p
....
Play 10: :star::star::star::star::star: Enjoy more now than at first play!
....
Play 15: :star::star::star::star::star: - Getting better puzzling
....
Play 50: :star::star::star::star::star: - This continues to be one of the best game experiences on the planet.

A resource conversion euro that steps out of the doldrums by giving players actual "puzzle" pieces to swap then place on boards. Tons of options, but not as sandboxy as you think if you play to your Occupation cards. On top of being great game design, the game is just fun: the Viking theme is good, the dice are surprisingly good, the options offered give you lots of ways to bend your strategy over the course of the game as you try and finish the game without waste, and prosperous in points.

SEP 2016 (before playing): I do have some concern about how open gameplay will be for 2p, but I think that the Occupation cards will make the game work for me. After all, there are times when I play 2p Agricola and my opponent and I don't get in each other's way too often. In those playings, it is scrambling to make my strategy work that makes the game exciting - Occupations in this game should provide that drive.

I liked this better than I thought I would as it is normally not my cup of tea.

I won, 100 to 76 in my first game.  We played the full/long game with all of the turns.  On the last turn I was able to finally get a boat, emigrate, and explore a new island, which, because of my income of 18 (all from my main board) and a few extra green/blue tiles, I was able to cover up all of the -1 spots and get the full 36 points for that island.

I really enjoyed the puzzle aspect of it, i.e. filling up your board, and figuring out which actions to take and then convert to other things to fill up my board.  I didn't take advantage of getting the bonuses as early as I should have, but i did wind up getting a bunch in later turns.

That's where my enjoyment of it ends.

This game falls into a few of my dislike categories:
- generic actions where you aren't actually doing anything, i.e. I'll spend 3 workers to emigrate, great you flip over a ship and now you've emigrated somewhere.  Where?  doesn't matter, but you did it.

- thin veneer of a theme.  Because of the generic actions, I don't feel like I'm actually doing the actions that I take.  Take upgrading for example.  I drop a few workers there and now my sheep has turned into a hide, and is now some treasure.  I didn't feel like I was doing whatever it is upgrading is suppose to be.

- tetris mechanic, while this was the part I actually liked, has nothing to do with Vikings.  You want to lay out your treasure?  Better make sure it it fits in this grid.

- nonsense placement rules.  Why can't i place green tiles next to each other, or red and yellow can't be next to each other?  Just to make you do an extra conversion?  Give me a thematic reason why it would make sense to not allow 2 rolls of wool be next too each other.

In the end, did I feel like I did these awesome things like building boats and exploring new islands, and emigrating there, and finding treasure?  No, I was taking generic actions to do resource conversion.

While a nice puzzle, and well designed, I don't think I felt like I was achieving something.  Rosenberg again proves that he can have a mechanically good design, that doesn't pull you in with any theme.

RATING: 5
A game that despite it's many components is quite easy to learn and understand. There is an abundance of choices and it easy to set a target for yourself and to achieve it.

However for me the game lacked focus. I am not a fan of sandbox games and this ones really feels like one to me. I wish there were a few things that would steer me a bit in certain directions. I like games that gave me 3 or 4 interesting choices every turn, this one gives me 61 mildly interesting choices.

I'm not a fan of Rosenberg's apparently rekindled love of sandboxes and vastly prefer his more competitive games. A Feast for Odin is the sandbox to make all other sandboxes pale, at least from a materialistic vantage point. There are dozens of action spaces with slightly different payoffs, producing countless different chits of varying colours and sizes, and a large board (with various extensions available) that players can put those same chits onto while heeding extensive placement restrictions, mostly to increase your income or reduce the size of your end game penalty.

All of that works, and in spite of the seeming resource overload the game actually plays surprisingly smoothly in practice, but the puzzling and scoring on the various boards is so trite, so disconnected from everything else that I just cannot get excited over it.

Uwe Rosenberg taucht weiter ein in seine eigene Idee von Tausch und Warenverkettung, die in ARLER ERDE ihr Herz gefunden hat. Und dem FEST FÃR ODIN gelingt es, den ostfriesischen Liebreiz nach Norden mitzunehmen. Ãberraschenderweise gibt sich das Wikingerspiel weniger monstrÃ¶s als es der XXL Teilebrocken mit integriertem PATCHWORK signalisiert, sondern zeigt sich in vielen kleinen Ideen schÃ¶n thematisch: man merkt, dass sich Uwe der Wikinger in das Thema vertieft hat und dabei seinen unverkennbaren Spielstil der Lebensart der Nordmannen von Walfang bis PlÃ¼nderung in Angelsachsen unterordnet. Wie schon in seinem Heimatspiel dient ein informatives Kultur-Begleitheft als Zeugnis der vorbildlichen Recherche in der Bibliothek von Emden. DAS FEST FÃR ODIN ist dem geneigten Spieler eine langlebige Entdeckungsreise und vielleicht das erste Wikinger-Placement-Spiel, das vom Alltag der Wikinger erzÃ¤hlt, so dass man vor lauter Spielen glatt wie Walbratfett das Siegen vergisst.

A very solid game.  This is Rosenberg's attempt at really throwing the kitchen sink into a game and allowing for more paths to victory than one could ever possibly pursue in one sitting.  Like 'Le Havre', A Feast for Odin is a game that immediately hits you as a sprawling mess of ideas and mechanics, components and cards.  And yet, it all somehow comes together and feels fully integrated and easy to understand as you get the first few turns underway.  AFfO might be his most challenging game yet, as Rosenberg could have really cut out parts of the game to make it more streamlined, and yet it is clear through every part of the game how conscious he was of not compromising on his vision.  If you like vikings and their history and mythology, this is a game where you can build, explore, pillage, plunder, hunt, whale, trade, forge, feast, employ, etc., etc., etc.  The list could honestly go on for another line or two.  Remember how ridiculous it was to consider the 15 or so goods available in Le Havre? Try 30 in Odin!  Three full decks of a variety of occupations as well!  So much variety.  It's ridiculous actually, and yet it might be your kind of ridiculous.

That all being said, I'm not sure if it gives me a greater feeling afterward than I get from a game that comes in a box half its size.  There is certainly a lot of interesting stuff going on in Odin, but at the end of the day it is a Euro through and through and there are enough parts of the game where you are doing the expected resource management and upgrades. The spatial puzzle (a la Patchwork) is at the heart of the game and there is really no way to consider any sort of tie to theme.  It is wholly an abstract, puzzle mechanic situated within a deep Euro.  As long as you are a fan of Euros and have "forgiven" enough games for not having mechanics match theme, then you will be right at home here.  The puzzle is so much a part of the game that you will be intrigued by how to play it out properly, but it's not a great hooplah of whizz-bag fun.  But it is deep, thinky fun - so again, this better be your type of fun if you're going to like this.  Also, it is very multiplayer solitaire with 2 players.  Surely there is a bit more unintentional blocking with 3 or 4 players, but with 60+ action spaces, people rarely get in your way.  And I don't think I would ever want to play this with 4 players unless everyone was very well-versed in the game.  3 is even pushing it.  This is probably best at 2 player for the next little while.

tl;dr: Rosenberg does again what he does best: he created another game that feels very much like his signature and yet feels nothing like anything he has done before.  He is an artist with a mark.

Basically this is like Fields of Arle and Patchwork combined.  With 61 action spaces to choose from there are a number of different paths you can take. I like the tetris-like aspect of the player and exploration boards, but overall I did not find the game to have much meat to it.

Whoa! This is incredible. It's a big old sandbox to play in and the first time you play it you'll be overwhelmed but the flow of the game is pretty easy to follow once you've played 1 game. Setup isn't too bad after you get used to where everything goes. There's a lot of pawn placement and if you play solo you'll be using 2 sets of pawns. There's a zillion things to do on the big board, and lots of neat ways to place your tiles on you home board or island you've explored. 

First game : overwhelming
Second game : discovered occupation card mistakes

Iâm glad to say that actually playing Odin has put most of my fears to rest. It is a terrific game, the theme has been brilliantly integrated and there are just so many different strategies waiting to be explored. It is not a very interactive game, especially with just two as the choice of actions is so broad. I love the tile placement mechanism, it may be completely abstract but still does a wonderful job of focusing the other thematic aspects of the game.

RATING: 10
This is rapidly becoming one of my absolute favorite card/board games along with Race for the Galaxy.

I've only played with 2 players and solo.  The 2-player mode has moderate interaction if your strategies overlap or you run into a choke point, and there are some unique and limited island boards players can fight to buy.  Other than that, it is low conflict which is a plus for my girlfriend and I.

The game can appear intimidating, and the rules can be a little hard to find things in (make sure to check the errata and PDF rules if there is a question).  Despite this, I am rating it a 10 due to the unique mechanics, enjoyable learning experience, and high replayability.  More than almost any other game I have played, you can FEEL yourself improving the more you experiment.  Once you get started, the mechanics make sense.

There are several paths which can be followed, and different paths are enhanced by various occupation cards which you draw throughout the game.  These cards make aspects of your game stronger or change a rule so you can pursue a particular combination.  There are so many occupations (45 starting, 145 additional) that the variability and replay value are massive.

Mechanics are varied as well.  There are some dice spaces which provide calculated risk with mitigation and enhancement modifiers, some combination spaces for traditional resource chains, and lots of Tetris-style tile layout puzzling to optimize your score.  You can decide between money gained over time, bonus tiles gained over time, or easier layout.

The solo experience is one of the best I have played.  I like the Automa systems in Viticulture and Scythe, but this game does something different from a normal card-based and/or space-blocking opponent -- in this game, you have no downtime and you block yourself.  Instead of managing a dummy player, you play with two colors.  Each round, you use the opposite colors and are blocked by your previous turn's choices.  This means that the spaces most likely to help you are potentially most likely to be blocked, and you cannot use the same strategy every turn.  The solo mode also has an unusually strong addictive quality for a board game.  After you finish, it tends to stick in your head or draw you back in because you keep thinking, "If only I had chosen that other resource and sold my boat later, I could have wasted less food and maybe added a few MORE points on."

Last but not least, this is a very thematic euro.  Aside from the tile placement mechanics, almost everything in the theme makes sense in the context of game mechanics, and it all works together in a really strong package.  There is even a massive almanac that talks about Viking terms and history.

Wow - just so much to go back to. So many strategies to try that all make sense and fit well together. Not super competitive but great as a solo and as good as multiplayer solitaire gets. Down to an 8 - too hard to get to the table and too much down time between turns. I like this game compared to other multiplayer solitaire games because of the duplicate action spaces. This makes it less likely to get screwed by someone who's not even looking at your board and just happen to take your space - I hate games where that's a problem (yokohama or something). For reference, in a game like Trickerion, there are less spaces and you know where everyone is going so you can plan to screw people or re adjust the optimal flow of your moves so you don't get screwed. In other words, I don't mind the screwage, as long as it's intentional!

RATING: 5
Uwe Rosenberg has designed some great games. A Feast for Odin, for me, is not one of them. This game is a good illustration of some of the trends that are moving "heavier" Euros in a less promising direction: more rules, more components, more mechanical processing, too many choices with too little riding on them, less scarcity of resources, less player interaction, and an emphasis on scripted strategies based on solving the "baked in" efficiency puzzles of the game rather than emergent strategies based on the behavior of the other players.

What we have here is an unremarkable resource-conversion worker-placement game grafted to a complicated version of FITS. I wouldn't call that a marriage made in heaven. The worker placement portion is so loose and friendly that you'll barely recognize the presence of other players in this game. The FITS (Tetris-like) portion is completely solitaire, requires careful heads-down planning, and has no intuitive thematic purpose. Why am I placing pelts and chests and baubles on my landscape to cover up -1's and enclose resource spaces? I don't always care about rich theming in games, but thematic integrity has always been central to Rosenberg's Agricola-related games.

I found A Feast for Odin to be among the least elegant games Iâve played in a long time. Itâs so convoluted. Iâm sure there is a good game in here somewhere, but with 64 worker placement spots and a crazy weird rule set with the scoring boards and how you collect income, Iâll leave it up to someone else to find out if thatâs true. This is the same designer who designed the impeccable Le Havre?

Plenty of interesting parts to root around for, it seems like. The spatial puzzle is a lot more interesting than arranging a farm in Agricola, maybe now I can even see what Rosenberg was getting at there... but there's still something fundamentally sour, for me, about the types of decision-making that Rosenberg's big games seem to focus on. Playing one is choosing to take a long vacation somewhere I don't like being.

Es un juego muy entretenido, con muchas opciones, muchas estrategias a seguir, con retos personales para conseguir llenar lso espacios y tratar de que todos lso recursos logren estar en algÃºn lugar, y a su vez compites con los demÃ¡s por los puestos, lo cual hace que haya interacciÃ³n indirecta que conforme se acerca el final del jeugo se vuelve mas latente.
Es un juego muy completo, con grandes detalles, las opciones, las cartas, los dados, los puntos, los espacios, y te hace romperte la cabeza llenando la cuadrÃ­cula pero a la vez cuando lo consigues  da una sensaciÃ³n de alivio que va mas a llÃ¡ a si ganaste o no el juego, y frustraciÃ³n si no lo consigues. La comida, sin ser un agobio como en otros juegos del autor, igual es una preocupaciÃ³n bÃ¡sica que te obliga a pensar en paralelo, lo cual es buenÃ­simo.
Es bastante largo eso sÃ­, hay mucho que pensar, calcular, medir, planificar, decidir, y eso hace que demore en su desarrollo, lÃ³gicamente con mas jugadores o con nuevos, eso serÃ¡ mas largo, pero en su beneficio, se da que ese tiempo largo se pasa volando, ni lo sientes, y no hay momento en el que te desconcentres a tu juego porque cuando otro juega uno igual estÃ¡ midiendo su siguiente jugada o armando su rompecabeza.
Es un gran juego, a mi parecer, con cosas distintas a las sensaciones que dan juegos anteriores del mismo autor, el peso y tamaÃ±o de la caja lo valen a mi parecer, y el que no tenga casi nada de texto hace que sea muy fÃ¡cil de acercar a jugadores. 
Recomendable sin duda, pero principalmente a jugadores que gustan de este estilo de euro de gestionar recursos, planificar cadenas, colocar trabajadores y sobre todo, armar rompecabezas.

After one play...

Very open game, like Caverna, and doesn't induce the angst I get when playing Agricola. I lost horribly (winner had 105p, I had 19!), but just want to try again. This game, I  feel, punish you the right way for playing badly, in that you have the same amount of workers as everyone else, but just lose point for playing sub-optimal. Basically the game doesn't punish you for not getting your snowball going, in that you will have less to do, which is a mechanic I truly hate!

On the negative side, it is quite a few small rules to keep in mind, but the rulebook is overall good (some minor issues) and and easy to dig through...

Update:
Second game I upped my score to 80. The first time players scored 3 and 40. The winner 99p. I think this game takes 2-3 games to get the hang of. It took us around 3 hours to finish the game both times I've played (4 Players), which is long in my book. Acceptable, but a tad bit too long (AP being the culprit)!

What to say about this beast? Really it deserves more effort than I have to give. For now, this list of thoughts will have to suffice.
Only for the most hardcore strategy gamers.
I kind of want to try single player mode.

Liked:
Spatial placement aspect
Feeling of digging out of a hole
Trade many resources for other resources
Dice mechanics with some opportunity to mitigate luck or avoid them all together
Comes with chit trays, a nice touch

Found lacking:
Worker placement (I'm sick of it)
Millions of cards... balanced? Who knows.
Exploration tiles do not initially seem like a good idea (taking on extra VP debt when the main board is already a challenge to fill)
The upgrade hierarchy is not printed anywhere on the board, that would have been useful information 
The three types of boat could be easier to tell apart

Compelling, engaging game with rich theme and not so complicated gameplay.

Edit: logged in my 20th game and first multiplayer (2 player)! Great experience. Lately I have come to like the buildings a lot! I also try to squeeze the most out of the cards I play. Playing around 3 and 4 Viking spaces is crucial. Endless possibilities and dice bring excitement (you cannot possibly math everything out and that's awesome). Plus, I love love love those spaces where a fail will get you some of your Viking troupes back, 

A favourite of mine.

Perhaps a bit too heavy to be played every night and on every occasion. Love the theme, about vikings but what it truly was, taking care of your own family and community, instead of always pointing the war-side of viking live. Surely on this game you can also plunder, marauder and pillage, but if you do only that, you will surely lose. This game is about viking-economics, you have to build your village, feed your family, breed your animals, harvest food from fields etc.

RATING: 8.4
Want to play this thing more!  There seems like there is so much depth here.

Giving you a board with 40+ spaces to place workers right out of the gate is a lot to deal with at first.  

This might be my new favorite Rosenberg game.  

However, there are some downsides to this game:
- Table Hog.  You will need a lot of space to play with 3 or 4 people.
- TONS of small pieces.  
- Lots of fidgety pieces.
- People could get AP

If you can get past those things it's a heavy Euro with cool mechanics and definitely worth the praise it's been getting.

A Feast for Odin is definitely great even at the higher player counts. It solves the problems of Caverna by giving players constant ways to fiddle and think when it's not their turn. Maxing at four, it also solves Caverna, which should have never allowed more than four.

Having played A Feast for Odin over the last year or so, I can say that I think it is incredible. At four players, it's the pinnacle of what Uwe set out for so many years ago, and it also plays amazingly well even down to the solo play count.

I'm not sure what negative I could say about the game. Over ten years in this hobby, I still don't seek games in the multiplayer solitaire genre. However, Feast is as good as it gets, and the interaction of action blocking is significant. I'd still put it in the genre, but nevertheless, it's superb.

Heavyweight - Uwe Rosenbergs heaviest?

The problem I have with this (as with so many of his other games) is that increased choices don't necessarily result in more challenging decisions, they just result in more to learn. I'd rather have VERY challenging decisions, in a more streamlined form.

That said I do like a lot of the ideas he's put in place here. The tetris style placement of tiles is nice, the rules about Green not touching Green is nice as it forces variety...

I just don't like the overall feel.

---

I gave this a try a few more times and it's kinda grown on me. There are still 2 things that frustrate me; I'd like there to be an extra row at the bottom of the board where you can sell/(and buy?) excess weapons and/or professions.  Without this you're at the mercy of just 1 draw per turn (yes I know there's an action for +4 cards but without the hand management elements then you're stuck).

Secondly I wish that there were more viable tactics - unfortunately despite the variety in options the same boring stuff always seems to win

This may be the point at which Rosenberg games tipped over from fascinatingly complex to ... this is excessive.  I'd like to try it again, but in my one play, it felt like I could really only attend to a little part of the game.  The variable worker placement (that is, the ability of players to choose how many workers they'll put on a space, meaning they can adjust the power of the action) is a pretty neat idea.  I didn't love the weird spatial graph thing. (1 play)

I think I'm growing tired of Uwe Rosenburg designing the same game over and over again with slight variations.  Feast for Odin feels like so many of Rosenburg's other games, it's just bigger and has more options.  The game boils down to getting goods and converting those goods up through a chain of more valuable versions.  This isn't a bad design by any means, but Rosenburg has done this so many times before.  This game's variation is the Tetris manner in which you fits the goods together on you board.

Really love this. Feels deep and rich, with quite a bit to explore and unpick, but at the same time I find it really relaxing to play. 

I find the theme more immersing than your typical Uwe game. Feels like I'm telling a story of my clan rather than just constructing an optimising vp machine. I think that's why I enjoy this solo as well as multi player (might also be why my scores are bad).

Downside is that the rules explanation can be a real pain.

Excellent explanation at Essen 2016, Nate sat with us and did most of the chit management. I liked the game, it's sort of a worker placement engine building Patchwork; you build an engine with which to generate puzzle pieces with which to cover the board. You only ever have two worker actions per turn and 7 turns, so important to use them wisely. Probably plays a hell of a lot better/faster if everyone is really familiar with all the action spaces, same as Caverna in that regard. I won't be buying it at full price but would love to play again if someone else did.

RATING: 6.5
Original impressions: 10/10 

A Feast for Odin tantalizingly overwhelms the player with choices and options. Immediately I was looking forward to the next game to explore the breadth of options available.

Impressions a couple plays in: 4/10

When fully explored AFfO failed to hold up repeatedly. Choices felt meaningless, no competition exists between players, and there's a general lack of feedback to your actions. By the end I didn't feel like I could look back and see how I could do better.

Final impressions: 6.5/10

It's hard for me to shake my feelings that the game is shallow. In execution AFfO is a game of limited opportunities with open information. Imagine playing a game of Hold 'Em with the entire deck on the table. One choice is perfect, a couple are helpful, and the vast majority completely worthless. AFfO then becomes a game of sifting out the worthless options.

AFfO deserves its accolades as a solo game. As a puzzle it succeeds. As a competitive game AFfO is completely uninteresting. You'll spend majority of your time fiddling with your board than pay attention to your opponent's.

I really can't think of anything bad about this. Set up time isn't bad, plays well solo and with others, so many options to explore and tinker with...just a great game. Eventually I will probably make a deck of starting occupations out of the ones from each deck that are better/more robust that the others, but still feel like I have a lot to explore before getting to that point.

RATING: 8.5
I have to admit that I wasn't really expecting to like this game. Most of Uwe's big box games I'm fairly lukewarm on, but this one really clicked. I do really enjoy the spatial puzzle element, and I think the twists of the income track and the bonus spots you need to surround are pretty much necessary to keep that part interesting.

But to me the main strength of the game is in how all of the various actions interact with each other. I think it's very important that there are a lot of ways to get and to upgrade the various colors and shapes of pieces. If you need a particular one there might be three or four different ways to get to it, or more likely if you're just staring down a set of tiles and trying to figure out the best way to make them bigger and better at covering boards, you have a number of options and figuring out which is the best isn't at all clear. Compare to something like Fields of Arle, where if you have say wool, you know making it into points means turning it into cloth and you know the one spot on the board that does that. In A Feast for Odin when you find a good path through the various overlapping action spots you feel clever, rather than just following the one path the game has provided.

As far as the rolling dice, it's honestly fairly minor and you have lots of ways of mitigating your luck to help control the outcome. I wouldn't necessarily say that I think the dice are necessary, but they don't detract for me at all. The cards on the other hand do feel a bit swingy. Some I feel like I'd basically never use, or I'd have to devote my whole strategy around, whereas others just see across the board helpful. But really the biggest problem with them is that they could combo off of each other if you happen to get ones with aligning goals, which is completely random.

This is a very good game with plenty of ways to score points and many paths to victory, a true point salad game. Though while I enjoy all of the aspects of it, I don't love anything in particular and it does have a patchwork sort of feeling to the entire presentation. 

That being said, I rate it highly and would gladly play it, however I probably won't be asking to play it or buying it.

This is a worker placement game with an interesting Tetris sort of mechanic.  Each turn you place your workers.  Only one player goes on each spot so there is the usual player maneuvering.  The choices are interesting and embody different strategies.  An interesting twist is that the options are arranged in four columns of increasing power and you need to put in a number of workers equal to the column so you have a trade-off between many low-power actions or a few high-power actions.  Aside from wood, stone, iron, and money, you can get various tiles of different sizes and colors.  Some of them are food that can feed your hungry vikings (it's easy to avoid falling short so no drama there).  The challenging part is using these tiles to fill in parts of your board to offset negative victory points and to gain an income of new tiles.  The tile placement has to follow various rules and their differing sizes and shapes makes for a spatial puzzle.  It's a very cerebral game so not tense but definitely engrossing as you try to figure out the best choices.  There are also occupation cards that provide various small but useful bonuses that help mix up the strategies and provides asymmetry.  Unusually for a Euro of this type, there is a luck element of rolling dice but it's sufficiently buffered that I don't think luck plays a significant part.  There are a lot of moving parts in this so I think there is good replay potential.

This is a fantastic game. A joy to play with the full complement of players and quite good solo as well. Endless amount of options which allows you to change your strategy on the fly once someone gets in your way. It is quite intimidating with so many negative points staring at you but you need to overcome that fear and take the challenge of exploring a new island or filling your home board as you go.

Uwe Rosenberg is one of my favorite game designers. I have bought and liked every one of his heavy games, Iâm not much of a fan of his lighter games, but as I knew A Feast for Odin wasnât a light game, I was pretty sure I was going to like it, and I did :D.

The rules of the game arenât as complex as I was expecting from what I have heard, however, there are many rules so explaining takes around 25 minutes. Playtime is around 3 hours.

The gameÂ´s components are very well done and you get a lot of components. Unpunching the game takes a lot of time.

The theme is ok I guess, but I donât feel it through the game except when I have to feed my people.

I have heard, the game had lots of decisions each turn, and thatâs true, but they arenât as hard as I thought they would be. The choices are grouped by categories, so if you send more people to do an action, the reward will be bigger, but in the same category, that is, if you want food, you can send one worker and obtain an small reward or you can send a lot of workers for a bigger reward. DonÂ´t get me wrong, A Feast for Odin has very interesting decisions, you can do a plethora of actions each turn. Some of the actions require one worker and some require four workers, so deciding where to send your workers isnât obvious. There are spaces to get food, to hunt, to attack, to gather resources, to explore.

There is a lot of luck of the draw with the cards, Iâm not sure if this can be mitigated. Sometimes you get some amazing combos going on, other times, the cards donât have any synergy between them. The is also luck with the dice when you hunt and when you attack. This luck is much more controllable as you can use weapons and boats to increase/decrease your roll, you also get 3 throws with every action. Even if you fail your roll, you get a reward. I need more plays to see if the luck factor is an issue for me.

In A Feast for Odin has, you have to feed your workers as is traditional from Uwe Rosenberg. Each turn you have to feed more and more workers (unless you have sent them away) and the method of feeding is very interesting. The best way to do it is using different food to maximize its effect. When you begin the game, you have lots of negative VPs, so looking for the best way to counter them is very fun. The way to counter them is to cover them and here is an spatial aspect to the game, similar to Patchwork and I enjoyed it. 

Best with 3 players.

The game isnât as cutthroat as Agricola, there are many repeat spaces, so blocking someone isnât worth it, this makes the tension of the game a lot less than AgricolaÂ´s.  A Feast for Odin is a much friendlier game, I think this is a negative for me.

A Feast for Odin is an expensive game, but you get so many content for the game, you feel the price is fair.

I expect the replayability factor to be high with all the cards. I need more plays to verify this point.

Bottom line, A Feast for Odin is a good game and I like it a lot. It offers interesting decisions and it seems it has multiple paths to victory. It is definitively a keeper for me and I want to explore it further. At first it seems very complex and scary, but it is much simpler than I thought it would be.

I should enjoy Feast for Odin more than I do, I suppose.  I own Agricola, Le Havre, Ora & Labora, Caverna, and Fields of Arle.  I rate the first three games 10.  This title has the worker placement, resource management and strategic depth that made those games such hits for me, and it does those aspects well.  The spatial puzzling is an interesting new addition.

Where I struggle with Feast for Odin is the very large decision space on the action board.  Mentally, sifting through the 60+ actions are very fiddly to me even though a strategic focus can narrow them down to a few useful ones at a time.

I'd like to play a few more times to see if the clutter clears with more experience.  On the other hand, maybe it's just that I'm just not as young and sharp as I was when I first played Agricola.

Just one solitaire play so far, but this one is great I think. The puzzle aspect is really fun, especially trying to work around the bonus spots. The dice rolling actually does not bother me (so far), and it seems very fitting for the theme. I also really like the occupations system where drawing/playing them is a side effect of other actions. I look forward to playing this one more both solo and multi-player.

Having played one 2-player game and several solo games, I really think I might enjoy this game more as a solo experience. It is an amazingly challenging puzzle with a bit of luck thanks to the dice and cards (not too much luck though - just enough to keep it interesting). I think I will break out the B-deck soon.

Sold this since I prefer Fields of Arle. Both are excellent, but Fields of Arle is truly a masterpiece, and I really only need one huge Uwe game.

A Feast for Odin most immediately resembles Fields of Arle with the huge menu of actions to select from every turn. Rather than using action drafting (worker placement) to deny other players certain avenues, this style of action drafting is more about optimizing your plan. If someone blocks the action you want, there is probably a similar, albiet less optimal action available. The action board is divided into four columns of increasing strength, with each further column requiring an additional worker to activate (so from 1-4 workers for each action). Players start with 5 workers and gain one additional for each of the 7 turns of the game. Balancing your action choices with your available worker pool is a strength of the game.

For the most part, players are trying to acquire or upgrade tiles of sizes from 2-12 squares in 4 hierarchical colors. Player boards have a grid where tiles can be placed - according to placement restrictions - to increase income, provide bonus resources, and to cover up the negative point squares that loom over your endgame scoring. Players can acquire buildings and explore islands that provide additional grids that need to get covered to accomplish more of the same things. Feeding requirements are also met with tiles and getting the right colors and sizes to meet the patterns of your player boards is the heart and soul of the game. There are resources and money that you need to acquire in order to complete some of the more powerful actions, but most everything is eventually put to the service of tile acquisition.

The game looks complex, but one you realize the singular focus of what you want to accomplish, the game logically falls into place. It is, however, this singular focus that makes me hesitate to put this title in the upper tier of Uwe's canon. I miss the thoughtful interaction of the specific buildings which you've chosen to build and leverage, which is a prominent feature of Uwe's classic big box designs. Here, when you a acquire a tile, it is to be thoughtfully placed on your player boards, but then has no further use. I don't mind the broad array of actions and I enjoy the polyomino puzzles of the player boards, but there really is no engine-building to speak of and I missed that. This is still a very good game that I enjoy and I'm going to hold onto it, but it just isn't my favorite.

I am not a fan of many of Uwe's resource conversion games, however, I liked this one quite a bit more. The conversion aspect is different here since the tiles are primarily used to cover spaces on various boards adding a unique spatial element. I found this style of resource conversion easier to understand and more interesting in how it affects the other aspects of the game. 

There are many different actions and several strategies. The sheer number of action spaces is a lot to take in at first. It also means that there isn't a huge amount of blocking. Blocking does happen, but the size of the board coupled with the contrarian nature of things means that people don't step onto each others toes all the time. You also do have some sense of what other players want to do. 

I think the turn order rules are a bit awkward. If you are sitting to the left of the person who happens to go first you get an advantage for no reason. Even the way start player is determined seems a bit arbitrary. The game also ends in a litany of scoring categories typical of a large Uwe game. I don't like how obfuscated people's scores are during the game.

Overall I liked it. I want to play again.

My first Uwe Rosenburg game so I can't compare it to the others. I am enjoying this game so much that I can't wait to play again and I am finding that each additional play increases my enjoyment. This is a game that takes a few plays to get the most out of it, placing stuff on the boards is a mini game by itself ( it was designing this game that gave birth to Patchwork). Your turn is nearly all about combos getting a resource to use elsewhere to make something else to upgrade and put on your player boards.
  The board does seem overwhelming and open to start with but the things you want for your strategy soon narrow down and I have blocked myself in the solo game. The price tag is a little high but you do get a lot of game for your money.
  Watch a few playthroughs before you buy but I don't think you will be disappointed I have found it to be an exceptional game I will keep coming back to.

The biggest boardgame puzzle published. How do I fill up my board(s) most efficiently? Do I raise cattle, harvest or craft? Or is expressing some viking violence by pillaging or whaling more up to my taste? Beside the more than 30 worker spots, replayability comes from the almost 200 unique building cards. The cards are not as crucial as in Agricola but using them more efficiently can provide the decisive efficiency boost.

Sometimes, a spot will be blocked but usually there's an almost as good alternative placement available. The exception might be the acquisition of one of the big colonies but even to those, alternatives exist. A Feast for Odin is a Caverna-style sandbox  rather than Agricola misery. I like the latter style better but it's another very solid Rosenberg. The thing that keeps me from buying for now, is the repetitive nature of covering the boards with a slew of materials. It's a feast which falters on the border of fun and work.

This may very well become my favourite Rosenberg title. It is more of a race game than most people seem to realise, especially as players become more skilled, as the interaction comes in ensuring you manage to achieve certain milestones before your opponents (especially the islands, which are usually the difference-maker). Very different from Uwe's other, more restrictive games. Much has been made of the fact that there are sixty-something action spaces, but honestly, it doesn't feel that overwhelming when you're playing. Brilliant, expansive, and absolutely wonderful to play.

I haven't played this enough to feel confident in my rating... and will admit that worker-placement isn't my thing, but definitely feel as though this game has a multitude of flaws. 

For one, setup and take-down are terrible, regardless of any inserts or baggie-systems you may devise. 

Second, AP is a huge problem, You will struggle to find 4 people where at least one doesn't clock for 5 minutes while the other 3 are telling him/her to just pick something.

Third, there is no real sense of "Epic" that a great game often has. I know pure euros such as this (or Terra Mystica which I adore) are often lacking here... so it isn't too specific a complaint. But even in Terra Mystica you sometimes pull off the perfect 'block' move or spend your entire 'bowl' to do something terrific (or stupid). This doesn't have that... and needs to do a better job at game-flow to make up for it, which it doesn't. 

I feel as though, after 2 plays, I would rate this an even 7 (I'm positive it will never fall below 6 nor climb above 8 for me).

A perfectly cromulent game, but at the end, I wonder, "Why?"

Why are we covering up these spaces on our board? Why do I lose points if I don't cover certain spaces? Why are the pieces such odd shapes? I like management games and love some of Uwe's other big (and not so big) designs. I also don't feel like the decision space is too large - it is much more manageable than I thought it would be.

But the exercise just seems kind of pointless. In Agricola there seems to be more direction, more struggle, more reward. But I leave A Feast for Odin feeling fairly dissatisfied. 

But don't point out all the flaws in my argument! Don't show me how my favorite games are also nonsensical in their implementation. Let me live in my fantasy world!

I really like this game, but it sure looks ugly on the table. The game is very addictive and there are some really cool ideas like the puzzle islands, rolling dice for action success (I loooove this) and the mountains filled with resources.

I wish it was a better looking game. I would have preferred buildings or some viking landscapes on the other side of the puzzle tiles, but that would have doubled the amount of them... anyway, it still is a very good game and its ugliness doesn't detract me that much, I would like to play it very often.

Classic Uwe Rosenberg.  An in-depth worker placement game that will make you pull hair out over what strategy is optimal for victory.  Despite the weight of the gameplay (and the game itself!), the rounds becoming intuitive and second nature after a few playthroughs.  This was part of our 10x10 challenge, and we must have played all 10 times in the span of a week.  We couldn't get it off the table.  Highly recommended for any fan of strategy, worker placement, or Uwe Rosenberg.

RATING: 9.5
The biggest worker placement game I have played, and one of my favorites of Uwe games so far. By far the favorite mechanism is the actions requiring different number of workers to use, and thus trying to figure out your sequence of actions round per round. If you are not a fan of solitaire games I definitely suggest look elsewhere, since this is a largely solitaire experience even at high player count. However, if you are looking for a cohesively designed, open-ended experience that is unparalleled to any other worker placement games, then look no further.

Considering all the material included in the box, the setup is surprisingly light and once you get a grasp of the action selection boards options, which are relatively straightforward, the game flows smoothly. I also feel that the mechanisms support the theme very well. The game just doesn't seem to work that well. It is very bloated and there are mechanisms included that make you scratch your head for why they have been included. Good examples of such mechanisms are the feast at end of any turn and the occupation cards. The cost of former is almost entirely covered by autoharvest and it seems to be a piece of justification for the multi-tiered goods system. The latter provides some random VP and mainly irrelevant special effects and only seems to be a piece of justification for the multi-cost action selection system. Towards the end the amount of bloatedness just keeps on growing when new vikings are added automatically into the game and the large action selection board is actually rather lacking in providing options. Tetris is generally a neat idea, but here it turns into an AP torpedo that finally sinks the whole game. Bloat.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.75
There is something almost perverse about the sheer quantity of goods included in the box and the expanse of options available to the player. Lest that comment be seen as a criticism, let me state clearly that I really like this game.

[i]A Feast for Odin[/i] is, by no means, the only game with a clear genealogy, but, perhaps because of my love of Rosenberg, it is a game whose genealogy is so clear and so omnipresent.

[i]Man vs Meeple[/i] described this game as Rosenberg's [i]magnum opus[/i] and, in a way, it is -- even though I don't think it's his best game. Early plays will simply be the board gaming equivalent of visiting a city whose language is unknown to you. My first impression is that picking a specific path is perhaps the best way to achieve a victory, but it's early days to confirm that yet.

I didn't think you could make a game this heavy about Tetris-pieces, but Uwe did it. I love how many differents paths it offers, with giving you room for about two and a half of the 5-6, which offers so much re-playability. 

That being said, very limited interaction in the worker placement is disappointing, but that just makes it a perfect solo game that is permanently set up on my basement table. This is the first solo game I really get into, and that's in large part thanks to GAFBlizzard's solo challenges.

Once again Uwe comes through with a solid worker placement game.  The individual player home boards and the manner in which they're completed is very reminiscent of Patchwork while the central action board recalls the various worker actions of Fields of Arle.  The Viking theme is the best and most engaging since the harbor and shipping theme of Le Havre.  The game is fun and entertaining and plays rather quickly.  The only weakness of the game is the fiddly nature of the player boards.  Manipulating and placing the tiny goods and silver pieces as one tries to discover the best fit into the proper spaces somehow seems silly at times.  Make sure you don't drop an occupation card or an errant goods tile onto your player board mid-game. 

My low enthusiasm for the Patchwork nature of the player boards will be the deciding factor in whether I want to invest in my own copy of this game as opposed to simply playing others' copies when the opportunities arise.

Update:  Despite my feelings about the tetris aspect, this game continues to keep my interest and I think it will soon be a part of my library.

A kÃ¶zponti tÃ¡bla egyÃ¡ltalÃ¡n nem praktikus, Ã¡llandÃ³an fel kell emelni a bÃ¡bukat, hogy megnÃ©zzÃ¼k, ki mit is vitt, meg milyen akciÃ³ volt alatta (pl. a mÃ¡solÃ¡s miatt fontos tudni).
Ezen a szinten a kockadobÃ¡lÃ¡ssal vadÃ¡szatot, halÃ¡szatot, fosztogatÃ¡st is nehÃ©z Ã©rtelmezni... Ha ezt hevijurÃ³kÃ©nt kezeljÃ¼k, akkor valÃ³ban szÃ¼ksÃ©g van arra, hogy pusztÃ¡n a kockadobÃ¡s miatt kÃ¶nnyebben/nehezebben boldoguljunk jÃ³nÃ©hÃ¡ny akciÃ³nÃ¡l? Mintha Ã¶nmagÃ¡ban az nem lenne elÃ©g, hogy a brutÃ¡lisan sok kÃ¡rtyÃ¡bÃ³l Ã­gy is elÃ©g Ã¶ssze-vissza lehetÅsÃ©geket hÃºzunk fel.

Ãs az egÃ©sz csak arrÃ³l szÃ³l, hogy a tÃ¡blÃ¡nkon minÃ©l tÃ¶bb mezÅt lefedjÃ¼nk teljesen megmagyarÃ¡zhatatlan szabÃ¡lyok szerint (pl. hogy a zÃ¶ld lapkÃ¡k csak a sarkukkal Ã©rintkezhetnek). TehÃ¡t megy a tetrisz csak azÃ©rt, hogy a vÃ©gÃ©n minÃ©l kevesebb negatÃ­v pontot kapjunk. HÃ¡t aki ebbe vadÃ¡szatot, halÃ¡szatot, fosztogatÃ¡st, hajÃ³Ã©pÃ­tÃ©st, vagy bÃ¡rmi mÃ¡st bele tud lÃ¡tni... Nekem nem megy. Ennyire szÃ¡raz, tematikÃ¡tlan, Ã¶ncÃ©lÃºan Ã¶sszehalmozott mechanikarengeteggel rÃ©gen talÃ¡lkoztam.

Egy pozitÃ­vum azÃ©rt van a Feast for Odinban... Ennek a mellÃ©ktermÃ©kekÃ©nt szÃ¼letett meg a Patchwork. Az legalÃ¡bb egy elegÃ¡ns, hangulatos kis absztrakt jÃ¡tÃ©k. Ezek a jelzÅk kÃ¶zÃ¼l csak az absztrakt igaz az Odinra...

Uwe Rosenberg through and through. The Agricola model grew up and expanded into Caverna, which subsequently devoured and digested Patchwork, thus becoming a touch bloated and unwieldy in A Feast for Odin. Not bad at all, but I can't imagine trying to parse out the dozens of possible actions without the prior experience of having played those previous Rosenberg games.

I love worker placements. However in this one, it is very difficult to block someone because there are so many choices. You never have to fret someone stealing your spot.

[size=12][b]Why I dislike A Feast For Odin:[/b][/size]
- There are too many decisions to make. I describe this as a flaw because plenty of games manage to add depth with fewer decisions.
- I am uninterested in the Vikings theme in regards to euro games because the thematic ties often make no sense. In this game why do Vikings care about what order the food is delivered.  
- I was not a fan oF Patchwork so the placement of tiles in your patch of land did not appeal to me.
- The game is hard to teach

After two 4 player games, a 3 player and three solo plays.  The randomness of the cards and dice are just enough to keep replay-ability high yet not to swingy.  This is in comparison to some of Rosenberg's other games that start to feel repetitive after multiple plays.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

I wasn't as enamored with this as I thought I might be. There is very little semblance to Patchwork unlike I was led to believe (and sadly so!). This feels much more like Fields of Arle to me with varied ways to score tons of points. It isn't quite the sandbox that Arle is, but I'd rather just play Arle. Seems odd to have a die roll mechanic in this one as well with a couple of the actions - although they are stronger actions so I understand it to some degree. There is a ton of planning ahead in this one - I almost feel like it could be a solved puzzle after enough time if it wasn't for the fact that people could go to the spot you needed blocking you from your perfect plan. I expect to play again, but I'm not sure I had fun. Maybe next time.

RATING: 8
Ein Puzzlespiel der Superlative mit einem Arbeiter Einsetz Mechanismus.
Wer an der Reihe ist setzt einen seiner Wikinger auf ein Aktionsfeldâ¦ usw. und so fortâ¦
Im Spiel erhÃ¤lt man verschiedene PlÃ¤ttchen, die unterschiedliche Formen und Farben haben kÃ¶nnen.
Diese werden gebraucht um seine Landschaft voll zu puzzeln und dadurch weniger Minuspunkte am Spielende zu erhalten, aber auch wÃ¤hrend dem Spiel Bonis in Form von hÃ¶herem Einkommen und zusÃ¤tzlichen Ressourcen und sie werden auch gebraucht um seine Arbeiter zu ernÃ¤hren (indem man eine Reihe damit puzzelt, die umso lÃ¤nger wird, je mehr Arbeiter ich erhalte (automatisch einen pro Runde mehr).
Das Spiel hat tatsÃ¤chlich SpaÃ gemacht und wenn die Puzzlerrei nicht wÃ¤re, dann wÃ¤re es auch ein tolles Spiel!
Ich weiss nicht und kann mir auch nicht vorstellen, dass die Wikinger damals ihre Beute mit veredeltem Essen und StrickjÃ¤ckchen auf dem Boden verstreut zusammengepuzzelt haben, dazwischen noch SilbermÃ¼nzen und Granit verstreut.
Auch, dass 6 Arbeiter von einem ganzen StÃ¼ck "Wal" nicht satt werden, aber von einem Humpen Met und 3 Halmen Stroh sehr wohl...
FÃ¼r mich ist das Thema vÃ¶llig aufgesetzt, aber okay, es ist ein Euro-Game!
Man nimmt halt was man kriegen kann, grÃ¶Ãer ist meisst die bessere Wahl, wertet es dann soweit auf, dass es irgendwie auf seine Insel drauf passt, streut noch ein paar 1-er MÃ¼nzen dazwischen, so dass man frÃ¼hzeitig ein hohes Einkommen hat. Mit dem kann man in kÃ¼nftigen Runden wieder schÃ¶n LÃ¼cken stopfen und bekommt seinen Plan ganz gut voll...
Wem es SpaÃ macht... mir leider nicht wirklich, auch wenn ich froh bin es gespielt haben zu kÃ¶nnen!

It's a well-thought out game.  Very interesting, complex ways of winning in a point-salad style game.  Nice components, lots of options, interesting resource and production mechanics.
I just wish there was some level of interaction between players.  It's truly a solitaire game you can play near people.   I wish the level of thought that went into some of the optional resource and victory point mechanics also went into interaction mechanics.

The game play isn't overly simple either, so the game requires that you find gamers who are comfortable with resource mechanics...who also like playing solitaire games near you.  And that's ultimately why the game is heavily mood dependent.

A simply amazing game. I love this game with all of my heart and it was not what I thought it was going to be before my first play. While the large number of rules, boards, tokens, and game pieces make it seem really complex, all of the rules are quite simple and it is really easy to pick up. While I will admit that there is very little player interaction the game is quite zen overall.

I enjoyed A Feast for Odin. I like the tetris elements and the way that the worker placement worked. But I thought that the cards were too random and brought luck into a fairly strategic game in a way that I didn't like. I'd maybe enjoy more drafting options and board wipes every round or so? But how they are in the rules was just too random for me.

All you can say about this game is "wow". Uwe has done it again! The game explores some of the mechanics that he often plays with, but is brilliantly layered with new and subtle elements, making it quite unique. It keeps you busy during other players' turns trying to puzzle out piece placement on your home boards, so downtime is not an issue. The look of the game is quite beautiful, too. A Feast for Odin is a triumph of a game design offering vast numbers of choices and a grandiose feel. An instant classic!

I played this game once so far and will update this rating.  Initially I did like it that much.  The biggest issue I hve is the overwhelming number of choices at the start of game.  It is difficult to even get a sense of what you need to do in this game.  The vast number of items you can select are annoying. It seems like some options are worthless without occupations.  And you may not have received the occupation at the start.  I can actually see my rating going down rather than up.  It may be the only Uwe Rosenberg game I don't like.  There is just too many mechanisms in the game and it does not feel fun.

For now I enjoy this as much as Caverna, although I'm curious to see whether it will feel to 'loose' or not after I'm more familiar with the game.

I am starting to feel like there are actually two layers of complexity here. At first glance, it is a medium heavy worker placement that will not punish you too badly for just getting big tiles and covering as many spaces as possible. After a few plays, however, I started to see that getting the right tiles means getting the most efficient tiles. What matters isnât just size, but a cost/benefit ratio: does a tile cover a reasonable amount of -1 spaces (rather than just any spaces) for what you are investing?â. This means that large tiles are often wasteful. This makes the game work on two levels for me: placing and buying tiles is just a really satisfying activity in itself, but underneath it is a puzzle that actually rewards precision and is a great deal more complex than it might look at first glance.

I've played a few multiplayer games, but they really take too long (around 4 hours), so it's only a solo game for me now. (Being a rather experienced player now because of all the solo play, it wouldn't be fair to play multiplayer against less experienced players)

far more choices so your not just standing in line.  Cards are plentiful and feel like they have the proper impact.  Your growing at a good pace.  Plenty of points to be had but your choice must go in a beneficial order for you to win.  

The raiding and whaling feels out of place as its hard to do and your delt random cards to contribute to that.

I do like this game and I think its very well made with a lot of parts that make sence but I'd never really feel excited about playing.  For all of its nice art its to abstract to really get into.

Highest solo score so far: 132. 
Have played solo half a dozen times. Finally at my fifth solo game I passed the 100 pts mark. I had tried farming strategy before, pillaging, whaling and crafting but faulted in not expanding enough. It's definitely necessary it seems for one to go for the exploration tiles. The extra income and bonuses just make it worth. I'm sure the game is balanced, but in my plays I have been more succesful on dedicating to pillaging/raiding. I guess because I am more focused on that strategy than in others, as farming requires one to diversify more. Raiding/pillaging with occasional whaling helped me reach the 100 pt mark.

Loved Agricola, Love Caverna, and this seems promising.  Have only played once, but I would love to play again.  Yes, there is a lot going on, but you simply won't do everything.  AFfO seems to be more lenient on letting you focus on one path or another without dinging you for not doing at least a bit of everything, as you see in Agricola and Caverna.  Yes, you have to cover your board up pretty good, and yes you have to feed your people, other than that you're welcome to focus on one thing and ignore another.

First thing when punching this game: component quality is lacking; I would consider the game a "throw-away" (as it falls apart) rather than fight tooth and nail to keep it in pristine condition.

Gameplay-wise, it is decent. Not a game that I WANT to play, but I would not hesitate to play if another wanted to play it. Not my favorite Uwe Rosenberg game, but not my least favorite. Ultimate the game falls into a category of "decent game, but I rather spend my time and money on something else."

FUN: there a lot of different options open to you every single turn, yet you still agonize over what to do and fear a blocking move from your opponents. Also, most elements are tied together very well from a thematic standpoint.

UNIQUE: the spacial element is really quite clever as it drives the upgrading of your goods, provides a way to build your income and is an essential part of the scoring without introducing a lot of rules.

NEGATIVES: it is a bit long and it could stand to lose an element or two make the game feel a bit tighter.

I admire the design but I didnÂ´t enjoy the game very much. Solo tetris is rarely something I enjoy, and here it was a particularly unthematic part of an otherwise thematic game.

Le Havre is still my favourite among the Agricolas.

Then suddenly everything made sense and I wanted to start the game all over again.   I mean - as it is, I came in 2nd of 5 so I'm not complaining.  But it still felt like I was a little in the dark until I was able to see the whole game at the end.   I really want to get this back onto the table soon!

RATING: 10
A really enjoyable game. Great theme, well implemented, lots of complexity and plenty of replay ability due to different role cards.  Lots of options and many ways to grab points.  Not as punishing as Agricola and more fun as a result.  Want a copy but it is expensive ... an easy 8 to begin and expect to go higher with further plays.

After 7 plays, upped to a  10.  Simply sublime. A fantastic combination of simple mechanics, freedom to operate (multiple strategies), great theme, nice presentation. Love it all.

An engaging game with a hodgepodge of mechanisms that flow together beautifully. I no longer have concerns about the random elements of the game, in particular the dice. There is enough compensation that failure is not soul crushing but enough on the line that success feels great. 

Perhaps my favorite Uwe yet, though time will tell.

Enjoyable first play. Felt like Fields of Arle with some of the occupation cards from Agricola. I like this more than Caverna but probably not as much as Agricola.  I prefer to start with a hand of cards rather than only getting one and drawing along the way. Has a bit too much of a sandbox feel for me even with the cards. My opinion may change with more plays.

RATING: 7
Enjoyed it more than I expected to, more than Agricola and Arle, in any event.  I get absolutely no impression that I am a Viking, and they have some bizarrely odd rules, and the Tetris thing is really very silly if you try and think about it at all.  Still, too much finagleing for an abstract, so they had to give it a theme, I suppose.  The overwrought monstrosity of bits kind of adds to it in a humorous way.  Lots of space to explore, I think.

Second game: I actually won, 78-52 vs Jerome

RATING: 8
Huge space to explore, requiring multiple plays to see and try everything.  Not nearly as complicated as it looks.  Build-up is tactile and satisfying.  Lots of paths to take, but the only thing stopping you from taking the same path every game is your opponent.  Not very interactive until players are familiar with the game, but still a good challenge.

A worker placement masterpiece. So much depth and multiple routes the victory. I love the puzzle aspect of the player board. The component quality is top notch and once  each player understands the game significant amount of replayability because of the hundreds of occupation cards. Plays amazing at all player counts. My only gripe with the game is teaching it because of the 60+ spaces on the main board that need explanation.

Post-2010 Rosenberg has been a hard sell for me. The lighter fare is uncompelling. The heavy stuff feels overwrought. I can't properly rate Feast on one play, but I'm not currently motivated to play more. Sure, there are lots of different things to try, but all to the end of acquiring polyominos to cover a board. I feel my time is better spent with other games, but more plays may change my mind. If they happen.

Uwe Rosenberg's star continues to rise. This is simply superb. So many options, none of then wrong per se but some will suit your situation better than others.

Initial rating after 3 solo plays. It's easy to call this one of the best Rosenberg games yet and possibly his best solo implementation. While much here is familiar from his past work, I find this to be yet another interesting evolution with plenty to make it stand on its own. Finally, I find the game to be quite thematic (though, admittedly, the puzzling component lacks a good thematic explanation).

RATING: 9
Very solid. It's going to take more plays to be sure, but I'm seeing this as a top-5 Uwe game (with Agricola, Fields of Arle and Ora et Labora being my current top-3). Our first game took us three hours, but those three hours flew by. Lots of things to do, yet still conflict for spots, at least in the four-player game. What a delightful game.

Enthusiastic.

This would seem to be the culmination of Rosenberg's worker placement, resource conversion catalog. It's very similar to Fields of Arle, adding cards, and of course, the manipulation of tiles on maps, easily the most unique aspect of the game. I have great respect for the design and I understand why so many people have derived enjoyment from it. However, I think it's stretched me beyond my limit, as the game is rather long, incredibly fiddly, and devoid of much tension. It almost strikes me as a pastime as much as a game, and I can see why folks enjoy the solitaire approach so much. It's surely a good game, but I think I've had my fill. Despite the great variety of strategic paths, the 61 spaces to place your Vikings, and the various avenues to explore, there's a sameness about the actions and an odd redundancy that limits the excitement.

Sandbox game with a lot - did I say a lot? - of components. First you don't know what to chose from the 61 worker spaces that are provided in the beginning but after a couple of rounds it starts to make sense on how to fill up your home board to minimize point loss. It's a difficult game but much easier than say Terra Mystica. My oldest son was already interested to play this one and I think he probably would be able to play this game soon.

Only played solitaire game and made an error on the 3 and 4 viking spots forgetting that I could have taken a worker card. Also forgot about the income of one weapon every round which would have made the whale hunting easier. Houses can hold food that you might end up with not being able to put on your home board or islands. The only downside for now is the wonky weapon cards - they don't seem to fit in the rest of the game but maybe I need to play more to appreciate them.

The solo game works really well with the workers from the previous round blocking the action board for the current round. Ideal pastime but also a good learning experience for the game itself. Overall an enjoyable experience - much better than Caverna which feeled too 'sandbox' for me - and filling up the homeland and discovered islands patchwork style is always a neat thing

The more I play this game - the more I like it. Solo game is really good - trying to get as many points as possible - still trying to get above the 100 point treshold though... current high score is 66.

Maybe the best Rosenberg game and easily sits in my top 3 of all games for the moment!

RATING: 9
The actual 'Feast' in this game is the amount of board game goodness you get in the massively heavy box that you are presented with upon opening. Seriously I am trying to think of another game that was this heavy. Even after punching out all the components it is still weighty. In any event, skip the gym the day this arrives at your place. The game itself is visually very busy but it's not a terribly complex game. The wonderful dilemma is for each player to decide what the heck they should do on their turn from the 60 options available to them and how that will impact their board over the course of 7 rounds. I'll be blunt and say your first game will literally just be like walking into a new workplace and meeting all the people and finding when the packing tape is. Leaving that first game now makes me more confident about what I can do next time to fully tap the potential of this game and the best bit is that I'm not frustrated or upset by that. It's like an intricate puzzle that needs to be solved carefully and every play through will make you better and more powerful. Rulebooks are amazing in this game and to even have a historical appendix is amazing to add extra flavour to the game. Hard to find much fault here but will work well with patient game groups as it is not a casual game by any stretch. Enjoy the unboxing and happy playing :)

I've had a chance to play this at 1 and 2 player counts. As a solo game, it really screams joyously. As a multiplayer game, it feels like several people playing the solo game together.

Big box for a game with a billion pieces. The game itself is fine. It's a production line of exchanging pieces to try and get the good ones that score you points. The viking theme is wafer thin, and the game is probably too long for what it is. The puzzle aspect is cool, but why not actually play patchwork? The chrome on this one serves little purpose other than to add more things to do.

This was actually the 1st Uwe Rosenberg game I played and I loved it.  So many things to do and a lot of really awesome Euro concepts.  It looks foreboding but is very simple.  As with most Z-Man games it has a tone of components.  Also the background for a lot of the items in the game is an awesome addition.  My 89 year old grandmother really liked all of the Scandinavian history.

This game has more of everything but in a bad way. Innumerous actions let the players chose their paths with little interaction to acquire and convert intricately related cards and resources - all with the purpose of laying a puzzle of differently shaped tiles on a player board.

Uwe Rosenberg in all his glory.  This game may be the one referred to as his magnum opus at the end of his career.  The game takes interesting pieces of several of his more popular game and blends them into a sandbox, point salad game that builds up over time.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
The game has a very open and (on first play) an overwhelming amount of choices.  This was very offputting to the new players.  However, after a couple days of begging we were able to get on to the 2nd play and the game had a very quick pace and we were much more able to see the opportunities and tailor our gameplay.

We figured out the storage solution as well (ignored the suggested setup) and I came up with a way to have everything in the 2 trays in a logical presentation.  This made a huge difference and streamlined things.  For the number of components it has it is surprisingly not as fiddly as a game like Agricola which is in my top 5.

I appreciate the inclusion of the occupations and how you can get them into play also how everyone grows their clan at the same rate.  This helps to keep the focus on the dynamic gameplay.

The luck factor with the dice included is a bit concerning so I try not to rely on it too much.  However, it is making a difference in the games played.  This eliminates deterministic "combat" but at a cost.  I am OK with it.  Just know that a skilled player who gets the rolls will likely be impossible to beat.

Definitely has the cool factor with how everything works together.  This one clobbers the other 2 cardboard vomits from UR (Caverna and Fields of Arle) as it feels more dynamic and "different" each time and worth the setup which is very minimal now.

This is another winner from UR and competes with my favorites of his (Agricola, Le Havre, Glass Road and even Merkator)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I knew this was really special even by Uwe standards when I read the rules and found that even the "feast" follows the same jigsaw-puzzle-type play as filling your home board, rather than items being worth X amount of food each.

Drawing one occupation at the start and the rest as you go is also a huge improvement on a hand of 14 to read before you begin Agricola.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Great worker placement game with good reply value. In multiplayer, puzzling pieces onto your own board significantly limits down time during other players turns. As a solo game, the self blocking mechanism is a really clever way to maintain the interesting tensions of worker placement that are otherwise lost when played solo. 
 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
So many different paths to glory, and while there's so very, very much to wrap your head around first, it seems to work so wonderfully when you do!  Interaction can be as great or as little as you like.  Very satisfying to come away from having felt like you've played a game.
Unlikely to satisfy those looking for a tightly competitive game - feels like the polar opposite of Agricola.

By far the most difficult game I own and have ever played (As of June 5, 2017, no longer the case). Getting into the rules and referring back to them, especially in the first game, felt tiresome. But once the machine gets going, you get a nice rhythm going in the solo game (only mode I've played thus far). The choices really do make each playthrough unique. Pumping through the occupation cards is the real winner to help the machine get going. On multiple plays, I've had 2-4 cards that combo'ed into each other one at a time, making for big plays anytime one of them went off. This has a lot of longevity and could climb as I get better and others experience the game with me.

Still have yet to play the multiplayer, but so far, I've not had a bad moment with the game after learning it.

Initial Review: 8.75
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.8
A wonderfully complex and confusing game (in a good way).

Initial set of actions that you are presented with can be whittled down quite quickly. As with other Uwe games, there is a clear direction to cover up or mitigate the effect of all those "-1" squares on the board. However, how you do so is up to you.

This is a worker placement game with tons of options to choose from.  Ultimately you're trying to gain pieces to cover your player board so that you get the most points and bonuses.  I've played this game a half dozen times and have had a lot of fun each time.  Buying or making a box organizer for the game makes setup and tear down much less tedious because there are A LOT of pieces in this game.  This is definitely one of my favorite games.

Looks intimidating at setup but is quite simple to run after that. Very little blocking happening, so this is mainly a solitaire affair. I don't mind the dice, since those are both controllable and thematically sound, but the occupation cards are massively luck-based.

Takes a very long time to play in our group. For that kind of time investment, I'd prefer more competition and story arc. Now this is just everyone tinkering at their own boards, doing the same thing all the time.

Il buon Uwe Rosenberg non si smentisce mai. Nuovo gioco senza troppa originalitÃ , meccaniche e idee simili ai suoi classici capolavori, malgrado ciÃ² il gioco piace e gira molto bene. Ampia scelta di azioni da fare per riuscire a massimizzare la produzione e il guadagno di ogni turno oltre a dover 'offrire' un banchetto al termine di ogni turno che potrebbe risultare dispendioso. Gioco che gira tremendamente bene e che offre molte vie strategiche. Alla fine potrebbe anche risultare abbastanza solitario se le scelte strategiche dei giocatori saranno differenti. Ancora una volta Uwe, senza spiccare per originalitÃ , non ha sbagliato gioco.

[b]A Feast for Odin[/b] + [i]A Feast for Odin: Lofoten, Orkney, and Tierra del Fuego[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (10 -> [b]10[/b]):[/COLOR]

[i]A Feast for Odin took my house by storm, both of my older kids enjoy it and we still look forward to our next session. I struggle to rate my favorite Uwe designs, but Odin would be in the top three (along with Le Havre and Glass Road... I think). Different strategies continue to be uncovered, especially once you start to recognize how the different occupations work with other actions in the game [i](in our first plays the occupations didn't seem as powerful as they can be)[/i]. 

I'm drawn to any type of spacial puzzle, so there is a huge appeal to the Tetris aspect of game play which may not be as fun to other players. Add onto that amount of choice you have in Odin and this is a game that will continue to get lots of play. I haven't played solo yet, but I'm looking forward to trying it. I think it will be a tight experience since you play two colors and each round the previously used workers stay on the board blocking those spaces.

I definitely prefer the game at lower player counts, the 4p game goes long and there is serious downtime between turns. Outside of player count I can't think of anything I don't like about Feast for Odin, since my first play I have been enamored with the game and I'm always looking forward to my next play.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (10):[/COLOR]

[i]I am so happy I got to play this one nine times this month, I can't get enough of it. It seems like something has clicked on every other play. And for those of you that have played my best games haven't involved emigration [i](as easy as it supposed to be, it has eluded me). Uwe is by far my favorite designer (from heavy games like this to card games like Bargain Hunter and Mamma Mia) and it is becoming more and more difficult for me to pick my favorites. At this point I've played all of Uwe's heavier games and at a minimum Odin is in the top 3; fighting for space with Agricola, Ora et Labora and Glass Road. 

Highlights:

- Goods upgrades - Good can be upgraded 4 times making for a really challenging puzzle to solve which leads to the actual spacial aspect of the game...
- Tile laying Tetris style! I love figuring out the puzzle every game, it is extremely satisfying.
- Occupation cards are back! Yes they are not quite as central to the game as in Agricola, but they add tons of variety to the game and figuring out how to find synergies between them while sometimes difficult is extremely rewarding.
- Worker placement board: having to manage your vikings is yet another challenging prospect. While it is enticing to focus on the one and two viking spaces, those three and four viking spaces are really powerful plus they either grant you the opportunity to draw or play an occupation.
- Surprisingly intuitive after a play or two, my eleven year old daughter has had great success playing Odin as opposed to some of his other heavy games.[/i]

The best of Uwe Rosenberg games I have played. So deep, so in depth, so many strategies I can't even keep up. I really love heavy euro's. This one takes the cake.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
A monster euro? Wargamers have used the term "monster" to apply to their huge games with thousands of counters and a rulebook that rivals a doctoral dissertation. However, this is the first monster euro that I have encountered. It has some connection to Rosenberg's "Fields of Arle" which I enjoyed but this one is even more massive. 

I just got this but after reading over the rulebook, I was relieved to see that it is only massive in terms of components. In game play, it seems to be quite accessible. I will wait until I have played it to rate it.

Okay, I was wrong. For a Rosenberg game, it takes too long and is too prone to AP. Fields of Arle and Ora et Labora remain my two favorite Rosenberg titles. As for Feast of Odin, I haven't decided yet but I may sell it to a mate who was interested in buying it. I don't see myself playing it again but you never know.

Pure Uwe perfection...
Builds on the shoulders of the earlier games to offer so many choices and such intriguing gameplay. 
Probably even better solo than Arle as it has the random elements of earlier games.
This game is right up there

RATING: 9
It seems I can't get enough Rosenberg. This is another hit for me. It is again a "sandbox" like Arle but has even more guiding startup randomness to help you choose a unique strategy thanks to the return of Agricola's beloved Occupation cards! I enjoy this one quite a bit and the puzzle of laying things out is definitely unique. I could see this one rising in ranks with more plays and as I get better at it.

1 Play - After an initial play (3 player) I felt this was one of the better Uwe Rosenberg designs. The key mechanism is filling up a grid with different shaped items (aka Tetris or Barenpark with added complexity), using worker placement to get said items. A part from the crazy busy main board that is jam packed with different action/ reward combinations, the game is pretty 'elegant'. While you're actually managing quite a lot of options and information, its never overbearing or taxing to play. There's feeding, but it doesn't feel constrained at all. I like that there's a short/ long game option.

At setup, this game looks like it would be extremely fiddly, but surprisingly it wasn't so. Unlike Caverna/ Agricola, there is very little to "fill up/ refresh" each round and once your tiny tokens are placed on your player mat, they don't move again. The game comes with trays for all the different shaped tokens which keep everything organised and are never removed unless you need them. 

There is some die rolling in this game (with a d8/ d12). With dice like this, obviously there's some high variability in what you can roll, but ultimately there are a loads of ways to mitigate your rolls and also consolation rewards if you were unable to roll what you had hoped. You also are allowed to roll three times, so there's a small push-your luck element of re-rolling/ keeping a mediocre roll. Ultimately, rolling poor might mean the equivalent of losing a pip or two on a dice (in other games) and adds just that little bit of tension to the game. I should note, it is almost completely (entirely?) avoidable if you should so choose.

There's a little more luck in the card draws, but ultimately this again doesn't seem to worry me either, as each has their use and is just another obstacle in figuring out an optimal answer to the puzzle you're presented with. 

My only real nitpick, is that Feast for Odin isn't really the type of game that gives you huge 'wow moments', have you sweating about a myriad of 'what-ifs' or cause you nostalgia about something you once created. The fun is really in finding a strategic focus, while simply accumulating and hoarding things. It perhaps is not as 'exciting' as other games, but at the same time, it's hard to criticize a game for something it definitely was never aiming to do.   

Overall, I was surprised that this game was as good as it was, as I'd had friends who did not like it quite as much. I would happily play anytime and suspect the tetris/ Barenpark part of the game is something my partner would enjoy a lot. I'm not too sure about replayability, as a lot of the game is either static/ non-variable or very same-samey. I will have to come back with a further edit.

Not elegant...at all, but incredibly expansive. You want to play again immediately to try out different strategies and attempt to optimize. I was a little meh on the tile laying aspect, but I liked the tile development aspect a lot.

I somewhat enjoyed my play of it, though I think the game vastly overstays its welcome.  But I also think the game shares a characteristic of many of Rosenberg's games: just way too much to keep track of.  There are chits and pieces all over the table, lots of player boards, lots and lots of resources, many layers of conversion, and tons and tons of action spaces.  I think the objective of covering your player board spatially is interesting, but I think too much complexity and fiddliness stands in the way of that objective and that objective is done better in Cottage Garden and Patchwork (and if I am allowed to pull from another designer, it is also done better in Quadropolis).  One other complaint is that with so many options available on a turn, the game feels more solitaire than most worker placement games. Normally I am not overly negative of such a feature, but the fact that a four player game takes over three hours seriously exacerbates this problem. I read that when Uwe was designing Agricola many years ago, his goal was to create a better Caylus; he has never come close.  In fact, I don't think he has even bested Stone Age.

The best Uwe Rosenberg-game yet. It encompasses improvements from all his previous games and is thematically astounding.

After you understand the basics, playing it is really straightforward and a joy.

A Feast for Odin is a worker placement with a giant action board that has 60+ different actions to take, with spaces costing different numbers of workers. While there's obviously a great variety of ways to get there, everything boils down to either getting food for each turn's feast (which of course gets bigger every turn) or getting tiles to tetris onto your player board to either increase your income or eliminate -1 point spaces. The variety in the game is a little overwhelming at first, but you do get the hang of it. There are quite a few little fiddly rules, and it's difficult to find things in the rulebooks. The tetris thing was cool, but I wish there were more large oddly-shaped pieces. On the whole, the game was pretty fun and definitely very Rosenberg-y, I think most comparable to Fields of Arle.

RATING: 3
Where to even start with this one? So the rules for it were...okay, I guess. I'm sure they're all there, but it took me two full read throughs to parse together what the hell you're able to do and when. It's like a weird amalgamation of Patchwork and Fields of Arle. There are a TON of different chits and cards to play with and none really make much of a difference except for size and the actual color of the chit. You don't really have a direction in this game except to fill up your board. I'm not even entirely sure where or how to get points, just how to reduce down negative points. I always feel like I'm wondering aimlessly in this game.

I don't really see the appeal in this game. Outside of gathering pieces to reduce down your negative score, there is no tension in the game. With 60+ options to choose from each round, you don't feel blocked even if someone does take an action you were planning on. The tetris aspect is better done in a shorter game like Patchwork and the lack of tension is done better in games like Ora et Labora or Fields of Arle. The game just feels like it has too much going on yet has no substance whatsoever. It's like eating a bag of chips for dinner. Sure you're full, but you're unsatisfied afterwards.

I'm not surprised this is a hit with people, but I won't be autobuying Uwe games any more from the lack of excitement I've gotten from his last big box releases.

This game was massive and kind of scary when I first picked it up to learn... 3 different books, so many pieces and bits, but it is a really intuitive game. The choices all feel natural. It is such a rich game. It might seem kind of long on the paper, but when you're playing it doesn't feel like it. The rulebook is reslly really easy to read and finding answers is really easy, really well done, I've had bad experiences with rulebooks for games that have considerably less pages than with this one (Champions of Midgard rulebook, for example, is awful). There's another book for the occupation cards that you must have at hand when playing that is neccesary and easy on gameplay, and a context booklet for some explanation of stuff in relation with theme.

The hunting and pillaging mechanism with the dice really work and become exciting, specially the hunting. People often like the Cow/Sheep pregnant mechanism.

I've played with different groups and until now all of them have enjoyed it. Even my 6th play of it, with a sort of newbie player turned out really good, even though he was kind of nervous at first with the rules explanation, once he started playing he picked it up quickly and was making reslly great decisions.

The occupation cards in my oppinion MUST be houseruled as Three visible ones with option for blind drafting from the deck (As in TTR). Tihs way it becomes more of a choice, and you do not end up with a lot of cards you might not want. It becomes more of a choice than luck. 

Great game, highly recommend it. Works great as a solo game, shines at all player counts.

"Here are 60 actions you can do! But... You will be doing the same 3 until the end of the game".

If you like repeating the same thing over and over for an hour or more, then you're gonna love this game.

The game basically discourages you from mixing it up, so if you want to win, you'll have to rinse and repeat what you've been doing the past rounds. Boring. Tedious.

I really enjoy it.  the variety is like caverna but better.  there are a lot of viable strategies that make the game very replayable.  doesn't have quite the ruthless feel of agricola though.  think my preferred order is agricola > aFfO > caverna even though i think this is better designed.

Mr. Rosenberg mixed Agricola with Patchwork and the result is yet another hit. An excellent game with a well implemented theme. Which is all the more surprising when you consider that a large part of the game is filling your boards (homeland and colonies) with differently shaped pieces in a tetris-like fashion.

The moment of truth! A game I have been anxiously awaiting for since last year. The next big Uwe R game! I wrote up a [thread=1658399]long review[/thread], but if you are a regular to my blog then it was posted recently. Spatial element to this game and can be considered fairly abstract. I enjoy that, but I mostly enjoy the abundance of options with actually a lot of limited availability to resources you might want or need. Very clever. I don't think it will ever be superior to [thing=159675][/thing](10/10), but perhaps it might pass [thing=102794][/thing] (10/10) sometime. At the moment the game is still so new, I am not sure how it will all pan out in the coming months. So far I love it, and I am excited for the future! Still makes my top 20 list easy.

Incredibly busy - so many options with so many ways of converting so many resources. You always feel like you have choices to make, which is good. It is hard to determine which choices are better than others, however. You can't rely on multiple playthroughs to learn because of how long it takes to play. Monolithic and hard to take off the shelf, but generally fun the whole time and simple to learn play.

Has the potential to be overwhelming at first. If you don't like sandbox games then it's best to stay away from. Personally I really enjoyed it, but you definitely have to accept that you're just going to be taking more of "I'll try this out and see where it goes" approach, at least for the first few games. Deserves further replays.

RATING: 10
This game is a fascinating puzzle. The general idea is you have a personal board, that you want to pretty much fill with tiles of different shapes. The problem is, doing that isn't nearly enough to get you the win, as you can also buy or discover additional boards of different sizes and complication that also want to get covered with tiles. The tiles come from taking actions on the massive worker placement board. Well, I say massive, but it's actually way too small for the amount of information printed on it. It's a two fold board, and could easily be 1.5x the size it was printed at, and then it would be a lot easier to read. As you build up your boards, they will also produce money, resources and tiles for you, and doing this is a crucial part of building an actual engine in this game. At the start of the game, filling everything seems impossible, and by the end you have more tiles than you could actually use. I don't know what the staying power of this game will be, but I do know I'm addicted to the point that I'd actually consider trying this solo, which is something I rarely ever do.

Rules explanation took a long time, but once you start playing, the game is very intuitive. The enormous decision space looks intimidating at first, but it turns out you don't need to use all of them in each game. You can focus on whatever you want to get points. After a couple of games, all of the action spaces will become familiar to you. The polyominoes touch is pretty neat as an ode to Patchwork. This is a beast of a game with the huge box and tons of components. A little too sandboxy for me, but still decent.

Played this solo only thus far, but this is a fantastic solo game, by far the best out of Rosenberg's solo offerings, and one of my new favorites to play solo already. 
Very much looking forward to playing this with others. I'm a huge fan of Agricola and Caverna, and this is another masterful game from Uwe. I suspect I may rate this a 10 with a few more plays. Fantastic game.

At this point this is the best solo game I've ever played. I think it works particularly well compared to Uwe's other similar offerings for a few main reasons. Occupations provide needed replayability with different strategies and routes opening up. The dice mean you are not assured of some actions and that risk opens up different paths even if you try to take the exact same strategy as a previous time. Finally, the massive action board but the self blocking mechanism means there is plenty to explore and try and you are somewhat forced to diversify and try out the different things this game has to offer. Finally, the puzzling of different pieces will give this game plenty of legs as there are so many combinations of ways to fill your various boards, there will always be some new challenge every game in making your pieces go the farthest. 

I cannot wait to get a few multiplayer games in. Right now I suspect I shall give this a 10 after a few more plays as I have yet to find a reason it shouldn't be. This is just about everything I'd want in a game. Tons of paths to victory, plenty of replayability offered up via occupations and dice results which inject different outcomes into the game even if you try the exact same strategies. The competition is largely indirect which I personally prefer. There is a nice theme and the almanac that provides explanations for the things in the game is a great touch to really seal in the thematic decisions in the game. And finally the puzzling is a fun mechanic that can keep a player engaged during their turns and offers a spatial element to the strategy and decision making that really helps this game stand out.

UPDATE: After a dozen plays, safe to say this is a 10. I continue to want to play constantly and simply love it. It's one of the best solo games ever. Multiplayer is still extremely enjoyable and tense. I'm a huge fan and hope to get plenty more chances to play this.

A heavy euro that includes Patchwork as a mini game. Not as punishing to feed your people as some of Uwes other games but I like it that way.

I like this game very much. At first it was very daunting: the countless options during your turns are very intimidating, I remember the look of my girlfriend when I started to go through the different options during the teaching of the rules. But after 2-3 games something clicked...
The good bits: 
- in spite of the countless options there is still interaction between the players, since there is always 2-3 action spaces, which both players wants. 
- The steep but gratifying learning curve: it is good to watch your final results to increase from game to game. In your first game you look at your board in utter desperation, fearing the end game scoring. Later you start to take more and more risk. 
- the puzzling: The tetris-like part of this game is fantastic! There is a point when you start putting together the different special tiles 'in your head' only, not needing to physical components anymore. That's good!
- The thriving solo community on BGG: There is an ongoing solo-chalange series here on BGG keeping the solo game fresh. 
- The game use dice with the perfect amount of luck mitigation. If you are prepared, you very rarely miss at the actions where a dice roll is needed. And even if you miss, you get something in return. And it is pretty thematic anyway: pillaging/hunting/whaling was (and still is) partially luck based.
The BAD: 
- The occupation cards: there are weightless as in the rules. We started to use the 'draw 2/keep 1' variant, since with the original rules the card draw could be very ad hoc. Even so, don't expect a deck so fundamental to the game, as in Agricola.
- Without the Island mini expansion there are not enough variety, especially with the fact the Feroe-Island is so much weaker than the rest.

April 2017:  Terrific game.  I've got 9 plays in (which is pretty good for such a long game) and still love it.  The first 3 people I taught the game to each doubled my score in 2-player games.  Ouch!  But I still love it.  I might like Fields of Arle a little bit more... tough call.... but they're different enough that I want to keep them both.  Only concern I have about the game is that the pillaging seems a bit overpowered in the games I've played.

This is definately a game that take a learning game or two in order to know what you're doing or should be doing. There's a lot going on to think about and keep track of. In that way, you are free to take lots of different paths. However, you are very limited in the actions needed to try to do well in this game. I got blocked out of a spot out of nowhere and it really put me behind. I was so caught up in trying to fill my board and get better income that I forgot to see what was generating me any positive points. This is going to need some more plays before I can truly judge it... I just hope that there are opportunities to do that

RATING: 4
At it's heart, A Feast for Odin is an abstract puzzle game with a lightly painted on viking veneer (you are covering your ground with coats, rocks, money... what?). It's overwrought, overlong, overwhelming, fiddly and a touch on the boring side- it's a wide open sandbox with very little tension. You get a little bit of engine building for trapping/whaling/raiding, and occupation cards give slight boosts, but overall the game felt relatively flat and lacked a sense of progression. 

Rosenberg hits you over the side of the head with a mountain of rules for a game that is simply about getting shaped items to fit well on a board in a multiplayer solitaire package. These types of games are fine- I like Princes of Florence, Patchwork, Blokus, Cottage Garden and even games like Agricola and Castles of Mad King Ludwig (which kind of fit into this "find a way to connect strange shapes on a board" idea). But AFFO is just not worth the effort for the rewards it provides. Add in a touch of point salad and some supremely annoying dice rolling mechanics and this game is firmly outside of my realm of enjoyment. 

It's a shame, because when I first heard about this game, I was excited to try it and I was really looking forward to my first (and possibly last) play of it. Before playing, I was told that a "good" score in this game is 100 points, and I scored ~90 in my first game. I'm 90% sure the game isn't worth the effort of exploring to find enough corners to cut to get me those last ten points for a "good" score.

This game is solidly in the "Not so good - but could play again" zone of the BGG rating scale, thus my rating. I don't see ever owning it, seeking it out to play, and can definitely envision refusing a game of it.  Another miss by Rosenberg for me.

I was skeptical of the overwhelming list of actions,but I found them pretty easy to internalize after a few turns.  I was also worried there would be isolated paths to victory that amounted to several disconnected sub-games, but I found that the sub-strategies intertwined and reused common elements in an interesting way.  I was worried the granularity would be too fine and the pace too slow, but I found that strategic cohesion emerges from the vast expanse quite quickly.

In the end, I quite enjoyed the game, although I do not relish the thought of teaching it to others.

update:  the starting role cards (esp. A deck) are not well balanced at all, but that can be fixed with a draw-3-keep-1 setup rule.

update:  emigration is really good.  Not broken but it's so good that it does seem to narrow the strategic options.  Still a good game.

Game is actually a lot simpler than it looks.  It's just a normal worker placement game with an element of puzzle solving.  It feels simpler than Uwe's previous heavy Euros.  There's many different paths to victory so you don't end up competing with others much even in a 4 player game.  Even though the puzzle part can be annoying at times, it can also be very addicting as you try to fit all the pieces in exactly the right positions.  I wanted to play again as soon as I finished my first game and that is a good sign!!

After several plays I've decided that I do not like the Tetris puzzle element of this game. I like the worker placement, the occupations, dice rolling for hunting and whaling, and the raiding and pillaging. But I just can't abide the competitive jigsaw puzzling that is central to this game. That is just not fun to me.

I can see how this appeals to many, just not to me. An extremely elegant yet thematic mishmash of (most) mechanics. It's really multiplayer solitaire, but in this instance I consider it a plays since you can often play independent of each other to avoid downtime.

However, the game lacks a heart. I strongly dislike the puzzling, and thematically, this is absurd. Really, Tetris?? Neither am I fond of the professions.

A feast for worker placement fans! Really, there are so many possibilities to place your viking meeples ... it's a pleasure. And therefore the players have a lot of possible strategies to strive after. A mass of high quality components and the typical Rosenberg apprenticeships (like in "Agricola") make this game a very good one. And for a classical Euro the theme is more present than I thought.

Certainly a head-spinner, with plenty of opportunities for brain-melt, right up to and including the final score-counting. Feels like the balance between all paths available from the start and opportunity and choice from card draw gives the game a decent variety of paths to victory. Inclusion of dice seems like a sensible choice rather than a  - thematically suits the actions they resolve, and there  plenty of ways to mitigate for the chance-averse. Two thumbs up, plus two-and-a-half migraine stars.

This is my favorite big Uwe game so far. There are a lot of different strategies to explore, and it scales well. I've enjoyed it with 1-4. The main thing that concerns me so far is how the islands work. Two of the islands in particular are very good to get early, but you can't reliably wait for the other islands to flip because people may take them all. I'm not sure if having an island is necessary to doing well. If it is necessary, then that may become a problem at higher player counts.

Flipping the ships is crazy powerful, maybe OP, because it's huge VP AND it feeds your family. The occupations are varied and plenty of them, but you only start with 1 and somewhat randomly get a tiny handful more during the game, 1 at a time, so they are kinda pointless.

I really liked the the puzzle aspect as well as the concept of upgrading loot.  The theme works pretty well too.

I did not like that the different occupations (which come to you randomly) seemed to  have such a wide difference in utility especially in regard to when during the game they would be useful (at the beginning of the game, mid-game or not until the very end for scoring).

But my biggest problem was that there was so little player interaction.  I never didn't have a good place to place my workers and I didn't ever see a good opportunity for blocking.

I'm glad I got a chance to try this before I tried to hunt it down, because I'm not sure how much it would get played. The whole Tetris-like aspect of the main board is gimmicky, but interesting, and the big action board made it feel like a heavier Fields Of Arle. Plus, punching out all the little bits of cardboard would probably drive me crazy. So, I'd play it if someone offered, but it's probably not something I'm rushing to own.

Rosenberg has jumped the shark with this one.  It is so complex that the mechanics create a disconnect with the theme, takes too long to teach, and is not as fun as his previous games.  Art is not as good as previous games either.  I usually like Tetris-style puzzles, but it is more frustrating than fun in this game.  Feast for Odin is not a classic, and it is barely a good game.  Even the viking theme cannot save this one for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Simply the best! Better than all the rest! 

This is surely Uwe Rosenberg's magnum opus. It's also the best game of 2016.

Players take control of a clan of vikings to loot, pillage, hunt, sail, trade, build, explore, and everything else vikings do.

There are 61 worker-placement options in this game. SIXTY-ONE! 63 in a 4 player game. This should make the game a horrible slog as players try to figure out, and memorise, all the actions they can take, but "A Feast For Odin" is so brilliantly realized that that isn't the case. There are 'groups' of actions, so you need only know what the group does, each subsequent action within the group is 'better' but also requires more workers. It's a great balancing act, as some actions are identical, but cost more workers, so it tempts players to use the cheaper actions early before they're taken by someone else.

With so many action spots, and those actions costing 1 - 4 vikings, and each player having only 12 vikings, you may think there's no tension, that each player just does what they want to do without anyone getting in the way. Not the case. Even in a 2 player game you will be butting heads over the actions you want to take.

The spacial element in this game is also fantastic. Filling your player board feels good, and doing so can lead to permanent bonuses that will allow you to fill spots even faster.

There are so many paths to victory. Livestock is worth points from the outset, then they breed and lead to more points, and more livestock, without the need for you to do anything! And you can trade them for some of the best goods in the game. 

Or maybe you want to explore. Those extra boards are a great way to gain fast income and more permanent bonuses.

Perhaps you're not a happy clan of vikings and emigration seems appealing. It's not only worth points but it also cuts down on the amount of food you'll need to feed your clan at the end of the round. (Yes, you need to feed your people, this is an Uwe Rosenberg game after all)

And there's more...

My only complaint: the dice. Dice add randomness, not something you want in this sort of heavy euro-game. A lot has gone into mitigating that randomness. Each action that requires a die roll allows you to roll multiple times. You can then spend resources to adjust the roll. There's even an entire deck of cards exclusively used to further adjust the die rolls. All of this just makes me wonder why they're even here.

Really, I can't say enough good things about "A Feast for Odin." It's a deep, complex game with more strategies and more tactical play than I've seen in a long time. And it does all that it does in an incredibly short playtime (for this type of game). The box claims 30min/player and that seems quite accurate.

Uwe takes the puzzle building aspect of his 2p game Patchwork, ramps it up a few notches, and mashes it up with the resource mgmt / worker placement of FoA (61 spots!) to create a unique gaming experience that once again ups his previous designs. He foregoes the constrained sandbox by adding in 200+ occupation cards and introduces a fun pillaging / hunting mechanism with die rolling! It's a hard one to wrap your head around in the beginning and you have to dig yourself out of a huge hole (-86 pts to start). But if you are patient, you will soon realize it is not complex and super rewarding. All in all, a must for Uwe fans.

A firm favourite this Uwe opus is a regular pick for my wife and I. Whilst it does play like quite the side by side solitaire, there's also a surprising amount of interaction with us often vying for the same worker placement slots. We haven't played many but it's our favourite Uwe pick.

Uwe is back! This is a really great title that while retaining the feel of an Uwe, it has some fresh and original mechanics. Certainly there is a harvest, although you just get stuff instead of needing to feeding your guys, and you typically have plenty of food to go around. There's also a bunch of bits, and goods that you can upgrade (although disappointingly they are not really tied much to each other). The occupation cards provide a bunch of variety, and the powerful actions which require a bunch of viking workers give you a bonus of getting or using those occupations. The occupations give you a goal to employ something to be able to use them, and I like having something to shoot for. On top of that, you're playing this really fun Tetris-like game on your board, working to get bonuses and increase your income. As you get additional workers each round, you automatically are able to do more things, but as the variety of actions is so large, there's a bunch of ways to go. As you can tell, I really enjoyed this, and look forward to playing it again!

I'm a huge fan of heavy Euros but really didn't rate this game and probably wouldn't play again. I understood how to play it, I just thought that having so many worker placement options meant there wasn't the usual fun / pain of blocking / being blocked as there were just so many places to go. Rather than being a brain burner over which strategy to follow and what to do, I felt there were so many options that it didn't really matter too much. I ended up coming second (by one point) against 3 other experienced players. That shouldn't really be the case in a "heavy" Euro.

The game setup looks daunting, with it's 40(?) types of goods, 80+ action options, and a bunch of assorted bits. Listening to the rules, I wasn't expecting to really get it, or even necessarily enjoy it very much. Fortunately, though, it's actually not complicated at all (rules wise): 
- there are a bunch of goods that come as tiles of various sizes. For each size, there are 4 levels: orange < red < green < blue. O/R are mostly used as food (periodic feedings required as in Agricola or Le Havre) while G/B are mostly used to cover stuff up >A2, for example).
- It's a worker-placement/action selection game. You start with 6, and get an extra each round. The action table is in 4 columns, for 1-4 workers.

All in all, it's a well-organized system that's easy to understand once you know the game. But it looks like an absolute mess! I enjoyed it, though, and more than I did my one play of Fields of Arle (with which it shares some things: e.g., board layout, tile use mechanism).

Agriculture, worker placement, and Tetris.  All things Uwe Rosenberg seems to love.  This game combines all of it.

There's a lot of nuance and options in this game to explain it all in a short comments sections but the main crux of the game is placing workers to do various actions, many of which grant you different colored goods of different shapes and sizes.  You use these shapes to fill in spaces on your player board which grant you resource bonuses, income, and even points.  Or more accurately negates negative points.

There is so much here and so many options.  In our first game some weren't even touched.  Nobody explored any of the additional location boards for example.  I absolutely adore games like this, Uwe Rosenberg is my favorite designer after all.

I think my favorite feature of games like this is the combination of depth of choice and endless replayability.  Not only are there just tons of options but there is also a card mechanic where you can play occupation cards for special abilities and bonuses.

There is almost nothing I can fault this game for, I think it does everything so right.

I loved the 60+ action choices. They are overwhelming at first, but within the action categories they are rather similar so it's easy to learn. The tile placement reminded me of the game Patchwork, but more stressful as you are filling a bigger space, and there are placement rules. The player aid was great to help remind you of the order of each round.

Overall, I really wanted to like this, but I just found it too fiddly to enjoy. I also was disappointed with the occupation cards. They can be a little too random at times.

First impressions: glorious multiplayer-solitaire sandbox mess. Patchwork crossed with Greenland (!)?

Worker placement game where players deploy workers to approximately 200 different action spaces to, broadly speaking, collect different shaped goods tiles. Some of these can be eaten; better ones can be placed to fill up players' home boards or other new lands acquired. Covering or surrounding specific spaces increases income, and most are worth negative points if not covered.

This all has to be vague because there are so many options. You can pick up cows and sheep, which breed (another space causes cows to give milk); you can go hunting or trapping or whaling. You can trade. You can take up smithing; you can raid for treasures.

Despite all this, it's actually a fairly simple game. There are some confusing special cases but it's generally very smooth. Special cards seem quite a mixed bunch and there are so many that, late in the game, you might be lucky to draw one that matches your strategy.

The only major concern is that it is quite a solitary affair. Interaction is exclusively in the form of competition for shared resources and action spaces, but many actions do not require resources at all and there are so many that there is usually a non-useless option available. The extent to which other players' interference is worth the increase in downtime is questionable.

If you have to play a multiplayer-solitaire optimization puzzle, though, then it's a great one. One of the best games of 2016.

I'm not super excited about the Patchwork-esque pattern building, but that is just personal preference.  If you like that stuff a lot, you should get this game.  I'd rather play Caverna or Ora et Labora, so I'll stick with those.

Uwe's newest game is a three-way-mix of Agricola, Caverna and Patchwork. As in Agricola the zillions of occupation cards are providing variable game play, but they are not as influential as in Agricola. The action spaces are plenty (like in Caverna). I like how the value of the spaces is demanding different numbers of Vikings to be placed. And finally, the puzzling aspect from Patchwork (or Tetris) is simply a stroke of genius. It brings a lot of variability to each game, especially with the 8 islands that can be explored in addition to your homeland. The puzzling also serves another very important (!!!) cause - it gives you something (a lot!) to do while you are waiting for the other players to finish their turn, so downtime is not an issue in this game.

Played several times solo and once with three players. I love it!

I own Agricola, Le Havre, Fields of Arle and Agricola: acbas and Uwe designs great games.

This one is really good! Played recently three games solo in two days and don't get tired of it.

Edit: Played several times more with different player counts. Still not tired!

Edit: Right now I prefer Agricola and Caverna (which is new to me).

This game just has way to many actions. and I like a meaty game but there is soooo much to keep up with and then you have 50 some odd actions you can take ..... I could never put a cognizant plan together to move forward.  I felt that I was just lurching from one minor vp collection to the next vp collection turn by turn.  just to much.  I will play it if offered but I will not be putting this one into the collection

RATING: 8.8
Very interesting worker placement game.  It is a huge game where you won't do everything in each game (there's like 60 different actions you can take!).  Because of that it's a bit sandboxy.  You can choose whether you want to trade with overseas people or pillage and plunder them!  You can choose whether you want to build longhouses to store your food goods or sheds to store wood and ore.

There are so many choices that they can be quite overwhelming, particularly in your first game.

The goal of the game is to cover your board with plunder, loot and all sorts of pretty things (the prettiest being the English crown).  Along the way you may choose to breed animals, send out raiding parties, explore new islands or go whaling.

In all it's a fantastic thematic Euro which isn't for everyone but is great at what it tries to be.  If you like worker placements but don't like the food pressure of Agricola or the randomness in Lords of Waterdeep then this one might be for you.

If you have a lot of analysis paralysis in your group, skip this one.

A bit scary for new players (too many worker-placement options), but a solid game after one or two plays.  IMO, needs one house rule - draw two occupations and keep one.  As with other Rosenberg games, turn order determination can "bite you" sometimes.

RATING: 7.25
Very interesting worker placement game with a TON going on. I like it, but feel like sometimes there is just too much going on and it is hard to optimize or make a strong plan. Instead you kind of just have to "go for it" and use your instincts on what to do and how to differentiate yourself from other players.

My biggest problem, outside of optimization difficulty, is the imbalanced cards. I feel like some of the random cards, especially those that give you special powers, are insanely strong if activated early and focused on. They are few and far between, but I definitely feel some cards are way over the top. Outside of that and a few other dominant strategies that seem to crop up (like certain islands being better and certain strategies being more optimal) the game is still very interesting and fun. I'm not a huge fan of "spatial relationship" placement games, but it works here. Also, the randomness with dice rolling can be a bit much at times, but it seems to balance out in the long run.

My other biggest complaint is how fiddle some of the rules are. Like some things can be crafted with metal (if they have the tongs) and others can't be. Okay, that's minor. But then you can buy ships for their basic price. Or you keep traps you use when hunting, but lose other weapons, and gain 1 wood and 1 weapon if you fail, and possibly your worker. And then that whole feeding system with the auto gain of food feels like a hotfix patch that was added and doesn't flow with the rest of the game.

However, this game still makes me never want to play Caverna again, although I still very much enjoy Agriola with the expansion because it has a very different feel.

RATING: 8
For right now, it doesn't beat out Caverna for me.  I do need to play it more, and would like to soon.  My current view has Agricola as tight, Caverna as loose, and Feast super loose.  I like the middle version.  Has just enough of everything for me.

RATING: 8
This game is large and imposing at first. But don't let that scare you.

Yes, there are a ton of parts, tiles, and 75 different actions you can take and more player boards you might acquire during gameplay.  But the game really does move along once you know what you are doing. 

I really love the Tetris style game mechanic that requires you to fit odd shaped tiles together, and when you run out of room you can get more islands and building to place tiles in.

The rest is pretty much a better version of Agricola.  And with so many actions there is very little restriction of activity. While there are some more desirable moves to make, there is usually two or three versions, and plenty of room for redirecting efforts elsewhere.  

I just wish the price point was more reasonable.

Looks like a point salad puzzle game, layered with the standard worker placement, resource gathering, resource into another resource into victory points engine mitigated by a 'feeding' mechanic with theme only to be seen by a binocular. So basically it has everything you need, right?

The fact that there are a huge number of actions doesn't make a game better. The fact that there are gamy mechanics doesn't help either. The fact that the board initially looks like a boring spreadsheet... again. 

It might be very deep, but is it entertaining while doing so? I get the feeling I'd be rather playing Dominant Species when playing a 'hefty' euro. Or Terra Mystica. Or Robinson Crusoe. Or Agricola (on which this game obviously based a lot of mechanics). All of these possess more theme. But, you might say, replayability! Oh yeah, sure we need those in a marketplace CROWDED with good games. And Agricola offers as much replayability as you need, while being a whole lot more accessible.

But, you might say, I LIKE having choices and options. Well, ANY good Euro will offer those. With a lot less learning curve, more attractive art and maybe *gasp* even some theme shining through.

But, you might say, Uwe Rosenberg! Agricola, Le Havre, Caverna! Ah yes, all these games possess quite similar mechanics and each new game just has more of the old. Good games for those who like the genre but please do pick one and stick with that game. And if you have one of these, why bother to get more carton and meeples to get another euro choice resource into resource into victory points game. And if you miss the puzzle aspect, get his Patchwork instead.

Finally, if this game was costed about â¬40, which is a reasonable price for a Euro carton with standard meeples only game, it might be something worth considering if you don't care about theme and don't already possess Caverna, Castles of Burgundy, Caylus, Le Havre or other Euro gather resource style games. Because, yes, this one has huge replayability.

But I wonder why they dared to put a â¬100 price tag on it. To make the game scarce, hence desirable, hence driving up the rating? After all, if you chuck out 100 bucks for a game, you won't give it a bad rating now, do you... or is it just the first signs of the Asmodee giant now possessing almost all major boardgame companies and being able to ask any price they want, thus driving up prices across the whole market?

Blegh. Pass, pass and triple pass. Don't believe the hype and laugh at those who purchased this one. Priced like a new car, you'll hear the money fly away as soon as you start driving it. I just wonder how steep the decline in price on the second hand market will be on this one.

I dont like the puzzle part of the game, putting down green and blue tiles on the board to cover up the negative points. It slows down the game a lot if you want to optimize your play without adding any interesting mechanics into the game.

To sum it up I can say that it was a fun game, but I would rather play caverna.

RATING: 8
Could be a 10 if not for the (imo unnecessary) luck elements related to the dice.  yes, I know, you can mitigate, but this game is soooo much about efficiency, and having to lose important resources or plan to go out of your way to be able to mitigate bad luck is frustrating, and STILL you can fail, which despite what others may say, I find to be a substantial setback in a game that plays so tightly (if you're really trying to do well).  I've had games where the dice really screwed me over the course of the game, and overall I believe it cost me at least several points, perhaps as much as 10 in one game where repeatedly I kept rolling 7 and 8 on hunting and trapping, so despite having 2-3 bows and 3-4 wood, I still was unable to meet my goal.  Also, I've heard it said that you can simply skip all spots that require any die roll.  I think 1) that sounds feasible, but really, it isn't, as the actions seem integral to multiple different aspects of the game and 2) that sounds like an excuse for poor design.

Still, that's a long rant about what I do not like about the game, but it still scores a very rare 9 from me, so I think the game reaches "great" status.  It's quite possibly the best solo game I've ever played as well, which is something I almost never even consider in any game.

tl;dr: it's an Uwe game!

Ever since [thing=31260][/thing] [person=10][/person] has been cranking out heavy big box after heavy big box. And they go from very good to excellent. So many people look forward to every new game and of course I always put them on my 'to try' list. I don't always buy them right away though. [thing=102794][/thing] I didn't get because it was based on Agricola (which I like a lot, but hardly ever play) and was very expensive. This year though I did take a chance on his new effort for some reason, but only after Asmodee was pressured into offering it at an acceptable price.
I must say I'm glad I took the chance. The amount of bits and action spaces looks daunting. But once all rules are explained, and you've played 2 rounds, everything falls into place very nicely. You can't remember what actions are available, but you can easily remember what type of actions are available and since they are grouped by type, it's easy to find an action that will work for your strategy. The question then becomes how to combine those in the most efficient way and how to deal with other people doing the actions you want to do.
Thematically I don't really get how covering up shapes on a board with resources adds up to having a feast for a deity, but that's something that doesn't bother me.
I haven't played [thing=163412][/thing], so all of this was refreshing, but also familiar at the same time. You can certainly feel the Uwe DNA.

You can't cover up the fact that you are rehasing old designs by adding more and more stuff.

I'm a fan of many of Uwe Rosenberg's recent designs (including Le Havre, Caverna and Fields of Arle), and I am a certified Agricola groupie. A Feast for Odin has much of that same depth and complexity, but unfortunately it's encumbered by some elements that make this a rare miss for me. Specifically, the lack of player interaction (although Caverna has this, as well), the fiddliness of covering the play boards (an aspect of Ora et Labora I don't love, as well) and the needless introduction of the randomness of dice into a deep strategy game all contribute to making Feast a lesser star in the Rosenberg constellation for me.

I can tell you this game is amazing after only 2 plays.  I'll admit, its overwhelming your first play.  Teaching this game is borderline terrible.  Not due to the complexity, but the sheer number of options available to you.  You can't begin to attempt to explain all the options to new players.  So you just explain a few along with the general concept of the game.  Its a difficult task, but once you get through that first play, its well worth it.

Too early to tell, but this may replace Agricola is my favorite Rosenberg.  Not sure yet.  But I do love it.

I love the different options. You can focus on emigrating, exploring, whaling, raiding/plundering.  The balance between laying tiles on your board vs. keeping them available to upgrade creates great decision points.  I also love the choice between income and bonuses, or both.  

With only two plays, I haven't messed around with occupation cards much.  That will come with experience.  But for now, I'm enjoying learning this game.

RATING: 8
First play impression: Yes there are over 60 action spaces. Yes this is the most literal "spreadsheet game" that has ever been made. Yes this game looks like a practical joke on euro gamers. But it's good.

Considering the above, this game is not as daunting as one might think. The action spaces are mostly similar so despite there being dozens of spaces, they're not that difficult to understand. Most of them give you resources, let you convert resources, or let you upgrade your tiles.

On the subject of A Feast for Odin versus Caverna, so far I like Caverna more. Caverna has a nicer look to it and the paths to victory feel more varied in Caverna. Sure there are many different paths to take in AFfO, but you eventually need to be covering up your board as much as possible so it will feel similar each time. In Caverna you can pursue wildly different paths throughout the whole game.

But AFfO is still good on its own. Despite the monolithic look of the giant box and the tons of pieces, it feels like it will play in about the same amount of time as Agricola or Caverna, especially with more experience. It's still a good efficiency challenge and I'm eager to play again.

I actually enjoyed it, but a couple people at the table seemed ready to kill themselves by the time it was over.

It definitely is a super sandbox Uwe game, where you can legitimately take your vikings and do whatever the hell your want.

I do feel like the game has so much width to it that players will start to setup their best combos and just keep spamming them which isn't the greatest thing but that's a small complaint.

I personally prefer the tightness of an Argicola over this, but I would like to play it again.

The only real problem with this game is the huge table space it requires and the fact that some actions spaces are rarely used/inefficient.

The first play was daunting, with the sheer number of available actions. However, after a full play I feel very comfortable with the game.

I'm excited to try out new and different strategies in the future!

I really enjoy this game.
And for me it's strange cause i usually don't like too much abstraction, even in an eurogame.
But i find the puzzle part just enjoyable, fun and satisfactory.
The rest is a pretty interesting worker placement, with lots of things to do, different paths to take and decisions to make, and how to deal with your puzzle.
Little game design flaw in my opinion, the draw of the cards. There are a lot of those, and you just draw once each time. Sometimes you draw something that is just perfect for you, sometimes you will just play it for the couple points it gives.
Sidenote: one of the few eurogame that i enjoy also in soloplay. Probably cause of the puzzle-thing.

This is the best solo game I have played to date. This is definitely Uwe's Magnum Opus and will get even better with the planned expansions. Extra islands for exploration will really open up the 3-4 player games, IMHO. 
I find the game surprisingly thematic for a game that looks decidedly abstract on first glance.  A lot of work and research has gone into this game and it shows. 
I can say with confidence that if I could only own one game, this would be it. 
Only negatives would be the occupation cards but some house rules can help with that somewhat. I also suppose the price could be construed as a negative but there are a lot of components and years of refinement to pay for. 
This game is a 9.9 for me. Just a wonderful gaming experience. :)

RATING: 7
A Feast for Odin is the latest Uwe Rosenberg game and I really wanted to try this. The game has a ton of stuff and is likely to be expensive, so I really wanted to know how much I liked it before trying to get a copy.

Like most Uwe games, you're gathering resources and trying to feed your people. In this game, feeding isn't really that tough. There's harvests that flat out give you a bunch of food. There's a couple of wonky spatial aspects to this game. The first is feeding. You can only feed your people red and orange colored tiles. And you can't have orange tiles bordering other orange tiles. Additionally, the second tile of a color must be rotated 90 degrees. You're trying to fill a width, so it can be painful to have two very wide but shallow tiles, as the second won't be nearly as effective. But there are lots of ways to get food, and you can always supplement it with coins.

Orange goods can be upgraded into red which can be upgraded into green which can be upgraded into blue. Blue and green goods can be used to fill spaces on your player board. You can't place green tiles adjacent to other green tiles though. This is the second spatial element of the game as your player board has income spaces, special bonus spaces and tons of negative point spaces. You want to build all the spaces to the left and below an income marker so that you get that much income. You also want to surround but not cover the special bonus spaces as you'll get that bonus every round. And towards the end of the game you'll want to cover as many negative marker spaces as possible.

You start with a handful of dudes and every round you get one extra (which must be fed). But there's no "make a baby" space in this game, so growth just happens. There are 22 action spaces. They're broken into about 6 or 7 action types with separate spaces that each require either one, two, three or four workers. The spaces that require more workers tend to be a little cooler. Playing on a three worker space gets you an occupation card draw and playing on a four worker space lets you play an occupation card.

There's a couple of actions in the game that require dice. Hunting/whaling and Raiding. Hunting/whaling require a six sided die and you're trying to roll low. Raiding requires a 12 sided die and you're trying to roll high. If you fail you get consolation prizes, so failing isn't so bad.

Ships are required to do a couple of actions in the game and they're worth points. You can also "emigrate" by converting a medium or large ship into mega-points, which also decreases how much you need to feed. It costs more later in the game.

Most of the actions in the game involve getting resources, getting tiles of a particular color, upgrading colored tiles to better colors, etc. There's several extra player boards you can acquire that allow you to get more income and/or special bonuses if you fill them up.

The game has a lot of actions and my first play was mostly spent just trying to learn "how to play". My next play will probably focus on "how you should play"

I did like this game a lot, but unfortunately, I don't think my groups have as much enthusiasm for this type of game. I don't think it would get played often enough to justify the price tag.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Currently my number 1 favorite game. The variety of viable strategies, the fresh mechanics, the emphasis on flexibility and the extremely well integrated theme make this the ultimate worker placement style strategy game. Though the board looks intimidating, the basic mechanics are actually quite lean and intuitive, but Uwe has figured out how to maximize the different ways to apply and combine these mechanics creating an incredibly large range of possibilities. Over 40 plays and it still feels as fresh and deep as ever. Immensely replayable, even in solitaire. Do not be intimidated by the amount of pieces; fans of Agricola, Terra Mystica, Puerto Rico or the like will pick this up with ease.

If you are a fan of high strategy and a sucker for seamlessly integrated theme, do yourself a favor and dive into the world of Vikings with A Feast for Odin!

A Feast for Odin manages to expand on the ideas of previous Uwe Rosenberg games while keeping its mechanics tight and elegant.

The games rules are so well presented that we needed to consult the (hefty) rule book only two or three times for clarification after the initial read through.

A few rules come close to feeling janky (treasure placement and feast rules, dice rolling on hunts and raids (!)), but honestly they wind up being well motivated in the end and add to the game.  

Rumors of 30-minutes per player playing time are complete garbage unless you have very fast/disciplined players. I'd schedule at least an hour per player if you're playing casually and without a clock.

If you enjoy Agricola/Caverna/Le Havre and are up for playing a little Tetris on the side, this is for you.

This is a strange one for me. I recognize (and even agree with) many of the complaints I've heard about this game, but they somehow don't prevent me from enjoying each play. It's much more sandboxy that many of Rosenberg's games and I find it less stressful. It is somewhat less interactive due to the multitude of action spaces.

First impression after two plays: a bit dry but a lot to discover. The theme doesnât feel as well implemented as in Fields of Arle. It takes a while before itâs clear which actions are available, and what they exactly do. Pretty streamlined though, well designed. 

Preliminary rating 8, might go up after few more plays.

Rating after first play, it may go up with more plays. 

While it wasn't a tough game to learn, and moderately easy to teach (in a reasonable timeframe), there are so many actions and strategies to consider that it was not an easy first play. Like with Uwe's other games I've played, more plays will present various strategies to explore, and it certainly isn't a complaint. I expected to be lost on the first play or two. 

2 player was great, I have a feeling 3 player may be the sweet spot.

RATING: 6.5
There is A LOT  going on in this game...the available actions board is a bit overwhelming...even upon completion of a game, I never got close to performing all of the available actions.  I really do like the Patchwork tie-in of having to fill up you various player boards and overall the game is less complex than it initially seems.  The greater complexity seems to be related to upgrading your various goods.   Regardless it's a game that I will never play enough to optimize my strategy, but I was impressed that even with 7round 3P game  we were able to finish in ~2hrs.  I'd play it again, but even though it has a ton of replayability...it's not a game that I need to own or would want to play all of the time.

A good solid worker placement game with easy rules when someone teaches them. Learning from rulebook I would deem a lot harder, as is typical also for other Uwe games. Overall clearly better than Caverna but falls short of Agricola in my opinion.
The patching mechanism is very nice and the game lets you choose from a wide range of strategies which all seem to be viable to some extent. A lot of cardboard in a big box but the table footprint was surprisingly small in a good way. The only downside for me is that this is perhaps too much of a point-salad game, a type of game I hate in general. However, there are many far worse in that area. It also suffers from major downtime from time to time and causes severe analysis paralysis several times in a game. The decision-space is just too wide with nearly 50 action spaces to pick from of which 10 clearly could serve you well and to top that every action outcome is clearly calculable or fairly predictable with the push your luck actions. This causes an urge to evaluate all options or play suboptimally, which causes either a bad feeling of doing bad moves or a bad feeling of overanalysing. A little bit more opaqueness wouldn't hurt in order to reduce this. Also it felt like the amount of different resource types could have been reduced, thus streamlining the game but still providing the same experience.

This my favorite Uwe Rosenberg game for solo play and hence my favorite game by him overall. There's a lot of different ways to play and just enough randomness to keep it from being a completely static puzzle (unlike some of his other games) without adding outright luck.

Much better on 2nd play. Spatial puzzle with groups of dudes used for action selection. Economy of action plus puzzle element make this different enough from Uwe's other games to be interesting. Feeding is still a thing but it is much more deemphasized. Note to self: remember to upgrade your cows and sheep to fill negative points on personal boards. 

Edit: very good at two. There is still enough blocking for actions and there is much less downtime. I'd say the sweet spot for player count in this game is 2 or 3. Too much downtime at 4, especially with new players.

Wow, this is one of the most boring games I have played in recent memory; whatever mild interest the spatial puzzle holds is dwarfed by the banality of resource collection and conversion. Feast for Odin is an unrepentant sandbox game with almost no tension or interaction; the amount of fiddling with chits is outrageous- so much process and so little interaction or drama. I tried giving this a few chances but liked it less with subsequent plays.

Only played 2 player games so far but am enjoying learning and becoming better at the game. I seem to enjoy for sandbox type games where all the choices are laid out for you with a the edges of the sandbox being where other players play.  Some interesting decisions near the end if you finish your board early and need things to do with your leftover tiles and resources because they essentially end up being worth nothing at the end of the game. The occupation cards add an interesting element but they also can give someone a big advantage if they pick up the right combos.

No, seems interesting but a lot going on. I'm a big fan of the Harvest games and Patchwork but I'm not certain yet about the integration of the spatial element of placing your goods in this kind of larger game. It may just be a bit too much going on in this one but I look forward to getting more plays to find out.

RATING: 8
A Feast for Odin is an absolutely gigantic game. It's sort of an obvious next step for Uwe Rosenberg, whose designs over the last few years have felt more iterative than original. This one takes a massive action board (something like 60 worker spaces) to give it the scope of Fields of Arle and combines it with the Tetris puzzles he has been playing with in Patchwork and Cottage garden.

It's a weird combination, but it works. There is also a strange bit of alchemy happening with the resource conversions. It's no longer a logical conversion, i.e. cows to meat and leather, leather to clothing. Now you turn flax into coats, which turn into racks of ribs which turn into crowns. It's weird, but I will say it is almost easier to follow since the upgrade paths are now dictated by tile size and color. The game even comes with some nice plastic trays that keep everything sorted and more importantly, hold everything in the order it upgrades, so you don't really have to remember the exact paths.

The rest of the game feels very thematic. Vikings are constantly having to hunt to stave off starvation. Others are building boats and sailing out to conquer new lands. Still others just settle down and start raising livestock for more reliable food or to trade up for treasure instead of stealing it. All of it is a viable point scoring endeavor and all of it feels appropriate for a Viking game.

It feels similar enough to previous games that I think fans of Rosenberg will find it right in their wheelhouse, while the more ambivalent may find that this adds just enough interesting new stuff to the formula to be worth checking out. Now, if they could just get it back in print.

RATING: 5
Players are Vikings and the game promises raids, exploration, and financial pursuits.  All to be delivered via a huge smorgasbord of choices and a wealth of bits.  Many ways to skin the cat for VP's, but ultimately the game involves acquiring puzzle pieces (i.e. "goods") to cover one's "map" for income and VP's.  So much abstraction that there really is no theme whatsoever, only a pile of rules.  No new ground either, just an amplified number of choices and number of bits.  This one goes to 11, but it's the same old song.  The only player interaction is blocking of choices, but even that interaction is watered down by the wealth of available choices including the ability to choose previously chosen actions.  The result is that interaction between players is mostly of waiting for one another.  Steep learning curve, highly abstract, minimal interaction with much downtime adds up to a big feast of turkey.  A tryptophan dozer.

RATING: 8
I keep getting all these Uwe games, that all feel like branches from an ur-Agricola. Yet every one has been polished to near-perfection, and feels just different enough.

I think the Tetris aspect is a bit oversold; yes, there is some puzzling, but really it's the acquisition and conversion planning (Uwe's specialties) that matters most. A more intricate puzzle (perhaps silver as a 2-unit, and then the usual polyomino shapes) would've been a fascinating alternative version but probably too long/painful for most people.

The 61-space board is terrifying at first, but is about as clear as it could be after some familiarity. The 1/2/3/4 tradeoffs are really interesting, though I could wish the actions were a bit more uniform in strength (some are close to useless). I suspect scaling was optimized for 2, and I wonder if maybe 3p should use one of the 4p action clone boards.

One problem with all these solo-enabled games is that 90% of the chatter around them is for the solo game, which is very different. This is great solo, but I'm more interested in the multiplayer game, which unfortunately looks to be a real bitch to teach to anyone non-hardcore.

Love the unreal variety of occupation cards. Oddly, the "main" game (7 rounds) feels a little slack to me. It's so much easier to feast than in the short game that I miss some of that tension (and it contributes to useless action spaces).

It's a fun puzzle but luck of the draw, luck of rolling the dice and luck of the draw once again, no variable turn order, only start player? Seriously? In a game this long and strategic these things are just not okay.
Player interaction is basically zero, sometimes someone takes something you wanted, but since there is way too much stuff, it would take you a lot of time to know what other players might want, so all player interaction basically comes down to unpleasant surprises. So I feel that the only reason this game is a worker placement is because Rosenberg loves to make almost the same game over and over again.

Not a bad game, but there are too many things going on.
It took us half an hour to set up, one hour to explain and 3 hours of game, plus 15 minutes to tear down.
The 12 phases of a turn aren't difficult, they are all microthings to do, with the exception of the actions phase of course.
The "30 different resources" are actually one complex resource with levels and shape.
On the other hand, there are too many actions from which to choose and analysis paralysis is quite common.
It has some original points (or a good mesh of already seen mechanics) but the problem is the amount of information is not justified by the final sensation and experience.
I don't like at all the use of dice. So much strategy to build can be hindered by bad luck and i don't like it. At least I would have used dice with sides from 4 to 8, not from 1 to 12... or something like that... but no dice would be my choice.

Not likely to play it again but interesting experience.

I find the game interesting, but the action board is far too busy and makes play less smooth due to time wasted hunting for appropriate actions. It takes up a huge amount of table space as well. The custom wooden bits are great, but they also make the game box huge (and even so, it's hard to fit everything back inside when done). At least the token organizers that come with the game make setup less of a chore than it would have been otherwise.

Agricola and Caverna evolved and refined with a Viking theme with some pillaging.  My favorite aspect in this "reimplementation" is the pattern building player board puzzle to fill negative areas, gain income and activate bonuses.  I like the center stage action board neatly offering the group worker placement options and the challenge of mathing out the best value and use between similar choices. The resource tray of upgrade flippable resource tokens also serves as a 3D tech tree. First time I have seen converting bones to meal. Tiny fingers but it works ok.  It is multi solitaire but that isn't a great concern for us, it is still a group experience and satisfying to build our best economy.

Rating of 9.5 after only one play; instantly fell in love with this game. Way better than Caverna for me. Actions are clear and precise, but there's huge variety in the occupation cards (and we only used the A cards!) and lots of thinking with each move that you make in the game. Multiple ways to victory, no single game is ever the same it feels like. I have to get this game to my collection eventually.

EDIT 14/6/17; After 5 solo plays and 3 4p games, I can bump this into the 10 rating finally. Great solo game, great with 4p, haven't yet tried with 2-3p but I'm 100% they play equally great. Fantastic game and clearly in my Top 3.

I wasn't sure I'd take to this game. Repeated goods conversion isn't my favourite thing to do in games. But I find myself wanting to come back to it time and again. Perhaps it's the large number of options the game presents you with, giving the possibility to combine them in different ways to produce a different strategy from game to game. The Occupation cards certainly help there, although how they randomly enter the game can be a little frustrating at times, especially as later in the game, when you actually have enough vikings spare to regularly use the 3 and 4 Viking spaces (the ones that incidentally deal with Occupations), it's usually too late for those cards to be useful. The placement puzzle is compelling, with more decisions around it than just filling your board indiscriminately. There's also a nice feeling of progression and more than a little theme. And despite the myriad options, it plays relatively quickly after a couple of games to get through the learning curve.

The number of action spaces is totally overwhelming at the beginning of your first game, but really the "groups" are more important than the spaces themselves. By the end of your first game you'll have a decent idea of what each space does, and then it's just a matter of choosing the "strength" you want. It's nice they included the trays, but they do feel super cheap, so I'm not sure how they'll hold up long term. Overall, a pretty good game.

I [b]love[/b] how even allocating the stuff you collect is a hardcore tradeoff choice, trying to maximize income, bonus items, and covering negative point spaces. Hunting, raiding, and pillaging are suspenseful endeavors. Can you bring down that big beast? Catch that whale? No? Well, some of your guys will come home with wood they gathered and weapons they made in the downtime. â¦and that's just the start. Truly a phenomenal game, chock full of possibilities to explore, even if your opponents were to do the same thing every game (which hopefully they won't)!

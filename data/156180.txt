LIKE: Role selection and collecting eggs. Some of the roles are interesting. The scout card is very interesting.
DISLIKE: Some randomness in the card draws. Takes a play to understand the role cards.

OVERALL: Mildly entertaining. I wish the cards were even more swingy. It's fast, so it works, but I'd almost rather play Mission Red Planet, because those role cards are more extreme.

A reasonably fun, "one-two-three reveal" card game wherein everyone has the same set of cards, draws three, and chooses one.  Highest card, assuming no effects take precedence, gets first choice of booty, second highest gets second choice and so on.  A decent, quick filler that scratches the "one-two-three reveal" itch.

Likeable microgame. I had high -- probably unreasonably high -- expectations of it given the pedigree, but there's no percentage in downgrading a game for not meeting up to your wholly imaginary standards. It's a somewhat better game than Love Letter, with only a little more overhead, in roughly the same timespan. That's worth celebrating.

I was surprised by this little game, and it just may have the chops to stick around in my collection.  For a simple "blind bidding with special powers" game, it leads to some great emergent situations.  There's some mind games, but it doesn't bog down into deep deduction.  There's some elements of luck, just enough to lead to some wild outcomes, but you still have to make smart decisions.

Great filler!

A decent filler of hand management and second guessing what your opponents might play but since cards are random, counting cards is the only way to play smartly since you won't know exactly what your opponents can even do near the beginning. The spread of egg cards feels sort of like an auction mechanic with super powers.

Game is too light but drags itself on for three rounds needlessly.

Decent card components and cool art.

This was something like "Libertalia: the trick-taking game" with a bit of 6 nimmt mixed in.  Extraordinarily abstract with no connection whatsoever to the fantasy "theme" on the cards.  Fun enough game play I guess on a turn-to-turn basis, but the scoring was very clunky and the game just didn't feel fresh to me.  I think I have played 3-4 prototypes of still-unpublished games that feel very similar to this one, and this one doesn't have anything to recommend it more than any of those.  I may end up playing it again but only because my game group seemed to enjoy it more than me.  Maybe that's because they haven't played those other versions of it.

Basically a mash up of Love Letter and For Sale, I would say this is one of the more enjoyable microgame/diversion games I've played.  Pity about the name though, especially since it doesn't even have much to do with the game (seriously, what do empires have to do with it?).  Not that Love Letter is terribly descriptive, but at least it's catchy. Seriously, I can see the ridiculous name being an impediment to getting people to play.

Eggs and Empires is a blender of mechanics from a number of filler games. Flashes of Love Letter, Get Bit, Citadels, and particularly For Sale (and others I'm failing to mention) all meld together to make a very enjoyable light game.

While it is a game where luck can sometimes overshadow the ability to make a good decision, the psychology of choosing a role and seeing the results is almost always fascinating.

While playing multiple rounds with the pub rules variant can make this game outstay its welcome with large player counts, it is still one I recommend to those looking for a light game with a good balance of luck and tactics.

Everybody has the same 10 cards, numbered 1 to 10, with most having special powers as well. Players choose from their hand of 3 and simultaneously reveal, to determine who gets cards from the center (not everybody does and some are negative). There's all that, but it has an inherent "gang up on the leader" aspect that I generally don't like. It's okay I guess if you remember it's light and don't take it too seriously.

* Kickstarted! *

Card game played over three rounds, with the catch being that the winner of the point cards in each hand is not necessarily the highest value card because each card has its own ability to affect the game play. It's a combination of strategy and crazy luck to avoid being in the negatives. Worth a few plays as a starting, middle or ending game.

PLUS: inexpensive, different powers mean your win isn't guaranteed
MINUS: when someone is really ahead at the end of the second round there isn't much chance of catching up

FIRST IMPRESSION:

This wasn't a bad filler and plays quite quickly. Although the games are quite different, I would prefer this over Love Letter with the pub scoring rules as the game is faster. One tries to read their opponents and play cards accordingly to either try and take an egg or avoid taking an egg. Some character cards have special abilities to assist (or not) in this endeavor.

Right away I need to point out that while there are in fact eggs here, the game does not, in any way, deliver empires. There are plenty of other games which provide empires, so if that's the draw, you may wish to look elsewhere. For egg fans, you're in luck.

This is a sort of Love-Letterish game in which you have a hand of role cards numbered 1-10, each with some kind of power. Some eggs are revealed, good and bad (positive or negative points) and you want to take the good and not the bad. You choose eggs in numerical order, high-to-low, so you want to get first crack (har!) at them.

I played this two player, which is a slightly different setup, but the gist is the same. It's pleasant enough, and it's quick to learn and play, but there's a single element I think would make it better. As it is, you pretty much always want to be the high card, which is kind of boring. I think if you put the eggs out and had to take them in that order, where sometimes you want to be second or such, it would be much more tense and interesting. But as a light game, it's fine.

A light filler card game which has a Libertalia or Citadels feel to it.  Several Dragon eggs are put out with different positive and negative values on them.  Players have decks of 10 identical cards and a hand of three cards.  You play a card and acquire Dragon eggs based on the strength of your cards.  It is very easy and light.  Plays in a short amount of time, but is more family weight as card play can feel random.  I realize that if you are tracking the cards you have some knowledge of the best card to play.

Nice little game where everyone has an identical deck of ten characters, each with a power. Players play one card from their hand in hopes of getting the best egg (which are the source of victory points) or at least getting the lesser of whatever bad eggs are out. 
Nothing mindblowing, but it is a nice little filler. The artwork is great.

This was a Kickstarter purchased by a chum with the idea of bringing it along to our regular lunchtime games sessions with the idea that a game or two could be done in under thirty minutes or so. We played a six player game at the very same GLOG that SWI made its debut and I must say that it worked rather well and should certainly meet our needs for lunchtime gaming.

The basic idea is that everyone has ten cards valued from, wait for it, one to ten. Of this they will have three cards available for play each round. The game plays simply and cleanly, each turn every player plays one of their three available cards. The cards are played simultaneously and will determine who (and in what order) selects from the (usually) three ‘eggs’ on offer noting that some are negative. The round is resolved from the highest to lowest value card choosing from the ‘eggs’ remaining. The twist is that several cards have special powers which can either affect the order of choosing or negating other cards. If it’s a particularly bad selection of ‘eggs’ on offer players may fight to become last and not have to select an ‘egg’. After nine cards are played each player tallies up their ‘eggs’ and the person with the most points wins the round (and gets a token to prove it). The overall winner is the person who has won the most rounds (this varies depending on the number of players). 

Overall, this is a fun little game that should fit right in to our lunchtime games group. It’s not a game I’d like to play all day every day, but for what it is it’s perfectly suited for a shorter gaming session or as a ‘filler with a bit of substance’.

Eggs and Empires is kind of like a cross between Citadels and a micro game. Each player has a deck of 10 characters and all players select one simultaneously and then reveal them in the hope of collecting valuable dragon eggs and avoiding any of the exploding ones (negative points). 

The highest valued characters always take first, but it is the powers of each character that can alter the rules and mess up people's plans. 

I really like this...it sits in the same space as say a Love Letter type of game but has just a little more going on in terms of outthinking the competition. 

Highly recommended if you are after a game in that micro-game / filler space.

One of the best fillers I've played in awhile. Sort of feels like a stripped down Libertalia, but in a good way.

Hardly an original idea in a burgeoning secret-action-selection market - it's really only a thinly-veiled and scaled-down Libertalia (and Libertalia didn't really need scaling down).

Imagine a slightly more developed Love Letter, optimized with high-cost chits, terrible art, offensive language in the rule book, and horrific component quality.

Eggs and Empires has none of those problems.  There, now that I've made my joke, here's the skinny: E&E is a good game.  It is fast, entertaining, works with multiple player counts, and has some really interesting moments in a game.  That said...it's kind of boring.  Yeah, the art is pretty typical swords and sorcery type stuff, and I guess the whole "exploding egg" theme made sense to the developer, but it's just sort of dull.  There's getting to be more and more of these "simultaneously reveal your card...oooh, my number beats your number!" games.  It's wearing thin.  I have literally seven games with almost the exact same mechanic.  E&E at least does it with a little style.

Simple but quite entertaining role-selection game - and one with plenty of light screwing of other players. It's not especially compelling and it's certainly nothing new, but it is quite good fun.

It is quick, it is simple, and yet still a good time.  This takes some of the concepts from a bigger game like Libertalia and slims them down into a playtime I'm happier with.

I'm normally not a big fan of filler-type games, Love Letter in particular, so when this was introduced to me as "a little bit like Love Letter", I cringed.  I love the bidding mechanic with the cards for the eggs that come out and the character powers seem very well-balanced.  I don't think I've ever rated a filler game as an 8, but this one deserves it.  Good stuff!

Played a 6P game once. Eggs and Empires is pretty neat as far as simultaneous action selection filler games go, and that's saying a lot, given the large number of them on the market. This plays a little like [thing=1403][/thing] (as there are cards you wish to avoid taking) with the addition of special abilities to throw a proverbial spanner in the works.

What possibly makes the game stand out in its genre is that there are possibilities to directly rein in the leader with some clever play (although the take that element never overpowers), and that it accommodates 6 players comfortably. The peculiar theme and generic fantasy art is a bit of a mismatch, but this is a commendable design overall.

RATING: 6
This is a quick filler card game where you are trying to beat your opponents to the high scoring eggs while avoiding the negative scoring ones.  It's reminiscent of Lost Legacy in that each card in your hand has a special ability but since you have no clue at all about what your opponents have in their hand and/or what they're playing (until later in the game, by which time your own options are potentially too limited to matter), it boils down to guessing or mitigating risk.

Saw a short interview. Looks a bit like Love Letters, numbered cards, highest gets to pick an egg, lowest may get bad eggs, all cards with additional abilities too. Not out yet as at May 14, going through KS

RATING: 7.5
Very well received game from my gaming group.  The theme is a little odd - "I'm sending out people on a hunt for eggs, and some of those eggs can explode?" But beyond that we really enjoyed the game and everybody would be willing to play it again sometime.  It felt like the simultaneous action selection of 6 Nimmt mixed with the pain you can take from Sticheln (in a loose way).  It also loosely reminded me of Condotierre.  I enjoy all 3 of those games, so it doesn't surprise me that I also like Eggs and Empires!

RATING: 6.3
tl;dr: fine, but I prefer [thing=129622][/thing]

OK, it's not Love Letter really but for me both games fill the same niche. Love Letter just does it better. I also feel like this game has a bigger luck factor. I wasn't able to use the 9, the second most powerful card in the game once. I know how you're supposed to use it, but even then there is always a bit luck factor. The draw of point cards has to be right, the player order has to be right and you have to be lucky with what other players flip. I know that's the nature of the game, but if that's the game we're playing, I'd rather play [thing=153][/thing].
So not bad, but other games do it better.

Initial rating: 6.3/10

Essen 2015. I was very excited to get my hands on this one, but underwhelmed when I got around to playing it (twice with 4 players). Feels a bit more random than expected, and the abilities of cards aren't as deep or decisive as I had thought.

I'm drawn to elegant games.  That is, those with both simplicity and depth.  Eggs & Empires strikes that balance nicely.  It's easy to pick up, even for elementary-age kids, but the richness in trying to divine your opponents moves makes it both strategic and social.

Very good. Mechanisms been seen before with blind auction, but remained good fun and a hit with us all. It was 5p in our group, and I think this was optimism. 2 or 3 players wouldn't wash

RATING: 6
Players have identical decks numbered 1-10 and cards have special powers. Each turn, players select and simultaneously play a card hoping to pick up reward cards with points or avoid cards with negative points. The twist is the possible interactions of the cards' powers. Sound familiar? Does to me. There must be a half dozen games just like this already. But whatever. It's not innovative or all that exciting, but it works fine.

Decent quick playing card game. Can be fun when people are guessing on what types of cards will be played. Pretty heavy on luck, but ok based on the length of the game.

Eggs and Empires is a wonderful blind auction game with just 9 rounds.  Nearly every card has a special power that adds just enough twist into the bidding to keep it interesting but not confusing.

There are an awful lot of things to admire in the design of Eggs and Empires.

This game features blind bidding at it's finest in a  very portable package.  Each player uses the same card range with which to bid,  albeit in a restrictive hand of three.  There are special abilities pertaining to most of the cards and these are done right - as they add subtle options without contributing any unnecessary chaos to the game.  It plays as quickly as any game of this substance that I know of and supports up to six players,  scaling perfectly throughout the spectrum.

Cosmetically,  the theme and artwork are not among it's strong points and the hues lean needlessly toward the dark side.  While I feel they don't detract from the experience,  I certainly see it as a missed opportunity to enhance what is essentially,  a brilliant design.

As far as scoring goes,  there are obvious advantages to the pub scoring rules,  as they are more forgiving and will keep you engaged throughout - no matter how bad of a hand you may have experienced previously.  It seems it may be an arduous task to overcome a large deficit in the cumulative scoring option.  Although I enjoy both the standard and pub scoring rules,  it is for the above reasons that I slightly favor the latter.  Still,  three hands go by relatively quickly and is nice to have two viable scoring options available to suit one's personal preference. 

In either case,  I highly recommend this fast card filler,  especially for those who enjoy simultaneous action.  In the light weight filler department....these eggs are hard to beat.

I hadn't ever heard of this game when it showed up.  And the title didn't do anything to reassure me.  But more on that later.

The game is simple.  There are two egg cards that come out every turn, either good or bad, valued from about -10 to 15 or so.  You have a deck of cards numbered 1 through 10.  You have three of those to choose from at any given time and you pick a card to play, reveal it simultaneously, take eggs in descending numerical order and draw a replacement card.  Oh, and there's a love letter thing going on in that your cards have special powers that let you break the rules of the game.

Back to the title.... Honestly, I have no idea why they named this thing the way they did.  First, Eggs?  Come on!  If we're going to be stealing from a dragon, we should be stealing the dragon's treasure hoard.  That would make a lot more sense.  And you could put pretty pictures of treasure chests, jewels and gold on the cards, with exploding booby trapped treasure chests for the negative cards.  And Empires?  There's nothing in the game that suggests anything of Empires.  It just fit alliteratively.  This is the stupidest name for the game.

The game itself is a quick filler.  My expectations were pretty low on this one, mostly due to the title, so I was actually pleasantly surprised.  It's not the deepest game, but I'd be happy to play it.  I've only played two player so far, which is a little different than the multiplayer game, and I assume that it would be a lot more fun with more players.

A fun little filler. 

SO easy to teach new players, and while it's definitely light it still provides some fun choices for the more experienced players.

It's a solid intro before moving onto something heavier like Libertalia (Or if you don't like conflict, Eggs and Empires is perfect on it's own).

Also fantastic card quality, great feel and lovely art.

After explaining the rules, most players failed to see where the game would be. But almost immediately this changed to player gleefully giving exploding eggs to other players, or using Shepherds to beat Blacksmiths to the Eggs. Great game, easy to explain, lots of fun.

I've only played this solo. I enjoy the resource puzzle vs. the clock, but it's a bit fiddly with all the bits. The fusion mechanism is really cool, but I always found myself simply grabbing the highest cost element I could use that turn while still keeping the star alive (unless I was trying to kill it to move the clock back). It's a good game but I get the feeling that there's a GREAT game lurking underneath with a bit more playtesting and some more elegant mechanisms to replace the fiddly-ness of all the cubes.

A very interesting and unique game, sure to alienate people who are used to either pure Euros or fully Ameritrash games. Here, heavy ecomonic planning and resource generation are combined with arbitrary attack cards that can seem really mean. The end result is a hybrid game in which you laboriously build an economic engine that can be blasted out from under you in an instant. 

On our first play, we were in for a shock, and the game almost ended  with one player's epic near-rage quit. But once we got used to our very fragile economic engines, and learned that having a star blasted out from under you is not always the worst thing, and that cheap, expendable stars are often as valuable as big monster ones, the game took on some really interesting dimensions (no pun intended!). There is a lot of strategy, long-term planning, and sometimes risky timing decisions to be found in this game. Very pleasantly surprised by this one.

I really liked the theme, and I think it is well integrated into the game mechanics.  However, at its heart, the game is essentially just collecting resources and using them to convert to buy "properties" for VPs.  The player who can figure out the most efficient engine will do the best. There is a mechanism for direct player interaction, but it seemed that using one's resources to hurt another player wasted valuable resources that could have been better spent elsewhere.

Yet, the theme is sufficient for me to want to play it again and explore the game space further. I don't think I'll buy it, but I would play it if someone brought it to the table.

This is a really fun, overlooked game. The Fusion mechanic is brilliant. It's an interesting method of converting your various colored cubes into different ones, and messing with the limited supply. It adds a layer of decisions to a simple tableau-building game.

Not much to the game.....just make calculations what energy will convert to which energy and move cubes around. I might try it again later. My first impressions are negative.

I was going to give this another try, read the rules again and remembered how boring it was and how many cubes I had to move around and I couldn't get it to the table.

I played Eons 1 and a half times and I frankly did not enjoy it. I feel the game could be summarized as:
-Obtain colored cubes
-Convert colored cubes to other colors
-Spend colored cubes

The game has little tension and is largely a great deal of accounting and spending currency.

The game has several phases, in which all players get to participate. The phases include discarding cards and drawing back to 7, gaining income from your planets (huh?), spending income to buy cubes, converting cubes on stars to other cubes (huh?), and building planets. 

The first issue is that, because everyone gets to do everything, there's not really any hard choices. of course you'll update your hand. Of course you'll take income. I think the game would be improved if these rounds were instead actions and players had a limited number every round. Do you want to update your hand? Or gain income? Or build a planet? I haven't played enough to know if this would improve the game, but it might.

Secondly, players have too many cards (7), which are largely indistinguishable. For all the planets and stars they basically: Offer more or fewer points and cost a different number of cubes. If you have approx. 5 planet/star cards, each costing on average 4 cubes apiece, plus some of your currency, you have a massive accounting exercise as you go through and figure out all the conversion you need to do in order to build them. I'd much rather see fewer planets that are more distinct and interesting. Instead, just: what do they cost and how many points do I get.

One of the most frustrating aspects of the game is the inclusion of take that cards. Early on they are too expensive to use, but later, they are so powerful for what they cost. Players can destroy stars (which allow you to gain income from planets), destroy planets, or destroy add-ons to the planets. This game is too long and requires too much work for someone to draw a destruction card at random and just set your work back. It's a bad inclusion and just devalues a player's decisions.

I feel the theme had no relevance to the experience. You could strip it away and it'd still be a game of cube management. I didn't enjoy this and do not recommend it.

Beautiful game, and I LOVE the theme. Went from an 8 to a 6 only because the gameplay turned out to be, rounds 1-9 fairly slow and eventless, round 10 crazy fury of activity that put person in last place into lead for the win. Slow burn to explosive finish is not my first choice of games, I like each round to be important.

I'm generally not a fan of the "Kickstarter game" epithet, but man, this is [i]such[/i] a Kickstarter game - I can't see any of the established publishing houses taking a chance on this one. Bland, uninspiring gameplay (seriously, this is pushing cubes around [i]par exellence[/i]), flat theme (for me at least, some at the table found it interesting), and a needlessly punishing amount of opponent-bashing, so much so that the game length itself is determined by how quickly people screw each other over.  I am a bigger fan of direct player conflict than many, but this one did absolutely nothing for me. No desire to play again.

Wow! What a cool concept for a game ... using elements and "cosmic energy" (at least that's what I call it) as resources to build the cosmos ... complete with stars and planets, meteor strikes, novas, black holes, neutron stars. A real gem of a game that I had to pimp.

I picked this up during the kick starter and have never felt compelled to get on this site and talk about the games I own until now.

I am a teacher and will be using this in my class to teach the basics of astronomy.  More with the art and the elemental parts than anything else, but I also love the game, and at my age that says something!

I cannot say enough about the different ways I already found to play with the kids.  The game is fantastic.

I like how the stars undergo fission to change your resources into new resources. Other than that it seems a little lackluster. You can quietly try to build yourself up and hope no one messes with you but they probably will. There may seem like there are many paths you can take but some are effectively blocked off depending on what cards you end up with.

RATING: 4
I was very excited when I read about this game: I thought the theme was fantastic and I was excited to see how this game worked. Now, having played it twice with others and two or three times in the solo scenario available online, I'm very disappointed.

The phases, while somewhat logical, don't flow smoothly from one to the next. I frequently have to remind myself where I am in the cycle. The varying turn order, again somewhat logical, ultimately serves to confuse players as much as it helps mitigate runaway leaders.

Essence, aka money, is (unfortunately) necessary to procure the resources you'll need to create the various stars, planets, etc. This turns the Purchase phase of the game into an exercise in math: How many resources can I buy and still have the Essence leftover to pay for everything I plan to play during the Create phase?

To me, the Fusion mechanic is the only positive aspect of this game. Deciding which elements to keep, which to convert, which stars to let go nova... THESE are interesting decisions. I feel a better game would have been devised in such a way that everything you need to do ought to be done with resources and the fusion cycle of stars. Having money available to buy what you're lacking just detracts from the potential here.

And don't even get me started on the bloodbath that ensues at the end of the game when everyone's playing Supernovas on each other. Seventy-five percent of the math I did over the course of the game gets chucked out the window.

Game took a bit longer than I expected as we were learning the game. Once we made it through a few phases it flowed very well.

Fairly interesting game. Different and new mechanics. I like the fusion and I especially like how the game accounts for people in the lead with different stage turn order  - it doesn't disadvantage those in the lead but it prevents them getting an unfair advantage.

Good with two, great with four or five. Can be 'take thaty' but it is much more fun when playing with a group that doesn't spend their entire game targeting but rather trying to build a star system.

RATING: 6
Strange engine building game where you build planets, that then begin to fuse, creating further but ultimately diminishing resources (a problem in that once a planet cannot fuse it's removed from the game). There's also some hand-management and a need to be able to "defend" your planets as much as possible. You can spend resources on attacks (black holes, etc.) Defense can be achieved by building moons and populations/colonies? off of your planets. Those could get blasted by your opponents but it's better than having a whole planet disappear. The planets left standing at the end of the game determine your score and you should expect scores to take a big hit near the end of the game when the attacks start flying.

Flexible number of players, fun game, interesting mechanics, especially limited resources across players and timing for end game.  Love the theme!  Pretty easy to teach.  Not really conducive to runaway games, because overall score isn't cumulative.
My main complaint is the game develops pretty quickly into Take That, where everyone is deciding who to mess up, and the game may be determined by who wasn't a target, or by a lucky card draw.

Anything but epic, who thought creating a universe could be so boring? 
Gameplay requires significant fore-knowledge of cards in the deck to make sound decisions based on probability. A card manifest is mandatory, but was not included to my knowledge.
Gameplay takes about 6 days and a day for rest, far too long for a quick filler.

Initial impressions: There are a lot of things to keep track of in this game, and I really like that. It plays decently with two, but I think the game would go more quickly with three or four players (or at least I don't think it would get any longer). We played with the beta version, so some of the components were...less than sturdy (namely the essence chits). Hopefully they will be better in the final edition of the game.

Definitely want to play this again, as I know there are many more layers to strategy than I was able to pick up in the first playthrough.

Played a three player game last night and was entertained for two hours. The interesting thing is that I was thinking about the game more this morning which is always a good sign. There seems to be a lot of luck with the card draws and some chaos with the ability to crush your foes with cards, but I quite liked the mechanics and feel there is a deep game lying in there somewhere.

The first thing that occurred to me upon opening the box was a slight intimidation of the rules. At first glance they are pretty complex and rather lengthy. Just reading the rules leaves you with a couple of "Huh?" questions, until you start to play.

After you get through your first few rounds, however, this game starts to make sense, and is really fun. The game strikes a good balance between resource/universe building and attacking.

I'm looking forward to playing this again and again.

RATING: 6
The fusion mechanic is very cool, but there is so many cards that destroy planets and stars that people are playing them simply because their hand is full of them. No one gets to build up much and the game becomes "punish the leader" very quickly. I'm hoping the expansion will help mitigate this, I also haven't tried the coop rules yet. The game is gorgeous, and because fusion is such a neat mechanic I'm going to give the game a bit more time before I decide whether I want to take it off my shelf or not.

RATING: 5
Will try again with a different set of players. But, sadly, there were some issues that made an otherwise interesting game turn sour.

The forced resource conversion of the fusion action is a really interesting and thematic take on the classic Eurogame convention. And, the turn structure flows pretty well.

However, our last four turns included one player being completely unable to obtain resources from the game board. Our last two turns, two players were unable to obtain resources from the game board. This is because our group is generally not mean-spirited, we just like to optimize our purchases. This caused a snowball effect, where the lead player (who inevitably fell into last place) had so much essence, they could've bought everything in the market, but didn't simply because it'd be mean. BUT because of this, we all held onto Supernovas and other destructive cards and unleashed them in the last two turns.

Personally, I ended the game with 5 iron, 4 oxygen, and 3 hydrogen and a hand of 5 useless, unplayable cards. I went from first place by one point to dead last (DESTROYED) in one final turn. Unluckily, I also never drew a large star (which is a key, dominant strategy), so i was unable to make a solar system larger than 2 planets for the entire game. I also had all the materials for a black hole for half the game, but never drew it.

I think with more experienced players the game may improve, but the potential for ganging up, and not being able to do anything on a crucial turn late in the game, which then causes a star to explode, which then causes planets to not be scored is extreme and only for those with very thick skin.

Started with a bang, but ended with a sigh. (will revisit)

First impression - firmly meh. 

- Very "take that" gameplay, with lots of destroying other people's stars... really the only way to go is to get a large star that can accommodate a lot of planets and protect it. Going with lots of small stars just isn't feasible.

- The non-cumulative scoring is a weakness, I find, as it means that the person with the most destructo-cards on the last turn is likely to win.

- The number of elements in your supply being reduced as the entropy counter goes down is a cute idea, but since it is only checked during the account phase it was never really relevant. People just spent as much as they had during the creation phase, just like they had during the rest of the game. 

- Good art, but extremely poor graphic design decisions. Who thought it was a good idea to set rules text on cards in 6-pt Papyrus??? 

I'll give it another try, but not for a while. Just doesn't feel wholly thought-out.

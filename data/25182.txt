RATING: 7
I enjoyed this one.  It reminded me of Scrabble with numbers, in a way.  But, where I wouldn't find that interesting in itself, I feel the goals of 24 and 7 work well.  Also, add in the runs and such, and it makes for a fun game.  Not a chatty game, tho.  Looking forward to playing this with partners.  The pieces are top notch, as well.

update:  Still 7 but now that I have played a handful of times, manipulating the board, I discovered, is just as important.  Trying to set yourself up for multiple scores in a turn, blocking what looks to be a move by your opponent.  I think I prefer this two player.

Incredibly fun tile laying game.  I am not a mathy person, so I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this game.  A game plays in about 20 minutes and we often play two games in a row.  I have played with 2 and 3 players and both play just fine.  My only problem is that every so often we make a mistake and have a line totaling more than 24! :(

I was surprised at how much I liked this one.  It's simple, but still requires quite a bit of thinking.  The scoring is almost self-explanatory, but intriguing.  We played with four; I suspect it's even better with only two.

In a nutshell, this is Scrabble with numbers.

It is a little more accessable than Scrabble and the pieces are very nice. I would not have paid full price for it but it is nice to have around.

RATING: 6
Strategy wise, the game primarily relies on spotting ideal locations to optimize scores.  This is more of a matter of being observant as opposed to any real strategic prowess.  Sure, there are some strategies to employ, primarily keeping a good range of numbers available for placement, especially low-valued numbers.  The overall skill, however, is one of spotting the optimum placements.  There is a bit more control when playing with just 2-players, but the game is also fun and challenging with a full contingent of four.

24 / 7 is a fun, family game along the same lines as games such as Sequence or 5ive Straight.  There isn’t a huge amount to think about, but there are enough decisions to be made to feel one’s victory is deserved rather than happenstance.  Spending time with 24 / 7 is certainly time well spent.

Good fun (even though she smoked me on the last game).Rating after one play of near final prototype*An enjoyable game of tile placement.  What I enjoyed most was scoring the "24" bonuses without realizing it.  Tiles and stands are quality.  I am thinking about picking this one up for one of the Math teachers at the school I teach at.  *KC, Rita, and Carey were very gracious in letting me win the first game I played against them ;-)

A fairly traditional game with nice components. You lay tiles on a 7x7 grid in the hopes of completing sets, runs, or totalling exactly 7 or 24. The kicker is that no group of tiles may go over 24 total. Almost Sudoku-like, this is enjoyable but not very special.

My girlfriend and I love to play this, as does my 12 year old daughter. I like it because the rules are simple, it's easy to play, even for a 12 year old, and it does allow for some deeper strategic thinking. As you improve you can look ahead a few moves to maximize your positional advantage, and you can count the tiles to help you some, (but since three are removed from play before beginning, you can't be absolutely sure what your opponent has or what is remaining.)  It can be aggravating when your opponent screws up something you were planning, and even more rewarding when your plan succeeds!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Interesting abstract.  I couldn't help but draw comparisons to Scrabble (with the double scoring spots) and other mathy grid games like Atlanteon and Kingdoms.  As long as you don't get bogged down (which can be hard to do, as I found myself really taking too long on my turns) is a nice, light family style game.  I think this will be good in helping children add numbers quickly in their head.

Traded away.

RATING: 7
Scrabble with numbers is how I would describe this game. Its an okay filler. Players attempt to make runs or rows of numbers totalling 24 or 7. The tiles have a nice tactile feel to it, but I wish the game had more depth to it. It felt a bit too simple.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

to my surprise both my friends wanted to play again right after I beaten them to a pulp. 
the next game same winner but scores were closer.

this is an interesting quick take on scrabble with numbers. 
there is some luck of the draw but you also make the scoreboard and you can set up opportunities.
I think this is a cleverly designed game.

I only score it a 6 because I would pick can't stop over this to play . there is a little bit more "angst" in can't stop. And in this game people  have to block each other instead of just score points. If they fail to do that or see that. scores will be much higher. and it becomes pretty random I fear.

RATING: 5
highly dependent upon your tile drawing skills but there is a bit of strategy to it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The conflict between seeking to score or blocking opponents from potential high scoring plays seems to be the most difficult decision in the game.  Shines best as a 2-3 player game.  With two players, more planning ahead can be done in seeking to set yourself up for a score.  Plays quickly and is easy to learn, solid filler.

RATING: 6.5
I really like this game for the amount of time it takes to play. 15-20 min for a 3 player game of random fun. Rules could be better tho, for such a simple game they still left out some basic examples of what can/can't be done with the tile laying. Overall a good filler tho.

RATING: 7
There's more to this than meets the eye. You always have interesting choices regarding scoring and blocking. There is a strategic element as the smaller number tiles become increasingly valuable as the game proceeds and as you assess which tiles have been played. With clever observation you can set up some surprising multiple scores. I like the game's relative alacrity. I'm a bit concerned about whether the end game provides enough space for comebacks. More plays will reveal this and the final rating of the game may change acccordingly. The game is not particularly original (I'm reminded of Deal Me In, Zatre, and Cribbage) but it is nicely implemented and the scoring system is ingenious.

RATING: 6.75
Reasonable "number Scrabble" game.  However, with only 37 tiles to draw from, compared with the 100 in Scrabble, a bad rack is a killer.  Rules need some definition, too (any option to toss tiles? are 'logically unplayable' spaces marked with a Pente pebble? why not count pips at end of game like Scrabble, because usually everyone will have the same number of tiles?).

One more thing: this game is crying out for an upgrade from the publisher.  A simple reference card or, better yet, a board that shows the scoring combinations and their value would have been great.  As it is, you need to hand each player a blank score sheet just to know the possibilities (and even that doesn't mention how to get the 'bingo' bonuses).  I'm sure someone on BGG has or will supply such an aid, but that's not the proper solution.  The game company should have thought of this one.

RATING: 6
Reasonably fun, abstract.  My big concern is just that, without good tile draws the latter part of the game is painful, since there's little that can be done to help yourself or set up later moves, i.e. nearly zero strategy.  And once the draw pile is exhausted, there's a bit of a game of chicken, and whoever goes first will have a hard time pulling one out.  (Full disclosure: that was me in my one playing.)  Also, the later rounds, once option dwindle, became slower and slower.

24/7 The Game -- Played three- and four-player.  This game brings to mind Kings Cribbage, but where Kings Cribbage is an invitation to Analysis Paralysis, 24/7 is a lightly mathematic filler with just enough strategy to overcome luck and make decisions consequential.

Dull looking 'maths' game where players are placing domino-like numbered tiles on a gridded board. There are points for scoring a sum of 7 or 24 and getting 'straights' of 3 to 5 tiles.

There's too much luck as someone could easily setup a large score for you (you don't know what tiles others have and vice versa). Later in the game, if you can't do anything good, you're essentially using your tiles to 'block' opponents or dump them blindly.

The box graphics on the box doesn't exactly 'sell' the game.

I really like this as a 2-player game.  But I was surprised/happy to discover that the 4 person game plays as quickly (just under 1/2 an hour) and feels lighter.  In a two-player game, there's lots of calculated risk-taking and tradeoffs between offense and defense.  The 4-person game seemed much more oriented toward identifying the best opportunities.  The three 3rd-graders (and one onlooker) I played with clearly found the game fun and challenging.  I still have a strong preference for the 2 player game, but see how younger players (and parents/teachers looking for a math enrichment activity) might feel differently.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Like Zatre but plays much faster because of the small board.

There are 40 tiles numbered 1-10 x 4; get a hand of 6. First player must play in 1 of the 9 central spaces. Thereafter, players alternate playing 1 tile at a time. Tile must touch a previously played tile (orthogonal or diagonal), and no line may sum to more than 24 (when 24-line created, mark illegal spaces with tokens). You score when you create a variety of combinations (runs of 3-6, sets of 3 or 4, sum of 24, sum of 7; bonus if you get 24 and 7 with one play. The game ends when no more plays are possible.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
A pretty clever game idea that plays quickly and is easy to learn.  Reminds me of Scrabble in the sense that you have to be careful not to set up your opponent and other times you're trying to set up a big score only to have your plans foiled!  The tiles are very sturdy and a nice touch to a good game.

I think I'd almost always rather play Qwirkle, unless I only had half the time and space to play. It's a solid little game, but it has the unfortunate timing of coming on the heels of a similar game that has become one of my all time favorites.

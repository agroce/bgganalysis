{1 play, 3 player} An okay game, that's maybe better with more players... or maybe better the second time (now that we learned it).  My worry, though, is that more players will add to game length, and this one's not really meaty enough to warrant too long a playing time.  Great use of theme, though - everything makes logical sense.  I can't see - especially in a three-player game - how you'd ever fill that 4 palms market.

I had peculiar interest in this one going way back in my board gaming career.  I bought a copy on eBay many years ago, and only recently got around to actually playing it.  The appearance is very spartan, with my only complaints being the practically indistinguishable seed side of the goods and the kinda awkward wave dominoes.  The nile ebb and flow effect wasn't nearly as cool as I thought it might be.  I found the game very boring and overly tactical, but I don't find any particular fault design-wise.

The mechanism with the changing water level of the Nile is interesting and gives some push your luck element too it. All in all, the game is ok but doesn't offer enough for additional plays.

Good game with an unusual tide/flood mechanism that takes a few reads to understand but is simple in play. Feels a little clunky compared to some contemporary titles, but stands up and is a decent game regardless.

Fun game.  Lots of strategy.  You have to be careful when the Nile floods and also when it starts to dry up.  Just when you think you're home free, other players can use flood and desert tiles to rot your fruit in the marketplace or wash it away in the fields.  Lots of tension.

RATING: 7
Dec 2012 - only played as a two player.  It's an insteresting game that ebbs and flows (not meant to be a smart ass on it).  The players can control the rythym of the game pretty well, but it can be disrupted with some of the flood tiles pushing the tempo sometimes.  That keeps you on your toes, I think.  So, you have the tempo, produce seeds/ripening, bringing to market with only so many actions (points) per turn. You have stuff to consider and if you are not on top of it, you will lose.

I personally know that I'll boost it to a 7 once I play with three.  The double turn that happens in two player will be gone.  I'm glad I finally got this to the table.  

Well, I just gave it a seven.  :)  It would be a six with two players.

RATING: 5
Poor english translation doesn't help. The game itself is 'okay', showing it's age a bit now and the components don't help - you can see what flood tiles are coming up by looking at the edges (we put them in a bag). Slightly too long for what it is.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
We only played this 2 player, and it really didn't work very well.   I suspect that with 3 it might be somewhat better, but overall this game is pretty aged.

The theme is pretty good (albeit yet another Egypt theme), but the gameplay is pretty bland.   The random tiles would also be pretty irritating if you get unlucky.

So, nothing much to see here, move on.... rated 6 because of the general good presentation of the game.

A unique feel to this one, with quite a lot going on for a game of this vintage and the mechanisms matching the setting well - but a bit dry, despite the theme.

Another in the category of fairly generic german games that didn't quite have any kind of an "edge" to grab you. Not bad, but not one I'll play again given the competition. I try not to keep more than 100 "euro" games in my collection, but all of them are better than this ... so you see the problem.

This is a hard one to describe. I think I must confess the production values kept me from trying this one for a long time. I'm sure its also dropped the rating by one level. On the basis of just the rules or strategy its pretty good but on the other hand it is about a 2-3 hour game. For some reason I could see a lot of room for strategy but none of us were interested in using any of it. One player had a lead so we just ended the game by scoring the round to finish instead of making optimal plays. Then everyone said whats next lets not play that again. One player said I give that a hearty 4 out of 10.

Boring game with a bland map. I'm quite tired of those Egyptian themed games which didn't improve on the game.

RATING: 7
Just 1 play but thought it was pretty good.  Place your seed tokens down and hope they don't get wiped out by a flood or drought.  Take your harvested goods to market to score vps.  Simple but actually pretty original for its time.  The stage where water is removed adds a lot of screwage.  It can really make or break you if you happen to harvest at the wrong time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
My players bailed after a few rounds but I really liked this. A better rules translation would help, but I think it does what it says on the tin. Farm on the banks of the Nile, try to harvest your crops to market before the floods wash them away. But beware the desert encroaching as the Nile recedes. A clever mix of mechanisms, especially the flooding, this old game lacks modern graphic design which would help a lot. If you like games with some forethought, give this a try.

Warning! Rating based on a single playing, with some rule errors! (I explect my rating would go up 1 point with more plays.) The game works, but is a little bland. You don't have the feeling you're building something up, you're just slowly moving towards the end game condition. In other words, the "development" aspect of the gameplay is a little bit neglected and consequently the game lacks clear short term (or even long term) goals.

An Den Ufern Des Nils is an original game that's central mechanic is unique unto itself.  The core of the game is based around the ebbing and flooding of the Nile river.  This is played out by an interesting tile-laying mechanic that really creates an authentic feeling of a tide.  Players are farmers on the Nile's banks planting, harvesting and then selling goods for profit.  There is a small element of push your luck, as well as general risk management played out by how close one is willing to plant to the river's edge aware that a flood could quickly rise.  Although the Nile's temperment is controlled by tile draws there is enough open information that the patterns of the river can be assessed so therefore cutting down the risk.  An Den Ufern Des Nils could appear to create an environment for a lot of player screwage, however strong planning will prevent this - unless of course the gods are determined to flood Egypt.  A unique, forgotten gem.

UPDATE: 
I am lowering my score to a five as there seems to be little replay after the first few outings.  The game shows it's age once the novelty of the river mechanic wears off.

Played one game and thoroughly enjoyed it.  There are lots of subtle strategies to ponder. And if you like resource management games, you can't get much better.  Our game did seem to have a bit of a "king maker" element and I think that a runaway leader would be hard to stop (without playing some of the optional rules), but it still deserves a solid '7' rating.

RATING: 6
Definitely a preliminary rating, as I've only played with 2 and the game clearly needs more, since the scoring is way too flat.  Though that didn't stop our game from being a blowout.

It's hard to approach this game on its own merits without thinking about how old it is (almost 20 years old now!)  Whenever I play an old game in my mind I'm thinking, "They didn't know then what we know now, so it'll be a little clunky."  And usually that is correct.

This one pretty much follows those rules at well.  It feels dated, or at least different than most of the games we play now.  The rules themselves are at a good level of complexity, there aren't too many of them and once you start playing it all makes sense.  I guess the main mechanic is the rise and fall of the Nile, which makes the game feel somewhat thematic, though it introduces a healthy dose of randomness.

Played as a 2-player it's pretty straightforward (attack your opponent).  I think it might be more interesting with more so I will update if/when that ever happens.

RATING: 8
Interesting, strange and rather unique game. The mechanisms aren't very familiar, but fit in nicely with the theme. The raising of the Nile and the advancing desert make for some tough choices where to grow plants. Selling the harvest on the markets with a majority will result in the most points, but take in account that you'll need different types of plants. Played once and definitely need to replay this in the future.

First of all, the english translation of rules aren't the best ones, so maybe some rules went wrong - I hope so. Because the game wasn't very good... a quite boring actually, because many of the decisions are too obviously but still the game takes time too much.

Needs all 5 players so all the provinces come out.  A lot of fun.  The most difficult and challenging part is province assessment which varies depending on the player and the point in the game.  Only complaint is that sometimes purchases seem a bit apparent as there is an "optimal spend" if money is sufficiently plentiful.  A big lead after the first half is sometimes very hard to overcome.

I like this game quite a bit.  It plays well, and the egyptian theme is strongly reflected in the mechanics of the game (unlike the Knizia stuff like Ra, Tutanchamun, or even Amun Re!).  If you want to play a game that actually DOES have an Egyptian theme, try this one. 

Rating went from 7 to 8 with more plays, and could go higher -- great game!

Played pretty well the first time even without a good grasp on the strategies available, and there are several. A good review of the effects (and distributions) on the backs of the tiles is needed for intelligent play. The flood cycle rules seemed a bit unclear too (watch out for those little arrows on some of the tiles). English rulebook is miserable.

The variants rules hold no appeal for me, I was hoping for more.

Likely to move up to an 8.

Desert tiles: 10 hippo, 5 each of the other 1-4 palms

Water tiles: 10* hippo, 15 pyramids, 5 each of the other 1-4 palms (*misprinted green pyramid should be a hippo)

I really like this one.  I always feel like all the "pieces" fit well...(Just upped my rating to 9.5; this is a Top 5 game for me.  Aside from relatively insignificant problems with graphics and bits, there's almost nothing about this game that I don't like.)

RATING: 5
Horrible horrible awful practically illegible rulebook.  After a few turns, we thought we had it figured out, and since the five of us were all newbies anyway, it still ended up working out.  This game has flooding, dessication, planting, growingm harvesting, selling, and pretty much everything you do uses a mechanic not truly reminiscent of any other game.  It all hangs together OK, with the risk management of which quality fields to work being the key decision, but in the end it felt like a lot of stuff going on to just grab more majorities in areas (market stalls, in this case).  Wouldn't automatically turn down another game of this, but there's a lot of other stuff I'd rather see hit the table.

RATING: 8
Unlike most Egyptian Euros this game actually has a theme that feels intermeshed into the mechanics.  The game does a fantastic job of emulating the rising and ebbing of the Nile and the encroaching desert.  With fewer players, it takes some serious strategical planning, with some nice tactical maneuvering to get ahead, and the game rewards players that are able to take in the big picture.  With more players, much of the game is timing when to strike.  Space gets tight, resources get tight, and you constantly have to decide what to sacrifice in order to get ahead.  My rating has gone up with more plays.  If you can get through the poorly written rulebook, then you will discover a lovely gem of a game.

Sowing, growing & harvesting fruit on the Nile in the hope of earning points when a market sells its stock. There’s a really unusual ebb & flow mechanism making the Nile and desert encroach on the fields. As with so many markets, timing seems to be everything.

Interesting game that really captures the feeling of the ebb and flow of the Nile. Unfortuantely, the game feels a little too random with the desert tiles, flood tiles, and the spoiling rules. Besides that the game is fairly interesting and has a good theme to rules fit, just not really my type of game.

Nice idea, especially the ebb and flow of the Nile is very well and thematically executed, but it's way too long for what it is with unacceptable downtimes involved, with quite a lot of luck coming from the card events too. English translation of rules is somewhat wanting.

RATING: 3
Interesting mechanics that at least make an attempt at simulating the ebb and flow of the Nile, but the result is terribly fiddly. The action point system works fine, but is a bit dull in this one. The game isn't a lot of fun, is pretty dry for a game that revolves around water and seems lacking in tension. Reacting to the changing flood and drought phases also makes this game very tactical and eliminates much chance at strategy, which is a downside for me. An Den Ufern Des Nils is a clear miss, but it is, at least somewhat unusual and unique.

Players attempt to grow their crops on the banks of the Nile. As the river ebbs and floods, players spend action points to buy & sow seed in the fields, grow and then harvest their crops. Water tiles serve to flood the fields and players score most points for producing the freshest produce.

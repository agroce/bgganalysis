I quite like this one, though it is very much a middle-ranking bidding game.  It's really not as good as Modern Art, Medici or Ra, but nevertheless is fun enough and a nice change.  It plays quickly and though the theme is a little tacked on it is still quite pleasant and has some interesting mechanisms.  I will certainly happily play this one if it's offered up.

Everything you can do is determined by winning bids. Not bidding and conserving funds also gets you victory points, so there's a trade-off.

RATING: 6
This is a game that really takes a couple of plays to decide if it works for you or not.  The first plays, players will not know how to combine the explorers and maximize their bids.  It is hard to know how much something is worth.  If played without much thought - it is possible to actually earn less victory points than if you didn't do anything (but turn in your cards for VP at the end).  Once you get an idea of the worth of the explorers in specific situations, the game becomes a tight bidding game that has a nice accelleration effect as the game comes to a conclusion.  Worth the effort to play more than twice.

Initial rating, based on playing once. Looks like a very tight auction game. It's not easy to evaluate the different tracks. Luck of the draw with money cards feels like it might be too swingy, and the first round is extremely important, because being locked out there can effectively mean the end of the game for you, which is somewhat vexing.

RATING: 8
Players choose to participate in or hold back from auctions/battles. Winning funnels players into more specific player interactions and provide combinations of interesting bonuses. Add to that the changing importance of money/VP over the course of a game and--violà--you have something that is clever and great fun. Probably just okay with four players and likely not very good with three.

Pizarro is in the company of so many other auction game fillers out there that frankly I didn't even know it existed until 2009!  Keep in mind that I am rarely in search of filler.  Compared to the other auction game fillers out there (Ra, Modern Art, Hollywood Blockbuster, For Sale, etc) Pizarro appears to be just as good, if not slightly better.

Anyway, I liked that each explorer had certain benefits.  I also liked the overall structure of having only 3/2/1 explorations per explorer, per round.  Unfortunately the money cards add some lucky swings to the game.

I like this game for the neat balance you need to have, and the interesting switch from hoarding high cards to pay for stuff to hoarding low cards for points. The variants on the explorers is a nice addition as well.

RATING: 5
I particularly enjoy the special powers, a rarity in German games. Also the money doubling as points, while not wholly original, provides that needed clever twist to the bidding system. As with most bidding games, the values of the different explorers take a few games to solidify. Experienced players lift this to a whole new level. And when things grow stale, just flip the boards to revalue the explorers. Unfortunately, as the game progresses, the auctions lose a little of their tension and consequently, the final year falls a little flat.

Got this unexpectedly in a math trade, and it's actually not bad at all.  The different explorer powers are challenging to mesh together into a strategy, which makes it fun.  Took awhile to figure out exactly how to play.

The manual was rather complex to read (are there any well written manuals ?).  As such we only found out at the end of the game what it was really about.  This game certainly has some potential and is therefore worth some more attention in one of our future visits to the boardgame club.

If you don't like auction games avoid this one. It has strategic bidding with fixed-value cards which I like, but that is totally overwhelmed by the random income allocation, also the theme is paper thin, what are we bidding on? why?? Why are high value cards worth less vps than low value ones? For game balance, but no linkage to theme that I can see. Felt dull when I played it, and was glad when it was over, wouldn't want to play it again.

I was suprised how fun this auction game is.
So many agonizing decisions you need to take every turn. The bidding for the explorers are also very tight, as you need to keep a eye on your money. You never have enough.

One of the best auction games out there in my opinion. Much like RA, but so much more focus on the pure auctions.

A pretty standard bidding game, with a silly tacked-on theme... but something about it makes me and my friends keep coming back for more. The only reason I don't rate it higher is that a player who makes an early mistake can be effectively out of the game in the first round, limiting the fun severely. This is another game that was instrumental in introducing my non-gamer friends to "Euro-style" games.

Nice game; bumped my rating up a notch after a few plays. Sort of like an auction cousin of Titan: the Arena. Very easy to play, but lots of tough choices due to the variety of explorer &quot;powers&quot; and the way they interact, and the fact that the question of how much money to conserve for later rounds is very tricky. Lots of good tensions.
The double-sided boards are a nice touch too. One of the better auction games going, IMHO; while lacking the design elegance and efficiency of Modern Art, I liked it much better than Medici. Make sure to allow players to win a single explorer multiple times in the first round.

1-hour or less auction game with some nice strategic elements. The gameplay focuses very nicely in the second and third rounds so you have only a few very important auctions and thus more time and attention to focus on strategy.

RATING: 7
Pure auction game that plays six and is very easy to understand.  Belongs in every collection because it plays 6 and is a great gateway game.  Medici, which also plays 6 under an hour, would take this spot but for high math and thin theme.  I like Medici but Pizarro & Co. is a overall better game.

The special powers of each character are hard to remember when you have not played awhile so not sure if this game is a keeper.

A very interesting auction game where different explorers give you a different bonus and depending where you reach at the end of the game gives you differing bonuses and points. It is weighing these up to know where to spend you limited funds that is key to this game. 1 Play.

This game contains some fun to be had.  It pretty much boils down to just an auction game where what you win determines what your bidding for later.  The theme adds a lot to the game for me, but how you get your money back detracts.  You can really be out of the game after round 1, which isn't so bad since round 1 is 3/4 of the game.  Rounds 2 and 3 play very quickly.

RATING: 8
I find Pizarro somewhat similar to Princes of Florence in the sense that the players are all bidding for characters that have different powers, and in each game the powers are more straightforwardly mathematical than is the case in, say, Evo.  Pizarro's explorers have a more subtle effect on scoring than do, say, the tiles in Ra or Traumfabrik, but there's still a reasonably direct, if complicated, mathematical base to the valuation. It's not like Santiago or Evo where you have to figure in how things might move around in space.  I've heard two criticisms of it:  that the game tends to devolve into people going for separate monopolies, and that the cards introduce too much luck.  It's my view that the first criticism is just wrong if people know what they're doing, and re the second, the luck of the cards is well balanced between bidding power and victory points.  Bottom line -- it appears to me to be a very fine game.  Someone once wrote that if Knizia had designed this it would be regarded as a masterpiece, and though I tend to agree with that.

This is a fast-paced, fun auction game. Although it doesn't match perfectly, the theme seems to work for me. I love the way the supply of explorers is reduced each phase and you must be present on that explorer from a prior phase to be elegible to bid. 

The reversible boards was a great extra touch to this game, to give it more longevity and mix things up a bit in terms of evaluating the relative worth of each guy. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Game mechanics have interest: the initial round setting the stage for the latter ones, the balance between income and points, variable explorer powers, different board combinations, etc...but all of this is hurt by the inane money system which can ruin well-laid plans, dig bad players out of holes, and basically hurt the game in a variety of ways. The higher point value of low money cards *is not* enough to save you if you draw too many of them in the final two stages of the game, not even close; what this basically means is that someone who sets themselves up to draw several cards can end up with equal income to someone who only gets the basic two if the draw goes awry. I am not a fan of these kinds of mechanics in an otherwise well thought out and interesting game, and in this case it takes the rating down significantly. A pity, this feels like it was so close to finding that sweet spot between serious and light auction games too.

Magelaen (the Dutch title for this game) has a bit of history attached to it for me. I bought this blindly at a firesale of 999 Games a few months after I started boardgaming seriously, having no idea what it was about. Unfortunately I hadn't learned at the time that games on sale are probably not that good; in addition Magelaen presented a problem in that I needed three and possibly four players to play the game with. There was just me and my partner back then, and on the rare occasion that I could find a gaming partner Magelaen always got pre-empted. After a year or two I sold the game unplayed and more or less forgot about it. Until the other day, nearly 10 years later, when it suddenly hit the table at a friend's house. He hadn't played it either in all that time. So we cracked open the box and fired up Tom Lehmann's handiwork.

Magelaen is all about auctions for special things: points and more cards, in various combinations. The neat little trick about it is that getting better combinations requires ongoing investments, of which there are increasingly less. So if you don't get in on the action (so to speak) from the beginning, you're not allowed to participate for the good stuff in the end. A simple concept which promotes a pleasant level of asymmetry at the same time. 

As such I couldn't fault much in Magelaen: it's a clean auction game with a strong progression towards the end. Do more with (a lot) less, that sort of thing. I just found it very difficult to put a value to the various fields and progression steps, especially in conjunction with the fact that the money itself carries a VP value too, and rolls in semi-randomly. I don't think this is an easy game to master. Would I want to play again? Not to the point where I'm jumping up and down with excitement, but a few more games to see if any progression or insight improvements can be had, sure, why not.

Components: Good graphics and iconography.  Quality, half-sized cards.

Experience: Standard auction game, with the newness being in the object of our bidding, and how winning one auction will dictate one's future moves.  The decisions about where to allocate my money becomes easier as my options dwindle, but the agony of deciding how much to commit to any one explorer only increases as the game progresses.

Not enough tension with three players, as each player is relatively assured of getting all explorers on the board during the first round. Also, the game can be quite severe in both punishing a player who has invested in too few explorers, and in their fellow players (who must now bid against a player who has no other competing interests).

This game is nothing more than a series of auctions to gain special abilities and eventually points. The game opens up with 18 auctions across 6 types. After the initial round, only players who won that type of auction in the past are allowed to participate. That's where this game falls flat. Since the order of the auctions is random, you may be sitting on the sideline waiting for a turn for an unknown period of time. Conversely, you can be in every auction right away making your position weaker and giving a huge advantage to opponents who are inactive in the beginning of the round. 

As with most auction games, knowing how to price the rewards is huge and something that takes multiple plays to get down. We played with 6 players and that felt like the right number to make each bid have impact. With less players the game might be too open and not as tense. I would play it again with the right group of 5+ people. Not one I think I could get a group to play on a regular basis if I owned it.

Fun auction game.  All players are involved in round 1.  Unfortunately, rounds 2-3 introduce player downtime as those each auction only include up to 3 of the players.

Dropped from 7-->6 after one playing saw one guy get outbid in every category except one (he had all 3 tokens there).  He ended up winning the game w/out making a single decision after round 1.  I'd rather lose than win under that circumstance...how boring.

RATING: 7
Interesting theme about hiring explorers (who lived hundreds of years apart) via auction.  Explorers have abilities that help you earn victory points (to win) or money bags (for auctions).  The game is played over 36 auctions and it works very well IF everybody picks up a few explorers in phase 1.  Rather like this one.  Playing four different ways via reversable boards is a great idea.  Coming in well under an hour, a great little game.

[Lehmann] Here on BGG "auction game" seems to have become synonymous with "Knizia". Which is too bad, because folks seem to have overlooked this gem from the designer of FFF. There are four different ways to configure the board, which adds to the replayability factor. With the exception of Taj Mahal, this is better than the majority of the Knizia auction titles and offers a wonderful fun payout for very little fuss.

Rég játszottunk vele, de miután 6-an voltunk hosszú idő után először , újra előkerült.Licitálós játék, aminek érdekessége a 3 szakasz, és h a második szakaszban  már csak az licitál, aki az adott felfedező/hajósra az első szakaszban nyert licitet. Így a játék első szakasza a leghosszabb, a második, harmadik drasztikusan rövidül. Jó ötlet, jó megvalósítás. Ugyan vigyázni kell, mert rossz licitekkel a játék első részében ki lehet esni, de ez azért kis figyelemmel elkerülhető. Ha a második részben esik ki vki - erre azért van esély, akkor már nem kell sokat várnia, a 3. szakasz max 10 perces. Jó ötlet még a tábláK a/b oldala, ezek kombinálásával több "pálya" rakható ki, játszható. 
S h ki mire licitál? Nos minden felfedező mást ad, jól kell összerakni, kitalálni, h eredményes legyen a játékos

I played Pizarro & Co. twice so far and found the game interesting.

I am looking forward to another game of Pizarro & Co to have a better opinion of the game. I really want to test the value of each explorer and compare it to the other bidding\auction games I own. Also, see the differences during a game with the two boards. The board plays vice-versa. It's a bit different. Newbies and expert (I think).

I think Pizarro & Co. could be a real winner. Now it just needs to hit the table again at some point to test each explorer.

How you manage your money in this game can be important on who wins and loses.  It's not as easy as it looks. If you spend too much for an explorer, it can really hurt you for future biddings. So you could say good bye to future points by spending too much.

TRADED.

Very intuitive and easy to learn to play. Similar in theme to Age of Discovery but the auction mechanic here creates a more exciting game than the action choice mechanic for AoD. What I really like is how versatile this game can be. While not as brilliant as Modern Art, the simplicity can be an advantage as it can serve as a filler to experienced players but also a neat intro for newbies. Brilliant!

Also, one of the few games that works well with 6 and that alone pushes it up several notches in my view.

As they say, an oldie but goodie.

A surprisingly good game. Now that I've played a complete game, this one has gone up from 8 to 8.5. It could make 9 perhaps with more play. We really had fun with this one. It is an auction and a bluffing game (36 auctions to be exact). If you like auctions, you will enjoy this one. The bluffing is part of the auction and adds to the enjoyment.

I can't think of another game so deprived in thematic development.  You have this great mechanic, the declining auctions, but surround it with nothing interesting.  For those who think theme is just silly wallpaper, this is the game for you.  Try to come up with a logical explanation about what is supposed to be happening.

The auction mechanic should get re-used in a meatier game.  This does play six and quickly, giving it a useful game ecology niche.

Played just once with 6 players.  I think this game may rate better after repeat plays and an understanding of how best to use the explorers, but my first play seemed confusing and chaotic.

RATING: 7.5
Grossly underrated bidding game, and especially tense with 6 players.  This game is worth owning for that reason alone as there are not many games that provide this caliber (and relatively short playing time) for 6 players.

Obviously, with 3-5 players there are better games to play but I see this working reasonably well with 4 or 5.

The reason why I can't give this game an 8 or higher is due to the feeling of not having quite enough control.  Manipulating the order in which the explorers arrive for bid isn't quite enough.

First impression: Gets a little repetitive but not too bad, my wife might like it.  I like auction games and I like how it tightens up/speeds up at the end.  Good design.  I would rate it a point higher if it was played with a group that played quickly.

It's a game that you could play instead of Ra for an auction fix.  I feel it's less fiddly easier to learn than Ra as well. ...But of  the two, I think Ra is more interesting.

I'm looking forward to playing it again, it seems like there are some things to try...

RATING: 6
A very simple auction game at heart made difficult by highly variable payouts and the fact that if you don't get in on a certain path early you will not have the opportunity to benefit from that particular path ever. And of course there are limited spaces available for each path (and they are reduced further each round) which forces some defining decisions to be made very early in the game.

It's a fairly short game so the luck of the draw from the money cards doesn't hurt too much, and neither does being locked in to a combination of paths after the first round.

sweet little auction game. the auction system works really well in this game with the back and forth bidding, unlike goa where you have to decide if you want the tile straight away. it's also well balanced and players don't really have the game won until close to the end. works well as a 2 player also which is a novelity for these types of games which claim to cater for 2 players but often need almost a full house to work.

Enjoyable game - I compared it to Medici in weight and interest - fast and fun.  Dropped from 8 to 7 when played recently (Dec 2005) - there are just too many games entirely driven by an auction mechanism.  This one does it nicely but them isn't strong enough to pull it out from the pack.

RATING: 7
This is a really interesting auction game that for me goes a step beyond an auction game like Ra.  In Ra you basically bid to collect sets.  In Pizarro, you bid to back your explorer and each explorer has their own special benefit or action.  Choices must be made as there is no way you can continually back everyone.  Also, there are variable set-ups to the board which make for a nice change of pace.  The game is nicely put together, although the art doesn't grab me and I am not too fond of the scoring track.

The eighteen initial auctions that open the game lack tension, and threaten to lose players' attention with their monotony.  The coastline of the game doesn't take shape until the later parts of that first round, but by that time your lookout cries "Land Ho!" it may be too late to change tack.  The game is probably already won or lost at this point, and although you can see what you should have done differently in retrospect, can you realistically be expected to see it as it's happening?  Maybe the answer is "yes" for some players, but that hasn't been my experience.  My experience has been that you find yourself locked into a specific course, and the rest of the game plays itself out based on factors like: which specific players you're bidding against, the order of the explorer cards, and the value of the gold cards you draw in later rounds.  Experts may have found a clarity that I have not.  In spite of these criticisms, I've (somewhat) enjoyed my plays so far. In the end, Magellan is a game that nearly makes it all the way around the world, but then dies somewhere near the Philippines. Magellan is probably more interesting with less than the full six players, but it suffers from the Showmanager syndrome: it gets played mostly with six due to slim pickings for that configuration.

It has some neat ideas.  The thing that bothered me is that lack of granularity.  Certain explorers are much better than others.  I also think luck plays a large part in the cards you draw.  Having the low value cards worth more points offsets the luck a bit, but not enough imo.

Still, it's a fun and interesting game, but one that wears out pretty quickly.  You'll probably get 5-8 good plays out of it, which is probably enough these days.

RATING: 8
Enjoyable game, hard to know what (and when) to bid at first, but gets better on second playing.  May get a bit similar, once players work out which explorer they think is the best, and bid on the same ones each game.  But this can be changed a bit by the flippable boards.  Played another couple of games recently and realized that each game plays fairly diffently depending on how high players start off bidding and on the order of the explorers.

Very interesting and tense auction game with a subtle strategic element. Both the tension and an aspect of tactical planning are provided by the cards (used as the currency of the auctions, as well as providing end-game victory points), while further tension and the scope for strategy is due to the fact that winning auctions provides more cards and/or end-game victory points and also allows a player to progress to more valuable auctions in later rounds. I've played with 3, 5 and 6 players. With the higher number, the bidding is more fun. However, with fewer players there is more scope for strategy and planning, as it is possible to keep track of your opponents' positions (how many and maybe even which cards they possess, which explorers they have already bid on during the round etc.) and take this into account.

I might not be giving this game fair credit but I find it very dry and not that much fun. Keep in mind what it gets compared to though, POF and others. 

An auction game that does have a good dose of subtle strategy which is right up my alley but it does not compare favourably to other titles in the genre including Medici which is much more fun. There is a good dose of luck in the money system and some auctions will see some players completely shut out to only stand by and watch (mind you this happens in Medici too). 

Its another of many "doesn't do anything too terribly wrong but nothing really right either" games. In the end the desire to play just isn't there as competition is pretty high in this style of games. Too bad as another 6 player auction game would have been good to keep around.

Update: Sat too long on the shelf...

Yet another somewhat disappointing exploration game.  In fact the theme is pretty much pasted on and the game play pretty dry. Some explorers seem obviously better than others at time too and the final auction round is non eventful because it's down to just two (or one) players bidding against each other and the card cost to explorer value is easy to figure out. Too dry, too theme-thin, and a bit too "mathy", even for me.

I like the new take on auction games.  The variability of the boards adds complexity to the formulation of strategies

We played this again recently (2/06) after about 2.5 years gathering dust, and I wsa reminded of how nice a game this is.  It plays well - and quickly - with 6 (a feat unto itself), and provides a nice balance of speed and mental effort.

The only real problem I have with the game is the 2nd and 3rd phase auctions.  If you didn't get a particular explorer in round 1, you shut out of all subsequent auctions for that particular explorer.  While this makes the 1st round auctions very competitive, I fell this mechanic makes the 2nd and 3rd round auctions rather academic and lacking in tension.

Tom Lehmann is the Alfred Hitchcock of boardgames. Hitchcock made some phenomenal movies in England in the 1930s, and after a while Hollywood welcomed him with open arms. His movies suffered in the 1940s as he tried to work within a new set of expectations. In the 50s he came into his own once again and started kicking ass and taking names. Lehmann has followed a similar trajectory within the gaming world, spending quite a bit of his own money publishing intriguing games  in the early 90s, finally being recognized by the Euro Hivemind in the early 00s, and eventually coming into his own again as the premier designer we now recognize him to be.

Well, Pizarro is from the middle period, and it shows.

The game consists of 36 auctions for six distinct benefits. The twist is that each benefit has three levels to it, and that you may not bid on a subsequent level unless you won an auction for the previous level. So, as the game progresses, each player is committed to fighting over a slightly different set of the rewards against a subset of the opposition.

And that's about all I have to say about it. No theme, nothing particularly clever, just a competent idea for a game.

RATING: 7
Magellan is a pure auction game which probably explains to a large extent why it wasn't able to garner the popularity which could have resulted from Lehmann teaming with Hans-im-Glück.
As every auction game it needs competent players who are able to gauge what an offer is worth for themselves and what it might be worth to others. Letting another player win a crucial auction cheap can decide the game early on. This is favoured by the unique structure of Magellan: It's played in three rounds. Players bid on six explorers. In the first round each explorer is auctioned three times, two times in the second and only one time in the third round. Only players who successfully bought into an explorer in the previous round are allowed to bid on this explorer in the following round. Hence, players will be locked into a more or less promising path midway through the game.
Details such as the special powers of each explorer and the double function of money as VP's top off the package. A solid game that is short enough to mitigate the problem of being decided prematurely.

This is different for an auction game. The "voyages" that you win can be worth points, money , special actions or some combination of the 3. You always know exactly what will be available for auction and what they are all going to be worth come the scoring and income rounds. Bids you win early set up your possibilities in later rounds, and skillful play can lead to some very cheap later purchases. Luck definitely plays a part during income, as you can only control how many income cards you receive, and not the actual values on those cards. This is a lot of fun, but the mechanics are not as "pure" as in Modern Art or Medici. The theme works well.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Pizarro has a creative way of making you choose your battles/auctions carefully.  I like how the relative scarcity of money (and fixed denominations) increase the tension level of the game.  One downside is that downtime could potentially be a problem if there are many auctions in which you do not participate.  But overall it's a very simple auction game, quite pure.  It seems that with a lot of play a possible optimum path to victory could be achieved.

An dry auction game with variable powers that affect future auctions. I think the luck when drawing gold cards is a major factor in winning the game. Theres nothing more frustrating than drawing a set of low cards when you need money the most.

Also, player elimination is a problem since it can happen pretty early.

A bit disappointing.  Tom Lehman created some very good games back in the early 90's.  I regard 2038 as one of the best games ever, and Time Agent nearly as good.  But these were older, longer games.  So when Tom Lehmen came out with a Euro-style boardgame, I had hoped for something wonderful.  In fact the game is perfectly fine.  But there are other auction games I'd prefer to play.

This is a solid strategic bidding game.  The board is two-sided and sectional, allowing for a certain amount of variety of play.  It is particularly commendable that the game actually speeds up as play progresses.

One play.  My one play will likely be my last play.  I just don't care for games in which players can be punished for not making mistakes, as most auction games do.  I suppose the bottom line is: if you like Medici, you'll probably like this game, if you don't, you won't.  Since I dislike Medici, it wasn't surprising I like this game even less.

This game reminds me of Amun-Re in the sense that (as others have also pointed out), the randomness of the deck in drawing cards, is very difficult to overcome.  It overschews what is essentially a game of skill to who draws the best cards has the best chances of winning.

RATING: 4
Not a bad game but neither is it a great game.  Straight up auction with 6 different explorers that manage points or cards slightly differently.  It was just a bit too dry and uninvolved for me and would seem to me that after a bit, the game would be about getting certain combinations and would suffer from lack of replay value.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Some neat ideas here that are offset by odd gameplay and other aspects that didn't seem to make sense. The biggest oddity for me was the purpose of taking an explorer's card when you have already placed your ship in their area.

The other big issue was that down-time was a major factor in the game. If you passed early on bidding, you got to twiddle your thumbs. If you didn't pick up an explorer in the first year, you got to twiddle your thumbs in the second year, which was guaranteed to happen to at least one person in a four player game. Continuing, if you didn't pick up an explorer in the second year, you got to twiddle your thumbs in the third year. Again in a four player game, this is guaranteed to happen to at least two players. These issues are compounded by the fact that bidding continues until everyone passes and that change cannot be made. As such the bidding goes around and around, and is further slowed by the fact that you have to do multiple addition calculations to see what you can even bid. In short, lots of downtime.

The biggest edge I would give [b]Pizarro & Co.[/b] is the modular board. Separating the board into two halves and making each half reversible is inspired and I wish more games could incorporate this somehow. I'm guess our game would have been very different depending on which explorers where available.

[u]Result[/u]: I want to try again, but if I didn't it would be much of a loss.

RATING: 6
A very interesting premise – a special powers auction euro – enhanced by a couple of neat ideas – notably, the way players can only buy explorers they have already bought in each previous round. Unfortunately, it suffers from a conflict between the needs of an auction game and the neat idea.

You see, auction games, with very rare exceptions, work best when more players are competing over each auction (and when auctioned items are worth different amounts to different players, but that's another story). Unfortunately, as the game progresses through the three ages, fewer players are involved in each auction (since more players are unable to stay invested in each explorer), deflating the core activity of the game instead of ratcheting up the tension. That's is a shame, because I love the game conceptually, in particular how your investment in different explorers build different strategies.

The reversible player boards, which result in four possible configurations of explorer powers, are also a very nice concept that do the same thing as a huge deck of special powers cards more elegantly with only a small (practical) cost in replayability.

The monetary system is a bit weird, since you can randomly end up with very little cash even though your strategy revolves around drawing money cards, and it's hard to say if the higher VP values of the smaller cash cards are sufficient compensation, especially in the middle of the game. Strange as it may sound, this is a much smaller issue than the conflicting mechanics, though.

I'd like to see Lehmann take up the ideas in this game again now that he has a lot more design experience under his belt, especially his work on the Saint Petersburg expansion (which is closer in tone to Pizarro than Race for the Galaxy is). Eight years on, I suspect he's good enough to make the cool ideas cohere much better as a complete game.

I was pleasantly surprised by this extensively dumped game. Quite simple 3 level bidding for a number of privileges that can and hopefully bring you a lot of points. 
Plays pretty fast and is quite interactive, since you are always competing with at least one of the players. 

Not bad, but a bit too repetitive to play very often. Can be played as a rather lengthy filler.

Auction games really aren't my favorite.  The randomness of the money cards is what really destroys this one for me, though.  It's too easy for one player to draw 3 or 4 cards and get low numbers and another player to get two cards with high numbers and have a huge advantage.

Fun game where everyone starts with bid cards numbered 1 thru 10, then bid to put boats on an explorer. Only those that have boats on a certain explorer can bid the next round on that same explorer. Games have always involved tense decisons. If there were more strategic depth, I would give it a higher rating. One neat mechanic is that the lower bid cards are worth more VPs at the end of the game.

This was the first German game I ever played, and I hate to admit this, but I didn't care for it at the time. It was all too new, and I was a bit bewildered in our 6-player game (fortunately, we played Tikal right afterward and I was totally hooked!) A later playing with 3 revealed the true nature of the game (it's quite fun!) and it's now got a special place in my heart. It will never be a favorite or a game I want to play too often, but it's a solid effort and will always remind me of that fateful day in the summer of 2002!

This has to be one of the best "auction" games that I have played, thus my 9.5 rating. The special abilities/effects that are available for each of the explorers on both sides of the 2 game boards makes for many different flavors depending on with sides ya'll choose to play with. Nice bits and pieces. Personally I don't like the smaller card size, but this does not detract from the quality of the components. I have not played with less than 4 players and I felt that 5 players was best. The sequence in which the explorers are revealed for bidding can influence the game, but this only adds to highlight the depth of the game mechanics and the special abilities available for each of the explorers for each of the 3 years of the game. Get a copy. You will not be dissapointed.

I've only played with 4 or 5, but with those numbers find that once your path has been set with your first purchase, your options rapidly diminish. This is largely because your investments need to be in complementary explorers. If another player starts following a similar strategy to your own, you're locked in to your strategy already, therefore locked in to high bids, and the game will unfold nicely into the lap of the player which is contested against least. Players just can't afford to bid too high on an explorer they don't really want - they need those bidding cards to complete their own strategy. This compares unfavourably to Ra, where there is much less difference in value to each player for most tile sets.

Licitálós játék, aminek érdekessége a 3 szakasz, és h a második szakaszban már csak az licitál, aki az adott felfedező/hajósra az első szakaszban nyert licitet. Így a játék első szakasza a leghosszabb (18 lap), a második (12), harmadik (6) drasztikusan rövidül. Vigyázni kell, mert rossz licitekkel a játék első részében ki lehet esni, de ez azért kis figyelemmel elkerülhető. Ha a második részben esik ki vki - erre azért van esély, akkor már nem kell sokat várnia, a 3. szakasz max 10 perces. Jó ötlet még a táblák A/B oldala, ezek kombinálásával több "pálya" rakható ki, játszható.

I am divided about this game.  I really want to like this it, but it always leaves me frustrated.  The core auction mechanic is interesting, although it almost guarantees that some players are locked out of winning well before the end of the game.  Also, multiple auctions where different subsets of players are competing creates a lot of kingmaking-like situations, or at a minimum situations where the key outcomes (how much two other players fight) is completely beyond your control.

The only thing you do the whole game through is bidding for cards (famous explorers). Although this sounds not very exciting I have to mention that the game is not the worst. It's an ok one … perhaps even on the edge of good games.

learned this at my first boardgaming event in 2010. I was targetting the explorers who provided cards and/or card manipulation more than set victory points and it seemed to pay off. I had significantly more cards than anyone else near the end of the game and therefore, had little competition in the auctions.

When I started my first game of Pizarro & Co I was worried that there was not much to it. I mean, the mechanics of the auctions are ultra-simple. However, I quickly discovered that there are hidden depths. Because each explorer has different special abilities and values, the explorers you choose in the first round determine how well you do overall. Without a strategic combination of explorers, you are doomed. I lost both games I played, and still had a great time--that's the mark of an excellent game in my book.

Great to have a six player Euro that doesn't take forever to play.

Nice and quick, and looks like it will have good replay value due to the modular board and different paths to victory. Might be a tad heavy as a 6P gateway game tho'. I prefer this with less players, maybe 3 or 4 would be best.

With the full 6 it's still fun, but the bidding is less intense as some players get locked out of particular tracks.

Magellan seems to be the winning strategy, so bid him up!

This one has gone up in my ratings - started at a 6. If you like auction games then this is about as good as it gets. There's none of the dud player spoiling the game problem with Modern Art and the auctions go by faster too. After a few playings we average about 30 minutes. The trick is in bidding for the right combination of explorers, but the draw of the explorer and money cards can force you to tweak the best laid plans. You'll have to keep an eye on what the other players are doing too - perhaps bluff them into paying a little more than they can afford. Quick, fun, easy to learn and teach, lots of tough decisions. A very good game - especially for the price.

OK, this is an auction game.  And it's not very subtle about it.  That's not a bad thing, and the decisions are interesting.  I just think that the fun is somewhat lacking at times.

RATING: 8
Bidding game.  Cut-throat bidding game.  Dual-sided game boards make this a &quot;4-in-1&quot; product, sort of.  Gameplay emphasizes early rounds more than most games, and the four variations make this game quite replayable.

RATING: 5
simplistic, solvable, repetitive game.  Not much good with more than 4 players.  Much more difficult to analyze with 3 players since you end up with more explorers.  Even so it is fairly easy to just sit down and assign values to each explorer depending on the number of players at which point the game just plays itself.

However if you play in a group that doesn't analyze games in this way this game deserves a higher rating for you.

This deserves another play before final analysis, but the general opinion of the group from our first play was that it was entirely broken. Problems included: pure auction play which quickly got old; limiting system for additional auctions made game boring & pointless for most players; and intricate calculations required to determine "value" of any auction greatly reduced enjoyment factor.

RATING: 7
A very competent auction game that involves acquiring explorers whose abilities are activated throughout the course of the game.

The different abilities allow a variety of strategies. Money is fairly tight especially near end game. The 4 different board sides allows for more variety.

The randomness of the money draw does irk me a little. The scoring track is crap.

I like how this game plays out.  My one problem is that it takes at least one game to "get" the ramifications of the different powers of the explorers.

Possible lunch game, best with 4-6.

Update: great auction game, we enjoy it quite a bit at work, especially since the sweet spot seems to be 4-6. We tried 3p once and it works, but the feel just isn't as good.

As in most auction games it definitely benefits from multiple plays.

This seems really underrated to me (at 6.6) - not sure why people don't like it as much as other games in the genre. This one has more replayability than most due to the double-sided explorer board.

RATING: 8
Well, first of all, I like auction games, because of that I own way too many of them.  This makes me especially hard on the games that don't make the grade.  After playing Pizzaro & Co. the other auction games are going to have a tough time standing up to the competition.  

The addition of variable powers in the mechanics, really make this a gem.  Lots of tough decisions.  The card play makes YOU'RE BLUFFING! worthless as this takes that game's mechanics and fleshes them out.

Highly recommend it!

UPDATE: I really loved this when it came out, but then it fell on the wayside unplayed for years. I've played a number of games since this came out that are just stellar and by comparison this just isn't as good.  With that said, it is still a great game, it is unlike most other auction game, it forces tough choices, it has a great sense of hand management, and the way that the auctions come up are just fun and can be exciting.  There is certainly some luck of the draw both in the order of auctions and absolutely in the money cards, but I don't feel that it makes the game any less intriguing. I downgraded it from a 9 to an 8 only because I just didn't feel like playing it for so long.

As a fan of auction games, I have to say that this is among the worst.  While it would seem that having fewer explorers each round would raise the tension, it only had the effect of eliminating players and making the auctions in fact less tense and less interesting.

Ow, my brain hurts! Good game (I think),  but I tend to do poorly in these auction games. After another recent play (5/05), I'm bumping this to a 7 - it's a good auction game, and I do suck at it.

I loved it from the first minute of my first game.  The auctions are so tense, then they're killer as the game progresses.  There are several paths to victory (I just need to discover them) and I also like the two different boards to mix things up.  A great game.

Played once, I can see the appeal for some people,  it's lite, easy, and quick to play.  I however found it uninteresting lacking the "it" factor.  For some reason this seemingly simple game seems unbalanced, despite it being an auction game. I love auction games,  but just can't see playing this when there are litterally dozens of better auction games.  This is comperable to Medici, but Medici is twice the game of Pizarro & Co.

This game really didn't thrill me.  The theme is very weak and there is a little bit of fiddleyness with regard to having to keep track of who starts each bidding round.  The game is kind of a cross between a production game and a bidding game.  Strategy is a bit opaque and playing well requires a good understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of each of the explorers so newbies are not likely to do well.  Also, there's really nothing new here.  I've seen this kind of thing done before (and done better).  It's not a bad game and I can see why some like it but I thought it was only so-so.

This game felt a bit like Ra, but it was way more restrictive in that players basically got eliminated from bidding after successive rounds.  It's a tough little game, but I like the way it played.  Perhaps it's a bit vanilla, but the mechanisms were sound and the length was right.

Played a German copy called Magellan.

In my opinion, far better than Ra, and somewhat better than Medici. This comes down to the different abilities of each explorer you are bidding for, and the way you choose your path to victory. Assigning the gold cards a victory points value inverse to their monetary value is a terrific idea. This games plays fast, but there is a great deal to do on the way.

Lots of auctions, but which ones do you commit to is the question, and it's a tough one. We played a 5-player game in about 45 minutes, and it could easily be less as we become more familiar with each explorer's special abilities. A lot of game packed into a short timespan-kind of reminds me of Web of Power in this regard.

I had no problem with the game but the group just shrugged after one play. Would give it another chance but most likely will not. Too many games, not enough time.

What's that you say?  A game about exploration?  Well, don't know that I'm so crazy about the title, what with the glorifying one of the great villains of history, but I like exploration games.  Wait, you say there's no exploration, but that we're royalty bidding on voyages?  We're bidding on WHOSE voyages?  The same James Cook who explored 250 years after Pizarro?  AND Marco Polo, who explored 250 years before?  What kinda crackpot 500-year-old monarch am I?  And why are the auctions for them interspersed?  Jeez, at least they have special powers.  What's this hand mean on Columbus, the most famous explorer in history, he who opened up the New World to European exploration?  Wait, what?  You mean that the only thing I get to do is to delay an auction?

Oh! How much better this game would be if the spread of card values were tightened up. As is you draw money cards randomly, and their value varies from 1-9. The fact that the lower cards are worth more VP if you don't use them doesn't even begin to make up for their lesser buying power during the game. If the values were at least 1-6, I think the game would be better, or maybe the card system altogether needs fixing. Other than this disconcerting flaw there is a lot to like here- it could have been THE 60 min. game for six players.

Challenging, interesting auction game.  Very difficult to play with players of widely differing experience with the game, though.  The short- and long-term implications of each auction are really interesting to sort out.

But as with Phoenicia, there isn't enough variability. I appreciate the attempt with the board, but it would be much better to have sets of cards (or tiles) that would create the tableau, rather than one of four "fixed" tableaus.

Considering I'm not a fan of the mechanic, auction games have to be very special in order for me to like it.  Unfortunately, this is not one of them.  Pizarro & Co. is so dependent on luck it's not even funny.  Since the cards you draw basically determine your ability to compete in the bidding, there is very little you can do if other people get more and better ones than you do.  What makes it even worse is that if you don't manage to win at least one explorer in round 2, you are basically out of the game because you cannot participate in the last round.

Further compounding the problem is how fragile the gameplay is directly affected by player's competence.  If someone doesn't bid aggressively enough or makes a blunder against a mutual opponent in a given auction, that could very well screw you by leaving him enough cards to win over you.  This could then set off a cascading chain in which the person already behind just isn't going to recover while the rich get richer.

The ideas are good, but the strategy seems to be left up to chance more often than not.

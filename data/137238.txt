Unfortunately, this fell short and the gameplay was a bit dry.  It was fun to try and move/trade/beam/produce items, but ultimately was not that fun.

The timer mechanic in this game was very interesting and required you to think about things, however in the end its all about efficiency and getting your orders out else the other stuff you collected is meaningless.

So eh on the game, but I like the mechanics.

Great game - been really enjoying this and it's up to about 10 plays. Not just unique, but also great and well-executed. Nice tempo, as things start out pretty leisurely but escalate as the game goes on.

Top tips:
- Get demand chits out early. You need to clear out your backlog, and keeping the economy churning a little bit even early in the game is to your advantage, you can see how things develop and dribbling out demands is better than making a big push late, when it will overwhelm your station.
- Do spend the first 10 minutes or so focussing primarily on upgrading your station. Do a few deliveries - you need a wild 3 - but focus on the station. You *must* have a demand generator; don't pass one up. Next is probably a better beaming station, followed by upgraded production. But you need all of it.
- You need to watch and talk with your neighbors. They need to clear demands too, so let them know what you're producing and coordinate.
- Keep your options open until the late game (last 8-10 minutes). Try to get as many colors at 2x or 3x as you can so you can make a big later push to maximize your score. Don't try to score all 3 colors though, try to write one off early based on what people are producing (which will tend to drive demand).
---
Vast improvement over Space Dealer, this is a fun and fast game that provides a bunch of interesting challenges and is also far more interactive than the original - the need to keep talking to your neighbors and keep the right contracts and goods flowing is a big deal and really helps make the game more than just a game of timed optimization, as the original was.

Space Dealer was a great concept that didn't really work. Time 'n' Space takes the concept and finally makes a really good game out of it.

I was pleased at how well the game worked with 3, but 4 is still probably ideal. Still, there aren't a ton of great 3 player games, so the fact that it works quite well with 3 is a win.

So I spend some time learning this game because I was having a game night with a couple of teens and another adult. I figured it out, but wasn't able to really play by myself. Of course. When they came over, I explained it to them as best I could. Summing up every step in producing Goods sending goods and accepting Goods. I told them how the time was work and how the tiles work. These are not dumb people. But man oh Pete, they did not get it. And when I started the timer, they were so completely lost that I had to stand there telling them each what they should do for the first five or 10 minutes. And after that they were still just staring at empty timers and putting the timers in the wrong places and just making a mess of it. So I would say that this is a very super chaotic messy and confusing game. Even for myself, it was hard to remember what I was doing when I set a timer. I'd see it empty timer and wonder if I had already done the action or not. It was kind of crazy. And I kept forgetting to set my timer. So unless you have people who are used to games like this, I would say this is a fail with a new crowd of Gamers who aren't into complex games.

RATING: 7
Negotiation game involving sand timers that allows you to use the action it is placed once the timer is finished. You have a 30 minute limit and can be chaotic. Requires a bit of experience before the game will show its true strength.

RATING: 4
Looks fun but is actually quite a dry and abstract game. Travelling to other planets is costly in terms of time so I can't see why you wouldn't simply visit each planet once when each planet has sufficient orders. If you produce orders and no one comes to your planet, you are going to do really badly. Overall not really an improvement over Space Dealer.

Very nice re-implementation of Space Dealer. After 4 plays, the teaching game is no longer of much interest, but the full game remains nicely intriguing. I probably enjoy this at about a 7, but I'll give it an extra .5 for using such an awesome mechanic.

Some have said that if nobody visits your planet, you'll have trouble. This is true, but: (a) visiting your planet is in all players' best interests, especially while the bonus token is still there; (b) you will have trouble in *any* trading game if everybody decides not to trade with you; and (c) I suspect that there are strategy paths (involving teching up) which can be followed in reaction to nobody heading your way which will help compensate.

After another play or two: Hmm. The mechanics are [b]way[/b] more solid than Space Dealer's ever were, but it also feels much drier and more mechanical... and this is something of an experience game. Too bad.

There aren't many unique games out there, and this is one of them. It's a very different feel. It's not frantic, but it's very short. The game itself is simple, but it's easy to forget to do something, and get your timing off. Fun game, though.

Only played the 12-minute learning game so far. Wow, this is something else. The game is in real time and it's not simple.

Definitely will have to play this more and check out the full 30 minute version.

If you have analysis paralysis prone people in your game group that go on your nerve from time to time, this is the game to pay them back. And hey, maybe they even learn to play faster.

The basic concept behind Time'n'Space is great. It's a real-time game but for once that doesn't mean speed game. It simply means that the game runs a fixed length of time (30 minutes in the full game) and each action you take requires 1 minute to complete. You can only have a maximum of two actions in progress at any time so while there's often a flurry of frantic activity when actions complete there are also stretches of time where you are mostly waiting on your running actions to finish. This time can be used to ponder what to do next or negotiate orders with your fellow space truckers.

Unfortunately, the game behind this concept does not quite live up to the promise of that concept. It is, frankly, too simple. Produce goods, deliver them to a planet that wants them, repeat. In between there's a little bit of technological advancement (but that, too, is all uniform and unexciting) and at the end there is an unnecessary obnoxious scoring system. They needed an incentive for players to bring their contracts into play but tying it to the soring like this just feels wrong. Really a missed opportunity, but I look forward to seeing other games that try to implement this mechanism in other surroundings.

RATING: 7
Lots of interesting elements coincide to make this game work. The abstruse scoring system corrals negotiation, as some goods will simply fall by the wayside based upon the demand and goods other players choose to produce. Since fulfilling multiple players' demands gives score multipliers, exclusive trade-pacts are impossible to form (even ignoring the downtime players have traveling for the sake of upgrades).
Real-time games often suffer for allowing loud or fast players to dominate discussions, but because the sand-timers create a natural delay in player actions, the game allows all players time to breathe and think.

The game is unfortunately one-note throughout for its sheer simplicity (scoring aside).

Played once...  I'm not sure that it is the replacement for Space Dealer that I had hoped for...  Yes, the objectives of less fiddly/reduced start up time and a greater emphasis on player negotiation have been met, but at the expense of "base building" fun and with slightly less obvious demand/supply status of each player.  Needs another couple of plays!

Well, it's definitely not as scary as some other real-time games (Space Alert, anyone?), but there's at least some franticness here as you try to figure out what everyone else is doing and what you can do yourself. I've still yet to be a fan of a real-time game. (1 play)

Pick up and deliver with a twist...the components are cool for how simple they are and the board looks cool. The timing mechanism is unique, the two timers and flipping mechanic is brilliant! The scoring mechanism encourages trading with all players while having to focus on your own production facilities at the same time. An excellent way to make a pick up and deliver game feel different.

Heaviest "filler" I've played. Quite unique and a lot of fun. After the first game, my group said they didn't like it and thought it was broken. I'm so glad we gave it another chance! We all loved it and tripled or quadrupled our score. There are some great strategies to develop. The time between timers is so exciting as you line up a several action combo. Wow. So cool.

It's a very, very interesting game (unlike any I've ever played). I love the mechanics of the sand timers and station upgrades, but I dislike the rules about putting out orders in order to score points for a particular good - it ends up causing very low-scoring games.

I feel like there is an amazing game in here with just a few rule tweaks; I may experiment with it in the future.

Cool concept, but I'm not a fan of speed games.  This is sort of a slow-motion speed game.  You set the timers and then wait.  When they run out, you have to hurry up and do the next thing, set the timers again and then go back to waiting.  Try to be in the right place at the right time.

This game is FUN. It's a real time game that ends when the 30 minute timer runs out. You have to wait for one of your two sand timers to run out in order to take an action, so you're in a hurry, but you actually have time to breathe and think. Definitely worth checking out.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (November 2014)

When I read the rules I thought the game was going to be great. When I played it, I enjoyed it but I was somewhat disappointed. I really like the sand timers and I have never played a game like this one (thus the high rating), however I feel the game itself is very light and the scoring system is weird (and has issues?). There is almost no motivation to sell all four kinds of products as that vastly improves your opponents score, the only one I could think of is to mutually negotiate with a rival so both players produce what the other needs. In general you only want to sell the two kinds of products you yourself are buying in other planets, otherwise you will benefit another player and with a 30 minute game, you won’t be able to take full advantage of the three kind of products. It is a no brainer for me to do this and this is a minus because it seems the score system is flawed. Moreover it doesn’t make any thematic sense. However I did enjoy the timers mechanism (real time, no turn order), it is unique.
 
Another great virtue of the game is the predefined and short play time (30 minutes). Great components. Best with 4 players.

It is very easy for a player to cheat (intentionally or unintentionally) in this game.

Bottom line, I currently enjoy the game, but I feel that with more plays the game´s rating will begin to fall. It is way too simple for my taste. It is very sad as the basic concept behind the game is brilliant, I would love to play a heavier game with timers so I will try Space Dealer soon. (I own the game, I only need the time to learn and play it). I also feel the game has a low replayability factor.

As I feared, Time 'n' Space doesn’t have the legs to be an ok game for me, now I consider it a mediocre game. I still would play if requested, but my desire to play it again is very low. It is a shame because the game is  very novel with the timers, but it is also too light for me. I sold my copy of the game.

Time'n'Space is proof that I'm getting too old for real-time games. This is stress, not fun. Although in between it might even have phases of boredom when there's nothing to do than waiting for your sand timers to run out.
The trading element is not as interesting as I hoped for. The strategy is obvious: concentrate on two different trade goods and try to get these from all other players. Ignore the rest. The potential for deliberate 'mistakes' is annoying in a competitive game.
Average at best, my hopes for a better game were disappointed.

This is a MUCH better implementation of Space Dealer, correcting most of the major and minor problems. Players are properly incentivized to both trade for and from colors. The choices remain interesting. The game itself is streamlined and plays well. Although the first couple minutes are a little slow, the game picks up quickly enough.

It's not the best realtime game ever made, but it's certainly worth a play, especially for the easy initial learning curve.

Pick up and delivery game with a timed mechanic as sand times control actions through the game.  

Time 'N' Space is a real-time, action-selection, production management, pickup-and-deliver game for 3-4 players that plays in exactly 30 minutes. In that time, you must produce goods and manage as many deliveries as possible to fulfill the demands on planets, while the other players are trying to do the same thing.

I rate this only a 3.  Disappointed by this and I'd rather just play Space Dealer.  It's more of an exercise rather than competitive game play, in my opinion.  It's more like a negotiated "non-coopertative" puzzle where you don't let opponents win.  

I also usually dislike most real-time games so that also plays a part in my rating.  If you like real-time games, please disregard my opinions on this genre.

Textbook case of a supersolid reworking of a previous game (Space Dealer). It gets rid of "cool stuff" that didn't quite work (complex tech tree for building up your station) in favor of making it a more interesting game (demand generation is now player-managed instead of automatic; pick-up and deliver is nicely abstracted to make it less fiddly and failure-prone). 

Great package overall, I even like the new art.

---Preliminary thoughts---

I did not read the full rules and I still have to play it, but the sandtimes mechanic looks cool.

If the timers measure 2 minutes, that means there will be around 14 turns per player. That also means you have 2 "free" minutes you can delay. the penalty for an excess of slack could be having 13 turns instead of 14, and that is not a huge penalty, especially if you make up for it by being more careful with the extra thinking time you get.

Also, you might depend too much on wheter the other players want to trade with you or not.

I'm also concerned about the possiblity of planning the games beforehand.

Looking forward to play! *and will buy if I find it cheap enough.

Most probably I will change my rating then.

This is a real-time pick-up-and-deliver game that doesn't feel that frantic.  Rather, it has a more "hurry up and wait" vibe--you can't do anything while your sand timers are still running.  It does involve a lot of multiplayer chaos, as what your opponents do has a drastic effect on what you can do, especially if they do something like make the delivery you were going for right before you do.  I don't really like real-time games, and while this wasn't as frantic as some, it still really didn't do anything for me.

Very hectic and confusing game. The real time aspect is very interesting, but may lead to people bartering very loudly, which may turn quieter players off. It seems quite effective that two people collude and always deliver goods to each other, blocking other players out completely. I cannot understand the design decision to put the order tokens directly on the player board, such that it is very hard to see what other players demand. This leads to even more loud talking. In the end, if others player ignore you for a while, the contracts block your productivity and will most likely not score any points. I also think that four different goods are too much, since you need to sell the same as what you deliver/produce, to score points well. If in the beginning you happen to produce and ask for goods that nobody asks for, you are pretty much skrewed.

Works better with four than with three (closer planets), and works much, much, much better once everyone figures out it's really a deal making game. If deals aren't being made then it'll slow down the pace of the game and result in blockages, waiting and boredom. With deals however it turns into a lively and hectic game of activity and races and cursing and fun. I've seen it played both ways and usually it bombs a bit on the first play and then if it's given a second chance it's a lot of fun.

Definitely room for this in the collection. No turn order. Easier rules than Space Dealer. Not sure which is better though - Space Dealer worked better with three players, had a bit more complexity and enabled extra timers to be brought into play.

RATING: 8
Another one of those games in which I am baffled as to why the average rating is relatively low on the BGG - very underrated.

This is one of the most unique gaming experiences I have ever had - a kinetic blend of real-time play, technology tree development, engine building, pick-up-and-deliver, resource management, negotiation, and trade that plays entirely in 30 minutes.

I suppose the only minor quibble I had is that some had difficulty grasping the mechanics - though they are rather simple, the way they integrate is atypical - so you pretty much need to play twice to get an understanding of the game.

This is one of those games with a novel, really great sounding idea that, for me at least, just doesn't work well in practice.

The game is played by using 1 minute sand timers to set the timer for an action such as moving or generating a good.  When the timer is up you take that action and set the timer for a new action.  While you are waiting for your two timers to finish you are supposed to be wheeling and dealing with your opponents to get rid of your orders and convince them to make the right orders available.  This is because scoring is done not only by fulfilling your opponents orders but each player needs to clear their cache of an order of a specific type in order to score that type.

The game is also timed at 30 minutes so with 2 sand timers each player can do a maximum of 60 actions.  Realistically that number is quite a few less because nobody can take their action and restart their timers without down time and there are often situations where you want to delay a timer or are caught up thinking about something.

I think the time set by this game is just about right.  You have enough actions that you could probably clear half of your order types (2 of 4) and complete a few orders of those types from opponents before time ends.  The actual mechanic of needing to clear an order type from your own supply is a little wonky though.  It works well enough but doesn't make for an elegant game in my opinion.

Past that there just isn't much here.  It is pickup and deliver boiled down to it's bare minimum with a neat little gimmick to make up the difference.  Hell, it isn't even pickup and deliver.  It's produce and deliver.  I would much rather play something like Galaxy Trucker which doesn't play much longer and I feel has a lot more going, uses real time mechanics better, and is simply a lot more fun.

[2013-02-14] Also I love space-themed economy games, I am very unsure if I would like the time pressure, I usually don't.

Real time game of building technologies and trading goods. There's a lot of game in a half hour of play here! The timer system is very clever and is a lot of fun to play with. The mechanics are almost entirely improved from Space Dealer; the game plays more smoothly and is more dynamic. However, Space Dealer was prettier and had more variety of tech cards.

The first 90 seconds of Time 'n' Space is odd; you rush like crazy to set everything up and then there's a minute long pause while everything runs through. Then there's a mad rush to change everything over again followed by a pause...

It's an odd system but as things start to get out of sequence with each other the game picks up. At its heart it's a very simple pick up and deliver game, though the pick up aspect can be done a little out of turn sequence and the game requires a little more co-operation and timing between players.

We've only played the original 12 minute game but I'm keen to dig further and see what else the game offers.

Update: Having now also tried the 30 minute full game, I can say that I like this. It is still odd having those minute long pauses between turns, but in theory you should be negotiating with other players, planning your turns and keeping an eye on the overall game time. Interesting...

Intense timed semi-coöperation game. It plays in 30 minutes and is both easy and involving.

Interesting new mechanics. The fixed time to finish is a bonnus and you play the full lenght of the match, feels like no down time at all.

Interestingly different, timed, pick up and deliver, trading game, but I am not sure the trading/scoring holds up to closer scrutiny.

The timed actions system is very novel, but ultimately the game plays very chaoticly. Hard to get people interested to play just because its so different from conventional games.

I've only played once, but I'm not entirely sure how this is supposed to be enjoyable, even when you succeed. Happy to see it run properly if we didn't quite do it right, but nothing happens during downtime and while folks make half-hearted attempts to negotiate deals, ultimately players can only plan two, perhaps three actions ahead, then are deadlocked once they commit. Then there are instances of tedious waiting punctuating all the actual actions.

I'm very happy to concede that at this point, I don't get it.

Different alien races exploring the small galaxy board. Simultaneous timed play to produce goods and manage deliveries through frantic negotiations with the other player races. I do not get the coordination of the two sand timers (I still don't know how to use the three seashells). Hard for me to grasp the scoring objective.  There is ZERO PERCENT chance I can; 1) teach this to my group 2) have them understand it 3) not have them beat me near death with the components if I got them to play. This is probably an amazing game and I'm just missing it.

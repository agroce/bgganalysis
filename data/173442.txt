Woohaaa! I liked the game the first time i saw it on kickstarter, i loved the first play of it. I've even startet to paint miniatures because of it... Still a looong way to go, but in the meantime i hope to get this one to the table more often.
Really like the workerplacement here ant the specialists you can train. Like the combat options, without making it a combat game. Very cool mix! Great components!

A good worker placement game for sure, but having played the original version a number of enjoyable times, at this point I have come to find the tiles to be a bit overpowered in their ability to decide each game.  In particular, the game seems to come down to who will get the correct tile, at the correct time, in order to win the game.

There is a lot to like about this reprinting. First, the components are high quality, gorgeous, and functional. Furthermore, the worker-placement mechanic is simple, fluid, and manages to create some tough decisions. And because of the engine-building elements and scoring mechanics, the game rewards long term planning. 

But, overall... this game overstays its welcome. Much of my angst with the game comes with the luck factors, which mitigates some of the tough decisions during the worker placement phase. Obviously, there is luck in colonization, which could mitigate several of your actions. But I also found the capital buildings to be quite swinging despite the ability to manipulate turn order; and that's because players have no knowledge about what buildings may come out, and their usefulness varies. Furthermore, this game is quite interactive and has fairly obtuse scoring, which can lead to situations of players wrongly identifying the strongest player to attack. 

That being said, I see the appeal in this game. But as games get longer (especially past the 2-hour mark) I expect the luck element to be reduced. This game simply isn't for me.

Great game.  Super fun.  For me this game is similar to Dominant Species but way more enjoyable, a lot less chaotic, and plays much quicker.

A nice mix of area control and worker placement with a lavish new production.  The new version is a little pricey but I'm glad to own such a nice production of this one.

Worker placement but loosely thematic (soldiers can destroy opponents dudes, merchants can produce wealth).

2015 deluxe AoE III.

BGGer johnclark says: I rated the original game 9.2 - it is one of my very favourite games. Everything Drover added to the game since then has made the game worse, sometimes much worse. The builder, the additional buildings , the nation powers, buying points etc. Not only are these unnecessary, they turn an excellent game into a silly game. Drover should know better than to include targeted actions, which were not in the base game. I give this edition a score of 8 because the base game is in there, so you can still play it , but the horror of the additional stuff makes me mad. The new board design is functionally better but looks worse - I am happy to play with either board. I don't mind the rule tweaks to (a) see the Age 3 buildings at the start and (b) reduce the risks associated with discovery (note that this is what was needed to make discovery a viable option, not some silly building which gives more points for discoveries). The rule tweaks obviously can be used with the original game.

Oh, why don't I like this game. It's right up my boxes and ticks all the alleys, but the mix of all elements has to be just right. This one is too tedious. Have one or two AP guys in your group and this game just draaaaags on. There are other games where I can get the same satisfaction in less time.

Pretty metal coins though. Playing with them pulled me through the boring parts.

I just received my copies. They were waiting for me when I returned from Gen Con.

All I can say is 'WOW!'

The box is bigger than the original, and HEAVY!
And the weight is due to the massive amount of high-quality material in there. The tiles are big and chunky (I love these). the metal coins are even nicer than I expected. The player mats are made of some material that seems indestructible. The new board very high quality and is two-sided, with the World Map on the back side. The deep-insert plastic storage tray is very nice. There is also a scoring mat and a scoring pad, so the players can use either.

This is a very, very nice production and I am thrilled to have my copies.

Well done Eagle!

10x10 2017.  This game combines several mechanics- primarily worker placement and area control, but also some set collection.  This is a big game in a huge box with tons of plastic pieces and it has an epic feel.  But at the same time it's a rather slick euro design that's easy to teach and learn.  Plays pretty quickly, again given it's epic feel.  Our games tended to be very close and there was always a lot of suspense during final scoring.  Great game and well worth the price and space.

This is a reincarnation of Age of Empires III.  Cool components, nice board, but it's still a worker placement game, albeit a pretty good one.  Seems a little long, but maybe that was because we had 5 players, 3 of whom were new to the game and one with ap issues.  Also, hard to play the first time since you don't know what the cards are that might come out and screw your plans.

6/11/16: Very smooth worker placement/area majority game set during the discovery of the new world. Although a 6 player game took 3.5 hrs,  the game is quite fun.  This was the retail copy and as usual with Eagle/Griffon,  the game materials were wonderfully overproduced(tons of plastic minis,  3mm thick cardboard tiles,  linen finished cards, game board and box!).  Quite the feeling of getting your money's worth.

Worker placement, special unit roles/powers, and area control. This game is my #1. This edition is a bit over priced/over-produced, and it was a cheap ploy that the game pieces for the second map that comes in the box have to be purchased separately (it is one sheet of punch-out chits). But, the game is absolutely worth owning and I'll never be sad that I don't play the other map. You aren't moving across the map so it doesn't seem to add much.

I really wish they had put a tighter 2-3 player board on the back instead of the alternative map that's useless without buying extra components.

 Having played games for over 50 years this still sits

 It takes parts of everything I love in games and mixes it into a satisfying tense experience. The sense of
accomplishment I feel as I see my empire expand and evolve fills me with awe.
 This game tells a grand story of conquest and exploration that transports me back in time to a period
where the world was still filled with wonder.
 I have supported this kickstarter project so that both

Empires: Age of Discovery allows you to revisit the age of exploration and discovery. Take on the role of a colonial power seeking fame, glory, and riches in the New World. As you proceed through three ages, you launch expeditions of discovery, colonize regions, expand your merchant fleet, build capital buildings that give your nation distinct advantages, develop your economy, and (if necessary) declare war. It is a re-implementation of Age of Empires III but without that name due to the expense of renewing the license from Microsoft. This edition includes the Empires: Builder Expansion along with its capital buildings; its National Advantage tiles have been built into the new player boards.

[January 2018 - 8.9]
There's a little bit of everything in this game (area control, push-your-luck, set collection, worker placement and engine/economy building), yet, it all works together without being overly complex or out of theme. All those avenues provide good decision moments throughout the game -- not just the decision for where you place your workers (therefore giving up on other tracks), but the pros/cons presented within each of the avenues.

Eg... 
>> Go for turn-order initiative --> get less money the earlier you go. 
>> Commit a ton of workers to ensure a successful discovery --> lose all but one of those workers (a colonist) when taking the region.
>> Conduct Battle/Warfare --> Other players may bring in soldiers to counterattack via the Colonist Dock before the battle gets started. 

There are hints of El Grande and Dominant Species on a lighter level (two of my most favorite games), so I've really enjoyed it.

I really like the different type of workers and how each one provides a special ability. It's not a new concept, but well executed.

The Capital Buildings at times felt a little over-powerful or "take that," but with more plays everyone should know what could be coming down the pipeline.

Honestly, I'm not sure this one is worth the extra money...at least to me.  I really Age of Empires III, so I'm rating it the same.  What I like better in this one:  coins, more capital buildings, builders (I think), discovery tiles, cheat sheets.  What I like less in this one: Nations benefits and more "hose someoene" capital buildings.  Most of these are minor improvements/quibbles.  The nation benefits are just not my cup of tea.  Others may like them.  Just too much of "take that".  They can be really devastating to a player as the nation will unleash the benefit (often a one or 2 time thing) at the most critical time for the biggest swing.    The game is still great though and it is easy to leave them out!

Players play a country, colonising the Americas and discovering new lands.  Players take turns allocating colonists in Caylus fashion to specific roles for the upcoming turn.  Then the roles are resolved - colonies spring up, trade goods, merchant shipping, capital infrastructure, discover new lands, etc.  It's all in the quest for victory points and these are earned via region majorities at three points during the game, discoveries, trade income and infrastructure value.  Nice game, very balanced, with a sense of escalating tension as it moves towards a conclusion.  Lots of ideas borrowed from other games, but the theming, engrossing, interactive game play, and a sensible time limit cap earns this one a spot in the collection.  

This is the new edition, with deluxe pieces, nine factions (with powers) and the Builders expansion included.  A beautiful game, just a smidgeon behind Tribune as the best worker placement game out there.

RATING: 8
This game is an insanely over-produced piece of work.  There was a lot of love put into it, no doubt, but the rating is based on the merits of the game itself.  I would drop this 2 points simply because the price of entry is not worth its weight in value (imo, of course).  I mention this because typically my ratings also consider components; in this case, I am not considering the components at all.

With that out of the way, let's move onto the game itself.  I never played the original Microsoft-licensed game (AOE3) and was always curious about how they translated the PC RTS game into a boardgame form - turns out that the association is pretty loose.  Thankfully, Empires doesn't suffer for it because the license is no longer attached and it can stand on its own, so I won't be making comparisons.

Empires: Age of Discovery (EAD) is a surprisingly-engaging worker placement game (my least favorite genre) crossed with area-majority (one of my favorites).  Players represent ancient nations or states -each with their own unique ability -  trying to settle the new world (kudos to my friend who worked on the game for not only writing an excellent rulebook, but for also doing the research on historically-accurate flags - nice touch) in spite of one another.  To do this, there are several action spaces that run down the right side of the board that represent various actions from sending settlers to grabbing trade goods to all-out warfare.  These action spaces will then resolve in order after everyone has placed all of their available workers for the turn, introducing an excellent layer of timing-based strategy.  Moreover, the workers aren't just plain old nameless cubes; there are several distinct worker types that all provide a different function depending on where you place them.  For example, a merchant can net you some money if he settles the new world or he can count as 2 pieces if you send him to buy up a ship instead (one ship available, majority wins).  Another example is the builder, who can provide a nice discount when you want to pick up a rule-bending building for your empire or a hefty income bonus if he's in the new world, provided you actually win the majority wherever a builder may be present.

The catch, then, is that specialized workers aren't easy to come by, and neither is money, for all that matter.  The only way to mitigate the vanilla start-up is to build your empire, which essentially means building a machine.  Doing this isn't exactly a walk in the park, either, as the components for your machine (buildings, trade goods, etc) are all highly-desired by other folks at the table.  The end result is a gut-wrenching decision tree typical of timing-based worker placement games.  If you go to one space, you get first pick of what you want, but ultimately at the potential cost of losing an opportunity elsewhere.  You can feel the tension when you know the guy next to you has a solid plan in his head and is desperately hoping that nobody picks a space to get a contested resource first or lock him out of the space entirely.

With that in mind, EAD is not for the AP-prone.  The game by its very nature runs a few hours and if you throw in some AP-people, you're going to regret it.  On any given turn, your decision tree could be anywhere from two to five choices and the game does an amazing job of pulling you in every direction.  If highly-competitive people are at the table, this game has the potential to be incredibly tense.  Thankfully, my table was filled with 80s tunes, funny accents, and trash talk (not typical of this game).

This is a fantastic, solid design and I enjoyed it very much.  If they made a non-shiny edition, I would go nab it up right away.  It's not every day I come across a Euro I want to own, so that makes EAD pretty special in my book.

AoE is a great game! One of the simpler, direct and more intuitive Worker Placement games that I have played. Great pieces and a well balanced Euro. There is enough variety in the Discovery cards and Capital Buildings that keeps this game fresh. Turns go fast, which is a nice plus to this one. This game really capitalizes on easy play but tough decisions throughout. A solid WP game!

The Deluxe edition is 90% a component-deluxe edition, with new art, thicker tiles, revised rules, among other things. The best new additions here is the Builders expansion (now part of the base game) and the all-new National Powers, which adds one more element to the game but one I really enjoy. Great stuff here!

RATING: 7
Played one time with 6. Great group of players made turns quick and the game flow with many interesting strategies tried. 

All the mechanisms worked well together. But it feels like I have played the game before. It felt a bit old. Gather trade goods, get 3 of a kind to get more income....I feel like it has been used too many times. 

It has alot of take that. In many not so fun ways. 

Many random events that has a big impact on the outcome. If you take first place to buy a building first you dont know what will show up. It will probably be something good, but you dont know. And when you know and spend first action taking it, someone use a special power to build it. 

Area control has a big risk of analysis paralysis. It did not happen that much to us but for this alone I cannot play it with my friends. 

I liked an action where you spent your worker to get a better worker next time. And using it in combinations with building resulted in nice combos. 

Buildings felt too good especially compared to trade goods. And area control is not my favourite mechanism. Even if combat was minimal here. 

Liked the theme, and liked playing it but when I reflect upon it I dislike lots of the parts in the game. It was probably the best play session with 6 players in a meaty game I have played, but I think it was more thanks to the group then the game. 

I would like to play it again, but I can think of a bunch of games I would rather play...but meaty game with six gamers I dont know of any better game to play.

I enjoy the worker placement aspect of this game, it's a lot like dominate species which I love. The theme is jus whatever to me

It's a solid game but I don't like the RNG involved in the discoveries. It feels way too punishing for a euro game when you lose several troops and actions. I would prefer playing with the variant where all discoveries were known.

I think I would also prefer the knowing all buildings of an age (mainly the last one with the extra VPs) so you could plan things better but I'm ok either way on that one. The trade goods RNG is fine

This version has different starting powers than the age of empires one. I prefer the age of empire powers as this one has a lot of X-shot powers which seem a little swingy.

I am not a huge fan of area control games, but I like how this game implements it, while giving scope to do well without totally focusing on controlling map areas.

RATING: 8.5
- My gaming group really enjoys this. There aren't many worker placement games that play well with 5, and still pretty good with 6. Saying that, I prefer this with 4 as the higher player counts make it much harder to plan your round as the spots get taken so quickly.
- I like the different strategies in this game. Do you push for board presence, try to dominate the trade goods, go for the best buildings, go bulk exploration...
- The board/action spots feel really constrained. Often you want to do a hand-full of actions, but the order in which you go for these depends on what your opponents want to do. This makes for tight head-to-head moments, even in a game with many players.
- The game looks great on the table, though all the different player colours in the delux edition is a waste. I wish they had put some different buildings, or something else in instead like additional player powers.
- My one bug-bear with this game is the buildings. I feel that some of them are significantly better than others. This can make turn order and money very important. I wonder whether it would be better with an array of many/all buildings available for purchase from the get-go. This would enable every/most player to grab a good building.

RATING: 8
Similar format to Dominant species with a series of worker-placement spots along the side of the board. Everyone places workers in the first phase and activates them in the second (top to bottom, left to right). The rest of the board is a map for area control. Unlike Dominant Species, the full map is known from the start. The only random element is the discovery tile on each region. These are worth a one-time VP boost. The main difference is the lack of dominance mechanic. No dominance calculation means the game flows more smoothly. It does lack some of the tension of Dominant Species, and while I think DS is perhaps a deeper game, I prefer to play Age Of Discovery.

RATING: 9
The premium edition of one of the absolute best worker placement games out there. The deluxe edition adds elements that increase variety (player powers, world map, expansions included). Empires is a game that has plenty of variety already, though. Glad to own this edition.

Comes with:
- Builder Expansion
- Plague Expansion
- 4 KS Exclusive Tiles
- Player Boards with Unique Player Powers
- Extra summary cards

Details of my KS extras that I purchased:

+ World Variant Tiles ($17)
+ 100 extra metal coins (200 total) ($5)

In short, everything EXCEPT the set of gold miniatures. Chose to keep the Denmark and Ottoman boards rather than remove them to reduce my pledge.

I rated the original game 9.2 - it is one of my very favourite games.  Everything Drover added to the game since then has made the game worse, sometimes much worse.  The builder, the additional buildings , the nation powers, buying points etc.  Not only are these unnecessary, they turn an excellent game into a silly game.  Drover should know better than to include targeted actions, which were not in the base game.  I give this edition a score of 8 because the base game is in there, so you can still play it , but the horror of the additional stuff makes me mad.  The new board design is functionally better but looks worse - I am happy to play with either board.  I don't mind the rule tweaks to (a) see the Age 3 buildings at the start and (b) reduce the risks associated with discovery (note that this is what was needed to make discovery a viable option, not some silly building which gives more points for discoveries).  The rule tweaks obviously can be used with the original game.

There are some very fun ideas there, like almost everything involving the trade goods, but a majority of "meh".

[size=12][b]Why I like Empires: Age of Discovery:[/b][/size]
+ I like the new name because this board game is nothing like Age of Empires III.
+ The game is easy to teach. Empires: Age of Discovery was the first modern board game that I played and I have used this game as a gateway game for at least four people. 
+ The game has a theme that I like.
+ The game incorporates mechanics that I like.
+ The game does not drag on despite the long duration because the capital buildings keep things interesting.  
+ The game requires meaningful decisions to win despite the incorporation of a few random elements
+ The game has decent replayability with the two sides of the board, the capital building randomness, the random placement of trade goods, and the random set-up of the discovery tiles.

[size=12][b]Fixable dislikes in regards to Empires: Age of Discovery:[/b][/size]
/ Some of the variable player powers are better than others. I recommend removing the powers or making that sure everybody is happy with what they have. The powers are quite minor however. I have seen games where somebody won w/out using their power while everyone else did.
/ Some elements of the game are rarely used (like war or the $5 building spot) but variants can address these things if they bother you.
/ The rules fail to clarify some situations. I had to research these situations and rewrite the rulebook.
/ I am not a fan of the player boards. I put together some print and play player boards that addressed this issue.

A very good reimplementation of a worker placement classic.  The deluxe components and box are nice. I was less impressed with the builder's expansion materials and national advantages.  While they did add some interesting wrinkles to the gameplay, I felt that they also led to a less balanced feel than the original.  It's good that those components are included as an option though I haven't played the base game often enough to feel the need for that variety yet.

This is the updated version of AoE III with the expansion and new board and some minor rules changes.  I found it ok compared with the old edition.  The coins are cool, but I did not like the map art that much.  Pieces are the same.  I don't like the variable country powers that much.  

I found the game ok but in terms of what you have to pay for this edition, it seems like too much money.

An interesting game that tends to drag a bit towards the end. While the game rewards strategic thinking and an eye on the long game, the different mechanisms don't really blend well together.

I can see why this is a classic. There's so much to do, the tension is palpable, the bits are ridiculously overproduced and gorgeous, the art is great, and the overall experience is simply fantastic. I love the weight of the game. There's certainly a lot going on, and while it's by no means a "heavy" game, it's also far from light. It's a true medium weight game with many paths to victory. Like Endeavor, it has that "epic" feel to it. Speaking of Endeavor, a similarly themed game, I like both rather equally. Endeavor is lighter, I think and certainly quicker. AOE is better produced and possibly more cutthroat. It's also on par, in terms of rating, with Francis Drake. To be honest, I was on the fence whether this game was a 8.5 or a 9. The deciding factor was playing count. Against the advice of most users, I played this with only 2 the first time (my wife and I). It played awesome with 2! I'm sure it would be more tense and cutthroat with more, but with no variants whatsoever, the tension in a 2-player game can be easily cut with a knife. I love this game!

Update 2/8/15:

Played with 3 last night (Erin, Tyson and me). It was definitely better with 3 than with 2. It didn't seem like the board was that much "tighter" (credit to the 2-player experience), however, the warfare played a much greater role. After playing another game of this, I've seen some things I love and some things that I didn't particularly care for. 

Things I love:

-Art: beautiful colors and old world feel
-Components: love the minis, particularly the ships and the coins are quite nice
-Gameplay: The board makes the game feel epic! Also, even though you are sometimes placing 10 or more "workers" out on the board, your actions still seem scarce and important. This scarcity drives up the tension quite a bit. 
-Rounds: Being a Type A personality, I prefer having a set number of rounds in a game, and AOE does not disappoint. 
-Rules: They're not much to look at, but they are formatted approximately with a nice index. 

Things I didn't like: 

-The box. It's really bad. I have it sitting at the top of the stack to prevent dishing, but it's super thin cardboard and certainly not linen-finished. 
-The tiles: I'm not a fan of the art on the tiles. It's really blah. Also, I know it's a little difficult to put the entire action of each tile on a small counter, but looking the tiles up in the index constantly slows down gameplay in a game that is by no means short. 
-"Runaway leaderish": I wouldn't say that this game has a runaway leader problem, but it's close. I can say that it's unforgiving, particularly if you get left behind in exploration early on. Because of how the scoring works, it's a little difficult to make up lost ground. In a game of this length, you don't want it to be apparent that you have no way to win several rounds out. 

All in all, this game is truly great. For now, I'm going to keep it at a 9. Despite how much I like it, I cannot ignore the few problems I have with it. Nevertheless, this one will be in my collection for a long time.

RATING: 8.5
What a great game - I had the privilege of playing it for the first time this weekend.

The sign of a great worker placement or action selection game is when you really want and need to do EVERYTHING, and action choices are excruciating. This game has that in spades. I need to go first next turn to get first shot at the new buildings coming out, but if I do that I won't get that trade good that I need to make a set of four, and if I do either of those things I won't get enough guys to the docks to control a province, and either way, I won't get a merchant or builder to afford a building next turn...and on and on.

The game is extremely interactive, not just for fighting for the area control and the usual placement blocking, but in that you need to understand what each player is going for so that you can figure out what stuff you must claim now and what can wait for a later round.

I'm still on the fence about the builder expansion, which adds a lot of neat stuff, but also a lot of luck and take that play to the game. By adding new buildings, it becomes much less certain what will show up at the end, and you can take a strategy that just gets screwed. One guy in our game went hard for money and trade goods, and none of the three buildings that gave VPs for money, trade goods or merchant ships showed up in Age 3, whereas at least 2 and probably 3 would show up automatically without the expansion. Builders themselves also encourage soldiers and leader bashing to prevent bonuses, which I'm not sure is a good thing.

At any rate, I can't wait for more plays to determine whether it's an all time classic or merely an excellent game. 

Update: after a second play last night, my opinions are solidified - this is a really great game, and yet there are some real problems with the Builders expansion. On a second play, I realize it's not really the added viciousness that bothers me, it's the randomness and imbalances. The expansion buildings are just not balanced - some suck and some are game breaking.

Possibly my favorite game.  More plays will tell.
This is a worker placement game, with area control, and engine building mechanics. This version plays up to 6 and still has a quick play time. While this is a heavier game, it doesn't take too much to explain or get into. Any relatively experienced gamer can pick it up quickly. 

Edit 2/24: I really enjoy the new deluxe version. The builder adds a lot, making buildings more accessible, therefore increasing the engine building aspect. The player boards are very helpful, and the unique country powers are awesome! And the different game boards give more variety to the game. 

10/26 still a great game but dropped the rating as I am not a fan of take-that which this game has, and I am looking other worker placement games more.

Terribly dissapointed.  AOE is a really good game. This expansion (E:AoD is AOE with the builder expansion) turns a fine, fairly elegant strategy game into a chaotic, unbalanced, and somewhat screw-your-neighbor mess.  

The country's individual powers are not at all balanced and some of them negatively and arbitrarily affect other player's strategies, such as France's ability of bumping players out of acquiring trade goods. Because of the additional buildings, and the fact that some are much inferior to others, means that some players Will often be stuck with much inferior buildings as a result of luck of the draw - much more so than in original AOE. Some of the buildings allow a user to simply take victory points arbitrarily from an opponent or two, such as 'rewrite history', which allows a player to simply take a discovery tile from up to two different players.  Lame.  The builder token's ability to buy buildings for a five dollar discount is pretty cool, but the effect they have in the New World seems sort of tacked on, and because any player can use any other player's builders, a second place player in a given region can suddenly be handed a bunch of points that they had no part in obtaining just by being in the right region at the right time. 

It seems a number of people like the addition of all of this chaos to this game.  If this were an experiential sort of game I would understand, but as a strategy game, in my opinion this sort of additional chaos does not have a place here.  The original AOE is a far better strategy game in my opinion.

Ridiculous production values, so it looks really good. For me though, it's not probably worth the 100+ bucks, but I still enjoyed it, no doubt. There is some luck and randomness, but I'd say it's still more in the domain of euro than ameritrash. The different roles of the workers is a very good idea, but I'm not a huge fan of dudes on the map kind of area control, which plays a huge part here. It's also pretty in-your-face cutthroat, which is rarely interesting or morally gratifying.

Played deluxe KS edition with gold coins and Builder Expansion. It wasn't taught the best and wasnt fully clear but it was semi enjoyable. I wish workers did more differentiated things and dislike the chance of the tile resistance number flips and also dislike the ability to shoot, and I think the board could be better organized and the summary tiles too. It could tell turn order a little more cleanly imo. It also was semi high downtime and lasted a long time with 6p, from 2:40-5:18+ in terms of time and that was only up to round 4 of 8.

There was a lot of times I also thought to myself that some spots become bland to choose and just aren't helpful later down the line.

Anyway, I like the thematic workers, buildings are interesting, player country powers (I had Holland could be better or more interesting than one off) okay but could be more perpetual or asymmetric or interesting but rules could be a little clearer ish? 

Anyway overall too long and downtime ish but I like the theme (albeit wish it was more history than colonization era) and gameplay was okay...but I'm pretty sure I dislike most WP unless its like Caverna or LoW where all the options are constantly good ish.

I can't tell you how this compares to the original;  it's been too long since I played it.  What I can tell you is that this is a pretty solid worker placement/area control game disguised as a civ/conquest game, and that six players does not feel like too many.  However, I really disliked the high range of variability on the discovery tiles, and the game gets a lot less fun on the final turn because half of the actions become obsolete (though I guess that's partly due to the New World variant elements).  I'd play again but I won't be requesting it.

Nasty, nasty, nasty worker placement and area control game. It makes me really happy to play it, since all players get to be jerks, so no one feels left out. It'd be a bit more interesting to play it if it had a shorter play time. In any case, it stays among my favourite worker placement games, if only for introducing nice interaction mechanisms between players.

Oh, yeah, and the production value is out of this world.

Kickstarted this deluxe edition and wish I hadn't. Way too expensive, especially since I already own Age of Empires III.

It feels like any changes made in this new edition were entirely due to licenses having expired. The new artwork is at best a lateral move, improving in some areas, worsening in others. For example, the new board, while being more functional than the original, is plain and less thematic.

New components gained from stretch goals are not much use. Player boards, player aids, and score board/scoring pad are unnecessary and just take up table space. New colors of figures don't make the game playable with more players, just provide palette swaps. The colonist track overlays don't even match the color of the colonist track on the board. The best component is the new metal coins which have a satisfying weight and, unlike the original, are stackable.

The national identity powers are unbalanced and some abilities can really create bad feelings amongst the players. The new box is great, but the new insert is too deep, making digging out the game pieces difficult. The new rulebook improves on some levels, but stretch goal additions weren't added, so new Capital Buildings may be confusing.

Frankly, I'm keeping my Age of Empires III, and the coins from this deluxe edition. E:AoD is still a good game, but no improvement over the original.

Empires has more in common with Lords of Waterdeep or Francis Drake than StarCraft or Eclipse. So with my reticence and squeamishness noted, I really enjoyed playing this game. Maybe that speaks more of the company I played with, but with every turn, I was able to appreciate every element of Empires. And it thrilled me. And to me, it represented the very best of the genre, making it a strong contender for the Perfect Game. I can easily start with small compliments to the quality of the components and the artwork of the board, but I can aim higher at the elegance of the game's design. Empire's is made to suit multiple player's strategies, both veteran and new. The mechanics and game play are so simple and clear, giving players enough time to switch up their strategies and make meaningful decisions between placement and turns. While winning strategies may not seem new (gaining more actions as fast as possible or hoarding money and resources for victory point multipliers at the end), the game's ability to make all the information and accounting so concise and clear for all players really won me over. And perhaps this is the game's greatest achievement: not getting distracted with reinventing the wheel of worker placement games. In my humble opinion, many designers may feel bored by the mechanics of the genre, seeing it as stale and a bit dated; they might add secret deployment, intricate combat mechanics, adding nonessential RPG story elements, etc. But Empires focuses on clarity and ease; from across the table, one opponent could see what pieces I had left and could see my decisions based off his placement. That ability of transparency isn't found in many games and definitely deserves to be acknowledged more than once in this semi-review. Empires was a wonderful experience and gets my full-hearted support for The Perfect Game for anyone, experienced or non-experienced gamers alike! True, our game lasted around four hours but we didn't notice! For those looking for a game of solid prestige and replayability after their games of Catan or Codenames, please try Empires: Age of Discovery, you won't be disappointed!

Phenomenal mix of action selection and area control that really captures the historical theme. A unique 4x game with a fairly quick playtime. Creating an effectively thematic 4x game with meaty decisions that plays in under three hours is no simple task. Play with the capital buildings of all three ages laid out for all to see in advance. I think the discovery tiles and cards should have been worth a few more points to broaden the strategic options.

Worker Placement and area control fused. Players lay their pawns into action spaces on the big table to the right, and then when everyone is done the board is resolved from top to bottom, left to right. 

One element of the game that initially really excited me was that there are actions that, for the cost of a worker this round give you a worker for the next round that has some special ability or function for one or two specific action spaces. I tend to like games where not all workers are treated equally. 

The game starts out where everything seems possible, and then you realize as the colonist dock fills up, and as people grab the trade goods, and as the player ahead of you in turn order drops his captain in the merchant ship box, that you'll have to do better to get what you want.

The game includes rules for the players to have variable player powers that are really strong, and really detract from the generally enjoyable core experience of the game. Many of the powers have strong unmitigatable take-that effects. Thankfully playing with them is optional.

It doesn't help that this game has one or two really frustrating building tiles that can be built that tend to warp games in similar ways every time they come out. In particular, the building that lets you force trade good swaps, effectively giving you lots of money and one or more players no money; and yet it's rare the player who spends the resources to take this wins.

Component wise, the building tiles can be a little difficult as they have text but often require looking up their full use in the rulebook. The meeples are plastic and dinky. Prone to falling over, and hard to tell apart from each other. 

Overall, the game isn't bad, but the luck is a little high, the components aren't wonderful, and it's similar enough to Dominant Species that I'd rather be playing that game. It has none of these little issues, but a similar feel, and is generally more enjoyable, if harsher.

Good game, one of the best worker placement games out there, but I have a slight preference for Lords of Waterdeep in this category.

A massive and complex worker placement game.  
Can be quite the brain burner as you try to plan out what you need to do over your next few turns.   Unfortunately even the most calculated of plans can be forfeit to chance as the late game is extremely swingy.   The end game tiles that grant players fountains of points and act as strategic capstones are randomly drawn at the very end of the game... at a point where your engine is already set, and it is extremely difficult to pivot.   
You just have to pick a play style and hope the game ends up rewarding what you've been doing all game anyway.

This is a beautifully redone version of the original Age of Empires. I don't really think it's necessary for owners of the original to get this one, although I do love the included builder expansion that really just opens up a variety of different options to the game. It certainly is mean and cutthroat and it seems every action is contested and every player gets angry at least at one point. Just an excellent competitive challenge.

RATING: 10
Rating based on the previous version of the game. The Deluxe Edition adds some more content and quite an upgrade components wise, so I expect the rating to possibly go further up.

UPDATE: Incredibly deep and tense strategy game. The mix of worker placement and area control make for challenging decisions and multiple approaches to victory. The quality of the components in the Deluxe Edition is simply through the roof. Truly a masterpiece.

RATING: 5
Worker placement area control game vaguely reminiscent of (but inferior to) Dominant Species. Different types of workers are placed on a bevy of spaces, which are resolved in order; some grant different worker types, others trade goods (grant income), the ability to purchase buildings, deployment of units to areas on the board, or combat between units already deployed.

Age of Discovery has been a local favourite since it was Age of Empires III and frankly I do not understand. It's generally functional and it's clear that different approaches can work (which is to say, there are a number of source of points and any blend will do), and while the direct conflict might turn some off I have no issue with it. My main concern is the degree of randomness, e.g. that buildings seem unbalanced in general, but [i]wildly[/i] unbalanced in context of different player strategies; random difficulty of discovery tiles can also be problematic. If ever a eurogame ends with a five point difference and someone can directly point to the six points they just missed out/just got by a freak card draw then I have little inclination to play again.

The use of low-quality plastic miniatures for workers causes some ergonomic issues; it would be better with cubes for basic workers and miniatures for specialists only. 

Like most euro-ameritrash hybrids it's a sour spot with the appeal of neither. Soulless, themeless points acquisition combined with random factors and occasional direct conflict. Just play Caylus and then Cthulhu Wars; playing both at the same time is no improvement.

The two-player version works quite well!  I would say ignore those who rate the two player game as "not recommended".  Relative to three or four players, it may not be as good (though I would say "different" rather than "better"), but it is still outstanding.  For those that complain about it not being as "tight" and tense as 3+ player games, or that it's too easy to get money via trade goods with two players (both valid complaints), it's very simple to fix that: restrict Trade Goods to have only three spaces available, instead of the normal four spaces.  My wife and I play with this House Rule and it works great, and creates plenty of tension.  You can do this restriction with the other actions if you want as well (e.g., only 3 spaces for Buildings or Warfare).

One annoyance, and the reason for the less-than-10 rating, is that at least for the two-player game, some buildings are clearly unbalancing (e.g., way too much gold or VP produced relative to other tiles) and excessively influence the outcome of the game (also true for some of the expansion buildings, which weren't as well play-tested).  These imbalances are fixable via House Rules though -- you can tweak the power of some of the buildings however you want so that they are more in-line with the other buildings.

Okay game, but way overproduced and overpriced. The player board are too large so it takes up a lot of table space. The building tiles just have text and some very simple clip art. There are a few errors on some of the tiles and the rulebook is unclear in a number of areas.

Once you get past those issues, though, it's not a bad worker placement game. It uses a worker placement "menu" just like Dominant Species and there is a bit of an area control element where you can score points and get good by moving to different areas.

So I guess it's time to update my original comment on Age of Empires III as this is technically a new edition.  There's a lot of reasons, why I might not like this game... it has dudes on a map, it's long and there's direct player conflict.  And there's a fair bit of random swing in which capital buildings come out, or what a discovery fight value might be.   But despite those reasons I really enjoy this game.  

There is conflict but it's governed by a really great worker placement system that controls how many units you can get to the field, which upgraded units you'll have available and how you can wage conflict.  And there's a lot more going on than just area control (although I'm not sure that you can ignore the area control aspects and still do well).  

Overall, this is a game that is great fun and I wish I could play it more often.

I love the first edition, and this one is an upgrade, particularly if you spring for the metal coins.  The game itself is relatively unchanged.  This is the best worker placement game I've played.  The workers feel like a natural model of being a 16th century monarch, and the different strategies you can pursue are well-balanced.  There's a delicious balance of limitation and openness with what you can do every turn.

This edition allows you to play with or without the builder expansion, which is nice to have for variety.  In general, I lean toward playing without the expansion.  The builders emphasize building and colonization even more than the base game, which already emphasized those two things a lot.  The extra buildings are good, but they add a lot more randomness that can swing things heavily late in the game.  I suggest fixing this by playing with the later buildings open knowledge from the beginning of the game.

Heavier then I expected. Mix of Euro and Ameritrash which is cool.  First game was a bit overwhelming.  The war seemed a bit odd, almost like it didn't belong. GREAT bits and box.

This is one of those games that I love despite its flaws. There is a great mix of area-control and worker placement with variable powered workers with plenty of interesting player interaction that goes beyond what a plain area-control game would provide. But as I said its not without flaws. It can be a bit luck based and swingy especially based on what buildings come out in the third age.

Eagle Game's ridiculously overproduced luxury version of one of it's classic games, Age of Empires III. Everything here has been revamped, reworked for balance and rewritten for clarity. The original game remains almost intact, with most of the redesign work being done on the expansion material. 

While I am usually happy to take a pass on luxury editions, I'm glad I didn't miss this one. Big chunky tiles, an excellent rulebook and clarifications on everything that was ambiguous in the first edition releases. The only part that's a step backwards is the board, as it is rather drab compared to the original. I think they went for function over form though, as the new one is much easier to take in at a glance, due to the much larger spaces and muted color tones.

It's expensive, but worth every penny.

Good Game. There are many things going on. There are also many ways to win.

The first game there is learning curve to work out. Once you learn the mechanics it can go quite quickly (as long as other players know the rules - it is my experience that noobs struggle).
Two criticisms that should not dtere anyone from playing or buying the game. Rather there should be an improvement. 

First the game has a military element, but it is sorely neglected. Going down the path of military development is not a way to win. When one considers the importance of the armies in America (or more importantly navies where there is nothing in play) it seems like there should be more benefit towards war. There is a capital improvement where you can invade a province adjacent to you, but you must be able to buy that improvement and also be able to develop military capabilities with an improvement as well, (which is a gamble because the improvement may never turn up or you may be beaten out to the improvement by an opponent). You can use the military to get first or second place in a region and for points in the discovery of a region, but it is an investment of resources for limited return in a game where money is tight and is much more important to success. 

The second issue is the lack of money at the start of the game. You need to focus on developing an economy or you are going to lose. Money is essential to getting capital improvement which are necessary to victory. This is why going down the road of a military victory is hard. Holding on to provinces should bring in more income at the end of a turn or an era. This might make developing a military avenue to victory more important.

Really enjoyable and I would play again.  BUT -- it does come at a very high price point and I've read/heard the secondary map doesn't come with all the components.

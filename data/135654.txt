New Dawn is easily a Terra Mystica killer. While TM is a game forcing you to know literally everything before you play (or you're going to have a bad time) and forces you to calculate immensely and make 80% of the importance of your game's decisions before it even starts, ND does none of this.

The cool inspirations are still there: you gain resources by moving objects off your player board, there are variable player boards/powers, and you control areas, even converting them into stuff you can best use, to gain one of three resources that you use to efficiently farm VP.

The dice in this game are bizarrely inoffensive. In fact, every single element of random chance in this game seems to have been placed in with tact, care, and taste. Usually, I'm the first person to rip a game to shreds for lazy randomness, so it is with surprise that I can say New Dawn is fine. The dice are like a CRT, where you eliminate doing poorly as you upgrade in color (Green -> White -> Yellow -> Red). There are so many mitigating factors for dice that they're almost not a risk management mechanic and just a resource managing mechanic instead.

The cards being (sort of) random just blinds you for one turn so you'll never know what move is most optimal next, preventing the AWFUL situation in engine-builders where you have to calculate a ton. Instead, your overall Strategy is preserved (because you can choose what types of facilities you draw), but your Tactics will adapt on-the-fly due to the variance in exactly which cards you draw of a particular type. This is even further mitigated by Ambassador cards, which are usually a way to efficiently help you get good facilities.

Something that may confuse players are the green arrows on facility cards. While the rulebook does explain that they point to the OFF-BOARD bonus cards, it's hard to shelve your first thought, which is "These must point to other Facilities or something". The arrows are a bit of a misnomer from a conveyance standpoint. You can also end up in situations where some directions are just unilaterally better due to the specific board configuration, but it's rare.

The flow of the game is interesting and a bit odd at first. Exploring was definitely the weirdest phase. You place a facility from hand and gain its ability but you don't gain control over it. Instead, you wait until you have a MHQ there (or adjacent if attacking) and either attack or buy it for cost. Attacking uses different (and usually less) resources than buying, especially during early game. Once you realize that facility cards are used for two completely different purposes, you get the hang of it. It's technically streamlined and smart, but would've helped if a rule explained that they have a dual-purpose, instead of just walking you through the game and hoping you catch on.

The rulebook is a bit ambiguous at times, as well as some of the facility effect wordings. We had no problem just ruling them and moving on, but it's something to take note of if you have particularly competitive tables.

One major aspect of the game that we found was better left ignored was PVP combat. Since players make CONTESTED rolls, it's usually just a waste of an action. Even if you can somehow magically attack a player efficiently, using a minimum of resources to get over their defense, they might now also take it back in the same way, wasting both of you an action and accomplishing nothing. It's better to just have a good plan. Sadly, this nerfs several things in the game, especially two of the races. I get the impression that New Dawn was really proud of its PVP, but it really shouldn't be.

The card and player board quality is really bad. This game practically demands 70mm square sleeves for the cards, and lamination of the player boards. However, if you do this, you'll find that all the rest of the components are top-notch. The plastic pieces are great, the chits are high quality board, and the game board is gigantic, beautiful, sturdy, and feels nice to the touch.

I've yet to try the back side of the game board with the zone variant but it looks like it adds some advanced planning to the game. I would really recommend people start with it due to the fact that facility placement barely matters in the base game.

Due to the extreme number of races included, the few cards you actually see during one game, and the zones variant of the board, New Dawn appears to have a ton of replay value even if you instantly perfect it from a strategic standpoint—which you won't. I can see myself playing many times in the future, just to refine my VP-gathering efficiency.

Overall, excellent engine-builder/4X game, even if the PVP weak. Definitely recommended for fans of Sci-Fi/Space, Among the Stars universe characters, dice-chuckers (you get the feel, none of the luck), people who hate randomness, and 4X fans.

A surprise hit. I saw the board and components, and thought this was just going to be a generic, combat-heavy reimplementation of Among the Stars (a game I like, but don't love). 

Man, was I wrong. This is a very clever Euro-Ameritrash hybrid with lots of interesting moving parts and enough unique/modular components to promise many repeated plays. The combos you can set up with the cards, the techs, and the bonus actions make for some very satisfying turns. Just when it seems like one player is dominating, one big turn can shift the balance in the opposite direction, and scores can be very close in the end. 

"Combat" is relatively mild, and only involves taking over a card an opponent occupies, so it's not nearly as devastating to lose a battle as in other combat-heavy games. There is a bit of a problem with luck of the draw, and sometimes a player can pull off an insane combo with her cards while another player can't do anything. I suppose this is inevitable in a card-heavy game, so I don't mind it, but it will be a turn-off for some people.

Very excited about his game. There was a bit of a stumble in the beginning of the kickstarter but i got to say with the reviews from Vasel and Undead Viking, I am geek'd. Not that I need someone to tell me what is good because I backed it waaay before I saw their reviews.  Just added confidence.  
Can't wait to wage war and forge a new empire in the galaxy. I do love 4x games.

Build your empire in space on the basis of economic, scientific, military and hostile facilities. As you build a base on a facility (or take it by force) it gives you a certain benefit. This benefit is economic of nature for economic facilities, military for military facilities...This is a nice feature, as it increases the thematic depth. This is lacking in Among the Stars for instance. The replayability of the game is boosted by the fact that only a maximum of 4 of the 8 available races can participate in a game, that there are a lot of different facilities of which only a limited subset can be built during a game, that only 4 out of 8 facility benefits are involved in a game, that you can only use 5 out of the 8 available race specific technologies... All in all a very nice game which is both about resource production and management, as well as about waging war. A good mix of different actions, different ways of scoring points (peacefully build bases, or wait for the others to do as such and then prey on them, or send aid to the Alliance)...Do I need to go on? Didn't think so.

Strange variant on the 4X model where you use a flying base (Mobile HQ) to establish control of different space stations and facilities. Some bizarre mechanics - for example, four bonus cards sit on the game board edges, and facilities gain those bonuses depending on which direction they face. 

The amount of different things that happen on every turn seems to fly directly in the face of the simplicity of "Among the Stars." 

Like most 4X games you end up fighting the other players for control of the different areas, and this involves a lot of dice rolling (and the rules are pretty difficult to understand regarding which dice to roll - needs a player aid). 

Beautiful art and components. I would play again based on this alone, but I don't think it's all that impressive of a game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
I may rate this higher if I give it another few goes.  The best part of this game is that it's really difficult to fall very far behind unless lady luck just isn't on your side.  Having the minis expansion is serious overkill, but in terms of the mechanics, I find it much more engaging than its sister, Among the Stars.

That being said, I still find that the automatic turn order needs to be addressed as the ambassadors are quite powerful and I feel that when you have something on the board like that (in short, they allow you to do some extremely useful buffing actions or out-of-sequence stuff), you ought to have a turn-order bidding mechanic.

Still, this is a pretty good game, but ultimately depends on some luck-based cards, like the orientation bonuses.  When that VP bonus comes out, the whole game changes and that rubbed me a little wrong.

Az Among the stars-szal nem sikerült még játszani, de az is és ez is nagyon érdekelt, főleg azért, mert nagyon szépek, nomeg akkora a hype körülöttük.
Utólag kiderült, hogy nem néztem eléggé utána a dolgoknak, mert ha tudtam volna, hogy ez gyakorlatilag egy felturbózott Rizikó, akkor annyira nem izgatott volna. Szép a kivitelezés, bár néhol a egyáltalán nem felhasználóbarát a design, jópofa, tematikus ötlet a létesítmények forgatása a világűrben, a játékidő is tolerálható. Viszont továbbra sem szeretem kifejezetten direktbe konfrontatív játékokat pláne, ha a harc kockákkal dől el. Ez ebben a játékban különösen fájdalmas, mivel az egész játék alatt összesen 15 szabadon választott akciód van. Így ha egy-egy szerencsétlen dobás miatt elbuksz egyet, akkor igen nagy hátrányba kerülsz. Persze lehet mindenfélével befolyásolni a dobást, és növelni az esélyek, de ha túlbiztosítasz, akkor meg arra megy el rengeteg energiád és azért kerülsz hátrányba.
Fura volt még, hogy szinte csak kényszerből érdemes szimpla akciót csinálni, amúgy mindig van egy-egy nagykövet, ami jobban megéri.
Nem az én világom, de még ezt belekalkulálva se tudott igazán lenyűgözni. Nem teljesen rétem a hype-ot.

Played once during SPIEL14 in Essen.

It took two of the five rounds to get a hang of the game. 

Special user/race powers, each with unique technology cards that can be aquired during the game. The area control aspect of the board is nice. I've heard people being concerned about the dice combat -- I actually *liked* it. The four different dice are pretty thematic and easy to understand after a few combats: Yellow dice if you have a base or HQ on the location you want to conquer or defend, a slightly less powerful white die (normal d6) for support from HQs on adjacent locations, even less powerful green dice for support through special powers, bonus tiles etc; powerful red dice for bonus through technologies or from other sources.

After the 1/3 most of the players had a main strategy and the board became crowded in a good way and tactical play started.

One thing I did not like so much: after conquering a location, you can rotate it to enable different "benefit cards" that are location on each edge of the board. Makes no thematic sense, in my opinion, and we forgot to do it a few times. It's just another mechanism in a game that actually has enough mechanism already.

Speaking of mechanisms: area control (obvious); dice fights; some worker placement (when vying for the ambassadors) -- turn order is crucial for that, as usual; ressource management (buy, or conquer; which bonuses to get, which technologies).

No rating after one play; but in general I liked it. The most location never come into play, so each game should feel different. Not sure about balancing.

First game took almost 3h with 4 players. I guess ~2h is realistic for subsequent plays.

I have been two times very close of being playing this, but it hasn't emerged on the table nevertheless. Some sort of sequel to the Among the Stars, presumably bigger in scale, adds spaceships and space exploration instead of just building your own station. There's an actual combat elements now too. It also adds a game board. It still remains to be seen if this can replace my sci-fi favorite from the top spot. There's a chance that this is a bit too complex in order to be better than smoothly running Among the Stars.

Not a bad game, but not for me.  Aggression is definitely rewarded as defending your bases is not really possible.  I find it kind of annoying to have the empire I've built up so easily destroyed.  Mechanics are interesting though.

Acceptable area control game with a loose science fiction theme.  Parts of the setting are done well, but the Mobile Headquarters would have been so much better as battle fleets and and the art-free, flavorless Technology cards were a huge missed opportunity.  Game play is the usual rush to score points and is both straightforward and fast.

This is a somewhat more strategic extension of Among the Stars, where the players are playing together on a single board instead of doing their own thing. It's an odd kind of game, really, because even though we played it one and a half times (the first play we screwed up rules majorly and started over) I still don't have much of an idea what the game was simulating. What are the cards you're playing? What are the bases you're moving around? What kind of story is supposedly emerging from all this? Thematically, I really can't tell you what any of the game is doing. This confusion stems to some of the mechanisms of the game. When you play a card ("explore a facility") you get the benefit of the card immediately, which you won't get again. Moving a "mobile HQ" onto it doesn't do anything, but establishing a base there gives you some lesser bonus. So sometimes cards do big things, sometimes small things, sometimes nothing at all, and it's not clear why that should be. As for playing the game, it has some interesting ideas in it, but boy, if you fall behind, you are screwed. The last turn of the game I had three actions to use, none of which had any chance of improving my position. It's possible I'm just not very good at it.

Initially I've liked this game a lot, especially the atmosphere. But the more I'm playing, the more I dislike it. Why?

Cons:
• Kingmaking problem - especially in a 4p game there are moments at the end of the game where one player has to decide which player wins. But these moments are all over the game - if one players gets ahead, then he can easily choose which player to destroy entirely. 
• Too much randomness in combat and the outcome is too bad for the loser and too good for the winner.
• Only one way how to win - by controlling area. You can't win by focusing on anything else.

Pros:
Well, the art is definitely very nice. And there are also some nice innovative ideas, but still...

Not worth getting. Too volatile.

First play in 2. The engine building does have a nice feel, but the options what to do with the resources are quite limited. Time will tell how best to combine it, or whether it's heavily draw-dependent, I'd definitely raise the hand limit from four to five (it's the same number as the player's technology limit or bases-of-one-type anyway).
The game makes it pretty hard for a player who fell behind to raise from the bottom. Definitely prefer AtS over this, but I don't regret the purchase and we shall see how will it turn out after a few plays.

Not my normal kind of game, but pretty fun and fast (if no one has AP).  The card sorting is kind of a pain. Also, my partner has gleefully taken to destroying me with dice rolling.

Only 1 incomplete play, so will rate after a full game.

Edit 16/05/2015: Played a full game. The problem with this game is that if you fail to conquer a facility, you're punished twice as you wasted an action and on top of that you will have 1 resource less as you couldn't put away a base.

Neat little game and pretty simple. Over whelming and causes AP in the early rounds, even though many of the decisions are not that critical. also… dice driven, which isn't very satisfying.

Disclaimer: I know the designer and like him as a person.
The above being said I have been disappointed with one of his previous game, and am typically not keen on area control games.

I think this is a very solid game in the genre that gives a few ways to grow a strategy, although the tactical nature, and random elements definitely makes this more of an opportunistic optimisation than game long crafting of an intertwined web of building blocks to victory. Would happily play again!

Expansions: KS Stretch Goals, Exodai

I quite like New Dawn but it's just a little too complex for what it is, and area control is often not a great mechanism for me - It's likely going to be on my sell pile for UKGE 2018.

That said, I would certainly like to try and give it another try before then and see if it can convince me that it should stay ;P.

This game is from the same publisher and designer as Among the Stars.  The art style and setting are the same as well but this is a pretty different game.  Instead of a drafting, tableau building game this one is about players exploring and taking control of a section in space in order to become the most efficient alien race and score the most points.

Each round consists of several phases where players will draw facility cards, "explore" those cards (put them on the board) move their MHQs (I assume this stands for mobile headquarters) around the board, and either settle or attack these locations as well as research new technology, hire ambassadors, send aid to the alliance...and I'm sure there is more.  There are a lot of options and moving parts to this game but the lion's share of it is control of the different facilities on the game board.  When the game starts out, especially in a first game, players spend most of their resources just paying the cash to build a base on these facilities.  Before long though most of the facilities will have been bought up and the game does kind of hit a point where aggression is forced on almost everybody.

Games like this have an inherent weakness built into them I think.  Where at some point some players are almost forced to engage in PvP.  Often it's the player that is left unharassed or least harassed who ends up skating to victory under the radar.  This is certainly possible in this game as well so that is something to look out for.

All-in-all I enjoyed this game though.  Each player plays an alien race with a unique power and set of technology cards.  Each of the facilities does something a little different (although they are all just variations of the same game effects).  There are several different ambassador powers to use and even a few different base bonuses and aid to the alliance cards to take advantage of.  This offers a lot of variety, which I adore in games, and can open up a lot of ways to play the game.

However, this amount of content can be a hindrance to players prone to AP as well.  There is a lot to take in and consider and it is all changing constantly.  Some people can take an awful long time on their turns, especially if the previous player "messed up what they were going to do" because there is so much to take in.  Exacerbating that is the board can get very busy by mid-game on when the board is littered with ambassadors and bases and MHQs in 4 different colors.

Once you get the hang of it though and can filter out all the noise on the board this is a deep and engaging game that offers a lot of replay value.

I truly want to love this game, but something is missing. Too many things happening in one round to tactically wing it, but not enough rounds to really cap of my plans.

I should play it again, it should really really be my type of game.

Not impressed. 

The game is pretty, but the graphic design doesn't support the gameplay. For example, the ambassador card's text is so small it is impossible to read without picking the card up, the player boards have a "1" printed underneath so I have to count my resources each time.

The technologies were pretty meaningless, by the end of the game, all players had comfortably purchased all techs. There isn't really any real "oomph" in the techs either, they were all pretty generic across all races.

If you find yourself going behind in the first turn or two, there isn't much you can do to get yourself out of the hole. One player had his base building blocked on turn one and it then was attacked on turn two meaning he had only one base at the end of the first round. Everyone else had two or three which meant that player was out of the game. 

Another negative, two players had much better cards right  out of the start and were able to gain a quantity of resources right at the start of the game.  One player had clearly bum cards that offered nothing special and was clearly getting annoyed at having crap installations to explore. This could be houseruled, however.

Finally, halfway through the second round, we all felt it was obvious who would win. We were right.

Simple rules, great gameplay! This is an excellent game of space exploration/conquest. It has very fresh mechanics that work very well. It is a very tense game until the end. The good news is that it is a unique game and provides a new and fresh game design in space exploration/conquest. Go and get your copy now. It is completely different than Among the stars (except the art) and a better game at the same time. Interaction among the players is high.

Best 2hr 4X-ish game? Perhaps, though it's not without drawbacks.

+ Absolutely gorgeous art and minis.

+ Great variety

+ Fun combat

- Make no mistake, this is an area control game. It's a good area control game, but the thing that sets 4x games apart is specialization - that there are multiple paths to victory and all of them are more or less viable, whether they're through tech, or culture, or conquest. Here conquest is the only really viable option.  Nothing else is worth nearly as many victory points as territories are.

Really like all of the individual mechanisms of this game, but my initial play I just wasn't into it.  Was positive the game was going to be a hit for me, kind of a disappointment.  It all just fell a little flat, decisions didn't feel very important, races and stations weren't all that different. There was little sense of ownership of clever combos.  Just setups for fun dice rolling, but that's not enough.

I was sort of underwhelmed by this one.  

There were some fun parts of the game, as it was very interactive (e.g., very much a whack on your neighbor type game), and very colorful.

But, it feels very random, and way longer than I had hoped.  Also, like many Artipia games, the graphic design is much, much too much.  Lots of pretty pictures, but things that are important (like text) is incredibly hard to find and read over the colorful board.  Also, some odd design choices - why on earth are the benefit cards that pay a heavy role in the game relegated to just being thrown off the edges of the board?  Would some tokens that actually fit on the board have been better choices.

I'd play it again, but it isn't one I'm likely to keep.

This is actually a decent game. The main problem is that it takes up a ridiculous amount of table space. Also, while it doesn't force players to attack each other, it's clear that it is balanced around players doing so. Without attacking (and players in my groups don't attack each other), most of the dice rolling is meaningless, making most of the dice tokens/special powers meaningless. Players essentially sit around twiddling their thumbs and gathering resources to buy points during the few opportunities that exist for those actions. If this had special "peaceful variant" rules to make it more exciting without attacking, it might be worth keeping. As it is, I have better games for vanilla resource management.

As Alliance officials we are to rebuild and revive a broken sector of the Galaxy. Compass oriented tile placement of our space station systems provides specific benefits. Dice combat system is decent. Alien Ambassadors with unique powers can be invited to assist. Very tactical area control game. Combo rich turns. I love the MHQ ability to hop around the galaxy. Combat heavy but losses are not catastrophic.

Update: Final version dropped the player wheel card to track points, money, and science, and military(?). Not sure about the wheel thing. Good choice to go with a proven system.

Good fun kids game.  So easy to play that the kids can play it without actually thinking and that is what the two three year olds I played with were doing.  They grasped taking turns and placing tiles, but didn't grasp the actual aim.

2016-06-23 (rating 6):

A poor game. Randomness in drawn tiles is awful. I don't feel like the results depend much on what you do. Luck factor seems far more important.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Kids' Carcassonne removes the most difficult but also the most fun concepts of the original Carcassonne. You no longer need to match the tiles since they all fit together. Moreover there is no fighting over majorities. 

This is clearly a game for learning some basic boardgaming tactics, i.e., who is winning, who benefits the most from a move and how not to give too many free points for opponents. For adults with some gaming experience this is all too easy and the whole game reduces to the question, who draws the most tiles in his/her own colour.

I would not suggest this for grownups but I could agree on playing it with kids.

RATING: 7
Rating based on the reaction of my 4 year old. He had no trouble grasping the basic concepts of the game. It is complex enough to keep me interested yet simple enough for my kid to actually compete. The pieces are chunky and very sturdy.

This game is dead boring for adults, but a huge hit with kids, who like to handle the bits (and play the game).

Contrary to many, I do find that this junior edition is pertinent. The game works with kids that would be unable to play regular carcassonne. The thing is, this is no carcassonne, just a kid's nice tile laying game.

This is a great game for kids.  It plays quickly, teaches turn taking, some strategy and thinking ahead as well as how to win / lose.  There is some luck in it, but largely the game is won or lost by strategic moves.

All games are VERY close, so kids won't feel they are losing for the entire game.

This game is great because kids can play it not knowing the strategy for the game, but as they get older you can see more gears turning and they slowly add strategy to their tile placement. Very smartly designed game.

My eldest daughter is 3 and a half, so I really had to buy this game as a gift for her (her first "real" boardgame was The Magic Labyrinth and she loves to play with dad and mom!).
The gameplay is simplified in a very clever way from the real Carcassonne: tiles always match! But there is some kind of decision in where to place the drawn tile, so that adults can "enjoy" the 10-15 minutes duration of the game...
This is perhaps the greatest possible link between adult and child boardgames, and I really recommend it for introducing kids to boardgames!
I rate it a 6 in an adult scale, but it should really be a 9 or 10 from a kids point of view!

Really impressed with this one and had a blast playing with my 2.5 and 5 yr olds.  They understood it all pretty quick.  Even though every tile is designed to always fit, I like that a little bit of forethought (dare I say strategy) can help you get all your meeples on first for the win.

Update 5 months later:  This is now on my list of must have games for families with young kids.  My five year old is catching onto the (small) strategy aspect, and my near three year old plays right along with the rest of us (he does still need reminding of when to put pieces on).  Our one year old has watched us play enough (she usually is the city destroying monster), that she knows the meeples are supposed to go on the tiles.

Madeline really loves it and it seems to have replayability with her. The strategy isn't very deep and I would like it if every piece couldn't be laid down on every tile. And strategy seems to make about a one meeple difference - if I give M that kind of lead she wins about half the time! played it 5 times with her immediately! We'll see if it has staying power...

Rating for KIDS.  This is an excellent introduction to Carcassonne.  Kids ages 3-6 are the primary target.  The components are top notch, with large meeples complementing some very sturdy tiles.  The children can start by just playing tiles and learn to make tactical decisions that will affect the outcome.  There is luck involved in when the children of Carcassone get pulled out, and that's perfect for this target audience.  Excellent game.

So far played with my almost-4yo. She enjoyed the pictures and the building of the roads. She occassionally remembered/understood the scoring but didn't even come close to understanding the strategy. She still has a very flexible relationship with rules.

With all that said, Kids of Carc is actually a pretty fun game that can be played pretty non-competitively. Strategy is limited (very), but the idea that there are slight ways to improve your chances of winning will, I imagine, be a very big ah-ha for my daughter. In the meantime, she loves to put her dudes on the roads and build the cities and take care of the sheep.

Solid little euro for young kids.  Excellent components and bright artwork really caught the attention of my 5 y.o. and she's requesting this frequently. KoC ranks right up there among my favorites for very young kids, especially since it provides a good introduction to tile laying and planning ahead (not much, but a little).  For adults, there's not much strategy here, but just watching my daughter's excitement while playing this game helps me envision even greater gaming happiness in the future!

Having a son (2010) that loves to play too is a blessing.

Children's version of Carcassonne, featuring oversized tiles that line up with every other tile edge.  The only connecting terrain is roads, and when a road is completed, every illustration of a child on the tiles allows a "cheeple" of that colour to be played onto the map.  First player to get all their cheeples onto the board wins.  Cute, and ideal for small children who want to play with mum and dad.

This is a really nice children game you could play easily with the whole family. My kids played this at the age of 5 and still enjoy the game now with 6 and 9 years!

The components have a really good quality, bigger children meeples and thick card board tiles, larger than the original small Carcassonne tiles. (You could find a picture of comparison in the files/images, here on BGG.)

Without taking care the easy "rules" you could play this with children at age 4 as well, but now older my kids playing this alone without Mom and Dad!

What's great about the game is there are no 'wrong' answers (every tile can always be played, so no frustration), the pieces are well-suited for young hands, the pictures and other components make telling a story out of the game easy (which is how we play), the game teachings pattern recognition and advance planning, and it's fairly easy for the parents to secretly control the outcome of the game (arranging it to end in a tie, or for certain people to win), useful for those still learning to control their emotions!  I'm hoping this will be a nice stepping stone to the full game in a few years...

A great first game with fantastic bits. The rules can be understood by a three-year-old and the game has very little strategy, so they can play it too. It does offer one tactical notion for kids to learn, though, since tiles can usually be placed in positions more or less helpful to an opponent, and especially in such a way as to create fragile alliances with another color, or indeed to put your color into an opponent's long chain of his in order to get a free pawn placement.
This is one of the games I presented at my son's preschool here in France, and the kids loved it. The teacher did too and kept requesting I leave it "just one more week..." :) Experience shows that five- or maybe six-years-old is the upper limit. But it's definitely great for the 3-5 range.

Great introduction to Carcassonne with big tile pieces and a simple game mechanic that even the 2 1/2 year can enjoy (even if the simple strategy is beyond her). 4 year-old like this, but not as much as Chicken Cha Cha Cha. Kids can quickly migrate to full Carcassonne (now 4 and 5 1/2).

My rating is based on my experience with my 6 year-old grand-son. My grand-son just loves this game. And he learned to be very good at it. After 40 plays with him, I can say that this game has developed the gaming fiber in my grand-son. Gradually we discussed different strategies to counterbalance the luck of the draw and place the tiles in a strategic way. After 10 plays, he could play strategically by himself and win. What a great game.

Who needs this game?  The original Carcassonne is an excellent, exceptional gateway-game which can be played by 6-year old children (we use the house rule that no meeples are placed on the meadows).


"The children of Carcassonne" is much simpler: 
Your goal is not to score points but to get rid of all your meeples.  All tiles have only roads on it and the road(s) always connect to all 4 sides of the tile.  In addition to that, 0-2 children of different colors are depicted on a tile.  Gameplay is really simple: draw a tile, place it on the board.  Whenever a road is finished, players put their meeples on the board according to the children depicted next to the road (e.g. if there are 2 red, 3 blue an 1 yellow children next to a finished road, the red player places 2 meeples, the blue player 3 meeples and the yellow player 1).  The player who gets rid of all his meeples first wins the game.

This game probably addresses children of ages 4-6 and probably works with these ages.  However the original game is much better and also playable with young children so I'd skip this one and go directly for the real thing.    


Edit: Another thing that bugs me is the confusing artwork.  For example it's really difficult to find the green children on the tiles.

If I had to pick my all time favorite young childrens game, this would be it. High quality components mixed with a simple yet fairly strategic game, equals a game I would gladly play with my son anytime he asked.

Trying to rate it from a kids perspective. I played it with my son (5.5yrs) and two nieces (6 and 8) all of them were able to understand the game well enough to play it (the younger two needed a bit of help from me). They all liked it and wantd to play more. SO I'd say this is a good choice for kids because you can play it with different ages at the same time. We playeed twice the first game and would have played more but it was too close to bed time.

For what it is, it gets the job done very well.  It's like a primer on tile-laying games for kids.  It's nice that every tile is playable in any location, they just have to decide which way benefits them the most.

I like that small children can learn to figure out what benefits them or doesn't benefit their opponents.  There's nothing there for adults or older children, but as a father it's wonderful to see your children begin to learn to make good decisions in games.

RATING: 8
This is a great game for kids, probably best for kids around 4 and up.  The tiles are high quality material, with a nice texture and the meeples look great.  In this version, all the tiles fit together regardless of location, and the trick of the game is to try to get all of your meeples down on the growing tile-based board, which happens when roads are completed (the road ends twice, i.e. has two endpoints).  Simple to play, but satisfying.  And for kids who are slightly older, they'll be able to think about the most tile-efficient way of getting their meeples down, so there is some very mild strategic value to gameplay.

I'm not sure that kids over the age of 7 or 8 will love this game, but for kids between 4-8, it's a very good starter game.

A Carcassonne Gyermekei nem kimondottan felnőtteknek készült játék. Ez persze nem azt jelenti, hogy nem élvezhetnénk a játékot vele. Az elemek kivitelezése gyönyörű. Nagyon szépek a rajzok, a lapkák pedig nagyobbak, vastagabbak az eredeti Carcassonne-ban lévő tájlapokhoz képest. Jó érzés kézbe venni az elemeket. Ahogy figyelem itt a BGG-en az értékeléseket, sokan furcsán pontozzák a gyerekjátékokat. Persze, ha a komolyabb stratégiákat igénylő játékokhoz hasonlítjuk a kisebbeknek készült társasokat, akkor valóban egyszerűbbnek, rövidebbnek, és variációs lehetőségekben szegényebbnek találjuk őket. Ugyanakkor szerintem óriási hiba egy kalap alá venni a különböző korosztály számára készült játékokat. És még ezen belül sem mindegy, hogy valamit már 4 évesen is lehet játszani, vagy csak 6 évesen. Óriási a különbség, és igazságtalannak tartom, hogy sok játék azért van alulpontozva, mert a felnőtt, bonyolultabb társasokhoz viszonyítják. Mondjuk a Carcassonne Gyermekei így sem panaszkodhat a helyezésére (na nem mintha számítana, hiszen úgyis csak a saját ízlésünk, tapasztalatunk dönti el, hogy valamit szeretünk-e vagy sem).
Remélem, hogy majd pár év múlva, amikor lányunk. Boglárka nagyobb lesz, sokat játszunk majd a Carcassonne Gyermekeivel is.

Really does seem to be fun for adults as well.  We made a mistake with this one though holding on to it a bit too long before trying it.  It does seem like our son would have been able to play it by Age 5 but we first played it when he was nearly Age 8.  At this point we feel he could handle the full base game of Carcassonne and that would challenge him some more.  There are also a lot of other tile laying games more appropriate for Age 8+.

4 year old son and 6 yr old niece like this one.  Not sure how it will be liked as they get older.   I've found the 4 year old BARELY gets the strategy while at 5 or 6 years old they really start to clue in how this one works.

Not at all for adults, that is why I rate it a 4.
For kids it is a 7 or 8 depending on age.

Catan Jr is a superior game for the 6-8 crowd.

I got this game for my nieces (then 5 and 2.5).  They enjoyed the game and understood many of the mechanics separately: how to place a tile, when a road is completed, what to do with your men.  Despite not putting all of these ideas together, each separate part was fun for them.  I'm sure that with some age and experience with the game, they'll work out how the mechanics actually incorporate.

However, as a cut-throat adult, playing this game to win is limited entirely by your tile draws.  It's impossible to block a move, and your best bet is to optimize the placement of your own colors.  It's a fascinating idea to place your meeples after features are complete, but the application is geared completely toward children.  Serious gamers should look elsewhere.  Those interested in playing with children have a clever gem on their hands.

RATING: 6
Rating is my own desire to play the game. Rating is higher as a kids game.

Kids of Carcassonne has lovely quality components, and if nothing else, it will teach your kids to appreciate the thick cardboard and solid wood tokens that are the hallmark of a good Euro.

The rules are fairly simple: you start with a set of 8 meeples, and on your turn, you place a tile onto the ever-growing city. All tiles have identical borders (a road on each edge) so there are no illegal placements to worry about. Each tile will show one or two persons on a road, corresponding to different player colours. When a road is terminated at both ends, any persons on that road are covered by corresponding player meeples, and the first player to be rid of their meeples wins. This is simple enough for adults, but it might take kids more than a couple of games to get the hang of this.

Adults may enjoy this as a filler; the game could easily be played in 10-15 minutes with 4 players.

KIDS GAME.

Much simpler than Carcassonne, and it seems just about right for little ones.  Can't wait till my son's old enough to play this!  

Update:  I've played it with him, but not with the official rules.  We take turns placing a tile, and then we put down the matching meeples on the tile, and the meeple color that runs out first wins.  Not a bad way to play with a little guy (age 3).

Light Carcassonne variant for young kids. Not much to it, would prefer to play real Carcassonne when my son gets older.

RATING: 7
I'm so glad this got reprinted! It stands out among other games for younger because it requires actual decision-making: Where do I put this tile? Can I help my color without helping anyone else? Should I gamble on a big scoring opportunity later or a quick one now? If I put it here, will it be easier or harder for others to take advantage of it?

And (at least with two players, which is how I've played it so far) it does all that with great components -- big, kid-friendly tiles and meeples, with great artwork on the tiles -- in about 10 minutes. For a game with just a couple of rules, easily learned and taught, I'm thrilled to find that it's both enjoyable and engaging for adults and kids alike.

Re-rated from an 8 to a 7. 11 plays in, at all player counts, this is still a solid game.

A pretty good kids implementation of Carcassonne. There really isn't much game here at all though. Like, literally none. You might get to make one semi-interesting decision a game, but beyond that, you can put the tiles anywhere you want. I understand it's for kids, but it would have been nice if they would have included some "modules" to introduce later that make this more of an actual game. Oh well, I'm still glad to own it, since we're such a big Carcassonne fans. It just won't be much use once our kids are past 6 or 7 years old.

I don't have enough friends nearby who enjoy a good tabletop game. So I usually settle for iOS Carcassonne games. I have a closet full of board and card games just collecting dust. My wife refuses to play with me. She hates losing. Somehow, I needed to either make more nerd friends or produce more on my own. I thought it easier to opt for the latter option. My first offspring is finally 3 and a half years of age, and I thought this would be prime time to begin her journey into board game geekdom. Enter My First Carcassonne, the perfect gateway drug. Simple enough for a three year old to play. She absolutely loves it! It has become a part of our bedtime routine, between book reading and teeth brushing. Highly recommended for all geek dads and moms wanting to spawn more lil' board game geeks.

I was looking forward to playing this, since my son really enjoys Castle Keep, which I didn't find to be much of  game. I figured he would like the tiles, and he did. For me, it felt more like Down Under or even Tsuro than it did the original Carcassonne. And I actually like Down Under quite a bit. Doesn't mean I like this as much, but it fits the bill being simple enough for a five-year-old, and enough actual game for a five-year-old's dad. Not as much as I thought it was going to be, but I guess that's not really relevant.

My 2 1/2 year old boy already plays this, not correctly but he gets the point of placing the colors when tiles are placed. I think it is a nice way for kids to start playing boardgames

update: a year after, my 3 1/2 year old son can play with the official rules. Maybe he does not get the full picture but he knows when to place meeples and when prompted he looks for the best way to place tiles in order to close a route and score the meeples in it.

Really suggest it for kids

For non-kids: (6/10) It's supersimplified Carcassonne. All pieces fit to each other and placement of meeples is reversed. There are pictures of children on tiles in 4 colors and whenever a section of road is completed then every player places his meeples on top of every pic. When you place your last piece, you win! Looks simple enough to be played with pretty young children and works as a short no-brains-needed-filler for gamers too.

[Children's Game] A Carcassonne variant where every tile always fits together. No scores are kept, you just try to get all your meeples on the board. The rules are extremely simple, so this is a nice game for 4-6 year old kids.

The tiles are very big and sturdy, and the artwork by Rolf Vogt is very nice, as always. The meeples are also larger than usually.

RATING: 5
Each tile has a road coming in from each side, but some stop, some continue, and each road may have a picture of a coloured meeple on it. The mission is to close off roads containing 8 of your meeples before anyone else. Sometimes this means a long road in your own colour, other times it means adding your colour to another long road that someone else will want to close. That's about the guts of the strategy, so it's for young kids only (6 and under maybe), and here at least each turn has a decision to be made so it's more interesting than a lot of kids games. Turns are fastish and it's all over quickly. Beautiful components enhance the game, but it's a very quiet game, not one of cheering and groaning, so it's not an instant replay game, more one of getting kids stepping up to thinking type game. Best with 4 (where all colours are used), then with 3, dullest with 2.

Not being a fan of Carcassonne, I was not really looking forward to playing this when my friend's six year old asked us to play. But it was really good. You are simply building the routes and place your meeple when a route is completed with one of your color's meeple on it. Great for kids and plays fast so adults can enjoy it without the long dull drag out of Carcassonne. We were three adults (all of which hate Carcassonne) and we all had fun.

For what this is I think it is a really solid game. It introduces a number of Boardgame concepts my 5-year-old is just becoming familiar with. It's balanced and fast and while there is a good amount of luck, and a superior player can figure out the best strategy after a couple of games there is still a random element that keeps it interesting. She really enjoys it. Even the storyline, which weirdly has NOTHING to do with the game.

This game is simple enough that young children can easily teach each other how to play, once they learn from an adult. The art is attractive and the components are very sturdy. The simplification does its job almost too well - once they master the concepts of placement and not necessarily helping other players complete map features, they are ready to move on to Carc proper. We received Carc as a gift recently, and Kids of Carc is not likely to be asked for, until younger relatives arrive.

Okey, okey. So the Carcassonne-brand got out of hand a long time ago. Which is starting to become the blessing for it at the same time, as there are almost no expectations on the titles that are released under the name and so was the case with the Kids of Carcassonne. So it's not the best game around for avid gamers or even for those who loved the original game so much, but the title does say "The Kids of..." and as a children's game this is one of the best. Yes, I said it. Carcassonne didn't just break the idea of how familygames should be, it has now also broken the children's game genre.

Carcassonne-ish in that you draw one tile and play it on your turn, but the scoring only comes from completed roads. Specifically, all tiles have four entry/exit points and some feature one (or more) small child in the four player colors. When a road is completed, all players with a child on that road get to place one (or more) meeples down on that road. First to place all 8 of their meeples is the winner. It's honestly a pretty decent introduction to getting opponents to do your work for you, aka the "shared incentive." Like with many other children's games, the window of opportunity for this one feels pretty narrow. But for now, my son enjoys it and requests it.

Jogo muito simples e engraçado, com ligeiro cheiro ao Carcassonne base, embora muito diferente, numa versão puramente infantil, ainda que feita com pés e cabeça, com meeples e desenhos bem coloridos, bem como tiles fortes e resistentes. Merece o preço que custa e creio que deva ser jogado como um jogo absolutamente independente e não como uma introdução ao universo “Carcassonne”.

RATING: 7
This is accessible to very young players. The jury is still out on whether they prefer this to original Carcassone with significant modifications. Why? Young children feel a sense of achievement from the 'jigsaw' element of Carcassone which is largely remeoved from 'Kids of.' However, my children are not yet old enough to appreciate any of the tactics of 'Kids of' (the oldest got it for her 5th Birthday). 
Whilst there is no overall strategy, there are at least a handful of tactics that should determine the outcome of most games between those who do and don't know them.

Very hard to come up with a rating, as I haven't played a single game by the rules. Instead, I've toyed with the game components with my 2 year old daughter. First we put all the tiles together and then placed matching pawns onto the characters pictured in tiles. She loved it and that's about the only thing that matters with this game.

RATING: 8
I was demoing children's games for my local (now defunct) game store, and this was hands down the most popular. The children would play a game, then immediately get in line and wait for another turn. They loved placing the tiles, and they watched like hawks for the roads to close, even if it was to help their opponents place their meeples.  

The thing is, it wasn't boring for the adults, either. Gsmes that can bridge that gap are rare.

A charming little game to pull out when there are kids over.

RATING: 3
This game is really a dud for kids over about four years old. My seven year old sees this for the luck fest it is. There's almost no decision making beyond closing off your roads in a way that doesn't aid your opponent. It's hard for me to see adults getting any joy playing this with their kids. The bits are nice, but the game itself is just too simplistic and too dull.

A fun game for the kids, helps them really think about things as they place tiles.  With some light coaching, helping them find moves that benefit themselves and hinder others can help them prepare for playing more complex games.  Definitely recommended if you have younger gamers-to-be in your house.

Enjoyable junior version of the proper game. It encourages tactical thinking and can be played either friendly or competitively. It's also played to completion in 15 minutes which makes it suitable for younger children with shorter attention spans.

All the children from non-gaming families that have played it with us have really enjoyed it.

Wow! What a hit with the 4 year-old... and the just-turned-2 year old, who's placing tiles and meeples quite happily (though not really knowing why). She adds to the random factor, but this will always be remembered as the first ever game that the 4 of us in the family could all play together; it's also cemented, for the rest of our lives, that I'm red, wife is yellow, Robbie's blue and wee Emma is green.

My rating is based on the perspective of young children and their parents, at whom this game is aimed.

With that in mind, I can truly say that this is great Carcassonne variant for the young ones. It requires tactics rather than memory or dexterity, so in that respect, it's a true 'gateway' game. My daughter of five loves it, and I love it seeing her make her very first tactical moves in a game. Even her two year old sister plays along merrily, happy to place the tiles and put the kiddiemeeples when prompted to. The big tiles with very nice illustrations greatly add to the enjoyment we get out of it.

So yes, in a way, this is my favourite member of the Carcassonne family.

RATING: 5
[RGG 2009 edition] {Carcassonne, racing; tile-laying; optimal 3-4p} {Adult 5, kids 8} Impulsive pre-order.  However, it is an interesting children game, although it is somewhat complicated for children under 6.  Gone is the tactical placement of pawns as there is only one feature, the road, to score.  And, it becomes a race game, in which players compete to place all their pawns first.  This game falls in the categories of competitive-cooperative because you cannot score alone and you have to work with other players in order to complete a road and score.  Nice twist of Carcassonne for children.  Recommended.

The components are excellent.  The pawns are cute. The illustration is also cute.  The color tone is attractive.  The tiles are large enough for children.  Thumb up!

This rating is vicariously done through my child as this is aimed at children and not adults. She loves playing it and I don't mind playing it with her. We play 2 player and 3 player and it's better with more players. She loves placing the meeples, laying tiles and has picked up various game strategies. Also, this game is built extremely well. The tiles are durable, the meeples are made out of wood and the bright colors are nice to look at. When the time comes, transitioning to the full version of Carcasonne should be seamless.

EDIT: Rating Change from 8-7.

I think there's a very narrow window of development where this game is actually good for kids. Really little kids (3-4yo) can have fun laying down tiles and playing with meeples, but will struggle to understand the concept of "completion" and/or struggle to process the visual elements on the board. But by age 7, even kids can see that there's little to do beyond trying to stack up your own color children or complete your existing roads most of the time. So, at best, I'd say this is a decent game for 5-6 year olds. But I've moved my own 6yo's onto regular Carcassonne (minus farmers, with 3 fewer meeples than standard) and that seems perfectly accessible and a lot more interesting for everybody. 

If this is ever reprinted and you have kids of the right age, it's worth picking up. But it's not even close to being worth multiple times the MSRP for an OOP copy. There's no shortage of good kids games out there these days.

A cute game that the kids enjoyed. As soon as it was opened they were putting the tiles together and placing the kids,. They liked the fact that they were kids, I guess it makes the whole game sound like more fun. Khan was very excited when he placed a tile correctly, giving out hi fives. I decided not to bust his bubble and didn't let him know the roads all fit together.

This is a GREAT skill-based, almost-zero-luck game to play with young kids.  In fact, even my wife enjoyed a few playthroughs.  Teaching the game is extremely easy, but it allows for plenty of strategy-building, as you try to maximize each turn and keep your opponents from getting easy points - or at the very least, making sure you score alongside them!  The only luck comes into play as cards are drawn - cards that don't feature your player color obviously won't let you score, but this can be mitigated by separating the tiles into additional stacks.  Also, the colors are pretty well spread across the cards, so you won't go long without seeing your color appear somewhere on the board.  I love watching my daughter play this game - I love seeing her consider her options and start to plan ahead.  I'm a proud, gaming pappa!

My three year old has just got in to this game. I think it is excellent for kids and totally recommend it. It has just enough tactical play for small children to find it challenging and interesting without being too simplistic. Obviously my three year old needs quite a bit of help with it but I would anticipate that by the time he is four he will be making all his own decisions and will put up a good fight.

However, even though there is enough interest for an adult who is playing with a child, the main entertainment  will be playing with the child, I don't think there is enough in this game for adults on their own.

Rated an 8 from my three year olds point of view. For me it's a 4.

[2012-11-17]good if played with non-boardgames-playing children

[2015-03-29]my youngest child loves it, just because it's full of colors and little animals. he has no idea of the tactics involved but he is slowly grasping the concept of "closed road" and the need to close doors. so far so good.

Played with the kids 7yrs and 4yrs. They both love it. The 4yr old loves the tiles and my 7yr old is into the strategy of it, won't be long and she'll be playing the big version. All in all this game is money well spent. It is a great kids version of the original.

Easy to learn with some simple tactics. This is a perfect children's game that plays in under 15 minutes. The components are very well made and nicely illustrated. Easily in my top 5 for games for younger children (under 6) and still enjoyable for under 9's. If you're looking for good games for younger children have a look at Bugs in the Kitchen and Viva Topo.

RATING: 7.5
Fun game to play with kids. This is similar to, but much better than, "Legend of Landlock." Can be played by very young kids just fine.

Rating assumes playing with kids. With adults, this drops way down to a 3 or 4.

Nice kids'version of Carcassonne. Can't wait to play the real game with my daughter!

RATING: 8
Really neat game for kids that can give them an early start on tile-laying games.

It also can be used to help teach them patience - they often have to be reminded that they can't place their meeples until after completing a road.

The chunky meeples remind me of South Park characters.

Very fun kids game. There is at least a little bit of tactical play involved and the look and gameplay are so nice that I think we will be coming back to it time and time again.

This is a kids game so I am not rating it in geek scale.

Nice components, but I don't think a four year old can understand the concept of closing a road. And by the time they do understand it, 6 or 7, this game is too bland and they are better off playing regular Carcassonne instead.

Die Kinder von Carcassonne is a great adaptation of the original game and perfect for young children. It looks great, features very good components and is simple and quick. It feels like a simplified Carcassonne and a good introduction to the game. My youngest daugther Ella has enjoyed this since she was 5 years old, and we're still playing it now that she's 11.

I highly recommend this to parents of young kids.

Lo juego con mis sobrinos, es al que más jugamos, creo que es un buen regalo para niños. Es un juego muy facilito pero tiene su miga, la suficiente para que los nenes empiecen a pensar en estrategias.

That rating is relative to other kids games.  As a grownup game this is no more than a 5... or maybe 6 with the "rainbow variant" where everybody gets a pair of meeples in each color.  

The components are just great.  Big thick tiles each with unique artwork and the big chunky meeples are fun just to hold.  The game itself is a very clever take on traditional Carcassonne.  I find even high schoolers having trouble making everything match in regular Carc so making every tile fit every space every time is genius for little kids.  I did find there to be a pleasant bit of pre-planning in your tile placement as well giving opportunities to make it easier (or harder) to finish long paths though luck of the draw is always a factor.

One of the better starter game for kids.  Simple, but some good decision making on where and how to place the tiles.

RATING: 7
Simplified, incorporating scoring into the game by the fact that getting all your guys on the board wins it for you, but you only place them when a road depicting kids of your color is closed, at which point you place a meeple on each kid on the closed road.  Still, it feels like there are strategic choices to make.

Todas las losetas coinciden. Cuando se complete un camino los jugadores colocan una de sus figuras sobre cada niño de su color en el camino. Quien se quede sin fuguras gana.

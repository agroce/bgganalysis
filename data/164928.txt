I was really disappointed in this one. I did not like the randomness of the bag pulls (and I have come to like Hyperborea). I generally despise strategy games that use random event decks. If you fall behind early in one of the tracks, it can be a long game just to finish out the stretch in what you know is a losing game.

I can also see this feeling very samey after just a few plays.

RATING: 6
Fun bag-building game, albeit one with minimal interaction between players and low setup variability.

As much as I enjoyed my first few plays I found most people did similar things, and haven't felt any desire to play it again.

RATING: 8
Lots of freedom and very little downtime. This game has a good tempo to it. There's two reasons it's not a 9. Firstly it's a little bit too open/sandboxy to fully satisfy my taste. Secondly it's so non-confrontational that it almost feels like playing solitaire (it makes games like Suburbia and Race for the Galaxy, both of which I love, seem like all out war).

I have to point out that I strongly disagree with the people who talk of this game as having a significant luck factor. It might seem so after one play or two, but it's really not that hard to stay in control. You can let pieces stay on the board instead of forcing it to play as many actions as possible each turn. That way you you can plan ahead and keep the randomness slightly lower. You can also get rid of discs by doing good deeds.

RATING: 7
Very thinly themed game occurring in a time period when the French were fighting the 100 year war.  What makes this game work is the variability, the unique "bag building" mechanic, and the ease of play.

The game occurs over 18 rounds, which sounds like a lot but actually plays very quickly.  Each round, the following happens: 1) flip a random event (very similar to Pillars of the Earth where some are good and more are bad), this event will occur later in the round so you have some time to plan for it, 2) reward and penalize the most and least industrious farmers (gave a gold or lose a gold), 3) draw and assign your workers to your own private action board.  This is the meat of the game, you have a bag that you can potentially fill (or even thin) with workers of varying types and these all have specific powers/rewards whenever you gain them and different action spaces require certain workers (colour of worker, red, white, brown, etc.).  The actions are typically get more workers of a type and gain the corresponding bonus (and you want more of EVERYTHING because it's all good!), travel on the map in order to gain valuable goods, or build trading posts on the map which are worth end game points and for which space is limited and first come first serve.  You can also assign workers to go away and perform feats/jobs for which they receive a small reward but you never get them back (you want to do this to a) thin your bag, b) gain the small bonuses, c) potentially snipe the larger citizen bonus). 4) after workers are placed, they are assigned, which essentially means you fill up your board as best you can and when it's your turn choose to activate an action (or not).  5) finally resolve the event, then pass the start player, rinse and repeat.

Points are scored for: a) money (and no this is not pittance points, it can be VERY significant), b) goods (they range from 1-5 points each), c) the sum of your built trading posts and citizens (not workers) times your multiplier on the prestige track (this is awarded primarily through acquiring and activating the gray worker).  There are also a large selection of unique special buildings, ala Caverna, that can be acquired through the black worker, and several of these can be used to score you points (they're essentially private action spaces).

The game plays quickly and smoothly as long as everyone assigns workers simultaneously (being able to adjust last minute if they're later in turn order) and once familiarity with the special buildings is attained.  It seems to play very well, albeit a bit differently from 2-4 players, and there is an option to play 5 (not sure I would want to due to downtime).  Seems to be several ways to play it/specialize and lots of potential for expansions (in the way of special buildings).  Very nice components provided you have upgraded wooden pieces.

First play rating, so may change over time. Excellent bag-building game with elegant rules and nice depth of decision-making. The game is easy to teach and interesting throughout. Our game came down to a one point difference. The artwork is a little on the dull side and components aren't anything to write home about, but there's plenty of 3rd party upgrades. The game itself is rock solid and no one path immediately seems more effective than another. Turns are fast and the game plays very smoothly. Overall, lovely.

RATING: 8.5
Great bag buidling system.

8.2 Points only with 

1) the official correction for the "Badehaus" 

2) Harvest house rule, which creates some extra tension and makes weak bzuildings stronger:
You have to pay one food the first time (normal rule), but 2 the 2nd time and 3 the third time.
No harvest event can follow directly another harvest event (in case, reshuffle and draw again)

3) in case of not enough coins left to pay out an event, don't pay out to anyone (instead start player first).
Alternatively play with unlimited coin supply

4) free promo Tiles "Tavern" and "Depot" included in the game

Still rooom for improvent in several detals and the buildings (cheesery and hayrick much too weak e.g.)

Could rise even to a 9 with expansion, if some details like the above are fixed and potential in buildings and events is better used.

Update: Get the Expansion "Trade & Intrigue", which fixes most of the weaknesses the base game had, then you can forget what I wrote above. So it's a 9 point game with that expansion (Event module and extra locations, maybe contract module, too, new deeds board optional (but not the intrigue one, which is crazy). If you use new deeds board, Game should be shortened 1-2 rounds.

RATING: 7
6 plays / 4,5 players

LIKE: Even though it's just another efficiency race game, there is lots to explore. The multitude of strategies is very fun and the main point of the game. Gameplay was smooth. Nice thick tokens (TMG version). Good 5 player game (I have additional player pieces).

DISLIKE: Money wasn't tight, so the events seemed pointless. Goods gained weren't used for anything but points, so that felt bland. Lacks player interaction at times. Rules weren't complete, felt they left some questions unanswered.

OVERALL: Good game, but I am surprised this is rated as high as it is. I do like it because of the sheer amount of strategies to pursue, but the lack of tension in the game gave it a somewhat mild aftertaste. I am eager to expansions to make the game a little edgier. (Upgraded rating after a few plays.)

This is a really smooth, easy to play Euro system - drawing out characters and playing simultaneously (and yet competing over important aspects). It has a fast race feeling of taking opportunities away from opponents while always building something unique for yourself. The end game scoring is very smooth as well - only resources, coins and a multiplier for guild houses and citizens. Excellent game in every respect.

RATING: 6
Orléans is a quite nice engine building game. You start with limited possibilities but continuously expand your horizons. I especially enjoyed that the game rewards long term strategies, i.e., at the start you choose the way you want to go and push it all the way through. This is really nice since you can make a great master plan, and then just try to execute it.

It seems that most strategies are more or less equally competitive meaning that the outcome will be decided on the tactical level. You need to phase your actions so that you always get what you need at the right time. Some strategies involve more direct competition with the opponents while others allow for you to fondle your own stuff mostly. This might be an issue especially with four players if three decide to race against each other while the fourth player can proceed at a pace of his own.

At first, you might think that the game would be awfully long with 18 full rounds. However, the 90 minutes playing time is actually quite true provided that everyone allocates their workers on action spaces simultaneously. I really think this is the only valid way to play, since 18 rounds would just be too long if everyone pondered every single move for a few minutes. The setup is a bit long, though.

One decision I did not fancy, though, was that all extra buildings are available right from the start. This creates an unnecessary vast decision tree and leaves novices and beginner level players flabbergasted. Moreover, it is easy to think of a tight game with experts who want to analyze everything very carefully and thus freezing the game due to too many options available.

In a nutshell, I enjoyed Orléans but there is nothing exceptional to it. There are some (minor) issues with the vastness of the decision tree but you can adopt a strategy which allows you to take a more straightforward approach and ignore the tree completely.

RATING: 7.5
The term "bag builder" (as opposed to a "deck builder") is often used to describe this game, and the term is apt.  Many of the same thought processes go into playing this game that go into deck building games like Dominion.  As in Dominion, putting together a particularly effective combination of workers in your bag can lead to a strong engine that can crush the opposition, but can also lead to repetitive play that doesn't require much thinking once the engine is humming.  Unlike base-game Dominion, there are things the opponents can do to slow you down and try to indirectly disrupt your engine.

The game is interesting and has a feeling of progression as you put together an engine, but if you are able to get things running too smoothly, you can spend much of the game doing the same thing over and over again, which is tedious.  This isn't always the case, however, and there are many paths to take toward victory in the game.

All in all, Orleans is a solid, mid-weight Euro with an interesting blend of mechanisms.

The game reminds me of one of those early Abercrombie fantasy books. Nice idea, beautiful story, but throw away half of the overflowing content and nobody would really notice. In fact, the game/book would have been much better without it. 

I like the overall idea of having different kinds of workers to place on interesting actions, the road network for addition perks is nice, but what do I need this extra court for? I mean, I see the idea, getting rid of useless workers for some extra bonus, but its just ... too ... much for one game.

Bag builder / worker placement game. Sometimes I wish there would be more variety when setting up the game.

LOVE IT!  A bag-oriented, worker-placement deck builder.  And so well done!

My biggest criticism is that some directions/strategies are just inherently more powerful than others.  This includes some of the buildings as a few of them are just plain *better* than most of the others.  I know, you can knock some of them out to force variety, but the bigger picture of the game shouldn't depend on the players balancing out one another's strategies.

It may be that the expansion fixes some of this?  Not sure yet.

Rating may improve with additional plays/exposure.

I think this is my favorite, "Gateway to non-gateway games game".  It takes a solid 20 minutes to explain the game to someone, as long as they know something about games, but the game play is actually pretty simple.  The funny thing is that a new player will not know how terrible they are at it until the end, when the scores are all added up.  Every time I play, I figure out a little more about how to build points, which revolves around mitigating the randomness of drawing tiles from your bag every round.  

My only complaint is the same complaint I have with games like Puerto Rico.  It's a little too similar to Chess in the way that, a new player has almost no chance at doing well the first few plays.  And the really experienced players can get WAY too caught up in trying to have perfect strategy.  The only solution is to just have fun with it and not pay attention to those who say you're doing it wrong.  You're probably doing it wrong, but who cares, have fun)

I know that this competitiveness is what causes a lot of people to say they don't like teaching the game to new players.  But I would much rather teach it to someone new than play against an Orleans grand-master who has spent years developing the perfect path to the most points.

RATING: 7
Πολύ ευχάριστο eurogame που συνδυάζει γνωστούς και δοκιμασμένους μηχανισμούς όπως το deck building με το worker placement. Ουσιαστικά στο παιχνίδι όλοι ξεκινούν με 4 εργάτες τους οποίους τους τοποθετείς στο προσωπικό σου ταμπλό για να ενεργοποιήσεις κάποια actions. Σταδιακά αποκτάς και άλλους εργάτες, χτίζεις κτήρια, ταξιδεύεις στο χάρτη, μαζεύεις προϊόντα και άλλα κλασσικά euro πράγματα. 

Οι εργάτες είναι σε διάφορα χρώματα και για κάθε action απαιτείτε συγκεκριμένος συνδυασμός χρωμάτων. Κάθε γύρα τραβάς από το σακούλι σου ορισμένους εργάτες και τους τοποθετείς όπου κρίνεις εσύ χρήσιμο. Αν δεν ολοκληρώσεις το συνδυασμό των χρωμάτων μπορείς να αφήσεις τους εργάτες εκεί, με την ελπίδα ότι την επόμενη γύρα θα τραβήξεις το χρώμα που σου λείπει.

Από την στιγμή που ο καθένας φτιάχνει την μηχανή του και παίζει στο προσωπικό του ταμπλό το interaction είναι αρκετά περιορισμένο. Υπάρχει όμως ο χάρτης της Γαλλίας στον οποίο οι παίκτες μετακινούνται και ανοίγουν καταστήματα (χωράει ένα σε κάθε πόλη οπότε όποιος προλάβει χτίζει) ενώ και ο αριθμός των εργατών είναι μικρός για κάθε χρώμα.

Σε κάθε γύρο συμβαίνει και ένα random event, το οποίο γίνεται γνωστό από την αρχή του γύρου και έτσι προλαβαίνεις να προετοιμαστείς. Υπάρχει και μια δόση τύχης στο παιχνίδι αφού κάθε γύρα τραβάς τυχαία τους εργάτες σου.

Στα θετικά να βάλω πως υπάρχουν διάφοροι τομείς για να ασχοληθεί κάποιος, οπότε το παιχνίδι έχει ψωμί αλλά από την άλλη δεν είμαι σίγουρος για το replayability καθώς κάθε φορά όλα τα κτήρια είναι διαθέσιμα. Επίσης δεν με ικανοποίησε η ποιότητα παραγωγής. Τόσο δύσκολο θα ήταν οι εργάτες να ήταν ξύλινα δισκάκια αντί για tokens??

Μας πήρε 2 και κάτι ώρες για μια παρτίδα τεσσάρων παικτών.

Γενικά το παιχνίδι μου άφησε μια ευχάριστη αίσθηση και δεν θα έλεγα όχι σε μια παρτίδα. Απλά κάποιες λεπτομέρειες δεν το αφήνουν να ξεχωρίσει. Για κάποιο λόγο πιστεύω πως θα μπορούσε να είναι πολύ καλύτερο από ότι είναι. Ίσως φταίει που δεν είναι αρκετά σφιχτό και πως τα events είναι πολύ χλιαρά.

Played this a half dozen times the last two weeks and I am a bit obsessed with the game.  My last session involved a strategy that completely overwhelmed my opponents. My guess is that it is not as dominant as it seemed, but was a function of a bit of good luck and lack of competition from my opponents for the actions I was focused on.  Just an 8 for now but will go up unless future plays become too stereotyped.

A tile drafting game that feels fresh, original and amusing to play.  I had a lot of fun playing it for the first time.

Orleans feels like a mellow combination of Dominion and Castles of Burgundy with additional "special buildings," "traveling on a map and building houses," and climbing on the various bonus tracks to get benefits.

Bottom line:  I think Orleans is a fun, worthy addition to the euro game library.  Should be in the top 200 at least.

The bag building with workers works really well here. The game also feels tense and interesting most of the way through. 

The fiddliness of the end game due to the importance of turn order reduces some of the fun. I have deducted 1 from the rating due to that.

Orleans is a worker drafting and placement game with various ways to collect victory points. Use different combinations of workers to obtain additional more valuable workers, who in turn help up upgrade you farming, progress, civil, maritime, castle and university skills. Each of these skills provides different ways to obtain victory points. All of your goods, money and properties earn victory points at the end...most VP wins!

The bag building in this game adds a layer of fun and chance that you don't often experience in comparable Euro games. The actions are all smooth and intuitive, the only learning curve is just remembering what they each do, learning the tiles and how you rank up along the various tracks when claiming the different worker tokens. Cute art, and this is ultimately a good medium weight game for those who have 'graduated' from gateway worker placement, say...Stone Age, with the bag mechanic here replacing that minor element of randomness from the die rolling. Believe the hype, this is worth your while.

3/21/16: This game is a lot of fun, and plays very smoothly.  Need to get the expansions from DLP.  With upgraded DLP components this is beautiful. 

A deck builder without cards.  You throw your acquired meeples into a draw bag.  There is a separate board where you can permanently place your less valuable meeples to "thin your deck."  The variety in the game comes from the different buildings that are used each time.

Certainly not a heavy game, but lots of fun.  I think that this was one of my favorite games at Gamestorm, and playing it there convinced me to pick it up.

Want to order the following from DLP: a) Fan Kit, b) Ostkarten #2, c) Ostkarten #3 4) Scorepad

Plays well with 4 and 5, but 5 makes the board crowded.

This is the most impressive game I played at EuroQuest 2014. It essentially is a medium-weight point-salad that has a healthy amount of tension as players race to certain VP-scoring opportunities. But it has a "deck-building" element where players draw action tokens out of a bag, which were added in previous turns; thus, the random element is strongly influenced by the decisions you made earlier (Action tokens you purchased or kept on the board). There is also an event deck but those cards tend to affect players at the end of the round. So the end result is a game that provides meaningful decisions and handles/controls randomness very well. 

Component wise... not the best. The browns/blacks are too close together, the action tokens are obnoxiously thin to pick up, and the game did seem to age worst than other games (aka... ink coming off, seams on player board showing, etc). Is it bad... no. Could it be better... yes. I'd say gamers would be very please with this 5-10 years ago but with publishers pushing industry standards... it ends up looking average.

Take a mechanism I already like a lot (deck building), add some economic engine to the mix, and some disaster mitigation. A middle weight game (my favorite weight), full of tough decisions with a low range (my favorite kind of decision making), and some strategic depth. It's almost as if was describing my all time favorite (El Grande) with some different mechanisms, but the same "feel".

I love this game. It might very well climb up to a perfect 10 in the near future, with more plays.

Kicsi hiányzik ahhoz, hogy egy igazán jó játék legyen, de azért volt pár dolog, ami zavart... Pl. mindjárt az első, hogy a hosszához és fajsúlyához képest borzasztóan sok kütyü van benne, fél óra az előkészület. Mellesleg a játék sem olyan rövid, mint amilyennek ígéri a doboza, nekünk tisztán 2 és fél óra volt 3 fővel, pedig a szabály a hossza ellenére sem bonyolult. Valahol nekem a könnyed és a komoly határán mozog. Egyébként a grafika beszédes, a játék jól néz ki, de miért csak ennyi 1-es pénzt adtak hozzá? A szabály nem tér ki rá, mi történik, ha sehova sem tudjuk letenni az embereket. Foglalja a helyet? Van egy külön játéktábla, ahová véglegesen el lehet passzolni az embereket némi pénzért vagy könyvért. De sajátot nem tehetünk oda. Nos valamiért ezt mindannyian elrontottuk, vagy mi vagyunk nagyon bénák, vagy ez egy erőltetett szabály amire nehéz figyelni:)
De van ami meg kifejezetten tetszett, pl. a zsákos dolog az jó. 
Azt írtam az elején, hogy kevés hiányzik, hogy igazán jó legyen: talán a letisztultság hiányzik, még egy kis tesztelés nem ártott volna. Egy nagyon kicsi.

I liked the idea of the bag building mechanism, and even enjoyed the game for some time. However I do have a couple of issues with the game. First of all it overstayed its welcome. Everybody said it played a bit too long (2h with 3 players). 18 rounds turned out to be too long. At the beginning of the game you have many options, but can only do 1-2 actions a rounds. Later in the game you have a lot of capabilities, but a number of actions diminishes, which is irritating. On the other hand if it weren't for this aspect interaction would be even scarcer. And this smoothly leads us to the second problem. This is mainly a multiplayer solitaire. Hardly ever do you interact with other players. The map where you wander with your merchant is so big that all 3 players easily maneuvered over there. Only by the end of the game did we look at the Town's Hall to see whether somebody is about to snatch the citizen of the auxiliary board. Overall, I like euro games and indirect interaction, but this one lacked interaction even for my taste.

Overall, it was an ok game, but there are small chances it will hit the table again, there are simply better picks for this time span. I have just put it on our local Polish MathTrade.

Sin expansiones es un gran juego con expansiones es de lo mejorcito que puedas encontrar, la expansión trade & intriga debería venir con el juego básico, arregla pequeños defectos del básico (como la repetición de eventos) y le da un plus brutal con los dos tableros externos, uno para la gente constructiva (sin interacción directas entre jugadores) y otro para la destructiva (mucha interacción para hacer la puñeta). El fan kit es muy recomendable para cambiar los tokens de personajes por madera y añadir el 5 jugador que funciona perfectamente. Y la expansión Invasión mete escenarios que le dan rejugabilidad y aunque no lo parezca convierte un juego competitivo en uno colaborativo que funciona. ¡Increíble bag-building!.

RATING: 7.5
"Bag building" seem the theme of 2014. And Orleans is probably the game that best implements the mechanic.

Every turn players draw a certain number of followers from their bag, and use them to "activate" various different locations, giving them more followers or moving a merchant on a map, or gaining various kinds of goods or money.

There are twenty buildings with various special powers: when players acquire a building they have a unique access to it, and to a more powerful version of one of the basic actions, or to a different unique power.

The game is charming and engaging, and the only critique I can move is the lacking of a true engine building: most activities let players earn goods or money, and these are basically just different ways of define victory points.

A very good game: initial tentative rating is 7.5.

Initial Impression: So far I've only played this as a cooperative game but my first impression is very favorable. I'm a sucker for a well implemented deckbuilding mechanism and this game has certainly hit the target. There's a feeling of multiple options for every chit pulled from the bag, and you never feel as if your pull was useless. Thematic mechanisms are also in place to "thin your deck" when needed. Although the cooperative game has no "AI", the targets needded to win are challenging and require coordination from every player in order to succeed. This game is slick, flows quickly, and is easy to teach.

A game I like immediatly because of the obvious rules, the clear gameplay and the nice gameflow. Strategic but not very difficult. Exciting till the end.

After third play we decided to let the Bath house in the box. In all of the three games, the player with the bath house was too strong. But for the rest still a very lovely game.

RATING: 7.5
Interesting concept of "bag-building". Character tiles could be better quality as they are regularly handled and would be easier to pull out of bag if were thicker. Hopefully this will be fixed in the "deluxe" version. Initially lots of different options, however I think certain paths will be better than others.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Orleans is a game that, to win, you must implement an effective strategy. However, the game still gives you, from round to round, a sense of accomplishment and progression if you happen to play badly. Combine the sense of progression with its ease of teaching and you have an accessible strategy game. Additionally, through the bag pulls, each round provides some tactical-level decision making. Interaction with other players is largely subtle and turn-order based. For example, you race to complete areas on the town hall board before other players or race nearby players to build trading depots. 

The game offers you a number of strategies to pursue, but places all the burden on the players to make Orleans feel replayable and different from play to play. The game play of Orleans does not force players to try those different strategies. You will also be funneled towards diversifying in at least some ways, as it does not seem viable to employ a strategy that completely ignores certain point-scoring aspects of the game. 

Every non-worker item you collect in the base game is, basically, a representation of a certain number of victory points. Due to this, Orleans feels hollow -- you go through the game's motions simply because the game wants you to and not because you want to achieve something aside from victory points. As mapped to the game's mechanisms, you move forward round to round collecting workers, collecting resources, building trading depots, and the like, but you only do so because that is the way you collect victory points. 

Interestingly, the Invasion expansion and the upcoming Trade & Intrigue expansion appear to make attempts at addressing the preceding paragraph's criticism. The core mechanisms of Orleans are interesting enough that I look forward to trying out Trade & Intrigue when the TMG version is released, and I will be attempting some Invasion content very soon. However, I expected more out of the base game.

Edit, Sept 2017: Invasion bumps this rating up a bit, but it changes the overall feel of Orleans enough that I rated Invasion on its own. I rate Invasion a strong 7, but base Orleans a 6.

Je begint met 4 mannetjes en gaat er extra halen.
Worker placement in zekere zin, maar toch, je blokkeert eigenlijk nooit de anderen.  Je kan hen alleen VOOR zijn om iets interessanters te nemen.

Veel strategieën mogelijk.

Makkelijk te begrijpen door heldere symbolen, en makkelijke regels voor de eindtelling.

Geluk: welke van je mannetjes trek je uit je zakje.  Kan best frustrerend zijn als niet de juiste eruit komen.  Ik heb al veel gevloekt op dit spel.
Weinig interactie met elkaar, doch juist genoeg.  Weinig downtime doordat een aantal zaken samen of tegelijkertijd kunnen gebeuren.

I had high hopes for this one, but after a few plays it dawned on me that it won't stay long.

The bag-building is interesting and could surely be built upon. However, for my taste Orleans [b]really[/b] lacks long-term replay-value.
Only the map part of the board has some randomness when setting up the game. Unfortunately the travelling part of the game is subpar and not viable without expansions.
Thus we're left with an optimisation puzzle where over time a dominant strategy will emerge, and only the luck of the draw shakes things up a bit.

Furthermore the game lacks any meaningful or direct player interaction.

Fell in love with this game immediately even though more than 10 over rules were played wrongly in the first game. Euro bag-building point salad game with depth that plays fast cause planning phase happens simultaneously. Only thing preventing it from scoring a 10 is the set-up time and slight concern about the replayability as there seems to be only one main winning strategy. 

This is one of those rare Euro game that you enjoy because it is fun instead of being brain-burning.

Bag building instead of deck building; there's even a bag thinning mechanic employed... Other than that, Orleans brings nothing new or innovative, but dang... there's something I like about this game! 

The game brought a certain charm and appeal to it after playing it a few times in as far as trying to get an engine going by getting specific tiles and chits. There are some nice combos with the tiles. Replayability is suspect, but enjoying the ride at the moment. 

The mid weight level might make it a good game for family/non gamers.

Nice alternative take on the deck building genre. I had fun in each of my three plays so far. One slight concern is that deckbuilders usually get their replayability from the variable setup (see Dominion) and while there is SOME variability in setup in Orleans, it is quite limited and not necessarily something that will wildly affect your overall strategy.

Orleans has some neat ideas with assigning different workers from tiles drawn in a bag to generate new workers and other, useful things. It's sort of a "worker-building" game. While I did enjoy the game, I expected more from it. The main point-scoring mechanics on the map were very dull. Overall thematic integration was really missing. It's a good game and I will play it again, but it did underwhelm compared with my expectations. 

Year and a half later, I played this for the second time and it was quite a bit better. The TMG production is very nice and I think there were expansions in the game. Not sure about the amount of replay ability but I doubt I'll play it enough for that to matter.

This is a game I'd like playing once in a while, but I will most likely not ask for it, if better (and more complex) Euro Games like Puerto Rico, Agricola, or Caylus are available. In the same range of complexity I would prefer Lancaster, Hansa Teutonica, or Concordia.

Really enjoying this. The "pulling stuff out of a bag" aspect adds the perfect level of randomness for me. You can control what's in the bag, but not exactly what you will get. My biggest worry is that it might be too balanced. There are a number of strategic paths to take, but scores are usually very close. Sometimes I am not sure what I did to lose, or win. I think that the player that best adapts to what is pulled from the bag wins, and that I can certainly support. I need more plays to be sure about this though.

Initial Impressions:
---------------------
This one felt really unique.  It's the "bag" building, but it felt very different than Hyperboria.  Ton's of tough choices, and I felt like it offered enough ways to mitigate the luck factor to make it very interesting.  While I think the engine is really cool, wasn't to keen on the moving your trader and building trading houses.  Felt like with the engine they had they could of done something more interesting that had more player interaction.  Because of this, I don't think this one will ever move up to being a great game for me, but I thought it was really good, and I expect to play it a ton going forward!

Draw bags (player tokens)

// This is one of those games where I was initially kind of
overwhelmed by what it looked like and how much stuff is in
the box, but once we sat down and played it, it's actually
quite simple. It feels somewhat like multiplayer solitaire
at the 2-player count, but it's still fun because it 
presents an interesting puzzle, and there's still a bit of
player interaction. More fun with 4 than with 2, though.

I really enjoy playing this game. It is a classic euro where You're trying to build Your own mechanism for points scoring. I would say this is kind of a sandbox game where You will find many buildings, ways etc and mix them to make a perfect connection between them. Bag building is great (draft from the bag is exciting) - in the game You can protect Yourself against randomness. If You forget about it You will probably lose. Higher You set randomness in this game You have bigger chances to lose in the end and be frustrated during strategy planning. This is awesome euro game which is better and better after every play. 

- Deluxe edition is worth every penny (wood instead of cardboard tiles & 5th player and the like).
- Very solid game overall.
- Theme? Game is dry.

I am exceptionally impressed with how intuitively the mechanics interact with the strategy in Orleans. Even though Orleans' gameplay contains a myriad of choices and the occasional bout of analysis paralysis, the game often feels incredibly streamlined because the resulting decisions and outcomes amalgamate into an extremely elegant, cohesive, and satisfying game.

This game has a big flaw though. The level of variance from game to game is minimal.

I really wanted to like this. I wanted it to be the better version of Hyperborea, a game that I felt was fun but totally unbalanced. But this just ended up being okay. Not quite exiting enough. The 'events' didn't do it for me at all. The drawing mechanic, unless you leave things out turn after turn, aiming for one big turn (which the game discourages via events), ends up sort of feeling very chance based because you simply draw from your bag instead of cycle through it like you do in hyperborea. In the end, Hyperborea is definitely less balanced than this is. But it is also more fun.

Adjusted 3rd Edition rules with the fixed bathhouse 2 for 1 draw. And 3 promo buildings Tavern, Depot & Vineyard and nine new cardboard included building set No.1,2,3 and 4! Bought at the fair the 5th player addon together with little Notes for easy writing of the final result. Useful is also the Setupcard for 2,3,4 or 5 players. 
Very tactical bag draw game-mechanismn, which gives a player much options, to place your followers. Seems that the knights & the tradesman and 1 to 2 monks are the key tracks for a successful play. After my 3rd play the events seems to be a bit harmless, so i will try the Print & play modification: HARD TIMES. With these events the game should be more for the tougher players. 
Complete with big expansions Invasion and Trade & Intrigue.

Seems like this is the year of drawing things out of bags.  

Looks like an innocuous engine building game where spent resources go back in your bag to be drawn again.  Spend resources to get more resources or money or move around on the board or advance on the tracks.  Game ends after 18 rounds.  

myeh, but for some reason, I kind of like it.  Tagging it as a churn-and-burn game I might pick up at some point.

Juego de colocación de trabajadores con varias mecánicas curiosas. Cada jugador tiene su tablero donde están ubicadas las acciones y cada acción necesita colocar varios trabajadores de distinos colores para ser activada. Además, las acciones disponibles se pueden incrementar con losetas que se pueden adquirir. Lo novedoso es que los trabajadores de que dispones salen de una bolsa propia en cada turno, por lo que debes prepararte contra el azar. Es muy sencillo de explicar y jugar, y muy entretenido. Recomendable. :)

Another solid Euro as I work my way through the BGG-100. Nice mechanic with the workers going into the grab bag so you don't know which actions you'll be able to do each round.

My friend is a huge fan of this game, and we very, very rarely have differing opinions on games - until Orleans I'm fairly sure it was only Agricola and War of the Ring that we disagreed on. However, after playing Orleans with him I just don't see what he sees. I absolutely don't dislike the game; I thought it was engaging and enjoyable and I'll certainly play it again if anyone in the group asks. However, for me personally, Orleans didn't offer me anything more than I get out of playing most deckbuilders - just a much fiddlier set up. Not a bad game at all, just don't see what a lot of others must see in this one.

I thought this was a pretty good game.  Simple enough to be learned quickly, but with quite a lot of different ways to try to optimize your scoring.   It does seem a little limited in the ways to score points (either houses+research or goods), but maybe there's more than initially meets the eye.

Best "deckbuilder" I own. Turns are quick and engaging, and although much of the game feels like "multiplayer solitaire" (which I tend to like anyway), competition over the citizens can get fierce. The variety of buildings make each game feel different, and I really like how you can choose a specialization with the workers you get, which also adds variety. At some point you do have to diversify and/or cull pieces, so the Town Hall/Rathaus board and extra scoring/income opportunities they provide is a nice addition (though I wish the Rathaus board was better scaled for two players). I have not yet played with the expansion(s).

RATING: 8
A great game for people who like games of the cube pushing/resource management variety with a dose of "deck-building" thrown in.

You've got a bag of workers, and each turn, you pull some of them from the bag and allocate them to different tasks. Most tasks will move you up a track, making you better at something, while also adding another worker associated with that action to your bag. Your goal of course is to get a good bag of workers that give you high odds of pulling off your chosen strategy. Points are scored in a multitude of ways, so you have to choose which way is most efficient for you.

While nothing in the game is complicated, there's a lot of it to absorb, so a really nice game in the medium-heavy euro vein.

Excellent bag-building game, where you assign workers to various tasks in order to do various actions. Different ways to score points, although a mix is advisable. Very enjoyable.

One of this year's pouch-building games (the theme of the show, I am told), Orleans was a surprising disappointment. I hadn't read the rules beforehand, but had heard positive buzz. The game itself was much lighter than I would prefer, and mostly involved spending actions to collect points in a rather straightforward way. The engine-building consisted almost exclusively of getting more actions, so that you can collect more points per round. One of the other players felt there were no meaningful decisions in the game. While that's a little farther than I would go, I didn't think the game gave me any reason to feel invested in my decisions. 

The game's thematic trappings actually hindered my enjoyment further. The game contains a number of different currencies, each of which is just a value of points. For example, there is money that you can't spend (each dollar is one point). There are goods that you collect but don't use or consume (a wheat is one point, a cheese is two, etc.). They might as well have used a single currency - VP - and just printed a value on every token. It would have at least saved me the burden of having to check the reference board all the time in order to figure out whether wine or yarn is more valuable.

It's not terrible, but I'd be okay never playing this again. There are too many better games out there.

RATING: 8
Very interesting "bag-builder" in which players select actions from various chits pulled out of their bag. The theme is a bit dry but the mechanisms are a lot of fun with each type of worker providing unique benefits. The game looks great with the colorful bags and thick cardboard and is fairly easy to learn. Highly recommended if you can get past its dry Euro appearance.

Based on 1 play with 2 players:

I LOVE the pacing of this game. I love that the rulebook calls out the steps that players can theoretically do simultaneously, and can just call for turn order if it's going to matter. Our group has a habit of finding these steps in games and doing things this way anyway, but serious props for actually calling it out and making it official. Even for us, I think it helped us just jump in right away and get to it.

I like this game more as a Euro than as a deckbuilder. The deckbuilding just feels like a nice way to add some variety and keep you on your toes, rather than being an interesting aspect unto itself here. Largely because the game requires diversity, whereas in most deckbuilders the goal is to create a refined group of specific synergies. In this it seems like at most you want to grab everyone you can, it's just a matter of when and how to do it efficiently (where you maybe prune out one follower type). 

So while it's not exactly what I look for in a deckbuilder, I do think it folds into the Euro formula nicely. Adding "luck of the draw" to a Euro may make the game sound a little reactionary, and it is. There's ways to mitigate your luck of course, but you're not going to be totally screwed if you fly by the seat of your pants. I kind of enjoy that. It gives the game a relaxed feel.

Only tried at 2p so far, and I can see where 3-4p might be more interesting and send you down different paths more often, but honestly I thought the game was good enough at 2p that while I'd happily try it with more, I'm not really champing at the bit to get it to the group.

Also, as with all games that have a static setup I do worry about replayability - specifically that there might be an optimal route with the place tiles. There's an optional rule that suggests letting players draft some out before play, though I think it might be more interesting to remove a few at random instead. Will experiment.

(MASTERPIECE #4 of 10) Enough cannot be said about Orleans and is currently hitting the table more and more often. I really like how forgiving the game is. There are times where I will not focus on the games travel/building mechanism until late in the game and still pull off a victory. Very balanced game play allows for players to continually deploy various strategies. Haven't really explored all of the games other expansion modules so I imagine my score still has room to go up.

RATING: 7
A solitaire-ish, puzzle-y game in the new-school euro style. But I felt it was simple enough and streamlined enough that I quite enjoyed it. I liked it more than many other games of its type. 

I thought the timing and competition on the shared boards are enough to inject some variability and adaptability (and some pleasant viciousness) into the game. 

I like that the game allows you to set up your actions independently, relying on the honor system to make sure no one is spying on other people's boards for advantage. The quick playing and low downtime nature of the game (while still maintaining some interaction)is one of its biggest draws. 

Also, I love that when you get resources, you don't do anything with them. There is no ridiculous conversion engine you have to deal with. Just points. Refreshing.

This game is very, very good! I had heard a lot of my friends praise this game, so my expectations were high – and yet they were fulfilled! So far I have only tried it a couple of times, both with 4 players, and I would love to try it with 2 and 3 as well. This is a bag building eurogame with a boring theme (not that I mind) and a few ways to score points - I honestly wouldn’t call it a point salad game as some people do as you only score points for money and goods and buildings at the end of the game… There aren’t a whole lot of different actions, but due to the plethora of buildings you can try different strategies each time (although there are only a few ways to score points, there are still a handful of different strategies).

Of course there is luck – you draw chits randomly from a bag, and I have witnessed several bad draws, but generally it didn’t seem to be that critical, although it sucks so much when you just don’t get the guy you need... What was critical, however, was how you could lose an early guy to a plague at random… This gave the players who didn’t get hurt a huge advantage as you basically wasted your entire first turn when you claimed the guy in the first place! That is an unnecessary dose of luck that I don’t like. Also, unlike other deck and bag building games, you might not be able to cycle through you “deck”, so you might not ever see a particular chit, which can hurt you a lot… Sure, you can send some chits away so that you “clean” your bag a bit and cycle through your bag faster, but I’m still not sure I like this.

What I did like was the ease of learning and small amount of interaction - although to be fair there is probably more than I give credit for. Because you really need to watch out where the other players are going on the map so you don’t get stuck as building guildhalls is a huge source of points! It also matters a lot when sending your workers away to the common board as you can get a great reward if your timing is right (in both of my plays I actually timed it great as I could close one of the areas and therefore claim the citizen token, but I just didn’t draw the token I needed and had several of…)

I am very impressed with this game and think that it’s a great, light/medium weight euro! If only it wasn’t so expensive I would probably buy it, and I might end up doing so anyway as I think my wife will enjoy it a lot as you’re mostly minding your own business, although you do need to watch out for the different tracks and where the other players build guildhalls. I highly recommend this game!

A little bummed because I want to like it more. The game works and is good but I feel like the games are repetitive with strategy. There needs to be something more beside the event tiles to change gameplay. Most games I am able to accomplish too much, reaching the end of most tracks. It's still a good game with great ideas, I enjoy drawing out of the bag and building up, I'm hoping the Invasion expansion adds something more to the base.

Great game. You build a bag of workers and the combination you pull on your turn determines what actions you can take. They game is very free in how you utilize your workers as you could take no actions and solely set up for the next turn with a bad draw, but then you have a great turn coming. It is neat that used workers always go back into the bag so it's not like you can cycle your bag and get that wild worker, you just need to get lucky on the pull or manage your actions so you leave less guys in the bag. There is so much to do and not enough time, and with 18 game rounds, you definitely have the space to see your strategy in action. There is a nice blend of tactics (responding to other players in the various races that are going on) and strategy (what actions get upgraded with technology and what extra action spaces you build) that give this game a lot of perceived depth. Love it and hope to own it soon.

My first try with bag building and I enjoyed it. 18 rounds sounds like a lot, but they go quick because you have limited choices each turn based on what you draw out of your bag. Even though there are a lot of options you are constrained by what your bag gives you. I could definitely see this rating going up if different strategies work over repeated plays.

The game looks beautiful and I look forward to trying it again soon. Now to find a way to make setup and tear down a little easier as there are a lot of pieces!

Boatman seems to be useless comparing to other characters.  The position of boatmen can be replaced with monk.  The path to achieve high VP seems to be restricted to monotonic strategy.  Getting the scholars to push the scriptorium track in the first half of the game and travelling to get goods tokens in the remaining.  Some buildings are too strong and caused some in-balance situation.  Can the function of boatmen be strengthen by getting the money every new round?  However, it may weaken the function of farmer.

I love the multiple paths to victory, the beautiful colors,   the lovely components (even without the deluxe version), and the overall simplicity of your turn - draw workers, place workers for actions on your board, and take actions in turn order. Boom. It's strategic as well as tactical. And most of all, it's just fun.

Not by any stretch of the imagination a terrible game, but one that's not really for me, I'm afraid. Bag-building games are essentially deckbuilders where the deck is shuffled every round, and while it's better than a lot of the drecky post-Dominion deckbuilders (looking your way Star Realms and Ascension), I miss the frisson of discovery that comes along with a new and unexpected combination of cards. Mechanically, there are some aspects that remind me of De Vulgari Eloquentia and Village but I end up missing those games' quirky emergent narratives. And the whole package reminds me of another low-theme Euro puzzler set in Ye Olden Days France, Troyes, but even Troyes has more player interaction than this one; apart from some mildly interesting timing races and a tiny dash of area control in the race to place guild halls on the map, this one has nada.

Long story short, yet another game that can't escape the shadow of other better games for me.

** WARNING: SERIOUS GAME-NERD BUZZWORD BUKKAKE AHEAD**

Obviously, lots of people disagree with me on this point. Some people can't get enough of this style of attractive-looking ultra-low conflict games (even I am occasionally charmed by them) but to me the games that really end up standing out from the crowd are the ones that are playgrounds for emergent behavior and unexpected synergies. My distinct impression of Orleans is that the whole system lies on the surface level and none of the subsystems (which are impeccably well-designed) actually interact in a way that causes you to be surprised and delighted in the night. Despite a plethora of point sources (many commodities plus the inevitable cardboard deniers AND IT IS ALWAYS DENIERS), all of the things you get for doing the things you do in the game are just, in the end, points. The game rewards the person who finds the most efficient path to vacuuming up points in exactly the way the designers envisioned it. If that's fun for you, great. It doesn't spark joy for me.

Probably my favorite mechanic of any game, which ensures that no two games are exactly alike. Multiple ways to collect VP is great; however it is not as extensive as Five Tribes which causes Orleans to fall just a shade behind Five Tribes. But otherwise brilliant game. Orleans does provide a shorter game and somewhat of a relief from the possible over-analysis problems in Five Tribes

RATING: 7
Rating is tentative and I am hoping more play will improve it. Aesthetics, mechanics, theme: all lovely. The uncertainty derived from the bag draw feels novel and creates good tension. So while I am still allowed to devise and pursue strategies, there is definitely tactical maneuvering and readjustment that arises in game play as well.

The downside so far is it ends up feeling hollow on the back end. There is not much of a sense of satisfaction of having built things since it constantly brings the focus explicitly back to victory points. This game would rate higher if it would allow for construction and travel and trade to be an ends in themselves and serve some purpose other than victory points. Save the VPs for scoring after game play is done.

This one is quickly becoming one of my favorites. The race to the end is such a nail biting experience. You are constantly trying to beat the game clock and with about 5 rounds left are thinking there's no way I can get everything done I need done! Somehow you manage to eek every possible point from you building and knowledge track. Absolutely a must have for any gamers collection. Takes worker placement and gives it a personality.

I really love the mechanics and the design but after a few games the best available strategy seems very clear and dominant. Variation in form of round tiles and goods placed on the travel map doesn't really matter so that the replayability drops a lot in my oppinion. First rating was a 9, further downgrading possible.

EDIT 31.05.2015 
Having played it more, I feel I have been a bit harsh in my rating, probably due to the high expectations I had for this game. It is indeed a fine game, rich with theme and novel mechanisms, intertwined quite well. I am getting used to the spacial element of the game, now it does not feel foreign to the design. Still, I feel the game could have been better:

- there is too much luck in the bag pulling mechanism, as is, which given the scope and duration of the game feels out of place. I would prefer to play it dominion-style, where you have to go through all your followers before you refill the bag

- the place tiles seem too few to start with, and a couple of them are still quite strong, almost too strong (school, laboratory and windmill) especially in combos with each other or by placing technology tiles on them

- the events seem unnecessary and uninspired. Should have been removed from the game

- there seems to be a dominant strategy, that if not stopped will win the game. It involves working towards completing the development track, and halfway through the game switching towards building houses, all while collecting as much money as possible as a secondary objective.

- the boatman track seems less useful than the rest

Overall, a very good game that deserves its nomination for KedJ 2015. Upped the rating from 6 to 7.

-----

Engine building euro, with a bag building mechanism. Although the main concept is appealing, the game felt underdeveloped and rushed in many ways:

- the council sub-game devolves into a game of chicken, where you go to thin your deck and even get paid for it
- the money seems underutilized as a currency, used mainly as VP and sometimes for taxes
- the spatial subgame, although perhaps thematic, feels disjointed from the engine building nature of the game
- the goods are just diffent VPs, nothing more
- several buildings seem terribly strong, others completely underwhelming (1 joker-monk for 2 VPs??)

There are even more nitpicks, but i will stop here. The other main problem is that turn order at times is crucial to the action that you want to take due to resource scarcity, but there is hardly anything you can do to influence it. Even worse, pulling the wrong chits out of the bag can mean the difference between a super round and a mediocre one. And unlike dominion and the like, the chits go back in the bag after you use them, so you cannot guarantee seeing your full "deck" in every rotation. Unless you thin to death, that is, which is mindnumbingly boring..

Overall, there is a solid game engine in the core of Orleans, and the art is fantastic, but the game was not polished enough and this shows. A missed opportunity.

I'm as shocked as anyone that this one's here. Most folks know of my intense dislike of dice and/or randomness for the sake of randomness. So a worker placement game with different types of workers (ala Manhattan Project) that revolves entirely around drawing workers randomly from a bag didn't seem quite up my alley. I was very wrong. There's a lot of engine building and such early on that isn't affected by the random worker draws. Once you're set-up, the randomness adds a very tactical element where you must make decisions on the fly based on what you draw. It's brilliant, I love it.

Worker placement, bag management, with a hint of area control thrown into the mix.

A close second behind Viticulture for my current favourite game.  A relatively recent purchase, but after a few plays I fell in love with it.

Looking at the game board can be a little daunting for new players, but it's quite simple mechanically, and doesn't take long to run through how each action works on a players board.

Great at higher player counts, simply so you don't have to remove any (or as many) tokens!  Other than that, a great experience every time.

Copying comment from Deluxe edition, because it's the exact same game.

Tough one to rate. I like the general idea, but it feels like the development of it was cut a bit short. I have been trying to tweak it, but it always requires buy-in from the group, and is a bit tedious. It doesn't feel like there's much of an ark, or opportunity for clever moves. But folks have generally liked it.

Not an altogether bad game, as I suspected from the Spiel preview when the game came out for the first time.The bag building captures the essence of deck building and especially deck thinning rather well: at some point you'll have more people in your bag than you can use effectively, so you'll have to work out some appropriate response to getting the whole in balance again.

That said, the game this idea is embedded in is bone dry and quite repetitive; and the artwork on the player boards not sufficiently contrast-rich compared to the tokens which will populate it. I was moderately enjoying myself upon playing it, but was also done with the whole after the game was finished. There isn't much to do save efficiently placing worker discs, for the rewards obtained don't really open up new vistas of the game's design. More bite wouldn't have been amiss.

After 2 plays we are convinced that the bathhouse is broken. We are modding it to a level 2 building, and I'll revisit this rating once I've had a chance to test.

Edit: After playing with the revised bathhouse, the game now feels balanced and I can enjoy it. Definitely worth a try. The engine building is good, there is a lot of subtlety to the strategies and a decent amount of replayability. Definitely a keeper.

Very fun bag building game. This game is fairly easy to learn how to play despite having lots of components everywhere, and my wife really likes playing this one with me. 

I would like to note that we play with a house rule whenever we play this game: Instead of being able to take any building you want, we reveal 4 buildings from the level one and level two stack each and those are the buildings available to purchase. After a building is purchased, you put another one out from the deck. People tend to do the same old strategies again and again if given free reign of the buildings, and we felt this additional rule forced us to change things up with every game. This rule is also very beginner friendly, as those with analysis paralysis problems tend to look at each and every tile before finally just picking one.

It does look busy but this is just Bruges plus in weight. 3.0 on a five point scale is accurate. It plays slightly longer than Bruges. I enjoyed this midweight game. Cara won 128 to 109. My church to avoid events seemed mildly beneficial and Cara's bathhouse seemed wildly beneficial so that helped her. Also she did collect a lot of goods using the point to point movement option. I did promote a few more people to the "special deeds to work on" board, but overall it was not enough. I believe I collected too many monks (which are wild tokens in this game). It feels like Augustus mashed up with a Feld game, but it is a Civ/general board game/modern Bruges style board game. It fills a similar niche and we can never have too many of these kinds as right now the main ones that spring to mind are just 3 titles: Bruges, Rococo, and Orleans. All of these have been recently made. All are squarely medium in weight, can fairly easily get played, and feel like "main event" games which are really "nice" and slickly modern compared to the more generic and popular titles of the same weight (some of which help to fill BGG's top 200 list). All of them compare well with heavier weight titles that don't get pulled out as much.

Still. I wish Siberia played with two better. I liked it too but I don't think it really works too well with two players. Orleans, of course, works fine with two.

Start out with Augustus and Bruges. Then play Orleans maybe. It might make it make more sense.

Cara wins our 2nd round. I don't demand anything more than this to be fully satisfied. That is a real nice game there.

I'm surprised by the high ratings for this game. Fairly straightforward point-building exercise where a lot of the trappings are unnecessary. You get money, but it's never really used to buy stuff -- it's really mostly just points. Five commodities: but little thematic point to them -- one is 5 points, another 4, another 3, 2, 1. Most of the decisions made are not interesting or exciting. Even the (lovely) deluxe edition I have is bizarre in that all the wooden commodities would be a hassle to randomize and put on the board, so they stay in baggies. Overall, a "nice" game but not one I feel compelled to keep playing. So many better games.

Played this a couple of times with 4 very experienced gamers - the first time we were learning the mechanisms and game flow and despite some misgivings we tried again. Sadly we didn't even finish as it was such a painful experience. Negative chits early on made the game tough and then those who were unlucky with chit draws suffered badly. After a long discussion and analysis we decided this was too fiddly a game with little variation in play styles available. Not sure how this got into production - there are so many much cleaner and better designed games out there (even some I don't like) but this one I won't play again and can see little merit in the design..

Deck-building meets worker placement. Well, it's more "drawing pool in the bag"-building than deck-building, really. With a deck of cards you cycle through the deck, or you choose the cards you want to use during a turn. In Orléans you have to draw the "cards" from a bag, and trust your luck. Theoretically it's also possible that a "card" you've put in the bag never gets drawn. The workers are used to gain more workers (drawing pool in the bag-building) or perform an action (moving on the central game board and build houses). The type of worker you gain also has an immediate impact (gain money or goods, advance on the literacy track...). Nice game, but some of the tiles give too big an advantage to the owner. Furthermore, as far as thematic depth is concerned, we are in very shallow waters here. The game does not give you the feeling you are in medieval France.

Wow. This game blew me away. At the heart of it, it is not a very complex game. You send your worker out to different locations to gain new workers and new abilities, including technology tiles that make it easier to complete tasks, drawing more tiles per round, free resources, or buildings that allow you to do special actions that your opponents cannot. You also want to travel around the board to build trading posts or draw more tiles. However, this is a deeply strategic game with numerous paths to victory. Highly enjoyable and replayable.

I have avoided playing this game just based on the theme and art alone. When I finally did play this game, it wasn't so bad. It's a cross between worker placement and deck building in that you pull workers from a bag each round and then place them. That means you need to be thinking about thinning out workers that are no longer needed and make sure you can cycle through those remaining quick enough. From there it's a basic worker placement, resource gathering euro with a random event every round.

Gets high marks for being the first (or second) of its kind and for being fun to play, but some oddities about the game suggest that it underwent quite a transformation during development, leaving tonsils-like vestiges of earlier versions. For one thing, two items (grain and money) have the same value; only one needs to be in the game. For another, the rules devote a good chunk of space to penalties that are unlikely ever to be imposed. Also, playing on the Beneficial Deeds board never seems to be an optimal play, at least in a two-player game. Maybe this will all make sense when the expansions come.

Lots of fun. Orleans plays much different from what I expected after reading the rules. Every turn is a nice little puzzle based on the pieces you draw, the special actions you manage to aquire and the strategy you try to pursue.

:star: Not so hard to teach. This is a rather straight forward game that should be easy to teach to people that have played a deck builder before.
:star: The events spice things up a little. In the game I played, the tax events appeared rather late and so the hoarding of resources was expensive. This might be another thing to keep in mind in the next game.
:star: I`m not so sure if there are really multiple routes to victory or if this is more of a race where everyone is aiming for the same things and you`re just trying to get the best scoring tiles first. Either way, currently I'm okay with it either way.
:star: Our first game was quite long. It might be that we're slow players, but we weren't even close to 90 minutes.

Is bag building a genre now?  Orelans is a great worker placement game that has replaced the usual "blocking" mechanic with more of a worker shortage; as a result the game never feels as "take-that" as a more traditional worker placement can, but still lets you bring a lot of pressure to bear on your opponents.  Multiple strategies with specialization, just the right amount of randomness; great game.

simply the best euro bag builder.  the handel & intrige expansion really enhances the game. only con is the little round pieces will get worn out after many plays from pulling them out of the bag all the time.

RATING: 5.5
Clever but dull - the hook is that it is a bag builder rather than a deck-builder, but there is a bit more luck as the bag doesn't cycle it is just seeded with a random draw every turn. Some engine building, by pushing cubes up some tracks, and the usual action v VP return efficiency calculation rinsed and repeated by every Euro there has ever been.

Would play again but hope I don't have to.

I was told this was a game where you handle your of bag of shit and thought this I must play. Turned out it was chits instead but the game is still great.

I really like how everything fits together, you can't win all tracks so you have your classical engine building but this is coupled with a bag of personas where you normally won't draw all of them and will have to use them as efficient as possible or perhaps save some of them for next round.

Reasonable playing time too.

Rating could go up.  Enjoyed it quite a bit building up the bag with various tiles to draw out.  Rating could go down if replayability is limited or if certain tiles clearly outclass the rest.

Actually dropping a point (to 7) as one particular strategy seemed very strong.

An amazing rich worker placement game with a twist. The bag builder mechanic is great and the various options and paths to victory are interesting and satisfying. I'm a bit worried that it will not have a great amount of replayability after you play the game several times. A real winner in my opinion

Wonderful bag builder, themed on the Loire Valley in medieval times.  Players draw workers from a bag, and place them on their personal action board.  Actions that are completed can be activated, which advances players in the game, and grants more workers of specific types.  Any actions triggered, and workers earned, return those workers to the bag.  Effectively this is a deck building game in bag form.  Lovely pruning mechanic sending workers off to the town hall.

Initially busy game, but surprisingly fast and fluid to play.  Really liked it.  Much better than Hyperborea.

Orleans. This game is flat out fun. Fine, fine, it's just collecting stuff and pushing cubes up your spread sheet, (what does cheese mean = cheese equals two points) but how it comes together is both clever and fun. There is also a map, I tend to have a soft spot for games which feature a map that is just one part of the game as it is here. The game is really simple, but at the same time there's some depth in the interlocking gears.  It reminds me of Goa in that sense, but with no auctions, and is more simple, simple enough to perhaps be a gateway plus perhaps.

The multiple ways of getting points, reminds me of five tribes (other point salads also but mostly five tribes), as does the way that the game starts so open with so many options, later the options are still there but most are not sensible. I feel like there is an analogy with life there...

Plays excellently with two. Is quite solitaire, but you have options to block people of optimal moves and parasite off their actions - but only on that shared board whatever that is called, which is my least favourite part of the game anyway as it feels a bit tacked on. There's a bit of a scramble to get monks also, which I find amusing in its athematic vibe. 

However, what makes this game for me, is that I haven't to date enjoyed a deck builder enough to keep it, mostly because I find repeatedly shuffling the cards fiddly and a bit boring, here you get all round that with the bag mechanic, which for me works so much better.

I think the artwork and overall aesthetic is gorgeous, that's the non-deluxe version straight out of the box.

 Recommended.

Played this game at BGGcon 2015. Really liked the spins on the worker placement mechanics. Each space takes several workers to activate and you will then in turn get more workers and advance on several different tracks to gain VP and so forth. 

In particular I like the "gear" mechanic which allows you to "mechanize" worker spaces so they become active on every turn. You can create powerful combinations this way and rack up the points. 

Light on theme, but I did enjoy the consistent medieval art style.

The coop scenario in the Invasion expansion is the best way to play this game. The events are fun and the scenario is challenging but fair and always comes down to the wire.

a terrific mid-weight Euro in the true sense of a Euro.  The celebrated mechanic is “bag-building” which is similar to deck building but with a twist.  You collect character tokens which allow you to do actions, but you draw a limited number of these out of the bag each turn so you never really know what actions will be available to you each turn.  Then the aim is to manage the bag you are building so as to maximise the chance of being able to do the actions you want which allow you to optimise the strategy you are following.  Plenty of strategies to follow and the game plays smoothly.

This really is a crisp and dry Euro with a lot to think about.  This, along with Castles of Mad King Ludwig and Golden Ages are definitely my favourite Euros to come from Essen 2014.

The push pull of taking actions that increase your scoring potential, but not necessarily needing the worker that comes with them is pretty intriguing.  I've only played it two player though and aside from the above mentioned, the game is kind of boring as the game is pretty wide open and you can do pretty much anything you want.  If something you want gets taken, there are always other good options, so there's not much tension either.  It's probably better with more players though.  Love the art on this one.

A fantastic Euro through and through. The bag building mechanic is fun and feels fresh (even though I know its just a re-hashing of deck building).

2015-01-16 : Engine builder game with multiple avenues to victory. The fact that it's 18 rounds counters the slight randomness almost completely. Score could go up on subsequent plays.
2015-01-24 : Another game showed the main weakness of this game : you do the same actions over and over again and it gets boring fast. There's nothing wrong with the game and the graphics and layout are excellent, but this is not one that invites multiple plays. When you've played it, you've played it.

RATING: 6
Take at least some of my comments with a grain of salt. Why? I have never actually played a normal game of Orleans. I've only played some of the scenarios from the Invasion expansion. This is a bag building game where you add tokens to a bag and draw them out. It's like a deckbuilder, but you are using a bag and tokens instead of cards. Also, deckbuilding is only a potion of what's going on in the game rather than the entire game. As far as my opinion, the underpinnings of this game are really solid when you consider the various competitive scenarios, solo scenarios, expansion modules, expanded place locations, and even a coop scenario. While the system itself is very flexible, the setup is extremely annoying. Depending on the number of players, you have to adjust many factors (number of tokens, goods, etc.) The randomization of the goods and placing them on the map is annoying. Especially, when you consider that it's easy to miss a spot or accidentally filling in a spot for 3/4 players when playing with less. The game itself has a a few other issues that I dislike: The goods/money *mainly* serve the same function, which is being worth a specific amount of VP at the end of the game. In addition, the events become kind of boring and trivial. These last two points can be alleviated via the Trade & Intrigue expansion and the new trade beneficial deeds board is supposed to be much better. In the end, this is a good game and I can see it's appeal, but it's also not one I'm jonesing to keep in my collection.

Good combination of worker placement with workers with varied powers. It feels fresh. I have hopes that the addition of new buildings can affect the game play in a meaningful manner.

I've played it several times and have found you can do well with different strategies. 

There are some issues with it. The original bathhouse was probably to broken powerful. It seems like you pretty much have to build a craftsman on the first turn. The sailors seem fairly under powered and underwhelming.

RATING: 9
A beautiful union of two great mechanics. I love that players are not simply influenced by which characters they want or need in their bag, but also by the associated bonus attributed with acquiring said workers. Not only that, but as in most deck builders more workers isn't always better, and players must balance character acquisition (and associated bonuses) with acquiring victory points. The game ramps up very nicely, and I always leave the game feeling satisfied. My main qualm is the severe lack of variability. The game is wide open, and players can pursue any strategy they want in any given game, but the game does not encourage adaptive play in the slightest. Unless house-ruled players can rinse-and-repeat strategies too easily.

Huge disappointment. I played the game 2 players and was told that with 4 players it gets better but seriously a 2-4 player game should be playable at 2p.
-Events where but a nuisance could be ignored completely.
-The resources are like different denominations of coins 1,2,3,4,5 but nothing else.
-2p there's no competition anywhere everyone is doing the same in different order.
- So it's pick the expensive products that you can get and build houses while travelling and that's it. Seems that there are not meaningful decisions or they are so evident that everybody would pick the obvious.

Rating based on one 3 player game.  Worker placement done well.  Seems properly balanced, has several paths to win, no run away leader issues, quality game pieces and design.  Pretty much everything you want in this type of game.  Might be perhaps a tad long, and setup takes a bit but thats typical of this type of game.  Learning curve isn't too bad, most gamers should figure it out after a few turns.  I'd recommend.

There are interesting aspects to this game.  However, there were several things that bugged me:

(1) The brinksmanship involved in sending workers to the good works board

(2) The fact that it seems like a "look at your own player board" game except that it really isn't, so you have to wait to see what others will do before you can move

(3) The game can really slow down to a crawl if people try to play well

[b]The bag-building sounds interesting on the surface, but by the end of my second play, this revealed itself to me as a salad roll - rice-paper thin theme with a helping of point-salad. Runs too long for what it is.

Wife's opinion: Loved first play. At end of her second play, she felt it was already getting samey.

Rating history: 8|6|4[/b]

[b]After 3 plays...[/b] ORLEANS ended up being a bit of a disappointment. The first play was fun enough (I tend to be a sucker for novelty), but half-way through my second play, I felt like I was essentially doing the same thing all over again. I get that there is a sandbox element to the game, and I need to try new things, but I don't find the different ways to pursue points to be that interesting (I usually find this a problem with point-salad games).

Maybe it's the 2p game that does work as well for me, but the more I think about it, the more I think that it's the gameplay itself. I like analyzing the map and racing for the high-quality points, but Broom Service does that better as a main part of gameplay, and nothing else in Orleans really grabs me.

However, this would have easily been close to the top of my best new game of 2016 had we played it a day earlier.  
The artwork is amazing - I love the medieval style.  Game play is extremely simple and we easily worked out how to play during our first play.  I'm sure there are multiple paths to victory and there is certainly depth to strategy so I'm hoping this one will see plenty of table time.

TMG did a fantastic job of reprinting this game. All components are thick and sturdy. And the velvety bags are beautiful. No insert though, but my usual plastic container solution does the trick. As far as gameplay, I love it. Very smooth, turns go quick, so many directions you can go in. The obvious travel strategy seems a little overpowered. But with more plays, I want to experiment the money strategy. On my most recent play, I actually won by a narrow margin because of money, despite being behind in everything else. My only complaint--besides what I just mentioned--would be the 18 events. Some are rewarding, but those that cause you to pay (e.g. goods, money, etc.) seem too easy. My wife and I always had ample money or goods to pay when required. And losing a character to a plague was never a huge loss as we can generally just get the same one back on the next turn. Otherwise, excellent game!

Első ránézésre iszonyat bonyodalmasnak tűnik, de a szabályokat meghallgatva nem is annyira az. Tetszik benne, hogy összetett, de ha olyan hangulatban vagy, akkor azért nem kötelező szétagyalni magadat, simán lehet megérzésből is játszani. Rögtön feltűnt, hogy a mechanikák nagyon hasonlítanak a Siberiához, ami nem véletlen, mert a szerző ugyanaz. Ez gyakorlatilag egy gémeresített Siberia. 
Két dolog viszont nem annyira tetszett: 
1. Míg a Siberiában átjött a tematika ezzel a mechanikával, addig itt nem igazán. 
2. Szerintem nagyon ki van balanszolva minden a játékban, viszont a ehhez képest az események túl sok véletlen hoznak be. Persze egy játék után ezt nehéz megítélne, de félek, hogy az nyer, akinek jobban illeszkedik a stratégiájához az események sorozata.

I like the idea behind Orléans. The way bag-building is used here reasonably simplifies its deck-building roots and still allows for meaningful differences to develop between players. At least in theory.

In practice, the game doesn't quite succeed. it is too limited in strategical scope. For example, soldiers and machines are must-haves for anyone early on. Only after they have been exhausted can players actually start to meaningfully move away from the pack. It's a pity that the game cannot quite meet its ambitious goals because it feels really promising.

The only other detractors are mostly incidental: The rulebook is so full of holes and ambiguous rules it's not funny, and the chits start showing wear pretty quickly which is a little unfortunate. Maybe cubes or meeples would have been a better choice for the grab bag content.

RATING: 6
The game is fine but is way too overrated on BGG.

Pretty standard Euro with bland/empty theme and much room for mechanical improvement (ie player interaction and interchange in value of goods collected/market).... being outdone already by many other games such as on kickstarter.  This is also a case where I think having open information kills a bit of the fun; you know what everyone is planning to do, but there is not a ton you can do to change others' decisions, and you cannot do much to change your own planned actions either.

Nevertheless, bag-building is fun, and there is this unique layer of strategy trying to get your tiles to match-up and building your bag appropriately.  Game also gets more tense towards the end.

Verkapptes Deckbauspiel, indem Plättchen im Stoffbeutel die Karten ersetzen. ORLÉANS pielt sich straight und ohne Mangel. Meine Entjungferungspartie hat mich enttäuscht. Die zweite Partie hinterliess in mir dann ein Gefühl von Faszination und Abneigung gleichermassen. Faszination: Die einfache Grundidee, die vielen Möglichkeiten, das Artwork. Abneigung: die Spieldauer, das Unausgereifte, das Uferlose. ORLÉANS ist der ideale Humus für Grübler. Ohne Upgrade Kit würde ich ORLÉANS nicht mehr spielen wollen, die Haptik der Holzfiguren hebt das Spiel spürbar in die Höhe und zeigt einmal mehr, dass Materialbewusstsein das Gesamtkunstwerk macht.

It has elements reminiscent of Dominion with chips drafted from a bag instead of cards and it has elements of building your abilities and moving around on a board that remind me of Lancaster. 

It's a pretty cool mix of euro elements; I am excited to give it some more attention.

The farmer track, development track, and the goods strewn across the shared guild-house map still do not amount for much competition with only 2-players. While the problem could be resolved with scaling, player interaction is otherwise so limited that bogging the game down with 3+ players is simply not worthwhile.

Glad I got to try this! The primary mechanism of building a bag of workers, buying those workers to move along effect tracks, and then pulling those workers blindly to activate spaces worked quite well together and make for an intriguing game. Easy to understand and play but not too easy to do everything you want. You have to respond repeatedly to bad luck, either from the events or from the worker pull. I typically like those sorts of games. I'm a little concerned about the replayability, as I did find activate my personal board actions quite dry and I can't imagine feeling inspired by doing it again (and it is what basically drives the game) but I was thinking about what I could have done differently for a next game, so that's a good sign! So, a very nice game that I enjoyed quite a bit, but not one I feel like is a signature game and that I would want immediately in my collection. But I would definitely play it again!

Absolutely love this. Very thinky and hurts your brain. My only issues with Orleans originally were the static set up with all buildings available, along with the events which seemed under powered. I now play with the official events variant and also a suggested BGG buildings variant where the buildings are rotated every turn. This makes the game much more interesting and limits same buildings strategies being used. Also getting the upgrade kit significantly increased the level of satisfaction I get from the game, that it now sits in my top 2 games

I have mixed feelings on this game. It's clearly got a fresh design with a mechanic you might call action building, which I would describe as a hybrid version of action selection, set collecting, and deck building. In that regard the game works, and is interesting. You try to puzzle out what tokens you have for the round vs which actions you most want to take, and whether you'll settle for something inefficient in terms of actions, but effective at scoring points. In addition, you can build up your engine in different ways, and that has a wonderful feel to it.

However, on the down side, it feels under-developed. Interaction is low, except for a furious race to build the best buildings, which feel poorly balanced. The engine burns out before the game is over, so you're stuck playing somewhere between a few, and a half dozen turns on auto-pilot. Actions get eliminated as you progress, and you can reach the end of tracks as well. The scoring is exceptionally bland, with goods and money being simply VPs, with virtually no reason to distinguish between them. It leaves you wondering why this aspect wasn't developed further, as there could have easily been a meaningful layer there that was left behind for no good reason. After a few buildings are built, it feels more and more solitaire, and less and less like you're making difficult decisions. Kind of a let down in that regard.

Not a bad game by any stretch, and I prefer this to Hyperborea, which was a more ambitious, but IMO less successful design using this new and novel mechanic. I get why people are fawning over this design, but I think it will either need to be tweaked with many house rules or will not hold up to repeated plays. We'll see as I'm interested enough to give it another go or two.

Update - increased rating after a 5p game. Seems to play well at 5. Not sure it's as well balanced for less than that.

Update 2 - game is growing on me. Up to about 6 plays now. Some of the balance issues I was concerned about early had more to do with how players were playing the game.

Enjoyable 'bag-building' game.  Hews to its theme quite well, you can build plans and strategies, but at the end of the day you have to go with what you pull out of the bag.  There are a number of different paths - usually it seems you specialise in one while trying to score as much as possible in others - I like it.

It's a pure bag builder, by which I mean that it doesn't use a discard pile to emulate a deck builder and instead uses the fact that it doesn't need one. I'm of two minds about this: I don't like that you never cycle your bag, meaning that there's always a chance to never draw a specific character you went out of your way to buy. I do like the simplicity and that it further incentivizes you to thin out your bag.

The game itself is simple euro goodness. There's many different ways to get points and specialize your engine and there's some slight competition for the limited resources. The turns are fast and the game has a nice flow to it.

I don't like the vague secret but simultaneous and non-hidden placement, but that's easily house ruled.

Really enjoying this game now that we are finally (most of?) the rules right. Great game, lots of tension, the wooden bits are wonderfully tactile. The rules are unfortunately unclear in way too many places, especially due to the combination of changed tiles between versions, and the fact that the rulebook wasn't updated to take into account that a fifth player option was added.

Opinion: really good twist on deck pool building, although it is not original (at least for me, as I have tried Hyperborea first), but it makes the mechanic really well.
Draw your workers and start making them work on your buildings, decide when to activate the buildings and run for the good positions on the map, but do not forget what is happening in the central board.
Found it fast, and with almost no waiting between turns. Draw, place and activate... do you really need many time to think?

Had to wait this long to find a fully translated edition. after playing Stuarts half translated one he brought back from Essen last year I hope this edition holds up quality wise and the chips don't show signs of wear after only a few games- time will tell I suppose. Feels like this might be one of the last games we buy for a while but happy with collection now as everything is a little different and feel we need to play what we have more...I'm sure gen con and Essen (mainly Essen) next year might make be reconsider that thought though!

Excellent bag building game that flows very smoothly and has a perfect duration. The choices are very interesting, the iconography is helpful and it uses the particularities ov bag building versus deckbuilding well as you can leave some workers on the board (incomplete payments or market) and the ones from the actions always go back to the bag. 
The side board with the achievements is a really interesting way to cull your supply of workers.
Note: Played it with a lot of component upgrades and promos, have yet to see the base game.

Fun worker placement game with a twist: there are different types of worker and to perform each action you need to allocate the correct workers to the action space. The snag is that you draw your workers randomly from a bag, so there's no guarantee you'll get the workers you need. It's all about adapting your plan to the best option each turn, plus planning ahead by acquiring the right workers, or the Monks which can serve as a wild worker. I like this game a lot.

I don't like point hoarding game, they are very boring and repetitive. Especially if there is nothing else to do like in this game. The points means feels like just numbers in a bank account, I don't get any pride or joy or agricola-like feeling of getting those points. I don't even know why the money is in that game... I think it should be removed and just be more points (yay more points), not to mention the production and shipping price a tiny bit.. With taxes, you lose points. That would reduce the amount of components and accelerate as well as simplify it a little. Point hoarding is so uncreative. 

Everything in the game feels bland unlike agricola which is gratifying to build and buy things. In this game, everything is just points. Buidling stuff only gets you more points, if you do another thing it makes you more points, etc. For me, the game sucks.

Not because I think the game sucks that there is nothing good in it. The token building mechanic is good, and would have been excellent in a game when what you do meant more than just making victory points.

The travelling map is somewhat interesting... but again it's just some point hoarding. If the map would have been some trading area where you built caravans to create production chains that would give you money which would allow you to improve your company, trade routes or Orléans itself, that would have made the map more interesting.

I don't see the point of having that sideboard with the buildings, they do nothing, give no bonus or special ability, it should simply be removed from the game. It's just another crappy point hoarding thing... or when you build one of them, all players gets a certain benefit or the game generates more goods, or players receives an additionnal specific worker, etc.

There are plenty of things that this game should have been, but point hoarding ONLY is one of the worse it could be.

I strongly believe that there are several elements in this game that should be removed since I don't see their use and they absolutely bring nothing more to the game (like the sideboard with the buildings or the coins). This game feels very unidimensional and it is quite superficial (in the sense of no depth).

If I take another point based game like "Agricola" you have a feeling of building something, of surviving, or buying and trading... in Orléans, there is really no feeling that you are playing a trader at all, it feels more like you are gatering bread crumps and whomever has the most wins... boring. In "The Village", you have that feeling that time is running out and that having a plan B if someone ruins your plan A or that you are putting sticks into the wheels of your opponents by activating the market first, etc. You don't have any of those feelings in Orléans.

Orléans is a game that could have been much more and for me it fell quite short of its potential. It is a very tasteless, feelingless game for me.

I think the game has not been playtested enough, but especially with lots of different kind of players.

Each turn, you draw a certain amount of workers (tokens) from a bag, and have to combine and place them on your personal player board in order to trigger actions -move your pawn on the common board to pick up resources (=VP), build a trading house (=VP), add new workers to your bag (+ evolve on a track that offers either an extra action, more tokens each turn, money, etc…).

RATING: 9
I always enjoy playing Orleans because of how it combines resource management with worker placement with its unique bag-building mechanism. I love the challenge of managing not only which workers my bag is composed of, but the round-to-round balancing act between what's in the bag and what's on the action board. 

It's also a great next-step game to teach to new players. When set up it can look very challenging and complicated, but every group I've ever taught it to has been able to grasp very quickly how the game works and it's fun to watch new players' eyes light up as they begin to see the various paths they can explore in the game.

Very mixed feelings about this.  The 'build your own worker pool' idea is interesting whereas the entire scoring mechanism is not (collect *everything*).  Furthermore the flow and ebb of the game seems to be pretty much predictable. Get buildings and workers early, travel, build & send lateron.  Plus I'm not sure if the builidings or building combos are really balanced.

The game uses a "worker-pool building" system in which the players acquire worker tokens and draw them from a bag to allocate to various action spaces on their personal boards. Each action requires a specific set of workers, and that is what drives the game. Unfortunately, the actions are uninteresting and boring.

This is one of those bloated designs that give you lots of choices to give an impression of depth. There are many tracks for your cubes to advance, a dozen or more unique buildings to choose from, various goods that are simply different point values, a map where your figure moves around via roads and rivers to pick up those goods and to build houses, and so on. There are even events (the trademark of a designer who doesn't know when to stop) that are completely... uneventful. Also, the balance seems a little off, especially with some buildings.

To be fair, mechanically the game works. But it's ultimately an unengaging and dry exercise in engine building that is not helped by the unappealing artwork.

It's not point-mongering, which is nice--you need to make a conscious decision to change from infrastructure to scoring. I found it to be fine, but the bag-building didn't strike me as enough to differentiate it from the hordes of comparable eurogames. This one also has front-loaded decisions and questionable balance (both in the form of the buildings), so there's that.
It's strange--Hyperborean bag-building grabs me, but this one doesn't.

Another good game from "dlp games" (the best to me), but this time it leans more towards strategy gamers than familys.

The game isn't perfect, though:
1) the scriptorium seems very weak
2) the buildings vary pretty much in terms of balancing
3) the tiles are very thin (still good quality!) and thus, not easy to pick up and somewhat hard to see when placed on your sheet
5) the technology tiles are very strong and I don't see any player winning the game without taking atleast one of them within the first few rounds
6) there isn't much interaction
7) it takes ages to prepare...


However, the game is still fun and seems to offer a good amount of different strategys. I rarely like multiplayer-solitaire stuff, but this is one of the few that I really enjoy nontheless.

If it had a bit more player interaction and more balanced buildings, this would have been a 10, which I really rarely pull out.

Played at Salt Con.  The teacher and one other player made the exact same moves for about the first 6 turns, until they finally pulled a different set of action tokens.  The path they used seemed clearly superior at first blush (heavy on automation tokens and the wild workers).  I eventually caught up to the teacher but not the other guy, as the second half of the game kind of negates the engine-building in the first half by becoming a map movement efficiency puzzle.  So it turned out that my less-efficient engine didn't really matter.  This should be a good thing as I initially worried the game was too scripted, but I was annoyed by the length of the game and the shift in focus made the length far worse.  Overall, some standard Euro-pleasure in decision making and short-medium turn planning, but an overly long, unsatisfying game experience in toto.

Although i dislike euros, i can apreciate what this game does. Blending card-building & worker placement.. into bag-building.. really cool & very elegant at that.

If you play for the first time take note of the event deck, because it only punishes the produce product strategy.. actually i could've lived without the event deck.. the deaths are cool.. but none of the other events add anything interesting & just take time.

Only played as Co-op game with the Invasion expansion.
Good euro co-op game that really requires a lot of discussion. However, player interaction is pretty small. It's mostly limited to staying out of each others way and working towards the same objective (eg. collecting money). Replayability is pretty low. You'll mostly be doing the exact same thing in each game. You can't focus on a specific thing and build an engine around that because you are forced to diversify in order to complete the goals.

As with most deck building games the trick is a small but reliable deck, lots of monks help but you're best off trimming out the excess stuff in the town hall

An optimizer's dream. I wish the game had more intriguing mechanics but the main optimization engine is very enjoyable. Don't play with those prone to lots of AP

EDIT: Not as enamored with it as I was in my first play, but I still enjoy it. It's definitely much better with more since there is more competition

(12/25/2015) Comment based on three plays.

This is an interesting medieval-themeed game centered around a unique action-token pull mechanism. Each player's tableau has a number of action spaces that are triggered only when two or three specific combinations of action-tokens are assigned to them. In a matter of speaking, this is a deck building game, where tokens are used instead of cards, and the deck is reshuffled with both new and old cards at the end of every turn.

There are seven types of tokens representing the various characters of Orleans: monks, farmers, craftsmen, merchants, sailors, soldiers, and scholars. Starting with only four tokens, players assign them to action spaces that beget new tokens, advancement on progress tracks, gold, buildings, and/or automation. The new tokens and tokens used to trigger the action are thrown back into a bag, where a new set of tokens are drawn for the next turn. The token pull mechanism is similar to the one in [thing=35285][/thing], where turn order is determined by the pull. In Orleans, turn order is clockwise, but the actions you can take will be determined by what tokens are pulled and how you assign them.

There is a lot of tension and frustration as players pull and assign tokens, because a bad pull can result in fewer or no actions. As more tokens are generated and thrown into the bad, pulling specific combinations of characters to trigger specific actions becomes increasingly difficult. Generating solider tokens also allows a player to pull progressively more tokens, starting from four all the way to eight tokens. Also, monks can be powerful as they act as wild cards for most action spaces. Lastly, tokens can be permanently reassigned off the player tableau for bonuses, similar to "thinning the deck", so to speak. Because of the token pull, there is a substantial element of luck, but given the above mentioned choices, this can be somewhat mitigated. Thus, players must be flexible and adaptable to the ever changing results of the token pull; there is no single clear path to victory.

Instead, there seems to be many, many paths to victory, like the many branches of a tree. At first glance, this feels like a Feld "point salad", where almost every action results in some generation of VP in terms of gold or progress in some track, but it becomes clear with a few plays that there are some key strategies. However, with the varying order of event tiles, and random distribution of goods on the travel board, newer strategies will probably evolve with more plays.

The kickstarter edition that replaces the cardboard chits with wooden, stickered tokens is gorgeous and tactile-wise very satisfying. The artwork is detailed, but not distracting. Play is quick, with very little downtime, even with the full complement of four players. Mechanics-wise, it is easy to start playing. Still, the game has a somewhat higher learning curve to play well. The game is not very forgiving, where a small misstep early on will be magnified into unsatisfying play and poor scores. It is all about maximizing the Euro-efficiency of one's engine, but in terms of maximizing the probabilities. I think it is an intriguing deck builder that "fools" you into thinking it is something novel with the use of token pulls. Still, I'm not exactly excited to play a friend's copy any further, as beyond the token pulls, it is a multi-variate pissing contest. Not sure I care much for that, but then again, I didn't care much for the Feldian point salad at first. Time will tell if this design grows on me. Initial rating is a "7".

Virker veldig spennende. Har ikke terninger, men bruker isteden "events" og "bag building" med dine egne "workers" som den variable spillmekanismen. Definitivt et "Engine-building" spill!!! Både eget og to felles spillebrett. Et av de felles spillebrettene er todelt med et landskap hvor man beveger seg rundt og henter resurser og bygge "hus", samt en del hvor man henter nye "workers" og resurser. På det andre felles spillebrettet bygger man selve byen Orleans. Man kan også bygge bygninger (egne "mini spillebrett") som man også kan gjøre handlinger på - på samme måte som på de personlige spillebrettene. Veldig mye som skjer :-)
Har også en utvidelse (Orléans: Invasion) med 3 nye varianter av spillet, hvor de grunnleggende spillemekanismene består, men noen av spillebrettene byttes ut. En av variantene er spesielt interessant siden den gjør spillet om til et "co-op game" som er helt unikt.

A bag-building game. Each round you draw your allotted amount of tokens out of the bag and place them on your board to do actions. Most actions require 2-3 particular colored tokens to activate, but there are gears you can acquire which permanently makes the affected action need one less token (you cover the token you want to ignore with the gear) and there are some additional actions (buildings) you can add to your board that might only use 1 token.

For the first half of the game, timing is rarely an issue so very often, we execute all actions one player at a time (in turn order). This helps to speed the game up. When it does matter (generally near the end of the game when resources are running out or multiple people are sending tokens to the town hall), then we do the one-action-per-player-at-a-time as per the rules.

Pouch-building! I liked this better than the other pouch-building game that I'd played. It's fairly abstract and bare-bones. At first the number of rounds to be played seems like a LOT, but it moves really quickly once all players figure out what they're doing. I like the way that you can send some tokens to score, but then you lose the use of them. Clever all-around. (1 play)

RATING: 7.5
Neutral - on occasion

The bag-building and action planning are much more fun than I thought. It captures the excitement of deck-building games: building bag/deck and projecting the final scoring, and the rest of game is typical Euro: maximize the efficiency for what is drawn from the bag.

I suspect if, after more plays, the game will become more and more scripted just somewhat like [thing=36218][/thing]. The minor complaint is that scoring is just plain and not that satisfying, but at least works. Also, note that it probably has more luck factor than it appears, I even suspect the luck is at same level as [thing=180680][thing]

After more plays, I lower the rating a little due to its being mechanical, abstract and puzzle-like, which may scare some.

Mid/heavy medieval-themed bag-builder. Quite a few moving pieces, but still fairly easy to teach. High level of indirect player interaction through limited resources, buildings and workers. Excellent production values all round; well punched, double-thick cardboard pieces, thematically illustrated.

It has the same feeling of escalation as Le Havre, but gives you a lot more options per turn, and never gets boring.

I only traded it away because I managed to get my hands on the Deluxe edition.

Orleans--a good game. Lots of interesting decisions. The bag building design is fun. Very good production value by Tasty Minstrel Games. It is neat how there are multiple paths to victory.

Interesting implementation of the bag-building mechanics. With all the mitigation possible luck feels almost non-existing and long term strategy usually pays out.
Player attrition is limited, but present (mainly felt on the map). Personally I would prefer if the end-of-turn events would impact more on the game itself, as I feel their impact is marginal to the whole ensemble.

An intriguing design...

Still, it didn't charm me to play it on regular basis plus I see 2 significant problems:
- replayability - the best buildings can be identified quickly and good players will always choose from them ignoring the rest.  And the game will always witness the same strategies.
- long playing time - 18 rounds, it's A LOT.  The game seems playable with max. 3 players.

Bokkensprong Sinaai 17/2/2017. De startspeler draait een gebeurtenistegel om die aan het einde van de ronde zal worden uitgevoerd, en wie eerst en laatst op het boerenspoor staat, krijgt een punt meer resp. minder. Dan trekt elke speler zijn maximaal aantal personages (wit boer, zwart handelaar, geel monnik, grijs professor, rood ridder, bruin ambachtsman) uit zijn trekzak en plaatst die op zijn actiebord (iedereen terzelfder tijd), waarna elke speler om beurt een actie mag uitvoeren tot niemand er nog heeft. Elke gewenste actie vergt een specifieke combinatie van personages (vb. rood, wit en blauw). Acties laten toe meer personages te krijgen, grondstoffen (=punten) te bekomen, extra actievelden te krijgen, vooruit te gaan op het kennisspoor, personages weg te schenken in ruil voor geld of kennis, te reizen over land of water op de landkaart, huizen te bouwen in bezochte dorpjes of in Orléans zelf, etc. Hier en daar vallen burgers te verdienen, die worden bijgeteld bij het aantal huizen en daarna worden vermenigvuldigd met het aantal sterren op het kennisspoor (=punten). Wanneer een actie wordt uitgevoerd, worden de personagefiches terug in de trekzak gestopt. Ten slotte wordt de gebeurtenis uitgevoerd (soms vb. extra inkomsten, soms vb. belastingen). Goederen en geld leveren nog punten op aan het eind.
Strategisch spel met redelijke geluksfactor door het willekeurig trekken van personagefiches uit de zak. Het eerste spel heeft wel veel te lang geduurd doordat iedereen te lang nadacht bij het plaatsen van personagefiches (3u...).

I liked this one a lot, sort of like Concordia in that it's a family-weight game but it's also interesting enough for people used to more complex games. The core of the game is solid, you're collecting tokens that represent different people, and the actions you can take on your turn require specific combinations of people. The bag-building mechanic is pretty similar to deck-building, but the way this one works you're more just looking to balance the ratios of your tokens so you have a variety of good options than you are hoping to get particular combos of cards like in most deck-builders. This plus the fact that there are wild guys makes me feel more in control than in a typical deck-builder. But the really genius thing is how most of the tokens also come with a bonus like unlocking a new actions spot just for you, making other actions easier to activate later, or just points. Balancing getting the right ratios of different guys in your bag while also collecting the bonuses you want is the central conflict you have to deal with. And there's a really cool system for culling your bag while getting some nice benefits, so you do have a lot of control of what's in your bag.

I was under the initial impression that this was a deeper strategy game that it turned out to be.  I was a bit shocked when I discovered just how simple the mechanics actually were.  There is certainly strategy and even some tactics involved for sure, probably enough for your average gamer.  However, I really enjoy deeper games and this game isn't ideal for me. That's NOT to say this is a bad game or even an average game, it's certainly well designed and it seem quite balanced. I can appreciate the blend of simple mechanics, mitigated luck, and the decent amount of planning need to play well. I'll certainly play this game but I'll probably delegate it to the family gaming pile.

RATING: 7
Orléans is a combination of worker placement and pool building (in this case, building a bag of tokens). It has plenty of Euro-style goodness with multiple paths to winning and a heavy emphasis on players racing each other to achieve or claim certain positions. 

There are some aspects of the game that detract from the expeirence. The pool building is a bit funky, with it being less of an engine-building affair than other such games. Luck of the draw can be mitigated, but sometimes it shows up even when kept at bay. And while I'm glad the game does have at least some player interaction, it is a shame that requires slowing the game down to have players perform actions one-at-a-time even when the chance for interaction is minimal.

That said, it's still an enjoyable Euro for fans of the two core mechanics.

RATING: 8
So there’s barely any theme and the game has some fiddly bits. You know what? In Orléans these things don’t bring it down. They don’t lift it up either, but that’s not necessary since the underlying game is more than solid. Assign your workers, build your bag, and improve your engine. It all feeds into itself which makes successfully managing all these parts and making them synergise into a point-scoring machine feels really rewarding. Even if you don’t quite pull that off, you can certainly look back at the end of a game and see that you’ve built something nice, even if it wasn’t quite enough to land you a win.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (December 2015)

I’m a bit disappointed. Orleans is a good game and I enjoy it, but due to the hype, I was expecting something more. Still, I want to play it again and it has a permanent spot in my game collection, but I thought Orleans was going to surpass Hyperborea for me, and it didn’t. 

The game components are very good. The art is also good, but its style isn’t for me. The theme is boring (to me) but I don’t mind because it is a good Euro game.

I love deck builder games, but the constant shuffling is a hassle, I also like dice building games but they have too much uncontrollable luck, so the perfect solution for me are the bag building games. I was expecting to enjoy Orleans more than I enjoyed Hyperborea but that wasn’t the case. I’m not sure which game came first so I’m not sure which game came up with the bag building innovation, but I hope more bag building games pop up soon. I will buy them all.

The rules aren’t complex. You can explain them under 20 minutes and the gameplay is around 2 hours. When you read that the game takes 18 turns you feel the game is very long, but the turns flow quickly and at the end you wish you had a couple more turns to accomplish more.

The mechanism are very similar to Hyperborea´s. You draw tiles form your bag and when the actions are completed they can be activated, the main difference is that when you do an action all the tiles return to the bag immediately. I’m not sure I like this as you are never assured to see all the tiles you acquired, it increases the luck factor and decreases the strategic factor (you can draw the same tile you already used before drawing some tiles you never used). To control this you can always leave some titles unused in your market but it feels fishy to me.

The game features lots of interesting decisions, namely which tiles to acquire (characters and buildings) but each decision is meaningful and has far reaching consequences. With each character you are tweaking the possibilities and capabilities of your “deck”. I LOVE this. With each building you are acquiring new abilities only you can use.

Some of the events have a very powerful effect. I dislike the one that makes you to lose one of your tiles because it is a random tile. You can really be screwed by this and the mitigation elements aren’t that many.

It seems the game has many paths to victory, but I feel the development track is a must if one wants to win, I’m not sure I like this, but you don’t need to be the leader on the development track, you need only to advance it to a good level so I’m ok with it. On the other hand it seems some of the actions/buildings are better than others, that is, I’m not sure about the balance of these actions/buildings. I need to play more times to see if this bothers me or not.

Bottom line, I need to play it again soon and I think I will buy all its expansions. As I said before, I was expecting a better game, but Orleans is a good game anyway and it has chances to get an improved rating from me. Hyperborea is a better game IMO. The gameflow is surprisingly quick.

After more plays, I continue to like Orleans. I like it so much that I will buy all its expansions. However, I feel the buildings are unbalanced. There are some buildings that are very powerful and others that are clearly inferior. I’m worried because this seems to imply there are better paths to victory than others.

Also the random events can be devastating at the beginning of the game, but from midgame onward they seem (almost) meaningless.

Between editions, the developers changed how a building works (Bathouse), however in the rulebook and on the tile itself, they left open the possibility of playing it in any way players want. I’m very bothered when publisher change a core rule between editions so I wanted to congratulate DLP games for doing it “right”. Leaving both options open is, definitely, the way to go :thumbsup:.

I hate when the second or third edition of a game change core rules. I have found Stonemaier Games (Viticulture, Euphoria) and Level99 Games (Pixel Tactics, War of Indines) to be particularly fond of this practice, and that has made me very wary of their games.

With more plays, I realize Orleans is a tremendous game, it plays fast even with 18 turns and the decisions aren’t obvious. It is perhaps better than Hyperborea, but I do enjoy both games. 

I will play with the Invasion expansion soon!

I love Orleans and I always want to play it. Due to this I’m upgrading its rating.

I finally played the Orleans: Invasion expansion and the cooperative scenario makes the game very interesting to me.

Easy decisions at first, but as the game goes on each player must make some very serious choices.  The game play a little long, but it still comes in under 3 hours.  Simultaneous action selection might speed the game, but other players selections might affect your decisions, especially in the later game when workers and resources are limited.

Not a lightweight, but not as heavy a game as I initially thought.

As discovered after one play, high VP commodities and the development track appear to be one road to victory, but concentrating on education and goods might do OK, too.

Needs more play...

First off, this game had a Feld-level of thematic wrapper (i.e. None). It's pretty much just point salad in a box.

Gameplaywise, it's got a lovely central mechanic which revolves around bag building. I love how you can see numerous strategic possibilities: the way that getting additional "workers" for your bag gives you a benefit at the time of collection - as well as an ongoing one - meaning you can easily clog up you bag just to get that initial benefit; The Townhall which allows you to thin out your bag AND score at the same time; The map which - being a great way to score VP - gets pretty contested and tense; the new Buildings which give you an ever growing action pool; the pretty simple resource system (in fact resource - coins, etc - are basically just VP).

However...

The pace of the game seemed a tad flat. You kind of just go through the motions for X rounds. I feel a big part of this are the event cards which should form the backbone for any arc but just seem really diluted. They just don't seem to have much of an impact on the game (at least based on my initial plays).

Overall, good but not great.  Will need to play some more...

One 4-player game, and it was very fun! I think this one will be sticking around for a while.

I love the bag building aspect, but the way goods are used is rather boring (they are just points really). I hope the expansion will make it more interesting! 

The Invasion scenario is really great. Definitely bumps this up a bit.

RATING: 9.9
"Orleans" is one of my absolute favorite games of all time. The worker placement part is very intuitive and the "bag building" part feels pretty unique to me.
Down time is very low for a strategic game since the planning phase for each turn is done simlutanously and the actions can be done very quickly.
There is not a lot of player interaction, but racing to occupy specific spaces, buy unique building cards and reach goals for rewards on the public boards is enough interaction for me in a strategic game like this. In these aspects lie quite a few different strategies.
I always find it hillarious to pull the workers from the bag and getting rewarded for taking risks (or punished and try to make the best out of it).
This game got even better with particular modules from the expansions, adding variety to the random events occuring each turn and the public board ("Trade & Intrigue") as well as a very solid coop-mode and 2 solo scenarios ("Invasion"),
The game works for me with all player counts from 1-4 (even though the number of solo-scenarios is very limited) and I can teach the complete game to experienced players in about 15-20 minutes.
The game is not thematic, which doesn't bother me personally in this case because the mechanics are interesting enough to me. Only the set up tends to be a little bit annoying since there is a lot of different modules  and stuff to count and put in order for the different player counts and modes.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
For me this is a typical 'designer' game. Very fun and enjoyable to play a couple of times, but also a game that I quickly burned out on because of unilateral strategy. This game is a race in efficiency. Efficiency that sometimes gets frustrated by the luck of the draw, even with good risk-management. I think I can best describe this game as playing Dominion with the same set of cards (plus a few additions) over and over again. There are a couple of strategies but these are explored pretty fast. Then the only thing that remains with repeated plays is trying to optimize these strategies. But for me the game is not good enough to warrant these repeated plays. A few downsides I encountered: the balance of the bathhouse, very fast wear on tokens and an unsatisfying feeling about picking actions simultaneously to speed up game play when sometimes picking actions is dependent on persons before you. But picking actions in turn order will really slow down the game to the point of boredom.

The "collect tile system" in a bag is interesting, but too many elements in this game are nonsense.

We gave a new opportunity to this game, and we found it better, but I still do not think it is an outstanding game. I find that the randomness is too high in key moments, and the turn order is bleak, it can ruin a good strategy. Uprated to 7 from 6.

RATING: 8
Rating based on about a dozen plays, the first few with the original game that had component wear issues; since then, I have played almost exclusively with the TMG edition that offers superior components.  Very smooth gameplay due to the fact the much of the game is simultaneous, but players need to slow down if turn order is significant, as it is when things run out.  Only learning curve is knowing what the buildings due.  Tough to do well, you need to watch what your opponents are doing, be aware of the endgame scoring, plus have a good memory of what is in your bag, what may be surplus and timing issues when trying to earn Citizens and beat opponents to a city site in a crowded 4-5 P game.  Obviously there's alot of luck (a la Dominion) in getting the draws at the right time, but it's a fun and challenging game.  Wonder if it will see the expansions that RGG did with Dominion.  Right now, I'd have to rate it higher than Dominion because of the interaction with the map board as well as multiplicity of scoring options.

This game is way better than Altiplano.
The game is so much better also with Orléans: Trade & Intrigue. Without 
Orléans: Trade & Intrigue its a solid 7. 

The major downside to this game is there is a chance of AP, people thinking too long for an action they might want to do. So first game might take 2-3 hours. 

There are quite a few ways to play the game and it changes from game to game. 
There is no obvious way to win. But at some-point you need to stop buying new followers and starting to get points.

Update after second play May 2015

A friend wanted to play this and I was willing to give it another shot. Not much changed for me. The bag building is a nice mechanic that hasn't been done to death and I think a lot of people are overlooking the shortcomings of this game for that reason. It *could* have been a great game. Unfortunately the tension and interaction just aren't up to snuff. 

Reading the rules you really get the impression that money will be tight and torture a real threat. But after two or three turns you have more money than you could ever possibly need. Torture is not a real threat. So sad!

--------------------------------------------
Update after playing Oct 2014

The number one problem with this game is lack of tension. I hardly cared what anyone was doing and my decisions were all straightforward. It doesn't help that the value of everything is so transparent, there is a 1VP good a 2VP good, ect... They're worth the same to everyone at all times but for some reason one's called wheat and the other cheese... go figure. This game needed some more development. 

--------------------------
Read rules Sept 2014

This game looks very promising! The central mechanic is a neat twist on some well established ideas. Each player has worker tokens which get drawn from their own bag each round. You can use them to perform actions, several of which will give you a new worker to put in your bag. You fight to collect resources and build trading posts on a shared map, and fight for once per game action spaces on a shared worker placement board. Each player also has a personal board for placing workers and can expand this board during the game.

The game also has a few punishing events for the players to deal with, costing them various resources. If you can't pay you select a form of torture. You know events a round in advance, so you see it coming, at least a little bit.

The game seems to be mostly resource management and action efficiency. It's hard to judge this one without playing but I'm optimistic. It's certainly a medium weight Euro.

The buzzword of Essen 2014 was ‘bag-building’ and Orléans was one of the representatives. Given this novelty factor, I was surprised to recognize many details from Stockhausen’s previous release Siberia in Orléans. Both games feature the core challenge to cope best with what you’ve drawn. Both are about building up an engine enhancing future actions. In Siberia, the framework was more limited and tiles where drawn from one joint bag. It was also quicker and lighter. Orléans aims for a more full-fledged experience and targets strategy gamers.

On first impression, the engine-building part dominates the bag-building. The bag just happens to fill up with new tiles. When given the choice between the immediate function of a chosen action and the future value of the tile collected, the function mostly will win out. It’s an imperative to build up additional actions first, by getting soldiers for additional draws or at least by getting cog wheels reducing the needed input for actions. From there on, we tried to do the best with the bag content. At game end, trading points are the most valuable VP supplier, probably making any strategy unfeasible which neglects them completely. I got all except a single one of the most valuable good and still lost by a clear margin.

Hopefully, there’s more to Orléans than variations on one core strategy. I kept thinking afterwards about better combinations but for now I have a few reservations. 18 mostly repetitive rounds also took a bit too long to entice immediate replays.

Sasquatch 2014 "Neutral". When going through the rules, it seemed like money was going to be really tight and not being able to pay for the events somewhat brutal, but in practice money was plentiful within a few rounds and there was almost no tension related to players getting to things before you did. It seems like this could turn into a pretty good game with a bit more development to add tension to the money and player choices. I liked the bag building aspect and being able to thin the bag by sending the characters off to do something productive.

A unique blend of bag building and worker placement mechanics, Orleans' overall gameplay feels incredibly smooth despite all of the actions present to you. Some buildings are definitely overpowered (such as the Tailor, with which one can easily produce the most valuable resource every turn by the mid to late game), but the optional step to take out some of the buildings at the setup could bring more variability to the strategy.

This is a very cool game. Lots of options but not too overwhelming. Plays fairly quickly considering it plays over 18 rounds.

A neat attempt at bag building showing the influence of Stockhausen's own Siberia. I am just not so much of a fan of the whole bag building concept so far. Generally good, but somewhat uninspired especially towards the end, when there isn't necessarily that much to do left.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Some cool tricks, but the bag building with putting the tokens back in the bag after use, and the fact that most actions are time sensitive, force you to play quickly, and therefore incentivises doing the actions you can do with what you draw (which is random), and not making decisions based on what the odds of certain tokens coming back are.

Two player too open, lacks player interaction. Event cards unbalanced as the game progresses. Clever concept let down by some glaring design flaws which almost seem to not have tested very well. 

Update after 4p play: Much improved over 2P yet still distinctly average overall. Certain decisions feel forced toward the end game as their are clear optimal moves, so the level of difficult and intriguing decisionmaking is sorely lacking. Feels like the game could be "solved" in a handful of plays. Still lacks meaningful player interaction and the scoring system is just stupid and feels like an afterthought. That said, it has a place as a lazy Sunday afternoon Euro if you really don't feel like thinking too hard, although setup and teardown is a chore. Still think this is the most overrated game in the BGG top 50.

RATING: N/A
During the medieval goings-on around Orléans, you must assemble a following of farmers, merchants, knights, monks, etc. to gain supremacy through trade, construction and science in medieval France.

In the city of Orléans and the area of the Loire, you can take trade trips to other cities to acquire coveted goods and build trading posts. You need followers and their abilities to expand your dominance by putting them to work as traders, builders, and scientists. Knights expand your scope of action and secure your mercantile expeditions. Craftsmen build trading stations and tools to facilitate work. Scholars make progress in science, and last but not least it cannot hurt to get active in monasteries since with monks on your side you are much less likely to fall prey to fate.

In Orléans, you will always want to take more actions than possible, and there are many paths to victory. The challenge is to combine all elements as best as possible with regard to your strategy.

RATING: 7.3
This Kennerspiel des Jahres nominee is Reiner Stockhausen's 'bag building game', reusing some of his ideas of Siberia, still trying to make something novel. Well... I must say to me it did not feel like I was doing anything novel; this bag building (collecting workers in different colors for the worker placement phase where you can use them for different actions) felt just like dice pool building in Quarriors (or even Roll for the Galaxy for that matter) with the workers allowing less creativity than dice. Also it felt to me some game elements (e.g. buildings) were not fine-tuned; some of them felt strangely off the balance (yes, I say it only after one play but I played with some gamers who had played it quite a few times before and they agreed).
But that's all about complaints; otherwise it's a well-crafted complex Euro (well, rather JASEish but still), only nothing revolutionary. I even enjoyed my play of it, but would choose the above 4 complex Euros over it most of the time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.9
Asymmetric Euro with deck-building, worker-placement, and area movement mechanics. Tight, balanced, and fun.

My only complaint is that it somewhat lacks replay value, with the event tiles being (p. much) the only variable to play (apart from drafting buildings during the game, of which there is generally little competition). Would love to see an expansion with professions and a additional mechanics.

Quite overrated.  Despite what many are going to tell you, there are very few ways to play this game well (score > 200).  The multiple paths to victory is mostly an illusion and the balancing (of buildings, of disk types, etc.) is deceptively naive and uneven.  You really need the building expansions to create variety and even then, it's not that replayable.  The bag building mechanic was a nice/fresh idea, the production values are there, and at first glance the play feels nice, but it doesn't hold to scrutiny.

FIRST IMPRESSION: 

I enjoyed my play but I don't know it is one I need to own.  I wish the game was a bit more dynamic.  The lose a worker event can be painful and I'm not sure how I feel about it being somewhat random if someone loses a worker or not (yes, you can hedge your bets some).  Game is a pain to set up as well but gameplay is very streamlined and easy.  It initially feels like multiplayer solitaire but the final third of the game can start heating up with competition and getting in each other's way with travelling and "trashing" workers to try and gain the citizen multiplier buy placing the last worker.  

However, I may be tempted with the nice looking KS from Tasty Minstrel.

05/2016 Orléans is a delightful eurogame in which you are a French noble who is using his influece to let the people in and around Orléans to do his bidding. During the game you allocate the workers in your pool to different location to acquire new workers and gain certain abilities. These new workers along with your starting workers are all put into a bag and each round you draw from this bag a certain number of workers, never knowing which ones. The first rounds go by quick but as your pool grows and the amount of actions you can do per round increases the game gets more and more interesting.

The game is great and there are a lot of different and interesting strategies to explore from game to game. Set up however takes a long time and the basic game comes with so-so components. The people in the game are represented by cardboard chits which can be upgraded with wooden meeples if you buy a "fankit" from the Publisher.

Still, I enjoy every game I play of this and Orléans will be part of my collection for a long time.

11/2016 Orléans has the honor to get my first ever perfect 10 rating. It is a fantastic game that I could play anytime. With each and every play, I still discover new and interesting strategic avenues to persue. I just bought the first expansion and I can't wait to see what this adds to the gameplay.

Mi piace molto il meccanismo di Bag Building. In particolare in questo gioco di sviluppo.
Si pescano vari tipi di cittadini dal sacco, stando attenti a non restare ingolfati riempiendolo con il tipo sbagliato.
I cittadini pescati si dispogono per completare delle azioni al fine di incrementare lo sviluppo del proprio motore di gioco che porterà alla fine a fare punti.
Bello da vedere e da giocare. Un po' meno da apparecchiare, quanti tile!!! Sembra un Feld xD

I am honestly shocked this continues to rocket up the charts.

I found it incredibly dull, tedious, and unenjoyable. The bagbuilding idea is fun initially but there seemed to be no interesting decisions on what to actually do with the game itself.

Found it entirely too long. Tried to play a second game and quit. 

Would never play again.

A good gateway game, It has a lot of tried&true mechanics(deck building, worker placement, engine building) that you can teach for those who just started to get into boardgaming. I found some flaws (goods doesn't have function besides scoring victory points, certain buildings are a bit strong compared to others, and certain strategies doesn't work, like if you ignore the Development Track to do something else, you basically digging your own grave) but it's a great game.

Orleans can be best described as a bag builder: A bit like the mechanism in Yggdrasil, but much more directed like a traditional deck builder. You're pulling chits out of the bag, and placing them on your board to get actions and other chits. Eventually you'll be traveling around the map collecting resources and going up in different tracks.

Apart from the bag-building aspect, it's a nothing-special medium-weight euro. The bag-building aspect is what makes it most unique. However, even forgetting about the bag-building aspect, it does offer a variety of strategies to score points (which in our game were suspiciously well-balanced since we all ended within a point of each other).

One big word of warning: The starting chits were extremely worn on the last day of the con. So much so that I'd hate to be playing with them (almost hard to recognize the picture because so much of it had rubbed off). They clearly need to fix those production issues. Someone also recommended using some kind of clear spray that they use on wargaming chits.

We passed this over years ago, thinking it was just another point-grinder. How wrong we were. I love the combination of deck/bag building and worker placement.

RATING: 7.25
I would really like to give this game a better rating, but I can't. I am sorry. There are just too many little things that add up for me on the negative side, to let me give a ranking in the 8's or 9's like so many of you (plus known reviewers!) have. Let me sum up these negative thoughts real quick:

1. Too less player interaction. Yes, you can block other folks' houses on the mutual map, but choosing other paths is always an option and you most likely won't block anyone at all, not even in a four player game. Also in the first x turns it is completely unimportant what everyone else is doing, you can focus on your own strategy entirely and have no downside whatswhoever, guaranteed. Not until the last seven to eight rounds you will have to wait for the others to take their actions first to really profit from their decisions and executing better short term tactics. This is fine, but a little few for me. Hyperborea for instance does it better with direct player combat (e.g. killing other peoples characters), cards that let you destroy something from nearby players (e.g. VP or cubes) and cards that let you copy the abilities of other players cards. All of this is non-existent in Orleans, even if it would have been easy to implement (e.g. a tile for destroying other folks' buildings/tokens, a tile for copying the ability of another players tile etc.). 

2. Being first player becomes very important in the later states (especially considering the spots on your dying people) and so the game is not really balanced on who is becoming the first player in e.g. round 10, a point where being first in turn order can win you the game. So, some crazy person could calculate this ten rounds back and decide from that point on who sould be the first player on round 1, just to be in charge when it gets important, which is sad. There should have been another action on every playerboard(!) to become first player in the next round. Maybe just with 1 or 2 tokens to activate it, so that the penalty for the losing part of two players both choosing it in the same round is not too high. You get my general idea here.

3. Balance is still an issue. For instance Brown clearly is too strong in the beginning. I have never seen any player win, that did not go 2-3 times on Village and choosing brown tokens in the first 1-4 rounds.  The gearwheels are just to powerful in the beginning and allow for a much smoother and efficient engine than e.g. a fast priest (Yellow) stategy. I have seen people try fast priest (including myself) and it mostly failed miserably, aside from the fact that yellow tokens are considered to be the strongest out of all due to their diversity and would probably win in any other fair/balanced bag builder. In fact, a fast engine (many red knight tokens for drawing efficiency or as stated above fast brown for gearwheels) is much stronger and also less dependant on the sandglass happenings. Fast priest loses heavily on a Plague and/or Sacristy draw on turns 2-4, which directly leads to my next point.

4. The sandglass tiles. I know many people like tight games. The feeling of being thrown back and forth, slapped in the face and having to do certain things at a certain time at all costs just to stay in the running for first place. But I am not that kind of person. I like games where you can find your own stategies, where everything can lead to victory and every route is fairly balanced. Or where obstacles are very minor and more often than not "easy" to overcome. E.g. like in Caverna (food) or ZhanGuo (numbers). I also do enjoy games that are a little tighter from time to time, like with the food in Le Havre or the black crystals in AquaSphere, but if it get's out of hand and "too frequent", it irritates and upsets me a little to be honest. Orleans has these moments of pure annoyance, when there are two plagues or three taxes right at the start of the game, which simply bothers me. The drawing of the tiles is pure luck and the randomness of this fact (also, again: in a heavy strategy game) just boggles my mind. Why not fix them with printed numbers and a pre-selection process before the game. 1 Plague in the first third of the game, one in the second, one in the last - without knowing, when exactly. This would be equally fine, but a much smoother and more satisfying game experience. The game in it's current state is too much of a luckfest here and there so that certain matches can be real downers, believe me. And I am not a person that would ever leave a game mid-match or that insults the game every round, never. But Orleans was the first game ever that had me on the edge of that, really. Thank god I don't have to play evil Feld's like In The Year Of The Dragon I guess..

5. Also, considering penalties, the "white track" feels highly unnecessary in my opinion. Firstly, it can be a real pain in the ass (sorry for my bad mouth here) in the first turns and secondly does it encourage players to fill their bag with useless fodder of whites, just to get some more goods tiles and escape the penalty of last place on this track. This becomes rather tiring and should really NOT be part of a bag builder, where engine(!) is your most important thing. Keeping your bag thin and knowing what tokens/cubes you have is essential to pave the way for you and to follow a consistent strategy. Three more whites on turns 10-13 can really slow you down considerably imho and this simply would not have been necessary, if you would have removed the penalty (plus reward for 1st seat here!) in the first place. Really annoying.

6. Peoples tokens that are left in your bag in the end of the game should be worth VP also. It is just sad that everything that is left in your bag is senseless after the "graveyard"-board is full, close to full or simply not accessible for you anymore. Hyperborea does a better job here imho, giving you an incentive to collect tokens (here: cubes). I know you could argue for Orleans here that it could be part of your engine to keep your bag small and therefore fast, absolutely, but in the end this point is simply personal preference I guess.

7. Also, considering the bag: being able to look into your bag or put stuff out to recount what you currently have left and will be able to draw in the next turn is a childrens decision. Keeping track of your cubes/tokens yourself is an essential part of bag building entirely and a huge portion of fun for me personally in special. Here you can truly see who calculates from turn to turn and which player keeps track of his cubes/tokens and which doesn't. A simple houserule could fix this also, but rules or variants should be in the official rulebook in the first place and not be tasks for the players afterwards, at least in my opinion. This is not to say that the game is weakly written or that the rules are bad, by far not, but in my personal opinion a true bag builder should keep his engine hidden by default. As simple as that.

8. A really small one for last, if we're getting nitpicky anyway: if every colour has it's own track, why not Yellow? I know, yellow tokens are considered to be the best/strongest etc., but having a yellow track would just be consistent from a game design standpoint and not having it ultimately feels a but lackluster or unsatisfying to be honest. I want to show everybody how many Priests I have, darn it..! ;) Please make it happen in the next expansion. It does not have to feature a bonus for each step anyway, just the visual representation would be nice (and fair!). Thanks.. ;)

To end on a positive note though, here are some things that I really enjoy in Orleans and that keep it from the lows of 5's or 6s', ratingwise... :

A: The map size. It is forgiving and fair for all players, even in a four player game. Although it's a little too big for high player interaction, it leaves enough breathing room to reship an enemy, especially if you heavily dislike this kind of direct gameplay. Personally, I would love more interaction - as stated in "1." - but the current map size is fine for me too, for abovementioned reasons.

B: Being able to leave pieces on the market if you don't want to place them yet.

C: Being able to leave pieces on your board if you don't want to take the action yet  (as for instance having to perform a mandatory reset like in Hyperborea and putting everything away, back in your bag).

D: Being able to instantly put new tokens plus the used ones back in your bag after taking an action - this guarantees a more smooth flow of resources (tokens/cubes) than in most bag builders I know.

E: Being able to increase the size of your drawn tokens/cubes per turn. I really, really(!) like this feature (and to name it: Red Knights!!).

F: The main end game scoring with "(houses+dudes) x golden markers" is really elegant. I enjoy it quite a bit.

G: Killing people off to thin your bag and also get some gold/books/dudes on the way is great and a much better version of this mechanism than for instance in Village imho.

H: There is little to no downtime because of fairly fast gameplay and always interesting decisions. The last four to five rounds can be a bit tiring, sure, but I don't see this as a real issue though. It's fun and quick enough, and there are no real time-killing brain burner turns of sorts like e.g. in Five Tribes sometimes.

I will come back to this comment if I want to add anything later. Consider me to update this in the next 1-3 days haha.
Thanks for reading in any event. Have a nice day.

A bag building game where you start with some tokens and get more tokens that enable you to take more actions.  You add to a board to execute actions on the board and there is a scoring location in the center to eliminate old tokens that don't help you.  The game is a very interesting take on the "deck builder".  

I was not a big fan of the art, but I could see where others might like the medieval feel of it.  And the tokens did show a lot of wear after only a few plays.

Tra le azioni disponibili si possono aggiungere altri gettoni al sacchetto, estrarne un numero maggiore, costruire edifici che sbloccano bonus o azioni personali per tutta la partita ed altro.
L'interazione con gli altri giocatori è prevista in piccola parte mediante un tracciato parallelo sul quale con le apposite azioni ci si può muovere, costruire avamposti e raccogliere risorse (chi primo arriva meglio alloggia)

[b][thing=164928][/thing][/b] is one of 2014's crop of bag-builder games.  At it's heart, it's an worker placement game that uses chits and a bag in the same way a deck-builder uses a deck.  As workers are drawn at random from the player's bag, it's in the best interest of the player to hire workers that support his/her strategy.  And there's also a mechanism to retire workers to thin one's deck.  All in all, an interesting game that seems to have multiple strategies to explore.

Played once. I really like the bag-building mechanism and the game flows nicely.
There's a lot of possibilities that I like to explore further, although there are some worries about the balance of different buildings and strategies.
Update after three plays: I like it, but apparently more than anybody else around me. Balance is not an issue so far, I've seen scores around 160 with three different strategies. Lack of player interaction is an issue for some.

I really did not enjoy this game the first play. The second play I realized how to employ new strategies which were efficient in different ways than just loading up on gears. The random token draws can be annoying. I especially hated the rewards on the board where you sent your workers permanently....I place 9 workers, you place the 10th and get the bonus...bogus. I do like the "token thinning" aspect of that board, though.

I have not taught this game to a person who said that they did not like it after playing it.  The most common comment I get afterwards is that the game "plays smoothly".  Indeed it does.  The bag building concept is great.  I love that you don't cycle through you whole bag and you may never draw that one piece that you really need the whole game (which can be frustrating).  I upgraded the game with the wooden pieces from Board Game Bliss and have been very pleased at the quality.

This is a very interesting game with a lot of options. A LOT of options! There are many paths to gaining points but the game is still very straightforward and easy to understand.

So far best with 2. Game seems to drag on a bit too much in the end - most actions can be taken simultanious during the first many rounds of the game, but then the last 4-5 rounds, the game really slows down in a quite anti-climatic way. This is mostly seen with 4 players though. In 2-player games this is not a problem. 

Would have rated it higher, had it worked better in the end-game with 4 players.

By far the best worker placement game I have played.  So simple to learn and teach, so engrossing to play and master.  The bag draw mechanic is great and this is certain to become a modern classic.  Also worth the expenditure of replacing the cardboard discs with wooden components.

Very dry game where you are constantly looking at your own board. Kinda nerdish game. Not something I enjoy.

Having said that, the game is original and everything fits together well. Bag management is interesting. Turns are fast and action planning is done in parallel. 

The artwork doesn't doesn't blow me away but components are functional.

Not something I want to play very often, although I enjoyed this one play.

An absolutely brilliant game! The bag building mechanic works so smoothly and is eminently flexible, as evidenced by the abundance of modes that use it differently. It turns the deck building genre into something more, and the result is a game that's more puzzly and fun than a standard deck builder. There are dozens of paths to victory and the various buildings mix it up even further. One of the best mid-weight Euros I've ever played!

Don't know how I missed this one for as long as I did.  What an amazing game of pool building/worker placement!  The variety of building tiles adds a nice element of change between each game, but that is just icing on top of the cake.

Orleans gives players a wide array of objectives to shoot for and asks them to most efficiently, and craftily, complete them before the competition.

Unless some deckbuilders, it is easy in Orleans to thin out your "deck" in a way that makes your actions easier to predict, but also rewards you in a race with other players for more objectives.

Everything just clicks so well in Orleans that if you have not tried it, you honestly should.

RATING: 8
This game is an engine builder with hand management executed in a novel way.  The game appears overwhelming at first glance with all the different "worker" types and all the options you have, however, it is fairly easy to pick up.  This is especially true because the first few turns ramping turns with a smaller set of options.  This allows a new player to go through all the mechanics a couple times without establishing a game long strategy which is really helpful.

Rating based on 4 players.

A very pleasant game to play. It's a little low on player interaction for me, but the bingo-like matching of workers to perform actions is quite fun as you build your engine (though it's not quite an engine, as you never know which workers you'll draw), and while there's lots of things you can do it was not a point salad. I wish the chit-pull mechanism had more interesting things to do with the results... if the entire game was more like the map side with players jockeying for position I think I would like this game more. I think the game lasts a tad too long, but it was enjoyable.

Traded as I realize I don't really have opportunity to play this (as my own copy), and when I played it a second time it pretty much went down the same path as the first game.

Straighforward engine builder.

I found the first half of the game fantastic in that you you have a huge, interesting array of different strategies. I suspect you could play this game a hundred times, you could come up with 100 different ways of building your engine.

If the game has a flaw, it's that the second half can become a bit samey. Said another way, by this point you are simply applying your engine turn after turn rather than making any strategic decisions. While the beneficial deeds board does give some interest in the second half, it's all tactical, point salad decisions at this point, which while not terrible, isn't at the sublime level of the game's beginning.

Seems like we're unsuited for any kind of deck building or, in this case, bag building. Didn't like Dominion at all and Rokoko was quickly sold also. The buildings were rarely used in our plays, nobody felt particularly drawn to them. So we probably didn't grok the depth of the game entirely. We didn't feel too compelled to invest in any more plays though.

Sold Nov'17.

RATING: 6.8
This game has such potential.  On my first play, I would've rated it an 8.  With further plays, however, I've decided that the game isn't as polished as it could be.  Buildings and worker groups are imbalanced (even ignoring the entire Bath House history), and the game has scaling issues IMO.  There isn't as much variety as one would think since certain buildings are simply stronger than others.  There are incentives for things that don't need incentives, and a lack of incentives for strategies that could use them.  Additionally, the Events are practically meaningless except in the early game where they can feel devastating.  Money and goods are really just straight points without any interesting conversions, etc., and the map could be more interesting than it is IMO.  

Despite all of that, I'm keeping the game.  I like it... I just wish they had polished it up some more.  I'm curious to see if the new expansion will iron out some of the wrinkles...

Over-rated? I'll get flak for that. I think it's a euro in the worst possible way: there is a façade of different paths to victory, but they are obvious, front loaded and not equal is investment. The dev track is flat-out too powerful and dominates the strategic decisions, the rest is distraction chrome.

RATING: 10
Very fun bag building game. Always plenty of actions to take, but there's always more you still wish you could. Setup is a pain but there is little downtime during the game as everyone takes their turns at the same time usually. I could see dropping this down to a 9 after more playthroughs because i could see it getting a little repetitive. There's no slow-the-leader mechanism nor is there any way to get many points in a single turn so if someone has a clear lead mid way through the game it's hard to catch them. Still, the most fun game I've played to date.

I have some problems with Orleans:

1. The random events are a nuisance and add nothing interesting to the game. My two problems with them are:

- Some bad luck with an early harvest event could have you losing $4 more than other players (if you haven't yet obtained a wheat tile), and an early plague could have you losing a good chit while others get lucky and lose nothing.

- They steer you away from a travel-based strategy as they cause you to lose money from having lots of goods tiles and gain money for being high on the development track and having lots of trading posts.

2. There should be more tension in competing for land/water travel routes. As is, there is no sense of pressure despite the seemingly intriguing random setup. There are just so many ways to score points that squeezing an extra point here or there from traveling in better directions isn't critical. It's actually more important to just not get pinned into a corner so that you can get your trading posts into play.

(Follow-up note - I've softened on this a bit, as I see that sometimes one path has much more valuable goods than another. Alternatively, you can use a technology wheel on either land or water and just use those paths for easier movement.)

3. You are most likely going to have to get to 4 or 5 on the development track and have a lot of trading posts (plus "person" chits) to win, both because of the end-game multiplier scoring and because of the way events reward players during the game. This, along with the availability of all level I/II black add-on tiles and all events always being the same makes each game feel similar.

I'm no game designer, but I envision a more dynamic game in which players start with more chits in the bag and have to decide whether to "donate" (trash) early to get a tight engine going or build up a big pool of chits. The optimal engine would depend strongly on the map setup, varied events for that particular game (which are drawn and known before the game begins), a limited number of level I/II tiles available, etc. I guess I'm looking for something more analogous to Dominion.

Despite my problems with the game, I give it a 6 for its attempts at innovation with the bag building mechanic.

RATING: 3
Orleans is a dull and boring point salad cube-pusher with a dubious theme.  The  "bag building" mechanism is merely a variation of deck building, which I hate. The goods seemed silly as their only difference was what they were worth at game end, as you never spent them for anything logical (like grain for gold). 

I will never agree to play it again. In fact, I could tell five minutes into the explanation I was going to dislike it, as it was obviously not my cup of tea. I just didn't know by how much. Yet it was clear 30 minutes into play I just wanted it to be over. BGG says it takes 90 minutes. Ha! My displeasure only grew as our four-player game went on for 2 hours and 35 minutes.

I enjoy the bag building part quite a bit, but the rest of the game feels so boring. The events (except the pest) have almost no influence (including the majority of pawns) of the outcome. Either I lose some money or I get some. Then the town hall, I mean I like the idea behind it, but it does not seem to work that well. The setup of the game is too similar for my taste, it needs more variability.
I wish there would be individual "missions" (eg. collect a set of goods) to gain points or somewhat similar. Areas that get accessible in the course of the game and so on. Things that increases the replayability.

That said, Orléans is not as bad as it may sound, but has some weak points.

I wanted the deluxe edition but it’s way too pricey so I went onto the DLP website and picked up the Invasion expansion along with the dlp component upgrades + shipping - all for cheaper than a deluxe TMG version. Also my wife loves the Co-op Invasion so we play. #winning.

My surprise third favorite game at Salt Con. Based on the play throughs I thought I would hate this. But I really enjoyed building my engine, making my player board be more efficient and using my special buildings. I clearly miscalculated the number of people I could win (despite winning the majority) vs the number of Trade Houses others could build. I also though the multiplier applied to the trade goods. Still, really had a lot of fun and look forward to trying this one again sometime.

I just updated this to a 10. I can't get enough of it. I love trying all the different strategies.  Works fantastically as a 2 player as well as 3 or 4. Playtime for us is right at 90 minutes as the box says, which is long enough to thoroughly enjoy without overstaying its welcome.  Definitely looking forward to playing this more.

Ein gelungenes Spiel. Auch wenn einige der Gebäude etwas unausgewogen scheinen. Statt wie bei Dominion einen Kartendeck aufzubauen, wird hier ein Sack mit neuem Inhalt bestückt aus dem dann blind gezogen wird. Klasse Idee!

Clever, simple engine building.  Lots of choices to make and areas to compete in.  Semi-simultaneous turns make the early game move quickly, but slows down hard as players manage more pieces.

Neat game where you pull tokens out of a bag, use them on your personal board to trigger powers (such as purchasing other tokens - like a deck-builder, travel across the map collecting goods, build trading posts, build buildings (allowing you actions that are only available to you, or send them on deeds (where they leave your pool but you gain status or money). It's interesting trying to optimize your token pool and how to tactically play the tokens you do draw. My big fear, and we'll need to see, is that it seems like this may be a game with an optimal strategy, almost like something you could program in ahead of time.

I was somewhat surprised how much the different ways of scoring points kept me from enjoying the bag-building part in my first game. Luck (or lack thereof) of drawing the right, or at least a good mixture of, workers seemed quite relevant. I am worried that more than two players would turn the spatial part of the map into a somewhat arbitrary thing that could sort of randomly screw people out of points.

I rather enjoyed this one.  The bag building was excellent.  There is quite a bit going on between your own player board, the traveling board, the "retirement" board (that's what I'm calling the one where your workers go to generate citizens), and the resource tracks.  Lots to balanace, but it manages to work well.

Some interesting features, especially the bag building and how it's connected to the various tracks. However, the game felt repetitive and long. It is sufficiently engrossing for a few plays but it lacks dynamism, especially for two players, and I think it would be too long for three or four players. It's an OK resource conversion Euro with one clever idea.

Bag builder which gives me the same feeling as Castles of Burgundy. Medieval bingo (~ Augustus). Not too heavy multi-player solitaire game - includes a solitaire version too which is interesting too. My wife wasn't overly impressed but I do like it. Looking for the expansion to arrive to have some solitaire and coop plays of it.

I have to be honest, I didn't fell in love with it, but I have a feeling that this will be an acquired taste, much like Roll for the Galaxy that I also wasn't impressed with when I first played it...

My issue with this gameplay was that luck played a huge role in my game... I realize now that I should have sent more guys to the Town Hall and should have done it sooner too... but still I had some Monks (the yellow guys that are wilds)... I had the Building that turns Boatmen (blue) into any guys other than the Monks and the Knights and I also had the building that turned scholars into any kind of other guys too...
so I had pretty much 3 types of guys that were wilds and there were turns that I gotten 3 farmers, 1 craftsman, 1 trader and 1 knight from the bag!!

It frustrated me... I see that there's a game there that I'm going to like a lot but this first game left a sour taste in my mouth... 

I think it also helps a LOT to know the buildings that we can build ahead of time so we can go for the ones we want.

Another thing that for me let's the game down is the quality of the components, specially the different workers... they are thin cardboard when they should have been wooden pieces all along... specially taking in consideration the price of the game at retail... it's not a cheap game but the bits and pieces aren't of the best quality and that's a big No-No!
(Yes, I know there's an upgrade pack... there shouldn't be an upgrade pack... it should be in the retail game from the start!)

An interesting take on deck-building where you effectively shuffle each round (only you're drawing from a bag). Plays pretty smoothly. Thematic-ish as deck-builders go.

RATING: 6
This is a wholly abstract point-salad game.  You get get action-selection chits, put them in a bag and then randomly pull them.  The actions available to you are limited by what chits you pull.  Buying chits and putting them in your bag is supposed to be like "deck-building", but it is an inferior mechanism for 2 reasons: (1) you don't get enough or pull enough to make the differences in distribution significant. (2) you are not guaranteed to see a chit ever again.  In short, as a base mechanic, it is a bit too random for my taste.  That said, the game is a fine, unoffensive, solitary Euro with some in-game tension that comes from the frustrating chit-pulls.   
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Sounds like a game that we would enjoy that can be won by different mechanisms. Theme a little thin, but ok. Build an engine and watch it run. Use bag to pull chits to use to get stuff. Many different ways to score points.

Orleans hatte mich durch die etwas biedere Aufmachung eher abgeschreckt. Ja, natürlich versuchen die Grafiken hier die mittelalterliche Kunst der Merowinger bzw Karolinger zu adaptieren und trotzdem, in Kombination mit dem eher cartoonhaften Stil, hat mich das Gesamtergebnis nicht angesprochen. Durch eine Rabattaktion, konnte ich Orleans dann sehr günstig erwerben und wollte dem Spiel eine Chance geben. Eine absolut richtige Entscheidung, denn Orleans ist ein großartiges Spiel. Die Mechanik mit Mix aus Worker-Placement und "Bag Building" - ja man sammelt unterschiedliche Arbeiterfiguren in seinem Stoffsäckchen" - ist toll und funktioniert einwandfrei. Die Spieldauer ist mit 16 Runden und ca 60 Minuten angenehm kurz, so dass man an einem Abend auch mehrere Partien hintereinander spielen kann. Die Aktionsmöglichkeiten erinnern ein wenig an Village, es gibt unterschiedliche Stationen, die man mit seinen Arbeitern aktivieren kann. So bietet Orleans eine Vielzahl an unterschiedlichen Strategien zum Sieg. Möchte man möglichst viele Städte besuchen, dort Kontore errichten und dabei wertvolle Warenplättchen einsammeln? Konzentriert man sich eher auf die Entwicklungsleiste, um dort seinen Faktor für die Siegpunkte zu erhöhen? Beteiligt man sich fokussiert an der Fertigstellung der Segensreichen Werke? Orleans ist Abwechslung pur, es ist Strategisch, doch nicht zu kompliziert. Ich empfehle auch unbedingt die Erweiterung, die spannende Szenarien für Solospieler, 2 Spieler oder Kooperative Spieler hinzufügt.

Bag building game with resource chits in a bag. Various tracks for progression using the resources etc. it's a do this to get that and then get that style game. The luck of drawing from your bag can be mitigated somewhat but ultimately determines whether you can do a lot of things in the round or just sit and watch. 
It is worrying when those who had played before suggested cutting the game by 3 rounds, which was accepted by the other players half way through as the game feels too long.

RATING: 7.5
Very entertaining game that dangles many attractive strategic and tactical opportunities to its players. Simultaneous play makes the rounds fly by. I wish turn order weren't static clockwise each round. It can make a big difference when two players are racing for cities who gets to go first, and there's no way to manipulate that.

Game has a few neat concepts with the bag building. It's just not my cup of tea. I can see why people love it. For some reason it just doesn't do it for me. Maybe a little too much happening?

One of the things that you can tell how good a game is by the end scoring.  If you can score in the 100's and everyone be within 10 points of each other.....fantastic!  I love that there are many different things to do that score you points but not too overwhelmingly.  Love the bag building also!

A boring, dull, cube-pusher of a game. I'm so glad I played Hyperborea before this one, because Orleans could have completely turned me off to bag building. There's absolutely no rhyme or reason to this game. You're just doing various actions to score points in the end. It kind of gave me a similar vibe to Hansa Teutonica, in that it was a very dry, soulless experience where points felt very arbitrary. Complete stinker of a game.

RATING: 5
The bag mechanism of Orléans is interesting. You cannot control which actions you draw from the bag but you can control wich actions you put there. However, I'm not sure a game challenge should come from restricting your actions. Furthermore, since you have so many actions to choose between anyway, the game is more of a solitaire race exercise than an interactive engagement.

In this bag building game, players generate people in medeival Orleans. The various types of people are monks, farmers, knights, scholars and so forth. The people go into a bag, and you only pull a certain amount of people out per turn to use. You use people to get more people, build trading posts, travel to collect goods or get more tiles to use them. 

This is a very tense game, with lots of choices and decisions. At some point you realize you are not getting the right people out of the bag or not enough of them and there are many things you have to pay attention to.
There are different strategies to pursue and it is very fun. Now, the events such as a plague could conspire against you to force you to lose a person you just recruited, or you can't get the right mix in your draws, but those sorts of games are rare, and generally you do have a chance to work around the bad luck. 

We do play with the advanced rule where everyone gets to remove a building which makes each game very interesting. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Setup took about 10 min and a little AP inducing. Gameplay was good though, but it felt a teeny tiny bit random with the draw. It was also hard to see the board's extra board where you sent people permanently since it took so much table space. It felt a bit sandboxy and replayable though. Deckbuilder esque and good engine game too.

Didnt play with all rules quite right as we put out all the tiles, even for 5p, so it wasnt as tight as expected.  There were some minor things we missed, but the mechanics are good and theme amd art interesting and cool!

After 3 plays, Im finding that even though its a bit sandboxy, there is a limit to the number of effective strategies. I did wool and cloth all game for 9 pts a turn or usually even more but still lost semi significantly to guildhalls. I just wonder how truly sandboxy and freeform it is. Downtime is still simpler and easier to deal with and engine aspect is cool still but I found Dominion's engine simpler, faster, more variety and probably more fun imo (though this doesnt drag like some Dominion games do)

Imo its a solid 7 ish, but not more.

EDIT: Reading some strategy related stuff, it seems development track is nigh necessary in some regard and that there may just be 1 or so other strategies aside from it (dev track gives most points with multiplier and lots of money from events). Events toward end are nigh worthless and things like plague and draw are a bit annoying. I'm gonna trade this now because of all these things. Also large table footprint and setup, and the goods aren't honestly differentiated - they're just points...

Wanted to like Orléans far more than I actually did. Everything worked and played cleanly enough, but I just couldn't find the fun. Effect of randomness from the chit draw was stronger than expected, and the engine building never really came together in a way that I enjoyed.

Maybe the disappointment is my own fault for going in with expectations that it would be something I love?

A perfect engine building game.  It is amazing how fast this plays once you get over the initial shock of seeing the plethora of pieces and actions in the game.  There are multiple paths to victory, and it is a game that definitely benefits from multiple playthroughs to get a sense of both the events and special action tiles.  The bag building mechanic is a phenominal means of combining customization, randomness, and luck mitigation.  The actions may be a little too abstracted to allow the theme to fully take hold, but I am a fan of the theme nonetheless.  Both the beneficial deeds and travelling could be a little more interesting and impactful, but that is a small complaint.

Orléans is a good game, probably my favorite with a Pool Building mechanic, and yet there is nothing about it that particularly excites me. As I have had difficulty in finding a decent Deck/Pool Builder I am tempted to own Orléans, but I know I'd always be looking for something better to replace it.

Orléans' artwork is terrible. I looks like a child was trying to imitate the woodcut style of the era. The style would have matched the theme well had they only gotten an artist with more talent.

I'd say the most annoying thing about the game is hearing people unsuccessfully try to pronounce Orléans like a Frenchman and having someone repeatedly correct them all. Thank you Ross, you can shut up now.

RATING: 7.25
this game currently has a rare (for a euro) 8.0 or higher average rating, and I'm not quite seeing it, or it shows I'm a step off from the mainstream preference here with the way I favor tactical gameplay. This game is almost a pure engine builder, with very little opportunity for game-generated variation (as opposed to the euros with highly randomized elements in the initial setup/gameplay, which encourage decisions at a tactical level in reaction to the randomization). The variation here must then come from the other players in the game, and I'm gathering that there is a yearning for games such as those, in which players play each other rather than each other and the game. Or perhaps I'm discounting the "populace-shaping" element (aka deckbuilding/bagbuilding), which I don't much favor (I like *other* elements of Eminent Domain and Trains, and dislike Hyperborea, Dominion, and CCGs universally) At any rate, my experience was: I liked the simultaneity of it but chafe at the scripted nature of the engines. It reminds me of Hansa Teutonica, which I rated similarly. That said, my rating isn't far off from the average, but usually with modern euros like these, I find I'm rating with a 1-2 point premium to the average.

RATING: 7
This one has potential but - at least in a two player game - it seems to have issues.   The map is not very tight so its very easy to build trading posts in any city.  If you can acquire some monks, then it seems very easy to take any action you want.   And with so many rounds, the last several all seem to end up being the user taking the same actions to generate points.    There's a lot to like conceptually with this one, but it doesn't seem to work well for us at two players.

We last played by restricting the map to the top of the board, and removing three random time tiles for a shorter, tighter game.  This helped some, but the trading posts was still the winning strategy.   We're really not sure about this one.

RATING: 8.2
There are complaints about the quality of the components, but I found them to be quite good in my French version.

Some people say it's a polished version of [thing=119788]Hyperborea[/thing], but they are only similar in their bag-building mechanism, and even that works in a different way. Orléans is an original game with a perfect mix of strategy, tactic, interaction and luck. It's one of those games where you want to do all actions, you're already thinking 2-3 turns ahead and you can't wait until you do this and that. But watch out! If your opponents do this other thing before you, you would lose this benefit to them!

Games are quite fluid, even with 4 players, because most of the turn happens simultaneously and the number of players will not affect its lenght as much as in other games. Nevertheless, there are some slower moments while some player thinks over a very difficult decision.

Orléans promises many different paths to victory, but I'm not sure about that. I don't think there's a winning strategy, but they are not infinite either. In any case, all your actions will be influenced by the random pieces you draw each turn, the random events and the quite unpredictable actions of your opponents; rest assured: there will be not 2 games alike.

Overall, I'm quite hapy with it up to now and I'm looking forward to play it more and explore different strategies.

The Siberia bag system expanded into a gamer's game, and with every player having their own bag. I really like the dynamics of having to actively kill your dudes to clean up the bag, and there is quite a bit of competition for time-sensitive moves as well.

Even though the game is somewhat thinky early on, the decision tree gets smaller towards the end, speeding up the game. There might be a risk of the game getting stale after a few plays but so far it seems interesting.

Grandissimo gioco. E' un classico piazzamento lavoratori con dinamiche interessanti. Verso la fine della partita diventa un solitarione specie se al consiglio e sulla mappa non si trova più modo di interagire, nel gioco comunque, specie nelle prime fasi non manca l'interazione, sia diretta che indiretta. Gioco ben bilanciato perché offre diverse strategie. Nel complesso ha anche il pregio di non essere complesso ma essere profondo. Un gioco che consiglio senza timore.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]I'm up in the air with Orleans and would like to get an opportunity to play again so that I can decide what I think (this hasn't happened in part because I don't own the game and my buddy sold his copy). I definitely enjoyed both plays, but wonder if certain paths lead to victory while others seem to be much less viable. As far as bag builders go this is by far my favorite, I really enjoy how the different mechanisms of the game are quite intuitive. Orleans isn't a game that needs repeated play before you become proficient making it a great light to medium weight Euro.

I came close to buying this after playing, but I have so many games of this weight that I'm not sure it would get played all that often and I know that I could probably get some folks to play it in my game group. I am enamored with the bag building mechanism, but I think I'll continue to pass for now until I have a chance to play a few more times.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]A highly enjoyable bag building game. The use of tokens and a bag removes the tedium of constant card shuffling and offers a nice tactile element to the game. There seem to be multiple strategies to explore, but I have one concern in regards to this. Since all the buildings are available from the beginning of each game (similar to Caverna) I wonder if certain buildings will become "must buys" because they are more powerful/versatile than others. I've only played once so I am not sure, but looking through the buildings there definitely seem to be some that appeared weaker than the others. Time will tell, and again I am not even sure it is an issue. I do know that I'm definitely looking forward to more plays.

Quick update - I actually got a second play in right at the end of the month, this time with 3 players. This play alleviated some of my concerns with some buildings being much better than others. We all tried different strategies and buildings and in the end I think we were only separated by 16 points. Pretty impressive for a game with a lot of different scoring opportunities. After this play I am closer to picking up a copy because the rule set is very intuitive, making it easy to teach/learn and after two plays there seems to be a lot of different strategies you can explore.[/i]

Decent game. The action selection system is weird though and does't work well. You're constantly waiting to see what other players are doing and then adjusting your actions, which makes other players want to change theirs too/again. Point salad of collecting different things. Bag building concept is ok, but had higher expectations of this game.

Bag-building, yay! In Orleans, every player tries to make as many actions you can every round. Every action takes at least two of your pieces, either farmers, workers, scholars, or monks. The actions are either getting more pieces (kinda like your workforce), upgrading the power of your pieces, getting spaces or "buildings" only for you. For any Euro fan, I think Orleans is a must. Almost every aspect of the game reminded me of my favorite Euros: the traveling mechanic from Concordia, deck-building from Dominion, influence tracks from Terra Mystica. Although the randomness of your draws may impact your strategy for your turn, I found it as a challenge; what steps can I take to lower the randomness for my draws and use the pieces efficiently? I feel like most Euros reward the 
"A Little Bit Of Everything" strategy, so I'm glad to see that Orleans run the opposite way. It's better to triumph in one dimension of the game, then do okay in all of them. I love Orleans because it satisfied my taste for a Euro, but it bent the game in little, sometimes frustrating ways. Which I loved. Orleans is a great addition to the Euro genre and I definitely recommend it.

RATING: 7
I liked it a lot, but am hesitant about rating it higher in the fear that it's too sandbox-y to provide a substantially different playing experience from game to game. With all tech immediately available, there are many paths to explore to determine which approach of tech or non-tech paths provides best efficiency. But the only game randomizer is the order in which the events come out which you have no control over and may either hurt or hinder your strategy unknowingly. There's are interactive race elements with board presence and finishing engine tracks, but these are slow-to-develop races. Maybe that's enough, don't know. But it at least provides multiple paths to explore in the first instance and that's half the battle won. My fear is that the second half of riding that learning curve may be a little too abstract to engender replay. Happy to play, but I don't need to buy.

Excellent game.  It's not heavy, and certain aspects of this game reminds me of other worker-placement games where you race to advance on scoring tracks.  It is also similar to a deck-builder in that you collect a variety of tiles in your bag to use each turn.  But although the mechanisms are familiar, they are still implemented in a very creative way, which makes for a truly unique experience.

I'm going to wait a bit before I rate this one. It is a deep euro although mechanically, it is very simple. It is just that, much like recent Uwe Rosenberg games, there are just so many things you can do. For that reason, I would say it is a bit of a sandbox game. Looking forward to playing this more before I rate it.

Update: I've played it a few times and i love it. When my biggest complaint is the flimsy bags for storing the components, there is a lot more that is good than what is bad. I love how each game is very different each time you play it and no one strategy will work every time. A winner.

RATING: 4
Thought this would be a lot heavier than it turned out to be. Set up is a bitch, by far the longest of any of my games and that includes Trajan. The low complexity is not worth the long set up time. 

Pluses:

- great components. Why are people complaining about components? Thick tiles, nice bags. I Actually went "wow!" when opening the box. Punching tiles was very easy, no rips, and there is smooth satin finish to everything that makes handling them a pleasant tactile experience.  
- bag builder mechanic is a first for me and fun.
- lof ear strategy when you have few workers. 
- game teaches fast and plays very fast with two. Definitely a gateway game.

Neg

- very lame events. Only one, the plague, is hitting hard and only if it happens early. We didn't hurt or care about any of the others. Never had a torture. Money is abundant.
- very solitaire. The only time I watch opponent is over the buildings (townhall) placement, as first player moving can complete a building first and take the citizen borfre you get it,
- everything is worth simple points. It's just a race to get the best goods.
- I fell for the hype on this and don't think it deserves it. Close to '100 ranking'on bgg is far too high, and an obvious 'cult of the new' ranking. It's a simple, gateway game and I don't really like gateways. Not much thinking involved, though that might be a plus for some.
- Some buildings are very weak, like sacristy. There is no reason to build this with events not hurting you. 
- easy to forget to pull back workers from your extra building action spaces as the tiles sit near your main board and are not as easily spotted. I left two monks on a tile for three turns before I noticed they were still there. 
- buying many trading houses is clearly a winning strategy. This cannot be ignored.
- map route competiton nonexistant with 2 players. Too easy to build a path and head off on your own. 
- once you have many workers, choices are all obvious and fairly easy to do.

Played once so far, three players: 
I like the mechanics buying different action-chits and drawing them from a bag. It's exactly like Hyperborea cube drawing. 
Unfortunately it becomes a little repetitive and the game feels too long. 

Have played it a few more times now and it grows on you so I have to raise my rating a little. 

The place tiles are quite unbalanced, which might even kingmake the starting player. With the "advanced" rules that each player may discard one place tile before the game starts solves that somewhat.  

Have played this quite some times now, and even though it was one of the EuropeMasters games for 2015 (wich usually mean you're fed up with the game after all practising) I still enjoy it, and have changed my rating accordingly. 

All miniexpansions changes the game a lot. Maybe one should add a random set of place tiles each game to make it more varied. The extra money in the new edition and the expansion changes the game a lot too, since more than one person can use a money gathering strategy without running out. My friend experienced this in a bad way at EuropeMasters, since we practised with the first edition, but competed with the new edition, which made it possible for two persons to gather over 70 coins. Both beat my friend.

RATING: 8
4 Plays - a bag building/ engine building game with a variety of strategies to try. The events, variety of buildings and variable map setup will allow for quite some replayability, though not endless. For players who play many times, the replayability will be in the strength of the gameplay and group dynamics (which can affect game play choices). 

My only nitpick, particularly for new players, are the numerous buildings each with a unique ability. These didn't seem accessible to me on my first few plays, as I just didn't care to look through so many different options when I could just ignore them and do something else. Having so many tiles laid out beside the board also just makes a game appear messy, fiddly and more visible to some players than others. This is something I really don't like about Caverna. Perhaps keeping the building tiles in two stacks on the board, along with each player having an aid of some kind could solve this.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
Really wanted to like it but it had a lot of features I find off-putting. Turns of unbalanced length (either between players or, in this case, the turns get longer and then loooooonger as the rounds go by) and so punishing: if you do something foolish on your first turn (like invest in monks!), you will lag behind--then far behind!--for the rest of the game. I also felt like the events were generic instead of immersive, pure randomizers instead of engaging, well, "events."
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
First I played only in co-operative mode (with expansion), you draw tokens from your supply and then use them in sets to trigger actions. You can grow your supply to get more actions and options while you move around a board and collect items to feed the city. It was very close and I would like to play a tougher scenario next time, but the only way to do that is to change the personal goals. The game play is a lot of fun, with nice mechanics. We then played a versus mode which was tougher overall as there are a lot of races on the tracks to get the point multipliers and this was equally fun (as were all other expansions).

RATING: 5
A decent twist on deck building and better than most other deck builders I have played. It is an unabashed euro spreadsheet game.  That is not always a criticism as there are spreadsheet games I enjoy. Orleans, however, is  on the bloated side.   Some of the different areas of the board/game seem quite tacked on and a little forced.  For instance:  "I just collected a piece of cheese. What do I do with it?  Nothing.  It's just two points at the end."  And money is also almost pointless as you rarely use it except for points at the end. I also think the events should have been left out of the game completely.  They add nothing to the game. But in spite of that, there are several good decision points and I am willing to play it again.  However, it is not a game I feel compelled to buy.

Orleans is a "pouch-building" game--throughout the game you acquire tokens of different types to go into your pouch, and each turn you pull a certain number of tokens out of your pouch which determine what kind of actions you can do.  Players have a player board where they assign their tokens to various actions, all of which require multiple different tokens to fire.  Most of the action spaces allow a player to take a new token of a specific type, and advance on that token's track, each of which have different abilities.  Some of the track abilities include taking more tokens out of the bag each turn, being able to choose a building tile that gives you another possible action, end-game multiplier bonuses, etc.  There were a few action spaces that didn't give you more tokens--these let you move your pawn around a map board to pick up goods chits (worth points) or establish trading posts (for the end-game multiplier), and a final action spot let you "retire" tokens to a central board for a couple of points (this seemed more aimed at giving players something to do on the last turn, rather than allowing a hardcore pouch-thinning strategy).  Overall, I really enjoyed this game--it's not really too ambitious, but it executes the pouch-building idea really well, and it was fun to build up on the tracks and gain new action spaces.  I worry about replay value though, as some tracks and buildings seemed a lot better than others.

Interesting take on the "deck building" genre. Getting various pieces that you draw out of a bag and immediately put back in once you use them really makes you consider how you're building your bag. You may continue to draw the old tiles that you just used instead of the new ones that you bought. I liked how everything was open, although it did feel a bit solitaire.

You know, for a game that isn't really THAT unique, I appreciate the open-endedness of it and I look forward to trying out some unique/interesting combos or strategies. I worry there might be a "correct" way to play, but I have yet to figure it out yet.

Includes the deluxe wooden pieces and 5th player kit.

Slight downgrade, the freshness wears of a bit after 10 games or so.

***

It's fun to control and manage the followers in your bag. Trick is to think ahead and maximize the chances to draw the ones you want when you need them. Sometime you need to send some of the less desirable ones of to beneficial deeds or make sure some of them are not returning to the bag by leaving them on spots/track on the player board, maybe restrain to activate a "ready" building for a round, just so they don't "pollute" the bag. Keeping track of the turnorder and who is doing what is important. The pulverturm (gunpowdertower) is a powerful building.. 

Two 2-player and two 3-player games so far.. it is getting better with each play. 

Love the art

Very interesting concept of bag-building -> chit-pulling -> chit combinaton allocation to available actions. This game does not have the common ground with other deck/pool building games in the sense that you dont actually go through all the chits in your bag. Most of the chits go back to your bag each turn (there is no discard pile). So for example, if you have acquired 5 monks (a powerful, wildcard chit) and have a total of 15 chits, and draw 5 per turn you could still possibly pull only 1 of them during three turns. So this adds some luck element to the game. Then again the many different possibilities to allocate chits and score points mitigate this luck somewhat and make it a solid and strategical game.

Call me a cube fetischist, but pushing cubes and building bags full of useful followers is truly exiting! Orléans is streamlined and easy to grasp but makes for a challenging set of decisions. Maybe the strongest point of the game is the sense of accomplishment you get not only at the end of the game, but also during play. A game I feel has great longevity and I always look forward to the next session. One point from a perfect 10 because of lengthy set-up time and the added edit below.

Edit: Only negative, as with any strategy game with minimal luck (or at least lots of ways to mitigate luck with draws from the bag), is that you can easily fall into the same, or very similar, strategy for every game. So it helps if players are at the same level. This can also be mitigated by taking out 1-2 buildings/player each game, possibly limiting strategy somewhat.

Very good game with long term strategies, tactical plays, and often tough decisions. To me, Orleans is among the top gamers games.
Among the negatives:

* Some luck due to tile drawing from the bag.
* Could be too long with 4 players as it's prone to analysis paralysis.
* Rather long setup and somewhat fiddly.
* The Pilgrimage Tiles add little if any to the game, but I suppose they are necessary as the game clock.

[floatleft][ImageID=2776673][/floatleft]I really enjoyed playing Orléans. I thought managing disks in your bag was an excellent feature of the game. I would gladly play again and will definitely consider adding this to my collection. My one real gripe is that the building action is terrible. Allowing players to choose from ANY building really brings the pace of the game to a screeching halt while they look through every single building which have all distinct abilities and vague symbology.

Behind some terrible box art lies a very slick game: it was amusing that the rules explanation took a fifth of the time that set-up did. Game-play rocks along at a good pace (no AP-players, yay!) and we ended with a really tense draw from the bags, needing one knight between us to win the scenario (we did, yay!). Being a more pacifist-type player, the co-op mode suited me and I'm not sure how I'd take to what looked like a fairly cutthroat competitive game, but I can certainly admire the simple - elegant (yes, that word again) - design. Tres bon.

Engine building, worker placement, 'bag/pool-building', medium heavy Euro. Similar to deck building, but here your recruited workers go into a grab bag (fairly unique). Resource Scarcity! Various strategies and options to explore. Low player interaction, 2 hour optimization puzzle. Multi track/mechanic boards (map - route building, 'good deeds' - a la cult track Terra Mystica, progress tracks)

-Theme irrelevant, long set up time, no variable set up (same puzzle each time). Lacking English components (original edition, check carefully). Fiddly end game scoring. Can be AP prone, turns get longer as game progresses (game can slow down and may overstay its welcome), player skill/familiarity will produce some lopsided scores.

This game was really fantastic. You spend these worker tokens on your player board to activate actions, then you put your tokens back into your bag to be redrawn randomly in future turns. You have a limited space for workers "on deck" so to speak, so you need to keep your guys busy, otherwise you wind up with wasted draws. You also get to construct new action spaces for yourself, and you get to put little wheels on locations, which act as a permanent worker for that spot alone, helping you ease the need for excessive worker type diversity. The real goal of the game is to get houses, or man tokens, and then amp your multiplier up, before the event clock runs out. The game plays very very fast, so although at the start of the game the event pile looks high, before you know it, it's empty. The upgraded tokens from the KS will be a very welcome change to the game, as the small worker tokens could sort of get stuck in the corner of the bag if you didn't jangle it around severely enough. Currently I feel like I'd be willing to play this again pretty much anytime.

An interesting bag building / engine building game. I like the variety of options, and the way that they build on each other to give a real sense of progress over the course of the game. I don't like the fairly low interaction between players, and how much time it takes to look through all the options. Especially for new players, you have to either decide not to explore a lot of the options or just take a very long time on your turn reading through them and asking what the more complicated ones do. It's definitely the kind of game you need to play a couple of times before you understand most of the potential combos. It also takes quite a while to set up and tear down, and the end game scoring feels a bit anticlimactic and unfulfilling for how long the game takes to play.

The scoring mechanic with the guildhalls and citizens puts pressure on everyone to get them quickly. The variability with the buildings and the setup of the goods makes this game replayable as well. An instant favorite!

RATING: 8
Uses tokens and a bag rather than a deck builder. Most actions require multiple tokens to fire. What you can do is limited by the tokens drawn from the bag. 
Not very interactive since each player has his own board and actions. The primary interaction is a race to get bonuses first and when tokens begin to run out. Before limits kick in you don't have pay too much attention to turn order.
However, it does fit together well, you can win in all the tracks like most worker placement you still need to work counter cyclic to other players. The limited draw means you need to use the efficiently as possible and perhaps save some for a bigger next turn.
The different tracks allow you to get more tokens some are only available that way. Get a building to get additional actions, end game multipliers, move a pawn around to build houses for scoring and collect goods for scoring. Retire tokens to bonus areas, bunches of ways to score points

Streamlined and enjoyable to play, but glad to play someone else's copy and have no need to own

[ESP] Disfruto jugarlo pero no me parece la joya de juego que es para muchos, siento que no hay tantos caminos para hacer puntos y es más bien el timing para ganar ciertas acciones a los demás jugadores lo que puede determinar el ganador y que no hay forma de cambiar el orden de turno. Justo el hecho de que sea intentar hacer lo mismo y que se defina en un turno o dos es lo que no me acaba de gustar. Pero aun así me parece buen juego.

Fun worker placement/bag building/point salad game.  I was worried about the bag building part of this game, but you control what you're adding and you can easily get rid of pieces you don't want.  I do think the building tiles that let you get resources are a bit unbalanced, but otherwise, this is a fun game about being efficient and getting a lot of points.  Theme is pointless though.

The game gradually becomes more intense round after round. After the halfway point is when you need to really be looking at your opponents actions and planning for the end of the game. 18 rounds seems like a lot but I feel like the game should have more. Just when it gets good it ends, this leaves me wanting to play again which is what I desire in a game. This is easily in my top 5 favorite games played.(Play with the new bathhouse rule)

rating would be higher, but the tableau for getting citizens from the beneficial deeds board makes it difficult to plan. This and the clockwise choosing of single persons and actions in phases 4 and 5 of each round make the game longlasting - more than it should be. However, all in all great game.

Nothing really bad about it.  More than anything it seems like a mechanic in search of a game.  Would play again but would not request.

I wonder if people would play such a game with no theme at all?  Just colored disks to put on the spots and a abstract network in place of the map.

I would love to see a retheme where you are feeding sweets to fat children in order to make preform better in school, but as the bag gets fatter they find it harder to concentrate.

Unfortunately this game is not for me. 
Its bland, uninteresting, too loose to offer any meaningful decisions. 
Somehow I don't find it interesting to pull out chits from a bag, just to place them somewhere, so that I can buy more chits into my bag. 
The culling mechanics is there, but again, no tension there, you are putting the chits on a separate board in a loose race for filling up rows with pre-defined chits for each position. 
Then there is also a board with a map of the county around Orleans where you can race for grabbing goods and laying down contorhouses, but again, pretty bland.... :(
 This is the kind of point salad which usully leave me utterly cold: a billion ways to get points but no central, overarching  mechanics which elevates this game from being mediocre. 
This also means, that Alteplano is also out of my wishlist: the game is from the same designer, the fundation of both games is the same (bag-building), and according to the general opinion Alteplano seems to be the worse game from the two....

Great game! For a short while I though it had replaced Roll for the Galaxy, but I eventually came around deciding I like RftG better just because of the sheer variability in RftG.

I love Orleans, I really do - but I don't think it's a game I want to play over and over as the variability ain't as great at it might appear. I definitely recommend always removing a few buildings before the game begins to force different tactics.

I disagree with the complaints about luck of the draw - it is very easy to trim your bag to fit just the strategy you're going for. Sure, you'll have that odd round where you just don't draw those monks you really need, but with 18 rounds it's not an issue.

RATING: 6
I'll rate this a 6 after one play. I have a horrible feeling that 6 is a very mean score to give. But I just can't get beyond the fiddliness of aspects of Orleans.

Orleans is a nice, sedate game of worker placement, area control and engine-building ... but one that has a messy 'interface'.

At the start of each round players draw many of their tokens out of their bag randomly and then place them in colour combinations on their tableu/buildings in order to activate various abilities/cubes. It is time-consuming and hard to plan for. And is it OK to peek at where other players are putting theirs, as it may be important? You then resolve those actions on various shared boards/tracks.

If that makes it sound like a chore, it kind-of is. Which is a shame, as there are plenty of options and combinations with which to experiment.

You can get a similar, less fiddly game experience from something like New Bedford (watch out for its huge errata) or Lords of Waterdeep. Or, better, how about the excellent Caylus or Bruxelles 1893.

Very well designed Euro game with bag-building as the central mechanism. All mechanism work really well and it is certainly a good game, but to me in Orleans all mechanisms have no thematic integration at all and the game is a soulless victory point salad: There is some point track that in the multiplies with the number of buildings you have for VPs at the end; there are different councils to send your workers too; if you complete a council you get a person that also multiplies with the track; goods give you points; money give you points; there are special building for every single mechanism of the game; etc. In the end, Orleans combines all negative aspects a (still well working) Euro can have.

Update: Have played it again and I liked it a bit more. But still there is little interaction, which is restricted to racing on different tracks. The action mechanism is kind of innovative, but to me not really exciting. It feels similarly disconnected as all leading mechanisms in Feld games do.

RATING: 7.8
(+) Bag builder with some really nice and interesting engine building aspects

(+) Different ways to approach the game

(+) Accessible: structured game flow, easy rules, reasonable play time, yet challenging enough

(-) Some luck dependence due to some of the events.

(-) A little too much luck dependence due to the fact that your bag doesn't run out before you refill. This means the same workers can come out over and over again, while others remain 'stuck' in the bag. In my opinion this game would have been a lot better if used workers go in a seperate 'used workers pool' per player, and only get recycled when the entire bag runs out.

(-) If you want to score points with the book-track and houses: make sure you go for houses first! Bear in mind that the university track in order to move up on the book-track can also run out, but this will only be a problem in the second half of the game (and can be mitigated with certain tiles).

Orleans is not a bad game, definitely, but it does not work as a whole as well as I had wished.

I have been meaning to try with 4 to see if the travelling part is more than just a VP opportunity to take whenever practical for a start.

The Town Hall loses much of its function when too few players are taking part... if this is a concern see my variant in the forums.

A fun bag-builder, but I found playing the game was a bit more samey than I was expecting when learning the game.  Once you get your drawing # up, and maybe building a few buildings, you kind of max out your engine building capacity and are just trying to get as many guild halls down and max your tech level before the game ends.  Getting the people worth points is an interesting competition, but it also breaks the game in that you're supposed to be able to allocate your discs to actions simultaneously but because of this competition you need to wait to see if other players are going to beat you to the limited town hall spaces.  I feel like the game would have better if we were mostly competing for common places, like a standard worker placement game (although that would require some way to identify which people are yours to reclaim), but the general modern trend is for more multiplayer solitaire, optimizing your own boards, hence its popularity.

Orleans is a fairly abstract game where players draw different types of workers from a bag and place them on their own player boards to  different actions from traveling the countryside to educating there population training their villagers and  improving their clan.  The game  plays up to 4 players where they try to expand their population across the board at the same time trying increase the value of each settlement or nobleman.

Pros: Fun action selection mechanism with drawing workers from the bag, Creative point value balancing mechanism, Deep decision making, Sandbox style gameplay allows players to play however they would like.

--Feb2016-- Quite cool, all things considered.  I liked the game dynamics; found the endgame surprising; and was more than occasionally annoyed by the token draw from the bag.  Fortunately, one can do better with both of those last ones (though the final one will likely never be perfect!)  A fine game, but more random than things I prefer.  (And a bit better on 2nd play; though I'm still not convinced it's something I want to play often.)

I really enjoy the mechanics and the pacing of this one, but the way points are scored is rather uninteresting. There's no surprises. You know how everyone is doing the entire game, and if there's a runaway leader, which there was in both games I've played, you know your fate by the middle-game, and it kind of sucks all the fun out of it. I wish there were more interesting ways to score points to match the awesomely interesting mechanics. Bummer.

RATING: 7
Not bad, but not very exciting either. It's a solid points salad/worker salad game that gamers who enjoy low interaction planning games might really like. The more players the more interaction, so that's a good thing. The dice and cards have been replaced by a bag pulling mechanism. There's multiple paths to securing victory points, but first you're going to need to acquire a few more workers because it's 18 rounds long and you'll need to assemble a workforce before you start worrying about the points too much. There's some timing elements, especially in the Rathaus, and that's a good thing too. It's okay.

For me the game is saved by the technology tiles (craftsmen), and the place tiles. The race to grab the choice place tiles in particular lifts the game from drab to somewhat exciting. Everything is a race, but at the same time it all feels quite leisurely. Like Castle sit Burgundy this game has short quick turns that keeps the pace up and stops players from catching up on sleep. (I don't think I could stand it with the five player expansion.) There's always something you can do, something you probably should do and probably a way you can do it. 

Decent game that holds up to Mombasa and Castles of Burgundy. But it might be my last bag pulling game because it does the job well and one is enough. Scores tend to be close as players weave their different paths through the points maze. I'm a fan of the simple, logical rules and ease of jumping back into a game after a long break when the rules might be a bit foggy. The family seem to enjoy it more than I do.

I really enjoy many of the mechanics in Orleans, but I don't think there is enough player interaction or variability to keep me interested enough to play it a lot. I'd like to try playing it a few more times to try a few different things, and I'd like to try the expansion though.

This was another star of LT18 for me.  Totally enjoyed my play of it, more so than I thought I would.  The chip draw from the bag, the multiple choices, it really all works for me.  I really like it and this one has a good chance to go up for me.

This goes up to 9.  Love the deck-building mechanic with the workers.  I wish the event tiles were a little more varied, but there isn't anything that I don't like about this.

Q: What do you get if you cross a cube pushing engine building euro with a Dominion - an engine building deck builder? 
A: A box chock full of cardboard chits and wooden pieces and stuff. 

Orleans a.k.a. Dominion the boardgame, reminds you that cards were there for a reason (making the game cheaper and smaller). Basically you're buying people tokens, throwing them in a bag and pulling them out, and you need 2-3 of a specific kind to make an action. From there on it's pretty much a type of restricted Dominion - in the first part you're building an engine, later you're trying to get points; restriction of possible options allows for a few different takes on building the whole bag drawing thingy. There's no interaction and after an adding points exercise somebody wins.  

So, if you thought Dominion is too streamlined, elegant and too reminiscent of CCGs, here's it's done in an old school euro vibe with one of the drabbest visuals ever (worse than Concordia). There are progression spread sheet charts filling the board, there's a lot of stuff arranged in neat lines, waiting to be picked up, and somewhere in the air there hovers at least an impression of many choices - as is the trend in dreary euros these days. The game has one thing going for it - it is more strategic than all tactical VPS games coming out these days, even if shares certain piece galore symptoms with them.

On one hand it's refreshing too see a more strategic oriented euro, on the other hand it's got all the symptoms of boring old school euros. Yawn. I must say there's a serious lack of a frowny eurodude on the cover.

Played once with 4P. The central mechanism of Orléans is bag-building, where players pull tokens out of a bag every round and create specific combinations of tokens to take actions. Like all deckbuilders, there are ways to gain more tokens and eliminate them.

While I'm usually big on deckbuilders, I'm not quite sold on Orléans. The bagbuilding aspect is really just a means to the end of pursuing the different VP paths in the game, and I rarely prioritised the token I was taking in whenever I took an action.  The one bright spot worth mentioning is that the Beneficial Deeds board is a clever way to reward players for culling tokens.

Beyond the bagbuilding aspect is an ordinary paint-by-numbers Euro, where player generally race to go up on a variety of tracks. There is no doubt Orléans is a game which was simply waiting to be designed, but I'm not sure if the end result is worth the anticipation.

Player interaction is pretty minimal at the start, but as the game progresses it becomes dotted with screwage moments. I love the bag mechanic and the element of chance that brings. I think the artwork is great too. It's also pretty simple to play and teach. A current fave!

Incredible bag building game, that creates an emerging asymmetry that develops as the game progresses.

Advanced players that complain that each game plays the same if playing optimally should be playing the advanced variant that allows each player to remove a building of their choice before the game begins.

I ended up buying the DLP 5 player expansion as turns are taken simultaneously so it plays very quickly.

[4 plays] A chip rather than card based version of Dominion crossed with Goa, Village, La Citta, and Hansa Teutonica. I've really enjoyed learning this game.

I think there are some optimal moves for the first several turns, and some overall strategies that are fairly imperative, but beyond that, to win you will need to focus on doing things a little differently from what everyone else is doing. I enjoy the arc of the game also, like many other great games (St. Pete) where you need to eventually cross over from building your engine to a purely point scoring finish.

I learned this as a 3P game.  There are several tracks you need to move up on - and moving up on those tracks gives you more types (colors) of workers that allow you to do other things.  It's an engine builder, with a random draw element that ends with several multiplier points.  It was very fun.

Compelling implementation of the bag building mechanism makes this game shine. Theme complements the mechanism but is fairly thin. Artwork is staid but works nicely given the feudal setting. Game play is very fluid and not terribly demanding. My only real criticism is that set up and take down can be lengthy, preventing the game from seeing more table time.

Játékostáramnak a Burgund, nekem a Vulgari ugrott be elsőnek a játékról. Mindkettő jogosan. A Vulgari a tábla miatt. Itt is kapunk egy térképet, amin tudunk mászkálni, itt terményeket gyűjtünk az utunk során és kereskedőházakat tudunk létrehozni a városokban. A tábla másik része különböző típusú lépegetősáv, amin adott számú lépést megtéve bónuszokat kapunk. Egyrészt általában egy embert, amiket gyűjtve és zsákba tárolva adott számút húzva körönként akciókat hajthatunk végre, másrészt plusz bónuszokat. A játék pakliépítős alapokon nyugszik, ami itt emberépítő, mert munkásaink zsákból húzásával tudunk akciózni a saját kis táblánkon, itt a Burgundos beütés. Egy-egy akcióhoz általában több emberre van szükségünk és lehet a táblánkat akár bővíteni is további akcióhelyekkel. Kapunk még egy kegysávot is, ami a házaink és segítőink számát szorozza meg a játék végén az elért helyünkkel. Illetve van egy piac rész is, ahova már megunt munkásainkat küldhetjük pénzért, tulajdonképpen ez a pakliépítés rész rossz lapok kidobása akciója. Minden körben van még egy esemény is, ami többször negatív mint pozitív. Mi már a szerző által megreformált variánssal játszottunk, ami ezen lapokat egy meghatározott sorrendbe rakja és némi szorzót is ad a játék időben haladása alapján. A játék működik, de sok újat nem mutat és kicsit én teszteletlennek éreztem. Egyrészt nekem a kegysáv erősnek tűnik, másrészt az akcióválasztó rész elvileg szimultán, pedig egyáltalán nem mindegy ki milyen akciókat választ és hogyan hajtja végre. Mintha a Shogunban is nyílt lenne az akcióválasztás rész. Bár végülis a játék során nem éreztünk ebből nagy problémát, azért mindenképp érdekes. Az egyes plusz akciókat adó lapok is eléggé kiegyensúlyozatlanok. Ettől függetlenül játszható a játék és nem utasítanék vissza vele egy következő partit, de nem érzem kiemelkedőnek.

[2017-02-03]
Jó sok idő után ismét előkerült. A szimultán akcióválasztást továbbra is hibának tartom. Muszáj lenne sorban haladni, mert nagyon nem mindegy, hogy az előttem levő milyen akciót vesz el előlem. Ezt egyértelműen a játék hosszának rövidítése miatt rakták be, de sajnos sokat számít. Ebben a játékban alig kerültek elő plusz táblahelyek így ezek kiegyenlítettsége kevésbé jött ki, de mivel választható melyiket vesszük el, így aki előbb rámegy annak előnye van, de ez így rendben is van. Másodikra kicsit jobban bejött, de még nem jött el a pontemelés. Talán majd ha sikerül teljesen hibátlanul játszani. :)

An excellent game made even better with expansions, especially Invasion, which introduces the cooperative variant (and it's challenging!).

It's not my favorite worker placement game but I enjoy it a lot.

Very cool pouch building game. Like Hyperborea, but seems a bit more polished (although the components aren't as good!).

Each player has a bag and some starting worker tiles. Each of the 18 rounds, draw a number of tiles. Everyone simultaneously allocates them on their personal boards, to various actions. In order, activate the actions which have all the required workers. These allow you to recruit additional workers (place in bag), acquire goods tiles, build buildings, increase your tile drawing power, etc. 

There isn't any direct interaction; rather, you're competing with each other for board position and set collection. But it all works very well!

RATING: 8
This is a bag-building pseudo-worker placement euro game.  Each round players take a number of disks depicting different types of workers from a bag and place them on different action spaces requiring different types of workers.  Most of these spaces add new kinds of workers to your bag.  This is very similar to the game Hyperborea but with a much more European theme.

The game is very good.  I really like the bag-building mechanic (I also quite like Hyperborea) and there are many different strategies to follow so gameplay offers a decent amount of variety.  It also maintains a decent helping of luck of the draw to keep the game from being too deterministic or solvable.  Plus it forces you to think in similar terms to any deck builder about the balance between more options and draw efficiency.  There is even a way to "trash" disks from your bag (and get money and potential points from them).

If I had one criticism about the game it would be that it lasts a few too many rounds.  That's not to say that it feels too long.  Many of the phases in this game can be played simultaneously so there is little downtime and even with 4 players it didn't feel too long.  But by the end of the game all the most sought after workers were bought up, most people had maxed out the book track, and ~80% of the deeds track was full.  I would have liked it a little better if it was a little tighter and a little more difficult to drain every last point out of the game by the end.

RATING: N/A
Kudos to the designer for pulling this new mechanism out. A chit pulling system/bag building that is something new for boardgamers. This is obviously, IMO, the biggest compliment I have for Orleans.

On the downside is the lack of strategy in the game. I had the feeling that this could have been much better than what actually felt it is, mainly because it lacked depth and meaning to each action. Getting money is not an economic necessity, it's a VP thing. Moving within the map is not to get different circumstances but to get VP's. Even trashing actions, which works pretty well, gets you VP's.
Everything means VP's and there's nothing really strategic about the actions players are performing. It's mainly tactical.

But in the end, I rather remember the greatness behind this novel mechanism. Great.

Basic game after 2 games. Really great fun. I'm looking for playing morge games. 

Pro
The bag-building mechanism is very good and balanced (Rank 8-9!)
The game needs some rounds to get run, but than it flows ... 
Short moves, little downtime. 
Good proportion between luck (~10%) and strategy (~90%) 

Contra 
I'm missing a scaling for 2 and 3 players for the map and also for the »Good deeds« (right translation?!). With 4 players we had a perfect shortage of cities. With less players the map is to big. 

The optimal actions of the first 3 rounds are too similar depending on the event happens. But I don't know how to manage a beginning, that is more varied. 

It seemed a little repetive on the long run. I think it could stop after 12 rounds as well (if you close some cities on the map and some good deeds) and it won't get worse by that - perhaps better. I'll try it.

I'm really on the fence with this one, I loved AND hated a lot of things about this game.
It goes on 3-4 rounds too many, there's lot of overhead/complexity with little reason, samey/optimal build order, generic european theme, tracks! and it's solitaire.
On the other hand, bag building is interesting, turns are fast and decision are interesting.
I really wish there was a multi-path victory possibility, like Village and the likes. As it stands, it's all relatively scripted and it goes on for so long that you have time to do everything.
I don't think I would ever suggest the game, but I'll gladly play again.

"Bag builder" game where action discs are drawn from a player's bag o' stuff, thus ensuring that perfect planning is impossible and you will never know if the winner managed it by skill or luck. Orleans is pretty clearly an evolution of the designer's earlier Siberia, and the bag-building mechanism seems much less clunky here -- various options for placement grant new discs, extra discs, new places to put them and so on. A map and some tiles provide assorted ways to get VP, represented by goods (which can't be spent) and money (which can't be spent).

It's smooth as butter, but really nothing that we haven't seen before. Good if you want an engine-builder where you can't be sure you'll get the right fuel for it to run.

Really like all aspects of the game except for the buildings. Since all buildings are available from the start it can slow down the flow of the game play when a player shuffles through the whole stack to choose one. This might improve with repeated plays once all players are familiar with them.

A lot of mechanisms are interwoven here into a appealing total.
The "bag-building" reminds of Dominion, although the "weeding out" of weaker discs here is much easier than the scrapping in Dominion.
Throw in some point optimisation. territorial conflicts and some race effects.
Overall, a nice bundle which should also appeal to casual gamers.

I generally like Tasty Minstrel games. This is probably top of the line. So many options, yet the rules are pretty straight forward. It was an easy game to pick up, but the choices in that first game were pretty agonizing--we experienced a smidgen of analysis paralysis. We played with two people. I could see this getting to be a really long game with more.

RATING: 9
A fantastic engine builder with some route building via the map. Although this has worker placement which I normally find frustrating, as you don't compete for spaces but instead each player has an activation board this removes the frustration of turn order (although it is still important). The game initially looks complicated, but it is really easy to teach and play, and once everyone understands the symbols, flows well. Very little downtime as well as most of the phases are taken simultaneously.

Fun game with an interesting premise and fairly unique mechanism. My biggest problem is two fold. One, the game seems a bit scripted and lacks a lot of replayability (since all the buildings come out and there isn't much randomness that mixes it up). The randomness that is there with the events can be overly swingy -- such as early plagues giving one person a huge advantage over the others with other people having no real way to catch up or "attack" them to balance it. And second, it feels a bit too much like a point salad. I wish there was more to do with the money and other resources other than them just being worth a certain amount of points. Besides that I enjoy it especially considering how fast it is.

Tom Vassel Trade and Intrigue is essential, but only for the Trade part.

Dominant strategies, at least for the first few games, make the game more bland than it feels like it should be.  Fun mechanics, but it feels like many of your turns are relatively obvious what to go for.  The events are pretty lame.

Orleans has been hailed as the first "bag-building" game - a mix of Dominion's deck-building (applied to types of workers) and a somewhat finicky worker placement system. Players can send their workers to do various tasks like hire even more workers, gather money and resources, open buildings that provide new action spaces, implement technologies (which are not very different from gaining extra workers), accumulate culture points, and move on a map to build trading posts. It's a good system, there's a good balance between planning out what workers you need to hire, keep, and send away (and in what order), and the uncertainty introduced by the fact that all of these workers are pulled randomly from your bag. The worker placement phase is semi-simultaneous, so downtime is minimized nicely, and there's a lot of different ways to get points (although generally you will go through all of them). 

My main criticism of Orleans is that it attempts to present a wide variety of systems, but instead of tying them together in a coherent way, almost all the elements (except for the workers themselves) don't really do anything during the game. For example: You can get coins from various places. What can you do with your coins? Can you spend them to buy things, to open new buildings or to hire better workers? Well not really, they are just worth points in the end. Another example: There are five kinds of goods that you can pick up as you explore the map, or are given by certain actions. What can you do with the goods? Can you sell them, convert them, trade them? Well not really, they are just worth points at the end. And another example: There's a map where you and your opponents can race around, building trading posts along the way. What do the trading posts do? Do they produce resources, or are you trying to make a connected network? Well, not really, they are just worth points at the end. 

My second criticism is that Orleans doesn't really have enough variability to shake up the game between plays. I really enjoyed my first learning game. Then I enjoyed my second game, where (now understanding the game system), I mapped out the most efficient build order of workers, upgrades and buildings. Then in my third game... it was about the same. The early game puzzle doesn't change at all. The late game puzzle doesn't change unless an opponent grabs a building you wanted (but since buildings are plentiful, you can just get your next choice, no big deal). That's about the extent of your interaction with your opponent; there's nothing impactful to fight over, no precarious plans to concoct or disrupt, no undercutting, no broken dreams. It's all just a steady accumulation of points, and it feels the same every time.

I'd compare Orleans to Concordia, a similar looking game that has a similar amount of systems and complexity. Similar to Orleans, Concordia has its own twist on deckbuilding + action selection. It also has coins and goods and a map, and purchasable special cards, and somewhat complex scoring. In Concordia however, all the systems tie together - each system's outputs feeds into the other systems. Coins and goods are a means to an end, and are in constant flux throughout the game. The variable map setup can meaningfully affect decisions throughout the game, and competition over desirable building spots is significant. Even though Concordia has a shorter rulebook, it makes Orleans look like a half-baked also-ran. 

Orleans is a nice game to play 3-5 times, don't get me wrong. The bag-building mechanic is nice. But I'd recommend getting those plays on a cafe copy, because I don't see this game having a long-term place in my collection.

While I like the bag mechanic, I find the game unexciting and a bit slow paced. Also seems to be some major luck elements; especially when a plague frees up a token for a previously all used color. Willing to give it a few more plays.
Component quality is disappointing; drawing the little thin tokens from the bag just doesn't have much of a tactile quality to it, and its easy to "lose" a counter in the edge of a big bag.

Half a game. 

Feels unfinished, and I'm not prepared to pull out for the expansion to see if it improves the game. Seems they came up with the "bag building" gimmick, then slapped on very average game mechanics around it to make a game.

So many parts feel tacked on, you can just tell the "bag mechanic" came first and everything else was an after thought. Like the travelling board, talk about tacked on.

Overall, very average euro with very standard mechanics. I doubt Orleans would have ever been given much attention if not for the "bag building". Shame the rest of the game  sucks.

Quite an interesting puzzle. I love the duality of the actions - you get an action, but you also get a new worker for your bag. Do you really want another craftsman in your pool? If you go for a few buildings, will all the craftsmen be gone? Then there's the fight on the map - you don't want to get cornered, or you'll see all the vacant slots grabbed before you're able to move there. Yeah, lots to think about here. Very good game.

So far, [company=10848][/company] has been putting out a steady stream of family friendly strategy games. They all play well, have a nice mix of strategy and luck and fail to really stand out in the crowd. 
Orleans still isn't a heavy complex game, but it does have more depth than dlp's previous efforts so it's closer to my taste.
It combines bag building, worker placement and a number of other familiar mechanisms in a very organic way. Turns move fast and you're always doing stuff. There is very little downtime.
It also seems like there are multiple strategies to be explored.
If I have one nitpick it would be that while the game didn't take too long, it did feel like it had 1 or 2 rounds to many and it did start feeling slightly repetitive.
I quite liked it and I hope to play again soon.

Jó kis "bag"-building (a la deckbuilding) játék a szokásos középkori fejlesztős témával. Minden körben a saját zsákunkból húzunk megadott mennyiségű korongot. Ezekkel végrehajtunk akciókat, amelyek vagy győzelmi pontot hozó építkezést adnak vagy újabb korongok vásárlását teszik lehetővé. A megvásárolt korongok az elhasználtakkal együtt visszakerülnek a zsákba és azok közül húzunk a következő kör elején.

Vannak fejlesztési sávok, amivel például meg tudod növelni az egy körben általad húzott korongok számát. És vannak technológia kártyák is, amelyek bővítik az választható akciód számát és persze ezek által mindenkinek más lesz a stratégiája. Még térkép is van a játékban, ahol mászkálunk és a városokba kis házikókat építünk.

Szóval van benne minden jó. Azt mondanám, hogy leginkább nekem a Dominion-ra, egy csipetnyi Hansa Teutonic-ával.

A point-salad, "bag-building" game that feels quite modern and streamlined. It's an enjoyable experience with lots to do on your turn, and yet the game moves along because the planning phase can be completed simultaneously with the other players -- a great innovation that cuts AP. With repeat plays, you'll learn the buildings and different strategies to focus on, which I'm hoping will increase enjoyment and justify my rating.

My worry is that the strategies will become self-evident and even obvious over time -- not necessarily a bad thing unless it's in a way that reduces charm and turns the game into a straightforward optimization exercise. Time will tell.

My first try was as a two-player experience. I'm eager to try it with more to find out if there are additional opportunities to block, or if it's really more of a multi-player solitaire game.

I also must say that I find the artwork, especially the medieval styled illustrations, charming!

Orleans is simple to learn but plays out over eighteen rounds, which means you’re in for the long haul, choosing between acquiring more follower tokens to allow you to make more moves later in the game and moves that over the potential for more points.

I probably shouldn't like Orleans because it's mostly a themeless euro with a side of point salad.  Yet somehow it really clicked with me.  The turns go by very quickly and there is a lot of simultaneous play, yet you still need to pay attention to what you opponents are doing.  I've always been a fan of bag building games, and it works here.  There seems to be a wide variety of strategies, especially because of the unique buildings you can earn.

I think my biggest complaint is that you get to search through the entire stack of buildings.  That means if there are some that are overpowered, you will go for those every time.  I kind of wish it was a "Draw 3, keep 1" situation where you still have a choice, but you're not guaranteed to get the building you want.

But that's a minor complaint.  This is a solid euro, and even though it plays kind of similarly to a Feld game (my least favorite designer), I enjoyed it.

Orleans somehow manages to feel like a midweight to heavy euro but with the speed and ease of play of a much lighter game. It combines well euro mechanisms with deckbuilding. With the Trade and Intrigue expansion, culling (part of the fun and strategy of deckbuilding) plays an even more pivotal role.

I find it completely engrossing. It is tight, complex yet simple, and innovative. I'm constantly checking to see how many rounds are left, feeling as though I can't quite achieve everything I want to, but always managing to make something satisfying. And, checking also, because I don't want the experience to end.

Many 'deckbuilders' simply have cards that essentially do what they say, but Orleans gives you a multitude of options. And again, I think that's where it really shines, that it has the multitude of choice of a heavy euro mixed with the fun, fast paced mechanics of a deck builder (though a bag builder technically).

I love exploring different ways to build my engine (bag), trying different combinations of probabilities and how efficiently I can make each turn work for me. A marvellous game that will always have a place in my collection.

I like a lot of the concepts, complexity and many player options in Orleans. But for a long, deep game, the chit-pull system just adds too much luck to the game. Yes, there are was to mitigate luck a little, but if there's any possible combo of draws from the bag that will leave me with no possible action, I'll draw it. And while everyone else draws their start tiles and suffers no penalty during the famine (or whatever the disaster is that makes you randomly draw and possibly discard a token), I'll inevitably loose the wild token I spent the whole previous turn getting. Still an interesting game, but those random luck swings will keep this from rising beyond "just OK" in my book.

This is cube-pushing at its very best.  Despite the exquisite artwork, Orléans evokes only the tiniest hint of theme in its gameplay.  The events are bland and repetitive.

"Bag building" game with a lot of things going on (i. e. a lot of possibilities for your turn). Not sure whether the game follows a predefined path once you know all buildings well, like Dominion when you know a tableau well. The only interaction is via turn order when you compete for limited ressources or items, e. g. when building guild houses.

RATING: 7.5
A very well designed game that reminds me of a cross between Hyperborea (at a micro level) and Terra Mystica (at a macro level).

There are some aspects of the game that especially impressed me: 1) the graphic design is pretty much second to none (right up there with Eclipse), making the game extremely easy to learn and follow; 2) the game plays surprisingly quickly, thanks in large part to the simultaneous planning phase; 3) it seems very well-balanced in that you could try various strategies and not worry that you're not doing that ONE THING you need to focus on to win.

There is, however, one issue I have with the game that makes my preference lean slightly more towards Hyperborea: Orléans could desperately use an injection of player interaction.  The various tracks and the half-assed area control just aren't enough.  Orléans may very well be the better design, but Hyperborea is more fun to play.

RATING: 7.5
Having played all three of the nominated games for the Kennerspiel des Jahres Award'15, I get the impression the jury has an agenda. Otherwise it's hard to believe Broom Service won over this one and Elysium.

This is a very fast-paced enjoyable game.Place workers, build up your deck/bag with more workers and then later retire these workers to improve your chances of drawing other workers which are getting more important during later parts of the game, collect goods, build trade posts... Nice part about thinning out your deck/bag is that you'll get rewarded for doing so. Like sending priests to the temple in Terra Mystica these "out of the game"-workers block spots other players' workers can't retire to and give you different advantages.Lots of viable strategies to pursue!
There's just a really minor criticism I could make. If you have a game that encourages a simultaneous action selection phase, why don't you include player screens (graphically fitting)? Maybe they're outdated, but I'd have appreciated a set.

I own the deluxe version, my thoughts on the overall game:

It's excellent. The bag-building works really well and there are multiple paths you can take that all seem viable.

The game is very low on interaction/conflict. That's fine for me and most of the people I play with (and even preferred by some), but I know some people prefer more interaction.

The deluxe components are really nice and I haven't experienced some of the issues that some people on the forums have voiced. My wooden discs are uniform (or at least they're not different enough to be easily noticeable). The metal coins are really nice and the wooden bits are nice to have.

Really liking this one so far.

Update: Now that the Trade & Intrigue expansion is out I consider it essential. The base game has a couple of issues and this expansion basically just acknowledges and corrects those issues.

I really like this game. I have a few minor problems with it (Why is there no way to mark which people are "locked in"? Why are the player start people marked in such an obtrusive way? Maybe drags a bit at the end - could be 3 rounds shorter if the Town Hall board was smaller.) but overall I think it's a super-fun very-thinky-but-still-very-breezy game that I don't think many other games can match. I always get screwed by monks not coming up in my bag... but I'm sure there's a way to improve my strategy.

When I first saw Orleans, I avoided it because it was intimidating with so many pieces. Man, was I wrong. It has to be one of my favorite games of all time. 

The gameplay is simple: perform an action then take a tile or move. The bag-building mechanic is so unique because you determine your odds when you add/remove tiles. There is no single way to victory which adds diversity to the game. It makes you think what you can do better afterwards which is a sign of a good game. 

The combination of an euro, worker placement, deck building and luck all hits my wheelhouse. Highly recommended!

This is what is called a "Bag Builder" game. You start with four workers (who you can never lose) and through the game you acquire more workers which go into your bag. Every turn you draw workers, then place them on your player board. After everyone has placed, players take turns triggering actions. Actions can only be triggered for locations where all the appropriate workers have been placed. Actions that aren't completely filled won't trigger, but the workers can remain there until the action is triggered. After workers are triggered they return to your bag.

In addition to your personal player board, there's a communal map with many roads and waterways, all of which have a random assortment of goods on them. There's a set victory point value for the goods in the game, some are just better than others. Additionally, there are cities sprinkled about the board where players can build "guildhalls". The goods and guildhalls aren't used for anything during the game (mostly) and are only a way to generate points at the end of the game.

The actions you can trigger on your board are divided into a couple of different types. About half the actions give you a new worker and then something else. One action is related to purging workers, which gets you some reward. And the rest are related to the map. I don't remember the actual names of the locations, so I'll just describe what they do.

Get a Farmer - Gives you a new farmer and moves you up the farm track (which gives you better and better goods the more you progress)

Get a Sailor/Mechanic/Trader - Gives you a new work of the appropriate type and moves you up the matching track... the sailor track give you money, the mechanic gives you an automation tile which you can place to permanently obviate the need for a worker at a location and the Trader gives you a building which either gives you a power or is a new action spot that does something.

Get a Scholar - Gives you a scholar and moves you up the scholar track which gives you books. Books move you up on the development track which can be a way to get a lot of points. (At game end you'll score according to which development level you achieved by summing your citizen tokens and guildhalls and multiplying the total by your development level)

Get a Knight - Gives you a knight and moves you up the knight track which lets you draw more workers from your bag.

Get a Monk - Gets you a monk, which is a wild worker, but does nothing else.

Get a Book - Doesn't get you any worker, but gives you a book.

Purge - There's a third board in the game where you're building something? A church maybe? You can send up to two workers per turn to help build it. They are permanently committed to those spaces. The building project is divided into many different areas. Each gives a different reward (usually money, sometimes books) and there's a special reward (a citizen token) if you finish any particular area. The spots are keyed to certain worker types, so there might be a race to fill in certain spots before they disappear.

Travel by Wagon - Lets you move your meeple on the map and pick up one good that was on the path you took.

Travel by Ship - Lets you move your meeple on the map and pick up one good that was on the waterway you took.

Build a Guildhall - You can put your guildhall in the city you're in, assuming no one already has.

There are 18 random events (3 each of 6 types) and one will happen at the beginning of each turn. They mostly dock you for money, goods, or workers although some give you points or prevent you from hiring a monk.


The main challenge of the game is figuring out to effectively get and use your workers. Figuring out how to get points effectively is important. Automation is really useful as it makes it easier for you to trigger those actions. Getting buildings that help you or create points is important. You'll often have to make do with the workers you drew, so figuring out how to use what you've drawn can be a challenge. You're limited to having 8 workers in working memory, which doesn't count the ones assigned to locations in previous rounds, so you've got to juggle how many workers you'll use this turn, how many you'll draw next turn, how many you can keep unassigned and how many you need to commit to a location. So you might want to stay flexible and keep a few workers unassigned so that they can see what you draw next turn before committing them to some action... but if can draw a lot of workers then keeping some unassigned means you can't draw as many. But if you assign them to an action and then can't finish that action next turn (if you don't draw the right type of workers for example), you've tied yourself up a bit. And as you might be racing to pick up some good first, or take a particular spot while building the church, a delay might screw you. There are also citizen tokens tied to certain tracks, so not being able to claim an advance on a track can mean you lose out on that race as well.

There's a lot to think about in this game. It's often a challenge to balance taking the actions you want and how that changes the distribution of workers in your bag. Balancing how many workers you have in your bag and how many workers you pull in a round can be tricky too. Taking one action a lot will often mean you end up with a bag that's mostly one type of worker (which is generally bad). Taking a lot of workers into your makes it harder to pull all your workers and can make drawing the worker you need harder. You'll need to plan carefully to fare well in this game.

About [thing=164928][/thing]:

[b]1) What is it?[/b]
[thing=164928][/thing] is a pool building game, in the vein of [thing=36218][/thing] and [thing=91536][/thing], blended with worker placement. In it, you hire workers, that are represented by tokens, and the tokens go into your bag. In the next round, you will take a certain number of workers out of the bag and these will be available for use in that round - and you will use them mostly in your personal board, but they, by the use of the City Hall space on the personal board, can be sent to work in big issues involving the city of Orléans (they stay there - is basically the "trash" option).

With the workers (knights, craftsmen, farmers, monks, scholars, etc) you can help the city of Orléans, travel the country by land or river, build trade posts, acquire tools, adavance in science, and several other things.

[thing=164928][/thing] offers a nice experience, with many paths to follow, and all with a not big learning curve.

[b]2) How do you play?[/b]
Every round starts with the players pulling workers from the bag - at the start the number drawn is 4, but this can be increased by hiring Knights. Players allocate their workers, simultaneously, in spots in their own personal boards. There they might activate actions (hiring other workers, travel or building). The activation of actions is done one at a time, in clockwise order. This is important, as timming to do actions can be very important, since several spots on the country only have one good, which is taken by the first travelling there; citizens, that help the end game score, are taken by the first player to reach a certain spot or fill a task required by the city.

Workers can be left in the board from one round to the other, but there is a maximum space for 8  workers in the market (your available workers). Workers can also be left in a spot on the board, awaiting there to complete the action, but they can't be moved elsewhere.

The goal is to have the most points in the end - coins are points, goods are points and also there is a multiplication that is based in the number trading posts, citizens and level in the science track.

[b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b]
There are several, but most not all that hard to be made. Which worker to hire (in two levels: for the immediate gain and, later, for what it can do); which building to take; where to add a tool (tools are tokens that cover spaces on the personal board, meaning that the worker under to tool is no longer needed in order to do the action); which path to travel; when to use the City Hall (not only to get rid of a unwanted worker, but also to gain coins or science, and the chance of getting a ciziten).

[thing=164928][/thing] mix long term strategy with tatical decisions all the time. You hire workers thinking in the now and/or for the future, then, at the start of the round, you draw randomly from the bag and must do the best you can with what you got. Tools and buildings are all in the strategy camp, and you won't be able to use them in the moment you acquire them, but they can make lots of difference later.

There is also a strong timming issue in the decision-making process. Some actions are better when you have the turn order on your side, doing something before someone else. And you can even set up this - you know that, next round, you will act before X player, therefore, you can delay something, or start something (like helping the city of Orléans) to finish it in the next round.

[b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b]
- Smooth gameplay;
- Small downtime;
- Constant sense of advancement;
- Due to the way scoring works, with goods being hidden, and no one really counting coins, the decision of the game can be a tense moment, in order to discover the winner;
- Strategy mixed with tatic;
- Very good graphic design and art;
- Lots of decisions to be made throughout the game;
- Many paths to victory.

[b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b]
- Luck has its part in the game, mostly in the draw of workers from the bag, but also from the events, but there is ways to decrease the the random chance of the former and knowledge helps deal with the latter;
- The game should have player screens, like the ones in [thing=97207][/thing], as players allocate, at the same time, the workers (you can draw then in the open, just the selection should be done in secret). Doing in player order would just make for some huge and unnecessary downtime, and if doing at the same time, you or someone else can stall, in order to see what everyone is doing, or change, after you see someone, that will act first in the round, doing an action first, which will make yours moot or, at least, weaker. Player screens will solve all of this, so I recommend even DIY some.

[b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b]
Like a successful person. Regardless of the path you choose to follow in the game, you will have some degree of success.

[thing=164928][/thing] provides a great sense of advancement, much greater than other deck/pool builders, since you don't just acquire a worker when you do this (like purchasing a card or a die), but you also gain a something immediately: hire a fisherman and you gain money; hire a knight and your "hand" of workers increase; hire a noble and you gain an unique building to use; hire a craftsman  and you gain a tool; and so on. Even when you travel, you gain a good along the way (if there is still any in the path). This works very well in passing a sense of accomplishment even if you are doing poorly, as you keep gaining things. 

Although punishing games can be really fun, it can be eerily like life, and can be nice to have unbirthday gifts coming almost every round.

[thing=164928][/thing] has a very nice design, offering multiple choices and allowing the players to pick their own path. With the simultaneous allocation of workers and the single action per turn, the downtime is minimal (there can still be some, though, if you are only doing one action, and the others are doing 3, 4, howeber, this doesn't happen often). There is a learning curve in the game, specially considering the timming of hiring, travelling and in knowing the events, but even someone playing for the first time, if the person has some prior experience with deck/pool building and work placement, will have a good chance of playing well. And once one learns it, it won't be required to, later, learn new cards, dice, effects and whatnot, which is usual for other deck/pool building games.

The time of playing is properly laid out: around 90 minutes if playing with 4, somewhat less with 3.

The graphic design works well, being easy to know what things do with a glance, and the game is language independant.

Overall, [thing=164928][/thing] goes well recommended.

Have it Kickstarted - 

Played the french? version and the game is so language independant I would have just bought that instead of waiting months n months for the kickstarter

Played a game - learned it within a round.  Was a lot of fun w/ 3 but I really thing the game will change drastically with 4 and become a lot tighter.  Many things to do and easy to pick up. Also great there is not much down time since everyone is kind of choosing simultaneously.

Look forward to more plays - overall am very glad I picked it up.....but why does it come with bags I could actually live in?  A weird complaint but they are a bit too big, though made nice enough.

You can't afford to ignore much in this game, from money to traveling to running up the scholar track, to building, to getting more workers.  Good citizens are hard to come by, but you'll need at least two.  A winning score is in the low hundreds, the also rans are in the 90's.  No in game scoring, but by the final round you ought to have a good feel for where you stand in the game.  A tough balancing act, very thinky.  If you're one of those gamers always crying about lack of interaction, stay away from this.  There isn't any.

RATING: 5
Not a fan. The options on the board are the usual, uninspired, worker placement/point salad fare. And most of the options that you have, have a racing aspect to them: they are only available to the player reaching them first, or they eventually run out for practically the rest of the game. The problem with the latter is that you can be so unlucky at what you pull out of the bag at te start, that you suffer for it the rest of the game. It also means that it is easy for the rich to become richer and the poor to become poorer, even leading up to players having twice as many options as others each turn. Allright for a short game, but not for a game of this length. Finally, I really do not like pulling thin cardboard counters out of a bag each turn - should have been cubes or something like that.

Let me come out and say that Orleans is a fun game. Folks that played the game all had fun. The game is quick, actions are relatively rapid and the game does not drag: In fact, the 18 rounds for each game while sounds intimidating, is actually a non-issue. That said, I remain slightly disappointed at the game after several plays. 

At the heart of my disappointment is the lack of alternate paths to victory. I am convinced that progressing on the development track and building trading posts just cannot be ignored completely in pursuit of other scoring options. Scoring from other sources just can't reach the same level of points as the trading post/dev track combo. Collecting goods alone is not sufficient to move ahead on the score.  Further, the event tiles also negatively hammer folks that focus on collecting goods by designating 3 types of tiles that impact goods collection whilst helping out folks that build the trading post and advancing on the development tracks. This can be remedied to a certain degree with the proper place tiles to expand the bonuses from goods collection. But there just aren't that many place tiles in the core set that encourages specialization for goods collection (those generating extra goods don't count).  Ultimately, this means the player that best balances all their scoring options will win the game.... certainly not the specialization to victory I was hoping to see.

All that adds up to a game that is good but could really be better. I can't help but feel that with a few tweaks, other paths can developed to compete with trading post/dev track option.

Nice twist to worker-placement/deckbuilding (chitpulling, actually). 
The theme makes not much sense though, because it could be differently colored cubes on a fully abstract board instead of chits with pictures of people. The characters don't matter, only the colors do. Points are gained here and there, added up in the end. And then there's a winner.
After the game there are no memories of certain moments in the game because there's no story behind it. For instance after a play of Agricola there's a sense of having built a farm with lots of animals and there are moments of the game you can remember because they were pivotal, in Orleans you have achieved nothing particular, except you've optimized all resources to the best of your knowledge.

Played once, will play again when offered with the same pleasant company.

This is probably my Favorite New to Me in 2014 Game.

Really enjoy the "Bag-Building" element to this game.  I have tried a new approach each time I've played the game so far, and find that the game can be approached in numerous ways that make it open up more and more each time.  

There is a lot of control over a players bag, and figuring out how to manipulate the bag for my ultimate advantage is a fun and clever part of the game.  

There is enough interaction between players choices to have tense moments that are interesting, and yet enough solitaire to have game play happen very quickly.  A very fine balance between the two.

This game has no theme at all...but it doesn't even matter!  The mechanisms here flow together so seamlessly and are so much fun that, honestly, a strong theme would almost get in the way.  It always feels like you always have a good option even if you can't do exactly what you want on your turn.  In fact, my wife called this one a "point circus" rather than a "point salad" because it was so much fun.

UPGRADED to 7.5 after three plays. We experimented to see whether the only strategy was getting more money and then dropping guys into the town hall in the late game. We tied with me travelling and Jon using the hospital. It reminds me of Castles of Burgundy in *feel*.

Based on two plays. Yet another another moderately-interesting point-salad euro with an innovative mechanic. Perfectly pleasant, in no hurry to have it leave the house, but happy to get rid of it to buy something more interesting. A solid 7.

Not the best game of 2014 and nowwhere as good or innovative as Hyperborea, which has a similar bag-building mechanic but a better game attached to it.

Sufficiently multi-player solitaire that I got bored between turns. Too much fiddling on individual player boards, especially when you're drawing 7 tiles a turn. Players with short attention spans or flu can expect to check their iPad/phone or catch up on sleep in a two-player game, even though there is limited downtime. You can basically do your whole turn without affecting anyone else, but you've still got to wait for them. Grrrr.

Orleans is a riff on deck-building, but instead of using decks of cards, it uses a chit pull system folks are calling bag-building. The game is incredibly easy to both teach and understand. You simply pull a set number of chits and match them to a space which usually allows you to collect another chit to add to your bag. Eventually certain combinations of chits begin feeding actions that gather victory points.

Is this easy? Yes. At first it seemed almost too easy to be interesting. What I did not anticipate, was the subtle difference between drawing chits from a bag and running through a deck of cards. In a traditional deck-builder, you know that you eventually see all the cards in your deck and you can plan accordingly. In bag-building world of Orleans though, after every turn your used pieces go back into the bag. What this means is that it is entirely possible to see the same pieces every single turn or alternatively, to never draw the same piece twice. Either of which can be maddening as you try to plan and execute big turns, or even timely ones for that matter.

In other words, Orleans is simple but it's not easy. That fine distinction makes it a very nice addition to any collection. Games you can teach in five minutes that stay interesting after a couple of plays are a pretty rare commodity after all. There are a few predetermined paths through the game, but if you find players relying on them, the game does provide a nice variant for changing the available buildings, which works even better if you pick up the promos from the geek store.

We accidentally played the game wrong, and it seems it was better for it. You're supposed to do your actions one action at a time in player order. we just did them all at once, mostly simultaneously. It seems to me the game got at least an hour shorter because of that, and it would be too long for what it is and how much luck is in it the official way.
Anyway, the game feels good to play, but there are some things that don't really click for me. Compared to Hyperborea another bagbuilding game, here you don't really have to count what's left in your bag, but on the other hand there is no guarantee to draw everything that's in your bag, because you will immediately put back used tokens in the bag. This creates and additional luck factor too.
I don't really feel like the events add anything to the game, other than more luck factor via the Plague.
The travelling, building houses and collecting goods part is also meaningless. It feels the designer came up with the bagbuilding part, and struggled to add a game to it.
The town hall is weird. I really like the idea of getting rid of your tokens for points, but getting a huge bonus for finishing a set is nothing more than oppurtunity for accidental kingmaking. I didn't really watch out for that, accidentally giving someone 12 points. I guess it's supposed to add interaction to a pretty solitaire game but ... come on. There are better ways for that.

Enjoyable euro game with a unique bag-building mechanics. The rules are rather simple, but playing this game effectively and efficiently is by no means easy. It will take a while to fully unlock the potential of Orleans and learn the intricacies of the interplay between various tiles and actions. I do have some concerns regarding the long-term replayability of the game due to the static setup of the building tiles, but hopefully the expansions will help with that. So far so good.

The downside I've found is that certain moves and strategies seem like no-brainers while others (including some building tiles) are rather useless (or at least I don't think I would ever buy them). Also, the Town Hall board doesn't scale at all so that it's very difficult grab Citizens that way in a 2-player game. But although some parts of this design feel rather unpolished, I still enjoy the game, it's a lot of fun. I wish it had more player interaction though.

/update: I wish I hadn't sold the base game as Trade & Intrigue expansion seems to fix every issue I had with it. I will have to check it out someday.

Deck building with workers - neat. Seems like there are lots of ways to win points but basically there are three and after one game it seems like you must collect all three if you are to have any chance of winning. Quite a frustrating game because although your bag may be full of good things they don't necessarily come out when you need them (dice hate me syndrome). Also there often seems little choice on how to use the characters you have if you are going to optimise their use. Must be me though cos it seems like a popular game.

Introduces a new genre - the "bag builder."

Rounds play quickly but it seems there are a few too many of them.

Also, components are sub par.

Hopefully, someone will put out a nicer, less expensive version of this one.

[EDIT]raising from 6.5 to 7. I played it again and liked it more. It's a point salad and we ended in a very few points.
I must add two things I still don't like. Sometimes there is too much luck that is especially negative at the beginning of the game: losing a disc early on can be crippling.
Second: setup is terribly long. This is one of those games that can be much better on the internet.


---------------------
It's not a bad game but it doesnt shine with originality (ooohh, yes, the bag building... in 2014 it's not that original you know), it's tad complicated during explanation, it's a bit lacking on the interaction side (not that i really need it) but most of all it's not extremely exciting. There are absolutely good things, the most important one is you can follow different paths buy actually building your bag in different ways and concentrating on a few of the different characters.
Once again, not a bad game, but it doesnt shine and doesnt make me want to play it again soon.

going to have a hard time not comparing this to Hyperborea. Both games feature a bag-building mechanic where you’re acquiring cubes or discs and putting them into a bag, “shuffling” the bag, and then drawing a certain number of cubes or discs. Using those cubes or discs, you then take actions depending on the color. In both games, you can leave those cubes or discs on the board between rounds in order to leave them out of the bag and as a way of making it easier to take an action later. The biggest difference is that you have to purposefully reset in Hyperborea and you just take the discs from used actions in Orléans.

So, what’s my take on Orléans? Well, I think it’s the better game. Here’s why it’s better:

More fluid, faster game
Better art, though I prefer Hyperborea’s theme.
Fantastic components
Faster setup (though, not by a ton)
Really though, after playing a very long “short game” of Hyperborea last night, the play length is probably the thing that most appeals to me. Now, I do enjoy long games, but my patience for overly long games is running very thin lately. I don’t get to play games as much as I’d like and wasting time on a game that feels like it should be over faster is a cardinal sin in my book. Orléans really does feel like it moves quicker and with more interesting decisions and less analysis paralysis.

This makes it sound like play length is everything, but it’s not. Orléans is a fantastic game in it’s own right. It takes what made deck building games interesting and removed the cards without adding too many more mechanics. The theme—medieval life—is overdone, but I’m okay with it considering how well it’s drawn thanks to Klemens Franz.

Out of all of the new euro games I’ve played recently, this has been one of the best.

Highly recommended.

Only played it once so far but I thoroughly enjoyed it. It was lighter than I expected it to be. Going to play it again soon and will rate it after I've had a chance to delve into the strategy a little deeper.

Edit: one year later. I've played the game about four times now, including a playthrough of the single player variant. While the game is mechanically solid and I can imagine that the art and theme appeal to a lot of folks, unfortunately I have to say that for me Orléans didn't really stand the test of time. The bag building aspect was a neat idea at first, but started to bore me after a couple of plays, especially since each game feels kind of same-ey in the first few rounds.

RATING: N/A
Medieval euro, "pouch builder" worker placement point salad with lots of resource conversion. Standard and special workers are randomly drawn each round from a bag of tokens. In deck builder style players can hire additional workers to add to the bag. Many scoring paths; census track for attracting farmers, progress tracks for the special workers, travel around the region and establish guild houses and trade routes, produce resources, build buildings, and sacrifice worker tokens to community development projects.  It is a sprawling game that needs a lot of table space. So many things I like about this game; limited resources, simultaneous programmed actions, automation concept from using craftsman, the wildcard of the monk, the deck thinning element offered by sending workers to community improvements, dual use of countdown timer tiles that cleverly symbolize passage of and remaining game rounds while causing a bane or boon event. The color coding of the board and pieces makes it visually easy and clear to teach and to plan your actions. One thing I like most is this is one of the few point salad games that offers many paths to score points that can actually lead to victory. Our experience is most games of this category have several scoring options but only one or two ways to win. Aside from limited resources and turn order in placing guilds and trade routes it is not very interactive and could be called multi player solitaire but I really enjoy this game and see this moving up the BGG ranks fast.

RATING: 8
Initial rating, but it may go up. I really liked the deluxe components and the ease of play. Fairly simple to understand the benefit of various placement spots, but there is a great deal of variety in terms of paths to pursue for endgame points.

As some have said, there is randomness in what comes out and what -- possibly -- gets removed from your bag. I was hit by this in the first game somewhat, but I still think it's a necessary element to keep things interesting.

Certain strategies seem apparent after the first play, but I'd certainly enjoy trying again. Fun to optimize your workers or setup bigger plays on subsequent rounds.

Definitely prone to large amounts of AP, especially at five players. That was my main issue, especially when dealing with a stalled engine and others making four or five plays in one turn.

There are a lot of stuff you can do in this game, and a lot of strategies can win you the game. The board is nice, and I like the drawing mechanism. The big downside could be the hugh importance of certain actions at certain times. Luck can also factor in in this regard. However, I still like the game.

Really loving this one and can't wait for the Trade & Intrique expansion. Multiple ways to victory which I love, it feels so similar yet different than other games in my collection :) Have to play it more!

This game felt like it would be really tight/constrained early on and I loved it - it felt like you'd be able to pick from a variety of strategies and be competitive. By the mid-game though, I had built an engine and had the back half of the game to eventually accomplish almost everything. While it was fun to run the engine for awhile and complete everything, the loosening of the "chains" made the decisions far less interesting (you could accomplish it all) and reduced the overall enjoyment of the game.

Maybe I shouldn't rate it a 9 after one play, but it truly is a great game. The bag building mechanic is interesting. I'm a big fan of the map that you're roaming around on.

A few strange negatives: the techs feel a little weird, and I think removing half of them each game is good. Also, during the planning phase, why does everyone go at the same time? Strange. During the early game, this doesn't matter, but it sure does later on. And the suggestion in the rules to do this in turn order is absurd. The game needs shields so you can plan in secret.

I see that I've written plenty more about the negatives than the positives, but the game is truly great, and I can't wait to play it again.

After playing this game once, I already know that I'm going to thoroughly enjoy it. The mechanics of the game are very simple but, because of that, it allows you to focus on figuring out how to optimize you strategy.

Yes... there is luck in what you pull out of the bag, but there are ways to mitigate that. I enjoy the "events" that happen every round as they give you something to worry about without being overly punishing. There are so many paths to victory yet you really need to know when to focus on different things and when to switch gears.

All in all it is a very fun game and one that I'm looking forward to playing again very soon. Given my initial thoughts on the game after one play... I have a feeling that I'll be ranking it fairly high.

Might be as euro as it gets, in that you collect resources and money and some other tiles and everything is worth points at the end. But what makes this game great is the bag-building mechanism. Every player collects different workers during the game that he can place on his tableau to perform actions. This makes the game different for every player and its fun to specialize in a certain direction and see what everybody else is doing.

Solid game mechanics, with planning on what to pursue and how to thin out the workers crucial to the game. The mechanics do not gel very well with the setting of the game though. Player interaction is slightly low. Artwork is functional and easy on the eye. Component quality is very high. Scalability may be suspect, given that the board remains the same for different player counts.

RATING: 7
Excellent bag building game. It looks great, I really like the art. The game is interesting, however it seems that strategy is a bit one dimensional. The multiplier for guild-houses, citizens and star value can reliably outweigh the other elements of scoring making goods collection incidental.

I've had a few too many poor games of Orleans and it's beginning to fade a bit for me. The main issue I have is that it just feels overly familiar - most games seem to play out in a similar way. Although I feel like it's a good game I'm tiring of it before 10 plays which isn't a great sign.

Very few eurogames excite me these days, and while this one was okay for a few plays, its sheen is quickly wearing off. I find the start a bit scripted, between Craftsmen, and Knights being simply more important than the other occupations at start. There really is no theme. You collect money that can very rarely be spent and just equals victory points, there are goods which you gather, but for no reason apart from VP, and this continues.

Orleans is a really nice mix of comfortable mechanics.  Most notably the "bag building" of your worker chips has a feel similar to deck building without being the classic Dominion formula.  In fact you are trying to seed your bad with the right pieces for the set collectionish worker management phase which is the real heart of the game.  This part combined with your ability to improve your action choices is the heart of the game and gives you a big action space to play in with lots of options to score points. Of course the game is also pretty sprawling with lots of inherent fiddliness.  

So all in all an enjoyable game... but for now I don't feel a need to add it to my collection.  Just a bit too much work to set up and explain for what is in the end just another engine building Euro.

Bag building worker (chits really) assignment game that works like dominion without a discard pile. you put workers on a "waiting area" and then can assign to one or multiple spots on your own player mat -- one you satisfy a spots requirements you can take this action which has a reward -- and put these workers back in the bag

I thought it looked like a good game.

very very expensive though.

This is a game with legs. Every time you play, the board changes enough to create new challenges and strategies. Many of the buildings are quite powerful and a force to be reckoned with. The much maligned Bathhouse is no more powerful than the School, Herb Garden, or the Laboratory as powerful cornerstones of various strategies (and that's based on a handful of plays). The end of turn events are never fully destructive but being unprepared will catch players out. Choosing to take a new follower for its bonus action still saddles you with another follower that may be drawn at the beginning of your turn, which can clog up your works. Definitely spring for the wooden upgrades (meeples or cylindrical discs), as it makes drawing pieces much easier (the small discs get lost in the corners of the bag). All in all, this game obviously has legs and will take many, many plays to even begin to master.

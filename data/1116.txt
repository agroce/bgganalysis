Subtle, quick, very balanced, and strategy varies according to how many cards are dealt. Can also be played in long or short duration, or paused and picked up at a later time. Really really nice that it accommodates varying numbers of players 3, 4-7, even more with additional decks of cards.

Great party game (at least I have only played under this conditions)I got to know this game many years ago (under a different name)in a version adapted to work with a regular deck of cards, main differencas are, the number of cards increases, in the adapted version, from 1 to 11 (an improvement) and also it doesn't have the effects cards. It is really funny trying to predict the outcome of the rounds, even when your plans are shot dead.

This is one of my favorite card games for groups of 4-7 players.  I like games where you bid (promise to win a certain number of tricks) and try to make your bid, and this game does it in a nice mellow way that is fun for everyone. 

We play that the total bid CAN equal a number such that everyone can be happy, which nevertheless, still results in people not making their bids the vast majority of the time.

very sturdy casual card game.  i think i'd prefer it with the variant that trump can't be led until broken.  maybe that's a standard rule though, i have no idea.  it's nice that you can accommodate 5-8 players by using suits from a second deck, but i like it best with four.

Classic trumped trick-taking game with some nasty bidding. I am almost supernaturally bad at this game, but it's still a lot of fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
The object is for each player to bid the number of tricks they think they can take from each hand, then to take exactly that many; no more and no fewer. Points are awarded only for making the bid exactly.  At least one player will fail on each hand, because the total number of tricks bid by the players may not equal the number of tricks available on that hand.  a.k.a. Blob.  Excellent game but would choose Wizard in preference.  The same game with an added tweak.

Growing up we played a game that we called diminishing bridge which is essentially the same game. A trick taking game where you try to guess how many tricks you'll take. The great thing about these types of games (like Where's Bob's Hat?) is that you can be consistently dealt terrible hands and still win the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
First, it's much better if the number of tricks bid cannot equal the number of tricks available. Tension is good! Also, here's an alternate scoring system I believe is an improvement over the usual scoring method, in that it that reduces the potency of simply bidding zero as often as possible: (1) Bidding and taking zero tricks is always worth exactly five points, no matter the hand size. (2) Bidding and failing to take any number of tricks subtracts ten times the difference between tricks bid and tricks taken. (3) Bidding and exactly taking any number of tricks greater than zero adds ten times the number of tricks plus the number of tricks squared!

RATING: 7.5
This is my group's most played after dinner party game.  It scales well (I've played from 4-7 people), and there are some meaningful decisions to be made -- but there's enough luck to where newbies won't necessarily get pummeled by experienced hands, so it is easy to introduce to newbies.  It's light enough that you can easily chat socially, but not so light as to be uninteresting.  Try it!

UPDATE:  getting a little tired of the huge role of luck in this, but it is still a fun light game with six people.

I learned this game in college and have enjoyed it every since.  I did learn with unusual scoring though:
for made bids: +10 + n^2
for missed bids: -5(delta)!

So, a made 4 bid would be 10 + 16 = 26
but taking only one trick on your four bid would be -5(3!) = -5(3*2*1) = -30

One hint: don't miss by 4 . . .

One of the reasons I love card games is that they can be played seriously or casually by players in the same game and it doesn't affect the enjoyment for either type of player. Alot of subtle tactics and fun trying to whack the leader. Just pure fun, and adored by non-gamers. I always knew it as Screw Your Neighbor, with the variant that the total numbers of bids can't equal the number of cards dealt.

Estimate how many tricks you will take in a hand. Try to hit your target. Do this for hand sizes of ten cards down to one and back up again.  The tricky bit is the last person to bid isn't allowed to make the total bid match the number of tricks available.

U.G. version Oh Hell: The Red Hot Card Game = 52 regular cards, 2 jokers and 4 bidding wheels (All, 1-12 dial).

This is my all-time favorite.  So many great memories of playing every time my father, brother, sister, and I were together somewhere.  We always played with just a regular deck of playing cards.  Start by dealing 1 card to each player and then turning over the top card of the deck to determine the trump suit.  If an ace is overturned there is no trump that round.  Each player (one at a time) bids how many tricks he will win.  The dealer bids last and can't bid a number that will allow everyone to make his bid that round (at least 1 person must lose each round).  Play the hand out and then in the next hand deal 2 cards to each player, then 3, etc. up to 12 (unless you are playing with more than 4 players then you can't go as high because there are not enough cards).  Once you get to 12 you start back down.  The first to get 100 points is the winner.

My family plays a house version where the stupid bidding wheel is removed and bidding goes around the table from the left of the dealer. Last bidder (dealer) may not bid a number that will make the total number of bid tricks equal to the actual number of dealt tricks (thus forcing at least one player to be set every turn). We play from 10 cards to 1 and 1 card back to 10 again. We also turn over one card from the deck after the deal to determine if there is a trump suit: 6 and higher is trump in the suit of the turned card, 5 and lower is no trump. This version is significantly better than the blind bidding nonsense in the published rules. Closer to a 4 rating with the rules as written. My rating is for the aforementioned variant.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
My parents play a variant of this game which really only simplifies the scoring (if you make your bid, add 10 to it for the hand; otherwise, score nothing).  They call it 'Screw Your Neighbor' and play for a nickel a point (it can get expensive for the player who hits rock bottom).  Despite the gambling edge to it, the game is tremendous fun and I'm actually surprised that a) I found out what it's really called and b) that someone actually sold this commercially.  I do remember, now that I know its true name, learning it in grade school as Oh, Shit!  Of course, back then, the fun of the game was in the name and clearly it didn't stick with me.

Either way, with money or without, the game is hilarious as you really can mess with everyone at the table.  It's always a good time when we get together to play this, but I tend not to do so often because I'm not a big fan of gambling on such wild luck.  The only true skill is figuring out the correct bid and ensuring that nobody else can make theirs.  But alas, you are at the mercy of the shuffle and sometimes you're just hosed.

Good.  My family calls this "Idiot's Delight."  It's a good party game for large groups.  Heavily luck-dependent, but I think the main enjoyment is watching other people's faces as their "sure bid" gets busted again and again.

I love this game.  We always play when we get together as a family.  There is a good reason it is sometimes called "S--- On Your Neighbor".  I wouldn't bother playing with less than five or six people.  It is my favorite trump-taking game although "Rook" comes very close.

This is the family game, but we call it "Ten High".  Our variant includes (a) one player must be set or "go down" each hand, and (b) we start at ten cards and go down to one.  As I said, this is THE family game.  When in doubt, we play it.  We used to keep annual running stats (in an Excel spreadsheet) and then determine a winner at the end of the year.  Often, our games turn loud and can stretch until the next day.

My go-to group game for non-gamers, and favorite standard 52-card deck game. People immediately vibe with the strange nature of this game, in which winning a trick can bad and losing a trick can be great. Figuring out how to bid properly takes some getting used to, but all other facets of the game are very intuitive. The large late game hand sizes help players from getting eliminated too early, but also opens the door to some sneaky king making. My favorite variant is to start at the max hand size, work down to a smaller hands, and then back to the max hand size again (ex. 10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10). Also points are awarded as 2+bid (zero scores two points) in my group, to help keep the bomb-strategy viable.

Another trick-taking card game.  It's not very deep, but it can be a brutal game because you only score if you get EXACTLY your bid (under my preferred scoring method...in other variations, you always score, but get a bonus if you get exactly your bid). This game is pretty random, even for a traditional card, but it's certainly fun.

One of my favorite standard card games.  I like the fact that card counting is de-emphasized due to not using the entire deck.

Possibly the worst named game (anything) in human history. Pity, as it is a really good game. We call it Rikiki. Our point scoring system is:
10 + 2 * tricks taken if contract fulfilled (Bid 4 take 4 = 18 points)
-2 * trick difference if you guessed incorrectly. (Bid 4 take 2 or 6 = -4 points)
A few interesting house rules:
We bid simultaneously using our fingers.
When only one card is dealt, we place it on our foreheads so that everyone bar ourselves can see our card.

I've played once and haven't rated, but it would probably be around a 5. Typical traditional card game, but with having to meet the bid exactly, it's a bit hard and therefore frustrating for the 8 year old (even the 13 year old didn't like that). So, really didn't work well as a family game.

In my world there is a pantheon of trick-taking games. It includes double [thing=354]Sticheln[/thing], [thing=152]Mü[/thing], and Up and Down the River. Sticheln is a bastard’s game, a trick-taker from hell. It’s like dodging boulders in a falling rock zone while line dancing. Mü is a thinking man’s partnership game, a striptease of information that climaxes in a dramatic pairing off of partners and then a ritualized calling of the trumps. After that it’s all about seeing who was lying about the size of their dick.

But Up and Down the River is the essence of trick-taking. To start each round, the players thump the table simultaneously, popping a finger on the third thump. Every popped finger is a trick bid to take. [color=#666666](By convention, the first round starts with 1 trick, then each round’s number of tricks increases by 1 until you hit 8 [5 players], 10 [4 players], or 13 [3 or 2 players].)[/color] Highest bid calls the trump (or just flip for trump) and starts. After that it’s canonical trick-taking rules all the way: Lead what you like, follow suit. Each player scores 1 point for every trick he took. Players who missed their bid are then penalized; players who made their bid score a bonus.

And that’s it.

It’s the simplest trick-taking game known to man.

But it’s a mantlepiece sideshow: trying like mad to lose tricks after you takes ones you didn’t bid on, trying like madder to take tricks after you lost ones you were counting on; tearing your hair in the bid over whether you’ll win the lead and which of two opposing bids you should make based on whether you will.

Up and Down the River is all about playing the odds, about making your bid and then hewing to it when you’re overbid by 3 or underbid by 6. About deciding based on your opponent’s play which lead or follow will better protect your bid. About saving trumps to take back the lead on the right turn, or trying to resist the lead long enough to set up your hand to throw off.

I’ve tried other trick-takers out of a love for trick-taking games, but nothing has ever come close to getting from me the love I have for Up and Down the River. [thing=619]The Bottle Imp[/thing] is a pale shadow of its fight to lose the lead, and The Dwarf King was an embarrassing experiment better forgotten. When I want a trick-taker, my first instinct is to take out Up and Down the River.[color=#ffffff]a9Z4MnAx[/color]

An enjoyable Whist variant with the twist of having to guess how many tricks you'll take. Better to guess low than high as it's easier to deliberately lose than force the win when you need to.

This is Up and down the river.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I played this many times before February 28th, 2008. Taught in 2min for trick taking players, played in an hour for 5 players. (depending on how far up the river you play).  Typically we divide out how many players into 51 cards we can play to. I know this as "Up and down the river". We played up the river to 10 with 5. Goal is high points. The first dealer deals out 1 card to each and turns up one last card to denote trump. You record the trick bid that everyone thinks they will take, starting with dealer's left. We play screw the dealer which means that the dealer must bid a number which makes the total bid different than the number of cards dealt. I.e. in round 1, bid is 1 to dealer, they must also bid 1. Then dealers left leads and you play a trick-taking round. You get 1 point for each trick taken plus a 10 point bonus if you bid matches tricks taken. For the 2nd hand, you deal two cards, up to a certain number of cards, then back down to one card as the final round. I'd highly recommend giving this a gameplay, especially since you can play with a standard deck of cards.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Good with a group, I'd probably use 1 deck for 5 or under, 2 decks for 6-9, avoid playing with 10 or more. 2 high cards that would both with the trick cancel and both lose. This can be applied repeatedly. If the trick is dead (no legal card could win), it goes to the winner of the next trick and the same player leads again. If the last trick in a hand is dead, the last player to win a trick gets it instead.

Dec08: Alright, I suppose I should rate this.  I've only played a couple thousand games of it at lunch.

And actually, I haven't played true "Oh Hell".  We just always deal out the whole deck to make it a more strategic game.

How does it work?  Pretty darn well as a bare bones trick taking game.  It has thought.  It has daring.  And yet it still doesn't hurt your head or take too long.

Also works well at lunch since you can just play hands until time is up.

Better than most public domain trick-taking games. Prefer this over Euchre.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Very Standard trick taking fare but still a fun diversion.  I liken this to Euchre, its a great introductory game but its been surpassed by many much better games. Its still an easy to learn good light fast fun game though that can have some tense moments if your in contention near the end. 

The bidding rule makes the game, that is the dealer often getting hosed by not being able to bid an amount that equals the exact number of tricks, therefore at least one person has to fail each hand. The scoring is well implemented here and for once does not seem to need tweaking. If you are playing the version that goes down to 1 card each and then back up, whoever is the dealer for the "1" hand REALLY gets hosed, that might need a tweak...

UPDATE: 5.5 => 6.5 Whoah hold on a second, this is one of those games that is much better in person! There are also a couple extra points here I should have mentioned that really shone through with more play: 

- You can still win even if you keep getting crappy cards!  This is a HUGE plus, luck plays a very small role here since as long as you make the bid you get 10 points, even if bid is zero! 

- It's fun trying to screw over other people. When you blow your bid because you messed up or someone messed you up, now your mission is to make sure others don't make their bid! This kind of play is very reminiscent of Die Sieben Siegel (which I still think I prefer)

So these 2 points above combined with the good scoring and the rule that at least one person gets screwed all make this a good fun filler game to pull out.

Growing up, we called this game "Ten Down", which is moderately different in that you don't go back up in the number of cards, you just start at 10 and work your way down.  I like the planning involved, and there's a lot of room for a skilled player to maneuver.  We played this so much over the years - it is a versatile, rewarding game.  Most modern variants I've tried (especially Rage) bother me with the amount of chaos involved.

This destroys Spades. Rather than having 13 cards each turn, you go down the ladder and then back up. so you would have 13 the first hand, then only 12 the next, and so on until just 1 card for a turn, and then you go back up. And you can modify the ladder, for instance i like to play 8-1 and then back 1-8. I like the shorter quicker variant the best. And since you only score if you catch your Exact bid, it seems to be a little less stressful at the smaller number hand counts.

This is a very popular game for all ages including my parents and my co-workers.  The version we play during lunch at work is blind-bidding with players concealing poker chips in their hand and then simultaneously dropping them on the table.  We leave the poker chip bids in front of each player as a reminder of how many tricks each player bid.  When you win a trick you place one of your chips on top of the trick.  One of great things about this game is that it is very easy to learn and accommodates 3-8 players easily.

Trick-taking card game where you 'bid' on how many hands you will win per round.  If you hit your bid you score some points, if you don't you lose some points.

Magyarországon Rikiki néven ismert francia kártyával játszott játék. A Wizard őse. A játékosok megjósolják a mindig változó számú lapból mennyit fognak ütni. Sok változata volt. Adu, adunélküli és a pontozás is nagyon eltérő volt néha.

This is a fun trick-taking game. Wizard has better scoring and I like the Jesters a lot; the Wizard cards are too strong and it's frustrating to get hit with them.

RATING: 6
Variant using a standard deck of cards.  Start with 1 card, go up to max and back down.  No bidding restriction.  No deductions for failure, just no positive points.  Successful bid = 10 + number bid.

Trying to hit your bid is a pretty good challenge.  In general I would rather play a partnership trick-taking game.

This game can quickly overstay its welcome if people take too long to think about bids -- played fast and loose, however, it's a lot of fun.

Played the hell out of it in college.  Also, I remember seeing the actual boxed game on the shelf at the old Lucky's supermarket when I was a kid, so maybe subliminally I liked it all along.

[Poker] {Card; trick-taking, bidding; optimal 4p} It is an interesting trick-taking game. It's also one of my favorite card games.  I prefer the square scoring rule.  I wish that I could play it more often with suitable players.

However, it's just a joke to play a hand with fewer than 4 cards.

The version I've played is called "Up and Down" (though that may just be a family name for it) and involves starting at 7 cards, then going down to 1 and back up to 7 (so why isn't it 'Down and Up?')  Beats me!  The dealer may not bid an amount to make the tricks come out even.  Score is 10+bid for making your bid, nothing for taking less than you bid, and 1 point per trick taken for going over your bid.  I think this is a very enjoyable game, but I dislike the bidding restriction on the dealer (dealing the 1 card hand tends to stink!).  In general, however, I would almost always rather play Rage, which is almost exactly the same game but is made more entertaining with the special cards.

Played as Up and Down the River.  Good game for 4+ players.

RATING: 8
This is a nice simple trick taking game that scales very well from 3-6 players.  There's a nice cutthroat element to it as well.  I love that scoring well does NOT correspond to getting dealt good cards.  Often a hand of low cards and no trump is the easiest hand to succeed with.

RATING: 6.5
A classic trick taking game. Each hand, all players bid the number of tricks they will take - make your bid and score bonus points. The catch is that each round the total bid can't equal the number of tricks, thus at least one player will always miss their bid. This can be played with a standard deck of cards, so you don't have to get "Oh Hell!" to play. In fact, you'd be better served getting a copy of Wizard (which is Oh Hell + a couple special cards).

RATING: 6
Fun, but light, exact bidding card game. For more challenge, eschew any hand with less than 5 cards. My favorite variation is to start with 10 cards, go down to 5, and then back up to 10. My favorite aspect of Oh Hell!, however, is that it is so readily adaptable to groups small and large.

For a better game with the same underused but fascinating mechanic, try Ninety-Nine.

The family standard on my wife's side of the family.  Of course we play Oh Shoot.

RATING: 8
Great fun. Simple, standard trick-taking game that has held up well over the years. The only quibble I have is that being the dealer and being forced to make a bad bid early on when few cards are being dealt is frustrating.

RATING: 5
A card game you play with an ordinary deck of cards. My family has been playing this since the late 80's. I do not find it a really good game, but I play along anyway.

RATING: 7
Fun family game using a standard deck of cards and a big box of safety matches. This Danish version of "Oh Hell" is played with simultaneous bidding using matches hidden in the hand and revealed by all players at a count of three. Also, in the Danish version spades are always trumps.

RATING: 7
I like to start with 1 card dealt and go up. I also prefer to score 10 points for each trick you bid if you get your bid (10 points for a bid of zero.) plus 1 point for each trick taken, and if you don't get your bid negative 10 for each trick you're off(again, plus 1 point for each trick won). I like both simultaneous and bidding in turn, depending on my mood. Naturally there is more control when bidding in turn.

RATING: 8
Fun trick taking, social game.  Favorite of my family.  Grew up playing alot of this.  Fun for gatherings as it scales well.  The imperfect information is the engine that drives this fun filler game.

Realizing its a traditional card game, means I should specify my preferential variant.  Zero bids are worth 5 points.  Positive tricks are 10+number.  We go from low to high, back to low.

Provides mix of fun, tension, tactics and luck. As other good card games, it has high replayability, which gives it a timeless quality. Played several variants, with points ("Boeren"="Chinees p***en")or with money ("Voor de frankskes").

RATING: 2
Plays like a primitive variant of Spades, which is by far, the superior game. Very difficult to take the correct bid for your hand. How this deserves the 9's and 10's, is above and beyond any cool headed reasoning. Mindless fun equates to mindless ratings, I'm guessing. Try [gameid=568], [gameid=1465]...or better yet: [gameid=3463].

Fun trick taking game where you need to bid on how many tricks you believe you'll be able to get after seeing trump and your hand. I've had some trouble with finding a scoring method that works well though. There are many different variations. I find it more fun to just play for fun. Most often it comes down to the person who bids correctly the most times anyways.

Played with 3 players.  A great trick-taking alternative to Spades when you only have 3 people.  We most often play this on nights that we don't want to deal with setup/cleanup.

I like this kind of game, where you have to bid on the number of tricks you are going to get in a given round. 
Oh Hell unfortunately includes too many special cards, that mess with your plans in random ways.

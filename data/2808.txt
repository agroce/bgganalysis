Epic game demanding much scrutiny and thought, but tending towards draws.  Both sides have great advantages, but competent play usually sees them cancelled out.  The Germans have their panzers and more mobile troops (except in a bad winter - and winters are rolled for with dice, so you might not get many), the Russians have endless reinforcements, lots of countryside to fall back on and some good defensive positions.

A 40 year old classic that still holds its own with the new kids.  This game balances playability and history.  You get German blitzkrieg/Stukas, Russian waves, encirclements, Russian Winter, Partisans, and much more without a bunch of rules and fiddliness.  Game play is old school and fun all at the same time.  Quite possibly my very favorite hex-and-counter game by Avalon Hill, and that is saying something.

This might well get higher, since I'm very fond of (the Jedko version of) this oldie, but I'm sticking to the BGG descriptors here, and it's a game I'd think hard about committing to, for time reasons.  A fairly big problem was that the game seemed to be tilted towards a good Russian player.

Mine is the Jedko 2nd edition, given to me for my 14th birthday. Many hours spent as a teenager playing this during the 1980s. Whilst not overly complex, TRC conveys the struggle with great historical realism. There are multiple short scenarios, or you can play the entire campaign. Double-impulse movement simulating motorised warfare was a god-send, as were the nuanced OB/reinforcement charts. Simple devices like stukas (air power) and rail movement (logistics) elegantly capture the waxing and waning fortunes of each side over the journey. And it looks great too, the field grey, black and brown counters of respective units adding another layer of realism. 
Like Stalingrad, a real classic and favourite of mine.

Best "gaming" wargame ever! If you played TRC once, you are going to play it again and again. Very playable for an "historical wargame" and while you can't say it's super realistic, it gives A LOT of excitement and flow of the WW2 campaign with only 6 pages of rules. For those who want a real wargame after playing Risk or Axis and Allies (but don't want to learn 64+ pages of rules). Playing time between 2.5 hours (scenarios) and 8 hours for the complete campaign.
Now (2004) it is being published as a 4 Edition en a Deluxe format. PLEASE !!! buy it and try to play it. You won't touch Axis and Allies again !
The Russian Campaign is the best intro to historical board wargaming.

This game has aged well, even with the old counter and hex design.  The key to the game is combined arms and knowing how and when to use them.  This game has the capacity to generate some excitemnt in a fascinating back and forth campaign.  3rd edition counters and board are very bland, but the game itself is very good.

RATING: 7
This is one of my original games from my teen years. It was a core game in my collection as well as my school friends. One of my happiest memories was playing this at a friend's friend 21st party. This guy thought I was a nobody dimwit compared to him and was bragging how he was going to kick my ass as the Russians in 1941. I wiped out every Russian unit in the south by opening AG South centre to a Russian thrust towards Romania. He took the bait while I comprehensively outflanked and crushed the Ukrainian front. I cleaned him off the board in 6 turns and had surrounded his last 6 corps around Moscow with most of mine intact. His Siberian reinforcements got steamrolled attempting a frontal assault on my position. The sight of an entire panzer army of 9 prime divisions massed in the 3 hexes of forest south of Moscow was very warming indeed. When I rolled fine weather for December he immediately capitulated. My friend sniggered to onlookers how this guy was going to have his clock cleaned very quickly when the game began, much to their shock and disbelief. A straight forward simulation that is a lot of fun!

Excellent, middle-weight game of warfare on the Russian Front during WWII. Playable by experienced players in an evening.

I played this recently for the first time - my wargamer friends are sometimes  surprised that as someone who had played these things for upwards of 25 years, I've never played The Russian Campaign - and was of mixed minds. I think it's a very well-designed game - the rules are crisp and clean, and it plays at a good pace and in a reasonable amount of time (although I was amused by the retreat rules, which seemed designed more for PBM than sanity).

But this is a class of wargames that are getting hammered by euros. The themeing on The Russian Campaign is not, in my opinion, that great. Most modern euros like Tigris & Euphrates or Lord of the Rings are more evocative of their subject material than The Russian Campaign, which feels awfully abstract and technical to me now. So TRC loses out on theme, and the much higher-density euros are a more attractive investment in terms of gaming enjoyment. On the other hand, if you move up a small notch in complexity to games like Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage, EastFront, or Rommel in the Desert, you can get the wargame and something that is far more evocative - EastFront in particular is a great game that gives a much better feel for the campaigns. It takes longer to play start to finish, but the individual campaigns (playing, say, June '41 through March '42) are quite rewarding in and of themselves.

So The Russian Campaign, despite being a well-designed game (especially for 1977), finds itself out of a job. A good game, but one that's been eclipsed by euros for gameplay value or slightly higher-end wargames for being viscerally evocative. I respect what it is, but wouldn't have much desire to play again.

RATING: 7
Hasn't done well against the offerings of the past two years and my rating has dropped accordingly.

-----------------

A certifiable classic, it's easy to pick up, gives an excellent flavor of the historical situation, and has the requisite inaccuracies found in older titles.  The game often ends in stalemates, the German players best hope lies in pouring most of his panzers into the Ukraine. Meanwhile, the Soviet player spends the first third of the game on the defense.  

The best way to take a city often entails ending your second impulse's combat phase with stacks of your units still beside the city . . . forcing the defenders to attack you on their turn, with no city terrain bonus.  A bit gamey perhaps?

But the darn thing works, is fun to play as either side, and requires little in the way of a time investment.  Both sides get to be on the offense and defense, albeit with different strengths.

If the scales tilt too far in favor of one side or the other, hey, surrender if you don't feel like playing on.

I think my favorite aspect of the game is the titanic encirclements and back-and-forth battles.  The tenacious Soviet defender that defies the odds, the rapier like counter thrusts of the German force while on the defense.  Heck, even the molasses like advance of the Soviets has its attraction.

It's reasonable priced on eBay, so giving it a try is painless as well.

Look for my turn track / summary players aide here on the Geek.

My all time favorite.  Plays well through the entire campaign ('41 - '45). Tough for both sides.  

Given competent defense (that is, little qualm about trading lives and space for time) the Russian shouldn't lose.  However, even with his hordes of replacements and builds, this doesn't mean that the Reds will easily take Berlin on time.

RATING: 4
Just not impressed, and this game has firmly convinced me that attrition-less ZOC games like this are just silly chess exercises in the long run. Without attrition it's purely about maneuver and force preservation. If successful it has a snowball effect because you can continue to push, having crushed your opponent without taking any losses whatsoever of your own. Combined with the weather rolls, the result is yet another highly brittle game on Barbarossa.

On top of that the AV rules are wonky and the manner in which cities can be taken, by forcing the Russians to attack out due to the mandatory attack rules, are incredibly gamey. The ability to amphibiously invade Rostov in 1941, without even having to take Sevastopol, is quite ridiculous. I'm also not sure why the Russians never get an air force, which makes me wonder how the hell they're ever supposed to drive the Germans back in the long run. There's just way too much suspension of disbelief for me.

I can see why this game would have been popular back in the day. These days I think we can do much better.

This is my second board war game when I was young.  I am still enjoying it.  Rules are easy, while the replacement rules are a good reflection of the speedy recovery of the Soviet force.  The more difficult part is to deal with the weather and the supply - Russian winter is very difficult (obviously I played the German side).

I've owned this game for 3-4 years and finally got to try it out.  This game was simply too much for me.  There are so many counters and they keep coming back due to replacement rules.  Keeping track of which counters have moved & how much each counter can move (based on impulse/type/weather/rail) was a bit overwhelming.  Never mind taking time to devise strategy and get good river placement.  We played the campaign and maybe got a third of the way through before we called it quits...after 5 hours.  And the turns were getting longer due to more chits being put in play.  I can certainly appreciate the genius of this game.  It is amazing for what it offers.  But I can't see how even the most experienced wargamer could finish the game in the advertised 6 hours.   This is a 2 day game (all weekend) for at least the campaign (which is what this game is all about).  In terms of strategy, unless the dice turned or a mistake was made...it looked like were headed for a 18 hour game that ended in stalemate.

The consensus seems to be that this is something of an immortal classic, but I can't see it that way.  For one thing, it's low on historicity -- in particular, locking ZoCs mean there's no blitzkrieg in 1941 if the Soviet player has a clue.  To be fair, my opinion is based on nothing more than a couple of solo plays.  Perhaps it'll grow on me; but I'm putting it away for now.

Update: sold.

2015-08-10 : Back in my mostly-solo wargame days there were 2 games I had made print & play copies of original games owned by Phil. The first was Third Reich, the other was The Russian Campaign.

The aforementioned wargame shop in Sint-Niklaas stocked AH General mags and I bought every issue that contained an article about either game, but if I had to pick a single favorite it would be this one.

The game sure had problems : a streak of good weather early on would end the game for the Russians and river lines with the 'C'ontact rule were impossible to defend, but the game made sense, it had multiple avenues to victory (though "go south" worked best) and moved along at a nice clip.

I've long since acquired a real copy of the game, but I've kept my original P&P around for old time's sake. And now that I'm older I actually prefer my P&P version with the bigger counters 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

I would rank this game as one of the top 10 board wargames ever published. It is relatively easy to learn, as a simulation is it way above average, and as a gaming experience it is just wonderful. I remember quite vividly the first game I played and I was the Soviet player - circa 1975. the panic that the Russians felt with the German onslaught is IN THE GAME, no rules to force it, no cards to make it happen, it's just right there in the system. I am very pleased that the game is coming back into print and I'll probably buy it, which will be the third time I've bought the game. If you like wargames, check it out! (The only reason I don't give it a 10 is that the art is not that great.)

RATING: 7
Even after so many years and so many strategic Eastern Front games, players still keep coming back to this Classic.  While primarily emphasizing the GAME in WAR GAME, there's enough simulation and minimal chrome to provide a solid "feel" for the grand sweep of Eastern Front combat action and recreate the kinds of asymmetrical offensive styles that enable the Germans and Soviets to prevail against each other.  This title is a benchmark in WW II Russian Front wargaming and will continue to be a competitive favorite for quite some time to come.

This game is a good game for beginners.  The rules are relatively clear and simple.  I have found that both sides are pretty much even, making playability very good. I have seen lopsided victories for both sides, but most of the time the games were close.  The game is played on a board and not on a paper map, which should make the game last for a longer time.

It works; panzers against numbers. Nail-biter until the German realizes he can't win (unless he got off to a REAL good start). Good for four players as well as two. There have been games since which are more historically accurate, but much more complex and longer as well. The Russian Campaign and its forebear, Stalingrad, are good introductions to war gaming and the war in Russia as well.

This is a better game than a simulation, and out of the box it is only a 6, but I give it an 8 because it is a fairly easy game to modify and I've made it into something I enjoy playing. It is almost impossible for the Germans to replicate their 1941 gains if the Russian player is smart. I know one of the points of wargaming is to change history but this is a fact that still annoys me. Also the out of supply rules do not work for me because it is too difficult to isolate units and cause them to surrender. You'll never see a massive pocket of Russians surrendering at Keiv. That being said this game is one of my favorite interpretations of the Eastern Front on a grand scale. I liked it more than [i]Russian Front[/i] and [i]EastFront[/i]

A very fine wargame, and coincidentally my favourite.  The whole war, playable over a couple of very long days, with gut wrenching excitement and killer die-rolls at various points.

Still, as is typical, I felt the need to revise it extensively as many highly competitive playings brought out annoying elements (such as Stalin regularly hiding in an Archangel basement etc).  Still played regularly in our annual competition.  Fully revised rules.

By far my favorite old-skool, "heavy" war game. TRC captures the feel for what the countries faced--supply problems, logistical dilemmas, untimely weather, annoying partisans, reinforcements not arriving fast enough. Enough valid initial strategies to keep things interesting, and the game is fluid from there. There's a set number of turns, so you know it won't last forever. Even still, it's just a little too long to  play, now, alas.

Over-rated "classic". My major objection is that it does NOT simulate the actual campaign, in particular the year 1941. Rigid zones of control and an outdated combat reults table belong back in the 1970s.  I'd rather play "Russian Front" instead.

I found over several plays with fairly matched opponents that if the weather rolls for the first winter go really bad for one player, the other will always win. As long as the weather is not too harsh or light then the game is anyones.

Not being able to retreat through a ZOC to a hex held by a friendly unit can feel very gamey at times too.

A good hex and counter East Front games.  The airpower and blitzkrieg rules well create the German breakthroughs and make the game a tense and exciting race for Moscow and subsequent see-saw battle through 1943.

A masterpiece in the classical era of wargame history.  I was hooked by this game and thus addicted to board wargames ever since (the rest is history).  Roger MacGowan design of the game box cover is still the best for any wargames by the stunning combat action scenes: winter war on Leningrad, in the streets and house of Stanlingrad, on the summer steppes of the SS advance to Moscow, and on the war-worn Red Army soldier face.  It truly reflects what a classical masterpiece that &quot;Russian Campaign&quot; is -- it captures the entire war on the Eastern Front and yet with sufficient operational detail.  The game sharply focuses on all the important aspects of the campaign with several scenarios on all the important phases of the campaigns by years.  It accurately, in a fair degree, portrays the doctrine of Blitzkerig, the maneuvering
tactics at German division level, the concept of war theatre and fronts, the major Russian terrain and their effects on combat (Piper Marsh, Caucasus mountain, road and railroad networks etc.), the different types and nationalities of combat units (German, Russian, Italian, Romanian, Finish etc.), sea movement, supply line system, replacement and reinforcement etc.  The game has all the proper abstraction and yet, it seems that you have gone through an important WW 2 military lesson without all the hassle of the details.  On Avalon Hill&#039;s complexity scale 4 out of 10, it shows how wargame could be fun and yet rich in historical details without complicated system (I never find similar complexity game at that level and that elegant again).  The later Gamers&#039; OCS series on the same campaign (e.g. Guderian Blitzkerig, Enemy at the Gates) or the Russian Front by the same AH just can&#039;t replicate the same too good a feeling about the war.  It is astonishingly amazing after all as this is a game produced in the 70&#039;s and it does not have all that &quot;out-dated&quot; smell like other games produced in the same decade.  Today, the game is still fresh to play and the fond memory is still very much refreshing in my mind.  This is the definitive game on the subject and a great introduction to anyone who is interested in warfare simulation.

I had the original JEdKo version, ordered from Australia to Alaska, as I remember.

BRILLIANT design by John Edwards - FAR better simulating Blitzkrieg and Russian counteroffensive than Stalingrad, of course.

The 2-month turns (with second impulse movement for German and some Russian units) increased speed of play, but I felt it made the game too time-tight, so ... I went ahead with my own Russian Front game design.  :-)

Also, I felt the representative 1941 Russian mechanized corps were too uniform and weak.  Historically strong units like 3., 4., 6, 7., 8. MexKor should have had 4 combat factors, at the very least.

And I think I have lost RC every time I have played it.  :-)

Russian Campaign, African Campaign, War At Sea, Fortress Europa, War in Europe ... John Edwards will forever be one of the foremost wargame designers.  Maybe someday he'll finish his Ardennes/Bulge game.

RATING: 5
Incredibly advanced for the time.  Now the system is dated and the lack of any decent chrome leaves the game pretty repetitive.  Also, the counter mix tends to lead to a situation where either player is in the situation where they simply cannot cover the front.  As a result, breakthroughs are often the result of a failure to have enough units as opposed to the ability of the opponent to force a hole.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A very, very good game. Innovative with its double impulse. I have seldom seen it used in other games, which is in fact a bit strange. Especially wargames ought to benefit from a system where one smashes the enemy troops and then move out.
Relatively small, fast and furious. 
 
A somewhat surprising fact I have noticed is that if I play it solitary the side where I sit and which counters I can see head-on (I always flip the enemy counters 180 degrees) seems to win almost all the time. Psychological bias affecting the die roll, or simply the fact that I have better overview when looking head-on and can make better decisions?

My brothers and I played this game so many times we wore out two sets of counters. This game is easy to learn and play; hardly any frantic rules book page flipping to see if you can or can't do this or that. A lot of options are open for both sides.

There are no morale rules; they aren't needed. You can demoralize your opponent simply by playing the game. Those first two annual Clear Weather drives of the Germans can really make the Soviet player sweat. The German seems unstoppable, gobbling up huge tracts of territory, forcing surrenders with Stuka attacks, killing workers, capturing city after city, driving relentlessly toward Moscow and the eastern edge of the board. The Soviet can feel at times as though he's barely hanging on.

By the summer of 1943 there are some huge battles with enormous sums of attack factors, leading to some uber-anxious die rolls for the weakening Germans. That's when the Soviet can turn the tables and make the German sweat. Targeting and destroying overstretched German panzer corps, especially the strong SS panzer corps in their intimidating black livery, can really ruin the German's day and give the Soviet a nice morale boost. There's no need for a rule regarding initiative either; players can feel the swing through the game's mechanics. Then it's payback time for the Soviet. 

It's a very fun FTF game playable in 3-4 hours ('til about late fall of 1943, when it becomes evident that the German has either a chance yet for victory or just a slow, agonizing retreat to ultimate doom). That's where our games would usually end, but that satisfied our gaming expectations. Setup for an experienced player takes about 30 minutes. 

Adding appropriate extra rules (like realistic supply rules, etc.) can really enhance the game without changing its simple character, basic mechanics or ease of play. We eventually added AH General variants (weather zones), optional rules (armored halved against cities) and house rules (Sturmoviks) and later played using TRC counters, rules, etc. on the AH Russian Front map boards (the TRC map board is ugly and plain). RF boards make it harder on the German player, but hey, that campaign was hard on the Germans. 

I still play this game sometimes, solo, all the way to the fall of Berlin. It lends itself well to solitaire play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I resisted picking this one up when I was a growing up because it looked uninteresting to me. When I finally bought it, I realized my mistake. One of my most played wargames, including many solitaire plays. Rules are very straightforward, and the system is nice -- double impulse moves allows the Germans to recreate their initial blitz, and their small number of reinforcements allow a Soviet offensive later in the game should they survive. Just a great design, there are few better under the more or less 'classic' wargame umbrella. Probably should be a '10', as I would play it any time. Campaign game is fairly lengthy.

There are a few poorly worded rules, but nothing that can't be worked out. I see only two likely outcomes to this game: a quick German victory or a draw. The German player absolutely has to make huge territorial gains before the first bad weather turn, then hold on through the first brutal winter. At this point, it should be pretty obvious whether the German has any chance. This might be a good game with players of different skill levels: the less experienced/skillful player takes the Russian side, the more experienced/skillful players takes the German side. A good, solid design that seems to have aged well, despite the tendency to play to a draw.

This game seemed so sophisticated all those years ago (impulses!), but now I see not well-organized or written rules, the lack of unit steps, mandatory combat, and a host of other tells that the state of the art has long passed this old friend.

It's hard to watch the Soviets forced out of Kiev on a DR result because they cannot ignore it.  It's also painful to watch the entire game hinge on the Sept/Oct 1941 weather roll.  I'll bring it out for another try someday, but it may be a while.

One of my first wargames, and a classic design.

RATING: 7
This version has for a very long time withstood the test of time. It maybe a bit flawed in comparison with the 4th edition, but yet very much entertaining. It is still reasonably balanced in comparison with previous editions.  Perfect game to play if you are under time shortage or for the first entry level novice players before they move off to the next edition or higher level games. Still worth holding onto this game in my personal collection. It is best playing this game with optional rules & perhaps with "what if scenarios".

Classic hex and counter - not weighed down by unnecessary detail, whilst that which it does include adds plenty to the game. It does a great job of portraying the flow of the campaign and it can feel like you are constantly on the edge of defeat. To play the whole thing does take time, and it can get bogged down at times but overall this is a classic for a reason, and should be a template for anyone looking to design a simple hex and counter game that has bags of playability and theme.

RATING: 7.5
This class AH wargame moves very fast in comparison to its contemporaries, probably due to the two impulses each player gets per turn.  The topography makes for some interesting (and variable) tactical decisions, and the weather plays an interesting (and accurate) role in the game's outcome.  The stukas allows the German player to roll through the western border of Russia with ease early on, but as the fall of 1941 arrives the disparity in reinforcements  and stretched supply lines stiffen the Russian defense.  As the winter wears on, the battle lines are drawn for a protracted conflict.  Although this is the most smooth of the AH historical simulations I've played, the "sudden death" game we played lacked the "ebb and flow" that the designers worked so hard to integrate.  We'll play the campaign version next time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Rightly called a classic, this game has actually aged farily well.  It has a chess-like economy of pieces and real estate.  There are certain key hexes you must defend, but you need to be flexible in case the dice don't go your way. Would like to play again.

I have the original 1974 JEDKO version of this game as well.  Well thought out and very FUN.  Double impulse moves add to the excitement.  Germans have plenty of Stuka units to start.

The fact that this game still rates so highly so long after it's come out probably speak volumes, but for me it was just another you go / I go wargame with too many chits, too much stacking / odds calcs, and consequent downtime, in a theatre that doesn't grab me as it's too wide a front / scope. At least this proved accessible rules-wise, but I moved my copy on to a happier home.

30 years to get around to the first playing of the 2nd edition. The game has many virtures but the Stukas and the 2nd impulses sure stress me out playing the Russians. Overall I think I like Stalingrad better!

A skilled German player, with average weather rolls, should overrun the Soviets. Would best be a solitaire exercise. And maybe the Campaign victory conditions could be tweaked a little: Hitler must stay in Germany & victory if 100 combat factors can be moved off the opposing board edge.

(Could 'Stuka' bombing really affect odds to the degree depicted in the game? Maybe 3 column shifts in Clear, 2 in Woods, and 1 in Mountains and Cities.)

RATING: 8
One of my favourite all time games. Played it heavily during the mid 80's. Nice Eastern Front feel to it as the Axis will enjoy devastating success on the initial invasion turns. 
The Germans will need all the luck they can get, as mud and snow turns will grind the offensive to a halt in later turns. 
Soviet replacements and reinforcements will inevitably turn the tables as the campaign drags on. Very difficult game for the Axis to win, as it should be.
Excellent mid-complexity game.

5.) Fantastic playability.
6.) Very good replayability :) 
7.) Very good historical simulation although there are much in deep examples out there. 

Curiosities:

1.) No advance after combat.
2.) German air superiority with use of stukas. Great advantage in the very first turns. 
3.) Great, what if possibilities. For example, you can decide as German player, to bring Mr. Erwin Rommel and his AK bunch from the desert to Russia. 
4.) No roads just normal, rail and sea movement.
5.) Hitler and Stalin presence very important for victory conditions. 
6.) Several different versions about the same system like the Australian from Jedko, the most recent is the L2 Design group 4th edition, recorded as a different game in the BGG. 

Well, definitely a must have in any game collection.

One of the all-time great wargames, and a true classic. Highly playable, reasonably realistic, and still in print decades after its initial release. Victory conditions that are somewhat arbitrary or "gamey" are the game's  only blemish.

A little big for me when I was introduced to it. I expect I would like it better today.

Of course, these days there's been a few East Front games more-or-less built off the same model, and I'm left debating which to get....

Get this out and play it. Of all the games on your list, this one deserves some time on the table! And finding opponents for this game might be easier than ANY wargame ever published! It is that good! It is STILL that good 30 years later, and I don't care if you are talking the third edition or the beautiful new 4th edition!

I spent most of my time with The Russian Campaign playing it solitaire, and enjoying every minute of it. At the time I really felt this classic captured the feel of eastern front combat, and the odd thing was, even playing it solitaire, there were times when I just didn't know which side would win. I eventually played a few games with a friend or two, excitement level was high.

RATING: 6
This would be a really good game, but I think that it's fundamentally imbablanced. I don't think the German player has a chance against a good Russian player. Perhaps a couple of rules changes, or maybe a preset Russian deployment might make it more interesting. However, a good Russian pregame deployment, can virtually ensure a Russian victory.

Jedko version. Ok, I'm partially colourblind and the FRICKIN' counters are only marginally different in terms of colour shade. One side is olive, the other side is tan. Man, renders the game unplayable. The AH version had Yellow and Tan counters.

TRC is a classic at what it covers. Of course many have come since then, but TRC remains a good one to come back to that many old grognards have played. It also has had a number of updates and variants through the years.

RATING: 4
A simple game with some good ideas, but it allows many "gamey tactics", that ruins any resemblance with the real war in east front. You only enjoy during your first games, when you only figth and defend for terrain, and are not only thinking about weather and biting your opponent´s ear. 

Its successor "Russian Besieged", from L2 Design, seems to be a little more accurate as a historic simulation.

On the short list of all-time greats. A little weak in terms of OOB accuracy, but just right in simulating German sickle and Russian sledgehammer. One of those games which is able to induce sweaty-browed tension in both players at the same time. All of this in eight pages of rules and 200-plus counters.

In technical terms, this is a doozy! What a great game! Missed many a party playing this. Some of my friends would just look at me in total disbelief. But I knew I'd have more fun playing this.

I'm sure it will remain a favorite.

One of my favorite strategic wargames. Mine is the AH 2nd Edition. Played this a lot in the 80s, but it's collected a lot of dust since then. Tough to play the Soviets in the opening turns - tough to play the Nazis in the later game.

This one plays fast and does a good job of recreating the actual campaign.  I like the some of the 4th edition options, like that revised weather table.  It keeps games from getting too skewed by weather.

I agree with many comments posted.  This game is high on my list of replayable and playable games.  The size is 'travel friendly.'  A classic wargame with lasting appeal.  Buy 3rd and 4th eds.  3rd, because it has the mounted map and you can go places with it, 4th because its got big pieces and large hexes with awesome counters.

One of the best of the traditional, old-school wargames.  Plays quickly, strategies are intuitive, fairly realistic, and always balanced and interesting*.  The rules are actually pretty good for a wargame. But it's still a wargame, and thus has very limited appeal for most folks.  Wish I could play it more.

Very, very, well suited for PBEM.

* Barring the ridiculous MOO (Massive Odessa Overrun) or Southern Strategy, where a rules loophole (only 1st impulse army attack restrictions, not 2nd) allows the German to pile units into Rumania and blow huge holes in the south.

My brother owned AH's Stalingrad and for years we played it near to death. But when this game came out it instantly became a cult classic. Everyone in our club either owned one or was trying to get one.
You only have to look at how well worn mine is to see how popular it was. Even now it is still one of the best games out to recreate the war in Russia. If your looking for a game that can be played in a single afternoon this is it. (yeah, ok, it'll have to be a long afternoon)
Another true classic. And while I don't own any of the revised issues out there, I have seen them and they only improve on it more. (and make it longer)
This is another of those games that can be easily played by a beginner.

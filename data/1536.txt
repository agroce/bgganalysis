Surprisingly simple card game involving making meals from ingredients and deck building.

Zombies are in the theme, zombies are very popular. Makes this a good game for NGs!

Do not play this game with more than 4, there are not enough cards to go around.
With 3/4 it is a pretty good game of timing and bluff, but with more it deteriorates very badly into a game of pure luck.

Our gaming group used to play this quite a lot but it has been a long time since it has reached the table.  I bought a newer version but it has not been played.  Perhaps one reason is that our daughter worked as a manager at a famous burger chain restaurant and anything related was taboo.

One of the best Cheapass games made even better by Steve Jackson Games.  The new version has 8 menus, much better printing quality (duh) and accommodates more players.  Definitely an improvement.  This game is not to be taken too seriously, but has plenty of strategy to make it exciting.

Game is good. Setup is boring.

RATING: 7
The Friedey's games are perennial favorites around here, and this game is no exception. Get rid of all of your cards first by filling orders, and the longer the customer waits, the sloppier you can be about what you feed them.

Unlike Give me the Brain, the deluxe editions of LotF (there have been two) have both added nicely to the base game, first with more cards and menus, and then nicer menus and chits to track extra points with.

WARNING: never play this with eight players! Just because you can doesn't mean you *should*. The sweet spot for this seems to be three or four, and I think five is a good maximum.

The game is interesting, but it just plays too long for such a random fest. You might get stuck with worthless cards, with not much options to get rid of them. The theme is funny, and it does work as a filler or sorts, only it plays a bit too long for a filler.

RATING: 7.2
Better than its partner Give Me The Brain (not saying too much) - this is a race to get rid of your cards in tricks, rather like a number of other card games and perhaps slightly too long, but certainly enough fun (and with enough stupid names - Adoration of the Baby Cheeses anyone?) to pass an hour or so.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It's quarter past midnight on a Friday night.  You're stuck manning the griddle at the local grease pit known as Friedey's "Home of the Cowbunga Conga".  You look over at Alex who is manning the register.  With one eyeball hanging out of his socket and a permanent grin on his face you can't tell just how depressed he really is.  The line is 15 people deep thanks to the bar next door closing and drunkards looking to fill their bellies with grease, and red meat.  Like sharks smelling blood in the water a feeding frenzy is about to begin.

"Better get to it", you think as the meat on the grill beginnings to sizzle, spit, frickle, frazz and dance on thin layer of low grade peanut oil.  

The aroma of seared meat hits you and you ascertain that whatever's cooking smells just about done.  You look down and realize that you've been standing with one hand on your hip and the other laying flat atop the griddle.  You're right hand is just about medium rare at this point.  

"One Cowabunga Conga with some Purple Drank coming up!" you shout from down the line!

Lord of the Fries, much like other games in the Cheapass line, is great fun for the whole family.  The artwork is great, the menu items are stupid/funny and the gameplay is easy to grasp.  This is a great pub-style game or something for family game night.  It handles a large crowd which is always nice.  Very much enjoy this one.

RATING: 5.5
Amusing every once in a while.  The menus can be annoyingly sparse in terms of combo's... but learning how to manage your hand based on the menu is all part of the game.  Rolling the die to pick an order can be deadly if you get something too easy (i.e. small 1-2 card orders)... think of losing a trick in a trick-taking game, where the momentum gets sucked from your sails.  ** Perhaps the gameplay would improve if the player who rolls the dice can take first crack at filling the order (official rules = first crack goes to the player to the left of the one who rolled)... or even giving first crack only when the order is small (i.e. 1 or 2 card orders).   This variation should encourage more players to roll for orders, reducing the downtime of choosing an order.

Another good, quick Cheapass game, perfect for when you've spent all your energy on a two-hour brain burner. Hard to tell who's going to win until the very end! The best strategy I've found is the one listed in the rules--roll orders until you have limited cards in your hand, and then call orders only you can fill. Again, though, much luck involved, so who can tell.

This is not too bad of a game.  Artwork is horrendous, but the gameplay is pretty smooth, and makes for some interesting possibilities.  Overall, a decently fun family game based on hand management and a little bit of press-your-luck.

Do not play this game with 8 people, especially when two of them are children.  5 is probably a good maximum number, but other than that, it gets unweildy and too long.

A humorous premise.  Mindless zombies are put to work in a fast food restaurant.  There are variations on the menu to add variety to the game, but the alternate menus don't do enough to keep the game interesting to me on successive replay.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
This is a fun, light-weight game. It's a spinoff of Cheapass' earlier zombie card game Give Me the Brain. Now instead of trying to complete chores to get to go home, you are trying to fill customer's orders.

I have both the original 1st edition game, and the 2015 KS version. The original was fun, but got stale after a few plays with only one menu & deck. Now that there are multiple decks with different menus, you can add some variation including some combinations of decks.

Much like I imagine it would be like to be a zombie, this game just drags on.  You seldom get to make what appear to be meaningful choices.

Played once. Didn't really grab me. Feels too random and samey, not that different from other set collection games. I'd much rather play other games where cards can do more (Island of D2, Glory to Rome etc.), though I guess if you like games that feature cool zombie cartoon this could hold some interest.

An alright trick taking game, that tries to infuse it's self with humor.  I feel it lasts a little longer than it should.  Semi-humorous illustrations and color elevate this a little beyond other cheap ass productions, but over all it's forgetable.

We're big fans of the "brain" series here. In this game players are again zombies working in a restaurant. This time though they are competing to complete meal recipes.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Play seems to devolve into who is lucky enough to stump the rest of the table first, they can then collect cards until they start choosing recipes that only they can fill.  Two out of the three rounds were completely dominated by one player.  The third was slightly more open, but only slightly.

Too much downtime for everyone but the one person who is dominating, and I say that after being one of the persons who dominated a round.

Fun, easy game.  Pretty easy to teach and non-gamers pick it up, but sometimes lasts too long.  Picking the right size menu for the number of players can help this a bit.

* Kickstarted! *

Roll the dice to determine the menu item that's been ordered. Then, players take turns trying to make the item using the ingredients they have on the cards in hands -- or they can pass a card (and play) to the next player to try, and then removing an ingredient if everyone passes to make the meal. Points are valued when someone has run out of cards.

PLUS: easy to learn, simple fun for all ages
BIG PLUS: different menus are available as extra decks
MINUS: good for a few plays but not as a main game for the night

I bought the deluxe version because people never seemed to want to play the original. Figured with better cards (and color), I'd get to play more. I was right. Plus...the deluxe edition has more ingredients and more menus. Very much like the mechanics in this one. And they work with the theme too.

Was more appealing back in the days when the crazy zombie theme appealed to me. The gameplay is interesting, although it is marred somewhat by the possible combinations of cards that you can play is a fairly random list, so it's hard to form a good strategy until you've memorized the combinations on the menu you are playing.

One of the best Cheapass games, nice for non-gamers, too. Some people do their very best to accomodate their style of play to the theme (slooooww zombies), sadly, and then it can be rather grueling. But when played fast, it&#039;s a wonderful filler.

Played 20+ times.

Lord of the Fries is a decent game, with some interesting decisions and a good sense of humor.  Some of the names of the orders, like "The Adoration of the Baby Cheeses" are really clever, and definitely add to the game.

However, the game is a little too long for what it is.  There isn't really enough strategy to justify the time it takes to play, and eventually the humor wears off.  And now that the deluxe version is the only one available for sale, the price isn't all that special either.  It's not a bad filler, and it's fun to play, but there are better choices most of the time.

The sequel to the Cheapass Game Give me the Brain, this one is fun but doesn't have the same humorous feel of its predecessor.  I piked it up at the Seattle Comic Book and Card Convention back in 2000 where I was lucky enough to get it signed by Brian Snoddy and picked up a special edition menu postcard with it as well.

Fun, but saying "you're zombies working in a fast food restaurant" usually makes everyone want to try a different game (and postpone ordering the pizza).

I picked up a new copy of the original and the McPubihans Irish Pub deck in the kickstarter.

Light, filler card game about filling orders from the menu. At first it seemed like there was no strategy and it was just luck, but with another play I realized there with a little strategy. I wish there was a mechanism to overcome being dealt a bad hand as there was nothing to offset it if that happened.

Seemed long with 6 players. Aside from that, it was a lot of fun. Not heavy on the strategy, but an enjoyable experience. Next I play, I'll push for no more than 3 rounds.

Feels half-baked; the outcome is almost completely random. Oh, you can decide not to fulfill orders like "Lord of the Fries" to keep a balanced hand, but it's a grain of hand-management weighed against a mountain of luck.

This is one of my go-to games for medium-sized groups of mixed company (different age groups, strangers, etc.). It always goes over well... rules are super-simple to learn and while there's no super-sophisticated strategy, the cards/recipes are fun and it has surprisingly good replay value.

RATING: 8
An odd but fun game about recipies.  Players make menu items from their hands using a list of ingredients on a fast-food style menu.  A bit brutal in the scoring in that you score negative for the value of cards in your hand, not just the number of cards in your hand.

RATING: N/A
Players choose orders (sometimes randomly, sometime not) from the figuratively colorful Friedey's menu, and try to fill them with cards from their hands. Some orders are easy, like the Cowabunga. One Cow Meat, one Bun. Some are a little harder, like the Chickabunga Conga: same as a Chickabunga (Bird Meat plus Bun), plus Fries and a Drink. Sound easy? Now try your hand at a Lord of the Fries, a Meat Munch, or the infamous Patriarch (Fish Meat, Cheese, Bun, Fries, Drink, and the oft-maligned Strawberry Pie).

Fun light filler game, with a funny theme.  Can run a little long if people have to keep constantly checking the menus, so it's a good idea to make a few photocopies of it.

The zombie theme is pretty much tacked-on but it adds a nice dose of humor, especially in the names of the menu items.

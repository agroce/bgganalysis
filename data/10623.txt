Berg Design. GBACW system. Covers key battes of the Mexican-American war of 1846. Some terrific looking terrain to fight over! Full of the usual RHB chrome, events, quirky history. A nice package.

Playing one of Berg's GBACW games is always a bit like absorbing a bad Sunday school lesson - you have to fill in your own blanks and have faith everything will turn out OK in the end. Sometimes it's worth the effort. This is one of those. Some short, playable scenarios (well, for GBACW anyway)

RATING: 8
Again a great introduction into GBACW. The battles we smaller and easier to manage with the chain of command structure and rules. Battles move more quickly than other games in the series. A little unbalanced but not unrealistic In A historical sense. Highly recommended for anyone looking to get into GBACW.

Rating might go up. Only played El Moline del Ray 3 times up to now. For this very small scenario the rules seem a bit like overkill. Speaking of rules: Considering the rules already had many revisions they might be quite a bit clearer. The maps are beautiful!
I basicalllly bought this for Monterey, but considering that this will take more than 30 houres it might take a while till I tackle this one.
Update: Played (solo) Buena Vista by now. Rating will probably stay. While every single turn is interesting, the game is a bit to slow (and detailed) for my taste.

A nicely done game on the fascinating battles from the Mexican-American War 1846=1848 that because of its many historical parallels to the politics of today I grew interested in for a time.  

Am hoping to get this on the table. Like Men Of Iron and Infidel, the maps in Gringo and its Expansion really drive the respective units in each fight. Working the unit capabilities into the map to find victory looks like fun. Attilla66 seems to be the most willing victim to  try this system out with.

Always nice to have some shorter, one-map scenarios to satisfy that tactical ACW urge. And somehow the chrome exceses that this system is prone to aren't as glaring in the smaller games.

RATING: 7
Nice system. Rules are well organized for the most part, but a few stumbling points still exist. A good amount of chrome.  Colorful maps and units, the usual great production values from GMT. May be too complex for some gamers' tastes. As with most games of this complexity, it sometimes feels like the game is playing you. The scenarios themselves are the low point, at least from the 2 I've played so far. The Mexicans are poor, their leaders worse, and many of them are not even allowed to activate! So it feels like you're reacting to the U.S. player rather than playing a game. Maybe this is realistic, but it hurts the enjoyment factor. In fairness to the game, some of the other scenarios may be better. Overall, still a well done game on an interesting and unusual series of battles.

Many of the above comments about this game being easy to play are misleading. This is a complex system made playable only by the small size of the battles covered. Not a bad system but I've found that I prefer fast and furious tactical games over complex ones. I'm fine with complexity in grand strategic games but not tactical ones except for [i]Great Battles of Alexander[/i].

The "Great Battles of the Civil War" system translated to an undergamed conflict.  It fits well, and is a great practical lesson in how the tactics of this war would translate into the early part of the Civil War.  I don't think a game can do much more than that.  It's also easy to play.

   Some very good tactical puzzles from a war that had more in common with Napoleonic battles than Civil War ones.     If you think the Mexican War was an exercise which saw one Anglo chasing three hapless Mexicans over the battlefield, think again.   The Mexican regular infantry are on average as good as the American regulars, and there are a LOT of them.   There's more of a difference in artillery, but again, the Mexicans have quantity to make up for quality.  And while most of the Mexican cavalry are better at parading than fighting, they do have lances and it won't take too many lucky charge rolls to give the gringo infantry fits.

I don't think the GBACW system is broken.  It is very intricate compared to some but not any more complex, than, say, the Gamers old CWB series.  I enjoy it, and I enjoy its application to the Mexican War.

The most accessable of the new GBACW Series (version 4.x) from GMT.  The five scenarios in the game range from very small slugfests that you can play in an evening to larger pitched battles.  This may have rated higher if not for the minor quality issues (missing second disorder chart, hex row with only three digits when there should have been four.)

GBACW series games.  The battles are obscure to me except Buena Vista.  even so, I find it not as interesting as I would have hoped for if the system is to be applied to non-Civil War games. Another cash-in item based on a tried game system for GMT only.

GBACW series set in the Mexican War.  5 scenarios are included and there is one more in c3i (Churubusco).  GBACW is interesting - an orders driven system that depends on command ranges.  When you give orders they are sometimes not obeyed and units march to their destruction or fail to march when you want them to do so.  Also, the chit pull system for activations is another factor of unpredictability that makes each play of the game different and challenging.  Some of these scenarios are fairly one-sided, but all of them are interesting.  Use the latest GBACW rules (Dead of Winter) and you are set.

If you're new to the GBACW system, this is a good place to start.  Most of the battles are pretty small and the command rules are streamlined, letting players focus on movement and combat.  The scenarios are very interesting and you get counters for each separate scenario, which makes things easy to set up.

RATING: 7.5
Laced with errata but still the surprise gem of the GMT-era GBACW series. The Mexican War is so colorful, so stuffed with interesting unit types and clashing personalities and diverse situations and unique terrain that not even Berg could rob the topic of its appeal. On the practical side, several of the battles are good introductions to the game system. Have played (solitaire) Molino del Rey, Cerro Gordo, Churubusco (C3i bonus), and Chapultepec and all delivered fine narratives.

Fantastic game, one of my personal favorites. Very deep strategically and a lot of what I've been looking for in my gaming experience. Plus, it's a hell of a lot of fun, which is always a bonus! Played all scenarios but Monterey. Suggest El Molino Del Rey for beginners, followed by Cerro Gordo. Leave Buena Vista for either a long set up, or a really long play time, very good scenario. I would not suggest Chapultapec for anything but solo play, it's just not fun for the Mexican army. What does it say about my relationship to this game when I have half of the total games played for this game on BGG!

I'm not typically one for Berg games, but this one is not bad at all. Relatively low counter density and small battles like Molino del Rey and Cerro Gordo save the system from itself.

Gringo includes a number of battles (plus a free one downloadable from their site) on a war never covered together as far as I know. I believe Worthington Games is planning one as their next in their series on American Wars. But GMT's Gringo maps are very beautifully done. This is the only one in that (actually more on the Civil War) series that's really interested me. I have a LOT of CW games going back decades, but this one is unique!

RATING: N/A
Essentially TSS for the Mexican American War. I actually prefer the S&T Magazine edition of the game, as it was easier to teach and parse. GMT's imprint sort of... added more detail than necessary... yeah, that's the ticket.

Anyway,I keep it primarily as a reference for miniatures gaming, as the battle scenarios are exceptionally well researched and mapped (the history is sometimes a bit off when it comes to orders of battle, but the engagements themselves are well done.)

I have been playing the gbacw games off and on for over 20 years, but the system is still fiddly to me. I don't know if you get more bang for the buck with the added complexity and I really feel for someone who sits down alone and tries to figure these rules out without the help of an experienced player. Having said that, I still prefer gbacw over the Gamer's CWB series just because I don't care for written orders. Gringo is the best (only) beginning point and the different scenarios provide a nice variation of tactical situations. The Mexicans aren't entire pushovers, but they re the bigger challenge to play. These games solitaire well since they rely on a chit pull command system.Actually Chapltapec is best solitaire since the Mexicans don't have much to do. The maps and counters are beautiful and GMT offers a sixth scenario for download. An additional expansion is also about to be published (late 2008)

just finished playing Cerro Gordo scenario, with AnthonyN., US genl.
I, Santa Anna, I managed to do better than the genl. and pulled a victory in the 5th turn by BCE of three american brigades.
It was really touch and go for a while, trying to get the mexican brigades activated and losing an AM for each one of those activation and then waiting another turn to move/fight.
What a great game.
I will play again and again.
My pics will be posted on consim world.

Love that you get a large number of small to medium sized scenarios in this game, great way to learn GBACW, even though it's a little different from other games in the series, mostly due to army command structures.  The Mexicans aren't as hopeless to play as you'd think, but their morale is usually pretty fragile.

GAME: Early American Chrononauts
RANK: 2276

RATING: 7
*(Solo) 
Cool addon for Chrononauts

This adds the revolutionary period through early 20th century america. I wish it had been more global like the original game. 

This expansion is playable alone, and nearly doubles the timeline when in play with the original. A lot of neat stuff in here, but adds a lot to the already long setup and tear down.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.7
Maybe because I have an older version of Chrononauts or something, I don't like the time machines in this one. And not having a Hitler-like linchpin makes the board less interesting for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Board game geek auctions for the win. While the core gameplay has not changed . The expanded play option is much more convincing.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
The exact same game as regular Chrononauts. The only real reason to get it is to combine it with regular Chrononauts to play UBERChrononauts. That said, combining the two games make them a whole lot better.

I loved the television show "Sliders" and the idea of time travel in general. It is a really great card game. Very simple artwork. It works great with 2 or more players. I have also played it as the solitaire variant and it wasn't bad. Created by the fine people over at Looney Labs. Adria hates this one.

Great expansion for Chrononauts. The gadgets seem pretty strong. The main reasons for getting this would be to play Uber Chrononauts - which is a great twist on the whole game.

RATING: 7
A whole new set of history, new characters, new mission goals and some new devices to use, otherwise it's good ol' Chrononauts. Only played once since we got RFTG soon after. We played the "UberChrononauts" version where you set up both this one and the base set to make a huge timeline, it was pretty fun.

RATING: 6.5
This game is not as fun as the original Chrononauts unless you are really into U.S. history, which makes it less appealing to the public elsewhere.
Nevertheless, it retains the same playability and you can combine the two games into a heavier game called ÜberChrononauts.

RATING: 10
Awesome. A great addition. The only downside is it is unlikely that there will be more in the near future.... perhaps, if I could get a time machine...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Never played it as a standalone. Turns the original game into a more involved, more flexible variant, but also takes a lot more time to play. Good fun if you have an evening to devote to it.

RATING: 8
Great reworking of the original in a prior century. Plays a bit smoother, too.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Everything to love about Chrononauts is back in EAC.  The absence of the Unstable Patch and the UberParadox make this set easier to teach Chrono with, but newbies find the history of the original set more engaging.  Players love the gadgets introduced in this set (and added to ChronoClassic later).  Best of all, it can be combined with Chrononauts to form an epic time travel game, Ubernauts!

RATING: 8
It is unfortunately similar to Chrononauts. It's unfortunate in that, aside from having a different set of events to play with and artifacts to collect, there's nothing to make one prefer this version to the original. There aren't any unique quirks of gameplay like Chrononauts' 1945 Nexus or Uberparadox.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Good expansion to Chrononauts, but essential for Uber Chrononauts which is quite possibly the game I can wipe the floor with my friends at. I'm a modest player and I typically play for the social aspect, but I will fuck you up playing Uber Chrononauts.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Learned a lot about our early history playing this. I knew of every event in the original, but many events in this were new to me.   Pretty fun and educational, low on strategy.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I played Early American Chrononauts as a companion to the Chrononauts game.  It didn't add to the original game much. The content isn't quite as good, and some cards feel "forced".  

While *okay* as a stand-alone game, I'd advise to stick with the original Chrononauts as a stand-alone, and not to worry about expanding the experience.  If you REALLY enjoy the game, then buy EAC, but use it separately from Chrononauts.

Interesting and funny, but lacking challenge and replayability.  If interested in American history, consider my rating to be a "5" for you only.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
Played 5 times. Note: This game is wretchedly boring with 2 players. Think Fluxx with some structure (I hate Fluxx.) I want to like this game, time travel messing with timelines in early American history. (What? No "1812 -Canada conquers the USA"?) It's just too light and random. Also quite one-dimensional. The only thing I like about the game is letting my imagination run with these alternate timelines... [o/g]

A not great companion to the original, and don't fool yourself, the two don't combine.  At least not well enough to make a good game.

I enjoy the theme of the original Chrononauts more and find its timeline more fascinating.  But this is a fun trip through time as well.  I wouldn't play UberChrononauts (the combination of the two decks), as each deck is well designed as it is.  I find the game requires more strategy than many give it credit for, and there are multiple ways to win.

Maybe it's just that I'm too used to the original chrononauts, or the fact that I'm canadian, but these events seem less interesting than those in the orginal. The missions are blander as well, though the new time machines are cool >.>

Better than the original since it has "gadgets."  But highlights my desire for  "blanxx," so we can try Uber-Artifaxx by combining with the base Chrononauts.   I guess we could try putting all the Mission cards in protector-sleeves and that would hide the fact that some of them are hand-made combinations of artifaxx from both games.

As others have mentioned, the unfamiliar historical events make it a bit less accessible.  Although one could argue that it makes it educational.

I don't like this version as well as the original Chrononauts because I like the nexus at 1945 in the original version.

The problem with the Early American edition of Chrononauts is that most of the events are unfamiliar and it's much harder to role-play or to care about what's happening. I wish they'd done an ancient world version instead.

Played with these once, I think.  I like that they are different from the original game and can combine to make a huge timeline.  Still have to play this more, though.

The early history version of Chrononauts, it's a fun, if a bit wacky game of time travel played with a deck of cards and a 32-card time line detailing the first century and a half of American History.

Like Fluxx I definitely need to be in the right mood.  Artifact collecting seems to be the key to winning.  I like reading the cards events are changed.  I think that's what really makes the game.

A fun game that is great filler.  The addition of the gadget cards makes me appreciate this version more.  Although I have yet to try Uber Chrononauts, I'm sure it'd be great.

I love adding this to Chrononauts for a mega-game.

Better time machine cards and special cards, but not as fun because the historical events are much more obscure and limited. Playing Uber-Chrononauts (both games mixed together) also doesn't work too well because only 1 or 2 of the travellers have objectives across both timelines, so parts of the timeline go neglected too often.

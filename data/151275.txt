RATING: 9.5
An easy to learn and yet deep to master beautifully designed game. The mentioning of dice roll as one of its mechanices may give a wrong impression as the game offers lots of ways to bypass the dice roll and thus reduce the impact of luck.

There's alot to like with Ophir. It has great production values. It's easy to learn and play is smooth. There are even a couple unique features: such as rolling to pass by opponents and a sly market flux. But I'm not sure that adds up to a great game. Instead, after only a few plays, I think I've seen all it has to offer.

A bad kickstarter game I received in trade. The influence check is kidsy, grating and annoying; and a good example of the widely non-accepted mechanics found in the box.

How is this game rated so well? You all can have it. Maybe, just maybe, it is sellable. One can hope.

I do not like any of the mechanics, not that there are many. Fun? It isn't even tolerable.

You want it odd and repetitive? You got it. I would never willingly play this. My gaming partner also did not value it at all.

I'm not usually a fan of pick-up-and-deliver games but this one is an exception. I think that's because of how tight the map is, how critical timing can be, how quick player turns are, unique role abilities, and a very interesting dice-based system of obstructing movement. It's quick, light fun with a lot of interesting decisions to make.

I'm not a big fan of pick up and deliver in general. The powers felt unbalanced which made the game feel less fun. That is one problem with variable player powers. They're a double-edged sword, because they can make a game feel so unbalanced.

RATING: 5
Ok if not dissapointing, very dependent on turn order IMO. There is quite a sense of repetition due to the small board. Now to be fair the minimal board keep the play length down, but it's no fun to simply go round and around and back and forth over the same 7 hexes. 

I think the dice mechanic for moving through an opponent is tedious. Failing the die rolls a few times is a guarantee of failure with no option to recover.

Ophir is a great game. It is really easy to teach and play. The special abilities give players multiple paths to victory, but they still need to plan ahead to create their most efficient turns. There is a lot of luck due to the dice rolls but this allows seasoned and beginner players to play the game together, so I see it as a positive aspect of the game. Over all it's a fun game that plays well with 2 to 4 players.

Very basic pick-up-and-deliver game: move around in a small map, get goods to sell at the market and buy metals to convert into victory points at the temple. There is some luck with die rolls and chaos with the ever-changing market, which put this firmly in family-game territory. It may be a bit too simple, with very quick turns, but it's fine for what it is. The specialist cards could be more readable, but otherwise the production is excellent. One might even say the game is overproduced, as it really would work better as a small-box game. Two thirds of the board are not really necessary, and the very thick tiles of the temple could have been just cards. I must mention, though, that the box art is one of most beautiful I have ever seen.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is surprisingly a real good game, yes a few graphic design choices are a bit circumspect. Other wise the game is really fun.

Very tight gameplay, because of the small play space. That is only a part of the game.

Really like that you physically build the temple.

My first impressions of this is that if this gets German distribution, I can see this being, at the very least, a SdJ recommended for 2016.

I'll need to give it more plays to see if it is right for me.

Update: I played it more, and it started to get stale *really* quickly. I'm not sure on the longevity of this one. I can see this going down the "forgettable light-euro" route. Also, after playing Istanbul, I can't really see why I'd want to play this over that.

A very straightforward pickup-and-delivery game with a little bit of market manipulation mixed in. Beautiful artwork and great production value. The rulebook, however, is overly complicated and serves as a barrier to starting the game. Setup for my first game took over an hour and nearly prevented us from playing the game.

This made it into my Top 3 pickup and delivery games with just one play. I loved the mechanics of how the market worked. I thought that all of the player powers worked out well. And it was so pretty, from the artwork to the amazing components.

Jason is currently working on an updated, rethemed reprint that I'm really looking forward to. The changes he made definitely made this a better game.

Played this at BGG FAM 2015 with 4. Love the components and artwork. The game is interesting. It feels very tight, with little movement/action from turn to turn. More often than not, you are setting up a future action, rather than taking an immediate one. I think it's crucial that you utilize your special ability. That said, I'm not sure how balanced the abilities are, as I need more plays to judge. I like this game, and I'm hoping that it plays well with 2. I think it will. Will update later.

I like how all the pieces come together in this, and the components are great.  The board is small enough to keep everything very tight.  However, I don't think it plays as well with two players.  The Rival ship helps a bit, but doesn't quite do the trick.

I picked this up at Denver Comic Con this year and I do not regret it.  It is another hit with my gaming group, and is very easy and quick to explain.  2 players should never play this however, and it works best with 3-4 in my opinion as player interaction is maximized.  

A fun pick up and deliver game.

Based on one play: The art work is really nice but that was my favorite part of the game. It is a pick up and deliver game but there are not a lot of options and the board is so small that you are always chasing the same goods and blocking others. Could be an easy intro to the genre but became repetitive fast even though it is only 45 minutes long.

RATING: 5
Ophir is a light pick-up-and-deliver game.  The flow of the game is as follows: you need to pick up goods, trade them in according to contracts for money, use the money to buy metal, and then use the metal to build the temple (resulting in points).  The cost of metal gradually goes up over the course of the game, and halfway through the game the payout of the contracts goes up.  Naturally, each of the different "steps" requires you travel to a different hex, but since there are only seven hexes and you have two moves, theoretically it isn't much of an issue.  However, to move to a hex with another player's pawn, you have to roll a die an exceed the value on their die--if you don't, their die is reduced by one and you lose your move.  I really didn't like this aspect of the game--if your opponents happen to have high dice, it's a really strong incentive not to do things that are useful, since losing turns is a really harsh penalty.  That on top of a generally uninteresting pick-up-and-deliver system didn't much appeal to me.

RATING: N/A
Charming pick-up and deliver game, tho' it feels strange to go through a movement phase on a board of just seven hexagons, where, barriers apart, nowhere is more than two spaces from anywhere else. A strength of the game is the unique special ability each player gets to choose from. These look pretty well balanced, so that, whatever you choose, you will almost always be envious of your opponents' special powers, and they of yours.

Somewhat shallow game for the length and complexity of the rules: there are not really any variable strategies and it's mostly a case of optimising the tactic decisions for the market. Great chunky cardboard temple, though!

First Play with 3.  Rulebook could be better written, but we were able to figure it out without resorting to the video.  We think it would be a good gateway / gateway plus game.  With the variable setup, games are sure to be random. the dueling dice mechanic is a little wonky and doesn't seem to be thematically connected (unlike the other mechanics).  Beautiful game, great components.  Looking forward to more games

Very simple and streamlined game but done in a way that's quite engaging. Felt some of the components to be a bit extraneous though, particularly the board and the temple pieces. The game is light enough to work as a portable game but doesn't because of how big and bulky the box is.

I have played the game once and the game plays well.  Reasonably quickly with low downtime between turns. The game has a pickup and deliver for either coins or victory points.  The game has a very tactical feel to it.  Again the board changes fast enough that I don't quite get the trying to put a plan together and watch it come together satisfaction that I like.  Mind you I like games like 1830, Advanced Civ and Stoneage.  The only hit I will give the game is minor beefs with the board / card design ...... The player and chart is written in 4 point fonts to fit on the small ship.  Guys these 53 year old eyes cannot read that stuff in low to medium light.  Two the metal spaces in the temple can be hard to see.  edge them with a brighter color so they are obvious

I have played a few times. The game is accessible to lighter weight gamers, and introduces some heavier mechanics. The game is about efficient decisions with a pick up and deliver mechanic which I like. It's important to push the game forward by building up the temple and increasing building costs for everyone else creating a race to keep up. The small map feels a little claustrophobic, but it creates decisions on how to move, pushing your luck, and/or expending resources to guarantee movement. Asynchronous powers give every one an opportunity to try different strategies to gain an advantage and keep the challenges of the game fresh. The production quality is great. The game isn't deep, but it also doesn't overstay it's welcome at 45 minutes. I think if you like the pick up/deliver and market economic mechanics that you will like this game.

Bought after hearing Eric Summerer describing it. A very light pick up and deliver game on a small map. This lets you travel from any location on the board to any other location in 1 or 2 turns, so that you can focus on your strategy to victory.
I like it: it is engaging and light, without being trivial.

[b]1p[/b] [b][bgcolor=#99ffff] 7 [/bgcolor][/b] Quick enough, very easy to keep track of the AIs (they're dumb enough to summarize on a single playing card, but mix things up enough to keep it interesting), and fun. Racing the priests' ship felt tense, especially because every single time it hit "metal island", it was a high roll, and thus a gold. Nice!

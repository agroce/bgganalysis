In Mammut we are cavemen dividing up a pile of prey dumped in the middle of the table.  On your turn you can take as much or as little as you like as your share.  Be too greedy and someone will take it away from you.  A simple, but original mechanism that leads to some tough calculations and severe angst.  That calculation and the grab and counter grab can mean that Mammut runs well over its published 30 minutes' playing time.  For me that's a good thing and it lengthens the fun.

Mammut adds cards that either have an immediate effect or alter the end of round scoring.  The scoring is reminiscent of Ra, with different items scoring points or penalties in different ways.

Mammut is a filler rattling around in a big old Queen box.  That gripe aside, production quality is very good.  The artwork will win no prizes, but is functional.  The rules are fine.

Set collecting game very similar to RA in scoring but a unique method of gaining tiles.  Very much a I cut/you choose type of game with the double sided tiles dumped into the middle of the table.  I enjoyed this one and look forward to playing it again.  The rating could go up.

Up to an 8 from 7.25

Looks great, and sounded ok after the rules explanation - but went downhill after that.

I can see this descending into AP hell, with players calculating and recalculating the "cuts of the pie", then add in special action tiles (from the tools) that cause it to reset or at least change the game state and you'll wait and while they recalculate again.

Played rapidly as a filler with people just going on gut feeling for the splits it's fine (but nothing I'd rave about).

Theme is paper thin and overall, I just wanted it over, if I want to play cut the cake and pick a piece I'd  rather play Piece o'Cake ...

Probably the most complex "I split, you choose" games.  Each round begins by a pile of tiles being dumped.  A player can either choose to take a subset of the pile in the middle or take another player's pile returning some of it to the middle (that player was "too greedy").  Once everyone has a tile, players get VPs for a bunch of different reasons -- the most of this, each of those, cards played, ...  There's also a bunch of points in endgame scoring if you've collected a lot of different animals over the course of the game.

Other than the "I split, you choose" mechanic, there's nothing special here.  However, I really like that mechanic and it introduces enough other stuff that I think it's a good introduction for the kids.  I've played it twice with the kids and they really enjoyed it (the second time my youngest daughter lapped us).

Very mixed feelings on this one.  Some parts are brilliant:  the "choose your own stuff" mechanism means that you have very good control over what you want to try to end up with, and the ability to steal from players adds a unique balancing mechanism to cut down greed.   Quite clever.

However, the tool cards feel a little tacked on, and the penalty for least furs is way too harsh, particularly as once you fall behind it's difficult to catch back up.   The "give back all your stuff" card is also quite stupid and alone can lengthen the game considerably.

So.... I'll give this a 6 for now.  Certainly would play this again now that I understand how the scoring works a bit better.

Awesome divide and split mechanic. There's enough of a game around this core mechanic to make it playable but not too much so that it remains a lighter family game.

RATING: 7
Pretty good filler-type material utilizing a neat take on the "I split, you choose" mechanism.

Basically, there are a bunch of tiles that all score you points in various ways.  Some tiles simply score points for each of them you have.  Some score for getting the most of them in a round.  Some penalize you for getting the least of them.  You get the idea.

In a round, the tiles are dumped onto the table, and their face up sides are the available tiles for the round.  This is important, as the tiles are double-sided, so the selection can vary by quite a bit from round to round.

Then, the first player chooses which tiles he wants.  The next player can then steal that player's tiles, putting at least one of them back into the unclaimed tiles, or just take tiles he wants from the middle.  This process of either claiming tiles from the table or stealing from another player continues until the last player without tiles decides just to take the remaining tiles from the middle of the table.

So, you have a game where you want to be greedy in order to get good tiles and score points, but if you're too greedy someone else is going to grab them from you.  The game really reminds me of Ra, but with the "I split, you choose" mechanism instead of bidding, in that you're trying to get all of these types of tiles to score the best you can.

In the end, I'd say you should grab this if you really like the core mechanic.  You'll probably like it.  If you're not so hot on that mechanic, it may not be for you, as the mechanic is pretty much the entire game.

[i]Received this after winning the Queen Lancaster Games contest.[/i]

I would have never thought about getting this game if it wasn't for the fact I won it in a BGG contest. But once I read the rules, I was pretty excited. Mammut struck me as a light, family-friendly game with an interesting hook--you've got 31 tiles in the middle of the table, and on your turn, you grab the tiles from an opponent, or grab the pile in the middle... as many as you want. The round continues until everyone has a pile in front of them.

After one play, I have to say, that core mechanic of "I want your pile" is great. Players swap each other's loot in a back and forth, tossing one tile in the middle, until everyone feels satisfied. Then, you score tiles (tools, fire, fur, meat, etc.) in a Ra-like fashion. Tools get you cards, fur awards plus/minus points for most/least, player with least fire tiles gets -5 points, etc.

Mammut is interactive, fun, with a simple set of rules. Even better, the theme of cavemen divvying up the loot in a crude "gimme that" fashion really enforces that "I split you choose" mechanic. Mammut is one of the better family-weight games I've played in a while. While writing these comments, I see 104 copies owned on BGG. That's way too low. This game needs more love!

One last fun fact -- bonus points for including illustrations of a saber-tooth squirrel, saber-tooth racoon, saber-tooth duck, etc. Hilarious.

Update: believe it or not, I traded this one away. That's not an indictment of the game... I still think it's very good with a novel auction mechanic. My family, though, was a bit more lukewarm to it than I was, so off to the trade pile it went.

RATING: 7
Interesting mechanics: sharing, family style
Similar to other games: lite euro style with different scoring mechanics
General thoughts:  very fun game with neat mechanics and the quality you expect from a queen game. Older gamers will like it to as a diversion but it won’t win any awards for a gamer’s game.

Players are cavemen, dividing up the spoils of the latest mammoth hunt.  Simple, large box filler game where around 30 "prey" tiles are dumped out of a bag onto the table and left as they fall (tiles are double sided).  Players then take turns seizing prey - either taking as many tiles as they like from the table, or all the tiles from another player - however they must return at least one tile to the centre if they do this.  If you have prey, you skip your turn.  When everyone has prey, you score points in a very Ra-like fashion - gain for this, lose for that, etc.  Repeat over four or five rounds.  Amusing, fluid game that works very well, and does require some thought.  Do you get greedy... and if so, how greedy?   Too greedy and someone will grab your boodle.  Also inspired is the Shaman tile that also comes out of the bag, that determines who breaks ties, and in what direction.  A lot to like here ... very simple to teach.

Our group gave up on this one after two rounds. It's incredibly fiddly, takes longer to score a round than to play one, and the "one cuts, the other chooses" mechanic doesn't work when another player can just take everything. I know it's supposed to be about balancing how much you take, but there's no game here.

Mammut plays kind of like a bastard child of Ra and Shitenno. Players distribute the loot of a mammoth hunt among themselves, that is, the first player grabs from the shared pool what he thinks would make a fair share (for some twisted meaning of fair). The next player can then grab a set from the remaining loot, or relieve another player of his share (while returning one tile to the pool). This continues until everybody has a pile of loot in front of themselves.

Scoring is what is most reminiscent of Ra. There are various different symbols that are scored differently. Some award points for each tile collected, others make you lose points when you have the least, and yet others only score at the end of the game based on the size of the set collected by then.

Mammut is a nice lighter game, and suited for both family play and as a shorter game for more serious occasions. Despite the similarities it doesn't feel derivative at all. Still, on the whole, I slightly prefer the two games it reminds me of.

An interesting bidding mechnism combined with Knizia like scoring. Each round (of five) players select from a poole of 31 "prey" tiles which comprise food, fire, animals and other resources that your average caveman would need. The next player either also selects from the poole or grabs a previous player's tiles but must discard one tile back to the poole if he takes the second option. Once a player has selected tiles he waits for the scoring unless someone grabs his tiles of course in which case he must select again. The last player to select tiles gets starting player for the next round. Scoring is a mixture of points per something, plus or minus for most or least of something else, and a game end round of points for the variety of little fanged creatures you have collected. Components are good quality. Ok game but not much to it.

Players are mammoth hunters that have to share the prey (tiles). Each round, players either take a share of prey from the middle or from another player. This is repeated until every player has some tiles in front of them and scoring happens. 
Mammut has some clever ideas making it unique enough to warrant playing and owning it. Do you take a small selected amount of prey making it more probable that you'll keep your share or do you go for a big junk in the hope that other players are more interested in specific other tiles. Most of all, it's the 31 double sided tiles that are randomly thrown on the table leading to a different tile distribution each round. It's not a game for everybody. Players have to show some greed to make it interesting and not everybody will see the game here. But in the right constellation this is a good 30 minute filler game although in a too large package.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I am probably too generous in my rating, but I really like the idea behind the game.  I like games where players can get greedy, and greed (as well as shrewd evaluation) play a big role here.  The theme is ridiculous, but the game feels fairly unique.  There are many "I cut you choose" games, but I like the way you can take as much as you dare.  It seems like there are different ways to play - pure greed, aiming to get stolen from, targeting certain players...and there are a lot of different ways to score.  It's just so fun to chuckle about how many tiles a player is trying to take.

The only thing that I don't like about the game is the way it can drag out with too much stealing.  Also, the tool card that can force a player (or multiple players) to put back their tiles is dumb, mainly serving to lengthen the game.  I would choose to play without it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
This is a light, quick, fun negociation game. I normally dislike negociation, but this gives it a great structure: tiles are in the middle, and on your turn, you either take a part of the loot, or take somebody else's share, putting a tile back to the pot. We go around until everybody has a share, and of course, different tiles score in different way, not unlike in Ra.

One bad thing about this game is the theme. While it's cute, the gameplay would fit perfectly on a pirate or fantasy adventuring party theme. Yeah, we don't need yet another one of these, but if the theme is such a perfect fit, it's a sin to change it "just 'cause".

Although it is probably too much of a one trick pony to offer a lot of replayability, that one trick is a delight and will hopefully be reimplemented in heavier designs. Mammut offers a very clever spin on the I-divide-You-choose mechanism, with players grabbing self-alloted amounts of loot out of a central pile. On your turn, you can claim from the center what strikes you as a nice selection, or take everything that a previous player picked for yourself except (and this is where things get interesting) a single piece of loot that has to be returned to the central pile. As soon as somebody decides that the scraps left for him look more appealing than any of the other players’ stacks, he ends a round.

This ingenious idea is furnished with a couple of different scoring rules for the different kinds of loot and a couple of (very subtle) action cards that mainly change scoring rules for a round. Both serve to increase the tactical options by making the values of a given piece of loot more difficult to pinpoint and, more importantly, make them different for different players.

My doubts about replayability are the only other thing keeping me from giving this game a rating of 8; an additional nit to pick is that I don’t see why this could not have been a smaller package.

A set collection game where the sets are collected over 5 rounds and scored each round almost exactly like Ra is. But the auctions are replaced with a do-it-yourself process of tipping out the double-sided tiles, and picking out the set you want from the 30-odd tiles available. If you pick too strong a set, someone else will steal it, so you want to develop a niche where the set is valuable to you but not to the other players. It makes for some analysis paralysis, not only in the possibility of longish selection times, but in the analysis of other players' positions and likely postures. Or, don't care and just pick out 8 tiles that seem roughly fair to keep the game going. The more this happened, the more obvious it was that the game wasn't engaging enough to earn replay - too analytical, not enough fun. Nice to play once, don't need to play again.

It's basically a light push-your-luck game with a small element of negotiation, and you only really realise this after the first couple of rounds, which is how long it takes to really get your head round all the tiles and how to score points. You don't want to take too much, but you also need to make sure you aren't leaving the good stuff for everyone else! I'd definitely play it again, maybe with more people as I think the game would be quite different with four or five.

NOTE: I know the designer

Regardless of the stated fact, I really enjoy this game! I playtested this game numerous times and through various versions, and am satisfied with the Queen version, although I have played another version which I believe is even better!

To me the theme and gameplay supports each other and I truely find the atmosphere and choices fun and played with the right crowd hilarious. You don't want to play this with your die hard chess friends that have to analyze everyting and every possible outcome - play it fast and with your shoulders down! 

The game is much deeper than what you expect on face value. But I prefer to view this game as a fast, fun, filler that is not meant to be played too seriously. Just have fun and see how good you are at foolong your friends :-)

Upon first reading of the rules, I strongly doubted this game even worked. I was surprised to find a very fast and interesting light game. The question mark tiles are really what make this work, since a player will almost always be too curious to turn down all of the hidden potential. Definitely some luck involved, but perfect information would've killed it anyway.

This is a very unique game.  Not very deep at first but has some really interesting push your opponents into difficult decision type choices.  I can't say I have anything that this game reminds me of.  Maybe a little bit Ra but that is a stretch.  The theme is unfortunately very thin though.  Has very little to do with mechanics.  The game is simple take stuff that might give you points for the center  or your opponents.  Play cards that might give you or your opponents points but you don't know how things are going to turn out every round.  5 rounds is perfect for this game makes the game an hour w/ three which is just right for this game to not make it to redundant. This is another recent hit my Queen game in my opinion.  lighter than some of the more recent additions but I don't think there is another game out there that is all that similar.  the other thing going or it is that is quick to set up and break down and the rules are easy enough to pick anytime to play even if you have played in a while.   One down point to this game is that if you play with real analysis type people that this game can bog down.  Probably a game that is more enjoyable if you don't breakdown everything.   I actually wish this had a real time mechanic where choices are timed.

Tile choosing mechanic is original, but the point scoring is typical Euro.  I think the taking of tiles from other players will not sit well with typical Eurogamers.

Neat theme and kind of felt like a lite version of Ra.  Very thematic in scoring where Ra might not feel as attached.  I guess the only thing that took the game down a bit is the selection process -- while I think that after a few plays I could perceive it better, it seemed like it was just really, really difficult to get exactly what you wanted.  But some neat ideas here and a fun one!

Intriguing game of divide and choose with Ra style scoring.  I think it's a little too easy to analyze everyone's score to elevate it to a great game, but it's definitely fun.  It's strange that in theory a round could continue forever.  I'm in favor of a house rule to ban the "everyone throw their tiles back in" card.

I split you choose meets RA. Lovely to look at but the split part is tedious, just too many pieces to min max - then someone takes your pile and we start again. If it had less moving parts might be ok.

RATING: 7
Fun, fast game based around using the ol' "I cut, you choose" method of dividing the spoils as a kind of reverse auction -- a bunch of tiles are dumped on the table; you can either take as much as you want from what's left, or take all of the tiles that another player has already grabbed and return one to the centre. There is usually some back-and-forth when someone gets too greedy and their loot bounces around the table, diminishing each time until it ceases to be an attractive target. Once the tiles are all taken, you have some complicated Ra-style scoring which balances long and short-term scoring opportunities.

Rating could be higher if not for the potential for analysis paralysis to ruin everything. The game works extremely well as a thirty minute filler, but at sixty it outstays its welcome. The scoring has also proved too complex for the non-gamers I hoped would enjoy the core mechanism.

Pleasantly surprised by this variation on the I-divide-you-choose mechanic. The Ra-like scoring mechanism makes for intriguing choices about what good to take (but not so many choices it bogs everything down, I found; your game group may differ). I particularly like how you dump all the goodies out of a sack on the table -- like a caveman! -- then compete with each other for the spoils -- like a caveman!

I liked it a lot and think of it as "a quick ra with an elegant bidding mechanism and some take that element". I'm not quite sure if I really like the "take that" element (turning over the pet animals even if they are in the hand of another player). But after one play I'm a fan of Mammut. Unfortunately my wife is not. She is usually not a big fan of auction games but this on is a big miss in her opinion.

Played once.

Each turn there are 30+ Ra-like tiles from which players claim a share (as much as they want); a player can instead take another's share, if they sacrifice at least one tile back to the pool.

My first impression was rather dim as a "fair share" seems like a calculable thing, but only by doing some tedious arithmetic (including taking into consideration the current scores). Some unpredictability is introduced through question mark tiles (flipped to reveal a prize only once definitively won) and action tiles; the former are OK but the latter irk me because they introduce a hidden information component.

By the end of my first game I at least figured out the most important things to keep an eye on when picking out your share (and I also had house ruled the action tiles out of the game). What's intriguing is that if you do badly in a round, it mostly seems like it was avoidable and your own fault. The question mark tiles do throw this off.

Another thing that throws it off is the Shaman tile, which specifies a complete tiebreaker order based on who takes it. This is problematic because one player could steal the Shaman tile (along with the whole share) from a second player. The second player may be ok with it, and take his share from the pool. But other players who already have their shares may not be happy with the Shaman change, yet no longer have any say about the matter. I think it might be better to have specific tiles for each position in the tiebreaker, or just change how scoring works so that the tiebreaking isn't needed. [I have now played this way and think it's much better.]

...the BGG 2.0 weight rating seems too low, if you're playing this intelligently and to win...

...An interesting thing is that leader bashing (or any collusion) seems practically impossible. So if you have an unusually good turn, your advantage is basically banked.

Such a simple idea: A common loot to share pacifically but some pieces of the loot are unknown. Works wonderfully. Light and quick.

RATING: 8
Clever pie (tile) slicing game.  Where you take some (or all) tiles from the middle or all of another player.  I like that you just dump the tiles out and let them fall where they may.  All are double sided and different.

Rules are simple, and can be played 10 minutes after opening the box.  I see this appealing to gamers as a fun filler and non-gmaers alike.

I might be in the minority here, but I don't think it's bad with 2 players.

Mammut adds a twist to the familiar "I-split-you-choose" mechanism. Instead of just a split of the available choices, each player gets to pick from the central pile of tiles or steal existing piles previously chosen by other players. This means that players need to balance taking what they need and just a little more so as not to cross the threshold of being labeled "greedy" and hence, having their own piles stolen by others. Another clever design choice was to pour the tiles out from a bag and allow the double-sided tiles to land in any configuration. Since some of the tiles are only single-sided, the actual values or type of each tile can remain  unknown, thus introducing an element of risk in the selection mechanism. A very clever design that I have not seen before. Granted, the game is light in strategy and scoring choices, but this game was designed to be quick, light and not bogged down by overanalysis. Clever indeed.

Two plays. An interesting variation on the I'll-cut-you-choose mechanism (what would this be called? s'mine-no-mine-ok-keep-it-loser?).  This is what I call a thematic game: not pushing plastic figs and tracking hitpoints, but becoming a neolithic hunter-gatherer fighting over the day's spoils.  An attractive production by Queen, and you just have to love the sabre-toothed bunnies!

In this game you are splitting up the kills from the hunt. You either take tiles from the center or take the ones another player has already taken and put at least one back in the center. If you have tiles, you do nothing. the tiles all score differently so you may like a bunch of hides while someone else likes meat. It is a good group exercise on how to get the best but still leave enough for others.

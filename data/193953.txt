GAME: Mistfall: Heart of the Mists
RANK: 2932
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
As elegant as Mistfall, with some mechanical and thematic improvements. There's a slightly different balance, though - you have more powerful assists (allies, powerful treasure) than in the original, but the encounters are rougher; heroes are more interdependent and fiddly, but possibly more powerful too.

This expandalone amplifies all the weaknesses of the original game while failing to address its shortcomings. The badly designed cards with the tiny unreadable font and icons are back, but not the feel of adventure and the simple charm of the original. The game is further slumped down by a "fantasy taxes" phase, thanks to the new item store which paralyzes the game after every combat.

Streamlines some of Mistfall's clunker elements and adds interesting heroes and quests. Buy before the base game, but realize the game is intense and even overwhelming at times. Expect to break rules and lose often.

One of the current best fantasy co-op games I have played (in addition to Arkham Horror LCG) with high degree of variability as you experiment with different Heroes and their combinations, appreciate they dynamics of each have with each other.  Mostly used for solo-gaming.  Use of modular tiles enhances the replayability allowing you to revisit the same quests again.  Time Track system have been very much improved.

It's a very nice puzzle, but it's fiddly and cumbersome. Due to the combo nature of everything it's a hard sell as a coop, so this rating is for solo play. As a coop look at my rating of the original mistfall.

I love this and the original Mistfall. They are a fantastic solo experience, in my view. They offer a series of tight puzzles that require careful combinations of card play and different characters, encounters, locations, monsters and loot make for lots of variations. They scratch a similar spot to me as Mage Knight, but with a shorter play time, slightly smaller footprint and easier rule set to recall.

Unless you have a committed group who are willing to take many hours to learn their characters, the syntax and the ridiculous iconography, and who are ok with reading endless microscopic card text, this game is unplayable.

RATING: 5
There's a lot of good and interesting stuff here. The character variety and depth is superb. At the end of the day, though, it's just not worth wrestling with the game system itself. The rules are relatively straightforward--complaints in this area are dramatically overblown--but dealing with the deluge of conditional effects, special powers, card text, etc. etc. is more work than fun. Plus, some encounters are well-nigh unwinnable for certain groups, whereas others will be a cakewalk.
In a way, this is what Sentinels of the Multiverse might look like if it were more of an actual game; and I say that despite loving Sentinels and recognizing it's not much of a design. Mistfall just ends up being not worth it.

Clearly a streamlining of the actual problems (errata, rule book, etc) from the original/base game.  I truly believe that there is a great game hidden underneath some overly complicated design choices, not in terms of actual feature interaction, but in terms of the graphic size of icons, the small text which is difficult to parse at a glance, the italic keyword system.  I think if they could devise a way of implementing a Race For the Galaxy-style symbolic system, the same exact puzzles could be easier to read, and as thus, the fun part of the game (solving the puzzles/adventuring) wouldn't be quite the burden in terms of barrier to entry.

A fairly complex system that has a lot of replay value. I would love a much streamlined version of the game though.

Need more plays for a better impression and feel for the game.

Pure co-op standalone expansion for Mistfall. High fantasy adventure card game, with gameplay somewhat similar to LotR LCG, but each player is a single hero, and there is a simple (e.g. 3x3) map of locations. There are 5 quests in the box. 

Probably a bit heavy and long (2 hrs) for my tastes.

I absolutely love this game (Solo at least).  Lots of characters, lots of enemies/scenarios/locations, and a whole lot of replay ability.   

If I had to knock it for anything it is that there is a lot to setup at the beginning and the game can be slightly too long (with setup it's just over 2 hours average playing 2 characters.  Quite a bit shorter with just 1 character, but that takes a lot of the interplay between characters out.).

RATING: 7
Could have been a great game, if not for the dreaded dice box.  It constantly gets jammed and is really a very inelegant way to resolve combat.  I'd prefer to use standard A&A casualty rules (i.e. person losing the units chooses which).  Otherwise, good game.

I'll give this a tentative rating after a couple plays. I'm kind of waiting to see if some sort of sure win strategy comes out. But so far I've had a lot of fun with this game. It's abstracted from the actual conflict in the region but it does emphasize the crucial aspect that the movement of supplies played in this campaign. The combat works nicely, emphasizing the need for combined arms in naval task forces as well as land and air units. The need to commit to the movement of your units in a specific order is also nice and adds a great deal of tension to the process. It's also nice that there are pluses and minuses to being the first player. Being the 1st player is an advantage in combat usually but during movement the 2nd player gets to react to where the 1st player moves which is usually an advantage. It's evident that some effort was put into providing some balance. And speaking of balance, the optional rule tokens are a nice way to even up experienced vs inexperienced players and are a nice touch in a light game like this making it a nice gateway game.

Beautiful production that follows some innovations in combat resolution and supply found in the A&A:Bulge title. The "Designer's Notes" (a collection of reminiscences about the designer's father and his honorable service in the Solomons campaign) are disappointing as guides to the operational conduct of the actual campaign or insights into how the design/development team approached the subject and turning it into a commercial boardgame. However, the ongoing Developer's Notes (available online) that have accompanied the latest A&A titles prior to their release are excellent. After two plays.

I'm not a huge war game fan, but I find myself with the Acquisition Disorder to obtain all of the A&A series.

This is the most current game I've played, taking 5 sessions to complete 1 full game.  I played it with my 12-year old daughter.

There was nothing that wowed me about the game, but it was enjoyable, and wouldn't turn down another game.

Just acquired this after giving it a lot of thought.  So far, pretty good.  I have only one play, but I like the VP concept and the game is fairly easy to grasp.  Play is along the lines of other A&A games, although the combat resolution this time is quite powerful.   The only problem I have thus far is the strength of bombers in sea attack.  From all my reading of WWII Pacific, I never got the impression that bombers were all that threatening to ships.

This game has very little in common with the other A&A games; relatively short playing time; partly because of that making mistakes is almost irreparable, which leads to AP; besides, I have some doubts about the replayability, as the best way to play is rather fixed; considerable luck factor because of die rolling, but that does not matter

RATING: 9
The game is absolutely gorgeous to behold. The new cruiser pieces are really cool (make sure to contact WOTC to obtain a set in the correct colors - you can play with the ones that come in the box, but it's better to play with the correctly colored units). I will rate when I complete one game (to date, I've only played a partial game solo - not enough to rate). I will say that this is an Axis & Allies game in name and bits only - the ruleset is not at all like normal A&A, but is a true light wargame. 

Update (12/7/2007): My first game against a human opponent - GREAT GAME! This game has the mark of a great one, in that after the game, I am reviewing in my all the things that I could have done differently, and what I will try next time (and this, even though I won the game). The systems seems to faithfully model the furious sea battles, the costly air battles, and the slugfest land battles that characterized the campaign. It just feels right, and our first play only took two hours to complete, so this one is assured of repeat play. Most likely this is the best of the A&A battle games.

So far I love it and think it has the potential to go up after further plays.   The map appears too simple at first to provide for challenging decisions, but don't let that fool you an improperly placed ship or fleet can be devistating.  This is the first A&A game that I would call a true brain burner.  Larry great job on keeping the A&A Battle series fresh, I hope we see more in the future; I've heard rumors that Stalingrad is next (I'm hoping for Kursk).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 1
The map is the only thing good about this game. Even the pieces are your typical Axis & Allies fare. What is disappointing is the total lack of history in the game. D-Day is like Bulge which is like Guadal Canal. The fact that Hasbro produces these borg-like games one after the other is becoming absurd. There is no attention to detail. It's absurd for a gaming company to pidgeon hole your designs to one marketing name "Axis & Allies," a game system created by Milton Bradley thirty years ago and labeled under a defunt wargame publisher from almost a decade ago.  Adding little gimmicks to the game like the dice cartridge is childish. Hasbro should scrap the designer and take the Axis and Allies name and stop degrading it with these peices of crap. They should create new board games with historical purpose and drive.

RATING: 5
I appreciate the "zoomed in" aspect of the game (the whole board takes place in what would be a few normal sea zone spaces for a regualr game). The tedious part for me is having to move each unit type seperatly (it just became to fiddly for my tastes). 

Also, while the rolling box is clever, I don't like using it... The dice often dont fall into place nicely, You always have to lean over to check the other guys dice rolls, and it feels cheap. I'd much rather just roll some dice and consult a chart.

Oh well, nice try though.

Of all the battle/campaign games spun off from the original Axis & Allies, this is the best I've found.  It covers the Solomon Islands campaign (1942-early 1943) and not just Guadalcanal. The point system and novel logistics rules make this a great introductory-level wargame that's challenging for experienced wargamers, too.

Solid game, but a bit of a disappointment, mostly because naval units are expensive and move slowly. Add this to the proclivity for 'blobbing' and naval maneuvers become dull. I suggest allowing all naval units, except maybe submarines and transports, the ability to move two spaces. Either way, you really get a feeling for combined arms and the rules for supply and support tokens are welcome.

This game, while not bad, was slightly disappointing.  There are neat mechanics in the game, which I enjoy.  But the steady march of victory points makes the game seem artificially short and somewhat lackluster.  It's like one side wins and goes "Oh...I guess I won.  Huh."  

It needs just a few changes to make it very enjoyable.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Lots of fun and captures the feel of the Solomons campaign pretty well, in its A&A way.  I like the landing of troops on the islands and then slugging it out.  Trying to get the various islands supplied makes for some tough decisions.  I also like the fact that you may control an island but not all of the airfields on it, makes it interesting as reinforcements rush to the scene.  I also think the dice box is a cool idea.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Yet another variation of the Axis & Allies system.  This one places the emphasis on Naval and Air combat, to the point were infantry only plays a figurative role (majority dictates who "controls" the island).

Game appears to degenerate into a slugfest in the center of the board.  There does not appear to be much room for tactics, and the artilery piece, which is both used as a majority piece on land an a canon versus ships in adjacent sea zones, is way too powerful for its cost (2).

Will be playing this one again to see if my opinion will change (I have been playing A&A and its variants since 1981).

I was hoping to pick this up easily, but I found out all too quickly that this is a different game altogether, with the A&A coat of paint. I was not amused by how SLOW the game is now, with it's meticulous order of movements and constant bombardment of units from all sides. The dice box is a neat idea, but it's not something I wanted/needed for an Axis and Allies game where I found satisfaction rolling them myself. The map is gorgeous and the pieces are the same as before, but I was very disappointed in this game. Sold.

RATING: 10
I think this is by far the "Best" A&A adaptation to date! Great Job Larry and Co. Very intense battle situations and exciting finishes! I would have gave this a 10 but wasn't too crazy about the Battle Box being to clunky and noisey (I actually devised my own battle/dice system for it) and the Cruiser mishap was not too good either. AH (Sam) did a great job in getting the right pieces in my hands in no time though! Other than that, fun A&A game to experience! Can't wait for the next one: A&A:Stalingrad perhaps!?!?!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
After a dozen or so plays, we have found this game to be a lot of fun and quite replayable. My rating would be a 10 except for two things: First, its not very historical, but gives the "flavor" of actual campaign. Second, there's an IJN strategy ("5 Airfields") that can be tough to beat, though we have found it can be done. We tend not to follow this strategy to the letter because it can make for an unrewarding game. Recommended if you are not a slave to history and prefer trying out different stratgies.

Guadalcanal is a great tactical level A&A.  Its roll mechanics are significantly different from any of the world-wide A&A versions, and it's also limited in how long the game can stretch on (original didn't end until victory conditions were met, not this one).  

Like Battle of the Bulge, logistics is key to this version, which brings a realism to the game.  He (or she) who can keep their troops supplied will win.

Nice introductory wargame that an experienced grognard can start playing within 20 minutes of opening the box.  Players have a lot of choices over where to deploy forces, battle the enemy and dig in.  Players get points with which they can buy different types of reinforcements, thus ensuring lots of replayability.

The battle box is a little bit confusing at first, but the rules provide good examples and it gets easy to use once you've fought a few battles.

RATING: 7.5
I am enjoying the specific battle series of A&A games very much.  This game has quite a different feel from the A&A Bulge game.  There is plenty of opportunity for clever manuever and dramatic swings of fortune.  I happen to like the random casualty system provided by the much maligned Battle Box.  The fact that units which attack in more than one sphere (land, sea, air) can make multiple attacks per turn seems a little odd but I suppose the units that are capable are also of higher cost.  Airfields and carriers really play an important role in this game.  Very nice job in creating a simple wargame that is not in any way simplistic!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
NY - The dice box is an embarrassment to even think about. How could something so broken ship to customers? Dice in it cannot fully roll around and a D6 becomes a D4. The game itself had very little feel to what really happened and I could only stomach a single try. My friends had similar experiences. It would take me a lot (of beer?) to want to give this another go. I'd have to be in a strange mood.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
So far this might be the best A&A game (or at least variants) yet, balanced but dependent on your allocation of resources and deployment. Games seem to go back and forth and you have sweeping air, land, and sea battles. With Victory Points the game is short and does not take all day...try the game without VP's and take all the islands and see the battle rage.I ordered my replacement cruisers on the 19th and received them on the 24th! Now that's good service!All in all a great game so far

7/13/08: Rating of 7.5 after two plays.  The general A&A system really shows off well here, with the necessity of using land, sea, and air forces to their best effect.  An A&A game and so not really a simulation, it's still a fun game with a Solomons Islands theme.  The last-turn craziness to grab points is the one negative factor to me.  Otherwise, lots of fun.  If you feel like playing A&A: Pacific but don't have the time, play this one.

L'ordre du tour a semblé trop influent sur notre partie. Un tour sur deux on semble clairement (dés)avantagé par rapport à l'adversaire. Peut être nécessaire d'encore plus découper la phase de mouvement ? Ou alors utiliser la variante des déplacements cachés.

Impressed with the way they managed to "fit" Guadalcanal and surrounding areas into an Axis & Allies type game system.  Beautiful components.  Game play is fun and replays can allow for both players to trade sides within hours.

MUCH better than the original.  Many of the pieces are exactly the same, but there are many improvements.  First off, there is a time limit built into the game, which makes it last only a couple hours.  The dice box is a nifty addition as well.

Another variation in the line of Axis and Allies games. I have found the Allies tougher to play. The density of the board encourages action right from the start of the game. In some ways it reminds me of Avalon Hill's Victory in the Pacific.

Like how this finally got air and naval fit into AA format. Having 3 battles is bloody so attacks and defense has to be carefully planned. With a few number of turns - you can't wait too long however.

Like the concept behind the battle box - a forced allocation of hits but not the battle box it self.
Use one of the player aid documents and colored dice to allocate the hits.

I appreciate the designer notes, he has true treasure from his father.

What a great campaign version game for A&A fans and wargaming fans alike. This is extremely hard to find at a decent price, I honestly hope they reprint this one! Great balance and some new game specific rules and versions and mechanics. Great naval battles, airfields, destoyers making supply and transport runs, island hopping warfare, it's all here!

It's only two player and I have a lack of opponents for wargames, so this doesn't get to the table as often as I'd like.  Great combined arms game.

Well done A&A war game. An interesting war game that uses phased movement to try and keep both sides guessing. The battle box also helps with a random dispersion of hits to enemy units. Now, the defender does not always get to pick what gets hit. Good mix of war strategy, keeping your supplies moving forward, and purchasing. 

I really like my 1st face to face game as it came down the the wire... after all the huge sea battles, it was a marine over run of a Japenses air field that won the day.

After thinking about the goal in this A&A game, I think it's a pretty poor historical sim.  As an abstracted naval warfare game it's decent.  I'd play this again, but I realize that not only is the Axis and Allies dicey goodness (or badness) prevalent, there is also more of a sense of resource movement than actual warfare.  I think the thing that bothers me the most about this particular A&A installment is the victory condition.   In a battle to 15, there is going to be a chaotic point grab in the last turn, and this will often fly in the face of strategic logic.  I found myself throwing everything I had at the targets that would surprise the enemy most.  
Aside from these few misgivings, I did enjoy the game in spite of terrible luck (as Historical accuracy is not integral to my enjoyment)...  though if given the option I'd rather play an A&A land game like Battle for the Bulge...   (Im just not a huge fan of the Pacific theater, Tank battles are so much more romantic!)

My favorite of the A&A non-base games.  Very interesting mechanic, and setting up and protecting supply convoys being the central focus, something not oft seen in an A&A game.  Slightly unbalanced i feel, but still fun.

RATING: 7
[2 plays] I like the feel of this game much better than any of the other battle specific A&A games. Guadalcanal has strategic decisions at a level that D-Day and Bulge do not.

I think Larry and his team have worked out some very clever mechanics to make this game progress with:
* a somewhat realistic evolution of the conflict in this area
* keeping tension high
* allowing for easy tracking of movement in each phase
* not devolving over time into a board with only high value pieces remaining
* a very open decision tree that will preserve gameplay value over time 
* In short, they have learned well from their experience developing the previous games.

Guadalcanal in some ways feels like a specific zoomed in battle board for a macro game of A&A: Pacific, another game I regard highly.

Our games have taken from 3 - 3.5 hours.

Most recent play 4-9-09 with Garrett.

I love that they finally made a naval battle game. I agree with other commentors that I think this is the best so far, and that it is probably better said to be a game on the Solomons campaign rather than Guadalcanal. But of course Guadalcanal is much more recognizable.

Bought for about $26 Jan. 10, '09. First Axis & Allies game ever for me; never cared for what I had heard about the original game. This one plays quickly (under 2 hours easily): one read of the rules and I played my first game (solo) with little problems.

Ships are hard for me to distinguish; don't care too much for the dice box.But it does what I was hoping: a battle covering my favorite WWII locale that plays quickly and is not rules heavy - a nice change from the other WWI and WWII games I have.

In many ways this is not really an Axis and Allies game.  It uses the same pieces, but fundamentally different mechanics.  It took me awhile to understand it, because you keep thinking that it will be more like Axis and Allies than it is.

Its the best Axis and Allies branded game that I have played.  Quite clever and very thematic.  An overlooked game.

A pretty good member of the Axis and Allies family.  Two-player, easy to learn, a bit longer to play than the rules claim (4-6 turns my foot!), but a lot of fun.  Not too historical in gameplay, perhaps, but a very good game nonetheless.  Great fun.

A faster playing A&A game which is great when you have a hankering for a game, but don't have 4 hours to play. However, the battle box is goofy, in a bad way. If you have the time, FLAT TOP is so much better!

RATING: 7
That dice box really works!  This is the A&A flavor that I'm most willing to play.  A&A: Guadalcanal is quick to set up, there aren't a MILLION sculpts, and the combat resolution system is effective (easily 2nd best is the whole series).  The original is the most satisfying, but if I don't have days to play it, this is my next choice.

Haven't played this extensively, but I am not convinced.  My impressions are mixed, with significant reservations.  There are really not that many die rolls, and a few of them are disproportionately important, which means that if you get lucky bombing an airfield, or taking out a capital ship, you have a significant advantage.  The US has a disadvantage early, with the need to take a whole lot of islands in order to even the playing field.  To do this, they have to rely on a fleet that is even with the Japanese fleet, and an air force that's only a little better.  Seems like the Japanese can build up airfields and play defensively, and the US will have a difficult time trying to break that.  The air units, given that they fire on sea units after getting fired at, are not very useful over the sea in large battles.  Given competent play by Japan, seems like a tough row to hoe for the US, but I'd be interested in playing a few more times to solidify my opinion.

A somewhat abstracted treatment of the battles around the Solomon Islands in WWII.  The game is accessible to newbies in the wargaming realm.  A nice variation on the A&A combat model with a unique dice box for determining battle hits.  The game does give the ebb and flow feeling of island combat and control of critical airfields thereon in the Pacific.  A worthy addition to the A&A battles series.

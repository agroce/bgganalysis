The game is basically an excuseto tell absurd stories with a faux british accent.

The point I awarded just reflects the mechanics which are sound, but not terribly exciting.

As soon you play it with the right group, the value of the game goes up to 9

Better than Captain Park's Imaginary Polar Expedition, which it updates and improves.

Amusing set collection similar to Just Desserts.  Storytelling is encouraged but not required.

RATING: 8
A remake of Captain Park's Imaginary Polar Expedition. This is a fun, light game with the Cheapass sense of humor. It can pull in some players who will enjoy the story-telling aspect as much or more than the game itself.

I love this game. Love the fake exploring, and the cards allow almost everyone to spin an amusing yarn.
We ham it up...shouting, "GENTLEMEN! YOU WILL NEVER GUESS WHERE I HAVE BEEN!" when we return to the club.

A very fun game. It took a couple of turns to get the flow of the game down, but it moved quickly once we had it. Scoring at the end was very close for a 3 player game.

RATING: 6.5
Good as an entry-level story telling game, when using a variant of making up your own stories based on the cards. If not for that, it's an ok set collection game.

* Kickstarted! *

Move your token from card to card to collect artifacts needed to tell a story at one of the locations that match it. Better artifacts improve your score. If you run into the villain, though, you must give up an artifact.

PLUS: easy to learn, fast play
MINUS: more interesting with storytellers, a filler game more than a destination game

This game is hilarious. The artwork and flavor text on the cards certainly adds to the overall feel of the game. The game is easy to learn and would be good for a family game. Not gonna lie, my favorite card is the fact card: Noodles Are Tasty. (Mmm, noodles!)

Wife's Copy. The Wife and I are huge fans of Prof. Elemental, and I was surprised at how fun this little party game is. You play Explorers, who have never left London, who weave elaborate lies about their adventures. If Professor Elemental catches you collecting your fake evidence you have to start over. We play with the special house rules that you have to actually tell your fake experiences (in a funny accent) in order to get your points.

Thinner mechanics than Captain Park, all very cleanly done but it makes the luck aspects all the more obvious. And "month tokens" were a great mechanical joke in the original.

Played a PnP. Easy to explain and a decent bit of push-your-luck. Table enjoyment really benefits if you go out of your way to craft a ridiculous story (with a ridiculous pseudo-British accent) to link all of your fake evidence together back at the club.

RATING: 7
This game is a filler, but it is a Cheapass game and for that reason alone, deserves to be played. Hilarious. It captures the mood and atmosphere of the theme, and is just all around fun. The cards themselves are funny too, but only one or two should be read at the conclusion of an adventure or the game will drag too long. Don't plan on a lot of repeat plays unless you like the same jokes over and over again, like Munchkin or Killer Bunnies.

This game in my opinion is really fun. However, it is not for a small group. It has to be played with at least 5 people. That way it increases the pace of the professor going around.

If you get into the theme and use the cards to tell the wild adventures you had in the various places using the cards as inspiration this will be a pretty fun game... most of the cards are pretty funny, some are hilarious, others not so much :p

It's a very simple game mechanical but with the right people it can be pretty cool

Your mileage really depends on how much you like the theme and how into the storytelling aspect of crafting ridiculous adventures your group is.  Beyond that, there's not much game here.  I wanted to like it more.

The story-telling aspect leads to some crazy tales, but often devolve into "I traveled to [Location] for [object] and encountered [obstacle], [obstacle], and [ally] saved me" after a while.  The mechanics are fairly simple, which I like for ease of teaching, but an early misstep can leave you with a point deficit you can't come back from and a prolonged game ahead of you.  This leaves me cold, as I dislike playing games where the end-game is still a long time off but the ending is already decided.

This is purely based on playing with 2 players; I can see it playing very differently with more players.

RATING: 3
I had high hopes for this but the gameplay itself requires minimal intellectual activity and is, frankly, downright boring - it's pretty much just move and draw. The only high point is in crafting a story from the cards you've collected when you turn them in, but this occurs far too infrequently to make waiting for it worth the time you've spent getting there. Also contains some mildly racist elements of the 'a couple of unaware white guys thought this trope would be funny' sort. The art on the cards is nice. Traded.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Actually own the PnP version after the KS, but it's a great fun if relatively simple almost party/social game as there's a good fun element to it if everyone is up for a bit of storytelling to link their preposterous cards together when they get back to the club.

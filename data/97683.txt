Excellent, likely to be a 10.

Love the tension between gaining partners for greater dividends and diluting endgame scoring. Love that you can't take the same action twice (minus expand). Love the super tight area around the red opening. A lot to love, can't wait to get the group up to a high level of play on this one.

Okay. I'm a huge and devout Winsome fan. I buy pretty much anything John Bohrer puts out. It is almost all good as far as I am concerned. But I almost passed this out-of-nowhere, not-quite-a-reprint/not-quite-a-new-game. I have Pampas. I have Veld. 'Why do I need this?' I asked. Well, I'm glad I got it.

This one plays a lot like Veld Railroads, a Winsome backlist game that got a small reprint last year, but the change in the number of dividends - both regular (from 8 to 6) and special (no more company-to-company special dividends) - make the game much sharper. Our first couple of plays were with four which frankly seems like it might be the best; it is a great mix action control of a lower player count with the rich incentive mesh of a higher player count. Several plays with three confirm that it is probably a better three player game than Pampas Railroads, although it doesn't really shine there. The action selection mechanism here is what sets the game apart from Pampas and Wabash (aka Chicago Express). Instead of three actions to choose from with one evenutally becoming unavailable, the actions are available as long as there is space (players occupy the spaces work-placement style). Instead of dividends happening at relatively regular intervals, 'pay dividends' is an action that is available for one player (who will occupy it until their next turn). The cycling in and out of the shares and dividend boxes happen rapidly enough to hand the players pretty brutal tools and create violent uncertainty. While a direct descendant of Pampas, the fragility is much more akin to Wabash. But the controls in Wabash are more indirect - null actions, develop actions to kick the turn order, a clock that ticks pretty steadily but for a group-determined period. Veld's clock jerks and berks, making bets on game length - forced or chosen - just outright uncomfortable.

Pampas meets Veld Railroads, but simplified.  There are still 6 companies, one which launches based on a later connection, 5 shares per company, etc but the possible action mix and the action costing has changed a bit, and with pervasive effects.  

This is a game I could easily see playing in 20 minutes...or 2 hours.  A given play group will likely rapidly normalise to a predictable play-time, but should the players wander out to other groups they'll likely find highly variant playtimes as the group renormalises to the new gestalt of assumptions.

The decision granularity is oddly large in SAR, leading to almost indigestibly densely textured decisions.  It is chewy stuff.

Updated: Too much is lost in the compression in comparison to Pampas Railroads.  Rating normalised to 8.5.

Updated: Pushing back up half a point due to subtleties in the action choices I'd not previously observed.

Winsome does it again.

An optimistic initial rating.  May be subject to some flux but I doubt it.  A very very interesting design that can be explained in five minutes and played well in forty--though, in a tight enough contest I could see this stretching out into a delicious 90 minutes.  When  I get a few more plays in I may feel comfortable to write up a review or some session reports.  

Update:  A good game with 3 but even better with more.

SAR is a re-development of Veld Railroads, and is something of an unusual blend of the older Winsome sensibility with that of the newer, more stripped-down style. Thus, the Prairie stock scheme (5 shares, only those in control can choose where the builds go, rails create value in addition to income that pays out at the end of the game) continues here, and this game will be very easy to pick up and play for anyone who has played any of the modern [[Prairie Railroads Series]].

Veld Railroads was the chromey, sister game to Pampas Railroads. Though it twisted the action selection mechanism, the primary thing that differentiated it to me was the heaping piles of chrome: state borders, special rules for the ZASM, &c. SAR goes back in the opposite direction, and strips the game back to its essence. The number of dividends is shorted (which means the Pay Dividends action can even more dramatically shorten the game), and all of the extra chrome is taken back out of the game.

This is an enjoyable title, and for those who find it impossible to get the slightly longer Pampas and Veld onto the table I can see the charm. However, I don't think the action selection mechanic itself is enough for to justify having another game in the Pampas mould. I personally prefer the original incarnation to this newer title, though I would never refuse playing someone else's copy, and certainly think that this one, of all the extant titles, has the best chance of being picked up by a larger firm. The primary hurdle that I still see with that is the gamey but important concept of value that dictates the end-game payout. I think this is an extremely important mechanic in terms of creating interesting decision space, but it's hard for people to wrap their heads around initially.

In SAR players buy shares in railroad companies and extend their network in order to drive up company income and dividends.

The action selection mechanic creates some interesting dilemmas since you cannot take the same action twice in a row, and actions are further limited by the number of players selecting them. One available action is dividend payment which at the same time also doubles as the game clock. By choosing this action players can end the game brutally quickly if they so desire.

A simple game rules-wise, yet quite a bit of meat to its (expectedly spartan) bones.

BARE edition, for play with Pampas Railroads (2011) pieces.

The rules of S.A.R.R. streamlines some of the phase choices of Pampas RR, and apparently removes a lot of historic chrome from Veld Railroads, leaving the core of a true Winsome game- economic driven, Train themed, tight, interesting and competitive.

I think I like the choices here more than Pampas RR, but need to reply both to get a better feel and actaully place an initial rating.

Another excellent release from Winsome, though.

Lots of depth and decisions in a few rules. This needs a reprint or at least a print-on-demand option. Playtime varies from 40 minutes to two hours.

This game is very similar to Veld Railroads, but with the special round effects and special payouts removed. It definitely shortened the game (6 rounds now) and made it feel like Pampas Railroads with the lower certainty about when the rounds would end of Veld. While still a good game, this stripped down version took away much of the sizzle/texture and strategic possibilities of Veld, so I'd always rather play Veld than this game.

While I enjoy Winsome's hex-based Historic Railroad system which most of its recent releases belong to, South African Railroads is a pleasant diversion with its point-to-point network. It fits in the same slot as Chicago Express time- and complexity-wise but I feel that there's more variance in the way it could play out and it's not as susceptible to being thrown off rails by irrational/inexperienced player decisions. I like the valuation part of shares at game end which adds a lot to the depth of the game and which we gave consideration much too late in our first game.

Excellent. This is not Wabash! What you learned from that game doesn't apply here.

I was the first person to order this from Winsome Games after it was announced.

Suggest.

Quite a simple game, despite my reservations (I get scared by train games). Get a variety of shares, build were it counts...over in an hour. Nice one! Rating could get up if you could really play in 40 minutes.

--May2011-- Crunchily intriguing: some of the subtlety of Pampas Railroads, in a shorter game where tempo is significant.  The action selection constraints quickly become surprisingly interesting.  Very enthusiastic to play again.

Excellent game. This is my second favorite Winsome (behind Chicago Express/Wabash Cannonball). The game is quick, fun, and filled with meaty decisions. The production quality is standard Winsome, although I don't mind that at all. I quite like it!

I enjoy the way the end game payouts are designed. It forces you to be thinking about each railroad's end game value, as well as their turn to turn value. The off-board boxes can cause some massive swings in income for players if careful attention is not paid to companies within striking distance of them. 

I cannot say enough good things about this game. Time will tell if it can hold my interest over the long haul (like Chicago Express), but I have a feeling it will.

1 play, 3er, aborted early after it was clear that one player had made significant overbids early and another was nigh uncatchable.

A pretty unforgiving game similar to Pampas Railroads in many ways, but also pretty different. Apparently it is closely related to Veld Railroads, but I haven't played that game before. So mostly I'm comparing this to Pampas.

There are 5 companies (and a 6th that opens later, when Johannesburg is added to a company's network) each with 5 shares, one of each auctioned at the beginning of the game. The game is driven by players choosing actions -- offer stock (this time, though, you can sell your own share as well as capitalize a company), build track, develop a location, or pay dividends (a new option, I think). The action selection method is pretty clever, although slightly fiddly: you choose an action (different than the one you took last turn) by moving your token to the action selection box. Each box, though, is different: only one player may be in the Pay Dividends box, 2 in the Develop box, 3 (or 2 if player 3er) in the Offer Shares box. Construct track is different -- any number of players may go there, and may also be chosen in consecutive turns. Each action marches the counter on the Action Track -- this is the slightly fiddly part -- forward a different number of spaces; when reach/pass 35, pay dividends and reset the counter. The 6th dividend, calculated from the railroads VALUE (basically, its assets = $5/link + value of connected external markets; value/shares outstanding, paid to each shareholder) whereas the first five are related to railroad INCOME (which increases as the network connects to various types; pay income/5 to each share sold).

The rules are really pretty straightforward. Gameplay is pretty tight -- spending too much early means you'll get shut out of opportunities later ... it doesn't seem as if there's much likelihood of catching up. I really do like the action selection mechanism, though.

A railroad may build a double link that terminates in Johannesburg and a railroad may build a double link that originates in Johannesburg, but a railroad may *not* build a double link through Johannesburg.

Fantastic and interactive cube rail game. Lots of opportunities for tactical track laying and temporary partnerships. Auctions are fierce as only the majority holder can lay track for a company.  Excellent.

Feels pretty similar to Pampas. It's shorter, it gives a player who thinks they're in the lead the ability to instantly advance to the next dividend payout, the action constraints are different (mostly reduced, was my feeling), and the railroads are building from the outside towards the center, instead of from a common point outwards.

Two of the five initial railroads are surprisingly easy to cut off if no one's paying attention. I know Veld had a couple of one-ways that were removed for SAR, but even those don't look to me like they would have helped.

I'm still bothered by the question (as in Pampas) of whether (or why) I would auction off a share if everyone knows what it's worth and most everyone can afford it. One thing about SAR that makes this bother me less is that action depletion within a round is mostly based on a point system, so that if nobody wants to take a certain action, they don't have to.

I don't usually play these kind of games and was kinda lost at the start. Somewhere in the middle it just clicked and by the end I really wanted to play it again, now knowing how to play! :)

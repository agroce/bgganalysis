RATING: 5
I'm a heretic; I'd rather play this than 7 Wonders as it scratches that drafting itch with an easier setup, scoring, or and a fraction of the time. Teaching it is also superior to 7W and I can get all sorts of people who aren't interested in 7W to play courtesy of the easy play and cute cards. The largest bummer (and a similar ding on 7W) is that you only pass right once compared to the two to the left, so the PR/Seat order problem sort of exists, but it's not as great as it is in Puerto Rico.

Soy Sauce promo is solidly worth adding.

Sushi Go is a game I wanted to love, but truly, I just couldn't find enough in it to interest me. Sushi Go is a simple card drafting & set-collection game, which does make it simple enough even for children, but also makes it a game I wouldn't actually want to replay. It is a decent game - it works, it's fast, it's cute. However, it just falls short of actually being fun for me. Update: liking it more with more playthroughs, updating rating. Update 12/13/17: Liking it a little more, updating it again. Best drafting game in my collection? No. But I have grown to like it for its purity & speed of play.

Another gentle card game in my collection, cute and completely approachable. And again, makes no pretense to be anything other than just that. Here you pick cards, and pass the rest, trying to get the right sets to score. It's very fun - a passing fancy and nearly the definition of light filler. Fluffy and frothy - no weight whatsoever. But for that, a great introduction to drafting as a mechanic.

Oh, I love card drafting. In this game however, I wish there was a bit more variety to the cards or combos. I understand that the designers have wanted to keep the game rather simple, but still a cunning twist or two wouldn't have hurt. Quite enjoyable, still.

Usually I do not mind the theme in card games of this kind. In SushiGo however, the theme was a tad repelling. I love sushi, and I love humorous themes, but somehow it just didn't work here. This is a minor niggle though. This is a good game for casual occasions.

Eldest daughter R was jazzed about this after playing at her middle school game club, so I picked it up for Hanukkah 2014. Nice, fast, light filler that plays great with kids. High marks on that regard. Probably less great with gamers, but maybe not bad with non-gaming adults. Can you push it to 6p? R says so, might be worth giving it a try.

I'll rate it an 8-9 with kids, maybe a 6-7 overall. Nice job, Gamewright.

Sushi Go is a cool filler and a great gateway for drafting games, because for its simplicity it can be played by everybody. The Gamewright edition has also very cute artwork, that works well with kids and non-gamers. 

The game in itself is extremely simple, but it's absolutely enjoyable too. In a nutshell Sushi Go is basically a portable 7 Wonders light, because a lot of its mechanisms are the streamlined version of those you find in Bauza's masterpiece. Sushi Go might not be very original then, but for sure it's solid, although not as replayable as its big brother, because it doesn't have the same variety.

I played Sushi Go with my wife and she was confused and unimpressed through the first two hands(courses). I watched the TableTop before we played but she didn't.

после второй партии стало ясно, зачем на двоих предлагают ввести виртуального игрока: на известных наборах карт у каждой рассчитываешь свою фактическую стоимость, и играть становится неинтересно. 

попробовали с виртуальным игроком. 
да, добавляется небольшой элемент неизвестности, но в целом всё равно уныло. плюс ещё начинаешь путаться, где чьи карты и кто куда что откладывает.

In the super-fast sushi card game Sushi Go!, you are eating at a sushi restaurant and trying to grab the best combination of sushi dishes as they whiz by. Score points for collecting the most sushi rolls or making a full set of sashimi. Dip your favorite nigiri in wasabi to triple its value! And once you've eaten it all, finish your meal with all the pudding you've got! But be careful which sushi you allow your friends to take; it might be just what they need to beat you!

Drafting + set collection.

I like it better than 7 Wonders, since it's less fiddly and presents itself as an abstract strategy, instead of pretending to have a theme. But I don't really view set collection as an particularly interesting scoring mechanism, so neither game does much for me.

But it does play well and is easy to teach. There's not much to hate. You'll lose to anyone who can remember all the cards he passed around.

After ten plays I still enjoy the game. It's a light game for sure and easy to teach. The game has three rounds and after the first round most players should have a good idea of how the game works. Played this with three non board gamers in the staff room. All three of them immediately went online and bought it which I think attests to the accessibility of the game and how much fun it is. It's a short game and after the first game people will normally ask to play again.

Card drafting stripped down to the absolute basics.  It works OK, but there isn't quite enough going on. I try to build the highest value sets I can with the available cards and I try to avoid passing high scorers to the player on my left.

Lo malo que por eso mismo se quemará rapidillo; pero por el precio al que se puede encontrar merece la pena.

The goal is to grab the best combination of sushi dishes as they whiz by. Score points for making the most maki rolls or for collecting a full set of sashimi. Dip your favorite nigiri in wasabi to triple its value. But be sure to leave room for dessert or else you'll eat into your score! Gather the most points and consider yourself the sushi master!

RATING: 8
All of the intricacy of 7 Wonders in a tiny, stupidly-cute package. 

On its own, this little card game is a blast. The scoring is very intuitive, the hate drafting is real, and the great satisfaction of the end game is very thematic. In 7 Wonders, I never appreciate the "empire" I've built when scoring occurs... but in Sushi Go! I sit there and salivate over the platter I've just constructed.

I once made a giant pot of chili for friends and family who came over for a night of games. We opened the evening with three games of Sushi Go! and immediately put the chili in the fridge and ordered $85.00 of sushi. It was magical. 

Seriously, though, I think every collection should have Sushi Go! It's a real gem. Tempura for days, people/

It's a decent game, but it's really light. In my plays I didn't bother to think about my choices. You really just have to decide if you want to block the person next to you or not. In a 5-player game, if you block, both of you will probably lose.

It'll be a decent filler while waiting for more players to start a game night. Nothing more.

This is a great light, fast, fun game that non gamers can get into. I could play this with my grandparents and still have fun. It features two things that I love: card drafting and set collecting. There is also an excellent 2 player variant under "variants" in the forums. Try it out!

Nice, fun pass and play card drafting title where you score different amounts of points for different combos of foods, and there are other cards also which can help affect the scoring each round, and some you save 'til the end of the game. Cute tin, amazingly cute artwork, and I find the theme here matches the drafting mechanic more than something like 7 Wonders where I feel it just moves too fast for these legendary monuments.

RATING: 7.1
7 wonders stripped down to its very essence, with cute artwork. It's too minimal to be very interesting as a 2-player game, but still fun with more, particularly for such a short play time. The one improvement over 7 wonders in this game is that not all cards will participate in each game, and that there's no separate deck for each round, and so card distribution is always uncertain.
Tends to be a very well received by non-gamers we introduce this to.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Very simple card-drafting game with set-collection... think of it as a light-version of 7-wonders. Overall, it creates a fluid experience but there really isn't much depth here. As a gateway game, perhaps this is a title to check out. But to me, it feels more like an activity than a game.

Sushi Go is a drafting game, distilling the concept to its core. It is 7 Wonders without all the complexity, barren to the bones.
This doesn't mean it is a bad game: in 20 minutes you can have a light and fun game, that players can enjoy without too much thinking, but with some decisions.
At first it seems almost flat, but it packs a surprising lot of game in few minutes! The first outing my group played it 4 times in a row...

There's more of a game here than meets the eye.  Your decisions are often "Help my neighbor and I or hurt my neighbor and I."

It was a hit with all people I introduced it to, but sometimes the game can get so quick that it feels almost hectic at the table. The latter is a state I don't enjoy that much.

The game is a solid stepping stone to introduce the principle of card-drafting which can then be re-used for 7 Wonders, a family-favourite.

Borrowed from library. 3 playthroughs. Played with 2 players. Simple set collection game with special requirements for each type of ingredient (eg collect most pudding to gain 6 points, least pudding is minus 6 points). The games OK. Nothing to write home about.

A lovely family card game.  Even as a stripped down version of 7 Wonders, it succeeds on many fronts.  Easy to teach, easy to play, and easy to play again.  Once new players get the hang of drafting, they are usually down for a second game.

An out-of-the-park winner. I've taught this to children; I've taught this to my 60-year-old parents. Everyone loves this game. I cannot think of a better introductory card game than this. The theme perfectly matches the mechanics, the game is quickly played in 15-20 minutes, and most of all, it's fun. Buy this game!

I love Fairy Tale, but I have yet to teach it to my family because I feel like there are a lot of little rules intricacies that might take them a little time to comprehend, especially when they've never played a drafting game before. Well, Sushi Go is a superb way to ease them into the basics of drafting. It has all the interesting decisions that you find in other drafting games, but with extremely simple scoring and powers on the cards to make it a good entry-level game. I hope to eventually move beyond this to Fairy Tale, but for now I can have just as much fun with this game.

Sushi go is much loved, and for good reason. Cute aesthetics and a simple drafting mechanism allow this game to be played by gateway and serious gamers alike. At this point I would recommend the party version for your own collection, but as a gift to someone who doesn't play games that often, the simplicity of the original still makes it a good idea.

Super quick set collection game with the feel of Seven Wonders.  Hyper cute artwork, everyone that tries it wants to play 'one more time'.  Easy to teach and just a bit of strategy.  This is a game I can get my non-gamer friends to play.  Love it.

RATING: 7.5
A fun drafting card game. I initially rated this quite highly but lowered it a bit after several plays. 

I like that each of the types of card score differently, but I feel like the decisions are almost always tactical and not strategic. Given the similar playtime I'd usually choose 7 Wonders (and expansions) instead, though that game requires a lot more time to teach.

Played this for the fist time on International Tabletop Day!  I went to an event at a local game store, and the owner demoed this one for my and my friend.  We were so impressed, that my friend went home and pre-ordered it that same day... even though it wouldn't come out for another couple months!  It was just delivered to him a few days ago, and we've already played it several times!  Such a quick, easy, fun game.  Easy to learn, fast gameplay, and never boring.

Quick, simple, card drafting 'filler' game.  Good for casual gamers.

Great packaging too. Small metal tin (durable) that is JUST big enough for the game, not a ridiculously large cardboard box in comparison to the components.

You need some space for play, but this could even be a bed (you're just laying cards now) and it an excellent for a travel game due to its compact size.

We have really enjoyed this little card game! It has been a lot of fun. It's very easy to learn and a game you could teach to almost anyone. The game is definitely more fun the more players you have.

The premise is that you are dealt a hand and you pick a card from that hand. Then you pass your hand to the next person and get the hand from the person next to you. Play continues on until there are no more cards to pass, then points are tallied up.

The game is quick. I would say our average play time for one game is about 15 minutes.

I recommend this to anyone who wants to play a quick card game that doesn't have a ton of rules. It's also a great game if you have kids, or are wanting a game to play with kids, because it's easy to learn and the artwork is cute.

I don't like sushi; but I love this game.  This is a must bring for every game session I attend and it is always well received.  For many people, it is there first introduction to the drafting mechanic and has often found instant success and requests for repeated plays.  This little filler often ends up with enough plays to account for the time that we would have spent on a 'heavier' game.

I feel like I'm the only person who doesn't like this. :/ It's cute, and the arts adorable, but the card drafting isn't my thing when there are so few card options, and I never seem to manage to make decent sets. I'm sure I'm just bad at drafting, but it's spoiled me on wanting to play it. Would rather play Fairy Tale as it has more strategy and variety, with a much wider variety of cards and set options. It makes for a more lively game- willing to try the newer version of Sushi Go! that has more cards.

What a cute little game.  This game is a blast.  Cute artwork, maybe 10 minutes a game with four anyway.  Super easy to learn and teach.  A lot of player interaction, not knowing whether to screw over your neighbor or help yourself through clever card drafting mechanism.  You reveal picked cards as you are picking them so everyone knows what you have and what they have to beat.  Really fun I will play anytime.

A quick pick-up game for non-game players and fairly young children (8+). I'd take it over UNO any day if only for the definite time/turns of play. Bright and colorful cards add to the fun of the game. The one hang-up in most early plays is familiarizing ourselves with the chopstick and its use. A good party game.

RATING: 6
Sushi Go is a stripped down drafting game with a Sushi theme.  There are only a few types of cards, which leads to rather anemic decisions.  Usually the "best" card to take is fairly obvious, although each of the types has some risk associated.  

This is an acceptable filler for playing with non-gamers.  I got tired of it very quickly, but would play if others wanted to.  It is easy to teach, and plays very quickly.  For less than $10, it's well worth picking up for playing with my in-laws.  But I'm not going to get excited about playing it.

Turns out I'm not a big fan of games that are played in more or less distinct rounds (i.e., where the conditions are identical and nothing substantive carries over from the previous round).

Un juego de draft (una mecánica que me gusta bastante) que se explica en 5 minutos y se puede jugar en cualquier sitio. La rabia de quedarte con dos sashimis mientras tu rival se está llenando de gyozas no tiene precio.

RATING: 6
A super simple drafting/set collecting game.  If you took a game like 7 Wonders and simplified the heck out of it, you get Sushi Go.

Players are dealt a hand, take one card, and pass the rest, doing this over and over until all the cards are played for the round.  They then score the cards played.  Some cards score only if you played 2 or 3 of them, some score if you played more of them than anyone else, some just score the printed value on them, etc.

Most point after 3 rounds wins!  Overall, just a really simple drafting game that anyone could learn in a few minutes.

It's 7 Wonders but you don't have to memorize all the various sets because all the information is on the cards themselves. I never felt like I was doing anything interesting. Just collecting cards in the hopes that my matching cards would either be available in this round, and if they were, that they would be ignored enough by the other players that I would get points from this set.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Love the artwork. The gameplay, a quirky mix of 7 wonders and sort of Ra-like scoring, was fine. I am rating it a seven because it is a great family and non-gamer game (and a decent introduction to card drafting). 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a great lighthearted game, although there is some player interaction in the form of blocking opponents. The art and simple gameplay create a relaxed atmosphere. I’m pretty sure all of the 20+ people that I’ve played with have asked to play a second game. 

The scoring system is simple, but sufficiently complicated that a kindergartener would probably never win against thoughtful adults, although they may get lucky for a round.

RATING: 6
I love the drafting mechanism in 7 Wonders, so naturally I had to get this tiny game. It comes in the standard 2-deck card box size like Coloretto and Fairy Tale; the latter is another drafting game, but one which I eventually found lacking compared to 7 Wonders. If you’ve played either 7 Wonders or Fairy Tale, you’ll know that those games play very quickly… But I’m actually able to play a game of Sushi Go in the same amount it takes to explain the rules for 7 Wonders! Yes, it’s that short! 

However, this isn’t necessarily good; while it is an “okay” filler, it lacks some meat to the gameplay. It is basically just a very simple form of drafting and has much more luck going on than 7 Wonders I feel. I guess the major reason for this is that not all cards are included in every play, so you never know which cards are included in each of the 3 rounds; this means that you have to gamble on whether specific cards are going to appear in each round. This is especially devastating if you pick for instance a Sashimi as your first card only to then realize that there are not 2 other Sashimis in the deck; and if there are, other players might have gone for a Sashimi as their first card too (the card gives 10 points if you have 3 of them, 0 points if less)… Then you’re basically screwed by no fault of your own. Other players might “hate draft” and pick a Sashimi just so you cannot get the third one, but if you’re playing with 4+ players that’s hardly a winning strategy as you don’t get points yourself… 

The cards I do like include the chopsticks and the wasabi cards; they add a nice extra layer of strategy. The chopsticks can be a great early pick as you can use it later on to get two similar cards (sashimi comes to mind) or a wasabi and a squid nigiri – just remember to use it before it’s too late as there are a lot of crappy hands in the end of the game! I think it’s cool that the wasabi card triples the value of one of your nigiri cards which can suddenly make those cards very viable to play and net you lots of points. Finally, the pudding cards are neat; I like the fact that there are some endgame bonus scoring cards. Speaking of the end; I think the end of each round is often kind of lame – it’s very rare to score many points on the last card simply because the better ones have already been taken (yes, that can also happen in 7 Wonders, but there you at least have the ability to discard it for gold or perhaps even use it as part of your wonder).

Ultimately, I’m not sure this game will stay in my collection (I tend to sell most games I’ve rated below 7). It’s a filler, but I’d rather play No Thanks or some other filler if I only have 5-10 minutes. And if I want to get the drafting feeling, I would much rather play 7 Wonders as it’s also a very quick game but is vastly superior in depth.

A super light drafting/set collection game with nice artwork.  Plays quick, easy to teach, and has a light amount of strategy in the drafting (do I play this one to help me, or play this other one to hurt you?).  Strategy changes as well with the number of players.  I've played with 2-4 and it works well with any number.  However, you'll def need a "dummy" player in a 2p game.

Small and portable - easy to grab on the way out the door or when traveling.  While the tin case is cool, it does often pop open very easily.

A light card drafting game of set collecting with a sushi theme.  Select a card to play, in front of you, from those in-hand and pass the rest to the player on your left (while you receive a hand from the player on your right).  Try to collect sets of maki with the most roll count, or play wasabi on a nigiri to increase its value.  Collect dumplings, or sets of tempura.  Cute art, easy to play.

Unlike 7 Wonders, this is a light-hearted affair with cute drawings and an easy-to-comprehend scoring mechanic. 

Overall, Sushi Go is popular for a reason. Between the excellent artwork, simple rules, and genuine fun of set-collecting, it's a game that scratches a lot of itches for a lot of various gamer levels.

A stripped down version of 7 wonders. Gets straight to the heart of the matter without having the table administration. This is a great game to learn from. The skill graph is an interesting one. Once you actually have played this game many times, the skilled approach wil be obvious past the first one or two turns. Remember, when playing a two player game, you will have seen _all_ the cards by the second turn.

The sushi's are totally Kawaii btw.

Picked up for $11 at Barnes and Noble.  My 10-year-old and I played about 6 games (of 3 rounds each), one right after another.  It is super easy to learn, fun to play, and addictive.  My 7-year-old came into the room towards the end of our session and was anxious to learn as well.  But it was close to bedtime so we will have to wait until tonight to teach her.  I think it will be even more fun with the 3 of us.  Also, after sleeving the cards, I removed the black plastic card holder from the original tin box and the sleeved cards fit fine in the original box (just without the black plastic holder).

This game is great! Not because it is tough and/or deep, but because it is so simple and addictive.  It is a GREAT gateway game to a very common mechanic (drafting). I love watching people have that hopeful look as they receive their next hand of cards and either despair or glee depending if the card they were hoping or praying for to come back around is still there or not! It is portable and can be played anywhere: suggestion- sushi restaurant while waiting on your sushi boat!:)

If you're familiar with Fairy Tale, this is really just a streamlined version of that game - draft cards and collect cards in particular combinations to score the most points each round. It does have a few differences however, such as having certain cards that carry every from round to round, and that the whole deck is used just once.

A quick, fun diversion - but given the choice I'll just reach for FT instead. (Also I don't really care for sushi.)

RATING: 8
Incredibly simple drafting game. Just enough to it to be interesting, but simple enough for very young players.

Compared to 7 Wonders: the core interest in both games is the draft. While the additional complexities in 7W (resources/tech-tree, money, warfare, wonders) do make it a more interesting game, I'm not sure they make it more-interesting enough to be worth the additional playtime.

Compared to Fairy Tale: I like the lack of "score points if you get this other one specific card".

Certainly worth playing as a filler or as an introduction to drafting and variable scoring/set collection.

RATING: 9
SUSHI GO!

SUMMARY:
A very simple and very cute drafting game that will leave you wanting more an hour later.

PROS:
• Sushi Go! is a wonderfully designed game. The art for the various sushi is simply adorable (in the English version at least... the German art is rather unfortunate, especially for the unnecessarily grotesque melting "Pudding" card). Every time the tin has come off the shelf, someone has commented on how cute the art is, and given the Japanese theme, it fits really well. In addition to the art, the design of the cards themselves is refreshingly minimalistic, giving the player only the minimum information needed to convey the rules of each card.
• The gameplay is simple enough to learn, and the idea of card-drafting is presented as "sushi passing on a conveyor belt", which fits the theme in a fun way. It also makes the rules easier to explain, as anyone who doesn't play a lot of tabletop games is probably not very familiar with the idea of "drafting".
• The rules are straightforward, and there are many hair-pulling decisions that you will be forced to make along the way (should I take the Tempura I have now to make a pair, or a Maki so that I can possibly get the highest number at the end of the round??) The player will also have to decide whether to play offensively and score points for themselves, or play defensively and take cards to hurt their opponents.
• The fact that the Pudding cards are scored only at the end of all rounds also adds a layer of strategy to the game. Players will have to decide if they'd rather score some points in this round by pulling a trick, or take some Pudding to save for the end-game. 
• There is no "luck" component beyond what cards get drawn, initially. The players have full control over what happens within the round, so everyone can feel defeated/triumphant as a direct result of their own actions.

CONS:
• The game suffers in two-player, but a variant is offered where each player takes control of a third "Dummy" player, so the game is essentially played with three players (the Dummy gets a surprising amount of points). I highly suggest this variant when playing with two people. 
• On the bad side, the rule book could be improved. It is well-written, but not explained in an intuitive and progressive fashion, so the game mechanics do not make a lot of sense until you have read the whole thing cover-to-cover, short as it may be. This is a minor quibble, but I am a stickler for a well-written manual.
• Because of the fact that each round uses only a fraction of the entire deck, it is entirely possible to have "useless" cards circulating the table (ie. only a single Tempura, worth 0 pts without its matching pair). This can be somewhat frustrating in the beginning of the game, because players need to decide whether they want to take one of these cards, while gambling that their friends have the matching cards for them to use.
• Finally, the game comes in a metal travel tin with a blister tray to hold the cards in two halves. It's a very nice tin, and it is the perfect size to hold all the cards. However, for a card game with no extra components, a simple rigid box would have sufficed, and would lower the manufacturing costs (and therefore retail price) quite a bit. The price is already low enough, but I cannot see a practical reason why this was necessary.

CONCLUSION:
• Despite my few negative comments, Sushi Go! is a beautiful and fun game for 2-5 players, with cute artwork and a solid theme throughout.
• This is a great game for friends and family, to play for approximately 15-30 min before moving on to another game. The mechanics are very tight and condensed, and are simple to pick up on. I highly, highly recommend it.

★★★★★★★★★☆ 9/10

ADDITIONAL NOTE: If you have it in your budget, there is a more expensive (and larger) reimplementation of Sushi Go! called Sushi Go Party!, which adds additional card types, rules, and accommodates more players. From what I have read/seen, I believe that this is the "definitive" version of the game. However, I picked up the smaller tin for my girlfriend while traveling (no way I was going to lug around Party's enormous metal tin while flying) and we have not had any misgivings so far.

Admittedly, I did not like the game when I first played it. Thought it was just way too light. Nowadays I have a much better appreciation for this game, and what it is trying to accomplish. It is a useful gateway game for people who are not quite ready for gateway games. Yet it is not completely too brainless for seasoned gamers. After they get used to Sushi Go, then I'll recommend other drafting games like Medieval Academy, Zany Penguins, and 7 Wonders.

Very fast cute drafting game.  This is like a quick, more interactive version of 7 Wonders.  It's more interactive as it's more possible to pay attention to what other players are doing and make an effort to deny them things.  Very light and somewhat luck based, but still worth breaking out.

Excellent drafting mechanic and good introductory card game ... and that's it. 

The theme is quite childish and doesn't appeal to me while the strategy is lackluster at best. Waste of $10. 

I might be revisiting the series when "Sushi Go Party" is released but I am glad I was able to return my copy while I had the change. This shouldn't be a staple in anyone's collection.

It would be hard to find any reason to call this game objectionable.  It's ok, and it plays quickly enough to be painless.  But does it really need to exist?  Did I experience any fun, any angst, anything while playing it?  Not really.  And not really.

Card drafting simplicity at its finest. You are all making sushi orders at a restaurant while the conveyor belt (the cards) get passed from hand to hand. Whoever has the most of certain types of sushi (points) at the end wins.

I've heard tons of great things about this one so perhaps my expectations were too high, but it was only mediocre for me.  I've also played many of the predecessors so it did not have the unique innovative feel for me that it invoked in others.  I need to play it with my kids to see it through fresh eyes.  That's when the rating will probably go up for me.

RATING: 8
Players are diners at a Japanese "sushi train" restaurant, grabbing dishes as they pass by on the conveyor belt.  The game is played over three rounds, in solid 7 Wonders fashion - grab a card from the ever diminishing hand of cards, pass it on to the left, and pick up the passed cards to your right.  Standard scoring combos are present here that reminded me a lot of Knizia's "It's Mine".  Score the round, and repeat twice more.

All works well - plays in 10 minutes, cards are cute.  It won't be replacing Spacebeans as the "pass cards in a circle filler of choice", but it's a keeper anyway :)

Clever game that is easy to teach and play. Pick a card from a hand, pass the hand. Repeat until all cards are gone and then tally scores for sets and combinations. Suffers a bit from a dependence of the strength of the player to your right in how much you are blocked. Plays well with players of equal skill and experience, but veterans can easily take advantage of closely-situated rookies. Still, fun to play in short sessions, but can get old quickly.

This is pretty fun with more players. Very simply and straightforward game, added with the drafting (ala 7 Wonders) mechanic.

The fact that this was designed by the same guy who did Archaeology: The Card Game (Phil Walker-Harding) simply made me like it even more. Archaeology TCG is probably my most played filler of all time.

Sushi Go! is quick, fun, simple and very entertaining. However, like many other games, you'll probably outstay it's welcome if you play it repeatedly. If you mixed in with playing with new players, you should be okay.

What a fun little card-drafting game!  This game is super light weight and easy to learn, yet it still offers enough depth and decision making to keep players engaged.  Players must decide which cards to keep and try to score with, while considering what cards other players are playing and what cards are available in the hands getting passed around.  The game is reminiscent of 7 Wonders in the way it is played.  While it is lighter than 7 Wonders, it is beautiful in its simplicity and ease to play.  This is currently my favorite filler game.  Highly recommended!

Super simple drafting set collection, akin to 7 wonders. Plays so quickly it doesn't outstay its welcome. Originally expanded with a very small Soy Sauce promo, this game has now been replaced by its standalone expansion which adds variability from game to game. This game can be a bit difficult to teach as players need to be aware of every card's intended usage, but the new edition resolves that by having reminders on the table for every card in play. Retiring this for Sushi Go Party!

15-30m, best with 3-5 players. 20+ plays.

[b]previous comment:[/b]

Sushi go is a decent light drafting game, OK as a filler, but lacks the really interesting decisions that would keep me coming back to a game like this.  I typically suggest it occasionally as a way to gauge whether newer players are going to be interested in other drafting games, or as a way to pass time while waiting for another player to join, but it's not something I am dying to get to the table.

A cuter, simpler, and easier to pick up version of 7 Wonders, utilizing the same overall mechanic of simultaneous plays to build your "board" using a dwindling hand of cards that are passed around from player to player every turn.

Much quicker to pick up than 7 Wonders because scoring is far less complex, and fewer rules and cases need to be kept track of, for better or worse. Casual gamers will probably appreciate this more.

Played 4 times with 2&3 players. Like so many others have said, this is 7 Wonders ultra-lite, with a very colorful, very kawaii sushi theme. Perfect for sushi fans, cute-art fans, casual gamers, and families. Very easy to explain (the cards explain the scoring right on the face, and usually doa good job of representing the scoring in the picture on the card as well), short play time.

Please note that my high rating for the 2-player game is based on a variants identical to the one used for 7 Wonders: deal a third stack of cards and the players alternate drawing an extra card from that third pile and playing a card for both the player and the "dummy" player. This makes for a much better game.

Just taught this to a 5-year old and a 7-year old using a 5-card deal followed by a 4-card deal to constitute a round (making holding cards and making decisions more manageable).

Update: Meh. Too Simple.

Played 6 times for 2.5 hours.

Pros
-Excellent (pure/distilled) use of drafting mechanic
-Simple rules, easy to teach
-Casual friendly theme, cute artwork, good for all ages
-Short play time, variable player count
-Gives every player several choices each turn, little luck to screw players over

Cons
-Hard to balance screwing other players over and benefiting yourself (usually the latter takes priority in 3+ player games)
-Game play can get repetitive

17.oct.2015 - Lo subo de 7.75 a 9 al establecer la categoría "filler" para evaluar estos pequeños juegos en su justa medida.

El filler más adictivo al que he jugado nunca. Es súper sencillo y tontorrón, pero mola un montón y cuando acaba estás deseando de que alguien diga "otra!"

Mein Erklärbar Kai meinte in der Erstpartie vor der Erklärbärung: "SUSHI GO ist ideal für Leute, denen man Drafting näher bringen möchte." Das trifft tatsächlich den Nagel auf den Kopf. In diesem Sinne ist SUSHI GO ein Lernspiel, erster Tag Volkshochschule Thema "Drafting am Spieleabend." Im weiteren Sinne ist es sehr nett. Aus einem Handkartenset Karte auswählen und vor sich ausspielen, Rest weitergeben, vom rechten Nachbarn dessen Handkarten bekommen. Wieder eine auswählen und ausspielen, Rest wieder weitergeben. Im günstigsten Fall ergeben sich Sushi-Gerichte, die in Set Collection Kombis Punkte bringen. Die Karten sind in ruhigem Bunt schön und comiclike gestaltet. Eine der besseren Muscheln im seichten Gewässer der Absacker vor der japanischen Küste. SUSHI GO can stay.

Very light card-drafting set collection game. Plays extremely quickly (15 minutes to play the three scoring rounds). A low barrier to entry in price and complexity while still rewarding strategic players. Only negative is the theme - I never eat sushi so had no idea what the dishes on the cards actually taste like.

Basic card drafting game and set collection game.  Most editions have cute art (although apparently there's one that does NOT... German I think....).  Good choice for newer gamers.  If you like it, Fairy Tale is a bit of a step up in complexity.

RATING: 6
The scoring is reasonably smart, but too much of the game comes in being lucky with first draws or practically scripted priorities. Those priorities are thankfully thrown off by the Pudding that scores at the end and is of variable value dependent upon the scenario.
Functional with 2, sweet spot at 3 since players get to see their starting hand thrice and get the last card from it and competition for Pudding is a lot less ridiculous.
The game does play very quickly and lightly though if looking for a nice filler.

An enjoyable, light drafting game for kids:  simple & straightforward card combinations make the usual drafting considerations a little less thinkey than other games in the genre (e.g. Fairy Tale). It usually amounts to "do I take this card for points or give it up and take a card that someone else will use for more points?"  Plays quickly and easy to teach.  Also great for getting kids to practice their arithmetic ;)

Surprisingly fun game for such simple mechanics. Easy enough to teach to my children (8 & 6 at this time) but still with a bit of strategy when it comes to drafting that it makes you think.

While the game doesn't blow me away, it's still fun for what it is and a great game to play with kids.

The cute artwork is the initial draw.  Many of my students wanted to play it based on the sushi art.

Cute, goes by quickly. Two player games not as interesting as with more players. Pretty average for me--the plus is the cute artwork, but for gameplay I'd rather play something else.

Update: Tried it with four players and... we were kind of bored by it. There's a strategy here, but it's not particularly involved, and the time spent feels like it could be better used on other things.

I'm not sure why, but the card drafting mechanism really turned me off. It could be more interesting in longer/heavier games, but here, it just made me not want to play the game.

Sushi Go! is a cute, easy to learn game for new gamers to pick up on quickly and for seasoned gamers to enjoy in its simplicity. Don't take that to mean that the game is "dumbed down" however - in fact, it can easily become a strategic memory and math game once you've gotten a few rounds under your belt.

I've rated this game a 10 because, honestly, it deserves it, but the new Sushi Go! Party is out now and there's no reason not to buy that version instead.

Components: ok components, lovely box
Complex: really easy
Weight: family
Players: 4
Length: less than 30 mins
Mechanics: set collection
Decisions: enough for this kind of game (what card to play, which cards to pass)
Opinion: fast family game that would be played several times in a row. Each play is around 15-20 mins, and probably you would like a second one.
The game is as easy as take one card from your hand, play it and pass the rest. Repeat with the cards you have received.
Once the round end you score the different receipts you have made, keeping the desserts to the end of the game. So you have to decide if you go for cards scoring directly, cards that need more than one to score, cards than score depending on majority or cards to score at the end of the game.
Not a game I would be playing all days, but I would not say no to a game

I am not bowled over by the illustrations on the cards I am okay with cute Japanese art but (for me) a different illustrator might have done a better job using the same style.

This replaced a deck of cards for my family. It took them a couple of rounds to get the gist of it but has been a big hit every since. Very easy to teach and looks very appealing to non-gamers. What's not to love about cute looking sushi?!

That said this has flopped when I played it with my gaming friends. Not enough strategy, too light and the theme didn't really appeal to them either. 

Has been replaced by Sushi Go Party but I'm not convinced that's a big improvement, if it's an improvement at all.

A good pace keeps the game quick and interesting, while having just enough depth to warrant a few plays. Awesome for introducing the concept of drafting. Loving this one lately because of how fast and simple it is, while still providing a solid, albeit basic drafting environment.

Game lacks depth to some extent in that it is relatively solitary. Trying to pick up on signals/hate draft and how fast it is keeps it interesting.

A very fun and very unique fast card game. You constantly have to pass the cards back and forth between players, choosing 1 card to keep for yourself each time. If it was a longer game, it could easily get annoying, but it's about the perfect length and it makes for some fantastic guesswork/psychoanalysis about which cards you think the other players will go for and which ones you think might still be there for you to grab in the future.

First off, I will say, this is not necessarily a bad game. I personally hate it, but let me qualify that with the fact that I am also terrible at it. I have never won. This contributes to my distaste for the game considerably, and may also be a factor in why my friends love playing it with me. This is an attractive set collection game that is easy to learn but provides some real challenge. There are really no specific mechanics I can fault, nor design feature I can claim as detractors other than the simultaneous action (which for me personally sucks, as I get flustered). I would say, if you like Egyptian rat-screw or Uno, and sushi, this will really up your game. It just makes me hungry and grumpy.

I love drafting games; ever since my first time drafting Magic: The Gathering it's been a game mechanism that always provides a fun challenge for me. I like how much playing Sushi Go or any drafting game at differing player counts impacts the way it plays.

Japo vacsi csata.
A játékosok (2-5 személy) japán étteremben töltik estéjüket az étlapról (kártyákból) válogatva. Az elfogyasztott ételek megfelelő kombinációjával a játék során pontokat szerzel. A játék 3. fordulójának végén – minő meglepetés – a legtöbb pontot megszerző gurmé nyer.
Egy fordulóban a játékosok számától függően mindenki 7-10 lapot kap a kezébe. Mindenki kiválaszt egyet, majd képpel lefelé maga elé helyezi. Mikor mindenki választott, megfordítjuk a lapokat és továbbadjuk balra a megmaradt kártyákat; és ez így megy, ameddig minden lap a kezekből le nem kerül a játékosok elé. Ekkor megállapítjuk ki mennyi pontot szerzett ebben a fordulóban, majd az előttünk lévő lapokat egy közös dobópakliba tesszük és új kártyák kiosztásával megkezdjük a következő fordulót.
A lapok közül valamelyik magában már pontot ér (ezt extrán ízesíteni is lehet plusz pontért), valamelyikből 2 vagy 3 db kell egy meghatározott pontértékhez, valamelyikből minél többet fogyasztasz, annál több pontot hoz a konyhára. Egyes esetekben az adott ételből legtöbbet maga elé helyező játékos kap pontot és van, amit csak az utolsó fordulóban értékelünk ki (igen, azt nem helyezzük a fordulók között a dobópakliba).
A nagy kérdések játék közben hogy mit kapok a következő fordulóban, mit ne adjak tovább a másiknak és melyik lenne nekem a legértékesebb ételkombó. Mindez szerencsével fűszerezve.
Gyorsan tanulható és játszható kártyagém, amely nem fekszi meg a gyomrodat. Csodálkozom, hogy nem jelent meg még a magyarított változata.

The owner of this copy that I played described this as "7 Wonders-lite".  I'd agree with that sentiment, and as such, I guess I didn't think this was a particularly great game.  7 Wonders still has a lot of luck, however, you can mitigate it by seeing who is building next to you.  There is more permanence, so you can actually devise a strategy and try to manage the draft luck to mitigate losses or stretch for buildings.

Here, there is enough meat that you can analyze what other players are doing to some extent.  It is much easier than 7 Wonders to give someone useless crap, or very low value things.  It plays quickly, which is nice, but there are games like Loot, Roll Through the Ages, Hanabi, Risk & Roll, Lost Cities, etc., that play in this 20-30 minute window and provide much better experiences.

(03/04/2015) Comment based on one play.

This is a ridiculously trivial and simple card game, with a pasted on sushi-theme on top of a supremely dumbed-down version of 7 Wonders card drafting mechanism. 

Stupid fun? Fun, but stupid? I dunno. It takes slightly less brain cells than Machi Koro, but I'm just glad it only lasts about 10 minutes. It's a "6".

It's fun and fast game to play. Very dinamic.
You change your strategies constantly.
Enjoyable for all ages, I would recommend that and adult or a "big brother" help to keep the scores if the players are children.
There are some scorecards on the files section and a few apps that might help you to keep an eye on the scores.

--------------------

Divertido, rápido y dinámico.
El juego constantemente te fuerza a cambiar de estrategia.
Recomendado para todas las edades, para el caso de niños pudiera ser recomendable que jugaran con un adulto o un hermano mayor quien les ayude con las reglas y puntuación durante el juego.
También es posible encontrar tablas de marcadores en los archivos de esta página y algunas apps que pueden ayudar a dar seguimiento a la puntuación.

Good filler-game with great art and theme. It's different enough from other common lightweight card games to make it worth playing and has enough familiar concepts (collect sets of X, pairs of Y, etc) that lightweight gamers will play. One of the ONLY games I have gotten my non-gaming dad to play.

What a great little filler! It's like they took the fun part of 7 Wonders and added some neat set-collection concepts and voila!  It's a very quick drafting game with adorable sushi artwork.  I played it with three, which I think is a good number, because I was able to plan on getting back some of the cards I passed. Still good with more, though.

This totally replaces 7 Wonders as far as I'm concerned.

7/19/15 update: bumping this up. Over time, Sushi Go! has really cemented itself in my collection. I'm actually going to say that I like this more than 7 Wonders. It gives me 90% of the satisfaction with 5% of the teaching difficulty (people seriously get overwhelmed with all of the 7W iconography) and none of the scoring annoyance - yeah, yeah, I know there are apps, but that's a solution to a problem that never should have existed in the first place. 7W may have more depth, but I've learned, over time, that I don't actually care all that much about depth in my drafting game. I'll take 15 minutes of crazy kawaii any day.

Cool little game. Adorable artwork, easy to learn, quick to play, lots of fun. Good gateway to 7 Wonders if you have civilians in the group.

RATING: 6
Un filler de 15 minutos que suele durar 30 porque alguien siempre pide una revancha.

Es un juego al estilo de 7 wonders, dónde se toma una carta de un grupo y se pasa el resto al jugador de la izquierda. El objetivo es reunir la mejor combinación de cartas que te permita puntuar más que tus contrincantes, sabiendo que cada carta puntúa de maneras distintas (unas puntúan sólo si van en parejas, otras en tríos, otras por si mismas, otras sólo si eres el que más tiene de ellas...) Además, hay dos de ellas que tienen habilidades especiales, como el wasabi, que multilica el valor de determinadas cartas que se juegan sobre él o los palillos, que te permitirán jugar dos cartas seguidas.

PROS: Filler ideal para niños o para novatos que quieren una puerta de entrada en el mundillo. Grafismo muy atractivo. Reglas supersencillas que vienen impresas en las cartas para que todo el mundo pueda aprenderlas y recordarlas.

CONS: Apuntar los PV´s en un papel es algo que ningún juego moderno debería hacer, pero es un mal menor. Quizá es demasiado simple para el jugón medio. Poca profundidad estratégica. Funciona mal a 2 jugadores

The absolute simplest drafting game I've played so far. It might get boring if you played nothing but this for a while, but it's short, sweet and doesn't outstay its welcome.

July14:

With two players, I'd only ever play the advanced variant.  It does use a dummy player, but in a very smooth way (much smoother than 7 Wonders for example).

Overall, it is a simpler game than other card drafters, but it makes up for it in cuteness some (sounds odd coming from me).  Would also be more palatable for families.  If you're a fan of card drafting games, I'd snag it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
An extremely pretty and colorful card-picking game that has become a staple in our group as a palate-cleanser of sorts (after or between more involved games), as well as a good pick-up game. Scoring is simple, hands move quickly, and people can pick up the rules in a single round, yet there's some room for strategy and trolling. It's not the deepest or most complex game, but it might be the one I've played the most games of.

It's a cute little drafting game.  There's not much to the game play, but hey, it's a filler.  The basic mechanism is that you deal and score three independent rounds, with each card type having different scoring rules.  There are two exceptions to the basic mechanism.  Pudding stays out between between rounds and scores at the end of the game.  Chopsticks don't score anything but allow you, on a future turn in the round, to draft two cards instead of one.  When you do that, you put the chopsticks in the hand to keep the hand sizes equal.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (August 2014)

Sushi go is a borderline 6.0 for me. I think with more plays its rating will go down as 7 wonders did. Still I enjoyed my play of this. It is a very simple game with some interesting decisions. The art is good and it play very fast. 

I think it is best play with 3 players, with 5 the game has a lot more luck and a lot less control. Also I think it doesn’t have much replayability (the reason I think I will downgrade its rating), but perhaps I will buy for the family.

I dislike the chopstick cards as they are (for the most part) an auto play and they break the rules of the game allowing for much more uncontrollable luck. 

In conclusion, Sushi Go is a VERY simple drafting game, its main strength is its fast playtime.

Everybody's game.

Fast, cute, strategy and tactics. Awareness of other player's strategies keeps this one fresh and highly skilled as sabotage becomes important and lifts it into longevity.  If you play this beyond your first impressions you may find the depth and fun within. One of my most highly recommended new games.

I just learned and played this with 3 other participants in a library board game night. The setup and structure of the game took a only a few minutes (including reading the rule book out loud and dealing the first round of the cards). We all enjoyed this game, and played through a couple times taking only 20 minutes total. This is great, since it is only a 2-hour program. We are all excited to play it again in our next board game night!

Another light filler game, but a fave among my family. Great for families and kids. Cute theme and a light mechanic that allows for a decent amount of strategy, despite the random luck element of card draws. Each player starts with a and of cards, keeps one and passes the rest. Not only do you need to draw the cards you need for your own scoring purposes, but you need to watch what other people are collecting (especially the person you are passing to) and sometimes you will keep a card defensively.

Inoffensive game, I suppose. One of this game's alleged selling points is that it distills [i]7 Wonders[/i] into a quicker and easier game, but that's why I don't think too much of [i]Sushi Go[/i]. The distillation process seems to have sucked out the fun and interest. I prefer the bulk that [i]7 Wonders[/i] provides.

I dislike the art; I will play again if asked; and I won't seek to acquire the game.

Sushi Go is a fantastic game, and to me, is one of the best introductions to deckbuilding/drafting type games. To top it off, the graphics are stunningly cute, which really adds to the appeal of the game, and gets a lot of people to the table who otherwise might be hesitant to learn a new game. 

My one regret is having learned 7 Wonders first, as the games are mechanically fairly similar, and 7 Wonders is more complex - I feel like if I had learned Sushi Go first, I both would have learned 7 Wonders more quickly, and would get bored of Sushi Go less often. 

Which brings me to the one downside - Sushi Go is a great starter game, and I will almost never turn it down, but I admit that it can get a little boring and repetitive over time, and it's not the sort of game you can cultivate much of a strategy beyond the obvious. For this reason, I think it's an extremely good game for a more beginner/casual type player, but it loses its lustre fairly quickly for more serious gamers. Even so, for those times where you're looking for something light and fluffy (but not stupid), Sushi Go is still a very good choice and still remains squarely in the rotation.

A Sushi Go Partyval előbb játszottam, mint ezzel, így tudtam, hogy mire számíthatok. Szerintem szuper, hogy itt gyakorlatilag nincs előkészületi idő. A Party-ban azért  mire összeválogatja az ember, hogy mit akar használni, mire elmondja mindegyiknek a szabályát, 10-20 perc is eltelhet, itt az 5. percben már kezdődhet a játék minden szabálymagyarázattal együtt. :) Számíthat. Szerintem remek, fillernek, gyors játéknak sokkal inkább ezt ajánlanám, mint a Party-t, mert annyival nem több, mint amennyivel drágább és macerásabb.

I like drafting as a game mechanism that serves a purpose. I don’t like drafting for draftings sake. This is one of the most uninteresting and uninspiring fillers I’ve played, although the art is cute. If your looking for a game to introduce beginners, there are much better options out there.

Very solid filler game.

Can get a bit samey, but I think it is less susceptible to that then most fillers.  Each round can be totally different, and part of the meta ends up being, how likely is it that this round doesn't have two other sashimi?  Etc.  I like that.

On most turns I feel like I have choices between different things that really do have merit.  At the same time, people don't take too long on their decisions.  That is really hard to find in a game.

Super cute art too.

Very fun light filler that the kids get a lot of enjoyment from.  I'm not sure I would have gotten this to play with a group of adults, but it is a great little game.  Takes the card drafting mechanic and creates an entire game around it that is easy to grasp for younger players while leaving adults satisfied at the same time.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
An enjoyable and attractive drafting game that feels substantially different at small vs large player counts. Much like 7 Wonders, it's a fixed number of cards per round regardless of player count, but unlike 7 Wonders, you're looking less at the long-term and more at immediate combos -- so in a 2- or 3-player game, you could reasonably spend the first couple of rounds looking at the multiple-card scoring options before committing to them, whereas a high-player-count game is going to rely more on guesswork.

If you have kids and don't have this yet. Stop reading and go and buy it. 

Sorry I meant, stop reading, go and buy Incan Gold and then get this.

This is a great set collection card drafting game. It has a simple rule set, very clear and wonderfully clean card art and plays quickly and is great fun. Never heard a bad word against it except for " it isn't as good as Incan Gold is it!". For me it isn't as good as Incan gold but that doesn't have to be a derogatory remark. This is a really fun game that we have enjoyed a lot. It is also one of the first games the kids request when ever we plan travel gaming ... stick that in your blowpipe and smoke it Incan Gold ... with all your jewelly bits you're no good for travel!

Also looking forward to Sushi Go Party coming out later this year. Seems to do for Sushi Go what G54 did to Coup. If your kids understand that there definitely going to want a copy

A fun and simple drafting game.  And a great way to teach the concept to anyone new to the gaming world.  With 7 Wonders considered one of the pinnacles of this genre of gaming and being a popular game for many new people, this game does and excellent job allowing someone to understand the mechanics before playing something a little heavier.

I also think my wife would really enjoy this game.  It's small enough to take to dinner and short enough to finish on the go.

This one will stay in my collection for a long time.

And the artwork is awesome!

A highly enjoyable drafting game and a great gateway for drafting games for non-gamers.  Artwork alone is enough to grab attention.

However, the game doesn't have a lot of depth to it and it doesn't work well with two players.

Quick and fun replacement for 7 wonders with people who are not into games (ahem *my parents*) or kids. Still, can be very fun with two adults. Here is how we play for 2 people.

Each of the 3 rounds: give each players 10 cards

Each turn:
 - Draw a card (except on first turn)
 - Play a card face down
 - Discard a card
 - Reveal played card
 - Exchange hands

On the final round, end when there is no more card to draw.

This is a great game to play with the family! It's portable enough to bring with us to dinner and easy enough to play and put away. My 6 year old has no problem with the strategy aspect, and the kids can help add up the scores. So it's good for math learning as well. 

The rules are a bit daunting, and could be better written, so it's best to just play a round. Once one person "gets it" they can explain it to the rest. New players can learn how the game goes by playing a single round, so it's quick to pick up.

Super light, super cute (love the pudding and gyoza). It's been a hit with anyone I've taught. 

As the player count increases the amount of control you have over the drafting hands decreases, but I think the game plays so quickly I don't mind as much as I do in, say, 7 Wonders.

Sushi Go! is a very light card drafting game in which players are trying to collect the best combination of cards to generate points.  The player with the most points at the end of three rounds wins.

Everyone starts with a number of cards dependant upon how many players are participating.  From your starting hand you will choose one card.  Then everyone simultaneously reveals the card they chose and puts it in their tableau.  You then hand the remainder of your cards to the player on your left, and take a new set of cards from the player on your right.  This routine of choosing and passing cards continues until there are none remaining.  The cards you've collected over the round are scored.  This process is repeated twice more, and a final tally is taken.

Sushi Go! uses the same drafting mechanic found in games like Citadels, Fairy Tale, and Among the Stars.  However, it is much easier to get into than any of those games.  The iconography is straight forward and cutesy.  The way in which cards combo off of each other for points is spelled out clearly on the bottom of each card.

I recommend Sushi Go! to anyone who likes card drafting games.  Yes, it's light, but it makes for a fast, fun experience.  It's great as a filler, or to wind the night down with.  If you haven't tried a card drafting game before, then this is a great first one to purchase.  It's easy to understand, and will allow you to get your head around the basic strategies involved in such games, priming you for more intricate drafting games in the future.

RATING: 9
Best drafting game. I like it more than 7 Wonders, which it has probably been insipred by. Rules are very simple and printed on cards too so anyone can learn it in a minute. Artwork is very cute and the box looks welcoming. Scoring on paper is a small minus - that shouldn't be done in modern games, include score tokens or something! But other than that it's a very nice package. Takes 10-15 minutes to play.

2-Player Comment:
*It uses dummy mechanic that really messes with elegance of the game. I wouldn't recommend it. If you start complicating things with a dummy player then you might aswell play 7 Wonders 2p at that point for your drafting fix, since elegance is the biggest attraction of Sushi Go.

Very quick game with light tactical decisions.  Game plays in 3 rounds.  The 3rd round has extra scoring on pudding cards kept through all 3 rounds, which adds some long-term planning as well as additional decisions to make in the 3rd round.  Never gets heavy but not brainless either.  Some memory, some tactics, some blocking other players from completing sets--it's a nice light brain workout.

My kids love this game.  The rules are super simple and the artwork is cute.  It makes for a fun game for adults too when brainpower is at a premium.

Snappy little drafting/set collection game that is like a stripped down version of [i]7 Wonders[/i].  Falls into the same category for me as games such as [i]No Thanks[/i] and [i]Coloretto[/i] (i.e. - a game that both my wife and young daughter will play with me).  The various ways of scoring VP kind of remind me of [i]Ra[/i], strangely enough.  Even gamers that typically play medium weight games will enjoy this one as a filler.

**********

This game is like crack with non-gamers.  In fact, it has gone over well with all sorts of crowds -- a 5 year old, a couple of 14 year olds (they liked it the most), the wife, and gamers.

With the right publisher and marketing, there is no reason that [i]Sushi Go[/i] couldn't be sold next to [i]Monopoly Millionaire[/i] and [i]Uno[/i] in every Target.

A very light card drafting game. I know some people say there's no point to playing this, but it's much less involved than 7 Wonders or Among the Stars. I think it's perfect for a gateway drafting game (or for playing with young children).

I found this game pretty dull and simple. The theme was too abstract for me to be engaged in anything but the mechanics, which were too simple to get much out of.

Brilliant little card game which fits perfectly alongside the likes of Coloretto and No Thanks.  Excellent art with a fun theme, simple but meaningful decisions, easy to teach, and quick to play.  This is a great game to have on hand with any group, especially casual gamers who love card games and want to try something a little different.  The card drafting provides good interaction, not so much verbally, but in paying very close attention to what other players are doing.  There is also zero individual down time, which is great.  Finally, if you want to get casual gamers into a deeper drafting game, such as 7 Wonders, this is an excellent way to get them fluent with the drafting mechanism making other games much easier to teach.  I would love to see future mini expansions which add a new sushi type and also bump the player count up to 6 or 7.

Casual gaming set collection 7 wonders with sushi conveyor restaurant theme. Lots of thinking ahead. Don't end your round with chopsticks.

I watched a play through before purchasing and it had some awesome score keeping cards and this version didn't have any. I ended up making my own with my own creative touch and also made some arrow cards to limit confusion of the different directional passing of cards between rounds.

This is a fantastic entry-level card drafting game.  The art is really cute, the theme (while almost completely pasted on) is fun, and it's very light and quick playing.

It's really lighter than I'd like, but I imagine it will see a lot of play given that I'm so often playing with non gamers.  I rate it a solid 7 and it may to go 8 after more plays with more players.

The 2 player variant is surprisingly solid and probably ups the strategy by a noticeable amount...not that there's much though.  I could see this being best with 3 or 4, which is what the current poll suggests, but I won't rate it myself without more plays.

My only problem is that I'm inclined to sleeve a game like this, but the game insert isn't conducive.  I'll either sleeve it and throw out the nice custom insert, or just let the cards get thrashed, knowing another copy will be very cheap.

[microbadge=13314] = first three plays only

03-Jul-2015:  This is a fun card-drafting game where you must collect sets of cards to score points.  It's a kind of a 7 Wonder Lite, if you will.  The game plays out in three rounds.  Choose one card to play on your turn, then pass the rest of your hand to the next player.  Repeat until the cards run out.  Do this three times.  Most points win.

The charm of the game is in the ease of play, the short playtime, and cute artwork.  It's a nice little game for family game night and/or casual gamers.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A much lighter and easier 7 Wonders. The only downside is the need to keep score without tokens or markers, which feel really out of place in modern games. Then again, I'm glad it's just cards and not a ton of tiny bits.

This is a very quick to learn and play game that I get out and play with both gamers and non-gamers alike. I'm a sucker for cute art and this has it in spades.

I can't help but to like this game even though it must be about 90% luck and only 10% strategy. It goes really fast and by the time you reach the third round you'll be surprised at how fast it went. Then you'd normally want to play it again because of its short duration. This gets repeated so many times until the luck factor gets too apparent and you tire of it. But as soon as you take the game out, the same cycle starts again.

This is a great gateway game. You can explain it in minutes and it's fast and simple. The only thing I would advise if you are starting with new players is this game works a whole lot better when you go fast. If you get bogged down in someone staring at their cards trying to find the perfect play, that can seriously detract from the fun for new players. You first few games, just tell people they are over thinking it and just play. After everyone gets the hang of it, and they are hooked, then you can get a little more serious. Excellent game with kids!

I got this for my 6 year old daughter and she loves it!  She loves the art work, the theme and the game play.  Based on her reaction, I would rate Sushi-Go a 9 for 6-8 year-olds.  But as a gamer, it isn't great.  There just isn't enough complexity in the sets you are drafting: what this means is that the choices are obvious and at the end of the round there are often no useful cards to draft. I recommend a variant rule that you can keep 1 incomplete set at the end of a round (to be completed in the next round).

Mindenképpen játszanom kell még vele, mert egyelőre sajnos nem váltotta be a hozzá fűzött reményeket. Abban bíztam, hogy egy pörgős, addiktív játékra lelek, de sajnos én nem kattantam rá. Kicsit esetlegesnek érzem (mint ált. a draft játékokat), de mivel a Sushi go! rendkívül könnyed és gyors, ezért megállja a helyét a maga nemében. Kedvenc azért nem lett.

RATING: 8
This game has been a real slow grower on me. I initially bought it as a kind of family-style intro to 7 Wonders, but was underwhelmed by what seemed like too little complexity. It's biggest strength was how well it went over with non-gamers. After several plays now, I have seen a subtle strategy emerge that consists almost entirely of indirect denial of cards to other players. It's so simple that you  just only watch your neighbors, you have to monitor the whole table to win. I use the 7 wonders "changing directions between rounds" as I think it adds a cool twist. This one is a current favorite of the gf and friends, so I am sure will continue to get many plays.

Sushi Go! combines the card drafting mechanic seen in Fairy Tale and made more famous in 7 Wonders. It also combines a set of scoring options that are closer to Fairy tale than 7 Wonders. 

Essentially Sushi Go! is a set collection game that uses card drafting to drive the play and allow for interesting decisions. Namely...what do I need to keep and what do my opponents need?

The game uses a combination of long term objectives and short term objectives as all but puddings are discarded at the end of each of the 3 rounds, so each scoring goal for different card types must be completed within a single round or they are lost. 

I have had great success with Sushi-Go with non-gamers and I think gamers will also enjoy it if the group is looking for a quick (10-15 min) diversion as an opener or a closer to a session. 

For me this is a great game to train non-gamers to get comfortable with the drafting mechanic to bridge the game between their inexperience with games and the requirements of 7 Wonders. 

Another great title from Adventureland Games.

-Counting points I guess?

Excellent little game, especially when played with your smart friends. Believe me they'll enjoy it. It's got so simple rules that even the most non-gamy people will get it, just like with a game of regular cards.

I don't really see any negatives actually. However, I just can't give it a 10. I cannot explain to a non-gamer why it's good unlike my other 10's; I have to tell them "just trust me!" Luckily, the art helps with that.

I can't believe how much I adore this game! At first the rules seemed odd and difficult, but soon into my first game I began to see the risk reward and set collecting aspects, and I was instantly hooked.  The best feeling is when you always feel like your betting against the odds, and each time you successfully win just makes you feel a bit more confident.  Plus, when you loose a round or don't complete the needed sets, you feel like you were at fault for the failure.  You never get that "too random" feeling, your your fait was in your hand.  I played this at least six games on the first night I picked it up! It was perfect for our group of adults, and I'd imagine kids would like it too.

Giving it an extra .5 for being a really fun game for 2 players as well :)

Man, my wife is a shark at this game. She just scores consistently, never the biggest of the round, just consistently high enough to win each game.

________________________________

My six year old has started playing this game. She has a grasp of the chopsticks really well. That is usually the hardest part of the game to get people to understand. The rest of the strategies are taking some time, but she is really keen to play this so it may get more play in the near future. 12/4/16

With more plays, I'm finding more and more enjoyable. Great because it is easy to teach and anyone can play. The card drafting is simple and engaging. Took me a while to realise it can make a great 2 player game. The theme is spot on and you can laugh at Maki Roll eating competitions, or saving some pudding for later. If anything, would be good to have a more visiable way of keeping score, the abundance of scoring apps is good. For its price, everyone should have a copy in their collection.

Nice and simple drafting game. Really like the theme and the cute artwork, but there is not a lot on offer here for strategic game play. Not that its a bad game, rather it is targeted for a younger age group (I would recommend 8-15 years old). Alternatively it can be used as a gateway game to introduce drafting to older inexperienced players.

Decent filler game with drafting elements. I find I like some filler games a bit, but I really want deeper, yet still fun fillers, and this isn't quite deep enough for my tastes. I would put this filler at the level of maybe For Sale, No Thanks!, Coloretto, etc. The best one I know is Splendor, and my goal is to see a filler of that caliber. I think 7 Wonders can come close, but its not quite there, though 7 Wonders is definitely better (but its setup, need for 3-6 for good gameplay, and icons drops it in my book too).

Luck seems to disproportionately determine the winner -- did your initial hand contain a wasabi, did the hand to your right contain more than one nigiri, if so you win.

Quick game which is even more a distillation of the Magic drafting mechanic than 7 Wonders is. It's enjoyable as a filler, though strategy is limited.

I do wish that there was a little more inter-round interaction than just puddings; for me this provides opportunity to strategise a little, otherwise it becomes an exercise in picking the most obvious card.

It comes in a nice tin box, with cheap cardstock cards but great art and graphic design at an unbeatable price. 

It is a textbook draft + set collection filler that lasts only 15 minutes. I have penalized its lack of originality with my rating, because there is one hundred games like this one. 

Otherwise, it feels like a very light 7 Wonders. Almost no thinking is required, it's most about luck and how bad the previous player wants to punish you; that's for the bad, but also for the good, because games are very short.

It will never become my game of choice for those 15 minutes moments (I now prefer Port Royal by far), but I won't say no if offered to play. Just no repeats, please! 

It is but entertaining, but I wouldn't say "fun".

Quirky little card game where you compete in a draft system to gather cards and earn points.  Rather easy to set up and play, though you have to trust people to calculate their scores correctly.

We play a homebrew variant that we aptly call Sushi Now.  Round 1 draft gives 10 seconds to pick a card.  Round 2 draft gives 5 seconds.  And Round 3 draft only gives 3 seconds to pick a card.  Fast and fun mayhem ensues.

Despite the rating I do enjoy quite well. Thing is my group of friends and family solely would want to play this game only which becomes boring to me. There is some underlying strategy, my tips are unless it's potentially the final card for the player to get a massive lead eg wasabi or last sashimi, dont block a player and focus on urself, also dont focus on maki and pudding unless no one is going for them. I am very much considering selling the game and upgrading to the deluxe edition in the future

[i]After my initial excitement I ended up buying a copy. After a couple of plays our interest quickly faded and I ended up trading it. For my money Medieval Academy is the better drafting family/filler game (and even that game is on the bubble for me).[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]- Excellent gateway into card drafting games.
- The art is perfect for this game, great color palette.
- Quick filler that is perfect for beginning/ending a game night.
- Plays great with 3+ players.
- Excellent card quality except the backs of the soy sauce promo don't match my copy.[/i]

Simplified version of 7 Wonders. 
My daughter even said "that looks good" to the Maki roll. So now there is hope for someone else in my family to like sushi!

RATING: 6
There's nothing to dislike about this game, except for the fact that they took out the scoring trays from the original game. Many points lost for that one.

RATING: 6.5
Not really much meat in this. But perfect palette cleanser between meatier games or just a game to talk over while having a nice time.

Ultimately traded it away since there are better fillers in my opinion. Loved the artwork, but wasn't fond ofthe card backs and card stock quality.

For whatever reason, the sushi conveyor aspect of the card draft completely escaped me during our play.  It was thinking about the game afterward where I thought, "Oh! I get it!"  Fun quick little game.  A little easier to plan with a 2 player game over more players, so I think makes it a little more strategic.

The lightest of light fillers, it takes the Fairy Tale hand mechanic and crosses it with the scoring rules from It's Mine, or Ra. Pick a card, add it to your tableau, pass your hand to the left. Repeat ‘til all cards are gone. Score. Do two more hands. In the time you've taken to read this, the game is close to over. If the 5 minute game niche is one you need to add to in your collection, this will do the job. If you enjoy the search for combos in the pass-on genre though, you may want to stick with the longer games, as the combos come fast and easy here.

RATING: 6
"Quick passing-draft/tableau game, very comparable to Fairy Tale. SG is FAR easier to teach, with excellent graphic design. I don't like the majority scoring in SG, and I prefer the FT drafting rules."

What I like:
- Quick to teach, quick to play (15 minutes)
- No direct attacks
- The long-term pudding goal is great

What I don't like:
- Playing each card as you draft encourages hate-drafting
- Being forced to play your last card sucks
- The sushi theme is a negative for me

This is a clever game that was surprisingly good. If it were rethemed, it would probably replace Fairy Tale for me, despite my dislike of majority scoring. I would put the weight around 1.5.

Fun, quick, easy to learn, cute cards. Plays up to 5 because you're not supposed to replay cards that have been picked at all. But I like playing with 6-8 people so we just reshuffle in the cards we discarded anyway, although it throws off the games balance/probability. Still fun regardless. Playing with 2-5, download the Sushi Go! Score keeping app!

Sushi Go! is a 7 Wonders-style draft-and-pass card game.  The cards you draft give you points in a variety of ways--some are worth points by themselves, others are only worth points in sets with other similar cards, and still others depend on who has the most of that card at the end of the round.  Because you can see what everyone else has played, you know whether you are helping to set others up with your passing, and tactical counter-drafting is an option.  This game just feels like it has exactly the right combination of options for a light filler.

The best pure drafting game I've tried, no kidding! This avoids most of the other drafting games' flaws (I'm looking at you 7 Wonders).

2 players works well the original as well as with the 3rd dummy player alternative, works great with up to 5 players, and I wouldn't be surprised if 6-7 was not achievable!

Be careful if you are playing with people that struggle with making fast decisions as they will hold the game up for everyone :(

Imagine a complexity continuum of card-drafting games. 7 Wonders is on the far end, as most complex. Fairy Tale sits in the center, and Sushi Go is way over at the easy end. I taught this to total non-gamers and they picked up the idea pretty quickly and then wanted to play again. This game does exactly what it sets out to do, and I appreciate it for that. Given my druthers, I’d choose one of the other drafting games I mentioned, but depending on the crowd, Sushi Go might be the one I pull out.

A very light card game that is more entertaining than overrated ones like No Thanks!

Pros:

Cons:
* Adding up the scoring can be more involved than playing the game itself.
* The game does not include anyway to keep track of your score and you must resort to a piece of paper.

Really light card drafting game distilled down to it's core. It is a game to be played by family and kids. The cute art really impresses my fiancee. The game play is similar but very light compare to 7 Wonders and somewhat lighter and less strategy than Fairy Tale. I will be happy to play but don't think I need to own. The old art certainly looks better than the new one.

I am impressed by the designer again since I was delighted with his Archaeology the card game.

This is a quick and cute drafting game, where you try to collect different sets of sushi cards so that they score you the maximum points in each of three rounds. It plays like a much simplified 7 wonders game. The game doesn't have a ton of replayability, because over the course of a single game, you see most of the cards and pretty much every trick the game has to offer. Despite that it's a fun filler romp.

Card drafting for kids.  It's fun, I guess.  Was disappointed they went to a tin box, but that's my cross to bear.  I hate tin boxes.  The art was Americanized a little, but that's okay.  
BUT...there's drafting games I enjoy more.  Among the Stars is far better, mostly because you actually do something with the cards you draft instead of sitting them in front of you waiting to do math with them.  Lost Legends, 7 Wonders, the aforementioned Fairy Tale, hell, even Magic the Gathering...all better drafting games, but good luck getting your 10 year old to play any of them.  
Thus, I go Sushi.  Go.  You know what I mean.

If 7 Wonders was Fairy Tale complexified, Sushi Go! is Fairy Tale simplified. It passes the time but the different scoring routes are very bland; most cards end up scoring 2 or 3 points whatever you do, reminiscent of Tokaido.

In this game you are collecting sets of cards, or at least trying to, in a drafting manner.  Pass and play your hand until all the cards are down in your tableau.  Score em and repeat this three times.  Simple and very fun. Game you can play while you chat and have a drink with friends.

Fast, portable, and fun.  You can bang out games of Sushi Go in 10-15 minutes once every one has it down.  It is easy to teach and goes anywhere.  It is great choice for the light fast and fun niche in a game collection.  It's Super cute to boot.

6 - this might be closer to a 5.5 but I'll give it a 6 because of my gaming crew.  Playing the game at the gamewrightgames booth at PAX late at night after the floor had closed gave me a chance to try a set collection game I would probably have passed right by normally.  As someone who enjoys sushi, the theme is pretty good and you try to collect sets of sushi while pronouncing what your playing in terrible accents.  it's fairly fun and very light and even though the cards felt terrible at the con I chalk that up to the humidity and overall funk of the weekend.  I would have picked up a set while I was there during the "pre-purchase raffle" I didn't like it enough to pre-order a set to be mailed to me.  The art is adorable.  

I did eventually order the game when it showed up available for retail.

Sushi Go! is simplified version of the 7-Wonders. That is card draft and pass. You are trying to create collections of cards. Some score by themselves but have a bonus multiplier available. others require sets. The chopsticks allows you to play 2 at once at a later turn. You have to weigh what you are collecting versus what you are passing onto others. 
Nice combination of options for a light filler.

We got it as a simple filler with the cutest sushi faces we had seen, but we were in for a big surprise.
It's a great game, requiring both tactical and strategical decisions. It plays really fast though.
The messy scoring is maybe the weakest part.
It's very simple, a lot of fun, everybody loves it and everytime we take it we feel like playing two or three games in a row at least.
Highly recommended.

I was excited to try this game as I had heard good things about it, but I ended up disappointed.  There is very little strategy.  If the player on your right chooses the same card as you to build on you can just about forget making your set.  There are way better light games. I love drafting games, but this one is very bland.  May be OK for kids.

July 2015: We have 3 -M sets and the extra cards for each. I have one spare -V cardset... it'll get dealt with later. These are our 'give away' game now; replacing Fluxx.

Sushi go is a nice quick game to play, especially with kids.  The cards are pleasant to look at and very "kid friendly".  Small cute pieces of sushi smile back at you as you draft cards.

There is a mild feel of 7 Wonders with the alternate scoring for different set types, but it's not as complicated allowing younger players to play.  My little girl (age 5) loves this game, as she can play with very little assistance (actually she doesn't need any, now).

A short play time, low cost, and kid accessibility make this a game that's great for me to own.  I should say it's not a "kids game" in the sense that adults enjoy the game too.

I'm not sure why I'm so down on this game.  I enjoy drafting.  I'm not a big fan of set collection though...maybe that's why?

Maybe it's because I've heard so many people talk about how much they enjoyed this game so I expected to really like it.  It's the kind of game that I wish were over after the first round just because there isn't anything happening that I find interesting.

Meh...I can understand how people do like it, but it's not a game for me.

I do like Sushi Go Party! better - added variability and it's more user-friendly for large groups.

The platonic drafting game is a great intro to drafting mechanics, but after drafting MTG for years, it's a pretty pale experience.

This game has little to offer for experienced after a few plays. The decisions are pretty obvious, at least for me. To tell you the truth, the game experience becomes very boring after a few plays. This is like faster 7 wonders but it wears down after a few plays. 7 wonders easily held a couple dozen plays even without expansions.

This is a good game with non-gamers or in general people with little experience with board games, and that's the only situation I'll play this.

Recommended.

UPDATE: I've upped this from a 7.5 to an 8.  The kids really enjoy it, and the strategies are getting deeper and better with more plays.  And my kids are getting better at playing.  This is a very good game.

RATING: 3
an ok drafting game that messed up some basics of set collection.  As a result, it is all-too-often obvious what card to take, which removes interest from the game.  Imbalance in a drafting game isn't terrible, but this much is.

For example:
a card always worth 3 points
vs.
a card worth nothing unless in a set of 3, then worth 10

a card always worth 2
vs.
a card worth nothing unless in a set of 2, then worth 5

The cards that are the easiest to score are also the most (or close to the most) efficient.  Thus, there is no temptation to take risks on big sets.  Just take the best point card and move on.  Only after those are gone are there actually some choices (and a fair amount of card counting).

As far as fillers go, this is probably just about right. You can teach it quickly. By the end of the first scoring round everyone has a good grasp of the concept and the whole game can be played out very quickly.

29-03-2015. Rated after 2 plays. Sushi Go is a very quick and light drafting game. 

It plays over 3 rounds of drafting. Each round, you get a number of cards determined by the number of players. Then, you take 1 card and pass the rest to your opponents. Most of the cards just score you straight up points (nigiri), or the more you have the more points you get (dumplings). Maki Rolls give the player who has most 6 points, and the number 2 3. Some cards score you points if you get a set of at least 3 (sashimi) or 2 (tempura). Some cards (wasabi) are worth nothing, unless you put a nigiri on top. Then the value of the nigiri is trippled. Chopsticks are a bit complicated, and allow you to play two cards from the next hand in exchange for the sticks.

I like it a lot. The game is SOOO incredibly simple. But the artwork is incredibly cute. The game incredibly quick and the decisions, as always with drafting, interesting. Surprisingly fun and good game. Fun filler that will stay in my collection.

Sushi Go! is like 7 Wonders in terms of passing your hand around the table, but much faster and much more hunger-inducing. It is hard not to love the charm and rapid feel of this game.

If you are debating between this one and Sushi Go Party, it's a no brainer.  Get the Party Edition.

ORIGINAL EVALUATION - I suspect I may tire of this quickly, but so far our family is loving it.  Simple premise but enjoyable game.  Love the fact that there is virtually no setup/take down time so the 15 minute game is quite possible.

EDIT - As I suspected, I got tired because I tend to play one or two base strategies depending on the card distribution.  Dropped the ranking a point once I added Sushi Go Party to my collection and realized how much better this game could be.

Fantastic art, and I like the gameplay, too, although it really is very light - that makes it a hit with my family, though. 
I was not perfectly satisfied with the 2 player rules as written, playing with the 2 player variant by Peter Kinsley(PK1988) that adds a 3rd player and uses his hand as a draw pile has alleviated all my problems (blocking and counterblocking without getting anything done/collected).  
Missed the kickstarter campaign but the p & p files were still available so I made a travel sized copy with mini cards.

Edit: As another 2-player variant, I may try to just have every player draw a new card from a draw pile each turn like in Pleasant Prospect Farm.

This game literally fits the definition of "Soul-Crushingly boring." 

While teaching this game to my fiance I almost lulled myself to falling asleep, and instructions take about 15 seconds. 

Gameplay is barely competitive, essentially the only multiplayer element is "drafting" with no incentive to win. I would pay someone to take this off my hands.

PERFECT game for kids, literally that's about it.

RATING: 6
Simpler, purer card-drafting game than Fairy Tale, which means it's better, since too much time in Fairy Tale was spent totaling up your opponents' points and trying to understand what those icons were saying. Keeps the scoring rules simple so you can focus on the drafting.

Better with fake Japanese accents.

(one of the) simplest drafting game(s). 

My first impression was that this was Fairy Tale done right or set collecting drafting game done right - pretty accessible and straightforward, making it easy to pick up. Theme is approachable as well (I've played Zoch version, hey I like its visuals). 

After playing it my second impression was quite negative. [i]oh victory point salad, the card game[/i]. More or less every card you'll play will be worth around 2-3 points. If you'll be able to pull off wasabi + 3 point nigiri combo for 4,5 points per card your opponents are doing something wrong. Oh and sashimi set is 3,33 points per card. Wheee. The main problem of this drafting game is that it does not reward creating big sets, for significant risk involved in pulling off such a combo, rewards are minimal and other one+s best option is just to play nigiri. It's the same problem as with any VPS game - rewarding every move with approximately the same amount of points leads into tactical play as longer strategic paths are simply not viable or the risk of implementing them does not yield the appropriate rewards. As a result such a game lacks any proper tension. Or excitement. 

And yeah, I generally dislike drafting games as they mostly seem to be just another MPS variety. 
However I got this for kids gaming workshop as we needed something accessible and non-confrontational with as non existing learning curve as possible. And it works pretty okay in this context/niche.

RATING: 5
A very light drafting game with a focus on set collection. In fact, most of the cards are simply variants on scoring sets. The game lacks the tension of tricky decisions, and I really wouldn't bother with calculating the cost benefits of passing an opponent a certain card towards the end of the draft.

To be fair, it has some limited value as an introduction to the drafting mechanism. I also love its compact size and the artwork of both editions; I've never seen food so happy to be eaten!

Too many games in my collection were heavily immersive and took 1 or more hours to play through. I wanted something simple, quick and fun. I was not disappointed.

Sushi Go is literally my favorite game now. The cards have a very nice texture and the artwork is so cute, especially on the tin. The mechanic is very streamline and simple, only one card effect caused a bit of confusion (Chopsticks works on any card but a line in the rules say "You may take 2 sushi cards".

This is a great entry level and party game. You might even find it in a regular store (saw them at Target)

We bought this for my cousin's daughter and would have gotten it for Michelle's sister too, except that B&N ran out of copies. It looked like an interesting game and we wanted to try it out, so I was glad Michelle's sister got it for us as a gift. So far, it seems like a nice game, especially if we're strapped for time. There is a fair amount of luck, but that's to be expected in something like this. 

I don't think the 2p variant works well, unfortunately. It was fun for a few plays, but I don't think we're going to do it anymore. It plays much better with more anyway.

My wife keeps winning at this game; which makes her happy; which gives her bragging rights to endless light trash-talking post-game; which means I get to see this game played more often, 1 vs 1. 
I can't really complain, I guess. Happy wife, happy life. :)

...Now, if I can only find some way to get her to play Merchants & Marauders....

This is a really simple and quick drafting game.  There are 3 rounds and each round each player is dealt a hand of cards, picks one, and passes the rest along until all cards are drafted.  The cards each just provide points in different ways.  For example, sushi rolls reward points to the players with the most, wasabi will double the point value of the next nigiri played, many other dishes reward points only when a certain number are collected, etc.

This really is just a bit of a luck fest.  You spend the whole game just hoping you draft more valuable cards than your opponents.  You have no control over it outside of the chopsticks card which lets you trade it for two cards in one round.

It's a quick filler but it's not a very good one.

While Fairy Tale is a "deeper" card drafting game, Sushi Go! is a gem and an excellent gateway game into card drafting mechanics.  The theme is appealing to everyone and I've never had a game go bad.  No complaints, and I'm getting a hankering for wasabi just writing this.

Much to my surprise, I actually enjoyed this game.  It's about as stripped down a "card drafting" game as you can get, but I appreciate the economy of design and the complete lack of fluff.  The theme is creative, though not to my "tastes" (see what I did there?).  (I don't hate sushi, but I don't love it either.)  The artwork is pretty horrible, in my subjective opinion, but the simple visuals seem to fit with the minimalist design.  At the end of the day, much like sushi for me, this is a great filler in small doses, but definitely not a main course!  Game design: 4/5  Personal enjoyment: 2.5/5  Total: 6.5/10

pfctsqr: "Just a warning about Sushi Go!. It's...alright...with two. You can either just deal 10 cards per player and trade hands back and forth. Or use the "dummy hand" variant recommended in the rules. Without the dummy hand, its not very tense at all just exchanging the same two hands back and forth. But at the same time, the dummy hand adds a bit of unwelcome "fiddliness" for a game of this weight. Jaipur is a better game of this "type" for two players. I really do like Sushi Go, but it really needs three players to be any good."

Up the rating by one point for kids. Good solid drafting game, with reasonable enjoyment. Would not mind playing it again, but won't suggest it. Too lightweight to my tastes, but as a family game it can be a winner. 

Will take it on vacation though, as it is small and a nice addition to the 'vacation family game time' pack.

I usually hate drafting. I don't mind drafting as a mechanic, just not drafting being the whole game. I dislike 7 wonders, but for some reason I enjoy this. It plays quickly and doesn't over stay it's welcome, the art is great too.

RATING: 7.5
Wow! This is drafting boiled down to its essence, and then given a very appealing and fitting theme. It pits the players against each other from the go. Really great with 3 players, since you see the same pile of cards several times. 4 players reduced this factor enough for me to keep it as a 3-player game only.

What's with all the sushi games? Sushi Go, [thing=142334][/thing], [thing=144865][/thing]...
Yes, this is [thing=68448][/thing] style drafting without the depth. Draft, score cards based on the type. Each type is scored in it's own distinctive way. Perfectly entertaining, but don't expect a lot of depth.

Another game that clearly follows on from the success of 7 Wonders. This time, it's more push your luck, more random, much faster and has fewer rules.

I love Sushi, so I'm giving it a 6 instead of a 5.  This is a super simple, quickly playing set collection game that basically scores points off of how well you can combo cards together.  You pick a card out of your hand and pass it to the left, and pick up the next hand and pick a card out of that.  Simple and quick!  And all the sushi is smiling at you.

Excellent for a quick game, and is something you can take to a party or gathering and non-gamers can get into and enjoy. Simple rules with end-of-round and game points tallying mean you don't always know who will win until the final round. Since each round starts with new cards everyone has equal opportunity to make up points towards the final tally. The cards are also very pretty!

the best basic introduction to draft you can think of.

Start with this, and you'll be ready in a few plays for 7 wonders, Fairy Tales or other slightly more complex drafting games.

Of course, it doesn't have the depth of more complex titles, but it must be judged for what it is: a nice filler you can play almost everywhere.

The game is simplistic perfection!  My family loves it.  I wish I hadn't waited so long to get it.  In a rare event, after 7 years of playing various games, my 11 year old daughter said, "I really like this one.  Let's play again!"  Music to a game-dad's ears.  (a single, crystal-like, tear falls to the tabletop)....

Buy it!  It's the best family game deal out there.  Cute art, easy to learn, fast play, great theme, and nice tin box.  Actually, tin boxes are nice, but they don't stack.

My suggestion to say the name of the card when everybody flips.  You'll hear a great chorus of "chopsticks!" "wasabi!" "dessert!"

Sushi Go! Is GREAT! It's fast, fun, the art is great, there is a fair amount of strategy, and scoring isn't very complicated. Kids can play, and it's fun for adults as well. Can be played at a pub even, though you do need a little bit of space to play. You choose one card to keep, and pass the rest of your hand to the next person on and on until there aren't any cards left, and then you score. 3 rounds to a game and you declare the winner. ~15 minutes to play

Culled - First wave; Gifted to Elissa

Why we culled it: Sushi Go is a great little drafting game. It is very accessible, features interesting game-play decisions, and has some adorable artwork. It has long been a favorite for more casual nights. That said, most of our friends have it already, and we rarely engage with it on our own because we prefer more meaty drafting games. So we gifted it to our niece's family, where it will remain a big hit for the foreseeable future. Win-win.

Though I would never actually ingest any of this, I would never refuse a game of this light , fast and fun card game.

A card drafting game,  Sushi Go will most likely appeal to a broad range of tastes and preferences. That accessibility is the game's strong suit as it is a rather simple affair. 

Given the premise and it's contents,  the key to the charm in this one may well be baffling.  For me though,  this game works on every level and is my go to drafting game.

Despite it's title,  I virtually guarantee that a purchase of this game will never be considered a raw deal.

This seems to have got a lot of notice for itself, and I'm not really even sure why. It's a drafting game with set collecting as the scoring mechanic. I don't think that much of it but it's so quick you can't hardly argue with it either. It does what it does, and passes some time while waiting for a game to wrap on another table or something like that. 

[ImageID=554375]
I feel certain people will say they love this game with two players, but for me, it actually takes away from the game which doesn't have all that much going for it in the first place. 10 cards in hand you can at the start of the round pretty much just take what cards you want. It might work with a variant like that used in [thing=110277][/thing] which works there nicely. The idea is you deal a 3rd neutral hand and randomly discard one card from that hand each turn. That will upset the balance of what you pass.

Sushi Go is a lightweight drafting/set collection game.  You never know what cards are in play, and (except for a special situation) never get to keep more than one card you're drafting.  Some cards pay off only if you get the whole set, while others just bag points outright.  For how simple it is and how quickly it plays, this is a pretty sharp little game.  The artwork makes this look like a kid's game, and it's simple enough that kids can enjoy it too, but there's enough meat here to be a gamer's filler game.

[thing=133473][/thing] is a light, very light draft game, one that feels like a kids version of [thing=68448][/thing] and [thing=13823][/thing].

The gameplay is pretty simple: choose a card, pass the others. Most of the cards connect to others, so you will be looking for those once you start a thing. Most of the cards score for themselves, but others - the Maki Roll and the Pudding score differently. For the Maki Roll, the player with the most icons of it scores 6 points and the second with the most icons scores 3. The Pudding is the only card that passes through rounds. By the end of the game, the player with the most Puddings scores 6 points and the player with the least Puddings receives a penalty of -3 points.

By the way, it took a couple of plays to learn that the Maki Roll and the Puddings are a trap. A TRAP! Well, if you can avoid the penalty with one card, or gain a second place of the Maki with one, maybe two, it might be worth it. Otherwise, especially considering the early game, going for them is mostly a bad move. I saw fights for the Maki going with 3, 4 cards - even if the player wins, it will be worth, at best, 1,5 to 2 points per card commited - and it can be way less. Even an average Nigiri is worth 2 points, [i]guaranteed[/i]. Late in the round, I would also lower a Maki instead of going for a Sashimi, but, even then, could be better to pass it in order to keep the fight going. It is basically the same as the Military in [thing=68448][/thing] - can be worth it, but only if you can get the points with the least amount of cards possible.

Anyway, [thing=133473][/thing] is extra-light, fat free game. Almost all you do in a round, except the points, won't carry to the next one - the exception, as I mentioned, are the Puddings. So things doesn't really escalate and build up to a strong finish, with some great combos and bottom of the 9th points coming. No. The third round will mostly the same as the first, and the second.

The game is quick and the decisions, though not really hard, happens throughout, as is usual for drafting games and why so many people like them (like me). The interaction between players is there, mostly in the form of blocking cards the others want, and in the Maki and Pudding scoring. Light stuff - hardly someone will feel angry. I enjoyed the Chopsticks card, which allows the player to pick two cards later on by taking one worth nothing now. Easy and efficient.

The art if cute and all the cards and rules fit a small tin box. I like small boxes, but the tin ones aren't the easiest ones to accommodate - they do feel like an upgrade over cardboard boxes.

So [thing=133473][/thing] is a good family game, and works pretty well as a filler with no real commitment to things like paying a lot of attention or developing some strategy. But I surely won't prefer this over [thing=68448][/thing] nor [thing=13823][/thing], but both of these are harder to teach and take some more time to play, so these might not fit so well with non-gamers.

RATING: 7
Drafting game like 7 Wonders and Fairy Tale (which are credited). No player interaction stemming from what you draft except for a couple of majorities comparisons (which seem quite vital). (I.e., nothing like buying resources from your neighbor, or forcing them to flip over their cards as unusable.)

It's fun and plays very fast, though I am skeptical that the routes to scoring points are balanced in terms of viability and risk. The collective deal for a given round (out of the deck as a whole) also seems random enough that you may make decisions early on in a round that turn out to be terrible once you have seen all the hands in play.

Interesting mechanic is the chopsticks card: You play it in preparation for playing two cards at once on a later play. But when you play the two cards, the chopsticks goes back into circulation, so that ultimately, somebody will be forced to play the card (which has no value) with no ability to use it.

...Tried playing (3p) where at the beginning of each round all players inspect the card distribution. Seems pretty typical that the sashimi, I think (the ones that only score when you play three), is a bad bet or even impossible. If you see somebody pursuing that, a single hate draft will probably hose them.

This variant made the game feel less random, but I also feel decisions become nearly automatic. The only reason I can give it a 7 is that it plays lightning fast.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A card set collection game where you are dealt a hand of cards, take one and reveal it, and then pass your hand to the next person. The passing of the cards is a new mechanism to me, and I like what it introduces. It's more effective with three or more players. There's a fair amount of luck with what cards come up. A lot don't, and you might want/need them. You try set a strategy with your hand, but won't know if it's even possible until you've seen all hands. You have to be flexible.

  The new artwork a bit disappointing, but at least the Tin is nice.  But I Cherish my first run copy!!

Juego rápido de cartas en el que tenemos que preparar un menú de sushi. Para ello se roba una mano inicial y se elige una carta de la mano, se juega y se pasa las cartas a la mano del siguiente jugador y recibimos las cartas de otro jugador. Ahi está la gracia del juego. Es divertido pensar en cual puede ser la estrategia del contrario pero a la vez no tener mucho control sobre las cartas.

If you want a family friendly drafting-type game, look no further. Sushi Go has appealing artwork and such simple gameplay, that all casual gamers I played this with enjoyed it.

RATING: 6
Card drafting game strip to the core, this game utilizes the same mechanic like 7 Wonders and Fairy Tale, but at the most bare bones level. In fact, playing this 15 min game feels like a toddler version of 7 wonders on training wheels. This does not automatically mean the game is dreadful, rather there is a surprising charm to the simplicity and non superfluous game play. It is also true that the game will likely overstay it's welcome if played frequently, but the point of keeping this filler in the closet is to occasionally pull it out to fill the gaps between game play or to drag non-gamers into our hobby. I like Sushi Go, if only in small doses.

I enjoyed playing, in-as-much as I tend to enjoy drafting games and I like 7 Wonders.  But the only time I can see wanting to play this RATHER than 7 Wonders is if it was a group I felt I couldn't expect to understand 7 Wonders.  That's a pretty narrow classification of people.

Also, every time I get stuck with chopsticks at the end, I feel like I got hot-potatoed with no defense possible, which is not great.

Very light, but very quick and fun as well.  Takes just a few minutes to explain the scoring, and the game really flies along.  Being a game all about drafting, every person is involved in every turn.

I really enjoyed it, despite being cursed with a horrific short-term memory.  Once everyone gets the game, it's really a crazy fast-moving that delivers a novel gaming experience.  With everyone grabbing decks, slapping down choices and passing on again.  While you're eyeballing all of your choices and what your opponents are doing while taking quick guesses on what strategy to go for.

It definitely shows it's lightness if you play it more than once or twice in a row.  The game is meant for random, occasional time killing.

7 Wonders with smiling puddings. Especially taking its size into account, this really is a work of game design genius. Works well, easy to teach, a perfect introduction to drafting. The random cards can cause bizarre situations where there's only one "thing you need the most of in this round" in the whole deck, as just one example, so it isn't perfect. But it trades this for simplicity, and sometimes such situations are worth laughing about. There's also math. Your mileage may vary on that. Overall, I recommend it, especially to play on trips with family or non-gaming friends.

Majority score/penalty.

Designed by Australian Phil Walker-Harding and funded on Indiegogo, Sushi Go! is very much Fairy Tale/7 Wonders inspired, but just a nice, quick version of them. With no player board or intricate actions as per the previous two games, Sushi Go! is about collecting sets of various Japanese delicacies in order to score. The art is cute in the extreme and again, it fills a filler/non-gaming session space for me. I like having games in this space as they can be great introductions for people impromptu, hopping over the added step of getting them along to a full games session.

RATING: 8
Super cute!

This is a card drafting game, a la 7 Wonders, but much simpler. The goal is to assemble various kinds of sets that are each scored differently, similar to games like Ra. Some lucrative sets are scored all-or-nothing, leading to a push-your-luck vibe. There are also a couple special ability cards thrown in that multiply the points of future cards (wasabi) or allow you to draft two cards at once (chopsticks).

It's light, fast, and a bit derivative. The art is the killer feature though and makes the whole package a winner. It's just so dang cute.

Update: Bumping this from 7 to 8 since it just keeps hitting the table week after week. This has become our go-to filler or night cap game. :-)

RATING: 7.5
Super quick drafting game.  I wouldn't label it as light, there is definitely some depth to the game.  This is more of the game that you would use to introduce non-gamers to drafting.  Plus the theme usually goes over well with most people.

Sushi Go! is a delightfully quick and simple drafting game which I like to refer to as "7 Wonders Lite". In fact, the more I play it, the more I tend to think it may end up replacing 7 Wonders for me, simply because it creates a very similar experience but with less set up and a few less rules to fiddle with.

The production of the new Gamewright edition is wonderful. The art style is adorable while being bold, stylish and of professional quality.

This makes for a great game for non-gamers but also has enough going on, I feel, to appeal to more seasoned players who want to get a little tricky with different drafting strategies.

This is a drafting game much like Fairy Tale (and to a lesser degree, 7 Wonders). Like Fairy Tale, it's a short game (potentially playable in 15 minutes) and as a result it doesn't do a ton for me. The art is adorable and I like how the cards score differently, but I'm not a huge fan of fillers, hence the low rating.

This is a fairly simple card drafting game. The players pick a card from their hand and pass the rest of the hand to the next player until the hand is exhausted ending the round different types of sushi require different numbers of the same type to score points. At the end of three rounds the player with the most point wins. This is a simple game and without too much frill which makes it easier to teach. Sometimes the card drafting concept is difficult to grasp, but after that the game is a lot of fun.

Fast set collection draft card game. Pick one, pass cards, play one. Repeat. Simple fun at its best. Watch what others are doing to see if you can make that sushimi X 3 or make a wild run on dumplings, while deciding if (and when) to keep those end scoring pudding. You don't even need to like sushi to get into it, when you play chopsticks and yell "Sushi Go!".  Warning, it will make you hungry, and you will not be able to help speaking in Japanese accents.

Very light, very easy and pretty fun filler. It's meant to be an introduction to drafting games for non-gamers. Ok with 3 players,  need to try it with 4 players before final evaluation.

A fun introduction to drafting. But in truth, there's really not a lot of meat here. The artwork will draw new players in which is great, but experienced gamers will definitely find it very empty compared to other drafting games.

But, thanks to the approachable appearance, I generally have brand new gamers do at a game or two of this before sneaking them over to 7 Wonders.

This is a fast little card drafting filler.  There seem to be a number of viable drafting strategies (or at least a number of different ways to score points for cards) for something so light and with smaller numbers of players whoever can remember what's coming up in each hand has a good, but not insurmountable, advantage. This played out fast with my game group... or perhaps was just replaced by more meaty new card drafting games... but my kids still really like it so I still play once in a while when they request it.

Great gateway game to introduce players to the concepts involved with 7 Wonders, which is one of my favorite games but can be difficult to teach to new players. That's what I got this game for and it does the job beautifully.

Changed rating from 7.5 to 8 because this suits all groups and everyone very well, so easy to teach and replay immediately.

Psychedelic Candyland. Save your $ for an 1/8th of the real thing and some headphones to listen to Pink Floyd. Ridiculously way too long with no interesting choices to be made. Board is cool as fuck though.

RATING: 7
A game that shows extraordinary fidelity to its theme, a shamanic ritual involving psychoactive substances.  It is fitting that the players are represented by a single pawn on the board, which travels a path through intense moments, chanted mantras and periods of recuperation.  The way that the board unfolds to reveal new sections of the path is brilliant.  Underlying all this are some solid euro-ish mechanisms in which resources (two kinds of energy) are managed, there's a sort of area control, and various things that offer vp's are gathered.  My one real reservation is that the game plays long - both of my sessions have been well over the 90 minutes claimed - and by the end it becomes a bit repetitive.

The artwork is extraordinary, both the 3D stuff on the board and the bad trip images on everything else.  Production quality is good.  The rules are quite hard work and the set-up could have used better illustrations of the components.

RATING: 4
Thematically, very neat. Very cool art. Theme that hasn't been explored. 

That said, the actual gameplay is a bit unsatisfying. Play a card, move some distance. Unfold the board. Go off on a side quest.

It felt very much like a roll-and-move, and like I was just collecting piles of things to count up at the end of the game. 

I feel like the game doesn't punish you enough for not maintaining your sanity, and is about an hour too long. It doesn't help that in our one play, we played "talking" incorrectly, causing each card draw to go all the way around the table, but I don't even think that would have helped.

Psychedelic Candyland. :P

But with lots of strategy. The gameplay itself is
interesting, in that you're facing a complex tableaux,
and trying to predict/guess what your opponents' likely
actions are - and then optimize your own choices based
on them. Each player has a single hand of points, which
gets refreshed whenever you run out - so in order
to optimize, you have to plan ahead against projections.

But the gameplay is simply not why you're going to play
this one. It's an experience game. And that experience is
best gleaned in the first playing, as you try and 'catch
up' to the strategy in the strange world of your shared trip.
If it was the gameplay alone, it wouldn't be worth the
headachey mind-bending aspect - but that IS a key part
of the whole experience.

RATING: 6
This is the most impressive "art as a game" game that I've played, where the "art" part of the game really tackles the theme well and tosses you into the weirdness of it, and the "game" part is a half way decent game.

Mechanically, players are advancing a shared pawn down a path, where the landing space of the pawn dictates what action everyone will participate in.  Most of the time, the entire group will get to do something, and some times, only one or two players are involved.  Sometimes players will even go on personal journeys, where they now are doing something other than the group.  It's how well you manage those "outside of the group" activities that will dictate if you can score more points than them or not.

Thematically, all sorts of whacked out stuff is going on.  You'll battle the intensity of the trip, awaken to new knowledge, have weird communications, respond to environmental changes, understand mantras, collect paradox, etc.  Oh, and you'll wear 3D glasses for the game, which makes everything in the game trippy looking.  While the theme is pasted on to a basic underlying points scoring system, it's pasted on with really awesome glue.

Overall, it's worth playing to experience for it's weirdness, and maybe I'll pull it out once a year to re-experience it.  But, it is pretty long for what it is, and is "fine" as a game.  The allure is really the subject matter and how the game handles it.

An art house design by the revered Nate Hayden.  Seeks to elevate the medium above its traditional boundaries and succeeds.  This is to be marveled at and respected in a similar way to the films Metropolis or 8 1/2.

At a first glance it looks like a simple game with weird graphics. After playing a couple of turns, the concepts of the game become clear and you start to realize there is a lot going on in this game. Then, halfway through the game it all comes together and it feels like a collective hallucinary journey, with different moodswings, bad trips, etc.
Not for everybody, but a great experience if you're willing to give it a try.

RATING: 9.5
This game was my best purchase at Essen 2013. Thematically it feels perfect to me, and as a piece of artwork a joy to own.

It won't stretch your gaming group in strategic thinking, but there is enough complexity to maintain interest and the game is more about an unfolding experience anyway - so you can just sit back and enjoy the ride.

You can make this game long or short, depending on how involved everyone gets. In our first play we lingered long in the early stages, absorbed in the experience, then, when we saw the end in sight (and felt the need for Pizza) we rattled through at speed.

Very pleased to own - a unique gem.

After After Pablo, another game with an not-so-ordinary theme.

I'm not sure about this one. We had the impression that is is very hard to collect paradoxes and wisdom because you tend to lose it again on the orange action spots of the action path. The game seemed very chaotic to us.

Everytime if you collected some power to handle the red 'intense moments' someone put the pawn on the lose power action and spoils the moment for all of us.

Maybe we're playing something wrong, but our 'experience' was not the best we ever had.

Fortunately we have After Pablo, an absolutely great game!

Mushroom Eaters won't make your head ache from calculations of efficiency but it will leave you howling at the moon!

Mechanically Mushroom Eaters is very simple - play a card move the pawn react to the conditions of the space.  There are subtle strategies at play - what do I need to maintain my fortitude through the upcoming barrage of intense moments, do I play for the greater awareness of the paradox at hand or just be complacent with smaller awakenings- but none to taxing as the game will take you were it wants to.

This last point may make the game sound to on rails for some. But it is exactly this point that makes Mushroom Eaters the brilliance it is.  

Players play nominees for the position of future shaman and at the onset of the game share in a psilocybin laced concoction.  From there players follow a path together, communally sharing experiences as the drug takes hold.  The manner in which you choose to react, how far along the path you choose to venture, all unfold the experience.  

The thin veil of control you are given is thematic genius.  I am not sure people without experience with hallucinogens would quite understand it, but for those of you that have you will quickly understand what is at play here.  You are not the master of the trip - the plants are.  They show you what they want you to see. Can you handle it? Or will you leave a trembling shell of your former self?  

Although the game in a sense plays you - it changes everytime. As close to a psychedelic experience as I can imagine a game becoming.  

Mushroom Eaters is a true work of art that transcends the board and communicates a difficult (misunderstood) subject matter better than most of the other attempts I have encountered in any medium.

Nate Hayden is a true force in modern game design, and Mushroom Eaters continues his amazing lineage.

Heavy, man.

I really admire the designer for realising such a truly independent and rigorous vision while still succeeding in making a good game. This ignores the hype and commercial momentum of the board game industry and manages to be like nothing else. Deeply thematic, utterly strange, and borderline genius.

I can love an ugly game (I'm looking at you, [thing=118][/thing]), but I strongly appreciate good aesthetics, and this game has an incredible aesthetic. A game about taking a spiritual hallucinogenic trip that is so absorbing and surreal that you actually feel like you've taken one.

The Talking rules are a bit confusing. I'm tempted to go back to the first edition rules for the sake of slightly simplifying Talking (where you give a Talking card to another player, they apply effects, then take another talking card to give to a player who hasn't had one yet, and so on until all players have been "Talked" to - no board involved).

The play time on the box is a lie. This is a 2-3 hour game. In fact, I played it once with 5 players and we had to skip a chunk of the board to keep it to 3 hours.

Crowdfunded in July 2014, received March 2015.

RATING: 7.51
Today (essen friday 2013) i played the [thing=135508][/thing] and it was a weird trip :). I didn't get a copy but almost all of the eindhoven gamers did. Will be hard to get to the table though as it is an experience game that involves handmanagement. If you are in that kind of stuff... It runs a little long though, but player time should go down a lot after the first play. At that point you are familiar with the game. Anyway I have tales of arabian nights for my experience games. And that's enough for me. However if i didn't have one. i think i might pick this because the theme, board and gameplay go sort of hand in hand. And the personal trip mechanic in the game is way cool.

it's close to an 8 for me. But because it will be hard to get to the table should i have my copy. i give it a 7. Mind you most of us while playing the first turns thought what is this. but after a few turns and some things have happened everything makes sense and you can play with strategy. there is some luck involved, since you can go on a bad trip or good trip. but it entirely fits the theme.

i rated it a 7.51. i rated it a 3 after a few turns. Rated it a 7 after playing. And while writing down my thoughts a 7 isn't enough.

update: i rate this an 8 now. I want to play it again now.

second game. better understanding meant playing the faces and paradoxes more. if there is no competition in face you will win the game. still like it a lot but rating got lowered to 7.51 again

Absolutely succeeds at what it intended to do, which is create an experience. Not for the public game nights, this is a game that needs people to get into the mood.

We played that if you go on your own trip, you wear the 3D glasses. Helped us to see/remember who would be affected by landing where you land.

Apparently a "spiritual" experience game, where you wear 3D glasses and the psychedelic board unfolds throughout the game.  The game encourages players to take journeys in which things may go very well or very bad for you.  Seems so avant-garde it's probably right up my alley.

Man, this is probably the most wonderful game I bought at Spiel 2013. Immediately played it the next day and we a great time.

This is one of the most atmospheric games I've ever played.

The foldable board works brilliant together with the 3d glasses. It's the only boardgame I know where 3d glasses really add to the playing feel. There was no 'waiting on other players to take a turn' because I was happily gazing at the board in the meantime. I bet this game is as close to a trip as a boardgame can get. Most of us were giggling, gazing and behaving like we were actual trippers.... (we were sober and without any drugs)


Glad I was on time in Essen for the boxed version.

My star of Essen 2013.  This game is pure awesome with a side dis of coolness.  The 3-D board and cards, the foldable map for the paths, the multitude of far out concepts.  When we started, we feared a disaster: was this just a disguised roll and move?  But no, there is really a game in there, a game with a huge number of currencies, and some real options of strategic play coupled with pure chance and always a psychadelic hysterical edge of giggling peeping out.  Audacious, controversion, bizarre and plain nuts.  My best pick of the show.

A further play was just as fun as the first.

This is the most precious piece of art I own. It's not for everyone but I can't get enough of it. Then add to that a fantastic game that would stand on its own if stripped of all its overwhelming flavor. The group is heading towards a sequence of "intense moments" and with your nervous system not completely in shape for that, you escape into a private trip to cower out the storm. But the sidetrip revolves around an insight like "We will decay" or "All of us are alone together" and you're like "No, I want the 'Beauty is breathing' I got last time, the one with the flowers, peace and focus cubes" but you can't choose the path, only your steps.

RATING: 7.5
A deeply thematic experience - so much so that I am not sure how much... game is in there. I enjoyed myself, and the game definitely evokes a story, but it felt sometimes like I didn't really know what is going on.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
First the good points: the art work is tremendous and the 3D effects (glasses are supplied in the game) are truly stunning; the theme works well in as far as you are on a "trip" on which you can do little to change the outcome; the game board unfolds in sections showing you the next part of your trip.
On the downside the game is far, far too long as you play all 10 sides of the boards. With minimal choices the game drags after the first hour or so to the extent that I cannot be bothered trying to win.
So it was a bad trip for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Completely different than anything else I've ever played. The use of a single pawn to move everyone (unless someone is on a Personal Path) means that you are helping and hurting both yourself and everyone else at the same time. So, we have a co-op/conflict thing going on all at the same time because you still want to have the most VPs at the end, but you don't want to feed VPs to your opponents.

My only real complaint is that the second to last panel is filled with Talking actions. The talking board action simply takes too long in my opinion, and by the time you're that close to the end, slowing the game down is a real drag. Playing with 5 (which I realize is 2 too many), this added at least an hour to the end. 

Other than the above complaint, I have to say, this is a brilliant design and Nate Hayden should be extremely proud of it. There's simply nothing else like it.

In all honesty, the game is currently a "Will play sporadically if in the right mood" in my book. But then again, a rating of ONLY 6 would be totally misleading, so I refuse to rate it. This is a very VERY special game that seems to dive deeper into intellectual spheres than any other game I ever heard of. Stripped down to pure mechanisms, it's rather ordinary. But then, who cares for mechanisms. Ask me after my fourth or fifth play again, maybe.

RATING: 3
Okay, so I wasn't expecting some tight Euro when I played this but the game was too long (much longer than the stated 90 minutes) for what was basically a cycle of getting tokens and losing tokens, moving cubes up and moving cubes back down again, placing cubes and removing cubes, much of it involuntary because of the shared shaman pawn. The novelty of the 3-D and prismatic glasses plus the board's weird but sketchy artwork seemed like a distraction tactic for a substandard game.

This game is weird!
Together the players go on a journey in the depths of our though influenced by mushrooms. In the game you can wear 3D-glasses and that makes the game even weirder and just as cooler.
At a players turn he plays a card and that many spaces the whole group goes forward on the journey where a benefit or a test is expected. You will get knowledge and paradoxes and who has most at game's end is the successor of the old shaman, thus the winner.
The atmosphere of this game makes it really fun. Apart from the journey together you can also 'meditate' on your own, I think I did this a bit too much and was away from the group too often. At those moment I did not care too much what was going on. Going together is more fun!
Weird, awesome and surprising game with lovely folding panels and matching art. A game one should try.

From first read of rules it looks like it could be a modern version of the Indian morality path games - but with meangiful decisions. Looking forward to trying. Board looks v psychedelic with the special glasses on.

RATING: 6
Man, this is a tricky one.

I'm basically a Eurogamer. On one level, this is a simple game of playing cards to move a shared pawn down a long track, performing the individual or shared action each place you stop. Throw in a few ways to score VP, a few resources to manage, a few tracks to keep topped up, and there you have it. It actually reminded me of Knizia's Beowulf near the end.

In Mushroom Eaters, the game itself is less significant than the theme & artwork. The concept is superb - for once we're dealing with an individual's path to personal enlightenment rather than becoming the best trader, fighter or satisfying some king.

Where I have a problem is that the artwork matches my instinctive (taught?) feelings towards drug use - the game is dark & depressing, almost [i]too[/i] evocative, but becomes great fun if you adopt a stoner hippy / Scooby Doo approach.

I couldn't get my Scooby Doo thing going in the face of so much darkness. So: a game that feels very true to its theme. [i]Too[/i] true to its theme for me.

Having said all that ... I'd like to play it again.

I'd lighten up - and adopt a less risk-averse approach, focusing less on maintaining nervous system energy and more on faces & drums.

Certainly felt like a unique game, though. I can't recall being so emotionally connected with a game before.

This did not work for me at all, though other groups have reported different results.

I *love* the art and the design - the unfolding board is a work of genius that I'm surprised that I haven't seen replicated since, but we found no engaging gameplay at all. The game continuously made you work for rewards that you then lost almost immediately and none of the decisions were ever fun or interesting. A real miss for me and a surprising one considering how much I've enjoyed all of Nate's other designs.

This will be sold off (at or below cost) as I did with After Pablo and someone else will get rich off it in a few years. That's fine with me.

As a work of art, I'd rate this very highly.  As a game, I still like it a great deal, but it needs a special group to really click, I think.  
As a simulation of a mushroom experience, it's pretty impressive!  There's a real sense of being swept along through ebbs and flows, with thoughts and feelings coming and going.  If you try to work any one strategy too hard there's a good chance you'll end up a nervous wreck.  Does that make for a great game?  Kinda.  Does it make for a very evocative experience?  Certainly.
I'd almost say that this would be decent with more casual players if not for the talking rules, which Nate Hayden thankfully made a video to explain.  As they're written they're pretty damn tricky to parse.

I guess I'm glad I played it for the experience, but I don't need to play it again. We quit with at least an hour left to go, because it was too late at night and a couple of us needed to go home.

Incredible. Each player has the ability to decide their own co-op or competitive levels (to an extent). Want to be helpful? Want to hinder the others? Want to be selfish? Maybe all of the above? All this tied into the most unique theme I've seen. It takes about 2-3 hours for a game, but I don't mind that one bit. It's obviously a labor of love in every regard, which just makes me appreciate the whole thing even more.

This game sticks with me. I think about it every now and then, months after playing it. Maybe some won't find the game mechanics as deep as they would like, but the depth of the subject matter sure as hell will be.

RATING: 6
A game that is an experience first, and a game second.  Mechanically and strategically, the game is not particularly interesting, and even somewhat degenerate.  The gameplay is centered around a track which the group progresses down.  In most cases, a track is a lazy game design choice, but here it works as an extension of the theme.  The board literally unfolds as the story metaphorically unfolds.  There's a ton of care put into this game, from the art to the rulebook.  It's clear that this is a labor of love.  It leads to a very surreal experience, one that is very effective at evoking a psylocybin trip.  It's definitely not a game I would recommend to everybody, and it's not a game that is especially replayable, but it IS a game that is worth checking out if you enjoy seeing how an auteur like Nate Hayden is interested in pushing the art form of board games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
This is less a game than it is an interactive art piece.  I'll give it credit for doing something unique (the 3D glasses are less for the 3D parts of the board, and more for making it look even trippier than it already does), but there's just not much game going on here.  Plus, even though all the players are looking out for themselves, the game has a cooperative, puzzle-solving feel to it that I just don't like.

Original theme with neat artwork.  The mechanics sort of go with the various thematic events.  Strategy mostly consists of jacking up your resources and then trying to withstand what is thrown at you.  A bit random.  Still it's a nice break from the typical games.

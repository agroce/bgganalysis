You must solve a series of riddles and puzzles to escape from a room. Each correct solution brings you to another riddle. How fast can you escape the room? This game can be played only once, because you markup, fold, and tear the game materials.

RATING: 3.5
This is, currently, our least favorite out of the three Exit: The Game titles we've played. Some of our distaste for this one was that they used some of the same gimmicks as previous games but just covered it up with new obfuscated clues. Additionally, for a few of the puzzles we had identified what was needed for a solution, but struggled with what the game wanted us to do with the various materials. This struggle seemed largely due to the game's production as opposed to the difficulty of the puzzles themselves. In other words, the puzzles would have been more enjoyable if they had made better decisions on how to present the puzzles to the players (the theme could have shown through more if they made better decisions in production, too), For example, some of the cards should have been without borders, should have been presented as a page to cut up, or been presented as something more thematic. As another example, some components should have been larger and/or more rigid. As a whole, we found this one more frustrating than fun, despite a number of the puzzles being clever.  

As another way to frame the disappointment of this title, the Abandoned Cabin had a number of puzzles that did a good job of simulating trying to escape from a locked room (like a real exit room). This title, and to less of an extent the Pharaoh title, focuses more on showing how "clever" the designers can be with some cards, a booklet, a box and a small punchboard. I find the latter to be much less enjoyable than the former.

We'll play at least one more of these titles, since we do like the exit room concept, but if they just continue to rehash the same gimmicks and/or continue to cause the players to fight against the puzzles' presentation, we will soon be done with this series.

RATING: 4
I've enjoyed other Exit games, but this one wasn't so good.  Whereas the others were tricky, but eventually we cracked them, with this one we spent a great deal of time being frustrated, then checking the hint cards and not seeing how the initial clues were of help.  An unfortunate entry in an otherwise fun series.

Unsure if we've just running out of steam having played 5 of the 6 Exit games out there as of writing this, but felt that this didn't quite live up to the original 3. Still had a blast playing it, but I didn't feel this particular scenario had as much variety in the puzzles as others. Still rated the game 8/10, so far from bad - just think others in this series are better.

Was fun! One of the puzzle was a big painful and it was great we were 3 of us playing. We didn't think the last puzzle was as difficult/clever as some others. I liked it quite much overall. Dat riddle card (if you know what I mean).

Another really interesting set of puzzles and again at a good level for the daughter to activly be involved.
 I am a bit dissapointed in one of the puzzles in this, where although we were doing the right thing we still were not getting the answer...indeed ever looking at the solution card we struggled to make the page line up correctly to solve the puzzle. This killed the pace of the game somewhat and was a little frustrating, but otherwise more new and different puzzles, and an enjoyable time for all.

If you want the experience of an escape room game in the comfort of your own home this is about as close as you can get. The castaway theme is strong with this one as you try to figure out how to escape. The variety of puzzles is really good and for the most part very cleverly implemented. Be warned this can only be played once as you will be forced to destroy components as you go, however the low price point makes this pretty painless.

RATING: 6.5
After playing 5 Exit and 6 Unlock! games, I’m starting to get a sense of deja vu...

The puzzles reused the gimmicks of the Abandoned Cabin and Pharoahs tomb, but it is strangely less fun compared to the two. Most of the puzzles are also focused on creating numbers through handicraft, which overstays its welcome here IMO.

For the same theme of islands and pirates, Unlock! The Tonipal’s Treasure is definitely more fun. However, this Exit game is still decent for first timers and worth a try.

This was hard, fun – sometimes even funny – and absolutely fair. We (two players) needed 1 hour and 45 minutes (and one hint card, which still left us in the dark for 20 minutes). Really, really good. Would like to play this again (therefore a ten), but, well, have to play another one in this series ...

Played with three - this seems to me about the ideal player count.  Most of the puzzles in this particular game seemed to be a touch on the easier side, though some took some time and work to actually solve and a lot had a bit more physicality than you might expect - we ran over the hour but also took almost no clues.  The final puzzle in particular was a bit fiddly and overall the game lacked an signature "Ah hah!" moment that the others in the series have had.

Exit: The Game - The Forgotten Island is an escape room-style game that's only meant to be played once.  The game comes with a booklet full of locations and other oddities, a bunch of object cards, some miscelleneous items that are punched out of a sheet, and an assortment of clue cards.  Like the other Exit games, this one cannot be passed onto other players once complete, as the game asks you to fold or cut up some of the booklet pages and cards.  However, upon playing it, I thought that this wasn't something a little scotch tape couldn't fix.  The game comes with an assortment of puzzles that more-or-less need to be solved in order, as solving puzzles will give you access to components that you'll need to future puzzles.  This ends up leading to some confusion when you have some but not all necessary parts of a puzzle, but the first-level clue cards tell you if you have everything.  I enjoyed the variety of puzzles here, which seemed less constrained than in the Unlock games, but on the whole I think I enjoy the overall flow of Unlock more.  This is some good fun, though.

Fesselndes Spiel mit knackigen Rätseln. Das Thema ist super umgesetzt und die Schwierigkeit ist trotz Variation sehr ansprechend. Leider ist es gerade die angesprochene Variation, die teilweise bekannte Rätsel oder deutlich zu einfache Rätsel erzeugt. Dennoch- gelungenes Team-Event.

It was interesting, but I think it kinda lacked that pulling in story. Yes, we still do puzzles, but it kinda felt differently as other Exit, which were more having this theme effect.

Puzzles in this one seemed kinda easy, until last one, we stuck there for great time and I was so frustrated after some hour or two sitting for one puzzle, that I just flipped hint cards, which I am never using.
This was first exit game, where I did flip  hint card before finishing game.

And: We finished game without spoiling any elements, so it can be given to someone if you have finished it.

This one was a little bit more frustrating of an experience. There were a lot of times where we were just sitting there scratching our heads as if we had not a clue in the world how to proceed, and once we did it was cool, but I really don't like that part of games like this. It really takes me out of the experience. Still a good game!

Glad I "played" this. It really isn't my type of "game" and as the quotation marks indicate I have a hard time identifying this as a game. I guess Exit rooms won't be for me. It's just a consequential line of riddles. Some of them very good in fact, but some of them a very tiresome and fiddly test in dexterity. No matter how good or bad the riddles are individually, all of them at once are tiresome. And boring. And they grow more tiresome and more boring the longer the puzzle lasts. While the game wants to achieve a feeling of tension it really doesn't succeed. Sentences like "Time is ticking down without mercy" are rather mildly entertaining when instead I just feel that time keeps running on and on and on and on and on and .... so forth. Will not play again and by saying that I mean the game/puzzle system! Unless at some point in the future someone I want to play with enjoys this sort of whatever it is.

Part of Season 2 of a series of one-shot escape games provide a similar kind of puzzle solving as seen with real escape rooms and are very creative in their puzzles.  There's not enough here to justify the full player count though; 2 or maybe 3 players is enough.

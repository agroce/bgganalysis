Kickstarted.

I've played this a couple of times and find I *really* like this game.  The mechanics are just solid, and the ebb and flow of power is impressive.  A game of diplomacy that still leaves a lot of room for action.  One I wish would have more occasions to hit the table.

If you're in the mood for Game of Thrones: The Board Game, and don't have the full six houses, Lyssan is an indie that you might consider, with a similar flair for intrigue and control. For a self-produced game it is fairly good, but some of the dingy artwork and colors leave something to be desired.

The first thing you notice when opening up your box of Lyssan is the high quality of all of the components. The cards and tokens feel great and the box is carefully designed to hold everything neatly. 

There is a lot of great play between the different types of units, and the number and variety of cards can make for some very exciting turns full of backstabbery fun.

I've really enjoyed playing this game.

RATING: 7
Very interesting game that centers around area control, conflict, and manipulating ones opponents.  It plays kind of like a stripped down version of the Game of Thrones board game with a touch less diplomacy (although still some) and deterministic combat that provides for more of a Chess feel.  

What really makes the game shine is the variable victory conditions and the intelligent combos you can create by chaining actions and surprising your adversary.  The changing victory conditions provide for strong replayability as one set strategy will not win you the game.  

The chaining of actions is clever as certain Agents (the game's term for units), allow you to un-exhaust another one of your units giving that Agent multiple actions.  This allows you to sometimes string together these wicked combos of your Noble un-exhausting your Priest that un-exhausts your Spy that takes its second action to steal your Courtier which you thought was safe this turn.  

The only downside I see is that the player turns can get lengthy and the game can take quite awhile to play (3 hours).  The game suggests using a timer and giving players 5 minutes maximum on their turn.  We didn't need this as we played somewhat briskly, but players prone to analysis paralysis will drag this game out.

Lyssan really didn't work for me. I actually liked the deterministic combat, the simple development engine, the area control. I HATED the goal cards. With such course scoring - the winner needs to score two goal cards - and the scoring cards coming up only one at a time, players can find themselves completely out of position to win after pursuing a particular goal card. Maybe all the goals are displayed in order at the beginning?

I've scored about 10 plays for this game now and I still enjoy it. 

It's got a bit chess-like feeling.

I like the overall artwork and the colouring of the gameboard is nice. Games play differently and there is a factor of luck in draws but you can negate it by playing tactically. Sometimes it is not enough and you will be annoyed when there just isn't any sensible way for you to compete in the available victory objectives. In those cases I either peek at the upcoming objectives (with influence cards that allow you to do so) or just blindly make a bet - there aren't that many of them afterall.

I also like very much the concept of shame in this game. Lose troops and you might lose even more because of the debt you might have to take and so on. Sometimes it is wise to game this concept and lose on purpose because you might want to take debt. All very tactical and all.

Cons:
- Some of the small cardboard tokes are too (in both colour and shape) similar to each other. It's annoying to try and differentiate them when they are on the board.
- You can lose the game on no fault of your own just due to the starting location you chose.
- The different player factions could have had a special power or starting units to differentiate them a bit.

The illustrations(paintings!) are great, and having read the rules, it sounds like a solid game. 

The typography renders the rulebook a slog [centered type, no proper section divisions, busy backgrounds behind type, etc.], and the player aids are unreadable. But I doubt either are necessary once you know the game. 

If I have the time, I'll put some alternative player aids together and publish them here.    IDEA: I wonder if the print and play rules are more readable. I never looked at them.

A Kickstarter I was impressed by the artwork and the regular updates.  I finally had a chance to play this game not that long ago and only as a 2 player game.  Both my buddy and I were rather impressed, the gameplay is simple, the strategy is deep and the game works.  I'm excited to try this with a bigger group.

AP gamers beware - an area control game with an open information rock-paper-scissors combat system - "now if I move this to there he will be able to kill me next turn but I can kill him this turn and then the next turn I can move that there and"....and gets worse with more players...Chess with randomness!

This is predominantly an abstract positioning game combined with euro/risk mechanics - you will need to manage resources which are tied to area control, as well as the rock-paper-scissors perfect information, luck-free combat system within turn order - and manipulating turn order can be devastating as getting a second turn (going last and then first) allows for some monster moves and combats given the simple r-p-s combat mechanism. The Winner is determined by achieving various "triumps" (game conditions/objectives) that are progressively revealed  each turn and can be achieved during or at the end of the next turn - luck of the draw can be very telling for these. 

The rule book is well written with some good examples however the graphic design lets the game down a lot - the art is good, even if a little dark, but the text is difficult to read (particularly on the player boards) and the colors of the troop counters are just plain awful and make a fiddly experience almost unmanageable - it is manageable but will require a lot more effort than it should.

An interesting game. Everything works well but if feels like it is one step away from being a good game that I want to play frequently. There is a bit of an issue with the triumphs, if triumphs come out that you can't accomplish you are really in a bad position that you can't do much about.

When I started playing Lyssan, I didn't come into it with the mindset of a wargamer. However, the mechanics and strategies were very accessible, and soon enough even I was scheming and plotting. I have encountered very few games in which both my defensive tendencies and my friends' more aggressive playstyles can coexist so beautifully. Every game of Lyssan that I've played has had a closely contested (and very satisfying) outcome.

The self-contained turns -- giving you the ability to quickly step away from the table for a bathroom break or a glass of water -- are a welcome bonus. You know exactly when you can and cannot play, which as a more casual gamer makes me feel significantly less stressed about thinking about the movement of incoming armies.

I really love this game and would definitely recommend it to anyone whose life needs a little more medieval action and intrigue.

EDITED TO ADD: For full disclosure, I have been an alpha tester as this game was developed. In addition, I am now a member of the Lyssan team, working on illustrations for the Print-and-Play instructions.

RATING: 10
Lyssan is the sort of strategy game that I find most rewarding. For me, it feels like a game based in simple systems that grow and build upon one another to offer rich emergent complexity and sudden surprises. I routinely find myself discovering new combinations and ways to turn the situation to my advantage.

In fact, in a dozen or so plays of this game, I think I've been able to use a different strategy almost every time. I've tried being aggressive militarily, sitting back and relying on influence, and using spies to control my enemies - and as all variations thereof, whether as a warlord that uses spies to scout for my armies or a noble that uses the clergy to keep my troops mobile and safe while building wealth at home.

What really clicked for me was the degree to which Lyssan fosters a tense and shifting set of alliances throughout the game. Turn your back on those you betrayed for a turn and they will likely be recovered and waiting for their revenge (I learned that lesson the hard way). Help an ally too much, and you'll quickly find yourself witnessing their victory. The politics are always walking a knife edge - and with pieces almost always a single move away from conflict, there isn't a lot of room for error (or trust).

That in mind, it's definitely not a game to play with people that handle such things poorly. But for me, it's this constant tension that really brings home the atmosphere of the game and makes it enjoyable.

(Edit: Got my beta kit. Woo!)

Interesante juego zonal. Bonito graficamente pero al que le pierde el diseÃ±o de los agentes de las diferentes casas. Cada ronda aparece una carta de puntuaciÃ³n (5 de 12 posibles). Cada zona aporta un recurso, existen diferentes tipos de "unidades" en el juego, cada una con su mecanismo propio. TambiÃ©n dispone de una serie de cartas que permiten modificar el juego o potenciar el motor de recursos. Bastante interactivo

Su gran pega, es difÃ­cil jugar bien las primeras partidas. Jugadores noveles no tienen nada que hacer con jugadores que conozcan el juego

Played 3 times now, and left very impressed. The first play-through was quite haphazard as we had trouble learning all of the intricacies and rules quickly (there are a lot so be prepared for a rather long first play and a lot of head scratching). But once we had made sense of how it all worked the depth of this game is amazing. We found limiting turn time to 2 minutes each made for a truly exciting and rapid-fire game as you spend the other players turns plotting your move and adapting on the fly. The only things holding this game back are the vassal courtiers in my opinion. It can be quite hard in the heady rush of your turn to quickly distinguish which are your factions and which are others, we had one player continually trying to kill his own agents by mistake! But the greatest feature is the truly beautiful design from card art to castles to the games in-box tray this is clearly a well-loved and well-thought out game. Thanks Sam

Play-tested this. The game had problems, mostly in how objectives changed suddenly and dramatically at every turn and it was impossible to plan ahead. For a game of this length that was a sin. Hopefully he took some of our advice and changed things up a bit. The designer definitely scored a great artist for his game. The artwork is beautiful. Great to see that it made it through all the hurdles and got published!

Good looking game, but the heavy penalties linked to the deterministic combat as well as the brutal 'take that' cards didn't do it for me as it is very likely some people at the table will not be having fun for most of the running time.  That may be unavoidable for the genre...

Very promising area control - mission fullfillment game. Bit like Game of Thrones or Britannia, but with more streamlined mechanics and also shorter play time. I love how the victory conditions unravel slowly and suddenly change the game for the next turn dramatically forcing people act to prevent others to fulfill missions. Forces players to confront each other which is great! Also every turn matters offering tension through the whole course of the game instead of just build up for final turn (I am looking at you GoT).

RATING: 9
This might just be my all time favorite strategy game.

Lyssan is a remarkable hybrid of a conventional territory-based wargame and a light Euro-style resources game, blended with that decadent favorite of old, Diplomacy, and then set in a world of historical, medieval treachery that hearkens to Game of Thrones. 

While at first glance the sheer number of differently patterned tokens and the rather densely laid out rulebook give the impression of an extremely complicated game, the core mechanics are surprisingly simple.  This is not a game where you'll need to play through once or twice to understand how to play - though it might take a couple of tries to understand how to win.

And the art, my [insert deity equivalent], the art looks good in this game.  Cards are beautiful, the board has a shine to it, and even the various token types are crisply printed and sturdy.

The game does involve serious scheming, though, and that can mean frayed feelings.  This is not a game for casual non-gamer friends who aren't used to games of deception and treachery.  And it's not perfect: some of the typography on the cards is difficult to read, and it's a shame that the beauty of the art doesn't get complimented by the card design/layout.  But given that the only objections I can muster are unrelated to gameplay, I suspect I'll be bringing this game to the table anytime I can find players for it.

RATING: 5
Interesting area control game that has a lot going on. My biggest issues come with the game's victory condition. A player that has accomplished little to nothing can just work on victory conditions and win without winning interactions. Penalties for losing in battle are not stiff enough, and card quality can make for imbalance. Also, the way the pieces interact with one another is very convoluted an clunky. A very cool idea, but one that falls flat.

A game of area control and conquest.  The object is the first player to obtain two victory cards.  Many details are embedded in the various characters you control while playing the game:  Nobles, Spies, Knights, and Priests.  They work off of each other based on their intricate skills.  The only off putting detail to this game is the color scheme, many of the tiles and cards you use to play with are very similar in color and make it extremely difficult to quickly scan and know who is what and where on the board.

Strong expectations from this game make my first gaming experience quite disappointing. I found the game too random and prone to AP considering its long playtime even with the use of a kitchen timer (definitely recommended 5 min round). However, the other 3 players enjoyed this game so much and one even borrowed the game from me to try and play with other players, which is quite rare for our gamegroup. Maybe it's just me?

I've been lucky enough to be involved in numerous playtests of Lyssan and have greatly enjoyed my plays of it.  The game does a number of things that I really like, starting from the very beginning, where set up puts you immediately in conflict with your neighbors from the first moments of play.  Another favorite features of mine are the hidden, randomized objectives that keep the game interesting and force you to have a dynamic strategy.  The balance between military and political units is well defined in order to provide compelling choices and allow for multiple styles of play.  I am also a fan of the influence resource and the many key effects it has on gameplay.

All in all, a great game and one I am very much looking forward to owning and playing upon its release.

RATING: 4
Lyssan is a beautifully produced labor of love with some intriguing things going on, but unfortunately it just doesn't work all that well as a game, making its three-hour length all the more onerous. 

The first problem is that controlling the Forests is clearly a dominant strategy. The Forests give players cards, which are far more useful than the other resources in the game. A third of the Triumphs are related to having Courtiers (cards) in play, which you aren't going to get by sitting in the Mountains or Farmlands. Another third of the Triumphs are for having the most of a specific kind of Agent. While resources from Mountains and Farmlands can contribute here, Influence cards are just as good: every Vassal Courtier you put into play not only gives you a free Agent but also increases the maximum number of Agents you can have of a certain type. I might be getting tons of Gold and Conscripts, but they're useless in acquiring Nobles when I max out at three (and start with two for free). To go beyond that max, I need a Vassal Courtier, and for that I need Influence cards. As for the other third of the Triumphs, which reward positional play, one of them is for controlling the most Forests, so this strategy obviously works well for that. If the Triumph for the most Mountains or Farmland pops up, big deal: shifting all your Agents to adjacent regions is not that hard.

Since this is a game of multiplayer conflict, it's not quite as easy as sitting on as many Forest locations as possible. If you happen to start out next to an aggressive player, you're both screwed, and whoever's in the Forests on the other side of the continent is pretty much guarateed victory. But let's say that other player has a different aggressor breathing down his neck, or let's say all the Forests are peacefully split evenly between all players. Then everything just comes down to the luck of the draw. Good luck winning the Triumph for the most Vassal Courtiers when you've drawn only one such card, and it has the maximum cost. Or maybe the Triumph is for the most Courtiers, Vassal or otherwise. Have fun winning that one with a hand full of Surprise cards. Sure, your Spies can steal Courtiers away, but good players are going to time it so that their Courtiers come out too late for you to do anything, or they'll just keep their Spies at home to defend against enemy Spies.

Of course, if you're going for the Forests, it's unlikely that you'll be zeroed out in any particular kind of card, but the problems don't end there. Even if you've got the cards to be in the running for one of the current Triumphs, their awarding amounts to an auction in which you have to pay up even if you lose the bid. Think your three Courtiers will win the Triumph? You play them, but then the player after you puts four Courtiers in play. There are no takebacks, and the Vassal Courtiers (for example) you just discarded to get these other three in play are gone. Of course the next Triumph will be for Vassal Courtiers or the most Spies or something the cards you discarded would have been useful for. Too late. Maybe next time you think twice about putting out "only" three Courtiers, but it turns out everyone else is playing chicken or doesn't have the right cards, and someone gets away with winning that Triumph for next to nothing. It's an awkward system. (This problem could be addressed by awarding VPs for 1st, 2nd, and 3rd on each Triumph.)

In the end, guessing which player is going to be an aggressor, hoping Triumph cards don't send conflict your way, and crossing your fingers to draw Influence cards that match the random victory conditions are not the ingredients I'm looking for in an epic three-hour game. For the kind of play that might have emerged here under a tighter system, check out The End of the Triumvirate or King of Siam, both of which play in a fraction of the time.

My rating reflects my first game which was with four players.  We got through the rules with little difficulty.  The player mats are well done and contain the information needed to play without having to refer to the rulebook. 

The game is easy learn and explain, but there are lots of moving parts to Lyssan which give it its weight. The various capabilities between the different Agents along with Influence card interactions create a learning curve that will slow down the first game.  

The map, cards, and the rest of the components look fantastic and is of high quality. However, it's hard to distinguish between some of the Vassal agents, particularly silver & black.  

Three of us liked the game and the fourth not so much; he's not a big fan of area control games and got beat up on early in the game. Overall, Lyssan is a solid, fun game and I was thinking about it long after playing it.  Unfortunatley, the game's length will prevent me from getting it on the board more often.

Wow !! I love this game !! Fantastic with 4 players. This game really delivers. I enjoy the feel of the gameplay, the quality of the components, and the style of the artwork and graphics. For me, this is an instant timeless classic. An outstanding 1st game by Sam Brown and Thornhenge.

A med-heavy area-control-ish, card hand management, medieval-times board game where the winner is the player who can time the winning of various random triumphs (missions). Much replayability with this one, despite the 3 hour gameplay.

The 2 player Master & Puppet game is awesome, but demanding because each player controls 2 factions. Therefore, though it plays in about the same time frame as a 4 player, the players are using twice the brain power. It truly is a blast, though.

I haven't played with 3 yet. 

The rulebook needs a bit of revision to keep up emphasis of some of the games' nuances. And some of the vassal conscript agents have some color problems. Still, the game is not too complicated in how to play. What IS complicated (not in a negative way) is the amount of choices to work many strategies and tactics, while remaining flexible. I learn something each time I play this, and I always feel I need to play this again soon.

RATING: 6
Not sure what to make of this. Starting with the worse:

Awful art direction. Way too much colour. There are three different colours for the type of province/area, four colours for each of the different factions, and a multitude of other colours for other factions that players may control. Colours used for factions tend to be dark and muddy, which are hard to differentiate. Perhaps differently shaped tokens would have helped? Tokens themselves are a bit too large for the board. Text on player aids very difficult to read, too.

Crazy amounts of downtime coupled together with a lot of luck. Players have to contend with a luck-less movement and combat system with four different types of units that do very different things. Add to this the crazy powerful influence cards as well as variable objectives. However, what creates the most AP in this game is that players can move [b]all[/b] (active) units per season. This is great if you are a wargamer, but torture if you are an Ameitrash gamer, which this game is targeted to.

Some very clever mechanisms:, though

Players control different types of units: knights, nobles, spies, and priests. However knights and nobles can only kill each other, and spies can only kill priests. Also, these two groups of units have different functions in the game. So it feels like you're playing two simultaneous games.

Penalties for having a unit destroyed: Losing a unit gives you shame, which requires you to sacrifice something, either an influence card (most of which are very powerful), a courtier (a permanent special power) or take a debt. Debt cards are a mixed blessing; to get rid of one, you must accomplish the task on the card, which is sometimes advantageous for you! However, this is one way to destroy an opponent. The amount of debt cards a player can accumulate is limited; if a player can't resolve all the same he or she has accumulated during one round of play, that player loses!

The two player mode of the game -- each player controls two factions -- is also interesting. Secretly, each player assigns one faction as the master and the other one as the puppet. If the puppet faction [b]loses[/b] first, the player controlling that faction [b]wins[/b]!

An interesting diplomacy/euro war game with some unique concepts, like winning by collecting most triumphs (variable conditions drawn for each game). 4 unit types, which don't stack and act separately, each with unique abilities reminiscent of paper-rock-scissors.

After a second play my rating has gone up. I think the game plays quite well with gamers that are more interested in wargames and the tactics that go along with that. I could see some groups having issues with AP players though. The game has some truly interesting mechanisms that make it feel more interesting than your standard block wargame. Off hand I think the alternating Victory Conditions add significantly to replayability.

I'm not sure what to make of Lyssan; it seemed to be an hour or two of manouvering and not doing a lot, followed by a turn or two of action that ended the game. Perhaps that was bad play from a table of newbies, but perhaps that is how the game is intended to play out. Either way, it felt pretty underwhelming.

We'll try it again to see how it improves, but I don't hold out much hope.

Also: terrible colour choices. Seriously, WTF? I think I finally understand how frustrating it must be for colourblind players.

Played with two in a learning game. Very intrigued. I could see my rating going up after trying it with more players.

  Just felt very convoluted and wasn't very fun. Bland board and too much like work. One of those games I will never play again.

I'm *extremely* pleased with Lyssan.  It hits all the buttons (in a good way) a modern Risk variant does and much more.  [Note: it most certainly does NOT feel or play like a Risk cloneâfor one thing there it's not a dice fest (indeed, there aren't any dice at all), for another, there are four unit types, each with different abilities, strengths and weaknesses.]  Rich selection of tactical and strategic options combined with a very attractive presentation.  It's a shame that it hasn't achieved the popularity it justly deserves.

All pieces there and in good condition.

RATING: 6.5
A dense, strategic-level war game with the elegance of a Euro and all the treachery of Diplomacy or Twilight Imperium. Not a friendly game, but a good one.

Medieval theme, territory control, conflict,and treachery, what's not to like?

Lots of theme in cards.  Vassal and player counters and map a bit hard to differentiate, especially if you are color blind.  Rules are relatively simple.  Combat is very simple and predictable (no dice or odds) - positioning is more important.

This is a very good game.  I am quite impressed with it.  The artwork is superb, the components are great, and the gameplay itself is exactly what I've been wanting.

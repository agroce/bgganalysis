GAME: Stalingrad Pocket II
RANK: 2268
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Part of the Gamers SCS system - only one I own and not to far from their OCS system. The Axis front disintegrates in the first few turns but I've found it very hard to close the pocket as the Soviets. As with all Gamers products lots of scenaios if you don't have the time or inclination for the whole banana.

Probably the best game of the SCS. What's not to like? Lots of panzers, Katyusha rockets, city figthing and enough steppe for cavalry!
Despite being at the heavier end (so-called OCS-lite) of the series, the rules are easy to grasp and allow you to get on and play out your Stalingrad campaign.Great components too.

Used to have SP. Kept it for a lot of years and when I finally got back into war gaming this was the first title I really wanted to get back on the table. I played it (1st and 2nd edition) and was totally underwhelmed. I couldn't figure out why, and it set me on a path to find out what I really like in war games this second time around. I discovered that I like games where the map scale matches the unit breakdowns, i.e., not stacks and stacks of counters occupying every hex in an effort to acknowledge every battalion - SP fails here for me (look at some of the pictures in the SP's gallery - the map is a mess with counters). I discovered that I like dynamic maps and re-playability, where you could explore different strategies - SP fails for me; HQ hunting seems to be the where the game ends up (that and "mash combat factors, rinse, repeat"). Mostly I discovered that I like environments that reflect situations that commanders faced,i.e., uncertainty and fog of war where command decisions are modeled, not simply the orders of battle where you have total control of all units all the time - again, SP fails for me, but at least it tried to install a little FOW via the stack examination mechanic.

This will definitely be attractive to certain tastes. If you like bread and butter hex/counter, big walls of cardboard facing in other in a slow motion sumu wrestling match of TOE's, you may like this game and lots of others like it (they seem to appeal to lots of old-timers). I was shocked to find this style was no longer my cup of tea -  other hex/counter designs offer much more in regard to tension, excitement, re-playability and the ability to illuminate history (see Liberty Roads, Totaler Krieg). Designs and mechanics have moved well beyond this title in my opinion. I would rather read a book on the Stalingrad campaign, than play a game like this.

Additionally, I used to love the maps and graphics for this series too, but they seem dated and cartoonish now. For that matter, all the maps from the Gamers seem indistinguishable from title to the next.

There is that, and then there is the annoyance of having to look up the latest series rules update. I like a game or series that is done being revised after a reasonable period, otherwise, you get the feeling that the whole thing is flawed and half-baked... not really well designed and tested to begin with. Given my experience with SCS, I am very reticent to try anything from TCS or OCS, especially with regard to the artwork and unsettled rules.

SCS has a lot of fans, so be sure to check out their comments to see if this is a game for you.

Sold.

RATING: 4
I'm nine turns into my first game (but my fourth foray into the SCS system). So far, the German units, offense, and supply seem very flexible while the Soviets are rather restricted. Especially with regard to supply. 

Supposedly, the Germans were strapped for supplies everywhere in the Don basin and a lot of what was available went to Manstein, who spearheaded the relief effort. This game gives a lot of teeth to those 'struggling' forces still in Stalingrad.

Historically, the Soviets were able to seal the Stalingrad pocket in the equivalent of three turns from the word 'go.' A German player knowledgeable in the SCS rules isn't about to let that happen. If the Russians attack on a broad front to seal the pocket, they leave themselves open to counterattacks from the pocket. If they are cautious, the pocket doesn't close and VPs are left in the hands of the Germans.

As others have mentioned, the counter density is too high for the hex grain used. Players can do themselves a favor by doing blowups of select areas of the map before play begins and transferring some of the counter load there as the situation dictates so stacks aren't mixing and falling. At least the area around Stalingrad.

13 turns in...The Germans, while not unstoppable, are absurdly powerful. 11th Pz (and other "exploit" capable units) have been running amok with Overrun/ Combat/ Exploitation since they arrived. There have been some wild swings of fortunes, but the Germans have strong reserves in this game that I'd never read about.

I'm sure I've misplayed all the Soviet advantages the game offers, but they are more than offset with the incredible flexibility in supply, movement, and combat that the Axis side holds. If 6th Army—and the German Army in Russia generally—was at the end of their tether historically, you'd never know it in this game.

Done! I wrapped up my first 16-turn game with a friend (who won a borderline minor/major victory as the Germans)  and my opinion at this point remains unchanged. I would play again, even as the Soviets, if only to give the game a second chance to change my opinion. But it would not be a casual return. I'd read the full rules, study the map, deliberate over set-up, and be a lot more careful about my directions and targets of attack. That means the game should still take at least 16 hours of solid play from start to finish as I swap experience with the system for more careful deliberation.

The game thus puts planning pressure on the Soviets. The Germans are not nearly so tied. Players may argue that, once the Russians attacked, the Germans were largely "winging it." That may be true, but it does not mean that planning for them was easy-breezy. It should mean that getting anything done was more difficult because supplies for the withdrawal and relief were so terribly short.

I can understand the Germans being tenacious _on defense._ I cannot understand why they are just as  ferocious in the attack and also so flexible with their HQs that the Rumanians, despite weak factors, are nevertheless a big help in extending the German player's ZOC-network. And the whole overrun/attack/exploitation that the Germans enjoy just makes the game rather silly in the face of one one of the largest Soviet offensives of the war.

RATING: 10
The game starts at the moment the Soviet forces are breaking through the Axis ally lines (Romanian) and try to form a pocket behind the city of Stalingrad. We are talking about the Soviet operation Uranus. Nice map and counters. The rules are straightforward, game play is thrilling keeping each player in a tense mode. The Romanians collapse in a couple of game turns living the Germans alone and shortly out of supply. They cannot abandon Stalingrad and they have to endure an attrition war with the Soviets. In the mean time the German player is preparing a relief force to penetrate the pocket and try to keep their encircled comrades in supply with airdrops. A fine balanced operational wargame.                   

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The bluntness of the SCS ZOC rules don't really allow for a full-on EATG-style pocket closing as it's too easy to throw up checkerboard defensive lines as the Germanskis.  

Worth playing and an under-represented topic.  I mean are there really another other East Front / Stalingrad games out there?  (He asked sarcastically)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Rating based on playing two of the smaller scenarios. Another very good SCS entry. Unlike some critics, I don't mind the addition of DAMs and supply points... the game is still simple to play. I have not played the original edition, so I cannot compare them. The depth here is in the strategy, not the rules. Interesting situation that can be both fluid and static at the same time, on different parts of the front. My rating is likely to increase after some face to face plays. 

UPDATE After several more playings, including some face to face scenarios, my rating is holding steady at a solid 8. Good game, but some of the small scenarios require some real finesse. Not necessarily a bad thing, but it does mean they aren't so good as introductions to the game or system. The bigger scenarios and campaign are slightly crippled by the sheer weight and number of counters, though still fairly manageable (but approaching the mini-monster category).

Simple rules but not a simple game by any means. A tough strategic situation for both players.
The historical situation is reflected in a nice way and I like to see the front lines comprised of lots of units / counters, but still being manageable because the stacks are not too big. A nice one!

Scenario 1: limits of the playing area unclear? Victory conditions could be a bit more detailed as well.Are reinforcements missing from the Vassal module?It would be nice for the Vassal module to show the units in supply (something similar to what exists in The Dark Valley module).

Enough meat to keep a wargamer busy for a few week ends. Scenario cover the different phases of the battle. My preference is going to scenario 2.

One of the better SCS games.  Does not suffer from the excessive mobility problem that most SCS games have, though three movement phases for the Axis still make for massive opportunities that lead to a Soviet "honeycomb" defense much more than to historical defense arrangements.  Also, has the problem that short scenarios are a crapshoot, while big scenarios take a looong time. Overall, I'll rather play the Uranus scenario from DG's Drive on Stalingrad than the full game of this one.  But the scenarios are decent, tense one-evening fun.

Having plowed through the rules 2 times and setting up the simple tutorial scenario, I can tell you one thing, there is a lot of game in this small package. 

- Tons of counters
- Fair bit of stacking (i don't mind so much)
- Simple rules
- Great map
- And historical scenarios 

All these things come together to make a very solid war game. Not for the feint of heart, as there can be a lot going on and even though the rules are simple, they start to add up and cause very complex situations.

I played solo, would love to see how this plays with 2, and I really want to set up one of the bigger campaigns. And this leads us to the only bad thing I can say about this game...set up is a bitch. Matching specific units to squads to battalions, etc can take 1-2 hours to get it finished. But it is worth the work.

I think I might need to look into another storage solution so can keep all the units together...the Chessex tray I have now holds everything but in big piles...

Heavy counter-density for the first couple of turns, then clears up. This costs the game at least 1 rating from my point of view. Easy game to play otherwise & to teach as well.

Does well at what it is supposed to do, namely show the hopeless situation of the 6th army at Stalingrad once the counterattack took place and the pocket closed.

This is my first game in the SCS Series. I agree with the comment: « You spend time on the strategy, not in trying to assimilate a rulebook. »

I had a lot of fun playing this game: It was tense up to the last turn. Very good!

Like someone said: The Soviet player have to plan carefully each move, attack and reserve to be successful here: Not quite the « shooting from the hip » announced in the Designer’s notes…

A few more comments:

1. I still don’t know how to break through the German defenses on the right flank, especially when the 24th PZ Division reinforces the 29th Mot Division there…

2. Larger hexes would have been appreciated: It’s very crowded in and around Stalingrad!

Ditto for numbered hexes! I played with the historical setup and it’s really annoying and time consuming to setup when the numbered hexes already contain units and you have to count again and again to find where to setup your units!

[I could pay $15-$20 more to have those two, even if it means 2 maps! I have enough room.]

3. I would like special rules for Stalingrad: Something to simulate the historical situation of the 51st Corps and 62nd Army.

4. Some players complain about « HQ hunting ». In all my games, the German player managed to destroy one Soviet HQ, stacked with an Infantry unit. But the arrival of the 2nd Guard Army solved the problem in one case and the local German « victory » [the 11th PZ, 6th PZ and 2 Infantry Divisions reducing the 5th Tank Army] was balanced by the collapse of the 11th and 8th Corps, leading to a near encirclement of Stalingrad in the other case. So, this HQ « problem » is just a minor nuisance to me. I confess the Soviet player must be careful, though: Those PZ Divisions are nasty beasts!

Not sure how historical it really is. It is difficult to pocket a competent German player who keeps a fire brigade in reserve to successively blunt each Soviet thrusts, but this is one epic battle. German arty in reserve mode is deadly. My only gripe with the system is the CRT, it can go from NR to A2 or A1 to D2R2. A bit too much variance for me, it is often all or nothing. Counter density is high; so you definitely need tweezers for this one.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
I'd rate this a 5, if the campaign could play it a bit quicker (not a fan of the smaller scenarios).

Brings out the best and worst of SCS.

Best - simple rules keeps the flow of the game moving along and there is a lot of game to play without the complexity.

Worst - HQ hunting is BS.  And exploit capable units are just too mobile.  And the ability of the Germans to pull units out of Stalingrad so quickly...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Nearly a perfect game.  

I do think the game forces too much advanced planning on the Soviets.  To play them well you really need to study and sequence your moves and reserves, down to the last unit.  You build a contraption and then watch it unfurl.  That should make this game a 10, but I think for an SCS game the brain-strain on the Soviet player is a bit too much.  But overall as a Stalingrad game this is a complete winner...everyone should try it.  Its that good.

This is one of the best Standard Combat Series games I have played.  Ran the game right to the end and scored a minor Soviet victory.  It was tough to do, but do able.  

The rule set is simple but one still has to utilize lots of long range planning and strategy.  I really like this system.  

The only thing I didn't like was how the Germans get 2 Artillery barrages per turn and the Soviet's only one.  That made it very hard for the Soviets to make head way.  But maybe it also slowed them down quite a bit.

I really didn't do much with Stalingrad itself as the modifier was a defense 4 which just means who ever attacks cannot get good enough odds to do anything about it.  Most of my combat was on the flanks trying to close the pincer.  

If one wanted to go further than the 16 turns, then it would probably be just like the real battle.  The Soviets would have closed the pincer and then slowly wipe out the Germans in Stalingrad.  But for me it would have taken more than the 16 turns allotted.  

In hindsight I would have go after the artillery of the Germans more to stop that advantage.  

All in all, played it solo and it was great.  Great fun for days, just like I like them.

RATING: 4
A failed attempt at simplifying a game, because rules are simple (sometimes simplistic) but oob is over-detailed and counters just too numerous to allow for a fluid game.

In the end, game experience is of the most disappointing. Mostly a game of "push troops to get a 3-hex-to-1 attack without additional thinking", with a lot of bean counting to add combat values of 4-counters stacks.

(Later) comments from the 2-rater give an excellent synthesis of what the game experience feels like: "bread and butter hex/counter, big walls of cardboard facing in other in a slow motion sumu wrestling match of TOE's". It does feel like playing a game designed in the 1970's

Fairly clean system compared to other wargames on the subject matter. High counter density makes this a bigger and more intense game than rules suggest.

Obgleich bereits vor längerer Zeit als Teil der sogenannten „Standard Combat Series“ erschienen (1996), ist das Spiel (für mich) eine kleine Wargame-Entdeckung: sehr einfache Regeln: Es gibt einen acht Seiten langen Regelgrundstock, der sich auf alle Games dieser großteilig noch erhältlichen Reihe bezieht; hinzu treten 4-6 Seiten Regeln für das spezifische Einzelspiel. Eher simple Kämpfe mit nur 2-4 DRM, drei kleinere Szenarien (die de facto Lernszenarien sind: man lernt in erster Linie die recht komplexe Geographie im weiteren Umfeld Stalingrads kennen), eine große Kampagne + ein What if-Szenario – und das alles ohne „hidden information“, will sagen: bestens für das Solo-Spiel geeignet.

There are many differences between the 1st and 2nd edition games and additional special rules (DAM's, more brittle Rumanians, etc.) The second edition also corrected many problems with the maps in the first edition game.

My first exposure to SCS.  An excellent game. Fun without the fiddliness of OCS supply rules.  SC is as classic a hex and counter game system in the "modern" era as you can get.

yay! this hits the sweet spot of lite rules, meaningful decisions, and fun, fast play. all while implementing the major elements of wargaming. while i'm not so keen on the counter art (hey, it works), the map art and design is pretty awesome. it feels like a well-researched simulation that's abstracted just right for playability.

another nice thing is the relatively low counter density and few status markers (and little need for them). the stacks, however, can get a little high and tricky to handle. 

i also really wish this series would put their charts on a separate sheet of paper (instead of or in addition to the map). i play this solitaire and in a tight space. it'd be nice if all the charts were in a single, handy place.
 
my only nits.

will be picking up more titles in this series fer sure.

I dream of having time to play Europa, OCS, and other large games. Until I have the time and space there is SCS. I love the system. I think the scale in this game is perfect. Lots of fun but more realistic than a lot of other fun games. I think SCS really achieved its design goals, especially with this one.

Set-up time a little cumbersome but the game played ahistorical (or close to it)as pocket was formed and the race to save the 6th army was on.

I prefer first edition, but this one is nice too, very balanced and very fluid situation. German player have to defend Don bridges to have a chance of win.
However is difficult to play with russian too. Good game

The first edition is much more interesting, as this one is too heavy and slow for an SCS, and not deep enough to justify the added lenght and complexity. It also degenerates into HQ hunting.

Played the Chir River Scenario ftf, quite tense but the 11 PZ does not act as an aggresive hand that smacks the Soviets, more of a last line of desperate defence. Still played quickly as seemed balanced :)

Rough setup (takes forever), insane counter stacks and density, stacking values awfully hard to read. Always beware a single map game with +/- 600 counters. Still, a very clean set of rules, good play value and historical feel, if a bit of chore at times.

The Gamer's SCS series.  Battalion and regiment scale for the Germans, divisions for the Russian hordes.  Very hard for the Germans to hold the line and prevent Stalingrad from being encircled.  No surprise there.  I look forward to trying again...I have a notion to pull back the elite 29th Motorized, and augmented with panzers stripped from Stalingrad, trying to hold the right flank.  Doesn't solve the problem of lousy Romanian units on the left, but what the heck.

The system is simply outstanding.  The game rules are relatively simple and plays smooth.  The map, counters, and charts are well laid out and quite attractive.  The game is surprisingly balanced, fun, and action packed.

Part of OCS Gamers series. Only one large map but large # of counters. Operational size game that covers the actual Stalingrad Pocket itself and the relief attempts in the immediate area. Recommend as playable with an excellent Vassal module.

Played the relief scenario and enjoyed it. Will try a larger scenario later and will update comments.

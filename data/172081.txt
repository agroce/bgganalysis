RATING: 8.2
I've played this enough to know that it's a great co-op game. There hasn't been a time when playing this game that we all weren't scheming and involved. Most Co-Ops have a lot of downtime, and while there may be table talk, other players actions may not necessarily be too important. This game has all players involved. It's as tense as Pandemic, with a heist theme that makes it highly approachable.

RATING: 6
Snazzy coop, and an excellent usage of artwork to enhance the feel of the game. This feels less mathematical than Pandemic et al in that the rooms (at least in the full 3 floor game) are less logical in it's procedural involvement and more adventure for the first half of the game (while exploring rooms). In that regard, it is sort of an adventure; sometimes you play and the room locations work out great, and other times you're on the first floor and run into 3 consecutive deadbolts and never escape the guard. To say that it's not logical though is a fallacy; there is usually an optimum move and with a lopsided group, the QB problem still exists (compared to say, Eldritch Horror where it's reduced further IMHO).

The end game I think is where it becomes a normal coop that folks are accustomed to; the rooms are revealed, you're just trying to get onto the roof. There is something that is both satisfying and grating about having the game be rooms which are revealed and the guard's movement be somewhat known. I don't have any idea how to improve it in terms of late game.

At taking close to 2 hours to play a full game (and win), it sort of overstays it's welcome. To that end, it's a game that I find I enjoy playing, but unlike Eldritch Horror where I get excited to play it once in a while, this I could play more often, but I'm not particularly passionate about it. It's neat, cute, and enjoyable (all generally helpful characteristics in games), but it's sort of drab or lackluster in it's awesomeness. Very much worth trying, and Fowers should be proud of it.

RATING: 9
A lot of fun, very engaging, fantastic artwork and a captivating theme, the tension is palpable as the situation escalates. The first cooperative game in my collection, and I don't feel a need to rush out and buy another coop game any time soon. I'd consider giving this a 9 (my initial score: 8.5) but I'll wait and see how I feel after a few more solo and group plays. The packaging is also worth mentioning, very compact and stylish.

2017-04-07: Having played this 12 times in the last 3 months (with 2 players and 4 players) we've had a blast every time. After the first few plays, we realised we'd misinterpreted one or two rules and had made it easier to win. Subsequent plays have been more challenging, particularly with 4 players, which only sharpens our enthusiasm.

(09/1017) This is my favorite of Tim Fowers' games. The setting for the game is just outstanding. Every mechanic makes sense, and the A.I. movement is brilliant. This co-op, more than any other I've played, has lead to long lasting jokes, stories, and memories among my friends.

The game is great fun! Now with the tower providing a three-dimensional office building, it's an even better experience. It's not easy or quick, but it's great fun. Shut Up and Sit Down really describes it well in their "BurgleBrawl" podcast.

I adore the theme. The graphic design on the tiles is too faded and abstract for me. The meeple stickers take away in this case. I'd rather have had standies here. The other problem for me is the setup time - very lengthy for the light theme, taking up *alot* of table space which makes it difficult as well. But there are several small decisions in the design that are very smart - like the unlock mechanic for safes. And the way the guards move about in a programmatic style that I like to puzzle against. But having said all that, I don't think I will be playing it often enough.

*Rating based on one play.

This is a puzzle-y cooperative game.  The theme is fairly unique and the multi-level board is somewhat interesting, but the gameplay is too shallow for the play time.  The 45-minute intro scenario on two levels felt too long to me, so I can't imagine playing the full 90 minute, 3-level game.  There's just not enough complexity to the game to keep it interesting for that long of a play time.  We ran into several times where the best move for one (or more) of the players was to simply stand still in their current location.  The variety of actions available is quite restricted, and the vast majority of the time, the players are going to be moving around or peeking at adjacent tiles, and that's just not that interesting of a game to me.

Additionally, the game lacked a sense of tension that the best cooperative games have.  The programmed movement of the guards is perhaps too predictable for you to feel like you are taking risks.  While it's true that when a guard reaches its destination, it will get a new, random destination, that didn't happen frequently enough (and the probability that the new destination would lead the guard past you wasn't high enough) to feel like it was a major threat, at least early in the game.  I will note that we missed one rule that causes the guards to move a bit faster once the first safe was opened, which served to reduce the tension, but we corrected for this with the second safe.

In the end, I don't think this is a bad game, just not one that holds my interest.

RATING: 6
Goes on a bit too long for what it is but it's a fun co-op with a nice theme. The rulebook however is pretty atrocious and we often found ourselves rulings things as we thought they might be intended or thematically. I don't understand how a playtested game could end up with such a rulebook...

Seems overly hard and thinky.  The NPC movement was cool and made me think a little of [b]Hitman Go[/b]: their path is known, but it takes planning to make it work for you.

Co-operative game in which you are a team of burglars trying to find the safes, crack them and escape from the building without getting caught by the guards. The thematic integration is done very well and it has a playful sense of humor. Quick turns make the game fly by. 

Cons: optimal strategy may require some players to be sidelined from the action sometimes.

RATING: 10
You get to play as a useful character in a cooperative game. However, only one person can carry the loot! I never knew thieves were so diverse in skills.
Pro: Cooperative with grid movement and a modular set-up 
Con: You never know if the set-up is exceedingly easy or downright difficult. Doesn't come with a heist-themed soundtrack.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Neat concept, nice components, and fairly good execution. This one is one of those puzzles-as-games, where everybody tries to solve the current challenge.

The keys to enjoying the game are to not care about the random layout of the building (the tiles are randomly sorted into three fifteen-tile stacks, then you add the staircases, and shuffle each stack before placing the tiles in a four by four grid to create the building levels), and accept that you come across the tools randomly, even though you are highly skilled thieves.

But if you can ignore those little details, the game can provide for some fun and enjoyment.

Fun little game. I adore heist themes, so this was an instant purchase for that reason alone.

This is a great cooperative game. You're a crack team of burglars (think 'Ocean's Eleven') sacking the saves in a highly secure multi-story building. Each team member has a special ability, but beware of the security guard who patrols each floor. I'm not a huge fan of this game in solo mode - it really shines with three and four players. Very cool.

A coop game that is more explicit in its puzzle nature than many of its ilk.  We are negotiating a labyrinth, trying to find particular tiles (safes to rob).  The task is made more complicated by a guard who patrols a randomised route around the labyrinth and responds to alarms tripped by the player characters. Each of those characters has a special power to aid the party.  The heist theme is actually quite nicely implemented, aided by delightful artwork that pastiches sixties cartoons. Yet for me this game remains a puzzle and I don't find puzzles terrifically engaging.

Production quality is excellent.

cooperative game. Players are unique members of a crew trying to pull off a robbery of a highly secure building — without getting caught.

-We had an easy time with 2p and 2 levels only so cannot comment on hardness. I can imagine it is harder with more players and 3 levels.
-For a coop it looked like good but alpha players must have a hard time not telling the others how to move. ;)

Egy épület (irodaház) 3 emelete van egymás mellé téve az asztalon, bennük helyiségekkel, emeletek közt lépcsőn lehet mozogni. Van minden szinten egy őr, aki folyamatosan mozog és nem jó ha meglát. Tele van az épület riasztókkal, ezek a legkülönfélébb módon aktiválódnak. Mindenféle egyéb tárgyak és loot-ok színesítik a játékot. A célunk, hogy feltörjünk minden emeleten egy széfet, majd elmeneküljünk a tetőn át. Nagyon egyedi, nagyon jól néz ki, és tök jól is működik. De rohadt nehéz:) Igaz első két alkalommal hibásan is játszottuk, mert csak 3 élettel számoltunk, holott 4 van. De mindenképp nehéz, akár pár perc alatt vége lehet. Nagyon sok taktikai lehetőség van, amikor már úgy tűnik vége, lehet hogy még fél óráig húzzuk, de végül csak elkapnak a rohadékok:)) Igényes, és dicséretesen kicsi a doboz. A karakterek kezdő oldalát használtuk csak.

It's only OK. I prefer Pandemic as far as similar games go. 

The gameplay is simple and the setup provides replayability. A single game takes longer than we expected (6+ plays now). At times, I do like this game more than Forbidden Desert due to it being a more dynamic experience and providing a more light-hearted theme. However, that dynamism can result in a lack of consistency.  Put into a slightly different way, Burgle Bros has moments that shine brighter than Forbidden Desert, but an individual session is more likely to fall flat than the well-tuned machine that is Forbidden Desert. The rule book could be organized better or could be improved by changing the format from its small booklet.

Edit: April/May 2017: I see myself pulling Pandemic or Forbidden Desert out over this 4 out of 5 times if I want a lighter coop. In the end, this game just plays way too long for what it is. The theme is the only thing that would cause me to pull this out over other games.

Edit, June 2017: In the end, having an attractive theme isn't enough to save this game for me. It plays too long and inconsistent. The game play of this game pales in comparison to other similar games, like Pandemic Iberia and Forbidden Desert. I gave this game to a family member who seemed interested in it.

Burgle Bros. is a super fun cooperative heist game. You sneak around stealthily in a three story tall building avoiding guards and cracking safes, and it feels like you're in a classic heist movie. When playing, we put on the soundtrack to Lupin III and have a real good time! To really get in the mood I bought some red blinking LED "party dots" to use instead of the cardboard alarm tokens that come with the game. I recommend this game a lot! 

Unfortunately, the shipping practices of the producer are terrible, so if you can procure a copy second hand, it'll save you a lot of trouble and hair (that would otherwise have been torn out in frustration). I received my copy almost two months after I placed my order, without getting any notice about the delay beforehand. When it finally arrived, the box was badly scratched and damaged (I did not take this into account when rating the game, the game itself is amazing).

Thematic. That's the word I'll start with. The artwork, the setting, the gameplay, it all fits together in the theme.

The setup time though is something to consider, and the guard patrols system, whilst neat, does sometimes lead to odd movements or situations that makes planning a total gamble. The real downside though is that everything is open, which makes quarterbacking an issue to watch out for. 

I recommend playing the introductory 2 floor setup (The Office Job) first.

It's a fun thing to play, but there's something not quite satisfying about it. Like it needs something a little bit more for a wow factor.

Maybe if the designer knew how to design a game, rather than just making it look good and be gimmicky, this game would stand a chance. But since more effort was put into art and a 3-tiered gimmick (which is a monstrosity, by the way), there's really no game here. What a waste of $60 for me.

(KIDS) I'm a big fan of fully cooperative games that are well put-together and Burgle Bros. fits that description. It's very similar in that way to Pandemic and Flash Point. This game does a great job of setting up players to work together and simulating a team heist. The tools and loot and events and rooms all create an environment that leads to a good experience. Many of them are cleverly designed to tie in the theme.

I'm also impressed with the designer's ability to design, develop and publish a nice game with quality components.

This co-op lets you and your friends become master thieves and enact your own ocean's 11 style heist. The system for moving the guards around works well and is surprisingly thematic. Watching to see their destinations and avoiding their paths, while learning what each room contains and cracking into each safe is both fun and intense. Only succeeded once so far, but this game is fun regardless of the result.

This is one of the most cinematic boardgames out there. The characters, the rooms, the events - everything combines together to form a tight, tense game. The difficulty is there but it's the enjoyable kind, not the "I kick you in the nuts while you're down" type. It probably helped that the art is so damn charming too. 

I highly recommend this game, if not just for the challenge to try and stop yourself from playing the mission impossible theme in your head while making your moves.

Explore three levels of a building looking for 3 safes.  Crack the safes and get out without being caught by the guards.  Random tile layout for the building.  Cooperative with thieves with special powers.

What a great co-op. Production is nice and the gameplay is pretty sleek and simple. The theme is well applied and doesn't feel tacked on at all. It's also very tense, as you try to maneuver around the guards! Would highly recommend!

RATING: 7
Interesting cooperative game.  Like it best solitaire.  The biggest issue that I have with the game is that if a tile (like deadbolt) is placed in a difficult spot the game can be excruciatingly difficult.  I don't need it that difficult.  I do like that it takes a lot of thinking and one can affect what happens.

A readily enjoyable co-op puzzle/push-your-luck game. There's a fair few things to like, including the art style, the nice change in gameplay depending on which characters you have and (it bears mention because of how well it is done) the box and the packing.

That being said, what drags it down sometimes is how much space it needs on the table. For such a teensy box, it needs a *lot* of space. Not something to bring along for traveling.

Really really cool game. High quality components, good artwork, nice box...
...but why doesn't the manual fit the box so it can close properly? Either the box doesn't close or you have to bend the rulebook.
But that's it. There is nothing else what is negative in this game.

It is really fast playing (if it really lasts 90 minutes then it feels more like 30-45), keeps the whole group engaged and is just fun.

RATING: 3
Absolutely classic Kickstarter: all the money was spent on art and physical design, and (apparently) very little effort was put into development, testing, and generally making it an interesting game. Clearly inspired by Forbidden Desert, this lacks any of the attributes that made that game good.

Now, Burgle Bros. does work; you can basically get through a game without too much struggle. But:

- It's grotesquely overlong and repetitive. It's about 45 minutes of game that pushes a rather shocking two hours to play
- It lacks any narrative drive, escalating stakes, or tension. As you accumulate stuff and need to haul it out of the building, your options become more restricted and the game tension and interest fails.
- Because movement options are frequently so restricted by walls and guards, your often face situations where you can do nothing productive and team will be far better off if you sit on your hands, or do donuts in a corner, than if you try to take an action. This is stupid.
- The random allocation of rooms can lead to distributions which are silly and tension levels that totally die at various points in the game; this really needed some sort of "seeding" to ensure a minimally rational distribution of terminals, alarms, etc., throughout the different floors.
- A lot of game effects of various cards are pretty dumb. The loot that seriously constrains your actions, or randomly kill a stealth token, are just bad design. Player powers seem quite uneven.
- there are a bunch of different alarm types which are only marginally distinct and just clutter the design space. The deadbolt, keypad, and overpass which just randomly severely hose you are not interesting, they're just annoying.

Basically, I get the idea that the designer liked Forbidden Desert, so he just grabbed the mechanisms, tweaked them a bit, and put his own chrome on top of them, and then only played the game with his buddies who couldn't give him negative feedback. This is not the route to successful game design. Bugle Bros. is a functioning game, which is something, but it committed the cardinal gaming sin: it bored me. And it's way too long. Halve the playtime, and I think you have a workmanlike design.

RATING: 6
A pretty neat cooperative game with a good theme. It's fun trying to figure out how to lure the guards away from your fellow burglers, using all the various room and item effects.

The only minor frustration was that the rules aren't very clean, and we ended up making a few judgement calls on how we thought things were supposed to work. But, this is somewhat minor and seasoned gamers can hash it out.

Overall, fun stuff if you're looking for a co-op with a fresh theme!

RATING: 7
A nice coop, but I feel it's too random in the room placement.  I almost want to DM the building floors, to make the layouts logical: ensure the balconies are only on upper floors etc.

Hard as nails with 4 players; we even tried a five player game, which ended very badly for the heist crew...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Based on 1 play with 4 players:

There's just too many co-op games I'd reach for before this. The theme is ADORABLE and at its best, you are making some clever plays to distract the guards so your friends can make their way through safely...

but the puzzle itself is pretty straightforward, and the game overall is just missing some key tension. No matter how well things are going for you in Pandemic, there is always this slow build up of problems you have to deal with - there is always the feeling that there are things you [i]have[/i] to stay ontop of, or all the bad things will pile up and cascade into something catastrophic. There's none of that here. The time pressure is barely felt, and there isn't really much opportunity for the game to explode. The result is a game that should feel dangerous, but instead feels inert.

It doesn't help that we skipped straight to Normal difficulty on our first play and won fairly handily. The harder scenario doesn't seem super interesting, but I'm willing to try it. It's not that I didn't enjoy the game, simply that I spent the whole game being painfully aware that it could be much, MUCH better.

Backed at the very last minute - and glad I just made it in time. The addition of the Loot Deck (and addition of slight competition) won me over. The gameplay mechanics seem to capture the spirit of conducting heists very nicely, forcing one to explore and use both layout and tools to facilitate the process. Everything matches the theme wonderfully  and the variety in characters (doubled, since the KS project) provides so much range in formulating interesting strategies. Replaces Forbidden Desert (for me).

This is a great game for coaxing a friend or loved one into gaming, especially if that friend or loved one dislikes conflict between players. Here, you're working as a team to solve a puzzle - specifically to rob several safes without being caught by the guards. Succeeding means working together, and that means communication. "Burgle Bros.," therefore, is a highly social experience where teammates will be constantly talking in order to decide how best to proceed. Just make sure to avoid "Alpha Player Syndrome," where one bossy actor takes over the proceedings!

For me, there are two broad types of co-ops: puzzle (e.g. Pandemic) and experience (e.g. Arkham Horror). Burgle Bros definitely falls into the first category. Variable setup and player powers keep the puzzle fresh and ensure high replayability, but the game can be prone to alpha-player-syndrome. Production is very good while maintaining a small shelf-footprint. Small Warning: I've had players be upset with the need to spread the team out and the jockeying between the three floors in order to manipulate guard movement. This may cause one or more players to be stuck with "disctraction-duty" while others do all the fun-stuff: exploration and safe-cracking. Switching characters between players has helped to alleviate this problem.

This is a cooperative game where we are all working our way through a building avoiding guards and protected rooms(laser, mvt, etc) and trying to break into the safes.  There's three levels with faster guards on each level.  We can each hide from the guard three times before getting caught.  Very clever design, and a pretty good cooperative game with some dice rolling as well.

I am not sure why the box was very underwhelming for me.  I like the art on the box.  I think I was worried that such a small box would have enough content.  I almost thought of listing it on ebay but cracked open the wrap and liked what I saw.

The game play was more thematic and tense than I expected.  It seemed to move pretty quick and players can help each other out at times.  Pretty excited to play again.

update (2017) - I like it better with 2 players as the puzzle is shared with less people.  Luck can kill you and that feels frustrating.

Burgle Bros is a big game in a little box.  The theme of breaking into a high security building and getting out with the loot comes through really well.  It has tons of replayability.  Players have unique abilities like in Pandemic - there's even one role that's similar to the dispatcher.  Downsides are that the set up is a little fiddly and you'll need a good sized table

Ha, this is fun! Played the 2 level 'office building' mission as a practice late on Christmas day to get the mechanics down. We found both safes, but the guards are tough to get by! Bad luck on a few occasions shortened the game, but we enjoyed it enough to keep it and will try it again sometime over the next few days.  Gameplay mechanics are solid and fun, but remember your special abilities! 

2nd play - awesome, played the office again, we won! We were really unlucky the first game, and pretty lucky this one, overall this is a fun game that plays pretty quick. We did NOT remove 6 cards (2 player) from the patrol deck once it was used though, wouldn't have mattered either way.

Burgle Bros. is a cooperative game for 1-­4 players. Players are unique members of a crew trying to pull off a robbery of a highly secure building — without getting caught. The building has three floors (4x4 tiles), each with its own safe to crack. Players start on the first floor and have to escape to their helicopter waiting on the roof.

Players each have three stealth tokens. Whenever they are on the same tile with a guard, they lose one. If any player is caught without a stealth token, the game is over. If players can open all three safes, and escape through the stairs to the roof they win.

This game is ridiculously smart, and the theme is perfect. You feel steeped in a sort of 60's heist movie, complete with the palpable sensation of running out of time... and cat and mouse stealth. It's a beautiful little set, complicated enough to sink your teeth into without losing anybody at the table, and a great draw for new players. About the only problem I have with it is that the setup is a bit long for how quickly your plan can fall apart.

Cooperative, intense and so far truly hard game of bank heist. Every player has a special power and combining those with luck and good planning you have to find and unlock safes on every floor and run through the roof before guards catches any of you. It's fun but a bit more luck dependent.

Rising High add on makes a game much appealing and makes you stand up near the end of the game when you get close to the roof.

Burgle Bros is a cooperative boardgame where you assemble a crew, make a plan, and pull off the impossible heist! Gameplay is for 1 – 4 players and typically lasts for 45 – 90 minutes. To play, you must make your way past the alarms and guards, find the stash and get to the roof to escape. But be careful – if anyone on your crew gets caught, it’s all over.

This game is so fun and intense once the guards really start moving around. Takes about 15 minutes to setup and explain rules.

OK, after two plays I feel a lot better about the game than after my first play. Our first game was the standard Bank Job and it was way too easy for us. Maybe we just got really lucky. The second game was the Fort Knox scenario (shout out for the website that will create the floor layouts for you!), and it was a lot more interesting. We won but at least one of us got down to one stealth token so there was some tension. I might play with only 2 stealth tokens per player though until we start losing.

This is such a good logic puzzle type of game for two players. We're trying to figure out how to best avoid the guards and make trade offs with stealth tokens or player powers and it's a lot of fun. It's HARD too and we've never won with the default three-floor scenario. My only complaint is that it's a lot of setup and we've had some games that end really quickly for a really unlucky streak of actions.

A very nice coop game. Like all good coops it is a puzzle in which you do not have all the information and sometimes have to take a gamble. Love the art and theme of the game. Everything works well and the game flows smooth.

Great co-op game. Fairly easy to set up and explain. Sometimes the randomness of the building layouts wont make sense, or just make it too hard or easy. Similarly with the negative effects of the loot, some are too hard to deal with in certain layouts.

Nagyon jó a sztori, nagyon jó a téma/tematika és a hangulat is. A szabályok is jónak tűnnek, végre kiderült, hogy nem csak pandemic klónokat lehet koop társasként kiadni. Viszont sajnos a balansz valahogy nem jött össze. Az nem lenne baj, hogy nagyon nehéz a játék, de az igen, hogy rengeteg múlik a szerencsén. Négyen pláne extrém sok. Ha nem találunk azonnal lépcsőt akkor egyszerűen bármit teszünk ránk gyalogol az őr, mire újra sorra kerülnénk. Persze kell a véletlen a koop játékokba, de ebbe szerintem több került, mint amennyi még tolerálható lenne. Lehetséges, hogy ez a faktor kevesebben kisebb. Érdemes lenne hármasban kipróbálni.

Kettesben szerencsére egy totál másik játékot sikerült megismerni. Végre működik, értelmes minden. Nagyon nem ajánlott négyes. Valszeg hármasban még  lehet.

Egy hármas parti után teljesen beleszerettem. Lehet, hogy újra meg kéne próbálni négyesben is, mert azért volt, amit benéztük az első két játéknál. Mondjuk az biztos, hogy úgy sokkal nehezebb. A legutóbbi party valami fenomenális élmény volt, Meg kellett volna filmesíteni

---------
Sikerült újra négyesben is játszani. Jó szabályokkal már így is volt esélyünk, sőt, szinte simának tűnt a győzelem, amit azért csak bebuktunk a végén. Így összességében szuperjó játéknak tartom, akár 10-es is lehetne leginkább a nagyszerű hangulata miatt. Egyedül a nem túl pontos szabály és a játékosszámra nem teljesen kiegyensúlyozott játékmenet vesz le ebből.

Relatively mediocre/ordinary game:
Has a few simple randomisation things (map/tiles) with one fun mechanic (patrol path of the people catching you).
Your best turn is usually relatively obvious. It is a little tense which is nice. Good for players who want an easy, tense game (I never want easy games!)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Mechanically fairly standard puzzly cooperative game with a nicer theme than most. The way the guards move allows the players quite a bit of control - possibly too much since it can be exploited easily and really detract from the thematic integration: the guards become much less of a constant threat and more of an obstacle that needs to be moved out of the way.

Tim Fowers did it again. He took co operative genre and added a twist.

I will admit that I am not the biggest gamer. I usually play lighter casual games that take 30-45 minutes a game. That being said, I was really attracted by the theme and components of Burgle Bros so I purchased the game.

On my first attempt, I decided to play the office heist (45 minutes); the experience was somewhat negative. For first, the rules are overly complicated and hard to follow. Many times, you have to guess what the designer had in mind. Also, to play the office heist, I actually had to go back and read the rules for the bank job to really understand how to set up the game.

Although the game was enjoyable, I felt it ran long (even though we barely made it to the 2nd floor before losing the game) and that the moves were very repetitive. Seemed like the game had more to do with luck rather than strategy. As many stated, many times, either me or the other player were better off staying put rather than doing any of of our 4 allowed actions (my character actually had 5 a turn and often couldn't produce one).

I suppose I will play the game again here and there but I'll really need to be in the right setting to do so. Too bad because the graphics of the game were so great it made me purchase the game, but they are not enough to make me want to replay it. At least, not at this point...

This is an excellent game. I got the tower for this one so that really adds to the theme. This is a lot of fun but takes a little bit to set it up. Your cooperative goal is to crack the safe on each floor and make it to the chopper on the roof (and with all the loot) before the guards get you. The guards roam the floors and the pressure begins to build as decks of cards run out - and guards speed up. You have to snake your way around them, hiding, snooping, and using your abilities. Every character has 2 abilities to choose from.

Greatest heist/caper game. It evokes the theme so well, gripping players' every move, providing great fun in an easy to learn game. It's got decent replayability & is not too repetitive since the tiles are shuffled, guards always have a different path, and the many other additional variations. Pretty unique in the heist theme- not too many others like it.

One play so far with 3 players. It's overall good, and I want to explore the other characters and tools. I commend Tim and the development team on the production work and on a Kickstarter campaign successfully run.

But IMHO, it felt like the game was one mechanic short of ideal. I wanted a reason to visit rooms other than just to search for stairs/safes, and the fact that rooms were mostly only obstacles kept the action focused but also felt a little too one-dimensional. I was hoping for more strategy in using the terrain to my advantage. To be fair, it looks like more of that will come with the Tools and Events.

The major strategic lever appears to be control of the guard, either by setting off alarms or by moving from a floor to prevent the guard moving as quickly. In the game we played, the inability to easily set off alarms meant we didn't have much control, and thus fewer choices to make.

It feels like the movement of the guards is pretty fast even at 3, and it doesn't generally seem feasible to keep more than 2 players on a floor for any amount of time at that level, much less at 4+. Will see how subsequent games play out, but some variations on the building layout with other scenarios will be welcome.

The last nit was the wording on the cards and tiles--they needed to be more precise to avoid confusion. For example, the "Reboot" card that said to "set hack tokens on any computer room to 1" was ambiguous: should it result in hack tokens being added to rooms without them, or just reduce tokens to 1 on "any rooms" that already had them? (We had a difference of opinion in the group, but given the name of the card, we assumed that it should only affect rooms with existing hack tokens.) These rough edges should have been identified and addressed during playtesting.

Despite these minor issues, overall it's a good game in which I hope to discover more depth after further play. Our first play was a solid 7, but I gave a 7.5 for benefit of the doubt and for the excellent presentation and obvious care that went into the production. I expect this score will either go up to 8 or down to 7 with further plays, but not beyond either of those.

Un de mes coups de coeur. On joue une bande de voleurs qui font un casse dans un immeuble. Ce dernier est représenté par trois carrés de 5x5 tuiles. Chaque tuile représente une pièce. Chaque étage contient un coffre et un escalier. Un garde patrouille chaque étage et les pièces sont bien souvent protégées par des alarmes, qui les attirent. Les personnages vont coopérer pour réussir leur casse. La mécanique est rodée, simple et très bien vue. Le matos, superbe.

Bredpit vagy Dzsordzsklúní?
Akaratlanul is az ”Ocean’s Eleven” című film ugrott be a játék megismerése során. Menő csirkefogóink egy épület több szintjén keresik a széfeket és vinnék a szajrét a tetőn át menekülve.
A játék kooperatív, a jobb fajtából. Az előkészítése során lefordított szobalapkákból és falakból felépíted a terepet több szinten. Ami állandó, hogy minden emeleten meg kell találnod a „mackót” és a következő emeletre vagy a tetőre vezető lépcsőt. A többi meglepetés.
Minden karakter speciális képességgel rendelkezik, amire szükség is lesz, hiszen őrzik az épületet és az idő elteltével a helyi biztonsági erők egyre nagyobb tempóban kutatják, keresik a besurranókat.
Alapvetően a játékosok különböző lehetőségeik közül körönként 4 akciót hajtanak végre (ha kettőt vagy kevesebbet, akkor eseménykártyát is húzunk). Meglesik a lefordított szobákat, mozognak, széfet törnek fel, próbálják elkerülni az élő erő mellett a beépített biztonsági berendezéseket is, vagy riasztást aktiválnak, hogy szorult helyzetben lévő „tesóikat” mentsék.
Amint minden széfből megvan a loot, irány a tető és győzelem. Ha az őrök valakit elkapnak, akkor az simán spicli lesz és a csapat veszít.
A szabályok aránylag könnyen elsajátíthatók (azért egy-két részletre érdemes odafigyelni, amiben a kisördög leledzik) és csapatjáték lévén elegendő egy személynek megértenie a szövegeket.
Külön plusz pont a játék tároló dobozának példaértékű kialakítása, valamint a megjelent 2. kiadású (angol) szabálykönyv, amely a játék fórumán felmerült kérdéseket is tisztázza, egyértelműsíti.
Kellemes kikapcsolódás, remek kaland, bár nem a könnyen teljesíthető fajtából. Ajánlott minden koop rajongónak.

Hát elég sok apróság van a szabályok közt (különleges helyzetek, egymásrahatások). Több mint öt parti alatt eddig mindig tökéletesítettük a szabályismeretet. Viszont eddig mindig sikeres volt a küldetés, bár talán csak az utolsó parti volt közel a tökéleteshez szabályilag. Viszont minden alkalommal borotvaélen táncoltunk. Tegnap  is csak a szerencsén múlott, hogy az utolsó bandatag szökése előtt az őr nem felé mozdult.

Fun, thematic co-op. Requires planning amongst the players, as long as the players' characters are on the same building floor. Unfortunately, the best strategy seems to be to split up the team among the floors. There are still interesting decisions to make though.
Difficulty is a bit random due to the large impact of how the tiles are randomized during setup. It's normally a fairly easy game though (harder with more players).

Very enjoyable co-op that delivers on theme and tension. The puzzle element of the gameplay does help to prevent the alpha player issue a little, at least until the whole map is revealed. On both recent sessions we failed, but only at the very end in cinematic fashion. I love the small box as well. As an introduction to co-ops I think this will begin to feature a lot in people's suggestions.

An easy to learn and teach co-op game that has a team of Oceans 11 wannabe safe-crackers trying to knock over the Burgle Brothers building in downtown Anytown, USA.  The goal:  loot.  A simple, yet clever, design that keeps things tense with the robotic security guards walking their beat and responding to tripped alarms.  The game plays quickly and smoothly and really hits a sweet spot in terms of time, complexity and most importantly, fun.  Comes in a small, compact box which I like, yet plays big.  Beautiful artwork and a great theme.  A game that puts a smile on your face.  A real winner.

電腦房 (Computer Room)：總共有 3 間對應指紋、雷射，以及動力板塊的電腦房，使用一個放在這裡的指示物以避開觸發一個警報。
門閂 (Deadbolt)：如果有玩家 (或保全) 不在這個板塊上，進入這個板塊要花 3 個行動點。如果你不能支付額外的行動點，你會停留在原本的板塊上。
指紋 (Fingerprint)：指紋是最棘手的警報。當你進入這個板塊時，除非你從指紋電腦房花費一個駭客指示物，否則一個警報就會響起。
門廳 (Foyer)：保全可以從相鄰的板塊看到這個板塊，但是不能穿牆。如果保全在一個相鄰的板塊，你會失去 1 個偷竊指示物。如果保全進入你所在的板塊，你一樣會失去另一個偷竊指示物。
鍵盤 (Keypad)：當移動到一個鍵盤板塊時，你必須猜出密碼。拿一顆骰子並擲它，如果骰出 6 點，你進入該板塊。如果沒有則留在原本的板塊。一旦你擲出 6 點，把一個開啟標記放到該板塊上，任何其他的玩家現在都可以自由進出該板塊，因為密碼已經知道了。同回合連續猜每次多一顆骰子，如果遊戲一開始你在這個房間或掉落到這個房間，你可以離開，但是必須要開啟它才能再回到這個房間。
實驗室 (Laboratory)：第一個進入這個板塊的玩家抽一張工具卡。
雷射 (Laser)：進入這個板塊花費 2 個行動點。如果你不能或不想花費額外的行動點，除非你能從雷射電腦房移除一個駭客指示物，否則一個警報會響起。
廁所 (Lavatory)：這個房間有 3 個隔間。當這個板塊翻開時，把 3 個偷竊指示物放在上面。當玩家在這個板塊時，他們可以使用放在這裡的偷竊指示物，而不是使用他們自己的偷竊指示物。玩家不能把這些指示物拿來當作他們自己的。
動力 (Motion)：你不能在一個回合中進入這個板塊又離開這個板塊。你必須停留在該板塊。如果你無法這麼做，除非你能從動力電腦房移除一個駭客指示物，否則一個警報會響起。
保險箱 (Safe)：保險箱是目標，擲出對號密碼來開啟保險箱

Challenging co-op game. 

Board is set up as three "floors" of the building, each a randomized set of 4x4 tiles. The goal is to find the safe and stairs on each floor and escape on the roof. The game gets harder and harder as the "treasures" you aquire from the safe are can make it easier for the guards to detect you and the guards also speed up their movement as well. You cannot truly breathe a sigh of relief until every last person has made it up to the roof.

I think one of the things that about co-op games is that the theme is pretty important. I really like the theme on this one and the fun, kinda tense feel of it. You feel not like you're altruistically planning for the best possible outcome but like you're a team of people in imminent danger.  The doors and the security guard are pretty neat too. (1 play)

This game breaks the mold of co-op games in recent years by bringing something very new and refreshing to the table: a 3D board game that is next-to-impossible to quarterback. Up to four players choose from 9 characters (each with unique powers) who must attempt to break into a building and steal the loot while avoiding guards who move on random, unpredictable paths in an effort to stop them. The game's 3D mechanic is similar in style to Betrayal at House on the Hill, but can be accompanied by a separately-purchased (or DIY) tower for added effect. The theme plays out perfectly - you really feel like burglars sneaking around and breaking into safes, while the game itself is a challenge. Normally difficult games have a tendency to be frustrating, I found it exhilarating, particularly because it requires you to work as a team (if one person gets caught, everyone loses). Couldn't recommend more highly.

RATING: 7
Really fun, light, co-op game.  Definitely play with a 3D tower setup of some sort.  Triggering patterns of alarms to occupy the guard seems kind of "gamey" to me, but it's still a very enjoyable game nonetheless.  Good times.

This is a great game which balances luck and strategy. It keeps you on your toes in an easy to play, but delightfully complex, game of a bank heist. This is one of those games that really brings out the best of cooperative board gaming. The rules were simple and easy to learn, as well as easy to track. Even with the freedom to make a choice and the full knowledge of how lightweight the game was, you felt the tension and pressure of the job and trying not to get squeezed by security.

If you haven't tried it, it's amazing.
If you have, you probably understand.

Every shelf should have this game.

I play the app version, which is a faithful rendition of the board game.  The game is completely engrossing and and, in your evasions of the guards, can be very tense.  A key thing for people trying it is that the game is *extremely* difficult, often unwinnable, if you play the default heist (The Bank Job) with a regular crew of four.  Try either the Office Heist with four or the Bank Heist with three.   The game would really be in the 9-10 range considering how obsessive I have found playing it.  All the randomized elements of the game give it enormous replayability, and, it's very thoughtfully balanced even if the sheer amount of randomness means that it is going to end up unbalanced (and probably not in your favor) sometimes.

A downside, though, is games can be really long, and you can play a single game for over an hour and then lose to some quirky element, like an aspect of the rules not quite working the way that you realized (also bad luck, but part of this game is that there are enough turns that part of the mental challenge is that you have to take into account that unlikely draws and rolls will absolutely happen over course of a game).  I think it would actually be extremely long and possibly painful to play with a group of people, and cannot imagine playing it with 4, and a big advantage the app is going to have over tabletop is that keeping track of the guard movement rules is likely a little tedious, whereas the guidance for it in the app is brilliant.

My favorite crew member, by far, is the Raven.

Burgle Bros. is the advanced version of Forbidden Desert. It takes the fun and style of Leacock's desert escape game, lays on a thick, fitting layer of theme, and then adds a degree of complexity to create a more satisfying co-op game.  Cat burglars attempting to get in to a building and escape with the loot, moving among the modular tiles to discover the safe without getting caught by the roving guards is a more difficult task than one might assume at the outset.  The cast of unique characters the player can choose from, the variety of loot, tools, and events, the near infinite number of wall layouts, and the added modules which complexify the game for the veteran player, make for a rich, re-playable experience. A great co-op game.  I've played this game with a variety of people and yet to find anyone who dislikes it.

The first time we played this game we didn't follow all the rules correctly (by accident) and I think that has coloured my view of this game since.

A pleasant co-op best played with David Holmes Ocean's ost behind it. Far more fun that I had initially expected. It has the sense of discovery that I enjoy in games (what's behind that door!) and I like how intuitive the game flows.

Fun game. You are working together to try and pull of an elaborate heist. There is a safe on each of 3 floors of a building, you must find each one, crack them and make it to the roof. The whole time trying to avoid the guards who prowl the halls complicating your attempts at a clean get away.

I like that the tension in the game builds. The guards move faster the closer you get to victory. The loot you steal from the safes hinders you in various ways. Each turn presents an interesting puzzle with a dash of uncertainty. You need to manipulate the guard's movement by tripping alarms, or switching floors.

The game is fairly difficult which is nice. If you have a problem with Alpha players this game might present an issue.

On par in weight with Matt Leacock's Forbidden Island and Forbidden Desert, but I found this one more interesting.  From a theme, it is fairly unmatched and it compliments the mechanisms very well. It has elements of luck, but most of the luck elements are fun to mitigate. The game isn't flawless, and the rulebook has typos and suffers from poor organization, but it's a light cooperative game definitely worth giving a try.

Easily one of my favorite games to play!

One of the most thematic, funnest, and charming co-op games I have ever played! Tim Fowers has done a fantastic job at creating an incredible co-op that really captures the feeling of pulling off your own heist.

Play-throughs are hard, and there is an easy and intuitive mechanic to quickly change the difficulty of the play-through by simply changing amount of stealth tokens that everyone starts out with. Every play-through also stays very fresh with the randomly-generated wall layouts from Tim Fowers's site mentioned in the rule book. With this generator, and any custom rules you would like to add, each play-through never feels boring.

I always appreciate original game mechanics or ideas, and this game is certainly quite unique. Players uncover tiles and try to unlock the safe while avoiding guards.

The game is solid and is fairly fun to play, but I think the game needs more variety. After about 3 games, the game starts to feel very same-y. Extra tiles (which could be swapped in) or missions to achieve would probably have improved the replayability.

Hát ezt tényleg a társaság, vagy a hangulat miatt játszanám újra, mert maga a játékmenet nem kimondottan nyűgözött le. Egyedi, érdekes, jó a téma, nagyon tematikusak az elemek, de ennél azért nagyobb kontrollra vágyom egy kooperatív játékban. Persze, valamilyen szinten biztosan lehet fejlődni benne, meg a tapasztalatokat minden bizonnyal kamatoztatni tudjuk, de nem valószínű, hogy komoly vágy ébred bennem, hogy kimaxoljam a játékot. Ettől függetlenül, ahogy az első mondatban is említettem, nem zárkózom el az újabb partiktól.

Completely won over after two games. I'm normally left a bit cold by pure, open-communication co-op, but this a great little roguelike, the casually random cards setting up a lot of agonising and thematic little situations. There's a lot of skill to get your teeth into, with a lovely shift of realisation when you see that the alarms aren't always barriers and can be barrelled through to distract the guard.

RATING: 10
I've never started a game at a 10 before but I found this game to be the most refreshing Coop I've ever played (Besides Mechs and Minions) and very thematic.  I also own one of the 3D Deluxe Towers.  I'm pretty sure my rating will hold upon even more plays and can't wait to see what my wife or 8 yr old think of this one.
I've played over 2000+ different board games and am getting bored to death with new games, kickstarter or otherwise, that to me are just tiresome and more of the same.  This Coop is as refreshing a Cooperative game as I've experienced in a long time (Besides Mechs and Minions again).
I have not played with 4, but don't think I would like it.  Even with 2 it gets very difficult whenever two players are on any same floor.  The game is brilliant in that there are multiple ways to get back to a floor on your own (Stairs, Secret Passage, A Down Escalator of sorts, etc.)  With 4 you would be stuck forever with at least one floor with 2.  I'm sure it would still be fun but doubt I'd feel its 10/10 then (Maybe still an 8 or 9?).  For 1, 2 or 3 players though... 10/10!

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Not a fan of the odd box size, but perhaps that is becoming Fowler's calling card as it is the same size as Paperback. Game play is an interesting puzzle and while I think we'll easily win more than we'll lose, it is quite a puzzle to work through and one can make the puzzles quite a bit more challenging...and perhaps impossible. Had a good time playing my first game as we puzzled out loud together and worked together well and everyone was having a good time. A couple people being on the same floor is quite challenging and quite dangerous!

I really have to hand it to Tim Fowers for this design. Everything about it is professional and if I didn't know any better I would never guess that this was a Kickstarter game. The graphic design is some of the best i have seen on any published game (big publisher to small), and the game design is extremely tight. Overall the gameplay is a cooperative puzzle/push your luck game that plays extremely quickly. The rules are perfect for the weight of the game with only minimum overhead in the game. The rules could have been a little bit more comprehensive, but most rulesbooks could be. The game is absolute blast to play. Its difficulty level is exactly right for a cooperative game, and it even has different modes to adjust the difficulty. One of the things I most enjoy about the game is that it has an element of push-your-luck in it. Most often time games with push-your-luck only revolve around that one mechanic and don't offer more. What you have here is a game that uses push-your-luck but has so much more. 

Bravo Mr. Fowers! I will be watching what you come out with in the future.

Wir sind Einbrecher und versuchen 3 Safes in 3 Stockwerken zu knacken und dann übers Dach zu fliehen.
Ich bin als Fasadenkletterer direkt in der ersten Runde nach oben geklettert, hab das Stockwerk durchsucht, den Safe prepariert und war gerade am knacken, als ich über Funk hörte: MOMENT! Safe 1 wurde im EG geknackt und wir haben eine Schlüsselkarte gefunden. Weitere Safes nicht ohne diese ID Karte knacken.
Die anderen beiden haben das erste Stock durchsucht und sind auf massig Hindernisse gestossen, konnten aber den Safe knacken und zu 50% auch den 2. Stock erreichen.
Da ich meinen Safe nicht mehr knacken durfte, beschloss ich den 3. Stock zu erkunden. Mein Kompane wurde immernoch im 1. OG von der einen Wache in Schach gehalten, unsere Komplizin hat sich derweil im 2. OG am Safe zu schaffen gemacht und rennt jetzt mit einen Gemälde und ID Karte herum.
Also der Kumpane dann endlich mal aus dem Ersten harauskommen konnte, hat er sich im Zweiten erstmal in der Toilette verschanzt, in der auch prompt der Wächter des 2. OGs nachgeschaut hat!!!
Schlussendlich rannte er nur noch nach oben und raus auf den Helikopterplatz, währen wir die restliche Arbeit machten...
Sehr tolles und thematisches Spiel. Man kann sich da eine richtige Geschichte dazu ausdenken wärend dem Spielen.

On the one hand, I have to sort of bite my tongue on Kickstarter stuff, at least for a day or so. Burgle Bros was the final remaining game I backed on KS before realizing that many of my backs were pointless and I was better off ignoring it. Burgle Bros got backed because it looked nice and I really liked the heist theme.

It turns out it's a really fun game. It moves away from the direction of many co-ops, with a constant, tenacious threat instead of making you play whack-a-mole with pop-up disasters. The guards are just brutal, and not learning guard management fast will knock you out in no time. It's a tough game (a rule we messed up made it even tougher) but it's a lot of fun to play, and we got a lot of great "story" moments out of it. Like the other game I've seen from Time Fowers, it's got a great look to it. The art by Ryan Goldsberry is top-notch.

However, all is not fantastic here. There is a deck of "Event" cards you can draw from by sacrificing actions. I can't see ANY reason to do so. The events are sort of split between good and bad ones, but the good ones are only sort of okay and several bad ones that can be devastating. Considering you're giving up actions to get them, they are simply not worth it. Furthermore, the events resolve immediately, so even a lot of the "good" ones can be useless if they happen at the wrong time. In our game I went first and decided to grab an event (we had not looked at them in advance) just to see what we got and it was a horrible one that smacked us down right out of the gate. After seeing a few more, and after looking through them after our game (which we lost), I would rather spend actions doing NOTHING than risk that deck. 

Second, when we opened our first safe, the loot we got was a Persian Cat, which had an "ability". I looked in the rulebook to understand the ability and there was no mention of it. Heading to BGG, I see this from Fower:

[q]cat is attracted to the nearest room with an alarm icon at the start of the turn of the player holding him. it does not take an action to pick the cat back up once you are in his tile.

Sorry, the loot was a stretch goal and I didn't clarify them in the rules more.[/q]

That is absolutely infuriating and one of my key problems with Kickstarter. You are producing a game, produce that game. I'm already not down with taking a supposedly finished and tested design and then throwing in a bunch of new additional stuff just because you got more cash, but when you don't even include rules about the new additional stuff? Because they were a last-minute addition? That's obnoxious, and does not add to my already shaky confidence in KS games to begin with. 

(To be honest, the loot "abilities" can probably just be ignored, especially at first. They add unnecessary difficulty to an already tough task.)

Despite all that I still am glad to have a different kind of cooperative game at hand. Hopefully I can get my co-op-averse group to keep playing.

A clever and highly attractive coöp.  It's a little brutal (as good coöps ought to be) and highly random in its set-up.  But it's also direct in its game play.  The AI is pretty neat and the combination mechanic is much more satisfying than its first "just throw some dice" impression might leave you with.  Not as accessible as Matt Leacock's Forbidden series, but probably a good next step for interested intro games past those.

Have you ever wanted to poorly rob a bank or an office building or Fort Knox without so much as a floor plan? Maybe with a poorly networked group of friends culled from the circus? Perhaps you've fancied hanging out with some twat with a bird and a midget that climbs stuff, or perhaps Danny Trejo with a stick of fucking dynamite and a Geisha in white face paint? It's basically a solitaire game that other people can join in on.  Very susceptible to Alpha Gamer Syndrome. Still great, either way.

Picked up on a whim, Dec 2015. Solid co-op, lots of variability, easy set up, drips with theme, enough randomness to make decisions tense, and did I mention it drips with theme? I built a quick and dirty foam board building, and it really ads to the magic of this game. I plan to purchase the  wooden version.

Just a great thematic co-op game. The different character powers, loot cards, and floor layouts in addition to the variable tile setup give an amazing amount of replayability. There's always a story about how you blew up the secret door into the bathroom, or the guard caught you because you couldn't get the painting through the service duct. 

I'd even say it's easier to teach than Pandemic. Special movement and action rules are spelled out on the relevant cards or tiles so you don't have to remember them. You don't always have that feeling of impending disaster that Pandemic tends to give, though, if that's your thing.

Very enjoyable CO-OP, have played with 2 small floors, 3 small floors and 2 large floors + lost visual and using the advanced characters. Can be harder to win with more than 2 players, but is fine. Like how the whole game works together, has a sense of humour, fits in a small box and visually is very appealing. Makes for a sometime tense game, as you need to crack all the safes before anyone can leave and the loot (esp the gold bar) can throw a spanner in the works, along with Dead Men Tell No Tales is my favourite of the somewhat easier CO-OPs that is very thematic, great game! Also isn't overly random as you can work out where the guard has been, event cards are a nice touch.

RATING: 7.5
fully co-op bank / office robbers puzzle game - similar mecanics to forbidden island / desert but themed around a heist (Think oceans eleven) each player has a character with a special ability on either side of there card - pick a side and use that for the game.
The object of the game is to rob the safe on each floor (2 floors for easy level 3 for hard). each floor is made up of a 4 by 4 grid of face down room tiles (always a safe and stairs on each floor) - Find the safe and crack it on each floor and escape the 3rd floor via stairs to win - the other face down tiles are usally bad rooms like alarms of deadbolts etc. Also on each floor is a security guard which will take one of your stealth tokens (lifes) if he is ever on the same tile as another players character

ben after this game since I saw it on GAMENIGHT! but couldn't find in anywhwere - Picked it up at 2016 expo

Love this game fairly light weight but much more enjoyable than forbidden island / desert.

Light, puzzly coops aren't my favorite genre, but Flash Point is one I enjoy quite a bit.  Burgle Bros has quickly joined the ranks right behind Flash Point for me.  Lots of variability makes it easy to come back to again and again.  

Love how the guards move and the fact that you can manipulate the alarms to help your teammates.  Love the box size!  I'm tired of oversized games that take up too much shelf space.  I get rid of a lot of games I like (but don't love) because they take up too much space.  Won't have that problem with BB.

One downside for me is 90+ minutes is too long for a light coop.  45 minutes would be perfect.  I also find the walls to be a bit fiddly and drives me a little crazy that things don't line up nicely so I don't look forward to setting the game up.  Maybe I just need to buy a wood holder for the map.

I love the Oceans heist movies and when this hit Kickstarter i was pumped! Great fluid play, tense and simple to learn. Not easy to win either, and sometimes the security guards “know” your every move before you do it, other times it’s awesome triggering alarms making guards run around while you and your friends escape with the loot! Such a good game. And my wife loves heist movies as well so this is a winner.

Guys. Burgle Bros is a riot. Play it with your family/friends for a nail-bitingly tense experience with great story-telling moments and laughs. Though not without it flaws (what game is without at least SOME shortcomings?), Burgle Bros delivers a thematic game with clean mechanics, and that little extra spark that makes a cooperative game the fun team-building experience that it can be. Quite possibly my favorite co-op to date. It's hard, but beatable. It has a lot of variation built in too. Too many board games are so serious now, but Burgle Bros has a lighthearted fun feeling to it. Just try it. You'll probably like it.

This game has sky rocketed into my top ten in a very short amount of time, and sits at number two now.
I had rated this a nine first, because it's not that thinky and because of the alpha player risk, but after some more thought I realize that those two aspects are main factors in making it playable with my kids and "casual gamer" friends (if it was very thinky it would be too hard for them, and if there was no alpha opportunity, there would also not be an opportunity to do a bit of coaching them every now and then), so I decided to just rate it based on its value as a family friendly co-op (without getting too simplistic) or solo game with many ways to up the difficulty, giving it a very wide appeal to anybody that likes co-ops. So this is now my second game (out of 600+) that I gave the maximum rating. 
LOVE IT!

RATING: 7
[B]TTS Play:[/B] On floor three of my first play (The Acrobat/The Rigger).  Liking the art more than I thought I would, although I still feel a more "serious" or "adult" theme would make it more appealing - but I understand the need to be more mass market - especially since the mechanics are well developed. There is a some room here for heist centered emerging narrative and the way the room tiles all interact is really interesting.  However, after repeated plays some of the decisions and tension is a bit repetitive. UPDATE: Found the final safe and had two dice on it, but before we could start cracking the guard spoiled all the fun - looking forward to trying again. UPDATE: The second game (The Spotter/The Hawk) was much smoother - forgot to roll often for my Loot (barking Chihuahua), but tiles were placed in more helpful positions and The Hawk's ability to peek through walls was powerful.  First successful heist!

I am torn between getting the cardboard, playing on TTS, or just waiting for the app and playing it purely solo electronically. Regardless, my first play was enjoyable.  Now leaning to getting just the iOS version, as there are deeper solo games I enjoy more - although this could change at some point.  UPDATE: Bought the iOS Universal app (Fowers Games Inc.) and am loving it.  Burgle Bros in your hands for only 5 bucks!

*警報響時放紅骰跟指示物在該點，兩個以上警報會找近的走
**進階 牆可依特定規則放，越多死路越難
**基礎難度 辦工工作 ****
>僅使用有白色圓圈版塊，造兩層樓，牆根據規則書，保全點數2/3在1/2樓
**專家難度 ****
>兩層樓，形成5x5(兩層都有一個空格要相同)，每層樓12牆隨意放，巡邏卡分成兩疊並各別洗混 (白色圈圈用於一樓、黑色圈圈用於二樓)。當翻開巡邏卡時，如果卡片上顯示一個紅色三角形，就代表這裡是保全的目的地 (不是原本紅色正方形所指定的目的地)。把第 1 層樓保全骰轉到 3 點，第 2 層樓轉到 4 點
**迷你擴充：失去視覺**
每個巡邏牌庫洗進 1 張失去視覺卡，抽到失去視覺卡時，保全從圖板上移除，下個玩家的回合，，抽下一張巡邏卡並把他放在指定的地點，抽第二張卡片決定他新的目的地。
中庭 (Atrium)：你可以偷看這個板塊上面或下面的板塊。保全可以從這個板塊看到上面或下面，這可能會讓你失去 1 個偷竊指示物。
攝影機 (Camera)：當保全在一個攝影機板塊時(經過也算)，他可以看見其它樓層所有的攝影機板塊。你不會失去偷竊指示物，但是他們會觸發你所在板塊的一個警報 (藉由無線電呼叫)。
電腦房 (Computer Room)：總共有 3 間對應指紋、雷射，以及動力板塊的電腦房，使用一個放在這裡的指示物以避開觸發一個警報。
門閂 (Deadbolt)：如果有玩家 (或保全) 不在這個板塊上，進入這個板塊要花 3 個行動點。如果你不能支付額外的行動點，你會停留在原本的板塊上。
指紋 (Fingerprint)：指紋是最棘手的警報。當你進入這個板塊時，除非你從指紋電腦房花費一個駭客指示物，否則一個警報就會響起。
門廳 (Foyer)：保全可以從相鄰的板塊看到這個板塊，但是不能穿牆。如果保全在一個相鄰的板塊，你會失去 1 個偷竊指示物。如果保全進入你所在的板塊，你一樣會失去另一個偷竊指示物。
鍵盤 (Keypad)：當移動到一個鍵盤板塊時，你必須猜出密碼。拿一顆骰子並擲它，如果骰出 6 點，你進入該板塊。如果沒有則留在原本的板塊。一旦你擲出 6 點，把一個開啟標記放到該板塊上，任何其他的玩家現在都可以自由進出該板塊，因為密碼已經知道了。同回合連續猜每次多一顆骰子，如果遊戲一開始你在這個房間或掉落到這個房間，你可以離開，但是必須要開啟它才能再回到這個房間。
實驗室 (Laboratory)：第一個進入這個板塊的玩家抽一張工具卡。
雷射 (Laser)：進入這個板塊花費 2 個行動點。如果你不能或不想花費額外的行動點，除非你能從雷射電腦房移除一個駭客指示物，否則一個警報會響起。
廁所 (Lavatory)：這個房間有 3 個隔間。當這個板塊翻開時，把 3 個偷竊指示物放在上面。當玩家在這個板塊時，他們可以使用放在這裡的偷竊指示物，而不是使用他們自己的偷竊指示物。玩家不能把這些指示物拿來當作他們自己的。
動力 (Motion)：你不能在一個回合中進入這個板塊又離開這個板塊。你必須停留在該板塊。如果你無法這麼做，除非你能從動力電腦房移除一個駭客指示物，否則一個警報會響起。
保險箱 (Safe)：保險箱是目標，擲出對號密碼來開啟保險箱 
掃描器 (Scanner)：如果在你進入這個板塊時，你持有一個工具或贓物，一個警報會響起。
秘密之門 (Secret Door)：你可以從相鄰的板塊穿牆進入這個板塊。這是一個單向的通道；你不能經由穿牆偷看或移動回這個板塊。保全不能穿過秘密之門。
維修通道 (Service Duct)：一旦兩個通道都發現了，它們可以當作是傳送點。玩家可以用 1 個行動點在它們之間移動，並且忽略它們所在的樓層。
樓梯 (Stairway)：樓梯讓你可以直接往上移動一個樓層。把一個下樓指示物放在上面樓層對應的板塊上 (例如第 2 列、第 3 欄的位置)。你也可以偷看樓上的板塊並回到樓下。遊戲結束時，從樓梯到屋頂需要花費 1 點行動點。
熱力 (Thermo)：如果你在一個熱力板塊上結束你的行動，警報會響起
走道 (Walkway)：如果這個板塊你是因為移動到這裡而翻開，該玩家掉落 1 個樓層。當掉落時，這不算作是進入該板塊。如果你已經在最底部的樓層，不會有事發生。任何在翻開這個板塊後才進入這個板塊的玩家，不會發生掉落的事件，但是可以花費 1 個行動點從這裡下樓 (這不算作是進入)。這是個一單向的通道，你不能從這個板塊下面的樓層爬上來。

Co-op multi-story building heist. Soooo good. Very hard to win but each time you lose it makes you want to play again and again. It's very much like Invisible Inc. in board-game form.

One of the best games I've played in years. Notably, the relationship between theme and mechanics is perfectly balanced. We spent as much time working out how to win as we did enjoying the filmic quality of being involved in a heist. Brilliantly designed and full of atmosphere, this is a cracker of a game.

Very tense and thematic. Lots of strategies to avoid being caught by guards. Does get a big repetitive, though that may be because we always play the default layout. Fun and casual at 2p, very hard at 4p with make-or-break decisions happening frequently.

RATING: 8
"Fun co-op with an awesome heist theme. I seem to enjoy it more than others. It is a bit long and swingy, but I just find it very fun. I like the stories it tells."

What I like:
- Very thematic
- Straightforward gameplay, and moves quickly
- Some funny stories can come out of the gameplay
- Pretty high variability between games
- The box is small

What I don't like:
- Takes more table space than one might hope
- At times, the randomness might be a bit much
- Others aren't convinced all the characters are balanced
- The box is an awkward shape

I kickstarted this, based on enjoying Paperback, and because Rahdo's runthrough looked great. It's early, but so far it's pretty much what I expected. There is some randomness, but hopefully it won't overwhelm the game. Our 2p learning game (2 floors) took 40 minutes. 

I think the BGG weight of 2.1 seems about right.

Played the app. I gave this game a chance. It was fun the first few times but quickly became very tedious. Very difficult to win and after losing about 15 games in a row I gave up and deleted it as I also got tired of swearing at it.  It’s mostly a solo game  and I don’t really care for solo or co-op. To quote another user “Coops are not games, they are puzzles.”  So why would you want to win at this game? I don’t know. After losing yet another game to some stupid random occurrence I thought about playing again but realized it wasn’t giving me any satisfaction because I wasn’t playing against an actual person. Beating a random scenario generator,  after attempting it 50 times, holds zero appeal for me.

A fun co-op game where you get to play the bad guys (safe crackers). The hidden rooms (tiles) and roaming security guards (based on cards) keeps the game fresh every time. Needing to roll for the correct safe combination is a great mechanic as well.

6 Plays - This game has a very 'puzzle-like' feel about it. A very good co-op with plenty of variability between plays. Don't be fooled by it's seemingly light and fun theme, it does require careful planning/ thought to win. My issue with it, is that the guards can be a little too unpredictable with their movement, especially as you move up to higher building levels. This takes the fun of planning away, as players away end up hoping for lucky card draws instead. Personally, I like some luck in games, as long as there is a way to swing the odds in your favour. In this though, I have found myself frustrated with unlucky card draws a lot. All in all though its good, but as per the BGG rating system, the nit pick takes it from an 8 to a 6 for me.

Fantastic game.  It takes a fun little spin on the style of co-op gameplay ushered in by Pandemic, and makes it a little more tongue-in-cheek.  Great use of theme, not only in terms of the fact that we're pulling off a heist, Ocean's 11 style, but integration into the rules, like the fact the guards that are trying to catch you only move if you're on the same floor as that guard.  The manual explains, "After all, in a movie, time only moves when the camera is on you."  Fantastically clever, well worth the purchase.  The variability in set-up and the large amount of characters (each with 2 different sides to choose from) make it highly replayable.

Set-up is a bit of bind, and it takes up a lot of space, but once it is set up, this is a fun co-operative game that is quick to learn. It would be nice to have the tower that allows the floors to be stacked, but the KS price for that with shipping was disproportionately high. We need to find someone with a laser cutter to knock one up.

Played two games on the easy difficulty, one with 2 players and one with 3. They seemed a bit too easy, though we did almost lose with 3 players (I think more players may increase the difficulty). I need to play on the normal difficulty and see what kind of difference it makes.
The theme is solid and the coop play is pretty good too. It's not overly long and despite some chance, there is a good amount of strategizing.
I think Sub Terra is still my favorite co-op, but Burgle Bros. is also pretty good and probably my number two choice.

Another co-op! Geepers all of these co-ops. It is a very light co-op to try and escape with the treasure. We played the shortened version of only 2 levels and I actually think that was enough. If it went on for much longer I think it would have been a bit too long. I like the art and design but I am just not that into co-ops. I don't think I have to play this again, but I would if requested.

Common Geekbuddy opinion is that the game is too long and Forbidden Desert is a better option.....but....the theme here is more appealing (especially since my wife is an Oceans Eleven fan) plus there is a varied and relatable narrative. However....I've since purchased and played alot of Magic Maze which may make the need for Burgle Bros redundant....

First played as a 2-player game with all three floors. Most enjoyable gaming experience for ages! Very close, but we escaped.

After getting my own copy have since played solo with two characters and again won in a tense finish. I consulted with my friend who introduced me to the game; he said that he'd played a 4-player game with his family and again they'd escaped in a close finale. This seems to indicate that the game is well balanced and that a little adjustment with an optional rule or two should increase the challenge.

Girlfriend approved! Fun sandbox with tons of variability and suspense! I love so much about this game: the cat and mouse mechanics, the dice rolling elements, the forbidden dessert like safe combinations, the different room types, the simplicity of rules, the super cool box (love how it matches paperback), the wooden walls, the "meeples", the artwork, and the square cards! All these little nuances have made this game a favorite gem in my collection.

If there was an expansion, I would like to see a deck for wall layouts. Perhaps another mode of play where the upper floor walls are revealed only when you enter the floor ("Unprepared and without blueprints mode"!).

Another expansion idea might be a "legacy" deck of office layouts and objectives. perhaps there are two offices, connected by a pedway. Guards could cross pedways if there were alarms...

Perhaps these little addons could be sold in small packs like how star realms expansions are sold.

Despite some reservation because of not enjoying Fowers' Paperback, I enjoyed this play with three players. The Hawk and the Hacker were far more useful than my 'advanced' Spotter and I proved to be a liability after quickly losing three stealth only to go and hide in the toilet. The first two floors went well, but we floundered on the last, with the Hacker stuck in the open as the Guard moved five. For a 'mechanical' rather than thematic co-op, Burgle Bros tells a good story and looks to be difficult enough - though possible - that success would be joyously felt.

Co-op "Ocean's Eleven" type heist game. Theme has broad appeal, easy to introduce (gateway). Reminds me most of Forbidden Desert as well as co-ops in similar vein (Forbidden Island, Pandemic): 4 action points, special character abilities, grid movement, flip tiles, column/row alignment, etc.
Can be a bit lengthy for the full game, but quicker variants exist

This is a very cute looking game where players are robbers trying to break into safes and avoid the wandering security guard. Each player gets their own player power, which adds a lot to the strategy of the game. In our first game we lost right away due to pure bad luck. In game two it took us a lot longer to lose. I liked a lot of what I saw here, but one element I wasn't a fan of is that the more players are on a floor, the faster the guards move. This means that it makes sense to leave players behind on previous floors that are already done being explored and resolved, to sort of manage the speed of the guards more. This means those players don't have much of interest to do for a decent portion of the game. I realize the game is meant to be a quick 45 min romp, and if it had ended in that time, the downtime of being strategically left behind wouldn't be so bad. I'd like to try it again soon to see how it plays when people are more familiar with the workings.

A wonderful puzzle with a light-hearted heist theme. On the higher floors the guards move fast enough that you don't necessarily have much of an idea of where they will be on the next character's turn - so a bit of luck. There is a lot of variety - all room tiles are used in the full, three-floor game, but all (except stairs and safes) are mixed up, so you never know how many alarms etc a particular floor will have - except the third floor of course if you have revealed all other tiles when you get there.
I absolutely love this kind of puzzle. I would probably have loved it even more if the guards' moving was more predictable so that it would be more puzzle and less luck. But I love it as it is too.

I had a lot of fun learning this game. I absolutely love the theme. The quality is perfectly fine (though it is a lot of bits and a rather large footprint). It takes me about 15 mins to set up a 2 floor game, and around an hour and a quarter to play it. That's too long for me, most of my games play in under 40 mins. But it packs up small and is fun, both solo and with others. Now that this is an iOS app (which solves the setup and footprint issues) I most just play it on my phone.

Kickstarter project - didn't back but the game looks like a fun, family/light/med weight co-op about being burglars. Look for it when it's released in stores. Stretch goals didn't add a whole lot to the game so the retail copy will probably have most of the upgraded component stretch goals anyway. Pledge amount was $29. Releases October 2015.

I Kickstarted this one and I've enjoyed it a whole lot. It's not hard to teach, and even my friends and family who don't like playing board games as much as I do got into it and enjoyed it. It's a fun, strategic cooperative game that requires a bit of planning. I also really like the sort of "AI" that the guards on each floor have; it's a cool way to handle that in a cooperative game.

There is a lot of game in this little box. The rules are simple. You can pretty much set up and start playing immediately, however, there's a lot of planning and tactics involved based on the movement of the guards. The room tiles can reveal some pretty dangerous areas or you can luck out with a well placed safe or staircase. The way the game is setup means no two plays should ever be the same.

Overall, Burgle Bros really delivers. I had high expectations and they were exceeded. My only concern is the length of the game, which can go long if players are afraid to lose stealth tokens or a guard is being especially tricky to avoid, but a long game of Burgle Bros probably means a tense game, and there is definitely merit in that.

Superb! Love this game and really lends itself to thematic situations and memorable encounters. Fun to talk about afterwards: "oh, remember when that thing happened that one time....."

RATING: 8
Pros
1. Excellent thematic integration
2. Good art
3. Nice pieces
4. A nice true co-op (no traitors etc.)

Cons
1. The box is terrible. The pieces really don't fit back in the box well and forget about sleeving the cards. Burgle Bros comes in second place for bad boxes, right behind the (effectively) disposable original pixel tactics boxes.
2. The square cards are an odd size (65mm x 65mm) which is a bit to small for the typical FFG square sleeve size.

A játék nagyon jó és hangulatos. A szabályok egyszerűek, ugyanakkor nagyon oda kell figyelni, mert sok apróság akad. A szerencsének viszonylag nagy a szerepe, de ez számomra itt kevéssé zavaró, mert rettenetesen beleélhetjük magunkat a "mackósok" dolgába.
A megvalósítás kiváló, a doboz nagyon ki van találva, és tök jó, hogy a lehető legkisebb.

Really fun light/medium co-op that is distinct enough from Pandemic.

It isn't a 10 because set-up is a tad long and the game kind of cheats to get a close ending -- the first floor is so easy and the last floor can be hard due to the guard chaotically bouncing around.

Played a prototype of this many years ago. I can't remember exactly what changed in the production version but the game was well made. Fun coop puzzle game but just like other coop (e.g., Pandemic) there is clear good and bad moves, and thus alpha player problem exists. Probably the best Tim Fowers game I've played thus far.

[BGCOLOR=#000000][COLOR=#FFFFFF]SoloX.[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] Wow, it may be my favorite co-op game ever. Not at all complicated, yet it felt like really exploring a building as you sneak around looking for each safe while not blowing your cover. The roles work well to facilitate teamwork, and yet it really felt like collaboration on figuring out where to go and what to do, without any "alpha player" effects.

I think I'd like my own copy, and I definitely want to play it more.

Update: traded for my own copy, woot! Need to try it with family and friends.

Nagyon egyedi játék, amiben a játékosok egy rablóbanda tagjait alakítják. Céljuk egy épület mindhárom szintjén a kasszák megfúrása és a szerzett zsákmánnyal a tetőn keresztül való menekülés. Ezt nehezíti a különböző riasztó szobák és a szinteken szolgálatot teljesítő őrök. A játék meglehetősen nehézre sikeredett. Nagyon komoly összjáték és jól kigondolt stratégia szükségeltetik a nyeréshez. A jól kitalált, szerepek korrekten működnek. Nem egy korszakalkotó társas, de mindenképpen üde színfolt.

Absolutely fantastic co-op game and one that my gaming group are ALWAYS up for playing!  

I built my own game tower so the floors could be elevated which really gives a greater sense of a high rise heist.  Highly recommend buying the tower or making your own.

This game should be in the 8+ rating category.  Wish more people knew about it as I prefer it over most other "popular" co-op games.

This is a great thematic co-op. Playing from base set up its probably one of the easier co-ops out there but it's ripe for adding the difficulty levels. Speed up the patrol men or give your self less stealth tokens as you gain experience. 

There's plenty of tongue in cheek humour in this package too. Just don't trip the alarm.

This is a great light-weight cooperative that plays just as well or better as a solo puzzle. There's plenty of strategy in how to best take advantage of your individual character powers, utilize alarms to redirect guards, etc. But luck will always play a pretty significant, sometimes hilarious, role. (Tip: do not trust the event deck. If it shows you kindness, it is only to lull you into complacency.)

The movie heist-caper theme shows through every aspect of the game, and there's a lot of fun for the both the tactician and the gambler. 

There are multiple ways to setup the board, with 3 different variants included in the box. This, combined with the random distribution of cards, tiles, and characters, should make for a different feeling game every time.

Those with no sense of humor, an extreme aversion to chance, or with play groups that cannot resist alpha-gaming each other's turns should look elsewhere.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Heist-themed puzzle co-op with great art. Players control thief tokens, each with a special power, who enter a building consisting of 3 floors of 16 (4x4) face-down room tiles, some separated by impassable walls. 

A player's turn consists of four actions spent moving, peeking at adjacent tiles, hacking, attempting to open safes, using that character's special power etc. Tiles include alarms, staircases (the only way up to the next floor), computer rooms (prevent other alarm tiles going off) and, most critically, safes: get the loot from each floor and escape through the roof helipad to win. 

After each turn, the guard on that floor will move. If an alarm has been triggered then the guard will move towards it, but otherwise moves in a semi-random patrol pattern -- players know the next destination, but not the one after that. Guard speed increases (and therefore becomes less predictable) as the game goes on and as alarms are triggered.

In addition to the random tile distribution and guard movement, there is randomness in the form of rooms requiring dice rolls to pass (keypads, safes) and various card draws. Loot tends to inhibit character who pick it up, like the prize chihuaha that barks and causes an alarm on a roll of 6. If players take 2 or fewer actions then they draw an event card, sometimes good and sometimes bad, and laboratories provide random equipment.

It's tough in games like this to get the balance right between puzzle (dry, boring) and randomness (unexpected twists, can be capricious, possibility of degenerate outcomes either too easy or too hard). Burgle Bros. runs the gamut. Some turns are easy and obvious and so the puzzle seems soulless, but the randomness does generate exciting decisions about risks worth taking. On the flipside, it's easily possible for a player to be hosed by a random event, bad loot or guard movement; to have layouts with, say, all of the computers on the top floor and make hacking worthless (or on the ground floor and make it too easy); or to have a safe in a key passageway constantly patrolled by a guard.

This gets less fun later in the game when stealth tokens diminish and one bit of bad luck means guaranteed loss. Unlike Pandemic et al, it rarely feels like the consequence of a misguided earlier decision coming, just like bad luck. (Particularly frustrating is the case when a player is forced to take fewer than three actions to avoid a guaranteed loss and then draws an event card, which itself forces game over.) Still, the total package is rather charming, and it can tell a good story if you're not too unlucky.

RATING: 6.5
I liked a lot of what this game had to offer, but the length really drags it down.  Pandemic or Forbidden Desert takes an hour, and I think you end up with about as many interesting decisions in double that time with this one.  I still enjoyed my one play, and I'd play some more to see if my rating goes up, but I think the length would often keep it from the table.

A good redesign of the Leacock system. There is enough going on that players need to figure out the best way to play the system, as well as getting immersed in the theme of the game. Lots of good ideas at play, with often tense gameplay moments.

Really enjoyable co-op game, a sure way to level up your group's co-op gameplay from say, Forbidden Island. Absolutely love the art of the game, from its tiles to the individual character pieces. 

The Rules booklet is really dense though. It's basically a ~20 page manual with tons of text that will require you to spend time reading and referencing. Even then during play, our group came up with a lot of "what ifs" to some of the rules, which we had to make guesses about. 

I've played The Office Job, the beginner scenario, twice now with max 4 players and boy, the game can be pretty unforgiving. Normally I don't like a ton of dice-rolling as a mechanic, but it is an amazing feeling when someone in the group rolls the number for a combination to a locked room or a safe. Exuberant cheering and high fives when it happens.

RATING: 3
I bought this mostly to support Tim Fowers, a creative designer who sells his games independently. Sad to say, however, that I'm rapidly souring on co-op games. 

The positives of this one:

-Quarterbacking is somewhat mitigated because the decision space is pretty limited. I suppose that's damning with faint praise, since I prefer games with a large decision space, but there you have it. Not a lot of opportunity for Pandemic-style experienced-player domination simply because it's really obvious what you should do.

-Variability of setup: you can create hundreds of scenarios out of whole cloth here.

-This game has a fun, cartoonish sense of humor. It does make me smile sometimes.

It's not a bad game, even in a vacuum. If you're a fan of co-ops, you'll probably really like this.

This game is difficult! So difficult that I keep wondering if we are somehow playing incorrectly. But with time we have gotten slightly better. We have never won, and though we have similar lack of success with other co-ops like ghost stories, I never necessarily think it's because I need to play better. Not destined to be a classic, perhaps, but the theme and art is really lovely and it does provide a new co-op feeling.

Probably my go-to cooperative game. I haven't introduced it to a single group without success-- everyone has enjoyed this game!

Just looking at the size and art on the exterior of the box, you can see it's cleverly designed.

There are a bunch of silly but thematically canon events which are equal parts helpful and hurtful. Love to play! (10-20-17)

We're loving this co-op game. The theme is fun and the tension really comes out as you work your way through the building trying to avoid guards and find the safe.  We have tried playing with more players (we have a family of 5) and while it is possible it makes the game much more difficult (since the guard moves between each player's turn).  Our win-loss rate still isn't great but the fun is definitely there.

A silly alternative to Pandemic in a super small package. The difficulty really seems to ramp up as you increase the player count.

Randomized setups can really stack the deck against you. Conversely a lucky break in tile placement can hand you a successful heist. 

My concern here is replayability. We'll see if I have the desire to return after a few more plays.

This game had caught my interest a while back, and I had watched a runthrough of how the game played. But my groups don't always love co-op games and I put this on the back burner. So I was happy to try it when it showed up at game night.

The game comes with 48 tiles that you lay out into 3 4x4 grids. Each grid represents a different floor in the building. There are some wooden walls that get laid out in particular arrangements. Each floor has a safe and a stairway up. Your goal is to find the safe on each floor, crack it, and go to the next floor. Players can be on different floors, but no one can make it to the roof until all the safes have been cracked.

To make all this a little more difficult, each floor has a guard patrolling the floor. There is a deck of destination cards for each floor, and the guard starts with some amount of movement points (2 for the 1st floor, 3 for the second, 4 for the third). After a player's movement, the guard on that floor will move, heading to his current destination, moving however many spaces he has for movement. The guard will take the shortest route, but if there are multiple choices he'll favor the leftmost one.

There are any number of alarms and when a player triggers an alarm the guard will reroute to that location and start running (moving one faster for each alarm that was active this round). After the guard reaches the alarm he'll shut it off and go back to his regular patrol, unless there are other alarms. If you ever get caught by the guard you give up a stealth token. If you can't, the players lose the game.

On your turn, you have four action points. You can spend them to move into a space, peek into a space (which reveals the tile but doesn't commit you to moving there), use your special power, crack a safe or buy an event tile. To crack a safe, you add dice to a safe or roll all the dice on that safe. You put a cracked token on every tile that in the same column or row as the safe and matches a number on the dice rolled. It can't be cracked until all the tiles in that row and column have been cracked. After cracking a safe you get some loot, which has a penalty to the player while he's carrying it. Additionally, many alarms will only trigger if a player is carrying loot.


I enjoyed the game a lot. It's different than a lot of co-ops which just build up the tension by throwing a ton of random bad stuff at you (or as another player called it, whack-a-mole). And figuring out how to navigate the maze while avoiding the guard is fun. I like the artwork on the tiles, but not on the character cards. Most of the game works really well.

There are a few rough patches with the game though, most notably the event cards. Almost none of the event cards are just outright good for you. Some of them could potentially be good given the right situation, but as they trigger immediately and you generally won't know what they are, they're as likely to screw you as help you. And most of them are just outright bad for you. To make event cards even worse, while most actions require a single action point, event cards require two action points to acquire. I really don't see the point of event cards. The only time they might be worthwhile is if you have a way to see what they are, or if you're definitely losing the game and are willing to gamble on some random event being beneficial.

Overall the game was a lot of fun and I'd be happy to play again. It might have been a little long with four though.

Played solo and three players so far.  Enjoyed both.  Game will not appeal to some because it's heavy on luck.  Random cards determine the path of the guard.  Random tiles are placed for room contents and random dice rolls determine if you break into the safe.  Random loot cards can also hinder escape.  If your game group is OK with constant changes of plans and lots of unknowns, they will love this!  The theme is cleverly woven throughout.  The threat of getting caught keeps increasing as the game goes on, resulting in just the right amount of tension.  Like many cooperative games, this one suffers from the possibility of controlling players wanting to ensure a victory for the team, so be careful to let all players attempt to offer up to their teammates their own strategy before another chimes in with a better plan!

Hugely thematic little game with streamlined rules and very nice production values; some companies would have gone with cards for the rooms which would have ruined the experience (shifting around when touched), so glad Tim went with thick cardboard tiles.

Very nice co-op. The central puzzle is movement and pathfinding. Can teach enough to get started within a couple of minutes, then the rules are quite intuitive from there. Plays reasonably quickly and manages to seem more difficult than it actually is so works as a gateway to co-ops.  Lots of small random elements make each game feel different, yet the randomness is relatively controllable for a co-op so you never feel like the game just did you over.

Co-ops as a general rule don't excite me, so maybe take my opinion with that in mind, but found the game a bit dull.  Neat idea, feel like I should give it more credit because I liked the concept and execution more than other heralded games like Forbidden Island/Desert and Pandemic, but I still just find myself bored.  Tried to entertain myself by barging through halls, but most of the rooms aren't all that exciting either.

Really enjoying this one. Slightly tedious set-up, but worth it. We've played the intro game and beat it handily, but have lost the Bank Job twice now: once due to rules misunderstandings, and once due to being idiots.

One of the funniest boardgames I've ever played ( https://boardgamegeek.com/blogpost/59420/humor-games-please-dont-kill-frog )

It can be frustrating when you have to waste a turn not moving because of guards, but the excitement of drawing an event card usually makes up for this.

Initial rating may be high, future plays (or lack thereof) will tell. I'm not sure this is a Pandemic killer for us, but it's *fresh*

Very good, innovative, challenging, heist themed, co-op puzzle game. Fun detail with loot, which will hinder your further progress - such as a Persian Kitty which will randomly run away towards the alarms/guards and you MUST get it back; or a chihuahua which will randomly bark attracting the guards; and a tiara which you will of course have to wear on your head making you visible to passing guards.

Not at all just yet another Pandemic rethemed as firemen, police, aliens, ghosts, dragons or wizards or some bullshit and with more crap added onto it.

RATING: 9
Simply great! A great solo game that gets harder when played with more players. With so many characters (each one with two sides with a different ability), layouts for the rooms that can be built and wall positions the replayability is just infinite! The game is really fun as you don't know what to expect. The only disadvantage is in my opinion the small number of loot cards and equipment cards, but I think that an expansion will fix this problem. An 8.5 at first but I think that it will get for sure at 9. If you find it, buy it!

Edit: 9 it is!

Burgle Bros. is a 60's heist movie in cardboard form. Players try to break into a high rise, Mission Impossible style and then crack three safes before escaping to the roof to make their getaway. There are of course, a handful of guards constantly patrolling the premises, which players must avoid at all costs. The trick is that each safe that is cracked puts the guards on higher alert, making them patrol more quickly and with greater thoroughness. Each burglar has three stealth points, and each time they are caught they burn one of them. If anyone is caught without a stealth point to burn, the game ends in defeat...as the collared criminal spills the beans on the whole gang.

The game itself is super clever. The AI system of the guards is simple, yet manages to put the players in constant danger. The guards can be manipulated however, as players will often find themselves intentionally setting off alarms to draw guards away from endangered players. While this allows players to game the system a little bit, it still feels right, as an elite squad of professional thieves should be able to manipulate the guards, just like they do in the movies.

The best thing about the game though, is the stuff you steal. It's all extremely silly, but the treasures all make escaping the building even harder. One treasure is actually a cat and every turn that cat will have a tendency to run away. This is of course a problem if the cat knows and loves the guards and makes a dash right to them. Again, it is completely silly...but charming and ridiculously fun all the same.

really enjoy stories, movies, and books about heists and figured a game would be interesting as well, and a cooperative one that channels Ocean’s Eleven really started checking all of the boxes. I was originally a backer on the Kickstarter project for Burgle Bros, but pulled out for some reason. Later I decided to buy it and got it directly from Fowler Games.

In Burgle Bros you start on the ground floor of a three level building and your goal is to find and crack the three safes, one per floor, and then escape to the roof. You’ll do this by spending actions to peak at neighboring tiles, move around (potentially blindly), and crack the safe. Every player has some special ability or talent that helps them do something better than the other players.

Meanwhile, each floor has a guard and they get progressively faster from floor to floor. If any one player is caught four times, game over. The guards move around according to a shuffled deck of cards, so their patterns are somewhat predictable, but if you trip an alarm, they make a bee line for that tile.

My favorite part of the game are the loot cards. After you crack a safe you receive one tool and one loot card. You must have three loot cards to win, otherwise it’s a loss. However, each loot card has a minor negative effect that’s usually pretty funny. Pick up the bust and you can’t use tools since you’re carrying this large statue. Steal the Persian kitty and it starts wandering close to the rooms that have alarms. Acquire the tiara and guards can see you from neighboring tiles.

Most cooperative games have a shelf life due to the nature of the games. You start winning enough and you’ve mastered it, time to move on. I have no doubts that Burgle Bros suffers from that exact problem, but in the meanwhile I have a beautifully produced game about a heist, something I haven’t seen before.

Recommended.

I'm not a big fan of coops, but this game does it right. Sure, there's a lot of luck involved and most of the decisions you'll make as a team are fairly obvious, but because the theme fits the game mechanics so well, I still have a blast playing this heist game that's packed with excitement. I'll take this one over Forbidden Island any day.

Coop robbery action point allowance game to break into safes located on each floor of a highly secure commercial building. Variable power characters explore the random modular office tiles laid in a A1 to D6 grid. Wall pieces are placed in a pattern that restrict movement between room tiles. Guards travel rounds on each floor with a simple yet effective bingo style card drawing AI mechanic. Setting off alarms makes the guard come rushing. Burglars spend limited stealth tokens to avoid detection when guards get too close. Has a similar play feel to Forbidden Desert. Finding the safe determines the row/column room tile coordinates for getting the combination to open the safe. Gateway game that has some fun moments.

This is a tight and thematic co-op, with some inventive and fun mechanics.  It is tough to beat, and gives the incredible feeling of breaking into a building and finding treasures and trouble inside.  The rules are well put together and we hardly found anything uncovered.  All the pieces fit into the pleasingly small box.  It takes one game to get the idea, and then you'll do ok.  Worth a few visits at least.

This was SO FUN. Really captured the feeling of a heist movie and fun of genuine tension and surprises. I loved being able to "trick" the guard (even though he got us in the end!), and there were moments that felt very immersive (like my husband asking me if I "wanted to take the dynamite" before leaving the room we were both in to go hunting for the safe). Really glad this went down well - it felt a lot more interactive than Pandemic, where the game almost seemed to be running itself. Absolutely cannot wait to play this again.

Oh man, what a great game! I would have been happy with just the print 'n play version. It's just really solid gameplay that keeps you on your toes. In our first game, it was super tense near the end. The Safe happened to come up right one room away from the exit stairs, but also right the guard's path for two turns, so that was two turns we had to not be near him, but not wander off too far and waste time coming back. There was also a motion sensor between the safe and the stairs which slowed things down immensely, and had us prioritizing our actions as a group. A key strategy is to leave the current floor to prevent a guard from moving, and it saved our bacon at least twice.
The base missions in the rule book are nice, but the fact that the rule book even includes a link to a website that generates floor layouts with the click of a button (and saves them for later) is brilliant. Infinite replayability. Now, if only I hadn't cut my Peterman in half...

Érdekes volt. Alapból nagyon tetszenek a koop játékok, itt pedig a körítés és a hangulat, valamint a stílus is megvolt a szórakozáshoz. Ennek ellenére megosztó a konklúzió, hiszen nagyon szívesen kipróbálnám, h milyen érzés lehet megnyerni egy pályát, a gyakorlatban viszont ennek minimális esélyét látom. 4-en próbáltuk, azóta már kiderült, h lehet nem ez az optimális létszám, de akkor meg nem jó a játék, ha így szinte teljesen esélytelen vagy. Nem baj, ha nehéz a Burgle Bros, de rutinos játékosokként 2 meccs alatt a közelébe sem kerültünk a győzelemnek, így lehangoló volt a végeredmény többeknek. Én szívesen próbálkozom még majd vele, de nem tudom, ezek után elő fog-e még kerülni.

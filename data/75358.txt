RATING: 7
A stock game where route building is just about ancillary... For a game that lasts a little over 30 minutes, it's an impressive design; what do I think my opponents are doing and how can I position my portfolio to properly leach off of that. I've heard it said that it's a game which has a paradox; the game simultaneously is deeper than expected, and too shallow. Understanding other player incentives about what routes they want to further and working with them (or against) and what they think you're going to do and all is central to the game. Conversely, it's shares and bits of track that just sort of pops out. The setup is by far the most damning element of the game; it's a good 5min if you don't have a lot of help to setup for a game that barely takes 30-40min. I think if players played a couple games back to back, it wouldn't be so bad (especially since you'll see a meta evolve when the same group does), but that rarely seems to happen. Higher player counts favor defensive posturing (as you have less control over the game state comparatively) and more shared alliances. Lower counts favor player positioning and more offensive risks mixed in with normal play. Excellent intro econ game and general filler, but fantastic with players who understand how to only casually advance the game state (and broadcasted information) via sub-optimized play.

Game improves if you threaten in lots of places at once; keep an option open to get close to Marseille, it short circuits some players analysis because it causes the game duration calculation to become much more murky. About 15% of my games actually get there and end before running out of colors, maybe half don't even come close. That's ok too. I've played enough games to see a winning score of $37 and a losing (2nd place) score of $259...

Also, this is one instance where I agree with JCL (I think it was JCL at any rate); keep received shares from trades in the open/front; it improves the game, especially with new players but also in general.

edit: 40 games in, it has staying power, but I find I now do stupid/strange stuff sometimes just to see what happens fwiw...

RATING: 7
Really abstract train game.  interesting balance of trading cubes for cubes (as stock), and using the same cubes to lay track.  There is also some "screw you" where you can pick up a bunch of cubes and waste them to prevent someone else from connecting to the valuable cities.  I'd have to play again to really "get it", if that ever happened.

Pretty solid stock game, not sure if it's as great as Acquire, but we've enjoyed it the two times we've played. Felt different at both player counts (4 and 6), would like to try it with odd number of players. 

The basic mechanic is simple -- you're trying to lay down trains and increase lines (making them more valuable) while simultaneously buying stock in the lines you think will succeed and trying to torpedo the lines you don't own stock in. I think my favorite part of this game is the ingenious mechanic that merges the track/stock of each line (they're both little train-eeples) so that laying track also reduces the amount of stock available to your opponents to buy. 

Update: I ended up selling this one because I was disheartened at a game that took 15 minutes to set up and 20 to play. Also, it was tough to smell out a strategy in such a short time, so we ended up playing a lightweight game more like a longer bluffing game, and it ended up being a weird mashup of genres that no one in the group really liked.

LIKE: Good decisions, plenty of room for free-form strategy. Good deduction + route building game. It was fun trying to figure out what another player was doing and then see if I could grab/dump some shares before they do it. I highly enjoy that if an opponent dumps stocks, it won't tank your position.

DISLIKE: Very fiddly setup, but if everyone helps it goes by quicker. Can suffer from mean moves.

OVERALL: This game went over well with people who wanted something with depth, but quick. I felt like I was trying to deduct who was going for what, then how much was left to build a good route. Solid game.

RATING: 6
Railway building and stock speculation in a family friendly package. Many people claim that the experience will be highly dependent on the group dynamics,
and I might agree with this. For example, if players choose to rush one railway to Marseille, Paris Connection can be a super fast game in which you barely get to do anything. This is especially true for 5-6 player games.

I do not have enough games with different groups under my belt to say anything for sure, but my gut feeling is that your future will most likely be decided in the initial draw of stocks. But this works in the opposite way than you may first think. Ideally you want to get stocks for companies nobody starts to build so that you can trade them away in exchange for the more valuable ones. If you start the game with stocks that quickly increase in value you find yourself in a kind of dead-end. If you wanted to increase the number of stocks in your possession you would have to trade the valuable ones to bad ones, and this will guarantee that someone else will snatch that expensive one from the market before you have a chance to reclaim it.

However, this may well be a wrong observation. Anyways, the game plays fast and is easy to teach which makes it a valid choice for a sub-hour game.

Winsome games appeal for their simplicitiy and ease of seeing the map, I liked SNCF and it works well as a quick game for players who like this sort of game, played with deliberate players who try to optimise a move that can't possibly be optimized because the companies are too dynamic makes for a long, dull game.

1st plays: Extremely fast share economic interest game, along the lines of Chicago Express but much lighter.  We played two games in rapid succession and the second play felt very different from the first.  The decision of whether to take shares or to lay track will be very group-think dependent.  I'm curious to see whether and how the game changes in the next play.

2nd play: Much better with 3, there's enough control over the train companies that you can trade for shares in, and there's a psychological game of trying to guess which companies people are investing in and then tanking their company, or the other way around.  Interesting and fast, worth a try when you have 30 minutes to play a game.

Paris Connection is a clever distillation of share buying and network building games down to the barest minimum.  A key part of that distillation is that a company's trains are used both to grow its network and to represent shares.  An initial random deal of trains as shares is hidden behind a screen and so there is uncertainty about who owns how much of each company.  You can go nuts trying to second guess your opponents or you can simply try to build some networks, buying shares in those that seem to have the highest potential.  Estimating a company's ultimate value is rendered hit and miss by trading in shares and by helpful opponents extending a line into empty space. It's that level of chaos that bothers me.  Better stock games allow more reliable estimation of a share's potential and greater control over whether it is achieved. 

It's not the prettiest board, although I do like the railway line stock track.  I find the little trains fiddly and for once yearn for the simplicity of Winsome's cubes.  The big box was unnecessary.  The ultra-brief rules are clearly written.

A pleasant, "train route" laying game set in France that simplifies the mechanics in standard train route games and plays fast. This train game includes the requisite: "train stock" price manipulation coupled with investing in certain trains.  For me, it lacks a certain "yes!" factor, or design magic, which I sense a bit more in Trans America and Ticket to Ride.  All in all, a respectable train game, right on the border of a 6 and a 7 for me, but going to give it a 7 because I am willing to play it again to see if there is more to it than I sensed on the first two plays.

Further play:  Seemed to play better with five players than with three.

This is a wonderful game.  It's quick and yet full of interesting decisions.  Requires hidden information to work, as in some sense the whole game is about hiding your (initial) cubes from the other players, or actively misleading them about what they are.

I worry a bit that if you get a bad initial draw (i.e. a balanced set) then you're doomed to mediocrity, but I will have to play it a few more times to see if this is true.  In any case, it's barely 30 minutes long, so the randomness isn't a deal-breaker.

As of October, it's my favourite game of the year.  [As I write this, however, I haven't played many of the other Essen 2010 releases.]  I hope someone like Queen picks it up so that it gets the distribution it deserves.

RATING: 7
If I were giving out a spartan award, I think this game would get it: minimal production, rules, and playtime for an actual game experience.  Everybody starts with random cubes, part of a group of public cubes for each train.  On your turn, you can either trade in a private cube for 1-2 of the public ones (acquire shares) or use the public ones to extend a line (and increase or sabotage its value).  Over in maybe 15 minutes, with an actual narrative.  Kinda cool.  I'd rather play that newly-acquired shares are public, not hidden.  Queen edition looks like it might add value with easier value/remainder counting.  Update: did play the Queen edition, and I think the production definitely helped in terms of game visualization.  I think it's overpriced, but totally recommend trying it.

18xx (very) light. I am sorry but, in our game at least, it was as simple as the person who collected the most shares won. It shouldn't have been like that, clever share selection should have counted for more. Yes, you can hold a maximum of 10 shares and after a few plays I would expect everyone would have their full quota at the end of each game, but still, if this was supposed to be a gateway to train gaming it fell flat. It felt like the concept was too complex to explain to a non-gamer but there is not enough there for anybody with a modicum of gaming experience. Wont be rushing to play again.

Fantastically clever and simple set of mechanisms which allows you to fit a solid train game with shares etc into a half hour. I can see how much fun this game will be with 5 of 6, but for 3 it just doesn't work. It is too obvious who has what shares and a couple of companies were left unused, forcing a concentration on 3 or 4. In the end, the win was shared with the third player only one point behind. Won't play again with 3 but looking forward to trying this with more.

This was an interesting little game that I quite enjoyed. When our friend pulled it out I was dubious, because we'd just played one long train game, and I didn't want to go straight into another. But Paris Connection plays quick, is easy to grasp, and it's not really super in depth of difficult. I could see people who've played it often being far more competitive with it. I'd play it again for sure.

An excellent 30 - 45 minute filler.  Lots of tense decisions and interplay dynamics for a game that ends by the time most other games are finished explaining rules.

I love traffic lights, I love traffic lights, I love traffic lights, but only when they're green.

This is a tough one to rate.  I can't decide whether there is little strategy at all (never place trains -- just buy whatever's most expensive -- pretty much what I did to win our first game), or if there is in fact subtle yet important strategy.   Perhaps further plays will help decide.    

I do like its quick play time and the components.

The game seemed kind of dumb and simplistic out of the gate, but you quickly realize what a cool dynamic is created by the trains being both shares of stock AND trains that are placed on the board to make the stock value go up!

If people have a lot of shares in a company, there aren't enough trains left to make those shares worthwhile.  Conversely, if there aren't many shares issued in a company, no one has any interest in expanding it.

Overall, a super simple game with surprisingly tense game play.

This was a game I could tell I was going to enjoy but it has a depth that it was a game I REALLY enjoyed. It's abstract, through and through, but I am glad there is a little theme pasted on there. Each game played so differently, with us all trying different strategies each different play. It's my kind of game, and I think I want to own it soon and play it with family. It takes longer to set the game up than to play it, but even that wasn't too bad. (I love Marvel: Legendary, and that's a pain to build up and put back away). It helped that I won 2 of the 3 games, and only lost the other one by 1 point. It fits me.

Few rules, lots of thinking. The question on each of your turns is whether to increase or modify your portfolio, or increase or decrease in value a stock. It's very simple, but the trade off between the two options is enormous and where all the fun is as it is agonising.

The more recent Mini Rails, I feel, takes the ideas of this, makes it slightly more complex (thus harder to teach, but remains a simple game), but easier to grasp (good play happens faster), thus negating the need to ever play Paris Connection again for me.

This game is not good. It felt very pointless and you get absolutely no kick out of it! The decisions to make are very basic… However, it’s extremely fast and isn’t brainburning at all, so as a filler when you want to relax with your family, it’s probably ok. The one thing I liked the most was probably that you could take some trains the other players need and lay them without getting any points for them. And the fact that the game can end in two different ways is good. 
But for me as a gamer I don’t care much for it, and if our game had taken 15 minutes longer (in addition to the 20-30 minutes it took), I wouldn’t want to play it again and would probably rate it even lower. As it stands, it’s very short, but I feel like it tries to be an actual game and not just a filler – but to me it fails to achieve that. The size of the box is ridiculous for such a simple, short game with minimal components, and the setup time is horrible considering it's such a short game

[i]Received this after winning the Queen Lancaster Games contest.[/i]

Update: rated 8 after one play. Funny enough, I won this game in the Queen's Lancaster contest, but got a chance to play it before actually receiving my prize. Good news--this is a solid game!

I found a game that officially "fires" Transamerica. Like Transamerica, you're laying down track (trains) to make connections. It plays quick, it's easy to teach, and I suspect it handles a range of player counts.

So why does it fire Transamerica? This has a stock element, probably the most stripped down stock element I've encountered. And, that makes the choices far more interesting. Those little trains serve two purposes--create routes, or select them to boost your investment. You choose one on a turn, so turns happen quickly.

A 20 minute gateway stock game that can handle a range of players and that's easy to teach? Sign me up.

Very simple stock game of placing trains on the board to extend routes and score points or trading 1 train for 2 trains to increase the number of shares you own of them. It's a big box filler that plays lightning quick. There's not much to it at all, but it is definitely a filler stock game that just works well. If there were more maps I'd consider picking it up, but just 1 map makes it a tough sell. Happy to play this one still if someone brings it to game night.

RATING: 6.5
Impressive.  Frequently described as a light filler, but I don't buy it.  There's a lot to think about here and the decisions, while seemingly small, have well textured implications.

At heart this is a deduction game in which the players iteratively specialise their investments, attempting in the process to tempt the other players to collusive actions that are both for and against their own interests (tempo management and right/left binding are key).  SNCF is not really a temporary emergent alliances game, but rather one of incremental revelation and commitment while attempting to manipulate the other player's deductive processes to your favour.

Blowing out the above a little:

[i]I normally describe SNCF as a deduction game, but with the difference being that what the players are attempting to deduce is not the other player's game states, but is rather the state of the other players' deductive models of the other players and how you can manipulate the other players' cognitive processes, using nothing but the game's methods, toward personal victory.

Blinking quickly before diving into the rabbit hole: while playing you are trying to figure out what BubbaPlayer thinks about what all the other players are thinking what all the other players are thinking etc etc etc about the game...and not only that, and not just the cognitive flaws in that endless recursion as each player overlooks some important detail and that echoes around the loops of understanding across the players, but also the methods that BubbaPlayer is using to construct both his understanding and his understanding of the methods the other players are using to construct their understandings. And of course you're doing that for all the the players as each and every turn changes their models and their methods etc...and you're trying to inject data into the system via your actions which leads that great heady cloud to collapse in your favour.[/i]

Update:  I think about this game constantly.  If it survives the next barrage of plays intact this is a 9.5 or 10.

Update:  After more plays it appears this game is different from the game I thought it was.  More investigation needed to find out if this game is either brilliant or broken.

Man, this one has grabbed me with it's smooth and deep gameplay.  What really attracts me to the game is how it play's out so differently depending on how the rest of the group decides they want to play it.  This is one of those shared incentive games that just does it right.  Low overhead, good production values, engaging play.  The one negative is the setup, which I hate to mention since I think the criticism is overblown.

I've come to really enjoy games where you control the end game timer to apply some pressures to the system.  Are you behind, you better help make sure those that are ahead do not have enough trains to make it to Marseilles.

Interesting mechanics: stock trading and betting game

Similar to other games: Any game where you are betting on the color/faction of who is going to win. Lemming Mafia, Abandon Ship, etc but this has a little more strategy to it.

General thoughts:  I think it's overpriced because if you are playing with someone who just wants to end the game quickly it can be over in 10 min or less. The mechanics only work if everyone is playing to win. It's fun but it's way to easy to play king maker in this one.

This is a brilliant design. It seems so simple, but there are delightfully interesting decisions. 

Its important to get to your maximum shares. But you also have to manage your hidden information carefully as you begin revealing shares.  If you don't pay attention to other players' decisions, you may fail to deduce what shares they are more heavily (secretly) invested in.

The Winsome production is pretty shoddy. I'm looking forward to the deluxe treatment that is currently pending (from Queen I think).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
SNCF is a shorter game with a less complex focus that may surprise people who are only familiar with Winsome's heavier offerings. This, instead, offers a shorter, easier to play experience that should always last less than 30 minutes.

The game play is pretty easy to explain: 6 companies. The cubes represent either stocks or track. If you have them behind your player hide they are stocks, but the companies have the rest in their boxes that players can use to build routes. Players, on their turn, can either have a company build routes, which increases the value of the stock for the end game, or they can trade in one stock cube from behind their hide for 1-2 cubes from a single company, increasing their stock holdings. Each player count has a different limit to prevent people from hogging up stock continuously and not building track. The game ends when a certain number of companies run out of track cubes, or a final destination city is built into. Stock value is then totaled, highest score wins.

Again, this is a very straight forward game. It serves as a workable diversion if you have a bit of time to kill before someone else shows up for the session or even as a light closer. I don't think it has the real variability or heft to rate highly for me (as lighter games tend to interest me less, so I want to play them less often), but it has a clever central idea. That said, I'm apathetic about ever playing it again. Wouldn't refuse, but would never request either. Textbook 5.

I [i]guess[/i] it's better than TransAmerica? Only played twice so far, both times with 6 players. Control seems to be vanishingly thin. There aren't a lot of shortish 6 player games, so this is a keeper. But based on what I had heard, I somehow expected something... more.

Now this is a game I would love to see around more often than I do now: never. It's probably caused by the cutesy appearence which hides the fact that this, like Chicago Express, was once a Winsome game. Regrettably for my wallet I'm slowly inching towards the type of game issued by this company because the [i]game[/i] in those games is usually a lot better than to be found elsewhere. The utter simplicity in the action choices presented to the players in Paris Connection strikes a chord with me too: do more with less. It's been far too long to remember the specific details of the game I played as I write this comment, and reading through the rules I cannot seem to jog my memory either. I'm going out on a limb here, and award a high rate based on how I would like the game were I to replay it. Shame it costs so much and is almost not to be found in the secondary market.

The rules and game play are extremely easy to understand and teach.  The way to win this game is not so easy to understand because it has to do with how other players are playing.  I played this game with large and small number of players and preferred it with three (less).

There is quite a bit of setup required in this game for such a short playing time.  Nice game, great components, but not one that I need to keep in my collection.

Paris Connection takes the concept of "railroad as stock investment" game, and boils it down to its simplest, most essential core.  Calculating is minimized, making Paris Connection ideal for board game newcomers.

[September 2017 - 7.7]
Great introductory game to several mechanisms I enjoy, but it can also be a more thinky and cuthroat game for gamers.

The main thrusts of Paris Connection are route-building and stock-taking, in that players are not a particular color, but investing in the color they think will do best. They can make that investment pay off best in the end by A)Building more lucrative routes and B) Picking up more stock in those routes. Which, by the way, are your only two choices for actions in the game.  

But there's a big catch that makes Paris Connection so devilish ... the stock shares and the track for the routes are the same pieces. In other words, use a piece to build a route longer, and that color/company has less shares to go around. On the flip side, if you buy up a ton of shares, that leaves fewer pieces to extend the track.

That push/pull creates some nice decisions, where the math is pretty easy to run through your head based on the current state of the board, but it ultimately largely depends on guessing what your opponents might do and how many shares they already own of the color. Because, if they have more shares than you, and you're extending that color's track, all you're doing is giving them more victory points. That being said, there's nothing stopping you from building that track ... in loops and clumps across the open fields, effectively wasting that company's track instead of scoring it points in cities.

The stock-taking also has a good mechanism in that you receive two shares for every one share you turn in -- meaning it might be worth giving up a share in the most lucrative company/color to get two shares of a less valuable company as long as it's not less than half below the leading company -- or put another way, two shares at $11 are better than one at $20. There's a limit you can do this -- eg. you can't just buy shares the whole game -- but it's a great check as it spurs people to invest in other lines.

Finally, there's the area control aspect of the game, where you can block opponents, claim the cities before they do, or as mentioned above, send their tracks an opposite, non-lucrative way.

There's no money, fluctuating market prices, company-control benefits, dividends or resource-collecting in Paris Connection, but here the subtraction of all that is what makes the game so simple and approachable. Then ... learning how to manipulate the track, shares, and routes is where this game gets a little more thinky to keep my attention.

All this being said, for this type of game, I like Through a Desert a little more. Games of Paris Connection, can start to feel samey, depending on how people play, and we've had a tendency to bunch up all the companies/colors around the same stock price and then it's just a matter of who got more overall shares.

Still, it's a great game to teach folks the stock-taking and route-building mechanics. How they play the first time, will be drastically different by the fifth time with those beginner 'ah-ha' moments.

Great filler material, a bit too long setup though. I'm a bit unsure about the instant ending as well, feels like it's better to go first? After more plays I see that who starts doesn't matter at all. Rating upped.

The game itself is a good balance of building and taking shares, but as it's the same components used for both the more shares you take the less you can build.

RATING: 5
Pretty light rail game consisting of standard stuff but condensed components.  6 Railroad companies.  Build 1-5 railways. Railway stock value increases when building into cities. Other than building you could increase your stock holdings by trading in one color for 2 others. Game winner is the sum of all your stock-holdings * stock-value.

Would be happy to play again, but this game has low "wow" factor.

Dropping down to a 5.  I'm not sure there is much game in this one.

RATING: 7
SNCF is one of the three games released in this year’s Winsome Essen Set. Set in France, the theme, as is frequently the case in Winsome games, is about developing the railroad infrastructure of a particular region or country. In this case, the theme is largely irrelevant, as the game is essentially an abstract. The game has six different railroads/cube colors that are arranged in a circle around Paris. Each player gets a number of cubes that they hide behind their screen, which are used to represent the stock they have in the railroad. The remaining cubes of those colors are placed into little boxes on the side of the board. Here is where the particularly interesting part comes in, the cubes themselves represent both stock in those companies as well as the company’s track. On a player’s turn they can either lay out from 1 to 5 track cubes in a particular color, or exchange one of the cubes they have for 1 or 2 cubes of a different color that are in a railroad box. So as a player’s invest in a company they simultaneously reduce its potential, and as they divest themselves from those same companies, they also allow those who still have ownership to make the company more valuable. Points are scored based on the quantity and quality of cities that are entered by the railroad. 

[ImageID=770490]

I think this is a pretty fantastic filler, and it is one that we found interesting enough to play three times in one night. The game fun with both 3 and 4, and the tension between decision to expand a railroad vs. expanding and changing the composition of your available shares was also tough. In particular, as a railroad gets more valuable more people will spend actions taking shares. This will decrease the overall maximum value of the railroad (it is unlikely to expand further) while also decreasing the advantage you get in expanding the railroad vs. anyone else. Similarly as you divest yourself of a railroad’s shares you expand the ability of others to increase the overall value of the railroad. So this is truly a game about deltas rather than just giving  you an advantage. Almost every move you take is going to give at least one other person an advantage too, and being able to gauge everyone’s relative position and the risks involved in advancing a railroad is a difficult enough skill that I suspect this game will have a big replay value.

The only concern I really have is about the tightness of the game’s scores. Two of the three games we played had the final scores from first to last be within 10 points. The one that did not was based entirely on the fact that two of us screwed up and let a third person end the game when he had a big share advantage.

I ultimately sold it because I had reached my natural end point of interest in playing the game.

RATING: 7
Players are investors in the SCNF railway in France, trying to steer the six companies to profitable destinations, and hold stock in those companies.  Simple game where players on their turn either expand a company out from Paris by 1 to 5 trains across a hex map of France, or trade in stock in one of those six companies.  Expansion connects up to French cities, which increase the value of those companies by 1 to 4 points.  Trade allows you to hand a stock back in for one or two stock in another company.  Very simple Knizia-esque game that feels like a combination of Through The Desert expansion with the Honeybears divination of your opponents stock holding (which are hidden behind player screens).  Several clever things - the track/stock interchange (uses the same pieces), the stock trade in allows you to juggle your portfolio, and so on.  Large, lavish Queen production, with fiddly train pieces.  Looks great, easy to explain and plays very quickly  This could have been done in a Transamerica sized box.  Overall, nice meaty filler.

RATING: 8
Nice, simple game of growth and stocks. Simple to explain, but with plenty of fun decisions to take.
Each turn, decide whether to expand the networks or trade in one "stock" (a train in the color of one of the networks) for two stocks. Sounds simple? well, there's plenty of space to make several decisions.
Fun, very fast (unless you play with AP prone players, should never last more than 30 minutes) and leaves you with that "ok, fine, let's do this one more time!" feeling.
Love it.

Who knew there was such a thing as Winsome filler?   A quick and easy little cube rail game which shouldn't last more than 30 minutes and might only last 10.  Either lay up to 5 track for any company, or ditch one share for two from another company but there's a penalty for having too many shares.  That's about it.  This should make an excellent gateway game for people who are completely new to the genre, with something like Smarkand or Chicago Express being the next step.   The Queen edition (Paris Connection) is shockingly over-priced at $63 MSRP.   Absolutely appalling price point, even though it is a decent production.

This game is very short; you'll want to play multiple games as though they were rounds. It seems like there's a decent amount of metagame to explore here. The hidden shares keep the perfect information pleasantly at bay. The non-random board seems like it would lead to similar opening moves, but I won't worry about that until it actually happens. I'd welcome playing this with more than 3. With 3 it seemed like some companies didn't have a chance to grow.

After playing with 5, I'm less enthusiastic about larger player counts. It seemed like players had several turns where they couldn't make meaningful moves, instead having to waste time to bring the game to a close. Also, with 5, it seemed like increasing a company's value was a worse idea since so many other players could invest after your turn.

Also, other reviews mentioned fun from bluffing. In our games this hasn't materialized. There are much better games for bluffing if that's what you want.

Camel Up provides similar decisions with a much better climax, and is more flexible with player count.

A great, fast and clever rail game, playing in 20 minutes or so.  It offers really interesting decisions: expand a railway, take shares in a railway, sabotage a rail network you have no interest in, or rush to end the game if you think you are in a winning position.  Of course you never quite know if you are in a winning position as everyone's shares are hidden behind their screen.  And the shares are the same as counters as the trains which expand the network which adds to the interest.

Winsome train/stock game with lovely production values by Queen Games.

Most gamers are always on the look out for an accessible game that they can introduce to their family and friends, and yet offers enough substance to keep it a meaningful and enjoyable experience for themselves. Paris Connection is that game. It's beautiful on the level of components and aesthetics, and features a simple rule-set that can be taught quickly, and a playing-time of around 20 minutes. While somewhat dry and abstract, and even opaque for new players, it features a simple but ingenious stock system that promises a real depth of decisions, that will reward players the more that they explore it. Paris Connection is an excellent design, that can serve double duty as a filler for gamers, or as a gateway game for non-gamers.

I was smitten with this game like a lot of other people. It's a great filler that offers bullying and brutality, and the Queen version components are great. I enjoyed my 5-10 plays but I must say it fizzled out rather quickly for me. I find the setup to be a large deterrent to playing (literally takes almost as long to set up as to play), and now that I've seen the nastiness, it's not a surprise anymore. We go in knowing that we're going to tank the first train someone shows interest in (even if it's a feint). We all know what we're doing now which, surprisingly, makes the game less fun instead of more. It's like we're all going around waiting for someone else to blink. If the game didn't require such an onerous setup, I might find that type of exercise interesting. As it is, the setup is tiresome relative to the sense of exploration. Probably a great iOS game.

SNCF is probably the simplest and shortest train game in existence. Players extend the rail networks of 6 different companies and trade shares in them. Marvelously, all of this happens without the need for any money tokens.

Track tokens also double as shares so the more shares get bought of a company the less track it can built and vice versa. As soon as 5 of the companies run out of track and/or shares or one company connects to Marseille the game ends.

Despite its length (or lack thereof) the game provides a lot to think about in order to find the correct balance between track building and shares and of course the optimal share distribution.

SNCF (aka Paris Connection) is, as I like to refer to it, "the train-gamers' Cribbage." That's not to say that it's in anyway like Cribbage mind you. Instead, it exhibits a high degree of "Cribbage-ness": hidden depth, simple rules, family friendliness, works as a filler between the meatier games, and fiddle-friendly. It's a lovely stock game of shared incentives and emergent (and fleeting) alliances -- a perfect Winsome!

After 1 play with mom and dad, I am thrilled with the possibilities of this game. Within a few turns, they knew what to do, but by the end, I realized there is way more to this than the simple rules make it seem. Even better, mom and dad both enjoyed it, and I've not even tried the usual gateways like Ticket to Ride with them, for fear of it being too much for dad's attention span. 

Very excited to explore this wonderful game more!

Update: after 3 more plays with this game 5 and 6 player, I've realized I really have no idea how to play this game well, despite its incredible simplicity. I think it's the speculation of the stock value that throws me. And when I have a good plan, the game ends sooner than I expect. I think it's pretty crazy that such a simple game (rules wise) is still showing new layers after multiple plays.

A very simple-to-learn stock manipulation game that plays fast.

A Winsome that comes with player screens? Shocking. But they are indeed necessary, as the initial cube draw is hidden. In a way, that first batch of cubes is like a hand of cards. And the game itself plays like a quick card game, only with a spatial element. Playing it brought a smile to my face, its clever cube-as-stock idea being very charming. Timing!

I'll wager that this gets picked up for licensing by Queen. It's super simple, super fast, and it's set in France. A surefire hit.

Update: After a dozen plays or so, the brilliance of SNCF comes through even clearer. Upped the rating. Must be played that all newly acquired shares be placed in front of screen as open information.

-- Final Update: After playing Spectaculum, Paris Connection is by far the less enjoyable game. Rating dropped accordingly. Paris Connection is less enjoyable because it's mostly a game of guessing and reading other people, which I hate in games. Spectaculum's open stock holdings and random setup make it a game about analyzing the board and deciding what to invest in, which is much more fun.

-- Update: I've come to like it quite a bit. It is not a good game for non-gamers as some have said. The strategy, and what's going on, is too opaque. It takes a few plays for everyone to get a handle on how to evaluate the companies and board.

Completely stripped-down game of getting stock in different train companies, while simultaneously trying to make those companies more valuable by building out to cities. Rules fit onto one page front-and-back, so it really is simple. 

The play experience seems to depend on the mood of the players quite a bit. If a couple of players make a run to end the game in Marseille without understanding why, the game feels stunted and random. But it can also feel heavier and more tactical as you try to maximize your holdings.

A good little game but suffers from two problems. First, as people get better at it, the game becomes more and more boring because (second) this game suffers massively from the problem of the commons. Still a good quick little game but my opinion of it drops the more I play.

Played the new german expansion map and it isn't as good as the original. At first it looked kind of interesting but it is not nearly as smooth. Overall I'm quite bored of this one. Low replayability but people in my circle seem to like it.

There's an almost meditative quality to the rhythm of SNCF which I only get from the very best abstract games.  Like many great abstracts, the entirety of the challenge comes from the players rather than the system.  The sparse rules add to the game play.  

Feels like the Dixit of train games, where interpreting the creative reasoning between the players forms the game itself.  The impressionist painting from the Winsome edition was a perfect match for this game.  I can't recommend this game highly enough.

Essentially the same game as Chicago Express.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This game is at least as accessible as Ticket to Ride in terms of how easily new players (even non-gamers) can sit down and start having fun with it.  But it has a depth that Ticket to Ride (and every other game I've played with similar accessibility) can't hope to match.  Scales perfectly from 3-6 players.  People complain about the price, but it's only marginally more than Ticket to Ride, and has comparable components and far more profound gameplay.  Belongs in most everyone's collection.

It might fall flat in some groups, because the game is all about seeing through and even manipulating the groupthink at the table.  Groups that don't see that this is central to the game can easily groupthink themselves into a rut, or dismiss the game as being kind of a random mess.  When approached with the right attitude, the game offers deep strategy, and huge replayability, in a surprisingly short play time.  If this has fallen flat in your group, I urge you to try it again, with perceiving the groupthink foremost in your mind.

A quick filler filled with interesting decisions. At first the actions seem obvious but after a few games you start to see the nuances. Like it best with 4 (haven't tried 5 or 6 yet) and with gamers, because despite being a filler it's much more deeper than, say, Ticket to Ride. Setup is a little bit tedious but manageable when everyone participates in the process. (12.12.16)

I can't think of any other game that would be so ideal for introducing stock market games (i.e., you invest in multiple colours rather than playing a colour). It's a straightforward game with a simple rule set and clear objectives that produces interesting collaborations, collusions, and conflicts, even within a first play. While I might not seek this one out for myself, I can certainly appreciate how clean the design is.

RATING: 7
A solid little game with lots of player interaction, that plays quickly and easily. Not a huge amount of specifically train flavor, but an interesting little economic game.

Basically it revolves around investing in companies by acquiring cubes, at the same time as you increase the companies' value by laying the same cubes. So, do you build and let others reap the profits, or do you invest, and hope the value comes up after?

The action of investing allows you to 'buy' two cubes (of different color) for one cube 'sold' (returned to stock). So sometimes you may want to make the decision to return what is/will be a good investment to make it a better one.

Interesting mechanics for a simple game. Rating it conservatively as a 7 on 2 solo plays (3, 4 players)

The Queen edition is beautiful, the nicest addition might be the Gates, which track the number of trains/cubes available more easily than the smaller gridded blocks provided in the original, and also in the Railway Value tracker which shows the relative stock values more clearly.  Mostly the differences lie in the artwork- the game is the same quality, quick enjoyable game it was, and the new packaging is very attractive (though the Queen box is rally a bit oversized for the contents.)

Raising Paris Connection +0.25 for great art.

RATING: 5
It took 10 minutes to explain a game that takes 15 minutes to play. Very simplistic stock market/rail building mechanic. It would be better suited as an abstract than trying to pretend it is a train game. I suppose it could be fun, but when another player took cubes to "my" railroad and dispersed them randomly, so that I could no longer extend links to other cities to score more points, that did the game in for me. We then spent the next 5 minutes doing the same exact thing to make sure the other companies could no longer score, and trying to end the game quickly. I'm not feeling the love. Meh. It's a '5'.

Update (10/01/11): So, SNCF has been repackaged as Paris Connection? And you're going to charge me $63 MSRP ($40 online) for this?!?! If the gameplay remains as simplistic as it was in SNCF, it's not even worth $10. This is criminal.

Feeling lost after the first game is a pretty standard state of affairs for a Winsome game, and this is no exception.  Even though it may be the simplest I've played rules wise (or maybe because of it), I think this might be the most opaque game I've ever played.  Right now Paris Connection feels like an Erector Set of a game - I'm sure that those skilled in the art can create something beautiful out of it, but right now I'm just slapping pieces together to create a big ol' jumble.

Comments:
Ranks up with "For Sale" as one of the deepest 20-30 minute fillers I own. You need to try to ride the wave of popular opinion far more than you need to manage your own plans.

Partnerships seem beneficial, but they're tricky to arrange. If you and another player can mind meld to focus on a train and build it to the "good spots", you can make a pretty big jump over your competitors. It's hard to accomplish that though, especially since opening portfolios are hidden.

I'm a little concerned that our early games have almost always gone to whoever invested the most on their turns. I understand that it's a logical move, but I'd like to try and find a way to punish someone who never builds, outside of joining them in over-investing. Until that comes out, this will probably suffer from being a point or two lower than it "should" be.

Oh, and setup/teardown is a pain in the ass. Get your players to join in, and it becomes only annoying.

No sleeves required.

I'm not a big train gamer, and this one confused me a little. I loved how taking the stocks reduced the number of available trains, thereby limiting their maximum value - it added tension to each round and meant the game was effectively a big game of chicken. However, the game just ends so abruptly when one player decides to build to Marseille that it left a sour taste. I'm sure hardened train gamers would enjoy this but it's not for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
IMO this the most elegant version of the "should-I-get-more-stock-or-increase-the-value-of-the-stock-I-already-own?" game. It's a filler in terms of rules complexity and playing time, but simple-but-deep in the best way.

[b]Update:[/b] My take on two common complaints about the game: 

1. Setup time is too long. We're talking about 5 freakin' minutes of setup time, max. I don't know how many times I've put in 15+ minutes of rules teach and setup for the latest new hotness that ends up being "OK." A few minutes of train-sorting is time well spent in comparison.  
 
2. Strategy is opaque. When people say that this game is opaque, I suspect they mean 1 of 2 things: (1) On your turn your choices are build up the stock you already have or get more stock; it's tempting to do the former, but you'll soon discover that the game is about the latter. It shouldn't take more than 1 game to get over this source of opaqueness. (2) Having realized that the key to game is acquiring the right stocks, you need to try to figure out which new stocks you should get. This can be hard ("opaque"), and it really depends on the group, as it involves reading people, trying to deduce their holdings based on their board play, perhaps disguising your own intentions or bluffing -- in short, groupthink, playing the players, not just being efficient as in so many games.

I'm not sure how to sum up my feelings on this game except to say that I want to play more. Interesting, fast cube-rail game with a King of Siam-like dynamic of increased investment in weakened entities. I dislike how close my endgame scores tend to be, but given the time investment and the fact that I haven't seen anything approaching a tie yet, perhaps I should let that objection slide. Use a stack of poker chips for each railroad to denote their current share value.

RATING: 7
Setup is a bit finicky but the game is solidly designed with strategy which at first seems simple, then with game play becomes less obvious and more difficult. This is a calculation style game with little to no luck involved. I myself prefer a bit of randomness and therefore some cards might have been a nice addition, but if you stock price manipulation games you are likely to enjoy Paris Connection and the board and playing bits are nice.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Paris Connection is quick to teach (it probably takes longer to setup than explain); for a game of its simplicity, it provides some fairly agonizing decisions (chiefly whether to help increase the value of any given railroad company by building or to hog that company's locomotives for a higher end-game score). It can be a bit repetitive, but it's a solid choice for a quick, accessible game for fans of games involving stock manipulation (especially for those who dislike the math-heavy nature of those games).

Tons of playing the other players (rather than solving an optimisation problem), trying to figure out the game state, while also trying to figure out and manipulate what /they/ think the game state is.

Simple rules, quick playing, and a lot of fun. 

It's not mega-deep but there is strategy there - do you want to piggyback on the others' work, or carve out your own railroad? Can you shaft the others by burning their track into valueless countryside, or will they do that to you? Do you rush for Marseille to end it quickly if you think you can stay ahead, or do you want to burn red/black to stop others doing so? Your intial draw is likely to shape this to some extent.

In contrast to the spartan Winsome presentation, the Queen edition is colourful, and insert-lovers rejoice: it has the sturdiest box insert I've ever seen!  (I do like the murky cover art on the Winsome edition though),

RATING: 8
My rating is based on one play (with 4) and is very tentative.  There appear to be some optimum strategies that preclude repeat plays, but I will have to see how the game unfolds with more players.

Based on my initial impression, I think that it would play better with more hidden trains, but there does seem to be a good balance with the numbers provided in the rules.

A couple of additional plays let me bump my rating to an 8.  There's a lot more going on here than it appears...

It's one of those games where you finish it up and you want to just start up and play again.  A really great stock market game with a pasted on train theme which really captures me.

So that's how filler games for hardcore gamers produced by Winsome look like. After reading the rules I wondered if SNCF will work. After playing it for the first time I'm still wondering if it works. Do I have to think about incentive structures for temporary alliances as the Winsome addicts proclaimed for Chicago Express? Do I have to do an investment appraisal before my decision? Or is it enough to let the belly decide? End results within 5% of each other indicate a game of creating gradual advantages but are the available choices fine-grained enough? The only sure thing about SNCF is that it gives food for thought which is more than fillers usually can claim.

I wouldn't consider this necessarily as a gateway game at all. It's setup heavy and you don't have player colours which might be confusing. Having said that I consider PC to be a quick and easy to learn stock collection game that might take two different ways to progress: either somebody reaches Marseille really quickly and game ends abruptly and nothing has really happened, or you can block the first scenario from happening. Then the game might get interesting and trading changes loyalties towards the end. Map looks good and the trains are neat.

Great intro stock game, fast playing and simple to learn but with a good amount of depth. Very low luck (only in the random setup). Love that it plays so fast even with 6 players.

A nice filler+ game (about 30 minutes) that still plays really well at the higher player counts, 6 players works well which is a rare thing. Really tough decisions for a game where you only have two possible actions: expand a railroad (increase or limit the value), or trade in a share of one company and take two shares of another company. The whole game is all about the investment and expansion of companies so you have to watch what other players are doing and predict future values.

A quick simple train game like TransAmerica but SNCF blows it out of the water!  Even though there are only two options on a turn (trade one share for up to two of another company or use up to five cubes to build rail for one company) the decision takes consideration.

Better than average Winsome-traingame. Well, that's not much to said, but this works fine enough, it's fast to play and length is quite optimal. But still... I would choose many many games before this. Paris Connection version is beautiful looking, but the box is ridiculous big compared to what you got. SNCF -edition is ugly looking bastard - but that's just Winsome "standard".

LIKE:

* Excellent filler material in that game is taught and played in 15-20 minutes.
* Cubes can be used to represent either track or shares and you must choose between the two for your action.  
* You can prevent companies from growing in value by wasting 5 track cubes on valueless land.
* If you acquire too much stock, you actually will lose points from having too much!

DISLIKE:

* There is no score track included to keep track of the value of each company.  Will be making one for my game!

Surprisingly deep strategy in a very light game. Often requested by friends. Accommodates new players and seasoned veterans alike. Makes a great filler/starter game or something for when there's not much time. Typical thoughtful play takes 30 minutes. Easy to teach. Few rules.

This is a really light stock and train network game.  You are trying to expand the network of a company to connect cities and increase its value.  

It was OK.  There are other old Winsome games that I like much better like Baltimore and Ohio and Chicago Express.  But this is effectively a filler game.

A Winsome game I enjoy?  A train game my wife will play?  A definite must-add to the collection.  

It is an interesting, if streamlined, game of group think and timing, but controlling the ending conditions are not as easy as it might first seem.  The very simple rules pack in a lot of interesting choices.

The tedious sorting of pieces at setup almost is enough to deter play.  I wish there was a shortcut there to bring it back in proportion to play time.

First impression after one 3p and one 4p game.  Excellent abstract game.  Overproduced, but it's nice for an abstract game to have the wooden locomotives, the heavy cardboard, and the friendly graphics.  Setup takes a little long, but if everyone helps is not so bad.  Takedown is fast.  Rules easy to teach, gameplay is great both for gateway and gamers, scales great, and length at 30 minutes makes for a great filler.  The game has enough groupthink, doublethink, deduction, bluffing, timing, spatial elements, and math crunchiness to be very exciting and enjoyable.  The thirty minutes play length compresses a lot of fun.  A game with a learning curve that is fun to revisit to peel the layers of the onion and see how far the strategies can go.

Are you like me and kind of want to like stock games due to their interactive nature, but don't really like heavy games and wish they were shorter and more fun? Then, like me, you've found your match. Paris Connection is ridiculously good design. It's not my favorite game or anything, but it's masterfully streamlined and good for what it is.

2-Player Comment:
* Paris Connection wasn't designed with two in mind. Unofficial 2p variant: You need 1 dice. First remove 15 random trains from game before beginning normal setup (don't peek). Assign number 1-6 to every trainboard. Every third round throw dice and remove 2 trains from that trainboard, increase value of that colour and remove 1 train from each board next to it (if you roll 6, remove 2 from 6, 1 from 5 & 1 etc.). Otherwise follow normal rules. It works decently this way, but 3+ is highly preferred.

simple and quick playing game of building railroads for 6 companies on a map of France.  

each company has a fixed number of colored cubes which are used both to place track on the board, and as stock certificates.

players during their turn may either expand a railroad by placing cubes from the companies holding area, or they may exchange one share they own for one or two shares of another company that has cubes in their holding areas.

company value is determined by the cities that they connect on the map.  

winner is whoever has the greatest value in their stock portfolios at the end of the game.

Another game that only works at specific player count(s).

RATING: 7
Provisional rating after 2 plays.  I enjoyed this game.  The rules are simple and the game is fairly short, but there is some meat here.

SNCF is part of the 2010 Winsome set. This is my first year subscribing to that set. In SNCF there are 6 RR companies consisting of 32 cubes each. Each player starts with a random, hidden draw of X cubes where X depends upon the number of players. Each player's stock is kept secret from the other players. On his/her turn a player can either: a) build 1 - 5 track on the map (by placing an RR's cubes) or b) sell stock then buy stock by returning 1 cube to a RR then taking 1 or 2 cubes from 1 other (different) RR. The game ends with 5 RRs are out of cubes or when 1 RR has built to Marseilles. At the end players score points (Francs) per cube they hold in a RR. The cube's worth is defined by the number of cities to which that RR has connected. Cities on the map are different colors worth points ranging from 1 - 4. The game plays fairly briskly, but there is some meat there, some interesting decisions to chew upon.

Sold on BGG.

Bought the Queen edition as replacement.

RATING: 7
Really great ratio of weight to playtime, in that this feels like a heavier investment game but plays easily in 30 minutes or so.  Easy to teach, easy turn options, compelling decisions.  The only mild criticism is that players often spend most turns manipulating the board and too few turns getting more trains.  I often win simply by maxing out my trains so this is something that needs to be pointed out to new players.  Still, great little game overall.

Update: After several plays, this game has become increasingly disappointing.  It's such a wonderful little economic game, but the major flaw is that the economic aspect of being invested in the best railroads and manipulating those values is completely secondary to simply having more trains.  This has become so obvious to me that I feel the game is almost broken.  So many of the railroads are close enough in value at the end that which ones I have matters far less than how many I have, so the player who took more turns to swap out 1 for 2 will win.  I want to love this game and was so smitten with it early on, but this realization just makes it painful for me to play.

Original and rather group dependent - for a short game it is interesting how the game can end very quickly if the players want it to. Setup is annoying though, not least because the number of cubes taken in the start could be relevant for the opening.

It is interesting how the apparent lightness of the game may make it seem to players as if they are only "randomly" making moves, while good players will almost always beat weaker players anyway. Reminiscent of Transamerica in this respect, even though this feature is probably even more pronounced here.

Like Chicago Express, this is a quick playing trains and stocks game with simple rules. The rules are even simpler in this case as your choices on a turn are to either place trains or trade shares. You can play a game in 30-45 min and while I don't think it has as much depth as Chicago Express, I find it an interesting game and again about manipulating the other players' motivations.

This is currently my favorite game.

For me, it exists at the perfect sweet spot between accessibility and interesting game play.  

Paris Connection boils down the classical heavy train game genre in to its barest elements - stock collection and route bulding.  The use of the trains as both stock and track creates many fascinating decision points. 

Our games have always been fun, required enough thought to be engaging, and wrap up in approximately 30 minutes.  Immediately after playing a game, our group immediately wants to start another.  For a board game in my collection, that is the hallmark of true success.

Calling it a train game is rather stretching the bounds of imagination. 

There is a hex map of France and 6 colors of cubes, each of which represents a rail line extending out from Paris. On your turn you can use cubes of a color to extend that rail line, possibly to valuable locations, or trade a cube of one color for one or two cubes of another color (though if you go over 20 total cubes there's a penalty -- and note that there's no way to back off if you go over 20.) There is a fixed number of each color of cube, so the more cubes players own, the less there are for extending a color and making it more valuable. 

The game ends when 5 of the 6 colors run out, or when one railroad gets all the way to the furthest city. 

There's a bit of bluffing here -- players start with random secret cubes, which give them incentive to make one color better than the others, and on the flip side, when people trade back cubes in a color they have decided not to hold, they are available for building, and can be used to make that color more valuable. 

It's a clever short game.

La mécanique d'achat et de revente d'actions de ligne de chemin de fer est intéressante en soi, mais le jeu est un peu cacophonique. Il semble, selon les membres BBG, être optimal à 4 joueurs. Hors, j'y ai joué mes deux parties à ce nombre de joueurs, et mon feeling me dit que parce que (jusqu'à) 15 placements de trains séparent deux de mes tours de jeu, je n'ai pas vraiment intérêt à porter beaucoup de sérieux et de profondeur à mes analyses et à mes coups...

"Takes longer to set up than to play" is just barely an exaggeration.

It's not really as deep as I thought it might be, but it was as fun as expected. I'm rarely a fan of games with large numbers of players because I prefer to exert more control in my games. But this is deceptively innocuous that it could be a good gateway game. It's nice to see the good Winsome games getting nice treatment from Queen Games, but I wish they had used cubes instead of train-shaped pieces. If you're gonna go with a funny shape, wouldn't a track-shaped piece have been more appropriate?

While I appreciate the Queen production, I find that the wooden trains are a bit small and would've preferred cubes.  If the board is shifted a bit, the bits tend to slide on the board. I found the same issue with Chicago express.  The game itself is pretty interesting.  The length of play is just right since it's a filler.  Otherwise, I'd find the share exchanges to be frustrating over a long period of time.

Fun, light game of trains! This game is something along the lines of TransAmerica or TransEuropa, but with a flair of Airlines Europe added in. The rules are a simple one page. The game components are really top quality and the artwork is beautiful. 

Everyone begins the game with 8 random trains. You have 2 things you can do. You may trade one of your trains for 1 or 2 of one other color or you may build up to 5 trains. When you build trains, that color will advance on the score track. But when you trade trains you can strategically make sets of trains which will act as multipliers to the score of a color. Now...all the while...trains are running out very quickly. Sort of like buying up shares in the companies before they are gone. But also someone will trade a train back in and suddenly a color will become available again. And someone has a chance to make a play they couldn't before...constantly changing strategy.

This game always makes you feel like you don't know what you are doing. You start to do one thing and then you have to change and do another because of what another player has done on their turn. The strategy is ever changing, but the game itself is quick to play and very enjoyable. There's no time to get upset because someone did something you didn't plan on, there's always some modification you can make. Everyone seems to just have a free-for-all at doing what they want to do. Definitely a game similar to others but unique in it's own right.

Too simple to be engaging, too over-produced to be worthy of hard-earned. Either place a colour on the board to increase its share price, or exchange one of your share colours with two of another share colour. Your score at end of game is sum of shares * price. So, put out a colour to the board to get things going at the start, then everyone simply buys that colour. Boring. Or get some more shares in a colour; watch other people follow suit expecting you to soon advance it. Boring. One of the few games I've manipulated towards an early ending, not caring about position, because I couldn't see the point in watching friends play sheeplike. At least it's quick. It's not bad, just ... average.

Based on one play: Fairly simply rules, but there is not much to do. As a train route becomes valuable, you want to collect trains of it, as the trains are also shares. But there is always one best move to do. The only way to get ahead would be to guess and hope your route becomes valuable or simply hope that others grow routes that you can simply get shares into. So many better train games out there.

This light, stock-based train game evoked feelings of Chicago Express, but was much lighter.  Players could either build a color track (either to increase its value or waste its limited trains) or invest in stock.  The game penalized you for having too much stock, so you had to spend some time building.  The game was very swingy, and you can't really tell which stocks will be the best until the end.  I don't really care for stock games; this one is inoffensive.

Really, really enjoyed this one.  An excellent filler. It is lighter than most Winsomes, but enjoyable regardless.  The 30-min play time is great, although set-up is a bit of a PITA.  It's very tactical, but also has some subtleties in the game play.  The expand but reduces shares & vice-versa mechanisms are clever. I liked it better with 3 players than 5 players.  I have only tried it with train-game/Winsome newbies.  Based on the overwhelmingly positive response, it looks to be a good Winsome gateway game.

Extremely simple rules, plays well with all player counts and the only complaint is setup time and that it may be a bit over produced for the game. Probably should have been a 40-50 dollar game.

Very easy to learn (you either place new track cubes on the board or add cubes to your hand), quick to play, I love the map of France -- very nicely done.  It's a simple game to play but I think among equally experienced players that the winning strategy is not always easy to come by. We had a very fun first game and will play again, although I don't know if long-term playability exists.  But, I do like traveling thru France!

Interesting mechanic in this train/stock game. Cubes are used both as track and stock -- you want to pick up cubes the track color that has accumulated the most points... but that leaves fewer cubes for extending the track. Play time is just about right for a game of this weight. (Played SNCF version.)

I bought this game solely cause it was really cheap and it was a big box (bought it at 12) and I needed to surpass $50 to get free shipping on amazon.

Boy is this game fun, it was a surprise when I saw Heavy Cardboard play it, since they always play heavier stuff, but they were playing little thinkier games and saw how they werre teaching it and it was like... a minute to explain everything. YES, IT IS THAT EASY!

Check out that video of Heavy Cardboard and I dare you NOT TO BUY IT.

To a game to be sooo easy but so deep an rich and full of choices and ups and downs it is delightful.

Recommended! 

There's a downside however, everytime you play you have toput the trains into the bag for the blind choice, then rearrange them into the stations, I've been looking for a better way to do it, but don't know how.

1 play and absolutely not convinced. The set-up takes longer then actually playing the game. I think the problem is with the 5 trains as a maximum you can put on the board in 1 turn, this is too much for me and I think 3 would be better. 5 makes that you can reach Marseille in only 4 turns. And if you have a lot of trains in a certain colour, why shouldn't you finsih the game by going to Marseille and increasing the value of your company even more?

RATING: 7
This is a quick filler stockmarket game, where players chose to either put 1-5 wooden trains on the board, or return 1 train from behind their screen to take 2 trains of a different color. At the end of the game, the trains you tucked away are worth whatever the value of that company has gotten to, based on the spaces they were placed on the board. There's some nice push and pull in terms of trying to benefit from other player's actions, and guessing who has what color trains tucked away. The setup is a little annoying for a game of this length, and I'm not sure if I like this better than Steel Driver, but overall, not a bad game.

RATING: 6
Pretty much the ultimate distillation of the trains and stocks system seen in Chicago Express and other Winsome games. There are only about two rules, and it doesn't take much longer to play than it does to set up. The tension that makes the game is that cubes function both as track and as shares, so if a company attracts more investment, it simultaneously loses its potential to expand. That reminds me of the mechanic in the excellent King of Siam, and SNCF is in the same class of very short games with a decent amount to think about. For a quick train fix, I'd take this over Transamerica every time.

Traded because although it's a good game, it suffers from three mismatches in scale:

1. Box size to components - if it was a small box I could throw in the front pocket of my bag, I'd take it to LoB as a closer. Damn Queen Games.

2. Game length to setup time - not so bad if you split it up between players, but still a bit fiddly for less than half an hour of gameplay.

3. Actual depth to apparent depth - I get the impression it would be really good if people got into deducing others' hidden cubes. But mostly it's perceived as a filler and can feel a bit pointless as a result.

Simple stock holding filler but quite exciting to play. Players are either spending their turn gathering shares of a rail company or expanding that rail company. This needs to be balanced as the moment you seem to focus on one colour, others will sabotage that colour. A bit of take that element.

Great, smart and elegant game. Good as warm up or cool down filler. Like the Queen production with train meeples. These are used as track or shares. As you invest as shares less track to build for the line is available. Others noticing that lines are building can climb aboard to get points or squander the resources of the lines.

This has long been my go-to for a game that nicely introduces cross-incentivization, but honestly, it's more than just a Level 1 Train Game; it plays great with people used to heavier, meatier games as well. It's a very small rule book, which is great, because you get up and running quickly. Trains are the only in-game component. When they're on the board, they represent track. When they're in front of you, they represent shares of stock in that colored company. On your turn you may lay 1-5 trains on the board, or you may exchange a train for 1-2 trains of a different color. That's it. The game ends when a train line reaches Marseilles, or when only one company has shares left on its charter. Very simple, very clear, and quite fun. You try to position things so that other people advance your position for you on their turn, and that's a blast when you see it unfolding in front of you and you pull it off. I have only played one game where all I did was trade before ultimately winning, but it was awesome. 

If the Hidden But Trackable Information bugs you, you can play with the initial shares hidden behind your screen, but any newly acquired shares can go outside the screen. 

For the record, if all players pick one color of train and set it up, this game takes roughly three minutes to set up (yes, I've timed it). Claims that it takes as long to set up as it does to play are pure hyperbole. Now if you want to complain about the [i]box size[/i], then be my guest. It's ridiculously oversized. But three minutes of set up for a 25-35 minute game? I'm sorry your highness, but relax. Your time isn't [i]that[/i] precious.

April 2012: Down from 8 to 4. This totally sank in my gaming group, even with a short strategy tips at the beginning warning players of all the fuck you plays and the importance of getting a lot of shares.

January 24, 2012 - Players must recognize the economic consequences of this game or else the game devolves into fuck you plays and the rail map of France will look like The Blob has invaded Paris with no interest in spreading to border towns.

Players have to first invest in stocks and then build rail after. If players do it in the other order (build track then invest), then players who haven't wasted their turns building track will spend it getting stocks, thereby taking advantage of those who built track.

January 20, 2012 - I was expecting more Euro crap with this title but I was pleasantly surprised. The best part of this game is its incredibly short playing time.

Definitely overproduced; why bother sorting all the trains on their on separate boards? Just sort them into piles during the game.

Lots of potential for fuck you plays.

When first learning the game I started to realize how light this game is.  It's surprisingly simple to play.  The rules are very easy.  Just place train meeples to increase the value of the line (color).  Easy.  No strategy....or is there?

As you start to run out of train meeples you begin trading your stock for those color trains to increase your stock value, which leaves more trains of the traded color to place on the board and allows players to increase the values of those trains.  Uh, oh!

You will find yourself in a race to balance the train values as compared to your stock for the last 1/3 of the game.  It's really fun and there is much more depth of strategy that it might appear to have in the beginning.

Well done!

[thing=75358]SCNF (aka Paris Connection)[/thing] is a clever game about optimizing your stock portfolio. Interestingly, the cubes (trains) are used as shares as well as markers used to expand the companies. Trading in a share of X for the more lucrative Y gives X-company another cube (train) to build with and potentially increase its income. Conversely, the more shares you take, the fewer that company will have to expand and increase its income. Fun!

For a seemingly simple game, the strategy is subtle, the game is quite clever and with such a quick playtime (10 - 30 minutes), is a favorite around here with casual gamers and heavy gamers alike.

Not a whole lot going on. I guess I had been expecting a bit more, as I had heard the game involved buying "shares" of railroad companies.

RATING: 5
Interesting as a light game, but as an economic exercise it seems the reverse of reality: 1) players can trade in stock that is presumably worth less (or even worthless) for more valuable stock at a rate of 1:2 and 2) if you purchase stock in a company (presumably giving them more capital) their capacity to build track actually diminishes 3) you can sabotage lines you zero investment in so they run in useless patterns.

Takes longer to set up than play, but it's kind of a chatty event both playing and setting up, so it's not bad. Infinite maps could be created for future versions. Also interesting to entertain the idea of non-random train distribution at the beginning, giving players, for example, all of one color or five of two different colors, and seeing what they do from there. Also seems like the game would alter significantly with more or less players. Interesting.

This is one of the ambiguous category of games which are easy and quick enough to be called fillers, but probably too much of a game to be really one. The rules are plain and simple: buy shares or build train lines, and make the most profit out if it. The trick is that the same pieces that are used as stocks are also use to contruct the railroads, so if the players invest too much in a company they may run out of pieces to build the lines that will increase its value, but if they construct a lot, they may end working for the other players buying shares. This would be a nice gateway game, cause is simple, fast.elegant, fun  and challenging at the same time. Very nice components, as is usual with Queen.

I really like the spot where this game falls: light enough to play with beginners, but deep enough to be far from boring. The simplicity gives it depth, which I value a lot. Do you add value to train lines, or do you obtain shares is the lines that you think will be most valuable?

Also, because I served my LDS mission in Paris, I am a sucker for any theme or setting in France. So this one was kind of set up from the beginning to be a win for me.

Wow, what a surprise.  This is really elegant and plays fast while keeping some good decisions.  The game flows well with attractive companies getting evenly distributed then sold out.  The delta is in the hidden information.  Complete hidden information detracts, but I suggest that bought shares be held in front of your player screen to limit information tracking--not that I could get the other players to buy into that.

3 player seemed about perfect, but 4p wouldn't be bad either.

I've now played both the original SNCF and the new Queen Games version.  The original is great for playing with other gamers.  The Queen version made for a nice gateway for non-gamers.

And all have had the same reaction.  "Hey, that's pretty cool, let's play it again."

The strategy aspect is what seems to hook people in.  Grab one of the three remaining trains of one color and stop them from moving in to Marseille - especially as you deduce the player building furiously has the most of that color.  Take a neglected color and start building, building, building while everyone else focuses on another color.

Not just a light filler, this game as more to it than people first realize.  The simple and concise set-up and rules (1 page each) adds to the enjoyment.

Theoretically, I should like Paris Connection. There is considerable depth to it despite its sleek ruleset. Players want to own the stocks of profitable companies, but possessing said stocks also hinders the ability of that company to expand. What a conundrum!

Unfortunately, it crosses the uncanny valley along the way and feels too much like a dry, abstract game for me to appreciate. Even after several rounds, I can't engage myself in the opportunities to feint and sabotage companies. The overpriced Queen edition doesn't help its case either. This is one of those games where I think its design is flawless, yet have little desire to play it.

This was a nice little train game. It has hidden shares, but you can get an idea for what the other players have by paying attention to their trades.

A very simple, light game that could be played by almost anyone. I am glad I own it and look forward to playing it more in the future.

Paris Connection is a dense 30 minutes. The rules-to-depth ratio is as low as any I can imagine. Players do one of two things on their turns. Both of those things can influence the game in subtle, interesting ways. Learning how to play takes two minutes, but learning how to play well requires understanding the game, understanding the other players, and manipulating incentives to achieve your own ends. The interaction ranges from clever to parasitic to downright nasty. 

It's much less opaque but in a similar vein to Imperial, with a lot less time and overhead. There's some of the deduction and incentive manipulation of Modern Art as well. Paris Connection is not as deep as either of those games, but it's deeper than it has any right to be given the playing time. Well worth the setup, the hassle of which is overstated unless everyone is playing badly and the game ends abruptly. My only issue is that learning the game is more fun than mastering it, which makes it a good game rather than a great one.

RATING: 6
Feels like a combination of Loco! and Wabash Cannonball/Chicago Express:
- instead of playing cards to change the value of one of the chips (Loco), you're expanding train networks to increase the value of one of the companies
- track build is the cube system in many other recent Winsome games (Wabash)
- on your turn, either build or invest (Wabash)
- one difference: you can now trade your chips/shares
- another: in Loco!, values can go up or down; here, they only go up (not a huge difference, really, since you really care about the values relative to each other)

A very light train-themed game that shares the cubes-as-track system of other recent Winsome games, but also uses those same cubes as stock! That little change makes for some interesting decisions about when to acquire shares (which limits that company's growth). The game ought to play VERY quickly ... even my first game (with two slow players) took just over 30 minutes (I think the game probably plays fine in 15-20 minutes).

From a production standpoint, the board is functional and works well. It could be prettier, but I don't think that would add much -- you don't need much more on the map! It would be nice, however, if the board included an extra cube/marker per color, and a value track to display the share value of each company (we used a d20 per company).

A good game, but I prefer heavier and longer ones. 

--- Summary ---
Place a cube of each color in the 6 hexes around Paris. Each player randomly draws x (varies by player number) cubes, kept hidden behind shield. Then sort the cubes into their respective company supply boxes. On your turn, either expand a railroad (add to their network using 1-5 cubes from their supply; max 1 cube/city hex; max 2 cubes/country hex) or acquire shares (return a cube to company box, and take 1 or 2 other cubes). 

The game ends at the end of the round when either a company reaches Marseilles, or 5 company's supply boxes are empty. Then, each player calculates the value of their shares: the value of each cube in a company depends on the cities in which their tracks have been built. You lose 20 VP for each share you have greater than y (varies by player number); most VP wins!

This is actually a good game. Simple to learn and very easy to get in to. Playable in 30 minutes but with a strong sense of timing included, meaning that if players want to play it properly the timing of finishing it is one of the most important things this game has. 
Light/medium filler with high replayability. It should work better with 4 and more players because the distribution of the stocks is more hidden in a certain sense although the control of the game seems to be less with more players. Very clever design.

Played again in a 5 player game. Longer than my first game mainly because players knew better this time and prevented a company from finishing it too early. That last Marseille 4 Francs spot can make the difference and players should focus on that. The company that gets to play south has that advantage or characteristic but it is not a clear given advantage. Much more important that that is the initial cube distribution which seems to wrap the entire strategy in a simple way if (only if) the cube distribution is really obvious such as getting 3/4 cube of the same color. When something like that happens players tend to follow the "let's put a lot of cubes from this company on the map and end it quickly". But even this strategy (obvious but risky) shouldn't grant victory if players respond with massive stock exchange and even with cube wasting. Destroying the ability of company to score is one of my favorite strategies because although it seems a negative way to go (and it is) it's also the better defensive strategy to get (one of the few and certainly the most effective).

RATING: 9
Extremely fast, plays well with 4 (havent tried it with other player counts yet).  It's a a fun little dance involved for such deceptively simple rules.

Your initial stock draw is crucial but not game- winning or losing, rather it sets up how you will try and play.  The great part of the game is the riffing off the other player's actions, as you attempt to guide their beliefs in what will be valuable at the end.

The only hesitation I have, which keeps me so far from giving it a 10, is that with skilled players, the difference between first and second place is often just a single mid-range stock share, and I think that with too-frequent play this would shake out to being fundamentally random, based solely on who gets the opportunity (based on the other players actions) to buy an opportunistic share rather than building track.

I don't know how the Queen production works, but the Winsome version has a bit of an annoyingly long setup for such a short game--first you have to mix all the cubes for the random draw, then re-sort them again to their track-holding areas.  And really, to play more seriously, you also have to take the time to arrange them in said box, to allow for easy counting of how many cubes are left--not for your first few games, but after that you need to be able gauge how many tracks to build to allow for a final purchase even if everyone else tries to build it out.

cant wait to try the expansions!

I'm still not sure if I like to play Paris Connection; certainly I have no idea how to play in order to win. But I appreciate it very much.

Many games, particularly train games, include a stock ownership component: you buy and sell shares, which are worth money; and you build train routes and so on, which increase the value of the companies and in turn the shares. Paris Connection/SNCF's genius is distilling this to the absolute basics -- train tokens can be played on the board to build connections between cities, which increase that company/colour's value, or kept by players as shares. The more routes are built, the more valuable the shares get, but the fewer there are available.

It plays better if new shares are kept in front of the screen (not hidden).

It's incredibly elegant and it plays extremely quickly. The real downsides are that setup time is quite long and fiddly given the length of the game (cubes would work much better than stupid trains), and strategically it's both very open and highly opaque which makes games with new players unpleasant. 

In part for these issues but mostly because some of my usual gaming partners do not share my enthusiasm for the game, I am regretfully trading it.

Light filler, but with a set-up time (put all the cubes in a bag, randomly and secretly distribute some to each player, but then get all cubes out again, sort by color on a grid) that makes it onerous for its payout.

I've played this game a few times.  I really like it.  I think it's the best new game I've played in a while.  The cool things about this, are that as you play more, I think the game changes.  Figuring out what your opponents interests are is just as important as advancing your own.

For a game that plays 3-5 players and honestly plays in about 45 minutes including the rules explanation, it's a winner.

Interesting game and very short for a Winsome (our game was over in less than 15 minutes - it almost took as long to set up and teach as it did to play! The balancing of stocks vs. tracks played is a nice mechanic (i.e. the more tracks played, the fewer stocks are available). Need to play this more to see if my rating stands. Great filler for a Winsome evening of gaming! The cube draw at the beginning is the only troubling thing as it is a lot of work for such a simple game.

So far, so good. I really like this one. Plays very quickly, sometimes insanely quickly, and very easy to teach. With the rules out of the way you're left thinking several moves ahead, and trying to read your opponents' intentions a few moves ahead as well. And you'd better anticipate correctly! Or better yet, just MAKE them do what you want...

This is the classic train and stock game boiled down to its core essence. As with Reiner Knizia's similarly stripped-down game Quandary and several Alan Moon games, players balance their moves between expanding a company/train line and investing in it. Paris Connection is extremely streamlined and quick, but for all its simplicity it presents just enough opportunity for strategy and meaningful choices that it's likely to entertain even veteran gamers.

Paris Connection is excellent filler for 20-minutes (it nearly takes longer to set up than to play).  But the fact that Queen repackaged the simple little SNCF into a giant $45 square box--as large as Ticket to Ride!--is galling, even misleading. Delightful but not substantial, Paris Connection is not worth the price or shelf space. This gets a one point penalty for lunacy, but I'd buy it for $10 less in the Chicago Express box.  Anybody listening?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Initial impression is that the game is fantastic. It's a 20 minute version of Chicago Express. There's no money to manage or auctions, though, as the trains themselves represent your stock in a company. On a turn all that you can do is either build track or trade one of your own trains with one or two trains from the supply.

Building track is a way to increase the value of a given train color, and switching your trains gives you the chance to get rid of cheap trains and take the ones that are worth more.

In this simple system there's a lot of variety as players build track to nowhere in order to keep a train's value low, or maybe race to build track across the board in order to quickly end the game before the other players have time to improve their own score. Nice little game, well worth the $23 or so that it goes for online.

Great so far, rating could rise.  Nice, light filler with a bit more going on than meets the eye.

To be honest, this is a game that would greatly benefit from being played online.  Counting the cubes on the board + cubes in stock and subtracting from 32 to figure out how many cubes are behind player screens is not ideal.

I agree with Scott's comment that cubes acquired in trade should be public knowledge.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Filler length, but there is some meat on this bone.  An intriguing little game with tough tradeoffs to consider on every move -- taking shares limits the upside of the railroad you are taking shares in, selling shares improves the potential payoff of the railroad you sold, and laying track can give others a chance to buy into a railroad you just improved.  I expect this will get many, many plays in our group.  Also, I'll note that I don't find the setup that onerous -- with four people working to sort the cubes it takes about 2 mintues.

RATING: 7
Though not as deep as the best games, this is an excellent filler.  How many board games can you play with up to 6 players and be done in less than 45 minutes?  It fits a nice niche.  This is also the best game I have found for a family that has a 4-6 year old who just wants to play a game.  We let our 4 year old just pick a color each turn and put out 5 trains according to the rules; she doesn't get involved with the stock side.  This works perfectly for that.  She's not going to win, of course, but she can have fun and defintiely influence the course of the game.

RATING: 7
Paris Connection is a light fillerish train stock market game. There's something like 32 trains in each of five colors (maybe six). The trains represent both track you can lay on the board and the stock shares of that company.

There's a map of France with cities sprinkled around the board. On your turn you either take two shares of a company (which are the same train tokens used to build track), trade a share of one stock for the share of another stock or place 1-5 trains of a single color on the board.

When you place trains on the board you have to extend the route that's been built (branching is fine). Two colors of trains can fill any forest hex but only one color can place in the cities. Cities are worth 1, 2, or 3 points for the company that builds to them. The current values of each stock is tracked dynamically.

The game ends when either, all the trains of all but two companies have been taken (either as shares or laid as track) or if any company reaches Marsailles.

The game was quick and light, but there was some opportunity to be thinky. I suspect that different groups might settle into different strategies. I played twice and no one ever tried to tank a stock by wasting their trains, for example. I enjoyed it, but it was over so quick.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
THIS is the simple stock game I'd been looking for. It feels unmistakably like a stock game, there's nothing superfluous in the design, it doesn't (strongly) depend on hidden information, and it's also fast and fun to play. No randomness except for setup, and this randomness also helps it dodge the early game aimlessness I've felt in other stock-like games, as your initial holdings (which are randomized) indicate options that might be sensible.

On your turn you either trade stock (give up a train for 1-2 of a different color) or lay track (put 1-5 trains from the supply on the board, which can connect cities and increase the value of the line). Stock and track come from the same supply and it's quite limited.

There's a minor thematic oddity (and distance from being a "pure" stock game to my mind) in that owning stock doesn't give you any extra power to control the line. You can lay track for any line you want even with no shares in it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.8
very good, fast, light Winsome game.  The mechanic of taking shares making the company less expandable is very reminiscent of King of Siam, and just as tricky to manage.  Fast expansion of a company means more people want the shares, hence the expansion stops.  Timing of the end game is key (as with many winsome games) and racing to Marsielles is the sure fire way to end.  But only do so if you think you have won !
This is more abstract than train game, but is very good (just as Samarkand is more train game than about trade routes and families).

This was an after thought purchase that remains in thought long after our initial plays: certainly a hallmark of a good game. While turns are fast and rules are quite simple, the implications of each action for either train placement or trading can really have a reverberating impact on the unfolding of subsequent player actions. I agree with other reviewers that this game is more about trading your stock than it is about train placement. Having the foresight of grabbing rising stocks while ditching stagnant ones can lead to a satisfying victory. Not truly a train game but rather a stock manipulation game with spatial elements, I give this game high marks for its deceptive simplicity. My only concern is that repeated plays will lead to familiarity with the game board which is quite static in the scoring location. This game screams for board modularity. While I despise buying expansions, this game probably requires additional maps....then again, who I am kidding about 'repeated plays'!

The system itself is very elegant. It is a extremely simpe train game withouth any money! Using trains as stocks and as route markers is quite clever. But unfortunately, I did not find the game play to be very interesting. Also, the setup is quite annoying for such a short game.

It's unfortunate that this game's simple rules harm how it's perceived.  If anyone in your group dismisses this as boring or lacking strategy they can sabotage the whole game.  But there's real depth here along with a bit of psyching others out.  Really like the game, but fear I won't get to play it nearly as much as I want to.

Edit: Dropped the rating from 8 to 6.  The majority of gamers I introduce this to don't like it.  The depth is just too hidden for too many people.  What good is a game if most people don't connect to it or understand the subtle strategy required?

Needs more flesh and more soul.

[i]Paris Connection[/i] is a completely disposable groupthink exercise that is overpriced by at least $30 - and this is from a guy who normally likes train/stock games, both large and small.  At least it's over in 15-20 minutes, which makes it equivalent (in time, not entertainment) to either a really short pig roast or a really long slap fight.

[i]Connection[/i] is even less fun, I imagine, when the mechanics break down and everyone spends their initial turns drawing up to their full stock limit rather than laying trains - which is acceptable under the current ruleset.

Queen's trend of retitling and rereleasing mediocre Winsome games has got to stop.*

*[i]Chicago Express[/i] (formerly [i]Wabash Cannonball[/i]) being the only exception.

I kinda feel bad giving this a 5 but I feel like the "average...take it or leave it" fits. A VERY light and equally short take on a stock/share train game. The problem is the game is so short that you don't have time to really try anything. I feel like if you wanted to try a more complicated strategy, you'd just end up being too far behind and lose. You basically check what you have, improve that, guess where others are going (fairly obvious) and hop on that...20 minutes later the game is over. Possibly a good intro stock game or gateway but not for me. I'm honestly shocked at all the positive press this game is getting.

The game is easy to teach and learn. Uninspiring game mechanic, where the main push and pull is between using trains as stocks or for laying tracks. Player interaction is on the low side. Wording and hexes on the game board are on the small side. The choice of the train colour could be better as once the board fills up a little, it may be a little hard to tell them apart.

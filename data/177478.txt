RATING: 10
Brilliant design by a relatively unknown designer that combines tried and true mechanics with very subtle and unique twists, while doing a good job of linking gameplay to theme. 

The game has you take on the role of a Japanese artisan in the old city marketplace of Edo.  There are 12 rounds (with some similarities to in the year of the dragon) and an additional action round at the end of the game. Each turn you select your turn order, which is based on your firefighting proficiency and this selection mechanism is a big part of the genius of this game. Your choice of 1,2,3,4 or "x" determines your choice of artisan cards (earlier choice is obviously better), and your rondel-like movement around the market in terms of both how far you can move AND what actions will be available at the location you finish your movement and in this instance it really depends on where you are on the board and what you need so depending on your situation any of the choices may be the one you need and want. And it is very important to note that you can only move around the board clockwise, you cannot stop short but you can move more spaces for a cost (using sandals which is one the "currencies" in the game). This makes for really difficult choices at times. 

After order selection, in turn order, you have the option of hiring an artisan which come in 5 general types but most of them are unique, but there are several aspects to consider here.  They cost money to hire and money can be tight. They all have abilities that you and other players can use, they pay out income that only you benefit from, they need a space to open shop on the board, they come in 5 different "colors" and you have set collection considerations in this game, and they require a worker of sorts to run the shop and you are limited to 4 at a time. If you don't hire you can always pass and get 4 coins (this is a very very viable and strategic decision sometimes even when you already have coins). Hired artisans are immediately placed on the board upon hiring.

Once everyone has hired or passed, you move your artisan clockwise and finish in a space in the market that is always associated with a fixed action and ideally one or two placed artisan actions (the cards that were hired previously). You are allowed to take the fixed action and one of the card actions, in any order so you always want to try to do both.  The fixed actions are: 1) purchase 2 sandals for 2 coin, 2) purchase 2 rice for 3 coin, 3) improve your firefighting prowess by one level, 4) purchase tobacco and/or pipe for increasing gold and these are one of the means to score end game points as well as gain some firefighting experience, 5) exchange 1 sandal or 1 rice for 5 coin, 6) purchase 1 rice for 1 coin or pay 1 coin for the opportunity to build a building (think Puerto Rico style end game prestige buildings, yet another way to score end game points), 7) pay increasing coin to purchase a fish (more endgame set collection points), and 8) purchase 1 or 2 gold for 6 coin each (gold is an essential resource for building prestige buildings).  An important consideration are the adjacent card actions; if you use other players, they get to advance their experience, and ideally you want your artisans to advance to the point where they are removed from the board as you still get income and endgame points but don't have to feed them or worry about fires, and most importantly you regain access to your limited supply of artisan workers needed to run the shop/card.  This firs lead to some tricky situations though where cards you were hoping to use can vaporize off the board before you get to act. As well, every time you "do a lap" around the board, you age your own artisans so there can incentive to choose late in turn order simply to cycle through your cards.

At the end of every three rounds you collect the income of your artisans (coin, in game points, rice, sandals, powers) you pay 1 rice to feed each active shopkeeper you own on the board (or you lose them), and you score in game points based on whether or not you matched your shopkeepers colors to it her shopkeepers in a city district. Also three times during the game you have a fire, where you randomly draw a tile that represents one of the four quadrants. You can play safe and invest in firefighting and also improve your turn order selection, or you can play Rudy and try to build behind other strong firefighters and/or take the 25% chance that your building will burn down. 

The last turn allows you to move anywhere on the board (in firefighting order) and take any action you want. Finally end game points are tallied (left over coin, wood, gold which are minor, and fish and artisan set collection, tobacco, and prestige buildings).  

This game is the definition of a hidden gem. I'm on bgg all the time and I completely missed the boat on this game hadn't even heard of it. It's thematic, strategic, tactical, easy to learn, original, reasonably quick to play, and works well at all player counts (2-4).  Needs a major publisher to get a wide release, might be the best of 2016.

Kickstarted at Artisan level. After one play, I like it, and want to play more to get a better sense of strategy. It's a "VP salad" game with a lot of choices to be made with every move, each one often conflicting with the benefits you want to get from it.

After several plays - it is a little confusing at times, but it's a great game with lots of options. 7.5 for the game play, 8 for the aesthetics.

Quite a bit more thinky than I was expecting, given that it's just a rondel and set collection, but that's a pretty good achievement just in itself.

If you like Glen More, this is a pretty solid step up from it in thinkiness, but has a similar feel. (Minus the tile laying, obviously, but there's still sufficient figuring to do.)

RATING: 3
Let me start by saying some positive things about the game.  I think that this game is filled with a lot of capable euro design ideas, and it does play, and thankfully, it does end.  However...

This is a game that coincidentally combines a number of mechanisms I do not care for including:  repeated random events (here fires) that may, or may not, kill some players' pieces on the board; spending hours moving round and round and round and round on a circular track; trying to cajole other players to semi-cooperatively purchase things from your stalls in order for you to benefit; frequently forcing the player, last in turn order, to "get things" they do not want to "get" (in this case, curiously, essentially forcing them to move a number of spaces on the board they do not want to move, or pay a lot of money to move the number of spaces they do want to move.  How does forced movement on a board feel?); and far too much down time between turns.  

True, we played a four player game, with serious gamers, and I suspect that Iki plays much better with three casual gamers, but the three hours we spent playing this game was so interminably bad for me (when is this game going to end?!), I have to honestly say I have zero desire to play this game again.

非常非常非常喜欢IKI。
我虽然在KS上back了典藏版，但是还是迫不及待地从加拿大买了一盒零售版回来。游戏的时代背景、美工设计和机制完美地融合在一起，思考量也恰到好处（每一步行动的选择都非常重要，但是又不会让人觉得脑子太累）。
拿到零售版以后，和身边桌游圈的朋友们前前后后已经开了十几局，2人局、3人局、4人局都尝试过不止一次。相比之下，4人局是最好的，游戏的所有元素都能体验到；2人局每个月最后安排中立职人的行动也非常出彩；相比之下3人局略显平淡。
作为刷分的德式游戏，得分线路是否多元化也是衡量游戏设计的一环，IKI在这一点上表现相当不错：粮食流、草鞋流、建筑流、收集流、刷分职人流我们都有人尝试过，我觉得每种“流派”都有获胜的机会。当然，长线计划的实现还要取决于游戏过程中对手的应对和其他一切随机因素，也有可能需要临场决断来中途转型，比如收藏鱼和烟草是很容易被对手针对的，但是如果能成功收集齐，所得的分数也相当可观；再比如，是否成功地修建建筑可能会左右整个游戏的结果，但是修建建筑所需的行动也非常多，尤其是高分建筑，在这之中哪一环出问题都有可能造成计划的破产。
IKI既有长线策略，玩家间又有丰富的互动，有一定的随机因素（主要体现在每月新抽的职人卡和火灾事件）但是还算可控（有人觉得火灾比较……但是如果你防火等级足够，火灾都是浮云），加上非常棒的美工和精致的配件，真是不可多得的好游戏。
现在我会期待典藏版到手，我还为此单配了日式的金属币 :)

12/22/2015: Finally got a game of this since my Kickstarter arrived a couple of weeks ago. Fun, solid game that uses a rondel to good effect. Needs a few more plays to settle on a rating. 

Love the various layers that come on when thinking about whether to take the 1,2,3, or 4 on the 'Way of Life' track: what store do you want to land on, do you want to hire an artisan before someone else, and the pressure to advance around the board to level up your guys. Squashing all three into one choice is a great mechanic. 

Not so great, on one play, is the mechanic of constructing buildings. Seems like a lot of steps (getting wood and koban, then the construct action, then placing them and locking up a meeple). Admittedly, the payoff may be there but only late in the game, so it seems like a lot of 'game mechanic space' to allocate to something that only comes in the last quarter of the game. Again, one play, so this could definitely change. Looking forward to playing again.

Kickstarter. Received Dec 10, 2015. 

Love the game! Very well designed, balanced and developed game. It has streamlined and elegant gameplay. Rules only take 15 minutes to explain.

Shades of Navegador's rondel...but coupled with a second action. Many aspects of the game have a duality. Love the thematic threat of the random fire. Lots of paths to victory. 

A wide variety of different professions to hire. 

Thematic and historically inspired art. 

Scales well at all player counts of 2, 3 or 4.

This needs a wide release to get the recognition it deserves.

Update after 1 year and 12 plays: it has made it to the pantheon of a "10" rating. Gameplay has held up. It is THAT good.
So ripe for expansions...though very unlikely to see the light of day.

UPDATE: October 2017, dropped the game down to 9.5 because while it shines a 2p or 3p, the 4p didn't have a lot of control. This game is a 10 as a 3p, but not as a 4p.

RATING: 9
Excellent variety of strategies, which can lead to some AP, especially late game, but still a fantastic mid-weight Euro with absolutely fantastic art and a unique theme.

Iki can be a bit daunting for first timers or newbies, and will require a 10- or so minute teach, but once the game gets started, the pieces fall into place like tumblers in a lock. Some strategies can be less rewarding others, but a focus on the shopkeepers, and set collection are a good foundation for a solid finish.

Positives: Art and components, variety of strategies, randomized merchants lead to great replayability, lots of long-term thinking and short-term planning makes every turn important, player interaction is interesting when deciding where to install merchants, whether to help opponents by visiting their shops, and racing to collect tobacco/fish.

Negatives: tough teach for first-time players, AP-inducing choices (especially late game).

Classic Euro dilemmas of feeding people and gathering strength against semi-random, periodic adversity, while trying to gain momentum toward hard-earned VP's. Interaction is through opening and positioning market stalls to attract your opponents, while setting up synergies and collecting sets for points. The whole thing is played out on a full-board rondel.

There's nothing particularly unique in this title, but somehow it all seems fresh and inspired. Clearly there's something to be said for starting from a personal passion (an ancient Japanese work of art called the Kidai Shoran) and using the conventions of the medium to express that love.

Highly recommended!

Another excellent Japanese game. IKI is a thing of beauty. The artwork is stunning. And beneath that there is a very good Euro lurking. The game is based around a rondel and that rondel gives a real intuitive rhythm to the game. Turns are quick too so there is limited downtime. There is engine building, tension, a bit of drama, and a feeling of time as you play through the seasons.

Whilst the gameplay is by no means revolutionary, this is a very solid Euro and a joy to play, and a joy to look at. Recommended.

RATING: 7
IKI is a worker movement game or perhaps it can be viewed as a 8-space rondel game. Each round, based on firefighting/turn order track, players will choose initiative and movement. Earlier in turn order means less in movement, while later in the turn order means means more movement. Then in turn order, people play their turns. This consists of choosing income or hiring an employee. When you hire someone, you put them in a district and there are two spots available behind each rondel space. Then the player moves and can take one rondel action and one of the two employee actions (assuming someone is there) in either order. Using opponent's employees level them up for a better payout later in the game and using your own does nothing. When your worker moves past the 8th rondel spot all your own employees level up. Usually after gaining 3 levels they retire off the board to the owning player's tableau. At the end of every three rounds, your workers (retired or not) will provide benefits, there will be scoring opportunities and you have to feed your workers if able. If not, they go away. At least, they provided their benefit first. Three times in the game, a fire will hit one of 4 random areas on the board (which potentially affects 4/16 spots on the board) and the same spot can be hit more than once. This fire has the potential to kill employees if the owner's fire fighting isn't up to snuff.  There is other resource management and point salady things going on.

I enjoyed this game a lot more than I initially thought. There is a lot of forward planning in not only your turn, but the resources you want to acquire, how to feed workers (or not), and trying to get various set collection bonuses. The game is also a bit more interactive than your typical euro. That said, it isn't negative interaction. Which is a good thing in my books. My only concern is that the workers of the later half of the game can provide a very healthy VP income compared to early workers. Also, the points in an approximately 100 point game have usually been within 10 points of one another. Maybe it's too balanced. It's probably fine, but I will keep an eye on it in future plays.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Decent game, lots of interesting stuff going on. 

Two big issues; 

The randomness of the fire seems to be a punishing mechanic, I would prefer if all the quads caught on fire, or at least 3. 

The last player really gets a poor choice of movement. I would recommend trying to allow players to pay 2 money to go on an already occupied movement space. This is still punishing, but not so ridiculous, it makes for more interesting decisions.

1x 3-player game with Sanjuro

Very strange game. I guess after a few games the options opened by each choice are more obvious but the first turns you are totally helpless. I started 3rd out of 3 players, having nothing better to do, I decided to try to improve this situation. It turns out that it is next to impossible to fight for playing position. I managed to end up first ONE turn out of 12, and only because of other players choices, not mine. Quite strange. After a full game I still have a hard time understanding how it might be possible to plan anything ahead. Obviously there is a learning curve since the most experienced won (but only by 8 or 9 points or so). 

I really like the overall design and graphic choices made and the material is of good quality. A missing item would be a player aid with an end-game scoring reminder, we kept asking "how much is a wood/money/gold/set of fishes/artisans/tobaco Worth at the end of the game ?"

Overall, I am more than ready to play this game again, keeping in mind that the aim is to open options rather than specialize and that having a very tactical approach might be better than to try to choose a strategic axe early on. Nonetheless to be able to exploit increased flexibility one has to have choice, which are extremely dependant of turn order. Hence, one of the points that I would like to clarify is how the turn order really works, and if it is really possible to kick the first player out of his position (unless he decides not to fight for it).

IKI can't decide whether it wants to be a tactical or a strategic game, and although it doesn't necessarily have to be bad to have strong elements of either orientation the possibly devastating impact of the randomly striking fires is quite annoying in a game that otherwise expects and rewards meticulous calculation.

YEDO. EDO. IKI. Langsam dürften Tokyo die Namen ausgehen für seine Brettspiele. Die Idee in IKI ist so alt wie das bezaubernd abgebildete althistorische Tokyo. Das Spielbrett fusst auf einer uralten Bildrolle, dem sogenannten Kidai Shoran. 12x läuft man mit seiner Figur im Kreis in vollendeter visueller Schönheit im Wechsel der Jahreszeiten zu einem Handelsort, macht dort ein oder zwei Handelsaktionen: man besorgt sich Waren wie Reis, Holz, Gold oder Geld. Eine Feuerversicherung bekommt man dort auch, denn 3x im Spiel brechen Brände aus und fackeln Geschäfte an den Handelsorten ab, denen die eigenen Händler zum Opfer fallen können. Was leicht klingt, spielt sich durch die in jeder Runde für jeden Spieler neu festgelegten Zugweite korsetthaft: oft kommt man nicht zum Handelsort, wo man dringend hin müsste. Taktische Zwänge wie Spielerreihenfolge oder die Schrittweite zu Handelsorten durchkreuzen mittelfristige strategische Überlegungen und machen IKI zu einem zwischen beiden unentschieden changierenden Zwittergeschäft. Dazu passt, dass IKI schlecht skaliert und quasi nur zu viert sein Wesen entfaltet. Dieses eigene Zwangsjacke-Spielgefühl mag nicht jedem gefallen. Hinzu kommt ein Hauch von Anarchie, da einem andere im Spiel durchaus schmerzhaft in die Parade fahren können. IKI ist ein zwillingshafter Zwangscharakter, dessen grandioses Artwork es einem erleichtert den zwillingshaften Zwangscharakter zu lieben, wie ich es tue.

Feeding your people is more of this game than it should be.  The limiting spaces for buildings at the end seems unbalanced as do "Fires" that aren't strategic at all really.  I do love the rondel and turn order/move length along with the ranking your people and bonus retirement(unlike Praetor where it is negative).  Seems like it needs development and some cleanup of the artwork on the board.  Liked the Tobacco and Fish spots.  Really needs some more interesting bits like that and less food and fire junk. Creative scoring spaces/avenues and more interesting card powers would have really made this game a winner.

A decent game with very interesting mechanisms.

BUT the game is too dynamic (chaotic?) and thus not controllable enough.  At least with 4 players.  Possibly the rating for 2-, 3-player game can be higher but I played only with 4.

The readability/ergonomy of graphic design is outrageous.

RATING: 8
Initial rating one 2 player game

I found it fairly reminiscent of one of my Fav's, In the Year of the Dragon: Quite Thematic for a Euro, Fairly Unique (less the nods to ITYOTD here), Strategic incl. planning ahead for possible disasters, Multiple Paths to Victory and Round and Turn order structure are very similar including some events. I'm quite sure it was an influence here I would just note the game does play quite differently in practice. 

With that said and given my rating of course I liked it a good bit, my only concerns thus far revolve around the BIG VP building builds, it would be nice if a few more were included in the box, and more concerning is they are NOT immune to fire events (so lots of time and planning for it could be lost if not careful) OR if you try waiting to lessen fire risk the one you worked hard for can be snapped up from someone else right before you build it. One more thing is the fires attack a "random" spot on the board, and quite literally someone could be unfairly [i]burned[/i] here if it hits them too often.    

Played quite good with 2 but not hard to see 3 or 4 would likely be somewhat better ie. tighter due to more competition for things, though I suspect 3 might be the sweet spot for competition vs control.

I find the engine building in this game, however the design of the components could be made clearer. I also think the fire mechanic not harsh enough and lucky. Gameplay is a bit clunky at time.

Iki is a euro game with some interesting features and some frustrating ones too. It's a game of collecting VP from multiple sources. The most prevalent source of points are shops that you can establish in one of the four quadrants of the board. There are many types of shops and you score VP equal to the square of the number of different shops you've established at the end of the game (e.g. 4 shops -> 16VP; 5 shops -> 25VP).

[b]Positive interaction[/b]
Shops have a deal they are offering, and 3 experience levels (when you set it up it's at level 1). Player's have shoppers running around the market, where they stop they are allowed to use the deal of one shop. If they choose an opponent's shop, that shop levels up (if it levels above 3 then the shop retires and goes into the collection of the owner). At the end of a season you receive the bonus listed on the current experience level of your shops (retired shops give you the level 3 bonus).

Resources are very tight in the game so if you manage to find a shop that offers what people want they will have no qualms helping you out while helping themselves. I should note that this interaction also has the potential to be negative since shops on the board do occasionally provide points and you could force an opponent's shop to retire.

The positive interaction is well done, and the whole leveling shop mechanism is fun and leads to interesting decisions.

[b]You can't get there from here[/b]
A round starts with players choosing 'wake up time'. In this game the earliest to wake will hire first but receive 1 movement point, the next will hire second and receive 2 movement points, and so on. When moving around the market you must do so in an anticlockwise fashion, and you must move exactly the number of spaces you selected. You can add special tokens to move further but you cannot move fewer spaces.

This can be extremely frustrating as you may need very specific resources and there are often very few (if any) options for gaining them. It seemed to be difficult to plan for future turns, and even if you did you could get screwed if players ahead of you took the movement options you needed. It could simply be a case of needing to understand the game better, but I definitely felt that these constraints were more frustrating than they were worth.

[b]Fire sale[/b]
There are a few fires during the game that can destroy your shops. You have ways to protect yourself but it cannot be ignored that the fire hits a random quadrant each time, allowing for luck to play a role. I found the ramifications of this random element were too dire. The game has very few random elements so having this one yield so much power seemed out of place.

[b]Conclusion[/b]
It's an interesting game, and I would be very interested in trying it a few more times to see if there are hidden depths. However, I'm not optimistic that I will ultimately like the game very much. I think the things that detract from the experience will remain, even if I understand the game better.

Better than I expected from this hyped kickstarter. Iki is mostly tactical which I don't consider bad. The key decision each turn is how many steps to take on the rondel. Depending on this choice are the actions which can be selected and the order in which cards are bought and movements are made. Two other elements of Iki are important: the Feldian fire track determining the order of choosing the number of steps and the set collection. The latter almost feels like an afterthought and surprisingly lacklustre for a system contributing a considerable percentage of endgame points.

The random strike of the fire is only a problem if you ignore the fire track which is a weak choice anyway given the importance of turn order. I can't imagine playing Iki with any other player count than 4 as it will get too tame with less. If there's a weakness that keeps me from buying, it's the variety not being on a level required for frequent play of a 2hrs+ game.

The theme and artwork mean nothing to me. The rondel-ish element is kind of interesting, but the threat of fire never seems daunting and the choices don't seem very interesting. I like what they were trying to do here but it seems underdeveloped and just a little bit boring.

Really neat game that features a rondel around which you move and you can visit shops around the marketplace and buy and trade goods. You hire shopkeepers to populate the market with shops and you move around the market in order to take actions at market stalls owned by yourself and other players. Takes about 90 minutes for 3 players and is always a pleasant experience.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Really enjoyed my first play even though I didn't fare really well. One should likely be made aware of the cards from the different periods and what they do before starting a game so one is aware of what is to come as far as shops and what they do. Oh, and don't forget to acquire enough rice to feed your employees, otherwise that money you spent hiring them will not be fully utilized as they starve after you earn the income from them. Ideally, you want your employees to retire quickly as you continue to gain income from them but do not have to feed them (and they also may count towards end game scoring if they are a unique color from other retirees). There is danger of losing workers to fires if one does not maintain a high enough firefighter value although if you build behind opponents who do you are also safe. That same track determines player order for choosing how far one desires to go around the track and in determining when/who you can hire. Curious to explore more!

Love this one!

It is a euro at heart with one sharp element of luck at three points in the game. It feels short, but the decisions require some planning ahead since you don't have a lot of time to gather the rice bales and mon that you need most turns. Often times, you will only have one chance at what you want every time, so part of the strategy is to hire merchants and place them right where people need them. They will be loathe to use your merchants, but if there is enough incentive, people will stop by.

And then there is that sharp element of luck known as the fires... fires are a greater risk vs. reward factor than you will find in any other euro, but it is completely avoidable if you devote enough effort toward firefighting. As to be expected, you will sacrifice other things to be good at it, so there is a great layer of complexity added with the fires. You also get a significant side-benefit (or main benefit?) of firefighting, which is that the best firefighter also gets first picks, which are always delicious in any euro.

I do think there is a lot more to learn about the game including how to mess with the other players through manipulating turn order (and using sandals on the rondel) and activating artisans (forcing them to retire before another player can use them).  Seeing this, the game is probably best played with four.  Or at the very least three.  The artwork in [b][thing=177478][/thing][/b] is quite evocative of the period (Tokugawa Japan).  In some ways, it reminds me of another favourite of mine, [b][thing=73439][/thing][/b].  But as nice as the artwork is, especially on the cards, some of the abilities of those artisan cards don't really make sense thematically.  Like the Dice Maker gives wood.  Wouldn't he consume wood (to make the dice) and give you cash (or at least the chance of cash from gambling)?  The game also reduces [b]いき[/b] ("iki") to a sort of consumerism rather than aesthetics and natural beauty.  Sure, the concept may have emerged from the merchant class, but it's certainly not about buying the nicest or the most stuff from them.  None of my criticisms is going to turn me off playing the game though, because it's a solid game.

Played once. I was expecting a buy-and-sell economic game, but it turned out to be more of a resource gathering and conversion exercise. A fun one, luckily, but with few really unique mechanisms, and a few too many bells and whistles for my taste. That might sound negative, but it shouldn't be. This is a solid and fun game.

Bought from Boardgamebliss 3/3/16.

Iki certainly has some unique mechanics and has some solid mechanisms.  I like the angst of having to choose between getting the resources I want and leveling up my merchants.  There's a lot of tense decision making, and the set collection aspect adds some extra depth.

The problem is that it felt very zero-sum at 2 player.  If I put a merchant on one corner, Mary puts one of her merchants there so she doesn't have to frequent mine.  This is probably a much better 3p/4p game.

Un jeu de gestion récent qui ne fait pas dans la surenchère d'éléments. Système de jeu assez simple et élégant. Rappelle subtilement Bruxelles dans ses choix à multiples imbrications, les Mac Gerdts dans l'enchainement des actions (boucle) ou encore Caylus dans la construction et le partage des cases d'actions. 
Il y a juste quelques résidus d'éléments qui m'ont semblé un peu déconnectés du reste (les jetons PV à choper sur le plateau).
Le respect visuel d'oeuvres réelles est intéressant mais c'est souvent assez vilain car mal mis en avant par l'infographie et de plus il y a quelques choix curieux voire maladroit d'ergonomie (mais rien de dramatique).

It is a very pleasant game. Beautiful artwork, thoughtfully designed wooden meeples, with rondel as the main mechanic for action selection, plus some market action for economy, set collection & area control for other scoring. Everything is integrated very well. Feeding gives just enough pressure and the building race is competitive. I would play it every time when asked, and would suggest to play if there isn't enough time for a meatier game. It is definitely pleasant to play and to look at but I do have some doubts on its replayability.

To start let me say I really dig the Artwork on this one, it really feels like a Japanese game!

I LOVE the way the players have to choose how far they want to move, 1, 2, 3 or 4 steps, that selection is done in Turn order and one spot has been selected it's blocked for the other players.

 It's not a complicated game but it's a game that offers an increasing amount of choices and you have to weight your options well because the game is tight.
Really like the powers of the Workers/Stalls and the combos that can be created with the fixed location actions on the board.

This is a rondel WP game where the rondel is actually an oblong track around the outside of which are the available actions together with spaces for placing cards (that you buy) also with action spaces. since other players have actioned the cards that you placed a certain number of times then those cards become part of your tableau and grant you special bonuses. The cards are all buildings and 3 times during the game fires break out and can destroy unprotected buildings. Confusing rules translation didn't help but amusing card text offset this: One card had the role of “Ear Cleaner” - this was not a translation error as it had the correct graphic!

Strategico gioco dalla grafica gradevole. Ambientato a Nihonbashi, il quartiere centrale di Edo (vecchio nome di Tokyo), il gioco riproduce le due vie centrali del quartiere, affollate da visitatori alla ricerca di artigiani e negozi per avvalersi dei loro servigi o per acquistare i prodotti offerti: pesce, pipe, legname ecc. Durante i dodici mesi dell'anno i giocatori cercheranno di aumentare il proprio prestigio/punti vittoria. Interessante la fase di sviluppo delle proprie rendite con artigiani che fanno esperienza fino ad andare in pensione, particolare attenzione dovrà essere posta anche alla prevenzione degli incendi che possono vanificare il lavoro svolto. Le dinamiche, fluide, sono composte da tre azioni durante il proprio turno che si ripetono, interessante anche l'ordine dei giocatori che viene scelto ad ogni turno. Il gioco offre in sintesi una profondità strategica non semplice da pianificare e padroneggiare con cognizione. Ottimo gioco dalla durata non elevata che offre molteplici strategie. Una delle migliori scoperte del 2015, anche il prezzo è coerente con il valore del gioco mentre il vero problema è la scarsa diffusione.

Finally, after seven months, I got this to the table. There were many factors which prevented playing this earlier, one of which is the poorly translated rulebook and non-intuitive design of the game itself. However, that doesn't detract from anyone enjoying this wonderful game. Iki is a game set in Edo, the bustling center of commerce and culture in medieval Japan. Turns are straight-forward enough: decide how many spaces you're going to move this turn, hire people or receive income, then move, activating one, both or none of the spaces you land on. Your strategy will shift with every turn because your options and the board will shift every turn so it's very difficult to focus and succeed. But all in all, Iki will definitely get another play from me and my group again, as none of us were able to employ our strategies (only one building was built and only one of us took advantage of the tobacco-pouch-multiplying-point strategy). I didn't expect so much AP and strategy from a seemingly simple game of card-drafting and set collection. There is much in this game to discover, alongside the beautiful artwork and overall design of the game. The phases of a turn may take some getting used to so I'd recommend a slow first round focused on explanation and a little bit of strategy of nagaya and retirement bonuses. Great game and can't wait to play again!

This game involved a bit of a saga for me. In a fit of extravagance, I backed the deluxe version of this on KS, which came with a wooden box and a board that took the form of a Japanese scroll. It all looked rather nice in the KS, tho' it was pretty pricey. Apparently tho' the reality did not live up to expectations and there were complaints from several backers about the poor quality of the finished product. Meanwhile, I got a note from Parcelforce wanting me to pay £50+ customs fees to take delivery of my copy. I protested to the creators, as the project was supposed to be 'Euro-friendly' and they offered to refund my pledge in full if I returned the game. In fact, the game was automatically returned to sender when I refused to pay the fees, and my pledge was refunded. The £/$ exchange rate had worsened substantially between the time of the original pledge and my refund, with the upshot that my refund in sterling was much more than I originally paid - by about enough to pay for this, the ordinary retail edition.  :-)

RATING: 9
Blends an assortment of my favorite board game mechanics into one beautiful creation. IKI feels both familiar and unique. The market is perhaps the most thematically appropriate use of a rondel I've seen in a game. The occasional fire event is reminiscent of Speicherstadt, except a bit more fleshed out since your firefighter strength affects both your turn order and which spots ar safer to build market stalls. Feeding your workers isn't as painful as games like Agricola. IKI rewards you for getting your workers to retirement, earning points and resources every step of the way and continuing to pay out long after they've left the board. 

I like everything about IKI. It's early in the year, but this might be one of the best games of 2016.

Love this game, but am terrible at it. The Japanese theme is well executed. Egg-peddler anyone? The interplay between the turn order mechanism and the marketplace being a rondelle leads to some great moments where people are forced to give up their best move to improve their position for the next round. It's a little complicated to teach to new players but most seem to grasp things within the first round or two. Each game leaves me thinking about how I could improve next time.

RATING: 7
(+) Does so well in evoking the Edo period through the lovely production and mechanisms.  
(+) Inspired integration of the rondel mechanism, which seamlessly fits with the theme of shopping and selling in the crowded Japanese marketplace.  
(+) Card variety and interaction provides a means of clever income-engine building, but it never takes center stage from the dynamic ebbs and flows of the market.  

(-) The fires, as thematic as they are, can be a real random-chance downer. They can be somewhat mitigated, thankfully.  
(-) There are (beginner-prone) opportunities to make mistakes in investing in a merchant--poor evaluation of the desires of other players can result in a merchant that you have to forcibly mature on your own, which can take several runs around the rondel.  
(-) The game can drag while players are assessing which merchant to buy from the plethora that are always on display.

With 3 players, the game is very straightforward and not chaotic at all.  In fact, it felt a little too simple and it doesn't have anything interesting going on. You try to build different color stalls, you buy fish/tobacco if you can, pick stalls that give you money or point income.  That's it!  The whole firefighting thing is silly and doesn't add much.  Not bad but nothing exciting, you know exactly what you have to do, just go and execute it already!

The only drawback I felt was that it felt a bit chaotic trying to figure out what was in fact the best strategy. But after more games I suspect the balance between strategies will shake out.

I love the artwork of the game.

It has some good ideas but, for some reason, they don't work for me. All of the choices are always open there seems to be not enough competition for anything but the cards. I was expecting something more.

Provides excellent competition through the fire track and keeps randomness alive though the seasonal cards and fires.

More of a brain-burner than I imagined. Can be unforgiving at times, especially if your plans go awry (or you make a mistake). Beautiful presentation.

Lovely to look but low on control. Turn order needs serious work as do income levels. Moving last is defintely not good. Needs another spell of development.

I enjoy the flow of the game, but the mechanics aren't anything new.  The board is a little busy and the play is a bit fiddly for my tastes.  I like it better than it sounds.  Looking forward to more plays to explore the depth.

The instructions manual seems as though it is Japanese put through a cheap translation software. It is hard to understand the game, but after reading the manual twice a nice, light euro game starts to shine thorugh the darkness of the mangled rule set. 

The game itself isn't too complicated and almost seems as though some elements could have been better designed, when speaking of certain mechanics in the game. 

I was drawn to this game mostly because of it's graphics and theme and I wasn't disappointed. What did disappoint me, though is the poor balancing of the game phases and the fact that so little cards can be purchased throughout the game.

I own the Kickstarter edition with all the extras that were associated with this printing.

This game reminds me of high school. Specifically when teachers would grade a paper as an A because it followed the proper form and structure, but literally had no heart to it. It is definitely a standard light-medium weight euro.

Loved the simple shop mechanic where other players can visit your shops for no cost but your vendor improves. Some interesting choices when choosing movement.

Our first game took 3 hours. It's the worker placement and turn structure that interrupts itself twice that really hampers the flow. The complexity level does not support that for sure, but if I give it the benefit of the doubt, I still don't know what special the game brings to the table aside from the thematic trappings which have very little impact on gameplay. Yes, all the vendors have names, but they do pretty much the same thing.

I have to feed my people, roll the dice with fires, and roam the Edo market which many times was very empty during parts of the game where it really needed to be the opposite. The iconography is a bit misleading and missing, and that board is very busy to look at.

Solid, but just that.

I love, love, love this game. It offers turn angst from the very first move to the last. And then there are the fires to take into account - you never know where they will strike next season. Is it worth spending valuable actions to increase your fire fighting power in order to protect the artisans you have on the board? Or will they leave anyway because you were unable to provide them with sufficient food? Each turn offers a hard choice, as you will find that there are not enough actions to get everything you need. On top of the great gameplay and very reasonable downtime (and play length), there is the beautiful authentic artwork - rounding off an excellent package. Just make sure you download the rewritten english rules from BGG.

Ho. this is a game !!
A sort of worker placement, much more a bilding placement with a worker mooving.
Tension, hard decision, interaction between players. Very nice !
A little longer than the box says for the first game, and if you don'T manage to go up on the fireman track, think about placing your Artisans in diffrent parts of the town ! ;-)

Excellent euro. Loads of interaction but still a very peaceful and distressful game, some great strategies. Overall it flows very well and has a great length (ie. not too long, not too short). Great great game !

Finely crafted game of resource management and set collection played on a delightfully presented board that diguises a rondel-based system into a bustling marketplace. Populating the tenements by hiring artisans, represented by quirky occupation cards forms the driving activity. Worker placement visits to artisans and shopfront locations secures deals to collect or trade resources and score 'Iki' which equates to victory points. Essentially the most "hip" player wins through hiring and retiring their artisans in addition to completing various other cultural challenges that involves buying tobacco pipes or seafood and building a theatre.

A word of caution, the rules provided have been imperfectly translated from its Japanese design so be prepared to jump on this forum to divine the meaning of a few hazy texts. The uniquely presented experience with its originality in combining unusual modes of play makes this game a fun engaging series of encounters in what could easily be considered dry from any lesser medium-weight production. How 'Iki' are you? Time to find out!

Medium strategy economic market sim of 17th century Edo featuring the Nihonbashi shopping center and culture centered around fish, rice, kimonos, sandals, and saki, artisans and services like puppet masters and ear cleaning and so much more. This game has some unique, engaging, and fun game play elements. I love how the rondel is incorporated into the market square with vacant stalls that players can occupy with hired hawkers of wares and services that provide bonus benefits or actions. Great timing dynamic going through the twelve rounds of the four seasons of the year. Has a Bruge element with the threat of fire and prevention. Combined with this is a set builing and area control in the different quadrants of the market with certain types of services while trying to entice players to use your services to level up your hawker. Wow!

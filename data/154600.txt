Too simple. Felt like a kids game. Traded.

RATING: 7
Some neat mechanics for a Yahtzee-variant.  Not too challenging, and maybe some runaway-leader issues (and wildly variable cards), but it's a short and entertaining romp.  I actually like it more than [b]Dice Town[/b]!  May consider picking it up.

RATING: 5
This game has a good concept. You roll the dice matching symbols to try and break out your outlaw gang before the other player. But there are a couple things working against it. First of all is the dice. You get 4. Each has the symbol of different members of your gang on it to match up. They are cool etched dice but only having 4 of them hampers certain mechanisms in the game. There are certain matching dice rolls of 2-4 symbols that enable you to use either special abilities on outlaws already free or to get a card that gives you a benefit. The problem with these is that with only 4 dice the rolling of them to try and free your outlaws is so tight that should you decide to try and do either of these things you are going to fall behind the other players. This isn't so much an issue with the outlaws special powers which some only require one matching symbol on the dice but the cards require at least 3. Now if they had put 6 dice in the game it would not make the game so tight and it might make trying to get those cards worth it. But with only 4 ... well, the few times we played we never even tried to get a card for fear of falling behind and losing. These things combined together made Desperadoes a game wherein you MUST play it a certain way or you'll lose. Now maybe that gets mitigated with more than 2 players but it makes it not a good game for us.

RATING: 7
Light, fun and fast. Great filler or break game.
The only thing you absolutely need to know before playing is that you cannot afford to not play or underestimate the cards. In my opinion, they are usually the most powerful of your actions. And they bring more control and fun to the game.

Rating after three plays, it MAY change with more, but I can say absolutely that this is a solid 7 right now. it is more fun with 4 players, not so much with 2. it is a light fun, filler game that has some neat interactivity going for it, nice artwork and is theme appropriate. I like all the main elements of this game: dice (random = Fun in the right circumstances, like here) Player elimination, well its the wild west and is poker themed. and none of my 4 payer games went on for long (i.e. five minutes even) after the first player was eliminated. In my games also the cards while powerful have been an integral part of the over all strategy, but not essential to it, as the first game I ever played was one by one who did not play ANY cards! So it is possible. Know that this is a lighter, fun, fresh take on the genre when you are going in and wipe all expectations of EVERY other game out of your mind, and enjoy the well crafted ride that is dice town. I for one am glad I brought a copy home from Origins this year and it WILL see some play on my tables!

Its hard to think that, such good effort was made with the theme and design, and its two normally good designers, but really, if this game were anymore of a dog it would shed hair.  Basically roll dice and hope to get actions, if you dont, well ultimately you are screwed.  A definite feeling that you dont have a lot of control, and for much of the game you are a passive observer making the obvious choice presented.  Dont intent to play again (Rating 3.723, Nov 16).

Very fun, very luck-based, card game set in the Dice Town universe! We are HUGE fans of Dice Town and naturally could not pass this game up. Awesome family game that is easy to teach with some really nice components! The thick cardboard chips and custom dice are winners in my book! Piero is still king illustrator :-)

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
The game is a light and fast dice and card game.  I have found that while you are at the mercy of the dice rolls, I believe the cards are sometimes MORE important.  If no particular player has gotten lucky with their action dice, you can spend time hoarding cards and make the rolls work for you.

I also found some of the special abilities of the Brains characters to be much more powerful than others.  I think a few more plays would be in order to truly judge the subtle strategy involved.  It's not a heavy thinker because the dice and cards ultimately determine what you do on a turn, even if you had a plan in mind.

Less strategy, more luck based game, but still fun to play with more than 2 players.  I feel a 2 player game is not worth the time as this seems designed for 3 or 4 players.

It's a cool game that unfortunately goes really slow for my family's taste. I had to make house rules (when rolling the symbol of a character - spin the circle; the explosion is a wild; the rules for cards stay the same) and like this the game is less than 5 minutes but you do what you roll. The dices are small and too little (6 dices would be better). Could be better.

Played with 3 players, much more fun than I thought it would be. The artwork is excellent; however, this is the first game I've bought that I know I have to sleeve all of the cards, even the circular discs, as they seem thinner than any other game I own. IMO circular discs should have been made out of cardboard, not paper. Makes turning them and flipping them a bit difficult.

[b]Desperados of Dice Town[/b]

[i]I played this with Mat and our sons and had fun. Be warned this game is all about take that and can get a little mean. I have been looking for a light dice filler so I was really excited to play this, but I thought it took too long for what it is. There are not that many decisions to be made so playing this for 45 minutes gets a little repetitive. This may seem like an odd comment but I also thought only rolling four dice not very fulfilling; I always felt like I was missing a die.

I am glad I was able to play this before I bought/traded for it.[/i]

I hate it when they do this: they call it Desperados of DICE TOWN and they use the same artwork as Dice Town. So will you get a 'new' Dice Town? Absolutely NOT!! But off couse by putting the name Dice Town on the box, they'll know they will sell more copies.

The game itself: only 1 play, but I didn't got a wow- feeling of it. It's with dice, so sure, you'll need some luck. In this game however you seem to be really at the mercy of the dice, as you really want action-stars (you can't free your desperados without them). But with only 1 star on each die, you have only a chance of 1/6 on each die to get them. 
Also a minus is the player elimination. In my game 2 players went bankrupt quite fast, while the other 2 played a long for an other 15 minutes: that was nu fun for them.

The only reason this game is getting bad scores is because it has Dice Town in the name,  and twits are making a silly comparison.  

Look at  this game for what it is. A 25-min dice game for 8 year olds and above. If you expected deep strategy, more fool you. 

For what it is,  this game is awesome. I actually prefer it to King of Tokyo,  which to me is its closest rival. My wife loves it,  my mates love it,  my kids love it. What more can I ask for. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
When deciding to attack other players it's hard to see who you can attack (who is still in jail or not) so it's kind of fiddly in that regard. King of Tokyo has more tension and the press your luck factor is missing here. I do like the theme of Desperados better but in the end King of Tokyo is the better game so this one is going bye bye.

On paper, this game should fire King of Tokyo. It uses the same basic system (roll dice, attack other players, get useful cards) but has a unique element of breaking your gang out of jail then getting to use their abilities once they're free. I like this idea better than KoT's "you're in Tokyo, or you're not in Tokyo" approach.

The game falls short in the exact same ways that KoT falls short. Mainly, you have no control at all over the dice. Each die has six different symbols on it, there are only four dice, and one side of the die (the action symbol) is much more useful than the other sides. This means that if you don't roll those action symbols (and with only four dice you frequently won't roll them), you'll do much worse than somebody who keeps getting lucky with several action symbols. And on some turns you might be hoping to roll a certain thing, maybe a big attack that could move you toward victory, but the dice just aren't on your side even after all three dice rolls. That's just frustrating. So you basically just roll your dice three times and then see if you got lucky. No decisions to make, no planning, no push-your-luck.

Another issue is player elimination. I've seen a lot of people try to downplay the player elimination in KoT, but my experience has been that players regularly have to wait thirty minutes to an hour after being eliminated. Desperados of Dice Town, in my limited experience, seems to be a little better in this area. The eliminated players didn't have to wait more than 15-20 minutes for the game to resolve. Better than KoT, but it's still player elimination.

The player count also seems a little odd here. Like King of Tokyo, this game is best played with more players and doesn't really work with two players. Yet this game maxes out at four players. It feels like it should have went to at least five.

I was hoping for a better King of Tokyo, but I got a slightly more creative game that suffers from the same frustrating problems as KoT.

Sold.

This is yet another one of those games that I really wanted to enjoy and found myself absolutely miserable during the play of it. What a terrible game as it is made.

There doesn't seem to be a whole lot going on here. Once one player got a lead on cards they were able to use those cards to cripple the other players while simultaneously allowing them to get more cards and money.

light dice game with yahtzee mechanic, fun, "in your face", lot's of luck...

[+] cowboys! lot's of "take that", a little bit of asymetric is always good (the n°2 guy), fast paced but...
[-] ... not always short: the game usually starts fast but it can drag in the end, when everyone has 4/5 guys out but not the most money, it can take several turns to finally get a winner; player elimination or virtual-elimination can thus be a problem if the end game drags...

This game is awful.  There's only one strategy here: roll action symbols.  This is the way to win the game.  Other dice will allow you to draw cards, but most cards area waste of dice relative to the action symbols.  As such, this game is a lot like playing a game where everybody tries to roll the most sixes.  It's just atrocious.  There are lots of better dice games out there, and lots of better Wild West games out there.  Stay far away from this one.

I truly wanted this to be a fun dice romp, but it is not.
This game would be fixed if:
There were 5 dice, not 4
OR
Make all players have 1 less person to break out of jail and then the dice would have the action symbol on two sides.

I honestly feel like the mechanics are a little off. In both games I have played, it feels like no matter what you do you are absolutely at the mercy of the dice. There are zero tangible decisions to make

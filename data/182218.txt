The re-edition of Coup's ancestor. I've played only once but it seems that coup managed to get the essence of the game by getting rid of hoax's complexity. Might desserve to be better known.

We played 2 quick, 3 player games of this. I enjoyed it, but it needs more players to really shine, as most of these social deduction games do. I liked it better than Coup, which I traded away a few months ago. Will probably update my rating once we get some 5 or 6 player games in.

This one is odd because it has some very cool elements and does some things in a much more interesting way than Coup, but it's very fragile.  Poor play can end the game exceedingly early and the game doesn't offer any training wheels.  

I like how dramatic and tense it can be with the stakes being so high at times, but this also means people push the train over the cliff.

On the plus side, it doesn't suffer from that horrible end of game state Coup can drag into quite often, where you know who will win ahead of time and can't do anything about it.

An alternative to those who have played to much coup and intend to play it repeatedly. Only problem? There's not really much tying anyone to their role and calling out opponents is too high stakes. But for those with the patience to uncover it, there's a cunning game here.

Way, way better than most "lie your lying face off"/deduction games out there.

This reprint seems about as good as the original. [b]Good:[/b] more streamlined / less byzantine, investigation is stronger/brings information into the system faster. [b]Bad:[/b] Weaker thematic ties between roles and abilities / resource types, the play aids don't help with this and only show immunities in one direction. [b]Possibly terrible but maybe OK?:[/b] No role gives you two of a single type of resource (making conversion and "steal two of one type" weaker).

RATING: 8
It feels like a faster and slightly different version of Coup. I like how when someone calls Hoax on you, you only lose the ability to do that claim again instead of losing a life (or dying) like you would in Coup. Even though the two games are similar, they are different enough that I still want both in my collection.

RATING: 6
Played with 5 people.

This games instructions make it seem very long winded and difficult which is unfortunate.  It is not.  It's very straight forward and we found reading the instructions while taking turns made this very easy to digest.  It's a who-dun-it style game where people get to lie, and have to remember what people are lying about.  

At first we were hoping there would be an easier way to track the lies, but after two plays of this title we were enjoying the added difficulty of keeping track of everything.  The games went by very quick once we got everything settled, and it was a lot of fun pretending to be other characters to expedite your investigation without getting too greedy.  We had a different winner almost every game as a result of different playstyles evolving.

My note would be to read the instructions briefly, and then for the first few turn rotations to pass the instructions player to player to help grasp how simple the game is.

I'm not sure yet? It preserves the necessity of lying present in the original, which in my estimation ought to be the sine qua non of a bluffing game. I'll reserve judgment on whether this is an improvement or a step back, but so far I'm cautiously optimistic.

I was hesitant after the tepid response from Coup, but Hoax proved to be incredibly fun. The gameplay is much more structured but still has a loose feel. It almost feels like a race to figure people out before you're exposed. 

+Small, portable box
+Funny moments and fast turns
+Plays up to 6 with lots of involvement
-Deduction requires more memory skill than similar games

Esperaba mucho más de este juego. Pensaba que sería una especie de Coup, pero con mejor temática, mucho mejores ilustraciones y corrigiendo sus errores. Pero el juego no es mejor que el Coup y, por muy bonitas que sean las ilustraciones, no sirven de nada si gusta.

RATING: 8
A mixture between Coup and Cluedo.

Interesting rules and options.

The first few games ended very fast for us, since we kept accusing players in the first rounds that were not lying, causing them to win immediately...

So you need patience in this one and you need to keep in mind, that this game is not about calling a Hoax but rather finding out the true identities from other players, so you can eliminate them.

Very interesting game.

A remake of the original Hoax, it is clear that this game was a source of inspiration for the masterpiece Coup. However, unlike Coup, it is a longer game where players accumulate information. It really doesn't play all that well with 4, Likely better with 5-6 players. It overstays its welcome.

Sold on 2017-04-29.

Big surprise of a recent game night.  Was a little skeptical reading through the rules and mechanics of the game, but  a few turns in I was sold.  A really good variation on the deduction genre with some layers of double-thinking that we all became aware of as the game progressed.  For example, do you jump on calling hoax when somebody claims your identity?  Not really, but you're giving yourself away, but do you let them get away with getting more information in an investigation.

Reminded me of Mascarade. Its timing issues and player elimination didn't make the cut for me. The game can take a long time on a high player count or if everyone plays the chicken game. Explaining the Hoax vs the Accuse mechanism can be confusing. Not recommended.

RATING: 6
More accessible and faster paced then the original.  However, there are less intertwined interactions of the roles, which creates fewer situations where lots of players are caught up in interwoven lies.  Information enters the system a bit faster, which is good, and more turns get crammed into the same time frame, which is also good.  I think it's a net loss, but it really just fills a different niche.

I think a slightly better rule reminder (more icons, better cross referencing of powers) would help a lot, as would some roles that encourage collection of duplicate resources.  Several of the roles are weak because they rely on players having duplicates, which happens quite rarely with this set of powers.

But overall it is still a fun game filled with lots of outrageous lies.

Haven't played a full game yet but this seems like an interesting take on Coup. Coup is all about knowing when to bluff and when to accuse people of lying, but this game focuses more on the deduction. You build up resources just so you can investigate players and try to figure out which role they are.

You can be honest and if players accuse you of lying then you win. But the honesty can backfire and people can quickly figure out which role you are and eliminate you. Seems neat, can't wait to play a full game.

Everything I wanted from Coup and never got! A hidden roles game with surprisingly sharp teeth and a much more interesting framework for lying and bluffing. The players being able to collectively drive this game off a cliff adds a wonderful amount of tension and second guessing.

Really want to sit down for a few games in a row of this with players either already familiar with it or interested in exploring it more. I feel like the meta game that could develop around this could be exquisite.

Better than Coup for so many reasons. Voting on Hoaxes is tense, there's actual deduction, player elimination occurs toward the end of the game (if at all), and the theme is more fun. This is the small box hidden role game you want.

Komt uit begin 2017.
Werd niet gedemo'd in Essen, omdat ze ervan uit gaan dat iedereen dit kent en dat het populair genoeg zal zijn.
Materiaal is effectief wel mooier dan vorige versie.

A classic. The dice helps you more often than they screw you and add the right amount of tension and unprevisibility. And this edition adds all expansions from “To forge a realm” plus a completely new one. EXCELLENT!

RATING: 8.5
Wow, have been wanting this game for a long time but with it being out of print and the first expansion being a must buy I had to wait and I am glad this game got released with the expansion combined. I thoroughly enjoyed our first play and we did not even incorporate any of the expansion! Can only go up from here. :)

Fantastic worker placement with dice. Really easy to learn and teach but full of tough choices and strategy. The variation the extra modules add is tremendous. Highly recommended.

I own the 1st ed.  I see little much change between two.  This new one has vastly improved art work, but I don't like the light weight dice nor the itsy bitsy, medium-weight cardboard bits.  I was surprised to see these cheap cardboard tokens along with the nice wooden goods in the game.  The play has changed so little I would not buy this again, despite the beautiful artwork for which I am a sucker.

I know this is a classic. I love dice manipulation games. Sometimes design elements just can't be ignored, my board also came to me with big air bubbles in it. The new dice are cool though. Wish the game got a proper redesign; and I don't mean "better art" although that doesn't hurt.

I played one 2P game in which I did not roll higher than 11 for the first 4 rounds of the game. You roll dice 3 times per round, so for a total of 12 rolls I was unable to get higher than 11. I also rolled the dummy player dice, and I kid you not, the story was the exact same. Are you ok with this level of luck?

This may sound like a weird review, but this game reminds me of a tower defense game with resource management. You gain/generate resources to fund your defense against invaders. Very easy to teach and learn.

RATING: 7
A great worker placement dice game, with a defend the city medieval theme. The 2nd edition is a better production with better modules added in. The original has a more comical art-style. If you have the original, you dont need the 2nd edition. If you are new, buy the 2nd edition.

RATING: 6
I have to admit... in every graphical way this looks like a huge step back from the 1st edition. the artwork looks like it's from the early 90s. the graphic design is bland and uninspired. I wanted to get Kingsburg, but held off when i heard there was a 2nd edition coming. Now that i've seen the photos... I'd rather spend more on an old copy than get this edition.

Replacement

The realm of Kingsburg is under attack! Monstrous invaders are gathering at the borders, aiming to invade and plunder the realm! Your king has chosen you to take charge of a province on the border; you will manage your province and help defend the realm. To accomplish this, you must influence the King's advisors and the Royal Family to obtain gold, wood, stones, and soldiers to expand and defend your lands. But you are not the only governor seeking the aid of the advisers! The other players also seek to collect the best resources for their own territories.

German stile dice placement.
A seconda del risultato dei dadi lanciati è possibile porli sulle relative caselle del medesimo valore (o somma) ed attivarne la funzione. E' possibile ricavare materiali con cui costruire gli edifici per variare il risultato dei dadi o ottenere altri benefici durante la partita.
Il lato negativo del gioco sta nella totale dipendenza dal risultato dei dadi, con dei tiri sfortunati è molto facile non trovare più caselle disponibili in quanto già occupate o non poter occupare quelle migliori che richiedono tiri più alti.

Great game, not very difficult to learn, yet a lot strategies to think about. The art of main board is much better than the one in preview, and quality is nice. With many interesting modules, Kingsburg has a decent replay value.

I had played Kingsport Festival prior to this one, so I had that background going into this version. Kingsburg is a fun game, but it really is overlong, and feels every bit of 2 hours. As to whether I prefer this or Kingsport, I think I prefer Kingsport slightly, but I do appreciate Kingsburg for being a more streamlined and focused experience. Kingsport adds in a bunch of Cthulhu-y stuff that just serves to complicate things. If anything, I wish they would have taken some lessons from Kingsport when they did this version. Overall, Kingsburg is a game I would be happy to play, but it does feel like a bit of a slog.

規則:
*回合標記跟季節標記都放在起始格，白骰資源跟+2標記都放在對應位置，國王特使圓柱放在季節軌4跟6之前，敵人卡從各等級抽一張疊起，一在上蓋著放在圖版右下
*每個玩家拿取一個顏色所有配件跟一個圖板，一個圓形標記放武力軌0，一個放在分數軌0，一個放在順位軌
*遊戲進行五回合，每回合有八個階段
1.國王幫助，目前圖版建築最少的在春天多丟一顆白骰(平手都改拿一個任意資源不丟骰，第一輪算平手)
2.春天行動輪，分成四個步驟
>所有人一起丟骰，骰值小的順位先，使用建築物功能後再結算，平手不變
>輪流放骰，一此可放多顆到一格沒人的區域，骰和要符合該位置數字，最多只能用一組+2標記
>全部人跳過就數字小到大結算效果 拿資源換資源或增加兵力看牌等
>照順位每個人可以蓋一棟建築物，支付資源放一個建築標記到個人圖版建築物上，有分數就拿分數，每列只能左到右建
3.國王賞賜  最多建築的拿一分，平手都拿
4.夏天行動輪 同春天

6.秋天行動輪 同上
7.雇用戰士 每兩元可增加一格戰力軌
8.戰鬥 打開敵人卡最上面那張，牌背有敵人戰力分布，首家丟一顆白骰加此戰力到所有玩家戰力軌，每個玩家在跟據建築物增加戰力，每個玩家比較戰力跟敵人卡左上數字，大於獲得下方獎勵，小於結算下方懲罰，等於沒事，戰勝者總戰力最高的額外一分，之後戰士軌歸0

This is, as of right now, one of my favorite games to play. I purchased the 2nd edition of this game that included the expansion(s). Im not a huge dice rolling fan, but how its implemented in this game is just awesome. So much fun even with just 2 players. Worker placement with a battle mechanic is just great fun. Excellent component quality and beautiful artwork. I love it! Must-have for any game collection!

I'm not sure about the second edition visual look, but I did enjoy first edition Kingsburg a lot when I played with the expansion, so it may be worth taking a look at this edition.

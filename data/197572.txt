Tactically very shallow and easy. Almost non-existent decision making and character building. Maybe it is by design (to make it more beginner friendly).

That being said, it has some EXCELLENT models, though. Best ones I've ever seen by far... Also, I'd say it's very beginner friendly.

Models were a fun project and look great.
Dice/action allocation was fun.
Story bits were fun but got repetitive towards the end.
  We tried completing the game in a weekend so this may have contributed to this.

level progression not as good as original

But excited for the future.
Little story book was a quick decent read.

Although there is a steep hurdle to get past in assembling the miniatures, the game is really fast and dramatic and fun.  The skill activation mechanic is really innovative and provides some randomness without totally incapacitating your character if you roll badly.  My gaming group enjoys playing it, but I need to spend some time to paint the minis so we can get the full experience.

The game has a lot of humor and you really get yo see your friends personalities come out in how they play.  Just like in RPGs, people can be cooperative, selfish for experience, or greedy for treasure.  It's probably best to have the same group or players as much as possible as the items and skills for each character remain from game to game.  We keep the character card, skill card, dice and any other tokens for each character in a separate zip loc baggy for each character.  That way it's persistent and setup is much faster.

Replayability is a bit limited once you get through the 9(ish?) pre-designed story missions, but the encounter deck can just be randomly shuffled to replay indefinitely, but might not be as enjoyable as you would have seen all the rooms, puzzles, and bosses before.  There is a character expansion pack with cards for 40+ new playable characters using models in the Games Workshop-Age of Sigmar line of miniatures.  Each character has it own very distinct play style, so mastering each one can be a new challenge.

A 3x3 round table is probably an ideal play surface as the tiles take up a little bit of space (remember to remove tiles that no one is on) and each player needs room for their character cards and skills/items.  The bestiary for the minis for the encounters does take up a significant amount of space as well.  The GW plastic minis are not as durable as most board game miniatures, so foam or some kind of protective tray for them to remain during play and storage is a necessity.  If they get put back into the box with the heavy card components, they will get damaged.

i have refrained from writing anything on this. as i don't like jumping on ratings too quickly. but with all the prettiness that comes in the box. the game itself really lacks any form of replay-ability. the solid theme locks this down to location and monsters. struggle to see how this will advance as a franchise game. and what you get in the box has some shoddy ruling (if somewhat simple) along with a set of missions that are boring after the first 1 or 2 plays through. but a whole lot of fun the first time you play. theme is good. but also its downfall here as i'm sure future expansions will need to be huge expansions to allow the game to have a more generic feel in order to move away from tzeentch and the silver tower setting.
after finishing the 'story'. this game has'nt even wanted to be played since. which is a shame as it had so much promise. but sadly the game it's self is more of a story. and not one that is worth reading again.
so i think all the mechanics the models etc actually boil down to a pretty average game
so 5 out of 10 from me

Played a few games of this in store and it's terrible much like Age of Sigmar. I had high hopes for this and I'm now fearful about the new Blood Bowl. If they butcher it as badly as they did Warhammer Quest then it'll be another disaster. 

It's a toy not a game.

The difficulty of surviving this dungeon is on par to a trip to the walmart.  Its hectic but you should come out unscathed.  With no in depth leveling system or between adventures hijinks this one is more like babies first WHQ.  The underlying mechanics are just fine but yet again GW can not bring themselves to playtest their own games and refine them.  In no place is this more evident than the setup for the first dungeon which is both confusing and incomplete. 

In short great components, shallow game play depth and zero challenge, a terrible sin for a co-op game.

RATING: 8
Speaking as someone who hasn't played the original Wahammer Quest, I think this game is amaaazing! The story-telling in this game has gripped me unlike anything else I've experienced in a board game to date. Each card and passage from the adventure book does so much to set the scene and even rooms discovered with no monster encounters are engaging!

If nothing else, I would describe the game as elegant, you can really tell the designers made a special effort to make this game accessible! The rule book flows in a way that it's hard to miss a thing and nothing about the game feels too fiddly or tacked on to me. Even the miniatures were easy to glue together (a project I had never done before).

However, this game should be approached as something that will be lighter and fun as opposed to a game with deep character development, with that feel your level-ups make a huge difference. Items may be quick to come and go since most are one-use before they're discarded and you can only keep a certain amount of skills depending on what trial number your on, so no one can get really far ahead in power compared to everyone else.

Despite playing through some scenarios multiple times I'm still not sick of them either. There's enough variability within monster and chamber set-ups that I don't mind it at all.

Super-hoping for new expansions for tiles, items, and story! I'd snag em all up immediately!

-edited after many many more plays-

Wanted to also add that this game is particularly great for playing with players that don't really want to 'work' in their games on their free time. This dice chucker has been perfect for those types of people as well as non-gamers, while still being engaging enough for me to play with them.

Initial Impressions:
--------------------------
Overhyped for sure.  The dice allocations system is neat, and it was kind of fun to go back to the kind of games where you roll on tables to find out what happens for encounters and such.  Not sure there is enough monster variety in the box to keep the game interesting all that long, especially for the price point.  The encounter cards are neat, and it was a neat surprise every time you explored a new room.  One of the things I didn't like about descent was the "race" against the clock to do something, and with the destiny dice, you definitely have less of the "race", but I think it is too much in the opposite direction.  Since there is so much hype around this game, going to try it some more, but at this point, I cannot why people think this game is worth the price of omission.

a solid dungeon crawler in the Age of Sigmar Universe, with simple mechanics that nevertheless leave room for tactical play.

What a surprise - in every sense! The original WHQ got me into the gaming hobby back in 1994, and never did I think it could return. But, in precious hindsight, the game was extremely simplistic, lacked variety, and the roleplaying elements were so swingy - it was extremely rare to advance beyond 4th of 5th level - often through no fault of the player. 20 years later, we get this.

Fantastic model sculpts of ace-looking demons and funky little oddities. Heroes providing a sample of the new edition races. A mechanical overhaul that adds in dice value-based tactical decisions re: skills and talents. A wound system not just derived from hp (affecting number of action dice rolled). Excellent little familiar integration and personalisation. A unique way for each class to earn renown (XP)... Everything has been updated, and all for the better.

I do wish there were more female models, but that is a fault with the entire GW line. More treasure cards would also have been welcomed - particularly weapons which *could* have been easily implemented (e.g. adds an attack option, but the character may not use that and their basic attack in the same turn). But that is a negligble point, easily added in. This is - once again - a wonderful introduction to the wargaming hobby - and a solid dungeon exploring boardgame in its own right. Long may this game thrive - it certainly deserves success.

HOUSE RULE - all Area abilities of opposing character affiliation keyword (e.g. Chaos / Order) adversely affect one another, if in target room.

Finally, Games Workshop has brought back a dungeon-crawling classic! I'm a huge fan of the original WHQ game and my opinion is that they've kept what made the old version so much fun: the exploration, the easy-to-learn rules, the cool miniatures and the whole questing thingy where you play a rather unique character and level up as you push on, while also acquiring items (except you can't visit a town/village in-between adventures).

I prefer the whole action-dice system that they've now incorporated, since it adds to the decision making, providing you with a few more options on how to spend your turn as you "activate" your hero (or champion, rather), with each character having a very unique set of attacks and abilities. This also makes each wound you take more devastating as it limits the dice in your dice pool. Earning renown and leveling up is also fun and works out well.

The destiny dice with their uneventful encounters that might happen as you roll them, makes for an even more exciting game experience and keeps the players on their toes each new turn as the dice are rolled. These dice also help make up for when a player is unlucky and has a bad roll with his or her own hero dice, as they may be used in addition to your own dice.

All in all a great game which offers a lot of new, well thought out game mechanics, while still maintaining the old game's simple set of rules and straightforwardness.

Expect of the game cool events -it is really funny when you are controlling the character with the most agility while you are trying to stack some dice on the board but you really suck at it- Otherwise, it is just boring. You always page a book for events or things. Long downtime because of this. The game is quite easy too. Spectacular minis on the other hand, if you want to paint it is easily a 7 at least.

Burned again. I am never buying another dungeon crawler until I play it first ever again. 

This is dice rolling, fiddly, tedious bookkeeping with monster charts scattered at the end of the manual, outdated mechanics, bad rulebook mess of a game. 
The monster AI is terrible. Roll another dice and consult another table to resolve. Way too much dice rolling!
Why would I ever play this over one of the many streamlined engaging story driven dungeon crawlers that I already own? 
This is a system of random generated results with a paragraph book to look up some flavor text. This is outdated gameplay!

At least the miniatures are amazing!

The only complaint I'd have at this point is the difficulty, the game leans a bit towards the easy side, at least from what I have seen. With the highly random nature of the game and variety in character abilities though I'm sure there's a wide range of what can happen and I'm sure there'll be a time where it'll just hit the fan any the party will crumble. Otherwise it is true to GW's style of game with a simple core rule set filled with special rules and lots of dice to see if those special rules/events/actions work or not.

I love the dice-ability system, which promises to give each player a lot to do each turn and even some decisions about how to go about taking their actions. 

Age of Sigmar isn't something I know a lot about, and while the fantasy space marines aren't my thing I do like the 70s album cover aesthetic to the dungeon tiles. A nice change of pace from the standard fare. 

Few monsters in the basic game, as it's focused on a single chaos lord. A card-pack adds a bunch of new monsters, and a similar product expands the selection of heroes. 

The monster behavior system is interesting in theory, but kind of clunky in practice. Doubly so if you're using the book to keep track of stuff, as is requires constant flipping back and forth. 

Some interesting mechanical innovations, but I think other dungeon crawlers are actually more fun to play. Still, can be a blast with the right group.

WHQ was my very first boardgame 20 years ago and this version is a real modern implementation of the old classic. I like how this can be full coop or old fashioned nagging and thieving from each other!

It is no surprise that this game looks gorgeous. The miniatures are of course the best I miniatures I have seen in any game, but the rest of the game looks good as well. The tiles are all beautiful and all the artwork is vibrant and colorful.

The game is pretty easy to learn, teach and play. This is evident by the low number of components it has, just 3 stacks of cards and a handful of tokens. It feels very streamlined and I didn't have to look up any rules after the first few rounds.

The game itself isn't very heavy, I'd say on the same level as Zombicide which is good for the type of game it is. It is very thematic and I like the passage and story elements each time a tile is explored. Also like the little mini-games some tiles contain. 

but at it's core it is still a pretty mundane exercise. You enter a room, kill everything in it and move on. The randomness of the game does spice everything up but then the lookup tables drag it down again. Having to look up every enemy action really takes you out of the game again.

It's a mixed bag that is fun to play for the first hour and after that it begins to drag and becomes a bit of a chore. I really want to love it though.

I love the core mechanics of the game. The way dice are used is great, especially compared to a duller system like Dead of Winter.
BUT, the Games Workshop horribleness, like putting all the monsters in a difficult to use book, makes actually playing tough. The enemy AI is more dull than I first thought it would be. And the constant referencing of the book for events, even though they generally do very little, was plain boring. This added up to the game taking far longer than it had any right to.

Holy crap that's expensive. Let's hope this isn't the usual splash release and we see some expansions. The minis are really nice though.

I looked in the LGSs demo copy of this and couldn't seem to figure out why the price tag was so high. Sure the models are GW but that's not enough to justify the amount of them and materials in the box for that much.
I feel my money is better spent elsewhere as I can get twice as much game from any other company for the same price. It's not GW but that's never really mattered to me anyways.

Easier to get into and just generally more enjoyable for much less work than its predecessor.  It's no longer trying to be a full-fledged RPG, which is both a good thing and a bad thing.  There's very little loot gathering or character progression, but bookkeeping is non-existent.   The new art style is colourful and refreshing, and the miniatures are absolutely top-notch.   Usually drags on too long, especially for a game that's quite linear and lacking in tactical decisions.

Why is this called Warhammer Quest? It has nothing to do with the game.

Warhammer Quest is a deep replayable game with tons of creatures in the basic box... well, pretty much everything that can be found in the Old World from a giant rat to major daemons. Also, you could play many times and each time would be different.

Silver Tower, note that I am not putting WQ before it since it has nothing to do with that, is a game almost purely based on luck and there is no strategy and zero replayability. Once you have gone through the game, it's over. So there is why it is not Warhammer Quest, you cannot continue with the same characters over dozens of adventures like the real deal.

This is yet another game that tarnishes the Warhammer Quest name like that crap Fantasy Flight got out and that poor, ridiculous and failed video game adaptation by Rodeo Games.

Why do you need a license like that to publish your game? Is it because it is not good enough to be sold on its own, it needs a big name like Star Wars, Warhammer, Dungeons & Dragons to sell? I don't get it, where do you see Warhammer Quest in your game? There is absolutely nothing of that game in Silver Tower...

And that is the main reason that I give this game a 3 out of 10, due to lies about this being Warhammer Quest, the second reason is that it is a poor game system and mechanics that we have seen before and it sucks as replayability and playability since the player's decisions have little impact on the game itself.

This game is HIGHLY OVERRATED by the BGG community. People vote high for games with miniatures, which proves most of them are superficial and don't know what good mechanics are. Seems Games Workshop needs some big fishes to buy their SUPER OVERPRICED games.

Pues es uno de los juegos que cuando se fue al diablo el acuerdo entre GWS y FFG, el juego paso a ser "most wanted". Aunque en este caso concreto, el juego no tiene nada que ver con FFG, es un juego de GWS de los que ellos llaman "juego especialista" (un juego que se basa en sus licencias de wargames de miniaturas pero que es un juego cerrado). 

Es un hack n'slash en el que haces lo tipico: explorar mazmorra, conseguir tesoros, patear el culo a bichos, etc. tiene algo de desarrollo de juego de rol (personajes arquetipicos y cierta evolucion de los mismos, exploracion de las salas - en este juego llamadas "camaras" -). 

Tiene mucha tirada de dados. tira para ver que acciones puedes hacer, tira para ver si la accion tiene efecto, tira para ver el efecto de la accion... todo con los d6 chiquititos de parchis que le gusta usar a GWS para todo. el desarrollo esta bien llevado una vez te acostumbras, pero de entrada comparado con otros juegos del genero es un poco lioso, sobre todo si estas acostumbrado a descent. 

Las minis es de lo mejor del juego. muy detalladas (son un poquito delicadas). de lo mejor del mundillo hay que decir. estan a 3/4s de camino entre el warhammer de toda la vida y otros juegos de mesa de minis. 

Es un muy buen juego y aporta bastantes cosas diferentes a otros mazmorreos (descent, cmon, etc). 

Entre los defectos... para mi quiza el mayor defecto es que la traduccion es regulera (hay muchas cosas directamente sin traducir, porque GWS tiene la "buena" costumbre de no traducir las palabras clave en sus manuales de juego). 

Le doy un 8 muy largo. yo particularmente prefiero descent pero este es un excelente juego y no le diria que no a una partida en ningun momento.

As a narrative gamer this is just the one for me! Easy ruleset and meaningful decisions made this my top Dungeon Crawler. Amazing miniatures too, which I love to paint. Price point is high and the variation on adversaries are not that big - only down points for me so far!
Great product - Didn't believe GW could produce boardgames for my tastes after Space Hulk and here we are. Pleasantly surprised.

The rulebook? Complete shit.  Poorly organized, bad grammar, vague hanging sentences, and dangling modifiers.  Don't believe me check out the various BGG forums where the rules lawyers debate for pages over what should have been very basic instructions.  Doesn't scale well with two players.  We just started using two characters each in order to survive.  The idea of the fate dice is great but during my last play the party was down to one person and it took twenty two turns before we gave up.  No exaggeration, every turn we rolled the fate dice and got double ones or double sixes and we had to have a random encounter that brought on between three to six new creatures, or worse a super monster who eventually wiped out the last guy.  It felt like Ground Hog Day on LSD mixed with Fifty Shades of Grey (without any of the benefits).  I love assembling miniatures (how many on BGG say that) and after assembling four 3,000 point plus Warhammer 4th edition armies (including the Dark Elves, as well as four very large Warhammer armies,  even I found some of these models a pain in the butt to assemble.  They are so small, fragile and thin that even pinning was difficult.  I had to find very thin metal from the art store and use a super fine drill and even then on one  of the models I had to sand down the first attempt because the diameter of the drill bit was too wide and slipped.  For those that say this game is too easy....I am willing to bet you didn't play it correctly.  You can only have four treasures at one time, you can only have four skills at one time.  Yes if you try to do a respite with too many skills you will never heal and will be ambushed, but you can ditch skills that don't benefit you.  Besides, there are so many things that force you to ditch skills that it is unlikely you will have that many from quest to quest.

Having played a full campaign of Silver Tower, I think it definitely did more things right than wrong.  I liked the presentation of the Silver Tower as its own character, the incorporation of some minor puzzle elements into the paragraph narrative, and the generally clean mechanics.  On the other hand, by the time we finished the campaign, I had gotten very sick of the limited enemy pool and the final mission was oddly unchallenging, as if the designer had just not accounted for how strong our characters were by that stage.  

Also, much like the original Warhammer Quest, you can get into this seemingly endless spiral of bad luck and just bog down killing things in a room for 40 or 50 minutes of rolling dice and doing very little of anything else.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Pretty good dungeon crawler.
Now let me first state in advance that I did not assemble and paint the minis beforehand. I never really make time for painting these days and didn't feel up for it ths time either. And yet I still had fun.
If I included the minis in my score it probably would've scored higher. But then again I'm kinda ignoring the very steep price...

This is one of those games that thrives on making you feel awesome. Stuff happens and you smash your way through. Sometimes you curse bad luck/dice rolls but things are definitely skewed in your favor so it should be fine.

So yeah.

Highlight of the game is definitely the heroes so I strongly recommend picking up that Hero Card expansion. This gives... 43 or so options instead of the 6 that come with the base game.
That being said, I love the Mistweaver Saih mini that comes with the base game. So awesome.

The game looks beautiful - on paper that is! You have to paint it yourself :) Still the models are the best you can get. The premium price gets you that.

Unlike Space Hulk and Blood Bowl 2016 (produced by Games Workshop as well) the models are not push fit (easy to assemble, no glue required), feature many small parts (up to 16!). That means  that if you decide to glue them first and play a couple of games they will be harder to paint (because you can't disassemble hard to reach parts). So I decided not to glue them but I can't play the game until its painted now. 

The manual is actually better than that from Blood bowl. Rules are referenced to specific page and the layout makes clear distinction of separate rules. 

Haven't played the game yet. I will adjust the score.

I liked the original Warhammer quest and the FFG card game but this does a much better job of creating strange and surreal adventures. I love the writing style of the flavor text and the art style. The dice mechanic isn't revolutionary but makes what would normally be a random dice fest into a game with very interesting decisions. 

Plays extremely well solo and is very easy to adjust the difficulty. This is right up there with Kingdom Death for my favorite new miniature (exploration) games. So glad GW is taking chances and trying new things...

My biggest problem with most dungeon crawls is the set up time. They did a great job of simplifying the components to make setup fast and easy.

- [i]Extraordinary[/i] quality of the models, overall ok materials
- coherent artwork & story arch that links a whole 9-scenarios campaign;
- random dungeon building, enemies, loot & skills gaining;
-  simple yet fun-looking system full of different and (to me) interesting things to do (including minigames): not only a mindless carnage, but there's actually some interaction with the world;
- full co-op with random but paragraph based enemy AI

On the cons: 
- the books are a bit chaotic (... because Tzeentch I guess)
- rules are scattered and admittedly vague ("runemarked decides" is somewhat lazy), without an index
- the lack of specific characters growth is a tad annoying
- luck is heavily present: be prepared
- for the price, I'd have expected some more skills and treasure cards honestly

Overall I like it, it's [i]quick and fun[/i], there's definitely some polish work needed but the system is open enough to be easily modded.

If HeroQuest was more like this game I would play HeroQuest more.  Very enjoyable dungeon crawl game based in the Warhammer Fantasy Universe.  The game component quality is high and the mechanisms are pretty simple to wrap your head around.  The inclusion of traditional Warhammer style minis makes the presentation better while also giving you more armies for Age of Sigmar.  If you are not into the idea of cutting and gluing minis stay away, but if you like it check this out.

PRE-ORDERED in GW store => immediately received 10 foil hero cards (6 the same as in the box, 4 extras) + 1 more bonus hero card sent out with the game itself + badge + heavy rune token.
WHEN RECEIVED => was quite extensive damage to the cards/tiles/rulebook from the sprues, and a couple of broken figures, but GW arranged for replacements to be sent to local store :)

This is a fairly light dungeon crawler which doesn't require a DM. A nice blend of 80's/90's nostalgia (rolling on encounter & behaviour tables, D6's galore) and some more modern elements. Can be very random, with high variation in difficulty depending on spawns and the luck of the dice. I like the way the Adventure Book works, and actually quite enjoy the theme, a nice change from the usual dungeon/fantasy settings.

Differs in many ways from the original (which is supposed to have a very dated design/gameplay now). I see many similarities with Descent 2nd Ed (probably the closest in gameplay that I own), despite claims that D2e isn't a dungeon crawler (though now D2e also has an app & generated dungeons, though not random). Perhaps WHQ:ST doesn't (yet) have the depth & breadth of eg. Descent 2nd Ed, but may be more approachable & better suited to occasionally dipping into for shorter periods. There's an 'Adventure Book' in the game which may eventually lead to reduced fun/novelty on repeat plays due to secret information ("don't read this until instructed"), once you've played out most of the scenarios, "Choose Your Own Adventure" style!

Components are excellent, although the Guide Book could have been a little clearer in places - hopefully an official FAQ/errata is forthcoming!

The miniatures took way longer to assemble than I expected (I was very picky about cleaning up rough spots!) I would have been just as happy with lesser-quality figures, being more of a boardgamer than a toy soldier collector. Regardless, I look forward to painting them... something I haven't done for a long while.

Sounds like there may be expansions planned, or at least the capability to use various other minis from GW's AoS line, eg. the bonus hero cards, and the base game includes rules for another 4 types of bad guys. Having checked out the prices on the minis for the 4 or 5 heroes that have pre-order bonus cards, I'm seriously hoping for bundles/packs of some sort that offer better value in future, or better still, proper boxed/themed expansions. Otherwise I'll probably just stick with the content supplied with the base game.  [UPDATE: got my wish, GW releasing a 'Might Heroes' pack with 4 of the pre-order bonus minis - much better value, but still relatively expensive for 4 figures. Wouldn't be surprised if it's followed by a pack of the monsters which have rules in the game but no minis.]

There is a companion app to track things (hero etc.), with inevitable expensive in-app purchases to unlock stats for more heroes + some extra Treasure & Skill cards. I can't imagine it will be much fun flicking through pages on an app, versus having physical cards, so I would much rather GW release physical card versions of any additional content (again, preferably as part of proper boxed expansions).

RATING: 8
Pretty simplistic dungeon crawler that can be played purely cooperatively.  I like the combat system and the randomness of rolling the fate dice at the beginning of each round.  There's a lot of narrative events that can happen and these events range from just monster encounters to dexterity games.  This game is MUCH easier with more characters rather than less.

Let's start off by saying that I really, really like this game. The components are excellent and the game itself is really well made. The card stock is great, as well as rulebooks, tokens and etc. The story is very immersive and that the adventures are great.

However, this game has some drawbacks. Price point is astronomical. 150$ USD is a lot to pay for a dungeon crawl. You do get really nice minis but we're board gamers and we are fine without them honestly. The tables for all respective monsters are on different books and are on different pages. I wish that GW provided more reference sheets on this. I wanted this game to be a little longer for it's price. The expansion does NOT come with hero cards which is a complete oversight that annoys me quite a lot.

23-07-2016. Rated after 5 plays. Warhammer Quest: Silver Tower is a redone version of Warhammer Quest (1995). 

While WHQ:ST is not perfect, it's a very fun and interesting miniatures game with a novel dice system. 

Turn structure is easy:
1. Destiny phase. You roll the hero dice. These are 5 shared dice that can be used for hero actions. If any doubles are rolled, random stuff happens that you have to determine based on the quest book..

2. Hero turn's. Each hero rolls their 4 dice. They can subsequently use those dice to use actions. If you rolled a 1+ result, you can move, (basic) attack, explore. Higher dice results get you nicer abilities. You can use the destiny dice in order to spice up your own turn. Nice. When you attack, you'll have to flip through the manual quite extensively to find the charts.

3. Enemy phase. All enemies attack, using charts and activation patterns that are triggered by a die roll.

4. End of turn. Tiles drop of if it's more than 2 tiles away from the tile with most heroes. Otherwise it's good.

All-in-all I really like this game. It's one of the first truly cooperative dungeon crawlers I know. Compared to Shadows of Brimstone which took WHQ and put it in Cthulhu-Western, WHQ:ST improved on WHQ in my book. I like the action dice system. I like the models. I like the tiles. I like the stories. I might like Descent II - APP coop better. But WHQ: ST is excellent in it's own right.

Games Workshop manages to bring back one of its most beloved lines, and in doing so it shakes up the dungeoncrawl genre. This is a vibrant game, with lots of narrative detail and creative solutions to ongoing problems with games like these. The narrative framing for the campaign allows for a game that doesn't require all of the same players for every session, and the semi-random dungeon generation feels right at home in the halls of the Gaunt Sorcorer. This is a terrific game, and one of my favorite fantasy games in recent years.

Not as deep as I would have liked. The mechanics of the game are pretty simple and the story telling is pretty light. The models and art are great and the gameplay is fun enough.

Some fun here, but a lot of bad and outright lazy design. Not enough skills (we ran out the deck in quest 4 out of 9). Terrible flavor text. Constant look-up of events (which are usually really dumb). Ambush/Respite mechanic is badly thought out; later on in the campaign it becomes impossible to recharge abilities or bring back a grievously wounded hero. Makes it wise to simply let a grot or something live and follow after you; the continual attacks won't be as serious as an ambush.
Special events nearly every turn (90% of the time) are just too much (and too much time spent looking stuff up).
Monster formatting is terrible; stat cards with info in a more manageable format are practically a must.

Models look nice, but a few are very hard to assemble.

Probably some salvageable stuff in here with houseruling, but a grinding bore with not enough variety out of the box.

Also, 1 female character out of 10 is dismal even by the lousy standards of fantasy adventure games.

Silver Tower is not a game with a good design: it's not really challenging, too much impacted by dice and without a real narrative immersion. The cards are not illustrated and the gameplay is reduced to rolling dice and moving forward. 
On the other hand it's one of the most beautiful minis out there.

The game has plenty of potential! Beautiful miniatures and boards with plenty of nice mechanics. If only the quality of the rules matched the quality of the models! Too many times the rulebook tells you to refer to page XX which contains an obscure reference to a rule which doesn't exist. How hard is it to have an index or contents page!? The rules let what could be an excellent game down! 
Overall it has a feel of a game that can only let you experience it's full potential if you are prepared to fork out for the extra expansions. £95 is just too much to ask for a game with clunky mechanics due to a poorly laid out rulebook with a finite list of heroes and bad guys.

Haven't yet played it, but the components are top notch, especially the promo stuff...and the models are awesome!

(update 5/23/16) Played through a couple of the first missions...it is a dungeon crawl that is light/medium in weight, with streamlined rules, which is something I was looking for.  Of course, the miniatures are awesome, with rules to bring in other heroes (using the app for now).  If the rumors are true, and GW expands on this game with rules for other monsters/heroes as well as some other locations, my rating will go up.  As of right now, this was everything I was looking in a Dungeon Crawler...lighter, fast, fun, with awesome components!

Since I am a big fan of the original Warhammer Quest, I was looking forward to giving its sequel a try. And there is a lot to like here: the miniatures are beautiful (even though they are very fragile), the dice allocation system works VERY well and the dice rolling feels nice and streamlined. There is no longer a need to cross-reference weapons skill, and then roll separately for toughness. Just choose your weapon and roll the to hit value associated with it, regardless of which foe you are trying to hit. And yet, when compared to the original, there is something missing: the game feels even more random and less tactical. This has to do with the way the monsters are placed when exploring a new room. In the old game, you really had to think about your position relative to the monsters and your allies. You would know up front how the monsters would be distributed among your heroes. This need to tactically position your party for each encounter has been removed, making the game less interesting and frankly a little bland in my book. Overall, I find it hard to recommend the game over its predecessor, as it does not add anything worthwile to my gaming collection. I would not mind playing the game again in the future, but would not suggest it and would rather play the superior original.

Great minis and fun game play! Refreshing setting breaking apart the too many times used "dungeon in the sewers" theme.

strong replayability, easy to follow/ streamlined rules, fun random event generator, fun coop game with friends. The major downside is the difficulty. For the most part it is too easy.

Playing this solo.  I really enjoy the theme, exploration, flavor text, and randomization this game provides.  It is definitely a dice chucking, murder fest.  I knew that going in through. 

One map tile has you stack dice in order to see if you make it through a narrow bridge.  Falling dice deals you damage.  I enjoy little treasures like this.

The game uses Claustrophobia like dice rolls where you decide your actions based on the dice roll you perform.  

The game can be very "swingy" and I feel as if my actions are usually limited to 1 or 2 attacks.  I'm assuming with more plays, skill cards will help with this.

Just played a 3 players game it was a blast.  A fun, easy to play experience that everyone enjoyed.  The group loved it and wants to play again.

Solid dungeon crawl co-op game. One of my favorite themes. The minis are fantastic as is the art overall. I don't like the room tile art though as it doesn't feel "dungeony". It captures the RPG feel with the scenario book which will slow down the game quite a bit. Overall an enjoyable game though getting people to commit to a campaign would be pivotal to get the most from it

Light and streamlined dungeon crawler. At first I was a bit bummed that there were so few (non-miniature) bits compared to, say, Descent 2nd edition, but as we played, this turned out to be refreshing. It remains to be seen how much replayability Silver Tower has, this also depends on what kind of support Games Workshop will provide (expansions, additional tiles, quests, etc.). One negative thing I noticed: You spend a bit too much time looking stuff up in the two booklets. Check the monster stats: Page X. Read the unexpected event: Page Y. Etc. 

This game would not be interesting for people looking for a heavy dungeon crawler with a detailed level-up system and lots of treasure collecting. Although there are skills and experience, the system is quite light and the treasure is mostly "use and forget" items.

Macht wirklich Riesen Spaß, bis jetzt allerdings immer nur zu 4 gespielt. Demnächst mal zu zweit. Das Spiel ist in 5 Minuten erklärt und somit für keinen eine Abschreckung. Die Miniaturen Qualität ist wie immer überragend, die des Rest Materials natürlich auch.
Bin gespannt was den Langzeit Spielspass angeht. Klare Kauf Empfehlung, auch wenn der Preis erstmal abschreckt für ein Brettspiel.
Ich hoffe das die Spielkarten der neuen Helden und die die noch rauskommen nicht nur über die App laufen sondern auch physisch erhältlich sind.

Powerful characters, but so are the opponents. Action selection using the dice works well.

My favorite co-op dungeon crawl. Fantastical looking, wonderful mini's (which I'm considering putting down some good money to get the done up gold-standard quality) and solid game design with only a few hiccups (but it's GW which is rather amazing, IYAM).

Co-op fantasy role playing miniature game (assembly and painting required) on modular boards of a vivid fantasy setting unlike any other.  Eight trials the heroes face before they confront the boss.  Story telling element as the tower reacts to the heroes' progress. But, not for me.  I don't like to assemble and paint and when I role play I prefer old school.

Fun enough. I appreciated the Destiny Dice, d6 dice assaults, stack-splitting, and off-kilter flavor text.

But why you'd want to spend $100+ on Silver Tower is beyond me, particularly when you can collectively purchase [i]Space Cadets: Away Missions[/i], [i]Warhammer Quest Adventure Card Game[/i], and [i]Welcome to the Dungeon[/i] for the same amount of cash.  Even less, I think.

SC:AM has Silver Tower beat on all fronts, so really this is a no-brainer.

RATING: 7
Extremely beautiful presentation.
Quick to set up, learn and put away. Nothing heavy about it. Some good references to earlier Warhammer Quest such as the random events, dungeon deck, the familiars who are from older book illustrations.
Negative points: superfluous elements, such as the board to keep track of xp or the "portals". Combat is extremely simple. On paper, the elements of enemy ai and action sound great, in reality, there is so little space on the board that enemies clump and mostly use the same actions over and over. Heroes simply open and door and kill every monster they see while monsters wait patiently for their clumsy, inefficient actions. Some strange mini-games are inserted here and there but they are mostly awkward (make a pile of dice?)
Overall gorgeous but slightly unexciting to play. I may change opinions after a campaign. Innovative elements (activation dice and wound interaction, monsters special rules makes them feel unique and different, random moments are very random, maybe too much so)

First game was too easy, monsters go down too quickly.
Love the behaviour of the monsters and different weapon attacks.
Good narrative element and great dungeon exploring. 
System with dice works well. Quick gameplay.

Rating after two games. Refreshing action economy and wound tracking, immersive narrative and surprises made this a tremendously enjoyable gaming experience.

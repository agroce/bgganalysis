Initial view ona solo run through. More "take that" than I'd like normally, but in the context of the game it did not seem as bad as I'd feared. It has some interesting ideas - city growth, CDG, card banking, roles that make the game worth exploring in more detail.

There's everything to like in this game especially that it's a card-driven, multi-player city building game that plays in a reasonable time frame.

RATING: 7
Forged in Steel (FiS) is a card-driven war game (historical theme and all) mashed up with a euro-style city-builder. It's a bold design. FiS doesn't overly simplify the city-building (there's still a large collection of adjacency scoring bonuses), and does enough with the events and headlines to feel like a fully card-driven game. The fact that both systems are fleshed out can slow down game play, and a minimum of 2 hours for each game should be expected.  Also, I've only played this with the variant that delays Mayor scoring until the next election.

FIS offers multiple strategic paths and many ways to affect your opponents as you move forward. The events seem well-balanced in that it is commonly better to use them in a positive way (e.g., as municipal muscle) as opposed to an attack on your opponent (e.g., for a seize or remove event). Still, if a player makes themselves too big of a target, he or she should be prepared to have owned buildings wrecked. The game offers each player plenty of space to allow for sly and clever play.

There's a lot to like here and I enjoy the mash-up of city-building and card-driven mechanisms much more than I expected. But some of the edges to the overall package could have been refined. The rough edges feel mostly due to a lack of version control in the cards and player aid, and the organization/writing of the rule book. This isn't to say that the rule book is bad--the rules are there and the game is very playable--but it seems to invite the search for ambiguity. Some further polishing, or a much better player aid, could have smoothed out game play a lot.

One look at the Industry Leader cards tells much about this title - cartoonish.   Any notion that it constitutes CDG industry-building - some sort of mashup of Sword of Rome and Le Havre - is just silly; it contains an iota of the depth of those games.

Rating increased after second play. This game has the potential to be a star. It looked finished except for a few clarifications on cards and rules. Now only needs a publisher to pick it up and give it fancy bits. Theme is certainly integrated. I love the mob, riots, fire and flood options for screwage.

RATING: 9
A really mean euro, when you get to build a city and then send the mob to destroy it afterwards.

This game has a vibe similar to Terraforming Mars: you play cards and place stuff on a grid. But, unlike Terraforming, in which direct attacks are few and hard to come by, here you have pure, unaltered, raw conflict. More than half the cards have really devastating effects for your opponents.

To sum up: if you like euro games and direct conflict, this game is for you.

This game is great!  Card driven makes for some great strategic gameplay.  Couple that with a great physical representation of the city.  So much fun to come up with a strategy based on the cards you get and watch the city physically grow according to that strategy.

Designer so I have to rate it high. New tweaks and playtesting have been very successful in terms of gameplay and balance!! I feel the ops and card distribution are pretty much complete.  The card balance and interplay is another daunting undertaking. So far though games have been pretty close, and players have regulated one another: not the game. 

 Cards rebalanced. New interactive cards added such as "Beer" "crime syndicate".  Weight of low OP cards improved.  Farms eliminated and families balanced seriously to avoid some weird situations and unbalanced play.

Player aid revamp-done. Cards almost finished.
Next up nice player aids and a decent looking PDF map.  Looking to start finding play test groups globally. Must enjoy interaction and open to a card driven game and some initial complexity.  Still, about 5-6 non card driven gamers have picked it up after one round or one game. 

Working out the card text & streamlining the text to make it easy to understand. Some great feedback about a "build up" game where you could start with a small and simple deck and add complexity.

Looks like I have some friends to help with some graphics and editing. 

NEWS: Almost done with major card clarification/map edit. Ready to send two more requested copies out 10/2009
Played 2 games at BGG Con 2009 and had a blast, a few more copies need to go out now.

I am hesitant to rate Adobe, Stone, and Steel because it is in prototype form, but I found this game to be intriguing enough that I will be playtesting it for the designer. I highly recommend that individuals who are fan of card-driven games and euros check it out, as it appears to be an excellent hybridization of the two.

I've only playtested the game.  Very cool empire building CDG.  It is an empire building game that takes the genre to new levels. If Wade can make the game I see here, the visual element alone will look very cool.  Players actually build a small Colorado town in a very thematic way. From it's humble beginnings the town grows with the help of CDG strategies.  Wade is still in the process of cleaning it up,but I definitely think it's exciting, and my rating will go up when it's finished.

RATING: 7
Tentative rating is a 7 for now.   Has the potential to be an "8" for me.  But, the core of the game is there, and it's good.   It's essentially a multi-player CDG with the theme of developing a city thru industrial revolution.  It's not as much of a wargame as say Twilight Struggle, but that's the closest comparison.  The theme here is tightly woven into the game, and unlike anything I've seen before, so I give it a lot of credit for that.  It has quite a lot of potential assuming it gets cleaned up, and it will be interesting to see how it evolves if/when it gets published.

RATING: 7
This has potential to be an excellent card driven game. The theme and content is well researched and unique, though perhaps not appealing to everybody. There are lots of options to choose from, and your strategy is not necessarily determined by your cards. Will take more plays to improve on me as it will take time to understand the different card combinations.

There is a ton to like about this game, particularly the willingness and dedication to reveal history and card play/drafting... I hope the designer continues to make more games.  The graphic design, anti-fun mechanics, the connection from role play to actions, scoring... are questionable though.

Some very interesting clever mechanics, but an awfully written rulebook that needs an errata on just about everything. Nothing much is clear in building or scoring.

Tactically it seems simple enough, pick whatever strategy synergises your cards together and hammer it as hard as you can.

The good: A lot of interesting things going on -- particularly fun hand management and player interaction. I like the unusual theme and watching the town grow, and I love the cards as historical events.

The bad: Too many things going on. Too many rules. Too long. So many ways to score points that scoring is long and tedious, and it happens three times. Twilight Struggle is super-streamlined in comparison.

Provisional rating 8 based on playtest version.  Adobe, Stone, and Steel is a new take on the CDG genre.  While Founding Fathers extended the genre to light multiplayer non-wargames, Adobe, Stone, and Steel does the same but with a medium-heavy weight.

The design is clearly crafted with love.  I was taught by the designer who is a city planner, and the game has the players balancing realistic city planning concerns against the backdrop of early 20th-century Pueblo, Colorado.  At heart the game is about harvesting points from building and buying residential, commercial, and industrial buildings, and through special events on the cards.  There is also an interesting subgame concerning the mayoral elections and the victory points from those elections.

There is a riot mechanic that is very much reminiscent of the war mechanic in Rio de la Plata, though undoubtedly developed independently.  I think the riot mechanic works much better here than in the new Essen release however, as a riot doesn’t have the potential to completely cripple a player like the wars do in Rio de la Plata.

Our playtest group was concerned that the final scores were so close that the differences were more attributable to random noise than player skill.  I’m actually more concerned that the powerful events and high-ops cards may be too much of a determining factor.  But Twilight Struggle has had the same criticism leveled against it and seems to have weathered it just fine.  Sacrificing strict Euro standards of balance at the expense of thematic richness is a well-established tradeoff for the CDG genre.

I hope to see this game published someday.  I’ll certainly make sure someone in my game group owns it if it is.

Good game, one of my favorite heavy euros ever. Even if there is an aggresive mechanism (you can take over another players building by using 4 AP), an agressive role (mob, roll the D4, and take away so many houses in one block) and agressive cards (riots, eg. take away houses anywhere in one district).

Grym theming i spelet. Och en hel del historiskt fluff (typ som i The Underground Railroad). Också begränsat antal rundor, 3 stycken. Och i varje runda spelar man 5 kort. Card driven, en mekanik jag gillar, och där man, likt TS och andra, väljer att använda AP:t på kortet eller eventet. För AP kan man mut in tomt, bygga hus, affär, fabrik (om det är fabrikstomt), eller en manson. Varje runda är som en era, och för varje era blandar man in nya kort (det görs alltså 2 gånger). Korten i era 3 (de röda korten) är så awesome.

Forged in Steel is a game about the founding and building of Pueblo, Colorado from 1890 - 1920. The cards are steeped in interesting historical theme and really highlight the advantage of this kind of system when basing a game on actual historical events. The board divides Pueblo into 5 neighborhoods and each neighborhood has a different number of lots to build on. Players use cards to buy lots and mines, build houses, mansions, factories, commercial buildings, civic buildings, hospitals and parks. Players can also seize other player's buildings and cause unrest that can lead to rioting and one player targeting another to burn their buildings down. The game is played over 3 eras (5 cards per era) and there is a scoring each era for each type of building with possible multipliers and adjacency bonuses. Also, dominance of houses in a neighborhood gives a player a voting block that can help elect the Mayor for the next era. The mayor role gives additional points for building on city land and can act as a tie-breaker in the next election. Most points after eras wins.

One of the weaknesses of the CDG system, in my opinion, is the advantage given to a player who knows the deck really well and can better plan for expected combos. Forged in Steel avoids this by only having about half the deck in play for any given game. Also, each era players "bank" cards that can be used in later eras, granting an ability to plan for cards you know you will have the option to pick up later in the game. Selecting cards to use and save and being able to build a strategy across multiple eras is really what makes this game so good. There are a few potential downsides - the scoring drags a bit, it takes some effort to teach building rules that aren't always followed, it can be a bit too hard to unseat the Mayor with his tie-breaking power - but they are minor and my table of experienced players had no problems getting up to speed and playing competitive quickly. The direct attacks can shift a majority and deny a few points, but they are more about jockeying for position than ruining someone's plan entirely, which is how it should be. This is a very good title worth exploring.

This is a luckfest dressed in a heavy Euro costume. Decisions are few and meaningless, given that they are surrounded by layers upon layers of randomness. Worse than the randomness is the gratuitous take that aspect, which is funny in a 10 min game, less so in a 3-hour one. Even the socalled depth is actually intertwined webs of shallow but confusing mechanisms which give you the impression of strategy where there isn't.

Components are nice though.

Great mix of card play, area control, city building and a bit of role selection. Players collectively develop the city of Pueblo Colorado while simultaneosly fighting for control of the neighbourhoods and industrial development of the budding city. Seeing the city take shape throughout the three eras is great, and the multitude of scoring options and strategies makes for tough decisions each time you have to choose your 5 cards for the round. With only 3 rounds and 5 cards played per round you definitely want to make each action count. There is a ton of player interaction on the board and this game will definitely not appeal to folks who shy away from player conflict in games. The game looks great on the table and seeing the city you built at the end of the game is rewarding.

RATING: 8
Excellent game. A lot of interesting decisions. And a cool mix of mechanisms. I especially enjoyed the unique drafting system where players need to decide which cards to keep, save for the following round and discard. The area majority is also a cool feature, where players with majority in the various neighborhoods gain votes which will determine player order for the upcoming round. What didn't work for me was that each round was dictated by cards that are distinct to that round and with each successive round those cards add more conflict between the players. By the last round it feels like a full on war game. 

A very well designed and interesting game but not for me.

I've now played three times.  Sort of.  First session was a complete game, and I was impressed.  It was slow, but I didn't care.  In hindsight, I know we got a few rules wrong.  But we got enough correct to get a good feel for the game.

This is a game of direct player interaction.  I can build on your lots, burn your houses, and even target you as the riot victim.  So if you dislike direct "puss" type games, beware.  But even so, a lot of energy is spent on building the city of Pueblo.  Where to direct your positive energy?  Mines, houses, commercial buildings, mansions, civic buildings, hospitals, parks...  Lots here to consider.

With my second game I learned the lesson that positive energy trumps negative energy.  I had a lot of fun destroying stuff.  But I lost badly.  I also learned that you must pay attention to the Headlines - they swing the game towards rewarding certain behaviors.  NAd another lesson I learned from the second game was that this game can run too long, with teaching, to comfortably fit into one our weeknight game events.

My third game was a teaching game, and I opted to use the "Family Game" rules with the "Power of Elections" optional scoring rule.  Not as good as the full game, but useful for teaching three new players.  This did fit in a single game night session comfortably.

All three games I have played have been won by the player who was Mayor.  In the first two games a single player was mayor all three decades.  This may bear some watching.  Hopefully better play will prove that the Mayor role is not a guarantee of victory.

Interesting CDG city builder that has you building the city of Pueblo in turbulent times. Simple components represent everything a budding city needs, from claimed plots and houses to mines, factories, and municipal buildings. Every card has multiple uses and can be played for MM (action points) or the headline event on the card. The events are historically accurate and offer a great peak into Pueblo's unique history.

Like all CDGs, this game rewards multiple plays and veterans will have a significant advantage over new players. It requires a bit of "playing down" to the experience level for it to be fun, as running away with a victory due to knowledge of card content isn't fun for anyone.

its an average game with some huge problems.
-the game is way to long and much more than 120m indicated on the box (approx 3.5 hours) .
-The cards are super unbalanced. Some cards will give you over 10mm worth of stuff and anothers 4mm. 
-there is a problem in the core of the game. Building lots is pointless. A max a lot will ever score is 1 point and a house is min 1 point and add to votes. Why waste mm building lots ?
-There are not enough cards in the deck that increase the tracks to build a strategy around them.
-last era cards are better so why have it setup so that someone can be delt all first era cards in the last round ?

Interesting idea with cool mechanics (I love card-driven games), but boy is there a lot wrong with this game. In the first place it's in no way pretty. Secondly, it has way way WAY too much take that. That just removes all fun from the game and turns it into one big bash the leader event - the last thing you'd exoect from a city builder. Finally, however, the final nail in the coffin: this game was not play-tested at all (or very very poorly). Playing a card for points just didn't happen because the actions were so ridiculously good. Then what's the point of the points? One card I had exemplified this perfectly. It gave 4MM (action points), or as the action it gave you something like "place three houses, four blocks, and then use 4MM". Who in their right mind would play such a card for the points?!?

Maybe not completely polished, but the rulebook seems solid enough to get a game going - and what a strong game it is!  The one thing it could really use is massively streamlined scoring.  Scoring is about the most difficult I've come across, as multipliers apply or don't apply at different times to the same objects depending on what part of scoring they're being used to calculate.  Houses are counted 2 or 3 times, leading to second-guessing and re-counts at each of the 3 scoring phases.  Whew!  Get this re-worked and the game would be an easy 9.

Other than scoring, the game progresses smoothly, tripping over one another to maintain dominance, and even the stealing and destruction feels in-keeping with the theme.

First three player game resulted in mass confusion. That game I rate a 5.  So many cards, so many building and placing questions that are not properly answered in the rulebook, as well as very fiddly scoring rules. This game seriously needs an updated rule book and faq.  I think there are too many cards and the way they are mixed doesn't make sense. Why are 1890 cards showing up in the 1910 deck? Why not just keep the three era decks separate? There are plenty of cards in the first two eras. I could see much replay value with those two decks so there doesn't seem to be any reason to have to mix them all together. In third era,  I ended up not even having any cards from that era, just the earlier ones. This doesn't make any thematic sense at all. 

Game time is much longer than advertised:  at least three hours for three players and that is after a half hour rules explanation followed by continuous rules lookups. This is the main reason I give it a 6. (Two player count)  Won’t get played very often. 3 hour plus games are not a good idea, for any player count. 

The role that lets you pick three additional cards at the beginning of an era and distribute one to each player seems superfluous. You already spend much time going through your initial 7 cards picking some and banking the others. That role just adds more downtime for card set up. Tempted to drop that role. 

One player found himself in third place on the influence track throughout the whole game with seemingly no way to get out of it.  I tried to tell him that he could get out of it by winning the election but he continuously exclaimed,  "This is bullshit."  I could understand his point as it just seemed like random chaos as to who was where on the track. He also wasn't happy to lose Election ties from being in last place in influence. 

Many accusations of the mining official being overpowered and it certainly is if other players continually let you keep it.  I was embarrassed from the points I made on that role.  I have read reported problems with the mayor role being overpowered but we used the variant where the mayor does not score the points until the elections happen end of an era, so there were no complaints about that role.  I highly recommend that variant be used all the time. 

 It is really hard to try and forecast how well you are doing in a particular neighborhood because of the huge variance of buildings and how they score in relation to each other. You need at least a full game to even understand how to score well and influence elections.  There is confusion between what commercial buildings do and what civic buildings do because they look exactly like mansions and the mansions have their own scoring thing with your own buildings. It is also very easy to mess up park placement and place them over streets. Also confusion about where one neighbourhood ended and another began. When counting points, players often mixed two adjoining areas together, forcing us to restart counts many times. 

 There is a lot of random chaos and leader bashing in this game with occasional wow moments when you chain a nice card combo.  I had a combo that let me score off the revolt track and I kept hoping nobody was going to push the track into a riot before I could get my points.  There are also many humorous moments when you do things like destroy someone's mansion and build an insane asylum in its place,  causing the vacated tenants of the mansion to  increase the revolt track. I love the thematic connection of the cards to the mechanics.  It's also a great history lesson of the city. 

 I love the city builder aspect of this game but I think the box art is totally misleading and is hurting sales. I initially would never have purchased this game based on the box art and the title as it leads you to believe it's all about forging steel in a mine. Boring! Mining is a very small part of this game. Building the city is the main part of this game and I don't know why they didn't show this on the box art. It would appeal to a much wider audience. 

This is a game that definitely will need multiple plays to wrap your head around it, but based on my first play with three players I don't think I will get them to ever play this game again which is really unfortunate. I don't think I have ever spent so much time reading and rereading a rulebook as this one. Main problem lies in the fact that there are separate rules for building things with mm points and building things with event cards. This really needs to be explained better in the rulebook. The player aid also has rules mistakes on it.  I understand that this is a kick starter and that things can go out the door half baked,  but this certainly does not increase my confidence in purchasing kick starters in the future. The designers need to post a proper play through video (their current video is based on an early version of the game that is no longer accurate for rules or even the board layout! Update: they removed it) as well as a clearer rulebook pdf and/or faq.

Update after second play): after getting important questions cleared up by the helpful designers, my next two player game went much more smoothly, even though I still screwed up the mining official rule for taking bonus points when scoring. (I had 9 mines, took nine bonus when the max was 4) This makes mining official not as overpowered as I thought. I lost this game in spite of having mining official all three rounds. Best part: my wife won her first game and really enjoyed it, even though I would not categorize her as a heavy gamer.

This is a cool game but rather mean.  It quickly becomes very much a screw the other opponent game and the cards are VERY powerful.  It can be quite swingy late in the game.

Forged in Steel is a multiplayer city-building game that uses the card-driven system that's found in a number of wargames.  Cards can either be executed for their event or used for a specified number of action points; cards that are used for action points are shuffled back into the deck for future rounds.  Points can be used to zone areas on the map board, which give you points if another player builds a building there.  They can also be used for houses, commercial buildings, factories, and mines.  These are placed in differently-sized districts, and contribute to an area-majority vote for the mayor role, which can be a good source of points.  The game does feature a lot of take-that, but it somehow doesn't feel out of place in this sort of game.  At the end of the game, buildings score based on how much certain tracks have moved during the game.  I thought this was an interesting application of a wargame mechanic to a game with more euro sensibilities.  All of the different cards really contributed to the historical sense of the game, as well as the variety in gameplay.  I enjoyed this.

This is a really exciting city building game that feels like a cross between the card play of [thing=12333][/thing] and the tactical logistics of [thing=62220][/thing]. Essentially, each player gets a hand of cards. They set some of those aside for future rounds, keep some and discard 1. Then they draft 1 more card. Each player also gets to chose 1 or more jobs, which gives them special powers for the round. Then, players simultaneously select a card to play, and reveal from lowest number of printed action points to highest number. 

The city is represented by this interesting grid and the structures are these cool wooden buildings. The game also allows you to punch the leader by stealing or removing buildings, but doing so can result in risk for you, as if players are too aggressive with their actions too often, it sets off a disaster event that targets the player who was the most aggressive. That being said, there is no shortage of take-that actions in this game. 

This game definitely subscribes to the game design philosophy of dialing up the power of cards to 10, and letting the fact that everything is insane be the balancing factor, which I think is a wild ride but I can see how it might be a tough curve. It's possible for a player to luck into some insane combos, and then it's up to other players to use the board to punch them enough to balance things out. Whether this is a strength or weakness of the game is taster's choice.

Confusion over final rules. Do cards supersede rulebook? One possible collection of cards can result in broken game. Are there more? Not really interested in finding out.

I didn't feel I was playing an euro, but rather and overly extended version of "We Didn’t Playtest This At All".So much randomness makes this impossible to develop a strategy. I don't know how many times someone said "oh no my card is worthless now that you've played yours, that no one could predict or see coming". Had no fun.

Wade has spent some solid time updating the mechanics on this one. Things are really starting to shape up. He has streamlined quite a few areas of the game, as well as adding some wonderful additions. The cards have been adjusted to play off each other more so and powerful chains can really reward players.

Obviously a labor of love by a designer that knows his history. Game can be as nice or as nasty as the players style. Clocks in at 3 hours for a 4-player game, a bit longer with newer players. This is a war game disguised as a Euro city-builder. Rule 1: bash the leader. Rule 2: maximize your own points. Rule 3: see Rule 1. After repeated plays, upped rating to a 9.

Truly a fun game.  Nice amount of player interaction.  Initially a bit complex to learn, but certainly lots of decisions to be had.  As a playtester of this yet-to-be published game, amazed at the balance in the cards.

UPDATE: I understand that as part of the development team, I'm a bit biased, but given that this is years in the making and coming from a set of people that are very experienced gamers, this game is a gem coming from a small publisher. It is so nicely polished, something you don't see nearly often enough from Kickstarter games. Choosing your cards simultaneously reduces AP and keeps players engaged, and the game oozes with the theme of building Pueblo in the late 1800s/early 1900s. It's highly interactive and the choices are very diverse as each card can be played in one of two ways. I'm really excited to get an actual copy of my hands next year.

UPDATE #2: Now published, and really with quality components. This is a unique card-driven game and is something that is fun and dynamic.

[url=https://www.boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/61311/item/1479571#item1479571]1 play[/url], back when it was Adobe, Stone, and Steel

I [i]really[/i] enjoy [thing=12333][/thing], although I don't get to play it nearly as much as I'd prefer (when's someone going to make a PBW version?!). I've played part of a game of [thing=234][/thing], and enjoyed that as well (but probably not enough to keep in the long run). But I haven't been as much of a fan of the other CDG's I've tried: [thing=27708][/thing] and [thing=37358][/thing]. The former seems a bit too much back-and-forth-undo-what-the-other-guy-did, the latter a bit too chaotic; and neither has as interesting a theme, nor the level of tension, as in TS. Still, I've been wanting to try ASST for some time (failed to get together with the prototype alley play last year!) because of its CDG roots.

The game play is pretty straightforward, although I didn't really get it until near the end of the game (if that -- I came in dead last, by a wide margin!). It has some interesting things going on, for example: role selection (appointment, really; Mayor doles them out to other players; I think for Turn 1, these ought to be fixed by player order rather than allocated by a randomly determined Mayor), card-banking (like 1960; set aside cards each round to create your hand for the final round), area majorities, etc. I'd like to play it again to get a better feel for it, but I think I'll likely still end up preferring the 2-player game(s)!

Game components are good although the graphics are not very helpful. The basic concept of the game is interesting and the theme is present at some extent, especially what is driven by the cards. My main complaint is related to the apparent lack of strategies. Each building seems to work in the exact same way in terms of strategy. The amount of VP's is more related to what is built around the buildings and not the actual buildings. I would rather want different buildings for really different strategies.

These rules are a challenge, not only for unusual mechanics but also because there's  some lack of attention-to-detail in organization. It's very important to read the italicized "Important" notes as they clear up a multitude of questions.

The individual mechanics are quite interesting, and they mesh together surprisingly well. Thankfully things were streamlined during development so the game flows really well.

I mostly liked it, but the game wasn't received well at all in my regular group (sigh), so shelved.

Innovative mix of genres, CDG mechanics in a city-building euro. While I enjoy the card play, I'm not sure that the board part holds its weight. I wish more of scoring were based on area majority. 

While the design feels a little loose overall, the game has charm in spades. Clearly a labor of love by someone passionate about local history.

This is an engaging CDG with a moderately ugly board and little to disquise the spreadsheet lurking beneath the surface. It's delightfully interactive (read: mean) and the events really capture the essence of the theme that is only hinted at with the other components. The card banking mechanics and role selections are well implemented. Good game!

Twilight Struggle aspect of mechanics via card play (for effect or for points). Mostly card comboing and advanced planning by setting cards aside for use in future ages as well as paying attention to which building players are driving up the value of. You can also get really screwed by card effects played by opponents, which are not really mitigatable, especially toward the end of the game. The mechanics don't interest me enough to play this again, in fact, they really made me want to trade Twilight Struggle.

Unfortunately, not as good as I was hoping.  Cards were very swingy, and building didn't pace well through game.  Plus, scoring was painful.

Feels like Kickstarter fare - get rid of 1/3 of the game and it would probably be better.

There are some very basic tenants in game design: Make the rules clear and easy to understand, make players feel like they have a chance to win until the very end, and don't allow for card combinations, that "break" the game. (Did I mention that another tenant is that a good game should make you want to play again at the end?)

This game does not obey those tenants. Possibly it would be better if the rules were clear, and possible it would be better if the cards were clear, but since neither are easy to understand, I think that this is a very, very poorly designed game. Went in with very high expectations (some people like it better than Terraforming Mars). We cut the game short after 5 hours, and countless minutes spent trying to understand the instructions. 

It honestly reminds me of a game that wasn't blind play tested.

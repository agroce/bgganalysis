Fun building the castle with its physical components. Very easy to end up having to top deck though, which isn't fun. (So it seems that being patient: ie not playing all your cards too early, is key)

The game feels a lot older than it is. You are setting up plastic walls and towers according to patterns on cards, and then attempting to claim them with your colored pieces for various point levels. Pretty strategic stuff for what it is, but there's not a whole lot to it. A decent alternative if you were to get bored of something like Torres.

UPDATE: We've got the red/blue edition, will pick up a green/yellow set for 3-4 player capability when we see one on the cheap.

This is basically the children's game where you draw lines to make boxes. The person who's line created the last wall of the box adds their initials to the box. Most initals win... but now you get to pay Steve Jackson to play it!

RATING: 3
Oh these horrible abstracts, they make playing such a pain!

So is Castellan as well: despite looking so good on the table, it’s just a dry and lackluster game that rewards the player who thinks longer and plans many turns in advance.

There’s no joy at all in Castellan for those who play with their guts.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
It's a decent 2 player game, but there are better choices out there. The rules are simple, and there is a good amount of strategy in the game. However, turns take too long if people are optimizing their scores, and it is easy to have a series of turns where you can't do anything because of bad luck.

It's like that old pencil and paper game where you have a grid of dots and you are trying to complete squares without allowing your opponent to complete more squares than you.  Fun and quick game, even though I have yet to win, I like playing this game because it also looks cool by the end.  Eager to try it with 4 players now that I got the alternate color set.

A friend of mine described this game perfectly... It's basically the connect the dots game we all played as a kid but with a fancier execution and some added concepts. This isn't a bad thing, but its also not a game I'd regularly take to game night.

Super light game, easy enough for even a six year-old to learn. I don't know if it's the most stimulating game I've ever played, but I had fun. Choosing how many cards to play can be tricky, and often you don't know which walls to build and where until you've already played your card. Entertaining enough.

One of the few abstracts that I enjoy playing.  Must be the "castle" theme (if there can be a theme in an abstract), but it plays quick, and has nice replayability due to the randomness of the card draws.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Castellan is an abstract game where you play cards, collect wall and turret pieces, and then assemble those pieces to enclose areas and score points. On your turn you can play as many cards as you want, so the game challenges you to pace how aggressive you want to play your hand.

Ugh. Maybe I was tired, but the game just didn't click with me. There's a few abstracts I like (Yinsh, Through the Desert, Taluva, etc.) but this one left me a bit bewildered. Either my hand was jammed with lousy cards or I just don't know how to play the game.

We have both sets so we can play a four player game. You each have a set of towers and walls to add to a castle depending on your cards. Your goal is to complete courtyards containing the most towers. Each player has the same set of cards and pieces so the management is what makes the difference. It plays well and is easy to teach.

This game reminds me a lot of the pen and paper game I used to play in middle school.  Where you create a dot grid and each person takes turns drawing a line between two dots and whoever closed a square got a point.

This is basically the same thing but in 3D form  The castle theme is a neat take, but I don't see this two player game making it to the table very often. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Quick and simple abstract game with pretty plastic pieces. Nothing very exciting, but it is a well designed and pleasant game where the players have to plan around their cards. These provide a necessary amount of randomness, but the cards that grant extra cards may be too important.

I must mention that I was almost put off by the horrendous package made for store display, but it only disguises the real box inside - actually very nice, just the right size for the components.

Fun little game with some neat decisions as far as managing resources (cards), deciding when to double up on keeps to max the points for them, then do you later split that max point courtyard to add another courtyard/keep. 

Try to leave a little something to possibly help you later but hopefully not by helping your opponent on their next turn. Seeing how many cards they have in their hand can help you decide what you can leave for them, because if they only have one wall card in their hand, then it may be hard for them to complete much as it might not have any towers or only 1. 

My kids enjoy it too.

In the four player game you have little control over what you will be building upon later.  I'm guessing that three players would be the sweet spot.  It also appears that getting ALL of your towers onto the board is a better strategy than maximizing fewer towers.

RATING: 6.25
The plastic pieces are fun and fit together quite well (almost too well, they aren't easy to take apart).  There is an element of brinksmanship that may remind you of Medina where you're each contributing to this building of something and then one of you claims it.  A nice 2 player game but it can accommodate 4 if you buy two copies.

In Castellan, two players work together to build a castle. Finely-detailed wall and tower pieces link together to form courtyards, and the player who finishes a courtyard claims it with a Keep, scoring points for that courtyard equal to the number of tower pieces surrounding it.

A puzzle style game where score points by building and completing courtyards. The number of points is based on the number of towers in the yard. The walls and towers to use in construction is determined by the cards you hold adn draw so there is a hand management element as you build to make a big move. Both can use existing walls and towers so part of the game is not to leave too much for your opponent to use.

Nice looking components - good look and feel to the game.

This game is just not good. Having to play cards to select pieces to then claim sections is just meh. Owned this for a few months and never played beyond the first time I got it, and never wanted to. Will be just fine if I never get to play again. No brilliant mechanics. The interlocking pieces are cool, but the gameplay around them is simply boring to me.

Should appeal to those who enjoy games where you build a shared playfield together, such as Carcassonne.  I really like the interlocking components.  In my opinion, it could use a few different pieces (gates or higher towers, for example) to spice things up a bit, but it's perfectly fine and fun as is.

Jogo com uma produção magnífica, pois os componentes estão muito detalhados e funcionais, além da belíssima apresentação da embalagem, que contem outra caixa para armazenamento posterior. Quanto à jogabilidade, é engraçado e bastante simples, bem ao estilo dos jogos dos tempos de escola, nos quais batava um caderno e um lápis para começar a jogar...

Very luck based when drawing cards. There is no way to mitigate a poor start if your opponent has an optimal draw the first two turns. This game would get boring for me very quickly.

RATING: 7
Interesting game with simple elegant rules and some nice strategic/tactical discoveries to make. Short enough that we want to play "just one more".

The bits lock together in a way we found occasionally annoyingly fiddly (both locking together during play and then unlocking the completed castle structure into individual pieces at the end to clean up). And the plastic feels a little "cheap" and light. But we still enjoyed it. Main complaint is the luck of the draw, but I guess the game is targeted at a filler / lighter / family type audience instead of more hard-core abstract fans. I imagine it will indeed have good "toy value" for fans of Lego and stuff like that.

Has some molded plastic walls and towers that are cool but can be difficult to fit into each other. The game is fun, and I like how it changes the classic dot and boxes up by giving you each the same deck of cards with different numbers and types of pieces you can use that turn. My girlfriend didn't enjoy it that much so in one of my cullings I decided to sell it.

RATING: 6.8
I own blue, red, want yellow, green.

I plan on some additional uses for the pieces; build a dice rolling area for dice games, build castle walls to add a limiting challenge for Castle of Mad King Ludwig, build some little corrals to separate chits or things getting out of hand, depending on the game and table space . . .make a gem or coin bank for games that have gems or coins. I have a gem bits games geeklist, someone has one for games with coins. Use when playing button men, to define rolling area-battlefield . . . Use with Dungeon Roll . .Some other idesas YMMV

I wish there was more to this game. It doesn't quite do for me what Carcassonne does, but is designed to fill the same niche. Therefore, given the option, I'm typically going to choose Carcassonne. However, still a decent game (though a bit of a pain to put away if you mix sets for a 4 player game).

A nice, lightweight area control game, effectively. What makes this really cool are the pieces, as it looks like you're really building a castle. You have a little bit of strategy in how you manage your hand, as you can choose not to build all your cards and you also have the opportunity to double one courtyard. All in all, a fun game.

The mechanic is sound, if somewhat simple - enclose spaces with walls and towers and claim points based on how many towers are part of the enclosure. Unfortunately, shoddy manufacturing means the pieces don't fit together well, which just ruins the play experience.

Very fun game of capitalizing on opportunities.  This game is very interesting in that you don't really want to leave any opportunities for your opponent but you'll basically have to.  You have to manage what you leave as much as what you do on your turn.

Ingenious box, great components, the game is nice. What's wrong with that one? Somehow, it isn't a frequent guest on our table.

RATING: 5
I'm unsure what to make of this. It seems to be that the ideal thing to do is hang back until your opponent runs out of cards so that you can play a bunch all in one go. The few cards that allow you to draw cards also seem pretty powerful and drawing one on the last turn seemed to put me at a great disadvantage.

That said, I quite enjoyed playing it and am keen to try it again.

Update: This is a bit samey each play and after 2 plays I feel that I might have seen everything in the game.

Rating down from 7 to 5.

It's like that game where you had to try and add lines to a grid of dots in the hope of making more boxes than your friend does. Except with math.

A grown-up version of Legos, where you get to build castles with plastic pieces.  It has some interesting aspects of card management because you can play as many cards as you want, but only draw one per turn.  So if you spend 4 cards and get a huge castle, now your options will be limited for the rest of the game.  In our game, both of my opponents ran our of cards in a hurry and I just slow played, then I had like 5 cards left that I could play out however I wanted.  So that was kind of weird.  But, it was still marginally entertaining.

RATING: 8
Very light filler game but no worse for it. Seems pretty well balanced though has that strange feel of a game waiting for a few 'variant' rules to come along. An early mistake can make a lot of difference and 2 well matched players can end up horse trading moves waiting for one or other to get a better/worse card draft. Overall a great little filler game, easy to teach, good for kids and parents and 'chatty' gaming.

Played a demo of this game at UK Games Expo 2013.
This is a great game, love the theme and components and would like to get a copy once it is released.
Only worry is that it could be too expensive in the UK for what most would see as a filler game.

Great game!  I recommend it for children as it is extremely easy to play, has fun little pieces, and is a quick 20-30 minuet game.  I as an adult appreciate fun games over strategic and this game was a delightful mix of both.

The game is good for what it is.  It's not Twilight Imperium, or Go, it's a simple game for 2 players who want a casual, tactile gaming experience.  I purchased this game as one of my first board games, and it has not made it to the table nearly as much as I would like.  I would recommend this game if you have kids, and the components can easily be used for their toy value for building walls around castles.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This is sort of like the old traditional squares (dots and boxes) game, but in this case it is played with different sized 3 dimensional walls to allow for different sized squares. it also differs in that it isn't played on a grid, but rather on an open table with player deployed towers acting as the "dots" of the grid.

Play is card driven, with the cards depicting how many and what types of pieces a player may deploy on their turn. Enclose an area and score one point for every tower that borders the enclosed area. There are a couple of additional minor mechanics to spice things up, but for the most part that is all there is to it.

It's a pretty average abstract with great bits, but it does have a big upside in that it plays amazingly well with kids. Older kids can play the rules as written, but with younger ones you can easily just deal cards right off the top of the deck and let them build and score what the cards give them. The game still works that way and even maintains some meaningful decisions, which makes it a great learning tool.

At the very least, you can gut it for terrain for your tabletop miniatures game, assuming you have a use for knee high walls. :D

A fantastic 2 player game, or 4 player when combined with the green/yellow International version. Plays in an hour or less. It's a very light game with lots of strategy and visual appeal. The fit and finish is quite nice with the all plastic pieces and the cards are nicer than the standard S.J. Games fare.

This is one I bring out to non-gamers or people just looking for something light that has a bit more to it than say just a dice game, for example.

RATING: 6
Fun for what it is.  Bought with the intention of playing 4-player, with 2 copies, but it became very obvious that 4 players would take prohibitively long.  As it is, 2-player works fine but, even then, you can't really plan much, until the other guy takes his turn, so it still "feels" like there's an excessive amount of downtime.

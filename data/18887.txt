I love this game.  It has just enough detail, without going overboard (*pointing a finger at ASL*).  The maps in both Streets of Stalingrad and Dzerhezinsky Tractor Works are gorgeous.  I really like the over-sized map in Streets.

Cool introductory game with a nice map and four scenarios that play pretty good with full rules too. Even if there are not so many scenarios, compared to standard ATS releases, these are among the most played by ATSers. This means something.

RATING: N/A
Not one of the better WWII tactical games out there: more of an ASL copycat that copied it incorrectly. ASL, Up Front, Lock 'n' Load, the TCS series, Tide of Iron, and my own Combat Commander all offer much more in their own unique ways. If any of these other titles were within reach, I'd pick them to play over ATS every time.

I gave the ATS system a go (given this offering's relatively cheap price), but won't be rushing out to buy any of the other titles.

This is a GREAT place to start with this system.  You get a much smaller rulebook, somewhat like ASL Starter Kit is to ASL.  ATS is a very fun system--more complex than LnL and less complex than ASL.  It hits just the right spot for me as a tactical game.  Start here and then go to Advanced Tobruk or Scottish Corridor.

Okay game. Having played the original Tobruk, I don't get the "Advanced" part in the series title.  If anything, AFV combat seems dumbed down in ATS.

The stripped-down rule book of Basic Game II is just that--stripped down, missing important rules, and IMHO unnecessary.  Just download the real rulebook and go for it.

A step up from basic game 1a, this can end up with tanks against tanks. The map has oversized hexes, too, to deal with stacks and stacks of counters.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.25
The large hexes certainly do facilitate playing with large number of counters.

Not really keen on the simplified rules for either of the basic games.  I understand the desire to simplify to introduce the system but it sure leads to confusion when you're converting to the full set.

Good firefight scenarios in this package.  Much better than Basic Game 1, but it is Stalingrad.

RATING: 10
Tentative rating based upon the components only. 

I LOVE the map, with BIG hexes and a hell of a scenario! 

Very interested in trying it out. 

UPDATE

It plays very FAST. I believe this has - as soon as I can wrap most of the relevant rules in my head - the potential to become my favourite tactical game!

UPDATE
Played it some more. Still good vibes. I believe that maybe smoke's a tad overpowered, a good thing could be to determine its obscuring malus with 2d3s instead of a clean -4. I may play test this and see how it is.

UPDATE
Great game. Dice may be swingy but the results are believable. This is becoming my first choice as for tactical games. 

UPDATE
This comment and vote is for the full game, with all the rules. 

Very close and personal, I feel this is the game I was looking so long to get. Very intense game and a bag full of fun. 

Yet some things irk me, namely some of the morale rules which model a certain type of behaviour which I still have to see if I can sit well with. I'll need to read the designer's notes to this game somewhere in the future. 

As for now I was thinking of adding the Hesitation rule you find in Retro, but it may be a tad too harsh on infantry as a whole, yet it could counteract the eagle's view you have of the battlefield. 

We'll need to test it and see how it goes. 


UPDATE
I came to love this system through this game, even if I played with the real thing. 

I'm still in the process of learning all the ropes. Some things irk me, such as morale (which favours concentration of forces, but I'm thinking it may balance out with artillery). 

But truly where this system shines is: attrition, close-combat, and armour. Much better than anything I've ever seen out there.

RATING: 7
Old time grog, this is my first ATS game.  First impressions are of a detailed game system to compete with AH's old Squad Leader.  I would go so far as to call this the new Squad Leader (not to be confused with Advanced Squad Leader).

However, this particular game seems incomplete.  I realize this game is supposed to be an introduction to the ATS system.  It feels to me (i.e. the detail seeking gamer buying this ATS monster system) that the game has holes in it.  You can "feel" where there are rules missing sometimes.  For example: What happens when a broken unit routs?  In the full, real ATS game system these units surrender but in this game there is no effect (there are even surrender counters included).

The ATS system is a hard-core grognard wargame in the old Squad Leader tradition.  But, I am not sure it is really a major improvement over the original and I had hoped that after several decades game designers could come up with a better way to organize a large and complex game system...  

On the plus side this game is pretty cheap, the full rules can be had at a reasonable price, the game is very well supported and BIG hexes are very nice!

Jan-2011 downgraded as I just don't see the advantage of this system over the old SL or ASL game systems.  If your locals play this, go for it, if they play Squad Leader games, get that.  :-|

When you liked BGIa and want to do some heavy streetfighting this is the one for you, or you can pick this one up right away if you like to see the Stalingrad battle up close and personal.
With its large size hexes, which give you enough room for the informational markers, this is a good starters game.

1st try at an ATS game, I liked it quite a bit.  Map is very detailed and the large hexes are a plus. Counters are great, 1/2" reserved for most markers, infantry, leaders and support weapons are 5/8".  Bloody combat system--squads can and often do take up to 4 step losses (full strength, casualty marker, flipped counter, casualty, then eliminated) with a corresponding loss of firepower and morale.  In the close-quarters urban map, there's ample opportunity for melee, adding to the bloodshed.

My previous tac sim experience is in the old days with Squad Leader (no ASL experience here) and found this fairly comparable in terms of playability. An MG in a good position is even deadlier than SL as instead of penetration, MG's have can fire 2-3 times a turn. Basic rules w/this game don't have elevation rules so LOS issues are simplified but a little less detailed than the full ATS ruleset.

Interest OOB difference from the urban East Front SL scenarios though--in this one, the Russians also have plenty of manpower, but they're not quite so leader deficient, making those human wave assaults even deadlier since there are more leaders to direct firegroups and rally broken squads.

Do not like ATS, rules are complicated and non-intuitive. They just seems sometimes odd. We did not like our session.
Artwork is not top-notch as well.

RATING: 7
This is supposed to be an introduction to ATS.  Instead of clarifying the rules, they just deleted the ones that don't apply to the game, leaving a 20 page rules set that feels like it has holes in it if you've ever played by the full ATS rules.  I think it would be hard for someone new to the system to pick it up and learn it.  They'd be better off getting one of the boxed ATS games and starting with the 3 page basic rules that come in those.  

The four scenarios in this game are interesting and play well with the full ATS rules set.

ATS comes to the most brutal urban battlefields in military history, and does so with some good scenarios and a very good map. Speaking of the map, I really appreciated the larger hexes.

RATING: 7
Nice game, not so nice artwork. Wish the map had a bit more contrast but I like the big hexes. The 3/4" counters for the AFVs and the 5/8" for weapons and personnel are easy to read and move. The hand photocopied instructions (vs. web or sheet printed) always bothers me.

RATING: 9
Really looking forward to this ATS game system being applied to the bitter struggle in the city of Stalingrad.  My gut feeling is that the ATS basic game system is particularly suitable for this infantry dominant battles fighting street by street. 

4 scenarios come with 4 sheet of counters (1 being the large 3/4" vehicle counters.  Total 460 counters).  1 stanard 34"*22" map with extra large hex.  It is really cool to have this as the no. of counters pile up.  New terrains are introduced with a lot of building structures (railroad, sewers, storage tanks, factory etc.) AFVs are also new to basic gamer. 2 AFV cards with Gun Penetration Value tables.  I love this game particularly because all major tanks on both sides started to pour into the battlefiled.  Panzer III and IV for the German and T34, KV I for the Russian. 3 out of the 4 scenarios included contain tanks on either both sides. Panzer IV and T34 are the common units seen in Stalingrad. Panzer IV is 60% more effective than T34 at short range and 70% more effective at medium range. Besides, their counters are stunning!!    

The rulebook is 20 pages, not a lot but fair amount to read for a new beginner.  The terrain rules are 2 pages only as opposed to the full length rulebook of 10.  The much wanted terrain chart is here (there is none in Basic Game 1a) wit 17 terrain types.  Entry cost for personnel and AFV is separately listed.     

The scenarios start with the infamous St. Yakov Pavlov's House (featured in an ASL scenario I played before).  The building was held for 49 days until the Russian counterattack relieved it.  The second scenario is the German Lt. Stempel struggle of the control of Bread Factory Nr. 2 (also covered in another ASL scenario "Baking Bread" I played).  The third scenario sees the bbone-tired German 21st and 26th Panzergrenadier regiments left to defend the Steel Factory against a reinforced Russian tanks 9 German vs. 12 Russian tanks.  This is the most complicated scenario of the 4.  The last scenario is the last standing few German infantrymen at the Krasny Oketyabr Plant (October Plant) face off the Russian counterattack in Nov 1942 in chilling and freezing to death weather condition.       

ATS is superior to Combat Commander with its alternate impulse system beginning fire and movement each time with an initiative rolls.  This alone has already made the system a natural excitment rather than adding a lot of "uncertainty" in a twisted fashion. A lot of dice rolling and DRMs add the flavour it needs at tactical level and the battle is so real in front of your eyes. I always play this one more than CC and ASLSK.  It might be on par with Lock n' Load, but more doze of a reality and less gamey.    

My copy come without the red sheet cover (that is a second edition cover).  Cost $24.  An error on the casualties in the last page example of mortar combat is noted.  For a "C2" result, the infantry personnel unit should be flipped, not marked with a "casualties" only because a casualty marker is only one step loss, not the two called by the result.  Air rules, on the other hand, are not present in the Basic Game 2 but are available in the second edition (larger hex, fuller system).  

ATS...a rising star in replacement of ASL system.  This is a monumental and historical module for ATS. I wish I could have cruised in the world of Advanced Tobruk System since my days of Advanced Tobruk System Basic Game 1a: Screaming Eagles in France at Carentan. Finding an opponent is a problem as people are either daunted by the sheer amount of details in tactical games or stuck at Advanced Squad Leader. To me, however, Advanced Tobruk System is the King of tactical level wargames. 

I schedule up with Jerome for a game of ATS Basic Game II: Streets of Stalingrad, inroad further with tanks in Russia, Stalingrad. As I re-read the rules, a sense of excitement comes up again - familiar like old friends meeting. The rules are very well written and explain everything in a logical manner. It's easy to find where they are if you have a problem with a rule. Air rules, however, are not present in this Basic Game.  

ATS is a very interactive impulsed-based system with constant actions, melding movement, combat, terrain and history together seamlessly. The horror of firegroup, tank firepower, intensity of infantry melee, etc. all that you are expected to experience in full in one package. Now, move on to the struggle of the city of Stalingrad, fighting from street to street, house to house!
-------------------------------------
I asked Jerome to pick up one scenario from the four. He picked scenario 2 "Vorwart" (8 turns) and became Russian while I played the Germans. Here is a synopsis of the scenario:

The German 14th Panzer Division attempts to capture Bread Factory Nr. 2 in Red Barricade. Sergent Esser shouted the word to motivate his men in the ruins to move out. He was killed and replaced by Lieutenant Stempel, who pushed his men relentless towards the edge of Volga river. The call was temporarily halted by the Soviet 768th Rifle Regiment, dug-in, and declared the area to be one of "Fanatic Resistance Nest". Anyone who wanted to retreat, Volga river was just 200 meters behind the back, would have to bite the bullet fired by Commissar Ljudnikov first.

Situational analysis:
The Russian deployed first and the German second. The German would have 5 consecutive impulses in the beginning - mimic wave of German soldier attacks after the "Vorwart!" call by Lieutenant Stempel. Jerome deployed the Russians into two lines inside factories - one located forward behind the wall on the west side of the compound, and one further behind, approximate 250 yards of open ground, the first. On the north, there was a large building and next to it, several storage tanks. Commissar Ljudnikov ordered the only Russian antitank PTP32 to stay at the second line of defense for establishing clear line of sight over the railroad tracks at its arc of fire, shooting any German tanks breaking through along the road on the south. Commissar Ljudnikov himself led the men in the first line as he was a leader who didn't have to check morale when his men were about to break. He was determined not to have any one stepping back.

Stemple deployed the tanks along the road on the south, looking for a swift tank breakthrough to the second line directly. He ordered his men to fire suppressively on the Russians and soon their left flank was broken. At the same time, some brave squads of the 768th Rifle Regiment made counterattacks into German's left flank in the main building, lightly defended by one crew and a leader, capturing the M/MG42 from the Germans.

With the risk of being outflanked, Stemple ordered a charge over the wall into the first Russian defense line in the factories. Melee ensued and heavy blood was shed. Ljudnikov was wounded. The charge was successful and the first line was cleared of Russians after heavy casualties on both sides. Bloody-hell! The melee rules have no retreat but fighting to the last man standing.

After securing the junkyard to the right side of the factory, PzIIIh moved into the open ground of railroad and shellholes, receiving a shot from the PTP32 AT at the front hull. The Russians were surprised to see the gun shot did not hurt the tank at all as it could not even penetrate the armor of tank in the first place. PzIVf2 made a echoleon move toward the second line of defense. At this point, Jerome had to go and we stopped the game at turn 4, halfway through the scenario.

What I like best about the system? It is extremely fun and atmospheric! The ATS sequence of play is hyper interactive (impulse-based activations), highly fluid gameplay (you can pass, move some or all of your units), mashing and meshing assault movements and fires among all the combat units (firing half of your Gun Fire factor while moving the units), hell-like no-mercy melee rules (melee until units from one side are completely eliminated), extended range of fire at half strength, the cover state of the terrains (the higher the cover state, the more column shifts in favor of the defenders in the Casualty Table), movement based opportunity fire (hey you, don't ever dare to come closer to me), line-of-sight depending on blocking (you can't fire at what you can't see) or obstructing terrains (shifts in Hit Probability Table to less chance to make a hit) etc. All of that are rendered organically, simulating the tactical level behavior of the soldiers super realistically!

The system is truly excellent, even though I have only limited experience with it so far, mostly with the Basic Game 1a Screaming Eagles. The system just turned me on with tactical level WW2 wargames. It is better than both Advanced Squad Leader and Lock n' Load in my book, although they both have their own design uniqueness in dealing with battles at such a scale. However, one thing I am very sure about is that I would definitely want to spend more time diving more into the ATS system than the other two, fantasizing with the pictures of tanks or AFVs, faces of soldiers, images of burning buildings while reading the rules of ATS. In a word, ATS is more realistic than Lock n' Load while more streamlined than ASL. I love the system and the series games. Next, I should play them more at home!

The second of the "starter kits" is a massive step-up from BG1a...It has the largest hexes you've ever seen on a fantastic map, and the rules fill in a lot of gaps (and just plain old holes) that the first one left for the sake of brevity.  In short, this game hits both marks:  It both entices me to play the full ATS rules, and it is a satisfying game experience on its own.

My introduction to ATS.  

Good, short and sharp scenarios. ATS Rules subset covers the core ATS concepts (armor, guns, infantry, support weapons, but no offboard artillery) and is a good starting point for deciding if this is the game system for you (all in 20 pages)

Large hex map and the scenarios (4) still make this worth picking up even if you already have other ATS modules, but somewhat superseded by 2nd edition ATS Stalingrad.

The only game I have ever had where the tanks are too small for the terrain scale. Slight problem with where the tanks are in the hex to determine angle of attack. I assume bearings are taken from the central dot regardless of where the tank is actually laid in the large hex.

I love Combat Commander and respect Chadwick but feel uneasy about him adding his 'no rating' utterance to this list. It seems somehow ungentlemanly and suggestive of a conflict of interest. I suppose though that he is entitled to his viewpoint....?

RATING: 7.5
Good, detailed tactical game. Much more interactive than ASL and I dare say it accomplishes a similar simulation value with much shorter rules. It is table heavy in an old school kind of way, though, but the processes of using the tables quickly becomes second nature, I guess. This comment is for playing the Basic Game II with most of the full rules. The Basic Game itself is fair enough, though there are a few rule ambiguities, for which a look at he full rules might help. Or you just use common sense, that works as well.

Just not really for me. Rules aren't all that basic once you mix infantry and AFVs, and they're pared down from a larger set. Plenty of supplemental help is available, but I had some confusion about differing versions (e.g., I went to look up something about grenade attacks, but it turns out they aren't even part of BGII). Kind of counter fiddly, but that's not unusual for squad-based. Lots of morale-check die rolls. I thought I'd love the urban combat, but it is pretty restrictive for LOS and tank movement. Still, I can't say this is a bad system, just not for me.    

Components aren't bad and I like the map, but the B&W BGG cover picture doesn't do it any favors.

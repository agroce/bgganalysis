A creative re-invention of Tic-Tac-Toe.   Not complex, but it fixes all the issues and has a good amount of filler-level thinking and second-guessing.   Nice package and presentation also.   I was skeptical, but this is well done.

This is basically just tic-tac-toe with a twist, but it's a brilliant twist that completely reinvents the game. My friend and I played it a few times with the normal rules, then came up with some advanced rules that ramp up the strategy ten-fold. I've included those in the variants forum.

I backed this game on Kickstarter and after getting to play it at Gen Con, I'm even more excited to add this to my collection and share it with my friends.  If you were ever a fan of tic-tac-toe, it takes that game, improves it, flips it on its head, and then improves it again.

Accomplishes exactly what it sets out to do -- make a portable strategy game using the basics of Tic Tac Toe with a cool theme and art. I wonder about the replayability, and can see this ending in a lot of draws, but those are minor complaints considering the low price of the game, its accessibility, and its portability.

Pasable para echar un ratito, aunque hay muchos mucho mejores. No es más que las tres en raya con un toque de deducción (incertidumbre, azar en realidad) y poderes especiales. Pueden provocarse desagradables bucles en algunos momentos y la deducción en general no es más que cara o cruz.

As a hobby gamer, I would have written off anything based on tic-tac-toe. It's been solved, right? I'm very glad my friends convinced me to try this game, because the designer "un-solved" tic-tac-toe into a very clever, strategic/tactical blend of a portable filler game.

Someone had to do it: turn Tic tac toe into a thematic and more strategic two Player. Quite successful i would say, although the special powers feel all very samey. Nice components and neat artwork. Highly portable.

A very strategic game that initially seems very simple.

Its tic-tac-toe with a difference, and the special abilities you pick, and what your opponent picks has a huge influence on how you are going to play in the round.

Me and my eldest son love this game to bits, as we get the strategy element of the game, others who have played it think it is a bit random, it isnt...just think about what you are doing and look at what special abilities are in play for both players each and every turn, it makes a big difference

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Not really my cup of tea but it does take the game of tic tac toe and actually make it somewhat interesting. There is also a fair bit of trying to figure out what your opponent is going to do which can prevent that player from placing their piece. Special characters abilities also influence game play. Quick playing, easy to teach.

A very fun, fits in the pocket game of espionage.  Great for a few minutes play (usually 10 minutes or so).  Rather like tic-tac-toe but where you can kill the other players' pieces.  A unique and original little game!

This is an excellent "tic-tac-toe" version, with cards, and at very good price! Little tactical game, with easy rules, fun, and so small you can take it everywhere you want!

This is basically a (much) more interesting version of tic tac toe.
The victory conditions stay the same but before you can place your stone, the other player can secretely tty to guess, where you will place it. 
If he's right, you can't place it and the other player has their turn. 
The specialists make the game phantastic. You shuffle all of them and draw two and then you decide, with which to play this round. They have their very own special ability which is great.
Highly recommended as a nice filler or travelling game.

A really light but well-made riff on tic-tac-toe. Besides the grid game that we all know, this one adds the theme of infiltrating a facility (the nine-space grid). You can predict which spot the other player will send his agent, effectively blocking his play. Kinda neat.

Each player also has a specialist each round who can manipulate the board in a cool way (eliminating someone, pushing people, switching spots, etc).

The game is quick to learn and teach, and I enjoyed its simplicity.

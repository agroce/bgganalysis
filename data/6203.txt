Finally played two sessions with my friends Kevin and Mondo, using the v4.0 rules. We played Scenario 8, which is smallish, but has enough units to make things interesting. I like the system very much. Wish I had enough moolah for Case Blue and people to play with.

RATING: 7
Despite being out of print this OCS title is usually underpriced, due to being superceded by the colossally overpriced Case Blue.

I have previously thought of this as a solid introduction to OCS, but that has been superceded recently by Sicily II, Tunisia II and, in some respects, Reluctant Enemies.

Still - the scenarios, I think, are good. Operation Star especially - a Russian attack on Kharkov - is excellent. 

The campaign game is heavily scripted to produce historical patterns, thereby limiting exploration of alternatives (Can the Germans manage a quick withdrawal? Can the Russians sustain an encirclement of a much larger area?).

I love the OCS system and the decisions it gives, but still I found the scripting here far too much of a straitjacket for genuinely compelling play, especially given the time and effort required.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Probably about as big as the OCS system can manage (in terms of size, length and density) and still be playable, unless your group are absolutely dedicated to the monsters. Far more playable in scope than its sibling GBII and an interesting treatment, not just of Op Saturn, but the aftermath and the battles in Ukraine in the first half of 1943.

Feel the OCS series is one of the best to give a feel for operations depicted.  The OCS games are driven by supply chits to limit what you can do. So a bit of book keeping/tracking of these and knowing when you can launch a major effort.  But it sure gives you a sense of tension and fighting for your life when the battle gets going.   Playing the Germans was really hard with limited supply but with really strong panzer divisions to help plugged the gaps and counter attack the raging Russians.  Have a good time with all the OCS games.  Would recommend for those players with the area, several maps, and the time, over 100 hours.  We had a great time.

This is probably about the high water mark for me in terms of counter numbers. I've only played the Stalingrad relief small scenario out (works with 4th ed rules) but man it took an age to set up. Lots of counter stacks etc. We will see, the game will live or die on the 2 map scenarios for me, the Back hand Blow, Uranus and Little Saturn.

RATING: 10
I like OCS system. It has its flaws, but I think it is one of the the best hex'n'counter wargames can offer. It is just amazing. I like how the different phases and modes create interesting choises with minimum fuzz. Player has to actually take supply into equation and not keeping reserves is not an option.

The situation in EatG is ver interesting with Soviets carrying the burden of the until the end of the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Really, really a nice game!
It captures the feeling of the eastern front perfectly.
The two army are very different in style of play and this is implemented with no special rules.
I played a campaign and it was a wonderful experience!
You should see what happens to the german when they get hit by 8 Kathusha in a narrow front.
Or when the German releases the SS Panzer Divisions....Das Reich,  Totenkopf, Adolf Hitler, Wiking all togheter.......and cut the russian front line like a knive it the butter...

Definitely showing its age now in the wake of Case Blue.  Still an OK game that can be obtained cheaply.  There are some "forcing" rules that tie the Soviet's hands around the Stalingrad pocket in the early going, and the lack of multi-unit formation identifiers is a drag with so many counters on the map.  But it will still work just fine with the latest OCS rules for those inclined to try it.

RATING: 1
This rating is based on a very careful consideration of this system, my experience of one other Gamers game (Crusader) for a confirmation of that company's world view, and a pretty intense playing of the Backhand Blow scenario, or at least until my suspicions were confirmed, which wasn't long.

The player with the offensive capable army will simply rip the opponent's forces to pieces, and continue to do so turn on turn until they're all gone.  Enemy rear area sightseeing trips happen every day, not just weekends.  The whole system eschews the depiction of friction (e.g. inter alia meaningful ZoCs) that serves to slow down the tempo of combat.  The attrition rate is grotesque, astronomical, and replacement rates do not begin to ameliorate the effect of this.  I cannot see how one of these games could go 'the distance' and one side or the other having a counter left on the map.

I conclude that this game is not play tested beyond the first few turns, and is probably intended to be set up, fiddled around with and then packed away.  Lest some vendetta is suspected, I do feel the Gamers try to put out quality product, and I support them by buying it.  

Note: these impressions date from 1995; a lot of work has gone into this system in the intervening years, and those that are keen on the results are a loyal following.

I played Enemy at the Gates using V4.2 of the OCS rules and charts, the latest errata and the suggested supply re-calibration. That seemed to work well, although supply was still overly abundant in the Manstein's Backhand Blow scenario I tried.  Otherwise this older OCS game played well with interesting interactions of terrain (mostly rivers), air power (when weather permits), armor and artillery.  As expected from the historical battle, this scenario is more dynamic than most OCS games.  Given the situations being covered, this should be true for most of the scenarios and for the full campaign.  I like the region and period chosen for the campaign, all the way from the formation of the Stalingrad pocket, through relief attempts, the next Soviet offensive and the final German response.  The well chosen scenarios play out in a day or two on two maps or less.  The game is rather sensitive to weather, both for river crossings and air power.  In short, a lively OCS game that can be played either single-sitting or monster scale.

First edition.  A playable "monster".  I participated in the initial playtests of the OCS.  We ran trucks by the handful around the map of Berg's "Campaign for North Africa".  That was the only practical use we ever got out of that game.  Obviously, Dean made major revisions to the supply system before releasing "Guderian's Blitzkrieg", the first game in the series.  It's always fun to see your own name in the design credits for a project like this.  don't ask about the burritos - they were truly hideous.

RATING: N/A
In the process of reading the 4.2 rules. There seems to be a lack of elegance in (at least) 2 aspects: 1) (paraphrase) 'this ruling occurs in EVERY and ALL instances EXCEPT for a, b, c, etc.' and 2) taking into account many details to avoid the 'design for effect' school, seemingly without realizing that every one of these detailed considerations are subjectively quantified as a guess to the magnitude of the effect. All of the implied research and sorting out of all the important facets of WW2 combat is totally belied by the ridiculous Surprise rules.

Why have a potentially 6 column Surprise shift, all of equal probability?  Because the game includes a d6, of course! At least a 1 column shift on 1,2, or 3 and a 2 shift on a 4 or 5 with a 3 shift on a 6 would have shown a little thought (although equally arbitrary). And the Designer's Notes claims that even the 6 shift matters very little. So why bother? And why is the CRT so insensitive to column shifts that are so painstakingly produced in the combat calculations?

Hit the wall on page 27. Convoluted logistics just to have them is not only inelegant but also fully demonstrates why wargamers over the decades shunned such 'staff' work. Even the gurus of 'smack the players in the face with a lesson' at SPI figured this out after Campaign for North Africa.

All smoke and mirrors, a complex facade masking a pile of guesswork.

It is quite humorous that notes suggest rolling 3 dice at once in some instances to speed play; probably a savings of 0.1% in play time.

Not impressed so far.

Very much enjoyed this game in Essen, and played it three times. It has a nice tight feel, very well playtested, very thematic, and just a great playing experience - with a mixture of fun and medium-weight play; and a teeny bit of take that. Recommended!

The game has the originality of being competitive while at the same time trying to avert the opening of the gates to the other world.

Unfortunately I was not really interested in the gameplay.

the game has some good systems in it : action order, forming of the menhirs but on the other hand game play is very dry and long for this kind of game. The design is nice, but it will not hit the table again soon.

Tentative rating. This is a game I would like to try again to be certain of. I think it is a very solid game that many people may enjoy. Does not seem like something I would particularly look forward to playing again.

My copy of the game came with a messed up rulebook, missing the last two pages. SitDown never answered my request for a correct copy...crickets, good thing BGG had it as a PDF download. The English rules are poorly laid out (I work for a German owned company and am all too familiar with the needless complexity Deutch grammer translations can to the simplest directions, which these are not) . Download the Addendum, Erratum and Q&A PDF's at BGG too as you well may need them.
       The Video is incomplete, poor quality and moves WAY too fast. That said you a may need it to explain things that aren't clear in the rulebook, plan on pausing lots and multiple viewings.

My house rule:
       When laying out the tiles I only shuffle 5 of them leaving the movement tile first in line, if you can't place your druids early in the round then very often no amount of strategy helps anyone.

       Has anyone thought of rule modifications for a cooperative game? I may get back on that thought later....

Some people describe it here as worker placement game, but this is not the gist of the matter. It is rather a sequential action selection mechanic, aka you program 5 actions to be resolved. As there are a lot of traits you can emerge giving you more points when capturing a monster etc. This sounds as careful planning would be rewarded, following a solid strategy will lead to victory? Nope. As the author throwed in some action cards (no hand limit) it is not sure that planned actions will have the effect you thought (even when you're first player). The Monster moves, you move your druid to catch it and then an action card of a fellow player moves the monster again so you won't have any points even worse when the monster is near the border, such a card of a fellow player may even make you lose points instead.
Why brain burning the moves if the result is imponderable and arbitrary? None of our group wanted to play again. Sad as there were some interesting ideas but also a lot that turn a euro gamers game into its opposite.

RATING: 7
The theme of druids capturing invading creatures and sealing a magical portal appeals a lot to me (in fact, I've been designing a game with a very similar theme for quite some time), but the game feels a little abstract.

The chore mechanics are an odd mix of worker placement and action programming. Decisions must be carefully calculated, but sometimes an opponent moves a creature  (often by playing a card) and makes you lose actions, potentially destroying much of your strategy for the round. Also, the random order of action resolution set at the beginning of each round makes it impossible to plan for the next round. Otherwise, it's a good game, but the elements of chaos and luck do bring down my rating.

The production is fine, but the choice of wooden pieces for gemstones and menhirs seems somewhat random, as if the publisher just worked with what they could get.

RATING: 6.5
Fine game with a few nice, unique twists. It's also a completely different setting, which is refreshing. There are some small but important rules, so it's not that easy to explain.

If everyone knows the game, it's pretty cool and can get nasty, too. Not too sure about replayability, though. The game itself couldn't be more diversive, but it's still only that much you can do.

RATING: 9.5
Amazing action process system. It changes each turn, you have to adapt on each turn, and on each opponent action. 
See your plans ruined, build new ones. Think, act, and smile when you block others.

Very funny game, deep strategy, not long (1h30 for 4 players)

A must have definitely

RATING: 5
Surprisingly abstract, dry and 'Euro' for a game that has evil creatures invading earth from an underwater city. Mechanically, it's worker placement plus engine building coupled with a board for positional play which is it's most unique aspect and one I normally enjoy. 
Somehow, it didn't quite come together. The worker placement has the interesting twist that the roles change order every round but suffers from each player having five workers. The many places available make this phase haphazard. Strategy of players is determined by five different knowledge (i.e. engine) tracks that have to be advanced selectively to gain more powerful actions. Nothing to write home about. Finally, the whole positional play is ruined for me by klunky rules, especially with respect to the evil creatures.
There's a game and even interesting decisions here, just not for me.

Average game. Don't be fooled by the theme, there is quite a bit of meat in this game. I like the art work and there are some good ideas in the game concept, but it is overal a bit too long and I especially didn't like the player interaction.

Even if I didn't play it for a while (and the game is not great component wise), Karnag is a very good game.
It has placement, programing , possibility to bloc ...

Programming with a twist; you pre-program movement, but also your action selection. The idea is fresh, but there's a bit too much take that and chaos given that the game is otherwise somewhat dry.

RATING: 7
2 Player: too hard to close the gate of Ker Ys, one player might lead early on the VP-track, the other player has no chance to catch up.

It´s better with more players blocking each other on the action cards. 

My first thougt was Karnag being a cooperative fantasy game, but instead it is more a classic worker placement mechanism that really fits to the theme. The game hardly forgives mistakes (first 2P ended 51 to 120 points, I made two big mistakes during programming the actions). 

Really nice material, but some parts are a little too small for big hands. The German rules are really bad, but with a little work and ignoring the examples I finally made it.

Although there is a lot to criticise, I like the game a lot.

Auf einem Spielplan spawnen Monster aus einem Erdspalt, die man daran hindern muss eine Lichtung zu verlassen. Die Spieler bewegen sich mit mehreren Figuren um die Lichtung herum und Versuchen den Spalt zu verschließen indem sie Prismen errichten, die einen Schutzring bilden sollen.

Hmmm... This is a very odd game to rate.  It has some good stuff to it, but the game itself makes like zero sense.  Why can we onky run around the outside?  How can the creatures be so stupid?  Do the menhirs generate a force field or something?  How do gems convert to huge stone monoliths?  The creatures are not nearly intimidating enough... Almost impossible for them to reach the edge.  I expected a desparate struggle against the evil hoardes, but they move like molasses, and in the suggested initial setup, the cannot actually escape in six rounds.  Boring.  It has the feel of people who played Terra Mystica and thought hey'd try to do better.

This is the hit of Essen 2012 for me. It was completely under the radar but what a game. The theme and mechanics mesh together extremely well and the game is different which makes it stand out from the crowd.
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

Rating based on 1 2player game.

Lots of theme to this worker-placement game. A whole lot to do. The goal of the game seems extremely difficult to attain with only 2 players.

Played 2 more times since. With more players the goal may be more easily achievable, but it becomes a lot longer. For being already very heavy (not in thinking, but in mechanics), it sort of becomes a struggle to complete it.

Will give it another chance, but it will likely end up leaving my collection.

Maghi contro creature che spuntano dal centro della terra!! Ok, le tematiche non sono originali, la grafica del tabellone non è esaltante e alcune trovate non sono ambientate, strategicamente però il gioco è ben concepito e le fluide meccaniche permettono molte strategie. Un paio di partite per entrare nei meccanismi ed evitare la frustrante sensazione di aver sprecato azioni a far nulla. Un gioco molto sotovalutato da riprovare che regalerà sicure soddisfazioni agli hard gamers. Durata non eccessiva ma attenti ai fini pensatori.

If you listen to rules, things seems easier to get done then they are in reality. Putting down does menhirs is a fucking hard task and encircling Ker Ys is far from obvious:s Very good game! Only minus point is the movement of the creatures, that's not always clear how they should move.

Karnag is a bit wacky and unintuitive at times. Keeping track of how the monsters move is tricky and they never seem to be a huge threat unless players purposefully let them slip by. End game scoring can be hard to grasp the first couple times you play. Yet, I find myself greatly enjoying this game. I enjoy seeing events unfold and running around the board blasting monsters. I enjoy building pillars for magical barriers. I find myself immersed in the theme of the game, even when the mechanics don't line up perfectly. Overall, I can totally understand why someone else wouldn't rate it as highly, but for me, Karnag is just plain fun.

RATING: 5
Almost purely tactical game of action programming of sorts. As with most games in this genre, it requires careful thought when planning the actions in order to get the desirable result, but other player's actions can have a serious impact on the final effect - it's a game of careful positioning, and landing a square too far or to close will render future actions useless. It's not a light game like Robo Rally, so I find it irritating. Furthermore, what will score at the end of the game depends on the outcome of player's actions, meaning that if you bet wrong on the outcome and pursue the losing strategy, your score will be miserable.

RATING: 4
The movement in this game is really wonky, and I dislike the way the action system works. I think the game would work better if you placed a disc and did it's effect immediately, since you would know whether someone else was blocking you and how much movement you needed. 

This game has a lot of cool ideas, but the movement system and the way the action system ties in with that really hurts the playability of the game.

RATING: 5
Played once with 2P. This is a mash-up of worker placement and a pseudo-tower defense mechanism. There's a strong spatial element to this game, as the druids move along the perimeters of a grid, which seems to be the defining mechanism of this game. It's pretty heavy and abstract, although the unpredictable order of actions makes this game a lot more tactical than strategic. Despite the tight gameplay and mish-mash of some popular Euro mechanisms (tech trees and area majority), there's nothing that makes Karnag particularly memorable in a sea of Euros.

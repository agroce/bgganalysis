Wings of Glory is an incredibly fun game. It is very easy to learn, and newbies can hold their own right from the start. The planes are great, and the game is accessible to young and old alike.

This came into my store today, so I picked it up. Nice to have the latest edition of all (or nearly all) of the rules in one, great-looking booklet. 

Players are also given a new planning board that seems to be an interesting improvement over the old. Basically, it's a kind of bracket with notches that cards for planning and damage fit into. My only complaint is that the stock for these is a bit thin.

I started playing Mustangs and Messerschmitts years ago, and about that same time I was introduced to Fighter pilot and other air to air games.  At the time I thought they were the best games out there...  Then along came Wings of War WW1 and then later WW2 by Nexus games.  Andrea Angiolino and his partner devised and put together an air war game like no other.  After playing it a couple times, I found the rules system simple and easy to learn.  All I needed to do was develop the "Eye" for figuring out where the airplane will end up when I plot it's movement.  That comes with experience.  Overall this is a very easy game to learn and play.  I love the pre-painted aircraft for the game, but sometimes I just cannot help myself and either repaint one or get an alternate source of aircraft and then paint it myself.  That is the model hobbyist in me.

This is a miniatures game I wish I could get to the table more.  It is very easy to pick up and I like that the rules ramp up in complexity, allowing newer players to come into the game with ease.

RATING: 8
Let's rate this 8 after one play with just me and one other player flying two planes. However, this rating could even go up once I get to try this with multiple people. With this game, I suspect it is... the more the merrier.

Wings of Glory is a simple system where you fly planes around on a table top and shoot at each other. It's as simple as that. The game is incredibly easy to pick up, the miniatures look fantastic, and it's hard not to get sucked into the fun of this game.

What I'm admiring most early on is how thoughtfully the rules are staggered. There's basic rules to get started, standard rules for those that have played it a bit, and advanced rules for those that want increased detail like altitude and such. It allows players to customize the game to their preference. Throw in a range of planes that all fly differently, and start to work in some scenarios, and the result is an incredibly flexible game system.

I'm pretty jazzed about this game right now, but I need to get six to the table.

Update: Well, tried an 8 player free for all. That's probably too chaotic. It was hard to read opponents and plan. I'm thinking six max, and probably four players as a possible "sweet spot" for this game.

RATING: 10
An excellent game, which combines fun, speed of play and a sense of verisimilitude.  It just feels right.  It can easily be played solo and works equally well with two players or twenty players.  An impressively elegant game design which creates uncertainty.  Note that the Rules and Accessories Pack contains no planes or manoeuvre decks which need to be bought separately.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Gives you all the support structure to play the game, but leaves which planes up to you (planes with their maneuver decks bought separately).  The game is fairly easy to learn, and can be enjoyed without all the advanced rules if you prefer faster paced games.  Missions give the game more depth, and you can go as big as you like or stay small.  You do not need to buy yet more sets to rebalance badly balanced designs such as happens with X-Wing (really, what moron decided to print the points costs on the cards rather than have a master list that can be rebalanced by a simple printout).  Nor do you accumulate reams of modifier cards that must be catalogued, indexed, and acquired from models you didn't even want.

RATING: 10
It is great to have all the rules for this game contained in a single rulebook.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
SOLO PLAY:

1 Player Minimum
X Player Maximum
(X is the number of planes and players)
This is still worth buying even if you own Wings of War. The rules are very well organized. Divided in sections by basic rules, standard rules, andvanced rules and optional rules. It is easy to find the rules while playing when you need reference. There a few small changes that I look forward to implementing in my games. 

You get 4 damage decks, A, B, C and D. The decks are the same so you can use them with your old decks if you choose. The C damage deck is doubled instead of 17 cards you now have 34, just two of all cards. . 

The exhaustive rules on Ace Skills is fabulous and the game comes with Ace Skill tokens and recovery counters.

RATING: 10
WWI airplanes make great models for tabletop gaming. Preprogrammed movement done through the use of an individual plane's specific manoeuver cards. Basic simplicity makes it highly accessible for any number of players. Big difference in rating v. Wings of War Famous Aces is that using miniatures in WoW was originally optional, while in WoG it seems mandatory.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
In ways I like this better than XWing or Attack Wing. The game that inspired many after is an elegant system that does away with a lot of hassle and clunkiness. A straight up dogfight that welcomes customization and playing as you want. It doesn't worry about points or try to create balance, you just throw some planes down and go at it...And that lack of BS and fuss is what makes it great. But that's also what kept it pretty limited as far as growth. WW1 isn't Star Wars or Star Trek. People want points to make sure the games are "balanced". And scenarios require creativity. So a game that you can truly make your own gets largely ignored which is a shame.

Emphasises maneouvre over meta-builds and dice rolling.  For this reason it's a better game than X-Wing although the immediate kill card is egregious.

4mm thick paperback rulebook, 4 damage decks, 2 sheets of counters and some really flimsy card management punch-outs for £20+? 

No aircraft, no maneuver decks. 

I think it's a bit steep but I'm not going to fault the rules themselves as they give a great 'lightweight' game.

Fast playing, lots of options and a smart and SOLITAIRE friendly game design.

If yes, you should really consider this game.

Owned the card game version many moons ago. But the chance to push little planes around the table with my 9 year old while telling him a bit of WWI history, was too much to resist! He is really interested in the world wars, (and sharks!)so it should be encouraged.

I will be getting, in the full compliment of 3's,

Right after Heroscape, this is my all-time favorite game.
I'm fascinated with WWI and biplanes, open cockpits, unimaginably brave men who fought these insane battles on the ground and in the air.

As well, collecting the miniatures allows me to indulge my biplane fascination without having to construct and build models. I did try kit building for a while and realize it wasn't for me. So Wings of Glory allows me to own beautiful little planes and also play with them with family and friends.

Game play is simultaneous and there's virtually no downtime for players.
I've never used the altitude rules, but do occasionally use the special damages with players who are more familiar with the game system.

I also own:
WW1 - Special Packs
WW1 - Ace Cards promo pack
WW1 - Airplane packs

I like the easy-to-learn game mechanisms combined with the story-drama of the aerial combat.  I also greatly appreciate the modular nature of the rules; you can scale it up and down in complexity to suit the players' interest and age.  Introducing mission ideas or throwing in complications or new elements is fun.  It's a great way to game casually, without worrying about scores and points, but instead paying attention to trying to survive a dogfight in the sky.  Lovely models, too.  In addition, it has prompted me to start reading up on WW1 planes and pilots, about which I knew next to nothing before getting into this game.  It's been fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
While you will need at least one plane per side in addition to this box, if you want to maximise enjoyment this set provides the full rules with options as well as counters and other accessories for 4 models to be used at once.  Note that adding the altitude optional rules will make for much more nuanced game play but will extend the time for a game as pilots jockey for position.  I am planning to run a big game later this year for friends.

With this set you can play with your old Wings of War planes or pick up a few of the Wings of Glory planes and your ready to go. Good table-top rules set for WWI dog fights.

One of the most enjoyable and sociable games that I ever played! A basic set of rules and game mechanisms that are very easy and fast to master but still allows you to perform advanced manoeuvres as well as (the need of) thinking tactically.

The 1:144 scale miniature WWI aircrafts are truly beautiful, from the small one-seaters in the early WWI era like the Fokker E.III, the Morane-Saulnier Type N and the Airco DH.2 to the classic aircrafts like the Fokker Dr.I, D.Va & D.VII to the Sopwith Camels, the SPAD XIII and the Nieport 28. Then you also have a large collection of two-seaters, sea-planes, heavy bombers and the majestic Zeppelin Stakken R.VI bomber.

"Wings of Glory" is a highly recommended tabletop miniature tactical game of WWI air combat.

I've picked up both Duel Packs, as well as the Breguet BR.14 B2 (de Greffier & Marseille) and the Rumpler C.IV C. (MFFA 2) for $5 each.  This is a really great system, and makes me wish I knew 5 other light-hearted gamers with whom I could go to battle and have a laugh at the whims of fortune!  The gorgeous aircraft are what draw me specifically to the WWI setting (as opposed to Wings of Glory: WWII or Star Wars: X-Wing - which I don't think ever properly credited its predecessors), though the biggest draw-back with WWI is that the small cards are fairly limiting in allowing much variability in speed or maneuverability.  But it's perfect for allowing players to spend an hour with gorgeous models (no, not THAT type of gorgeous model) recreating the derring-do of the original Knights of the Sky!  Game design: 4/5  Personal enjoyment: 4/5  Total: 8/10

This is a very affordable way to get into the game. You get all the rules and counters and some cards to play with. But honestly, the game is not as much fun without the models and the toy factor. But I really like it that you can get into this system without spending 100 bucks and that you can then just expand it with any models you like.
The system itself is great and honestly I do not understand why it gets so low ratings here on BGG while Star Wars X-Wing (which is based on the same system) is still the hottness...

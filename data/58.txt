I bought the original game, decided to sell it because I had another tile-laying game (Settlers), regretted it, traded to get it back years later. Sat down to play it once and the kids thought it was too complicated for that day. Still haven't played a whole game. But I own it, by gum!

You're a warlord controlling armies of odd and unusual creatures which you send into battle against your opponents creatures. Very cool idea for a game but it was a bit long and there were often endgame problems, specifically kingmaker issues. I'd love to see this redone to meet todays level of game design.

[Update]
So now the game has been redone by Z-Man. Based on an brief look at the rules I'd say this still has the same problem it used to, especially in 3 and 4 player games. If player A attacks player B then the best move for player C is to attack the looser of the first battle. This ultimately leads to a game of turtling.

Boardgame version of Kong of the Tabletop. Artworks isn't quite as good (most creatures copied from Trampier originals), but love the variable hex board. Fun to try and bluff with creatures you can't support.
Edit: Should specify that I am talking about the artwork in the Games Workshop edition. I haven't played the german (pegasus) edition, which does look like it has lovely art.

Kings & Things is a fantasy wargame for 2 to 4 players. It is a world of varied terrains and magical items, of mythical beasts and valiant heroes, of Grand Dukes and Master thieves. You play a minor noble, vying for control of the broken kingdom of Kadab.  And like all minor nobles, what you want to be most is a major noble and then KING! To accompish your divine task you must expand your control of the varied lands of Kadab, increase your income, muster rag-tag armies of motley creatures that are willing to join your cause, recruit powerful heroes to lead them. Build towers, castles and finally a citadel to establish your base of power. But watch out! Those other players are under the impression that it is their divine right. And they have the same chance to recruit armies and steal away your loyal troops.

Expected playing time is about 1.5 to 2 hours.

A very fun, strategic game with a good deal of humor as well. The pieces are somewhat fiddly, but I guess that's a necessary part of the game! :-) Also, the pinning rule can be abused quite a lot, so we simply make the pinning work on a 1 for 1 basis, which works out well.

One of the "old" games from the 80ies.
I have some really funny memories with the game. When my friend explained the rules always when they were useful for him or in disadwantage for the others....
Therefore Kings and Thinks was often mentioned when someting similar happened in other games.
Due to the tiny cards and the amount of special rules the game is a little bit too fidley to play it today, therefore my low ranking.

Tentative rating after one play.  Actually a fun little civ building game.  Do not play this with hard core eurogamers, they'll be disappointed by the high luck factor.  

One downside is that 4 players is the sweet spot and is highly encouraged in the text.

After our first play, there were some who wanted to play it again the same weekend.  I'm looking forward to this to see whether there's a little more strategy to it than we played with.  My one concern is the game devolving to single large stacks to conquer other's citadel's.

Playing a german edition of this is a headache, on the other hand the monster names are great.

Have the original King of the Tabletop from the Dragon magazine but no one wants to play something that doesn’t look good (shallow, superficial modern gamers!) so this on 60% off was way to go - no way full price!
I may use bits from this to play original King of the Tabletop - played this in eighties and thought the board was an unecessary complication for an elegantly simple game.

No electronic copy of rules available (except for a scan of the old rules in the links section) but there is a complete scan of its progenitor [thing=2252][/thing] in its file section.

Like all Tom Wham's games this is a light-hearted romp.  It has a little more depth than most of his games but still should not be taken seriously.

The rules are especially amusing; during the game your "recruits" are pulled from a cup and eliminated units are re-cycled back into the same cup.  The rules refer to the inhabitants (recruits) referrring to "The Great Cup In The Sky". 

Sadly the game doesn't really work with 2 or 3 so requires 4 for a decent game.  It's also probably a little long for what it is.

Tile laying Games Workshop production which requires some time spent with the rule book before you kick off. Worth the effort

Unfortunately on 26-11-2009, BGG were instructed to remove all uploaded files all all GW games. Even those files with no copyrite material.

The games might be OK but the company attitude to it's customers is definitely broken. All my GW game ratings are reduced to '1's until GW mend their piss poor attitude to their client base and files are allowed to be reinstated..

This is a very, very fun game.  At first I was afraid that the rules would be too complex, but with the player's summaries from the 'Geek it wasn't bad at all.  The game is actually fairly simple, and a good time was had by all.  The two-player version seems to work well, and I think I prefer it over the increased chaos from multiple players.

It is a bit long for what it is, for all that it is fun.

Tom Wham strikes again!  Fun little wargame, good replay value since the map is never the same and you draw your 'things' from a cup.  It would score higher if the endgame didn't draw out so much and it takes soooo long.  Best with more than 2 players.

I can’t help but think Kings & Things is Titan Lite: in both you move stacks of hero-led units, some of whom with special attacks, through a map and fight the other players’ armies; the one notable difference is the board, Kings & Things’ modular hexes making the game easier.

Anyhow, I like both games: I only think that Kings & Things, if played with the new «still one round after the first citadel has been built» rule, is more likely to hit table simply because it now plays much faster than Titan.

This is a game of exploration, expansion, exploitation, and extermination (4X), but with some twists and tongues firmly planted in cheeks. An interesting mix of varied terrain hexes is randomly constructed at game start. The many counters representing creatures, special characters, resources and spells are all drawn out of a hat according to a schedule that encourages expansion and conquest. 

Creature counters stay inverted until revealed and must have associated terrain support to be effective thus bluff figures largely in this game as well.

The winner is the player first able to build his home stronghold to the highest level (there are four levels). If more than one player achieves this goal on the same turn (what usually happens), then a knock-down, drag-out "last man standing" player elimination will decide the winner (the latest edition has modified that somewhat by allowing victory to the first player to acquire two citadels - the second would have to be by conquest).

I think of this as a lighter, faster (but not by much unless someone manages a sudden death victory) and more accessible version of "Titan," and one with a definite attitude and fun factor.

Es un juego de civilización y exploración. El objetivo es construir y mantener durnate un turno una ciudadela. LAs construcciones van mejorándose por niveles, y se parte de torre, a torreón, castillo y ciudadela.

Tiene de original el tema de las tropas que se utilizan. Se usan bocaabajo, y cuando entras en combate con alguién, si ese alguien se da cuenta, aquellas tropas que tengas y para las que no poseas el control de una loseta de terreno apropiada desaparece. Osea, que hay mucho bluffing. Puede parecer que llevas mucha gente y resulta que es todo humo.

Hay mucha variedad de unidades. También hay eventos, tesoros, heroes y magias.  Puede resultar algo caótico, y como es un "todos contra todos", si destacas pronto puede ser contraproducente. 

El tablero es modular, construido con losetas hexagonales. Cada turno tiene 9 fases (algunas opcionales). Está entretenido. Surge el conflicto en poco tiempo, y tiene bastante interacción.

Played faster than I remembered the WE version doing so.
May just be in two though. I remember four players feeling

Provides cute situations to try and optimize in, with
enough luck to ensure it is not pure calculation.

(as the rules say). This ruins the game.

Has the interesting mechanic of only allowing players to control units native to your already conquered terrain types or if a leader of that type has been recruited.

Yet another one to go in my purge of multiplayer games.  Wasn't that great of a game to begin with.

Tried to sell on both Ebay and CSW, no interest even at low prices, so threw it away after taking the counters out and putting them in my King of the Tabletop copy.

I think today's high shipping prices are making it difficult to sell games, since a game someone might pay $25 for, is not a game they will pay $40 for due to shipping. And it's not worth my time to sell, pack, ship,  and pay fees on games for $10.

This is mostly from my memory of only 6-8 games a looong time ago.
Rated this a nostalgic 7 "while it should be a 6".
It is funny, original and has sound interesting tactical concepts.
And at its time an overlooked top game IMHO.
But the random element which is fantasic for a family game will be a bit too high for most "serous games" and it usually takes too long for what it is (if you have several players evenly matched afair longer than say Puerto Rico, Caylus, Castles of Burgundy, Terraforming Mars). Kingmaking is quite possible.
The big fun for families will be the early exploration phase where you find Things, but moving can be pretty challenging/exciting into the late game.. only this can become very late.

Light, low-maintenence free-for-all. 
 
Every bit as good as Game of Thrones, Twilight Imperium, Age of Mythology, or whatever multi-player free-for-all is in vogue at the moment. Still suffers from all the typical problems of every other multiplayer free-for-all [inevitable whine-fest].
 
The original King of the Tabletop feels superior to me; directed attacks reduce the bickering over turf; pay-to-attack reduces opportunism, and there's something pleasing about seeing your kingdom on your own playing mat. YMMV.

Some lovely production in this game.  The arrangement of hex tiles always makes for a different game.  Lots of fun units to play.  Luck, and knowledge of the best mercenaries is probably a little too important to the gameplay though.

I want to love this game, especially with the updated pegasus version, however Tom Wham's design, like most of them are kind of an evolutionary mid-step towards the modern day eurogame.  They all have simple mechanics that are kind of interesting, but you have to churn through them over and over and over again to see who shakes out on top.  Sold my copy eventually.

RATING: 8
Funny dicefest. The game "seems" strategic, but the luck is omnipresent - from drawing your territories to drawing your armies to throwing your dice in battle. However, it has an almost addictive feel to it - and it's funny enough so most of my friends tend to ask for it. The main drawback is the length - with 4 players, if 2 people build their citadels, prepare for a 5-6 hours struggle for power...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The feel (light and fluffy) doesn't match the mechanics (eg very important locking rules) and there is a real end game probelem, either the game will end fairly quickly if one person gets their Citadel far enough ahead of everyone else but once another Citadel is built the game d\rags on and on and on.

Haha, funny game. Killer-penguins, Sir Lanc-E-Lot, Icedragons, Terrain-Lords, and lots of other strange creatures with even stranger habits. This game is a nice "hex-and-counter" game with a wonderful Fog-of-War implementation. You can hold armies of illusory creatures that threaten and battle your opponents as long as no-one realizes that they don't truly exist. A nice bluff-war-build-and-conquer-game Always good for a laugh.

My number of plays is a low estimation for plays when I was younger back home. I finally got it back to the table after all these years. Turns out it's neither as long or complex as it can seem from reading the old-school rulebook, but it also wasn't as fun (at least for the others) as I remembered it. It needs a vigorous streamlining, though there are some fun mechanisms and I'll always love the theme and art.

Kings & Things doesn't quite work because the movement and turn order rules make it impossible to defend your land effectively.  With a re-vamped movement system, this could be a charming game.  Here's my first attempt . . .  First change: all units (even fliers) must stop when entering enemy territory or unexplored territory, even if there are no enemy units currently residing in the territory.  Fliers can cross water spaces and count all terrain as one space, but in other respects are identical to non-fliers.  Second change: each unit entering an enemy-occupied space pins two enemy units to the space.  The pinned player may choose which units are pinned, and he may choose bluff units if he wishes.  Previously, as little as one wimpy unit was able to immobilize an entire hex's worth of enemy units - a horrible rule that crippled the game.  Kings & Things is also in need of revised victory conditions, especially with these proposed reductions in mobility, which would make capturing an enemy citadel harder.

The key to this game are the 'Things'.  A motley selection of fantastical creatures that make up your armies.  However, the game can drag a little at times, with no-one able to dominate enough to actually win, and despite the variety of creatures and changing board, it can feel like you've seen all the game has to offer after a few plays.  House rule - the camel can fly.

An all time favorite.  This is a game with echoes of many other games that derive from it-- most obviously SETTLERS OF CATAAN, but also a few other tile-building, economic style Euros.  Just ahead of its time, I guess.  The Tom Wham artwork version is THE version to get.

in 2011, I picked up the Z-Man Games version, courtesy of a Tanga Deal.  So now I own an old WEG copy and a new Z-Man copy.  I've played it recently, and I'm downgrading it a tick because the mechanics which seemed so awesome in the early 90s now seem a little more humdrum to me.

A fun game that seemed pretty complicated when reading the rules for the first time, but while playing, turned out to be relatively light after all. I enjoyed drawing lots of "things" from the bag, especially the different creatures. The fighting in this game is simple, but fun nonetheless. In the end it is an area control game though, a genre which I'm not too fond of, so it won't see that much play even though I kind of like it.

I'm happy to see some of those fun old school games come back. They are still fun to throw on the table even though they may not be as "streamlined" as most modern games. 

Kings and Things didn't last nearly as long as we anticipated it was actually over fairly quickly. You can win this game without much conflict but there is a good chance your opponents won't let that happen but that's part of the fun and the expectation you should have going in.

Ken:
Very nice artwork, components, and fun bluff-heavy gameplay.  Pleasant introduction to some wargaming elements for folks interested in theme and lighter-style gameplay.  2-player lends itself to run-away victory; requires 3+ players for a competitive game.

Would be happy to play again with 3+ players.  No chance of future re-acquisition.

Classic hex-tile battle game with a sense of humor.  Another fun game from the days before GW was all about selling those stupid miniatures.  The sequence takes a little while to get down and play can be slow at first but once you get used to this game it realy grows on you.  Haven't tried the German version, hopefully the English language version will be re-issued.

Here is the best way to see this game - imagine you are in a land of magical creatures and heroes and you are surrounded by foes with diabolical armies of the same (you have to assign good & evil liberally here).  Can you raise a force and lead it valiantly against the foes and drive them off so that your land reigns triumphantly?  If you want to try, this is for you.

For a dice fest this has a really good design.  Players protect their kingdoms and march their armies (things) out on a modular hex board.  Each hex represents a region-type (swamp, tundra, forest, etc.) and you must have control the region-type your monsters come from in order to use them in battle.  Lots of flavour: spells, special strengths, movement capabilities & creative creatures on the chits.  This game virtually makes Titan obsolete.

It is quite a serious strategy game. 
The illustrations and the tongue-in-cheek tone used in the rulebook make it sound like a casual Munchkin style game, which it is not.
You also have to deal with the luck of dice rolling and drawing things from the bag.
And if a game is not over in one hour, it is likely to take three hours of attrition warfare. 
Still, I like the game.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
First impression: I've only played one game with two players. The game shows a bit old school board game design. You draw tiles from a bag that contains monsters, income tiles, events and magical items and you can either get lucky or not with them. Magic items and events are pretty strong and some monsters you draw you may not be able to utilize (but you can exchange tiles 2-to-1). Monster you can place on board but face down. You'll move them face down and only reveal them when they fight (against other player or when discovering new tiles). 

The part I like is that only then you must be able to "support" them by controlling land the monster likes to live in (there are 7 different). If you have powerful creature but no support then it's too bad as you lose it. Because of secret nature of the creatures and the fact you might need to control some lands that you really wouldn't want to the game feels on-the-edge most of the time. One player wins if he is able to upgrade one of his buildings into a citadel and keep it one whole round. Not a simple task with more than one opponent for sure. 

Overall there are maybe a bit too many rules to remember if you don't play this game too often. You can also hurt or gain a lot by drawing a bad/good set of tiles. With two players the amount of chaos is manageable not sure how well it works with 3 or more players. It may not sound like it but I liked the game as it is a fun experience.

Another GW game in my collection that I really enjoy. In some ways it has a Titan feel as you are building up armies of various creatures to conquer your enemies, but the random board setup and endgame requirements makes this a more enjoyable game for me. The combat is light and there is randomness in counter draws, but that keeps the game moving fairly quickly and suspenseful.

I wish I had a group that embraced this. I think this is a fun game.

Things to remember for next time:

1. INCOME must be 15/20 to be able to build citadel. Can't build just because you have the money
2. Black cloud goes with weather control
3. Villages and towns go in bag. You CAN have these and a fortress in same hex, but only one special income counter.
4. Units ARE supported as long as you have control of their relevant land. It can be in very back of your control, or you have a relevant terrain lord with them.
5. When cities/fortresses are neutralized- they take damage test at end of combat to see if survive or not

Edit: second playthough with 4 players was better. the rules are clunky, but its a fun game.

The game is good, really. We played a 3-player game and it took three hours - it's just too long for what it is. I really liked the idea and variability in the game but this is something that Nexus Ops does in one hour. Ok, Nexus Ops doesn't have all the magic items and events and stuff, but they are not that essential.

Combat system is simplified a lot. Some happy dice rolling. Some magic items unbalance the combat scale sometimes just too much. That's one con with those babies.

I might be lured to try this again as a 2-player game but NEVER with four players. Three was enough already...

The luck factor is high because the battle system is what it is. Nevertheless a (kinda long) game that can give you an entertaining evening.

I bought this BITD when GW published it. Loved it for the art (which in common with a lot of people it seems I incorrectly attributed to the designer Tom Wham) and the humour (definitely Wham). I think I also however appreciated it for the game play. This might have been the nearest to a traditional war game that I played the most back then (probably a good dozen to twenty plays 2p and 3p). Recently picked up the Z-Man edition cheap (£10) and am reminded how much I like this game. Which is quite a lot. Necessary variant - take turns making one move at a time, then resolve fights (but allow blocking as per rules, unlike other foolish suggestions here on the geek)

It might rate higher if not for the play time (I would reckon on 4 hours), but once in a while it is just a fun game. Kind of an old-school type game - lots of chits, lots of roling dice to resolve conflicts, but it is a nice combination of exploration, managing your resources and planning your attack and defence.  Some nice little rules (like the terrain requirements and pinning rules) put it above a simple and tedious exercise.  A couple of the magic items are a little annoying and of course dice luck can be a huge factor but these are minor quibbles for the most part.  And the artwork and some of the unit names are just entertaining, even after many plays.  Beware the Killer Penguins!

What a classic!  This steals everything worthwhile about about Titan and mixes in chaos and a ton of fun and wraps them up with the then innovative mechanics.  I rather love the whole system.

Certainly, there is a lot of luck here, and a bunch of silly bits with silly rules, but for some reason, I never really felt out of control.  There are always options to take to keep most everything in balance.

My only issue with the game is that there needs to be some new endgame conditions otherwise it can suffer from Kingmaking or just be prone to outstay its welcome.  Use the variant where the game ends when two people build a citadel the player that earns the most wins.  A real beauty.

UPDATE: Well the new game fixed the old endgame problem!  Yay!  Sadly, I also think that this game is feeling its age.  The game still suffers as there is a bit of a protracted endgame where the stragglers have no chance to win and hold on just to continue to play.  I really love the first 2/3rds of the game, but it just kind of falls apart when you wreck your neighbors and you know that they aren't having a good time anymore.

Lovely artwork and a game which I really wanted to like, but I never became a fan. There's always the danger of player-elimination or near-player-elimination & it's very difficult or even impossible to get back in the game after a bitter defeat. The endgame is also disappointing.

This is a really good, area control game! You have a huge assortment of 'things' that you will be drawing blindly out of a bag. The 'things' can consist of magical items, creatures that will fight for you, special income chits that can be placed in areas on the map or even some random events! You never quite know what you will get! 

The creatures that fight for you have to be supported (you need to control a specific terrain for them) & if you can't, you may place them face down (you could do this even with creatures that are supported) until you need to resolve a combat. An interesting aspect of the game is that when you flip over 'bluff' creatures & you don't control the terrain they need, you need to remove them but ONLY if another player notices that you don't have that terrain. If they don't notice, you continue using them until you do!

Overall, the game is fantastic!

RATING: 7
A bloody fun and competitive game of warring kingdoms and conquering armies.

It's starting to show its age compared to other newer Fantasy War Boardgames and can overstay its welcome when a session stretches on too long but despite some shortcomings K&T is a tongue in cheek and often hilarious game to play... I mean, where else will you command an army of flying squirrels to defend against a horde of killer penguins?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
A game that was ahead of it's time with the random hex board generation a la Catan.  Then there's the character recruitment reminiscent of Titan.  It's too bad it usually devolves into waiting for everyone else to be too weak to prevent a bid for the win.  You gotta love the Tom Wham flavor and graphics.  How cool are disasters like 'The Teenie Pox' and magic spells like 'The Big Juju'?

RATING: 7.25
This is a fantastic game combining humorous art for the counters, a combat system that works quickly and enjoyably and a map system that forces you into multiple battles and encounters (due to the size, you are quickly forced into each others faces, and it is really difficult to defend all of your fronts.) The bluffing is great. You can come from behind to take victory, which is great!
However, some of the rules for single counters are just too long.

Reyes & Things es un juego clásico de Tom Wham en guerra reinos en un mundo de fantasía y las legiones de las cosas que habitan en ellos. La junta está hecha de azulejos hexagonales, lo que permite un diseño de la placa diferente cada vez. La utilización de un elemento contador volteado interesante, los jugadores intentan a cabo una farol otra con respecto a los tipos de cosas que tienen en sus ejércitos.

While playing you this game you gain a sense that anything can happen. Some criticize it as too random and can drag on a bit at the end, but I think that's a small price to pay for unexpected events. It seems lately games cater to strategies that can be memorized. This game is different. To enjoy Kings & Things embrace the world that unfolds around you. Hang on for a fantastic adventure and, ultimately, a joyous romp.

Classic dudes-on-a-map gameplay.  Control enough territory to build and hold a Citadel.  It's very clear that this is rooted in the 1980s, as its gameplay and light fantasy theme fit with the tastes of the time.  The game has mostly aged well.  The Zman version is a gorgeous production with tons of plastic and very thick cardboard.  The art is also wonderful, though the graphic design could have been improved with things like movement cost indicators and better player aids.  The rules also have a few minor holes in them, but as long as you're playing with a group that's looking to be as whimsical as the game is, it doesn't matter.  If you're starving for some fun, lighthearted conquering, this is a good choice.

A game that might once have been good.  It has not, in my opinion, aged well.  As a two player game, there is too much luck.  As a four player game, I just can't see it coming to the table over just about any more recent multi-player "Euro-wargame".

RATING: 3.5
It must be America's rekindled romance with zombie flicks that prompted Z-Man to resurrect this ancient corpse, as the reprint decision surely wasn't driven by the game's shining gameplay.

The game does have some things going for it, though.  The use of hidden units in a multiplayer war game is unique, but the analogy that ultimately applies is that playing Kings & Things is like playing a block game where (a) all of the blocks are face down, so that players are incessantly flipping game pieces to check and recheck where everything is, and (b) reinforcements are drawn randomly each turn from a recruitment pool in which unit quality ranges from awesome to completely useless.

Without any exaggeration whatsover, I'd like to drive home the point that the need to constantly recheck the identity of units before, during, and after movement easily adds 30 minutes to the game's playtime.  The genius who solves this logistical annoyance will have a load of cash coming his way.

Unit shuffling aside, there are plenty of gaming issues in K&T that get in the way of fun.  Units must be spread evenly across the terrain types to protect the support of existing units, for example, since a player's unsupported units vanish when revealed.  That makes it tough for a player to decisively crush an opponent without opening up his/her territory to invasion by other players.

Also, to rehash the groove of my favorite broken record, a game this long (2-3 hours) shouldn't force elements as critical as player-hosing events, cash rewards, and hero recruitment to be resolved via die rolls and random chit pulls.  To maintain any sense of fun whatsover, the more random the gameplay, the shorter the game should be.

Another issue: Players can get repeatedly knocked back to prevent them from winning, without any one player making any real progress towards ending the game.  This points to the need for sort of timing mechanism to JUST MAKE IT STOP.

To conclude, Kings & Things is another example of a game that fails to beat out Nexus Ops as the light- to middleweight multiplayer conflict game of choice.  If a particular title is neither shorter nor more fun than Nexus Ops - and Kings & Things is neither - then why bother?

Or if it's randomness you want, get yourself a copy of the recent Cosmic Encounter re-release.  It's tons more fun than K&T and a much shorter game, to boot.

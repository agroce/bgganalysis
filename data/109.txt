[initial rating: 7.5] Haven't played it in a long time, and I suspect if I did, my rating for this one would drop.  Still, cool tiles and definitely better with Greg Schloesser's variant(s).

[years later]

Dropped my rating, traded away my copy.  Still on okay game, but it "aged" - wasn't special enough, and got eclipsed by hundreds of other good games that came after it.

Very light auction game. Problem is that most tiles are worth the same for most players. Still there are some tactical decision to be made. The hidden auction is pretty unpredictable but leaves some room for screwage. OK intoductory auction game for younger children.

modded with Dorn´s Robber Knights and Greg Schlosser´s Rule update for the saboteur. New rules to write, but plays good after 1st test play.

RATING: 6.5
A small piece of art, more than a board-game. :) At its base it is a slim auction game based on few rules, but the quality of the tiles is astonishing. Very "fetish". ;)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Decent little game, simple and extremely accessible, but probably lacking the depth required for most "serious" gamers. Definately not highly replayable in any case, as there just isn't that much complexity in the "valuation" algorithm (that is to say, on average, a given tile is going to be worth more or less the same thing to most of the players).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Ok for a light bidding game.  Players bid on various town pieces in order to build up a town worth the most points.  There are various things to consider for each town tile, since tiles will give you income, defense, points, or some combination of those things.  Also some opportunity for screwage with the sabatuer.

Good, short and simple game. The Protective-Shield rule may sometimes lead to lots of beating for the weakest player (smallest number of shields loses one card). Extra scoring rules should have been printed on the screens.

under-rated game. Have thoroughly enjoyed it each time it has come ought. We play with a variant that the income is 3 regardless of the number on the die showing, otherwise a string of luck could make or break you.

RATING: 5.5
I really want to like this, but its showing it's age.  I think if it had been conceived 5 or 6 years later than it was, it might really be wonderful.   The income system is wildly unbalanced, leaving too much of the game to the luck of the die (I like luck, but this can swing too much).  There are systems in place to counter poor rolls, namely sabotage and the card auction, but neither works as well as could be.  The sabotage counters allow a player to target another's buildings for destruction unless the saboteur can be bribed away.  However, the saboteur can only target the player with the fewest shields, who is more often than not the weakest player, or the one with the least available cash.

I have only played this once many years ago (1998) and I enjoyed it.  But at that time, I enjoyed every Euro game I played because the whole world was still so magical to me. I haven't had the chance to play it again.

An interesting auction game where you try to build the most beautiful city. Can drag a bit at times but usually fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Almost clever city building game.  Players bid on city section tiles that will earn them more money and points.  Seems to be some rich-get-richer problems, and nothing to stop powerful players stomping weaker players.  There are some variants out there that try to fix these issues.

I simply always liked this game. Bet for the known tile or hidden tile and make sure you have the corner towers already at hand for the last round.
It is not the heaviest of all games, but very enjoyable.

I kept rolling for sabotage counters, and could only use them on one person, which felt unfair.  A game in need of some tweaks, would play again with changes.

RATING: 6.5
An auction game, which I'm always bad at, but the intervening years have made me a better player and I enjoyed this much more today. Simple choices, a certain screwage (you can directly attack opponets buildings), but it plays well and I had a good time. I've added 0.5 to my rating.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Might feel a little dated, but for its time it was a nice whimsical bidding game.  Players collect tiles to build up their castle walls.  However, there is something odd about the rules that makes the game feel broken.  I can't put my finger on it but I think it's preventing balance.  Perhaps a clever tweak of the rules will make this title run a lot smoother.  Grade: C-

Quite a strange little auction game,where it is possible to bid on either a known or an unknown tile.  So, it's entirely possible you are bidding on something that will only hurt you.  Very pretty, but the random bidding is not really a good idea. (1 play)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
With the rules as written (well, translated from German) this game really bombed for us. The visible auctions stalled whenever a bad tile came up (a tower end of city hall that everyone had) and the blind auctions turned into too much of a crapshoot where you didn't know if you were staying in for a chance at something useful or would end up landed with one of the aforementioned bad tiles.

RATING: 6
Modern Art lite: On your turn you want to choose the tile that the most other people will want and will get into a bidding war to buy (making you money), NOT the tile that you want to buy. The hidden tile auction is different --you don't announce the tile type until the second round of bidding starts. Beautiful tiles,but the game mechanics are dated the game and needs updating.

Would love to see the designer use today's game mechanics to reuse the artwork tiles.

Nice city-building game.  Very "tweakable".  I own the first edition, Teutopolis from Historien Spiele Galerie.  It has some neat ideas that are a bit different than Wettstreit der Baumeister from Kosmos.

Thanks to Joe Huber for allowing me to reacquire this edition.  Teutopolis is the 1st edition of Wettstreit der Baumeister.  It is a good game, and a fairly coherent game form Jean du Poel.  (Often he leaves me wondering if I am playing the game he intended.)

And now I own the deluxe version!  Happy dance!

Nice game.  The components are well made, if a little drab.  Lots of little rules tend to be forgotten during play, and there's a tendency to forget how final scoring works with completed cities.  Still, it's a good game and one I wish got played more.
[b]UPDATE:[/b] Enjoying this one more.  Now that we understand all the rules, it becomes a sort of race to build your city quickly but efficiently.  Raising my rating.

This game is pretty much straight auctions, but it has a nice feel to it.  The tiles and money screens are really quite attractive.  The game is made much better with the addition of the various rules compiled from rec.games.board.  The various end game bonuses almost always are the deciding factor in determining the winner.

RATING: 6
Not bad, even with the official rules, but certainly not great either.  The auctioning part consumes much more time than the more interesting city-building (and blowing up) part.  Also, the rolling for income can create wide discrepancies between the players' cash hoards, which weakens an auction-based game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
For some reason, this doesn't get played as often as it should, considering its popularity among our local gaming group. Inevitably, then, we forget a few rules each time we play and vow to get it right the next time! A nice mix of auction, building and timing that deserves more recognition. One of the true "hidden gems" in our hobby.

We played a mixture of variants and the game worked.  I found it difficult to value the buildings. Their face value is the first indication, but getting the lower valued buildings required to get the bonus points complicates the valuation. Interesting, without being riveting. 

It’s a big round-table auction fest with unfortunately not much more to mix it up except the occasional attempted whacking at someone else’s collection. It could rise in the ratings if repeat playings pique the valuation adjustment sensibilities ... but it hasn't received the chance to date.

RATING: 5
This auction game has some blind bidding, and some not-blind bidding.  However, since having multiples of certain buildings is bad, you could end up bidding on stuff that can only hurt you.  Additionally, once everyone had one of the restricted buildings, another one could come up that no one wants.  Was not a big fan.

Initially this game took a while before I saw the fun in it, but after all players are familiar with the game and its mechanisms, it really starts to shine. Be sure to use at least the sabotage variant. A very good auction/building game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The income element is a bit random and can lead to frustration, but the game is pretty solid.  There is a good bluffing element with the blind auctions (which was considered too much of an element of luck by someone I played it with). It wouldn't be my first choice, though.

Reading about the sabotage involved in the rules, I knew this wouldn't be a mechanic enjoyed in the family setting so this game sat on the shelf unplayed, and the number of variants bounced about on the net means not many people are happy with the design as released, so another reason why I couldn't be bothered to give it a go. From a superficial impression it seems to be similar to Palazzo (probably an unfounded comparison) which I'd rather play. No regrets in donated the game.

RATING: 8.5
Wettstreit der Baumeister -- When the winner of an auction can't pay the price, he loses all his money.  This is not sufficient disincentive for people who have very little money.  Also, limiting the saboteur to the city with the lowest shield count, while providing incentive for building shields, seems too heavy a penalty for those who have been unable to build enough shields.  Still,  I love this game.

I'd like to try a variant wherein a player can bid no more than one (or two) Taler(s) more than he has.  This would both retain some jeopardy and moderate it.

RATING: 5.5
A halfway decent auction game with some really good ideas, but it just doesn't hang together well enough to justify all the things that are needed to make it worthwhile.  There are some decent variants here that make the game work well, but ultimately it is just too problematic. The secret auctions are actually pretty cute, but the penalties to win a tile that you can never use are too significant.

The most unfortunate bit is that if you have the opportunity to complete your city then you just can't win.

RATING: 2
Really just a lousy auction game.  You have little control over what to auction; there might be a decent face-up tile or there might not, and your money is dictated by the roll of a die.  You can only attack your opponents if you roll a saboteur and even then, you don't have a choice in whom to attack.  I didn't feel that there was much control in this one; if I want to play a quality auction game, I'll grab Ra or Modern Art.  Pretty and well-done components, though.

It took quite some effort to obtain this, now OOP, game, but I am afraid that it looks far more interesting than it plays. This does not mean that it is a bad game, simply that it does not raise any eyebrows (in any way). Best seen as a light auction game for non-gamers, which can be played in less than an hour with 4 players. The artwork of the game is quite charming though.

Hands down the worst euro game I have ever played. Pretty much irredeemably broken. Most of the game consists of bidding on face-down tiles whose identity is hidden from all but one player. This takes blind-bidding to a whole new level- you don't even know what it is you're bidding on. Dreadful.

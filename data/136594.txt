GAME: Dragon's Hoard
RANK: 2434
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
I first heard about this through Kickstarter but for various reasons declined to kickstart it, but kept an eye on it throughout its development and picked it up as soon as it hit retail websites. 

The artwork is fantastic, though I admit the seriousness of the knights and dragons and maidens is a bit mismatched with the silly sheep on the flip side of each card.

The gameplay is a bit flawed, as for me I think this game takes too long, even with just two players, to be a filler, which it is. The rulebook says you can only play a treasure once each turn, but we instituted house rules to speed up the game, allowing you to play the same action twice (action card or lay down a treasure) rather than only once, per the official rules. We also allow drawing a card as an action, which lets you work through the deck quicker, and first to 8 treasures in a 2 player game wins. Overall, it shortens the game length and I think it works better.

UPDATE 6-16-14: Bumped it down from a 7 to a 6.5. I still love the artwork and the two-sided card play, but it takes too long for a filler game and I feel like I have to house rule too many things to make it work better.

UPDATE 7-29-14: Bumped down further after going through my ratings. I don't see this one hitting the table much in the near future. 

UPDATE 6-17-15: Traded for Zooloretto in Dice Tower Con Math Trade.

I played this game just once, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.

Dragon's Hoard is a cute little game with an interesting mix of hand management, multi-use cards and take that mechanisms. I especially like the overall presentation of the game. The artwork is among the best I've ever seen and it really pops out thanks to the over-sized cards.

Gameplay-wise Dragon's Hoard shows a couple of interesting ideas, but the sum of its parts doesn't come out as anything particularly innovative. It does offer a bunch of interesting choices, but when I was done playing I didn't feel particularly entertained. It feels a little hard to control as you might get very good cards for one color, but not enough resources to play them. There's also a lot of luck involved in the drawing of new cards, which is only partially mitigated by action cards and the field of sheep. The "take that" elements of the game didn't bother me as much as I expected, but that also might be because I was playing a 2-player game. I wonder whether adding more players would bring to frustrating situations with lots of dumb "take that" and leader bashing that could ruin the experience.

To sum up, Dragon's Hoard is a cute card game with amazing artwork and some nice idea, but it does have unfortunately its problems. It's not a bad game by any means, but it's also - in my opinion - sadly forgettable.

The art for this one is both fun and beautiful. Very straight forward play, but a good quick filler game and apparently much faster with two players.

RATING: 6
It's got an interesting mechanism (the double-sided cards), a nice theme and fantastic art, but the game didn't click for me or my girlfriend. Player interaction is basically playing nasty cards on the others: it isn't very fun to be forced to discard a hand you've built for the last 5 turns... There's also the "wait for the right card" thing, which my girlfriend calls the "Ticket to Ride problem".

All in all, I'm still glad I kickstartered this to encourage the designer, and the product itself is nice enough, but I don't think I'll play this game again...

This card game is one of the best small box games you can buy. Plus if you know someone who likes Uno I think you'll easily be able to talk them into this game. The art is stellar and the game play is just so so easy. You can teach this one in a matter of minutes but we think you'll be enjoying it for years.

Kickstarter supporter for 2 games. Very satisfied with the delivered card game. The cards are beautiful. I realy like also the backsides with the colored sheeps.
Easy to teach and to play.
Played it with 2, 3 and 4 players. All combination are ok. But with 4 player it becomes a little bit turbulent (say less control what will happen when you have the next turn). Like the play with 3 players the best.
Gave the 2nd game to my oldest niece, and she was quit happy about this gift.

My wife and I are easing ourselves into a tolerance for "take that" mechanics and this game is perfect for that goal. Not too nasty but it has nice little jabs here and there. I'll call it our Tuesday night game: when we're still not ready for something more involved but we have enough energy for a little back and forth. The artwork is gorgeous, btw. The game feels slightly too long after our first play but I'm thinking we will probably tighten the playtime up with some experience.

Light, easy game with some mildly interesting choices, but nothing spectacular. The art is great, and it has the virtue of being teachable to non-gamers. OTOH, luck plays far too much of a role, and I couldn't imagine getting much better with multiple plays. Between equally-experienced gamers, the winner will inevitably be the one who had the best luck with the cards. Still not bad. I'd just rather play San Juan.

I just realized that I've put the lowest rating on this game so far, and it's only fair that I leave a comment explaining my feelings.

I backed Dragon's Hoard on Kickstarter largely on the strength of the artwork, but also based on my wife's love of both dragons and sheep. Also, I enjoy card games in general and I like supporting independent designers and publishers.

The art is fantastic, just as advertised. The sheep are cute. I really like the look of the game. The graphic design is good, except for the similarity of certain colors under certain lighting (blue and purple were very tough to distinguish by color alone, for instance).

The game play, though, is something that I'd just as soon never revisit. The strategy is a bit more interesting than I thought based on my read-through of the rules, but not a whole lot. The importance of lairs to put your treasures into is a nice wrinkle, and there's some good tension between saving up for big treasures and getting little treasures down quickly.

However, the level of "take that" in this game crosses solidly into the "unfun" territory for me. Discard half your hand, steal two cards, and above all skip a turn... not fun. Skip a turn mechanics are just brutal. Yes, I know that there are Battle cards to defend against these actions, but there are also Wizard cards to force them through. Turns aren't so quick that skipping one doesn't hurt; it's a major downer, and I felt bad making my opponents skip turns.

If you like a lot of "take that" in your card games, then you might enjoy Dragon's Hoard just fine. I like a little bit, but not the "skip a turn" level; it's just too much.

Great art, but unfun game play. I'm not a fan.

This game actually has cards in it that make people skip turns. How is that fun? How is that effect anything but an outdated "take-that!" in need of immediate extinction? We come to the table to play a game. Cards that eliminate my turn eliminate my very reason for sitting at the table.

Despite good reviews, the gameplay is rather simplistic. The art is great but the card quality is poor and the surface easily scuffs. I don't like using card sleeves and wish the quality was better. The set collection in this game is not complex enough to be as interesting as say, Citadels, which is what I was hoping this game would be a quicker version of minus the role selection. Too long for what it is.

Way too much screw-you in this one. You could, I suppose, use the take-that cards only for payment and not for their abilities, but you'd lose. I'll grant, though, that letting players know the suits of their opponents' cards is a nice design touch.

Plays fast and offers some tactical considerations with a low to medium amount of player interaction, which is just right for a game of this kind. The art is really something else. You won't find a better looking game for less money anywhere.

Played 1 time with 3 players.

Honestly, it was boring and felt like a huge waste of time. The actions cards were variations on mass-market style "take that" board games (Draw 2 cards, Everyone else discard half their hand, Take 2 cards from opponent) and the rest of the game was just a lucky scramble for the right colour cards to fall into your hand so you could score the large point cards.

Boring, tepid design.

Do you know what I like? I like finding new games that look great, are enjoyable and easy to learn and share. Dragon's Hoard is one of those games. few rules that are to the point. Players are dragons collecting treasure to place in their lairs. Very few words and easy mechanics make it great for the family game night. We played with 2 plays which was okay but definitely more entertaining with 3 or 4. I would suggest this game to anyone that needs a easy game that plays in a short time.

-Fun card game that forces you to choose between one face of the card (color) or the other (action, treasure)

RATING: 3
As even Action cards can be used to pay for treasures, there is barely no advantage playing them as an action (stealing or others discarding cards) over using them directly to pay for your treasures.
So you simply draw cards and then pay for cards with victory points on them. Extremly bland and no interesting gameplay (repetive and boring). Only a 4 player game may be acceptable as there is more effect on action cards. Otherway: it's a pity, such nice artwork for a boring game.

An ok mixture of Jaipur and San Juan but not as good as either and lighter than both. The uniqueness to me is that because of the art on the cards, you can see what colors your opponents have, but not what the card itself is. I've only played this game with two and I think I'm missing out. We can each go for our own colors quite peacefully. With more people I think there would be a lot more blocking, stealing, and backstabbing. However, if I'm going to bother to teach a new game to a group of friends, I probably won't waste my time with this one.

Ticket To Ride-like choosing cards by colour in order to select the right ones to discard for points, with bonuses if you have the extra cards of that colour -- all mixed in with some power cards as well just to make it unique. A combination of strategy to block your opponents mixed with luck of the deck combination. Enjoyable as an intro/finishing game but not a main game by any stretch.

PLUS: quality artwork, decent mix of strategy and luck
MINUS: blue and purple are too close in tone, cards don't fit in the box when sleeved

In Dragon's Hoard, each player plays a dragon hunting for treasure. Collect sheep from the farmer's fields and use them to buy treasures, but watch out! Other players will send angry mobs and wizards your way to stop you. Defend yourself and battle your way to riches.

In game terms, players draft cards from a common draw pile before taking their actions. You want to buy as many treasures as you can. Dragons buy treasures with sheep that they've collected, while opponents will play terrible actions against you to keep you from tendering those sheep. Battle to keep your treasure, while trying to stop your opponents from doing the same.

At the end of the game, the player with the most victory points from treasures and bonuses wins!

A fun quick game that is easy to learn and quite clever. I like the dual use of the cards, both as actions/treasures (points) and as resources. It makes for a very interesting balancing act and there are a variety of strategies to playing a seemingly simple game.

The art is also really good. Definitely one of the draws of the game.

I can play a card to rip an opponent of cards. Then he/she can play a card to stop my action. To make sure my opponent can't play such a card I can add a wizard. But then he/she can still play a unicorn.

Ok filler game, but doubt I will ever get it out again over Love Letter, Coup, Walk the Plank or many other filler games I have.

The game had little to now interaction, the action cards usually felt like you were better off using them to buy treasure than to use on your opponents and the game felt like four people playing some solitaire game with the occasional interaction.

The artwork is great.  The gameplay, not so much.  A standard take that game where you use cards to buy cards from your hands until a certain number are built and you score points for what you have on the table.  Does not do much new, except the two sided cards are kind of ok.

This is like a streamlined and more interesting version of Monopoly Millionaire card game -- and with a fantasy theme.  You collect sets of cards and cash in those sets for treasures which you hoard in your lair.  There are also some take-that cards to mix things up.  Your ability to pick cards based on their color (as in Bruges) makes this feel less random and more tactical.  Also, the artwork is amazingly beautiful.  My initial reaction to this game was very high, but with multiple plays the game has lost is allure -- I'm already a bit bored with it.

My five-year-old really got into this - she's a sucker for anything that involves collecting treasure.  I knew she was comfortable with the rules when half-way through our first game she flipped her cards up and decided she didn't want to show them to me anymore.  

I remember reading something about all the effort made to make the cards work for the color-blind.  I'm not color-blind, but think now that perhaps I am - I have a heck of a time differentiating between the blue and purple and the orange and the red cards.  Card quality is also pretty poor.  Oh well.

Kickstarted. Includes the Unicorn card which is a kickstarter exclusive.

Played 3 player games with fiancee and dad. This game offers enough tough decisions to be fun. I thought the game would be too light to my taste but it is a pretty fun and solid game.

---- Update ----
After my first 2-player game with fiancee I seriously find this game lacks tension. I feel this game plays best at 4 because those action cards will keep people on their toes but with 2 player most often the most nastiest cards (wizard and angry mob) will be used as treasure food. Rating goes from 7 -> 6.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.2
Fairly fun game. A bit too long for what you get, but I think that could be adjusted to suit your group by reducing the amount of treasures needed to trigger the end and/or by increasing the number of cards drawn.

Some slight issues with telling the colors apart. Could have been solved with a different blue on the blue cards and using green instead of orange.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Uh... Boring. Could have been more interesting if the color cards didn't require the same color of cards. Basically no surprises and maybe it took a bit too much time as well for what it was. Nice artwork though. But mostly a game for kids.

This game is a basic hand management game with very few meaningful decisions. Concentrate on few colours and don't aim for the highest costing cards and if you get lucky, and not targeted every other turn, you'll do well. Most of the time it's an exercise in frustration though and if it wasn't for the art it would finds its way quickly to our outside bin.

16-05-2014. Rated after 1 game. Fun set-collection game which features fantastic artwork and a fun idea of using double-sided cards. You try to play treasures by discarding an amount of sheep from your hand of a certain color to satisfy the costs of your treasure. 

You can choose to get new cards based on the back side of the card, which show the color of the card. You have action cards you can play or save to play treasures. So basically you have set collection and hand management and interesting decisions based on what you draw.

Fun game. I would enjoy it. I owned it very short, as I traded it for 2 b-wings.

Stunning art and beautiful looking game. Card stock quality could have been better (and no room in the box for sleeved cards). Game play is simplistic, but this looks like a good one to break out for non-gamers.

There is a bit too much of "take that" in this game.  As the game progresses, the number of treasures in the deck decrease, which means there are many more attack cards played.  This makes it feel like the last two treasure cards take as long to get as the first eight.  A game should speed up as it gets to the end, but this one feels like a drag at the end.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
I like that whole "pay for cards by discarding other cards" aspect that they used, kind of similar to Race for the Galaxy and many other games. However, the take-that elements and the randomness of the cards are real turnoffs. There are better card-based resource games, and there are better take-that games.

Sold.

Culled - First wave; Comics Place contribution

Why we culled it: This was an early KS campaign for me, and I backed it before my (since outdated) personal assessment tools were mature. I also backed it for 2x copies, one of which I gave to my sister. She plays it on occasion and has some above-lukewarm things to say about it, but it never came out to play from either of our collections when we got together. After a few years of never playing it and never really wanting to play it, I let it go. I do still like the artwork quite a bit, and I hope it finds a happy home.

Not bad but not my favourite game. 
You try to collect sets in colours. You pay the cards you add to your collection with sheep in your hand. The more expensive the cards, the more points you get if added to the collection. The game ends when a number limit is reached by a player.
I'm not so keen on set collection.

As far as quick, accessible games go, this ones isn't bad.  I was worried originally because there are some means cards in there, especially the nefarious "Skip Player".  In play though, these aren't as bad as you'd think.  Turns can go around pretty quickly and there are a lot of "Stop Action" cards to prevent things.  Generally you only see people start playing the really mean cards when someone jumps ahead.

Fantastic art and a pretty fun filler in a small package.

Wore off pretty quickly trying to teach it to new players, can feel like a slog some games, traded away.

very light card game, a small step up from Uno (a bit longer but with tactics and choices!), plays very well with 2-3p

[+] very small box, fast paced, easy to teach, scores are usually tight
[-] not that much 'take that' (even though attack cards exist, people are usually able to block them and using them for attack means not having them as resource), not good quality cards (show wear signs fast), english is not ideal with kids

I bought this because of the "One card, multiple uses"-mechanism, which I love. Saldy, this game is a little boring. We almost never used the action cards, because then you would give up a card you can use for treasures to hurt someone else - maybe. Cause I was hording dragons, and others did too. So it boiled down to setcollection and who has the luck of picking up the right cards. Meh.

Played this game last night for the first time. Fun game! The art work is fantastic. At first everyone is trying to use cards to get items but later when cards are running short the attacking starts to heat up. The nice thing is if your color blind the symbols of sheep help you see what cards you need to use. It is neat to see a game with 2 sided cards, at first you think it's weird but after playing it fits perfectly. This is a must buy for card gamers.

Filler interactive card game. We are dragons consuming adorable colored sheep, hoarding the most treasure, and upgrading our lairs while sending wizard assisted angry mobs to our neighboring player dragons. The card draft is juicy pulling from the deck or the three face down cards.  Nice art, simple fun with smack. Wish it played more than four.

A very fun game. Good mechanics, plays fairly quickly. My kids picked it up and enjoyed it. My wife, who doesn't like games she has to strategize very much for, said she likes it. (It's rare for her to like a game.) :) Really enjoy the artwork, and the mechanic of each side of the card having a dual purpose. 

One gripe (which is why it gets an 8 and not a 9) is that the blue and purple cards are way too similar in color, and led to a few mistakes during gameplay. Also, I'm not a huge fan of the action cards, because it's easy to gang up on someone - but that's just my opinion. They're easy enough to defend against, so it's fairly well-balanced.

All-in-all, it's a keeper, a great inclusion on game nights, and one I think most people would enjoy.

Enjoyable filler game. Played 2 games so far and it plays very quick. There is a small take that element to it so if that is something you don't like you better leave this game alone.
The art is amazing, very colourful and great images. Also a nice touch that each colour also has a different symbol.
There is a small amount of strategy in pick the cards you draw and play but also some luck. Makes for a very varying gameplay each time.

Big letdown.  I backed it via preorder, right after the Kickstarter ended, and it just didn't do much for me.  It can be random to a fault and some of the mechanics just aren't compelling.  I thought it would be sort of a lighter Ticket to Ride but, honestly, I'd rather just play Ticket to Ride.

Also, the card quality is ATROCIOUS.  The colors are staggeringly bad--blue and purple are damn-near indistinguishable in poor light.  The card stock is flimsy and the ink chips away VERY easily.  I had to sleeve everything before I could even play... which meant it then couldn't fit back into its tiny box... which meant I then had to find a box for it.  What a mess.

RATING: 8
This starter comes with good BAC's to add to your collection and some good "bat-family" affiliated characters. Unfortunately all of the Superman-affiliation characters are pretty lame, useless, or wayyy too expensive.

More Dice Masters, more DC, there are some neat abilities here but at the same time some character redundancy when I'd rather they delved even deeper into the source material and added a lot of more obscure names into the game. Still, you're getting some new tweaks and combos.

EXPANSION:

Awesome DC Comics based dice masters. I log my plays for DC Comics on DC Comics Juatice League Dice Masters.

RATING: 10
This is the set to get if you love the idea of playing with Batman, it's world of characters or Superman and his world of characters. There's not much else. But for me, those are the ones that I want, which is why I bought this set over Justice League, which my brother has anyway. 

I also have War of Light. And with that one, I have lantern Wonder Woman and Flash, so I'm not totally deprived of the other DC heroes that I like. 

All in all, I wanted Batman and Superman, period. And this set has them and other variations in spades.

Plays are for combined plays with all of dice master sets.

 While I have a lot of characters and a decent amount of dice. I just don't have enough dice to play with standard tournament rules. I can play with those rules, but that would limit my options to fewer characters that I own. So to get the most out of my game, I play with 5 characters, 10 dice, and 20 points. I think strategy changes depending on the amount of dice to point ratio you have. The way we have it so far seems to work like a charm. I didn't want anyone to be able to successfully nickel and dime the whole game to a victory. That kind of strategy is too much luck based, in my opinion. I wanted more margin for error and required thought for well thought out and planned attacks to get those points down. I still might go to 15 points at some point. But for now, we do the full 20 with 10 dice and 5 characters. Even with the amount that I play  with, I have had a match were 19 points were taken in one player's turn to win the game. That game was THE game of Dice Masters games that I've had. The score was 19 to 2. And the winner took away 19 points to win the game in improbable fashion. It was actually quite unbelievable!
G
Update: Decided to move to 15 points with 10 dice. It's more balanced, I think.

Update: Moving back up to 20 points. More skill is required and there are other reasons. Playing with so much fewer than 20 dice makes it really hard to purchase high cost characters. Playing with 15 points makes it nearly impossible to buy them.

We are also going to start mixing in a few tournament rule games since we both have more than enough cards and dice for that. It's just that for a game like this, I want to be able to play with every last card I own if I wanted. And I am very into thematic teams, teams that fit together strategy wise, but not so much like what is done at the tournament or hardcore level. I love theme. I like the idea of being forced to use a pain in the a$$ character who just is not all that helpful in hopes of trying to see if you can work around that weakness. I think that part of the game is awesome! That being said, we are also going to start playing tournament rules with assembling teams for maximum effectiveness, too. We have never really played like that before because we didn't have enough dice per character to assemble a full team.

A really great 2 player dice game. The best description is really more or less a cross between Quarriors and Magic the Gathering, which is a fantastic combination. It's fast and possibly the most strategic dice game I've ever played, with lots of great theme and wonderful artwork (not to mention all the gorgeous dice). The only two things to warn about I think are 1) it's collectable, which is sometimes fun but also sometimes irritating and 2) the combat rules can be confusing when first learning the game (in terms of knocked out vs used up). Otherwise it's fantastic.

I didn't know Dice Masters existed until two years after the fact, but it was apparently made for me.  Incorporating the good parts of deck building boardgames with the pre planning of deck building from CCGs and the gameplay of Magic and then blending it together with superhero and DnD themes created a Frankenstein masterpiece.  I love it and Jen loves it.  All our plays are recorded under Marvel Dice Masters: Age of Ultron because that was our first set and we play with all of the sets together.

The asymmetry and direct conflict is a welcome addition to the deck/pool building genre, but adding randomness on top of randomness is a major turnoff for me.

Third set for the DC Dice Masters, timed just in time for the release of Batman v Superman: Dawn Of Justice. The nice part is that it demonstrates WizKids has much more in these two universes to offer; the downside is the same thing. Still, for those who want the most popular characters, they are here.

PLUS: more of the key characters, duplication isn't overwhelming
MINUS: areas of DC still unexplored, more Lanterns as ultra rare

I used to not think much of this set, but then I realized how much I use cards from this set. UC Alfred is amazing and fits well with a lot of teams. A good Batman team is going to use a lot of cards from this set, and Superman: Hero of Metropolis is the best option for a Superman team w/ Jimmy Olsen: Signal watch (from Superman & Wonderwoman).

DC Comics Dice Masters: World's Finest will introduce new game mechanics: the “Allies” keyword as well as the “Iron Will” and “Vengeance” abilities. Over 30 heroes and villains make up the new card and dice for this expansion.

This is such a fun game. My daughter and I could be playing it forever. I like the simple mechanics and the theme. It's the first dice-building game we have ever played and I'm looking forward to get more games alike.

Worst Dice Masters set to Date.

Amounts to nothing more that a not-so-cheap cash-in on the equally underwhelming BM/SM movie.

No new JL/JSA dice, no new Teen Titans, NO SALE!

Full set except for 3 of the Black Lantern SRs.  This set lends itself to teams, i.e. Villains, Superman or Batman groups.  Coooool!

RATING: 8.8
A really fun bluffing game, if played with the right people it can create awesome, hilarious memories, especially when people forget what they declared or get pissed for being checked frequently :)).

IMO it is a better bluffing game than Sheriff of Nottingham as it forces you to lie and cheat in order to pass illegal goods and make money if you want to win. Sheriff Of Nottingham is more focused towards set collection and someone can easily beat you at points with that no matter how many illegal goods you smuggled. Robin Hood is also a lot more limited in resources...you can only check one person(+1 per game from the deputy and 1 for blackmailing with the crown) so you must use them wisely. In Sheriff you get to verify all the people.

If you like bluffing games and want to see how well your friends can lie or if friendships last, play this game!

Great bluffing game! Hard to find but well worth it. We laughed so much as we bluffed our way through this.

They recently have released this games as Sheriff of Nottingham. Not sure if I will buy it since I have this original one. The new version does have nicer components but in the end it's the same game.

Update: I did end up buying the new version. Just couldn't resist. And Im glad I own both now.

It's amazing how we can have so much fun fooling eachother!

I think the new version "Sheriff of Nottingham" would get a higher score on my list, it has some rules and component changes that improve the game.

I really liked this (as I thought I would). I reckon you can teach it pretty easily to non-gamers also so it would be a good addition to the collection. Reprint eagerly awaited!

I have Sheriff of Nottingham, which is a little different, but has enough similarity to not need both.

Quando jogado com 3 ou 4 pessoas é um baita jogo, com 5 acaba se tornando muito longo.
Um jogo de blefe, funciona bem com Party Game, apesar de ter certa estratégia nas decisões de quando e como blefar, mas nada cansativo. Perfeito pra ensinar para seus primos e família, muito bom com amigos também.

Best with 3 or 4 players.

What a nice party game full of laughs and bluffing. Played with nine people (some of them played in twos). The rule that says one must look in the eyes of the sheriff while declaring what is in the bag is mandatory!

"Hart an der Grenze" - Robin Hood style. My choice for a bluffing game. Good filler.

This is the precursor of "Sheriff of Nothingham". It's almost the same game.

The changes made in SoN look like downgrades to me.

Great game from Galápagos, wonderful way to fun and laugh. It shows how much Galápagos Jogos is improving in every aspect, although it's a game that have a bunch of graphic design/art major problems.

Another version of the 1950 game Contraband. Low production quality, but it's okay. Takes the whimsical border smuggling of Hart an der Grenze and gives it a spin in Sherwood Forest tying to smuggle your wares past the Sheriff of Nottingham. Lots of gambling, bluffing and guessing and not much else. It's okay, but not a game I feel the inclination to keep bringing to the table.

I didn't have high hopes for this going in, but there's a lot here to enjoy; the bluffing and lying initially, the reading of peasants as the sheriff and then the pitiful bartering to try and avoid an inspection.

It seems as though the designers have kept adding ideas to the game until they found the perfect balance of unweildyness and choice. It's a great balance they've struck and the game was a lot of fun.

Update: With 5 players it perhaps gets a little too downtimey and lasts too long. 4 is the sweet spot for me.

Bluffing and negotiation at its best. Extremely fun with the right group. Too bad they couldn't reedit it with the old theme, as the new one doesn't match the gameplay very well

RATING: 7.5
A good and interactive game of bluffing and guessing. In it you are: or the Sheriff trying to block some of the forbidden goods (jewels, cloth, and so forth) to enter the city, or the ones trying to smuggle the goods in.

Sure, you can take legal goods (fruits, chickens, potatos) but the value of them is low. And the winner is the one with the most money in the end.

As the Sheriff you can accept bribes, and as the smugglers, you can offer them. Because, for exemple, the jewels are worth, say, 10 money for the smuggler, but only 5 for the Sheriff (he get his cut, but only a cut). So one can offer 6 money to it. Will the Sheriff take it? He might get more this way, but what if the smuggler ins't just carrying one jewel card, but two? Or jewels and booze?

Anyway, the game is this back and forth, bribes and taxes, lies and guesses. It is fun, but it has its problems:

a) Always play with 4 or 5. Five is better. With more people there is less chance of one always being pick by the Sheriff of the turn;

b) You can be always picked by the Sheriff. Maybe the player is angry with you, maybe you are always to greedy, or you lie/bluff to poorly. Anyway, the game allows this, but a group of friends (or family) should try to avoid this.

All in all, a solid game.

I got this one for something totally different, I hadnt really gotten into miniatures because they were expensive.... And for a time it was...One of the shortcomings of this game was what many GW games suffer from, a new model come out and then suddenly the balance of the game is shifted...This one suffered a bit less from this than say, Warhammer 40K...but it still undercut was was actually a nice game.

Epic 40K is still the best sci-fi battle game that GW has ever produced. LOTS and LOTS of units make that the dice-rolling mechanics of the game are still very tactical. Units move fast over an enormous field, and this makes for a very tactical game, contary to GW's other static, slow and cumbersome battle games.

The game that started it all for me and Epic.  Well I guess Adeptus Titanicus did that, but this was what started the addiction to 6mm infantry!  Good game, lots of rules, lots of add-on rules that made it kludgy and bogged down, the next version cleaned it up, but was still problematic, then the next edition screwed it up again, then the most recent edition seems to have finally got it right.  Whi knows though, I have not yet played the new edition.

Owned this at one time.  Tons of tiny bits.  Fiddley, silly rules. TONS of dice rolling like every GW mini game.  Want a good game?  Take the minis and play "Dirtside" from Ground Zero Games.  Sold it off for a ton of money after it went OOP.

Played first edition in high school, second edition in college. Currently own 1st edition. Vastly prefer the second: the first edition is too detail-oriented for a game of this scale. But either edition will get you a ton of plastic tanks and infantry, good for use with these or other 6mm rules.

This game, for me, was the beginning of a long slide into the Greed Workshop vortex. At the time, we had a lot of fun games of this (combined with Adeptus Titanicus). Now of course, it's been endlessly worked over and re-issued as Epic 40K.

This at one time was my favorite GW game. I had so much Epic minitures, it wasn't funny. I would go hungry during college to buy more! They dropped the system, and I haven't really bothered with GW until their new Lord of the Rings game.

This is one of GW's most under-rated games by afficionados of the GW hobby.  The simplicity of the rules in comparison to the likes of Warhammer combined with the large-scale planning that needs to go on in order to win make Space marine a winner in my mind.  Shooting and close combat are all resolved with a simple single dice roll, then psychological effects are all merged into an equally simple dice roll.  This was the only GW table top game that one could legitimatly buy lots of miniatures for without going into debt.  Such a shame they scrapped it in favour of 'Epic 40,000'.

I love this game, and consider it close to the pinnacle of GW games. It's chaotic and fiddly, but somehow all the silliness and crunchiness comes together into a package I find irresistable. It's a wonderful tactical game, and I love squad level combat. I think that if someone took the time to migrate this to a d10, the game has the potential to be a masterpiece. Of course, YMMV.

This is an old edition by now...probably with a VERY small player base. When I played it, I was expecting more of a grand feel to the battles of WH40k, but this just didn't seem to follow through with it's promise. Warmaster handled it better I would say.

From a hobby standpoint, these models were just WAYYYYY too small to paint.

I really wish BGG would split entries for the two versions of Space Marine. While similar, they are also very different games and aren't interchangable. 

I started out playing the first version of Space Marine with its sister game, Adeptus Titanicus, along with the Codex Titanicus and all of the additional rules published in White Dwarf. It literally was the game I had waited my whole life for and didn't know it.

After Adeptus Titanicus was released, rules for infantry and armored vehicles kind of evolved through articles published in White Dwarf. But even after the release of the first edition, the rules continued to be tinkered with, such as introducing the optional 'Epic Battle System' in Codex Titanicus, and slight revisions of previously released rules, or simply new ones published in White Dwarf. To be honest it was rather a mess trying to keep up with it all, and by the time Games Workshop released the second edition, which meant killing the support for the first edition, they hadn't published the third part of their Chaos rules, nor their long awaited rules for Eldar Aspect Warriors. Which was iroinic, as they we already selling the models for them.

The second edition really strips out a lot of the details that slows the first edition down so much, and makes it more of a colorful game to play for the average gamer. Its easy to see why this version was the most popular of any edition of Epic.

That being said though, while I would pull the second version off the shelf to play with someone, especially one who was new too Epic or gaming in general, my heart is still with the original system. I everything ever released for it, and most of all, love the time period it is set in, the Horus Heresy. Just flipping through the Space Marine v1 rulebook gives me goosebumps. Very little in the 40k universe captures my imagination like the Horus Heresy.

Update: Been playing 2nd Edition again with players new to the game and its been a lot of fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
A true classic, with or without Titan legions. Of all the game systems I've tried since I first began with minis 1991 this needs the least amont of tweaking with house rules, etc.

The rules are rather simple but at the same time elegant, meaning it will fitt both first timers and longbeards.

Scale "6mm" is perfect for a normal 120 x 180 cm board. Ranges are in cm. Smart and easy army building with the armycards, no hours of endless fiddling deciding if you want one or more minis in a unit or stuff the hero with one more manly useless item like (40k and WHFB).

This would be the last game, of the hundreds in my collection, I would part with... this and Mutant RPG from the eighties. Need I say moore... ; ) 

It might be hard to come by the rules and expansions but Net Epic gives you most of the original game.

While Epic: Armageddon might be a nice game on it's own it's not to be confused with the original as it's a completely different rules set, far from Epic.

Sequence of play and vehicle rules are great, infantry rules are overly fiddly as you get more units on the table. Check out NetEpic instead for all that 6mm fun!

Spent far more time collecting it rather than playing it. But I preferred it far more than that the flagship GW games (Fantasy Battles and 40K). Have recently reacquired a couple of armies, but have decided to use the Epic 40,000 rule-set. I've seen the argument that this is a "dumbed down" version, but I see it as more of a distilled version, focused more on strategy and less on millions of different special rules for every single different unit in the game (something that appealed to the adolescent version of me, but has become a bit burdensome as I age).

8.5: (2nd Edition) I haven't played in years, but back in the days this was my favourite game. It really nicely captures the feeling of large scale battles where you give your troops orders and see them get executed in action. I love the way the battlefield is large enough to contain multiple different areas of conflict between different types of units, but you're still able to move the fastest moving units from one area to another if their help is badly needed. I remember playing was really fun and the game had a great feeling and atmosphere to it.

I have fond memories of this one. I used to build up alot of terrain from pretty weird stuff (at the time, it was pretty difficult to buy the ready-made pieces of terrain that are now very commonly available). I dried up moss and applied a bit of hairspray and colored them, then stuck them on metal tree branches. I spray painted styrox which sort of melted away under the spray and was good for doing pieces of rock structures. I bought meters of green blankets (for lack of a better word) which I used to create all sorts of terrain pieces and of course use as a general playing cloth in the table.

All the games we played were excellent and I have very good memories of them. As with all GW games, your enjoyment is measured by how much money you put into this hobby.

I loved this back in the day. It was, of course, excessively figure-based, and the variety of units made for a lot of data to memorise, yet it could play pretty quickly, play was pretty involving, and by not having a board with "squares", it somehow seemed more natural.

Back home soon learned you must buy more to enjoy this and simply wasn't willing to invest in it.

Still no excuse for not even trying.

I bought quite many expansions for this one and I also played it (and liked it) quite alot when I was younger (we played it in my parents' garage on a self made ping pong table. We used video casettes as hills, Lego(TM) trees as forests and plenty of Lego constructions for larger vehicles and other stuff that we didn't have miniatures for... there definitely was a certain feel to that). It's quite long and there's alot of rules to remember when you play it. To even get to the "ok" or "good" state you have to spend alot of time and money on this game (especially now when it's OOP)... like most Games Workshop titles it's more a hobby than a game IMO.

Oh man was I into this game! I had several 5-6,000 point armies completely painted, terrain, the works. Yeah there were some problems in the rules but nothing a good house rule couldn't fix. One of GW's better designs, IMO. Still play it from time to time and it's still a lot of fun. Great theme, great minis.

RATING: 5
A very fun game, but it only gets a 5 due to being rife with overcomplexity and balance problems.  Epic 40K simplified and improved the game, but oversimplified it a bit.  I will always have a soft spot for this game though - I met my girlfriend and love of my life at a game of it (we teamed up so we could both play Eldar)!

Painted:
Large marine force
Large Eldar force
Several Ork, Tyrannid and Chaos models; most of those forces unpainted.

When combined with Adeptus Titanicus, this game goes up to like a 8.5 to 9 points.  On it's own... meh.  Really only great for supporting it's giant, building stomping brother.

I had a very dear friend in school called Fuzz (not his real name, but what everyone knew him as on account of his hair) who I used to play this, WH and WH40K with most weekends/most days in school holidays throughtout my teens.  Unfortunately Fuzz committed suicide after his first year at Uni and I’ve not played any of these titles since.  Recently when I was home I drove past his family’s old house on the way to visit my sister and it made me realise that I still miss him after 17 years.

Had it once, got all zillion mini-miniatures and microtanks safe and sound from their frames, but never played it since I didn't have a table with the size this game demands. In late 90s a friend borrowed it, and I forgot about it. He now lives in the south of Spain... 
To be honest, I don't care about the loss. It was until the Space Hulk hype until I thought of it again but I feel no need at all to play this, ever.

Given by friend.  Never played.  Heck, I'd have to reorganize all the pieces first since they're scattered throughout several different boxes.

Someday.  

In the meantime, I'm not counting it as part of my collection until I finally straighten out all the pieces and parts situation.

300 Epic-Scale Marines just waiting to be kitbashed into a game...when I find one to suit.

Space Marine is a light minis game roughly on a scale similar to Micro Armor. In many ways I like it better than W40K.

A great set of rules for a fun 'epic scale' Science Fantasy conflict.

The first wargame i really got into, painted up lots of models for it and played for a good few years.  Now over 20 years old, it still holds up well.

Great game - the Eastern front in a microcosm. It's a big game; lots of counters, lots of decisions and lots of die-rolling! One Spanish Infantry Division (250th, Blue) takes on three Russian Infantry Divisions over two days.

This is my favoorite TCS game that I own. I love setting up all those Russian Infantry units and then watching the tide flow across toward the Spanish defensive positions.

Preferred the counter and map graphics of the initial game series. The new picto-graphics and oversaturated colors on the maps almost remind me of a cartoon. And, not in a good way. In addition to needing several house rules.

One point higher due to the subject matter alone.

Yet to play.  A somewhat obscure but fascinating battle using the TCS.  Excellent background on battle and the Spanish Blue Division ... it's worth looking up more about this unit via Google.

A monster tactical wargame.  I got it set up once and got through about half a game playing it solo.  Took me months.  I don't think I could get away with ever giving it another try now that I'm married.

Recently picked this one up...very, very nice components.  I'm not familiar enough with TCS to comment, but it looks playbable.  The command rules are not absolutely required - w/o those the TCS games are simplified somewhat.

     Great Tactical game of the destrution of the Spanish Facist Blue Division.  Though "wordy" the system flows quite well  once you get used to it.

Looong... but, has to be seen to be believed.  No game brings the reality of a Russian human wave assault home in a more brutal fashion.   TCS command system excellent as always.

This was a game published when The Gamers were playing with computer graphics and the map shows that they had not yet perfected their technique. The components are okay but the map is not. In terms of game play, it goes like this. The Russians amass a whole load of off-board artillery and pound the bloody hell out of the Spanish Division who are well-entrenched. Then, the real carnage ensues because now three Russians divisions have to traverse over a huge field to get to the Spanish defenders. There is a real desperation playing the Russians as you run them through this big field with bullets playing everywhere. For the Spanish player, there is desperation as well since you can only kill so many Russians per turn. This is the Russian 'human wave" attack, taken to an extreme degree.

The real problem with the game comes down to the artillery rolls for the Russians at the beginning of the game. Roll well? you stand a good chance of winning. Roll badly? Well, you'd might as well lead from the front since you don't want to be the one explaining how three Russian divisions got shot up to Stalin. Worth playing once but that is about it.

A real Russian hordes battle. TCS command system just shines in this one. The Russians will win but this one is about playing the game as an experience. Play this if you want to see what the "real" Russian front was with cardboard instead on real people. I like it.

This was my first TCS series game, but I'm not really that crazy about the rules.  More complicated than I prefer.  Too much flipping of rules and charts.  Slowed game down.  Rating reflects how well I liked the game, others may like it a lot more.

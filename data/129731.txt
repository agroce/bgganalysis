Pros:
Essentially Speedball the board game (you can even get a Speedball MVP). Fairly straight forward rules. Quick compared to Blood Bowl. The miniatures look great.

Cons:
I think the card play and fan factor are unnecessary. The miniatures are a pain to put together (although this is addressed in the 2.0 edition). For some factions, it is difficult to distinguish which models are blockers, jacks or strikers. Chrome rules, like cheer leaders and coaches (in Season 2?) are unnecessary and don't really add much to the game.

The basic game is simple with little in the way of strategy, but neither does it have the random and amusing events of Blood Bowl. Heavily reliant on the dice, but quite amusing nonetheless.

RATING: 6
I'm going to actually say this without feeling dirty: nine out of ten times, Dreadball gives me a better gaming experience at the table than Blood Bowl. It's quicker to play and the combative dice rolling mechanic with exploding sixes is better. It probably helps that I love ice hockey and this game feels more similar to that in terms of mechanics than american football.

However, poor skill choices hurt league play as well as wonky money/player death mechanics. Also suffers from an atrocious rulebook that makes picking up the game far more difficult than it should be.

Without question, some of the races are very weak in comparison to others.

RATING: 8
Lots of fun to play.

Have played a couple dozen times.  Very enjoyable.

A lot of people wonder how this game compares to Bloodbowl.  This game plays a *lot* faster than bloodbowl.  Very dynamic game but not in a way that creates unmanageable chaos.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 1
I had high hopes for this as a fan of Blood Bowl. However my first game (and last game) I was forced into a fumble every round until I lost due to no fault of my own. It has no tactical depth and it also suffers the same problems as other Mantic games, terrible quality miniatures and a poor theme.

A really good game in it's infancy (a few kinks to iron out, but all new games have a few of them!)I for one am really really looking forward to seeing this game expand through 2013 and seeing the community expand through it.  The game flows quite well and plays like a real fast paced sport.  Like playing ice hockey!

Many people will compare it to Blood Bowl, but that's a mistake.  Both are Blood Sports, thats true, but BB and DB have as much in common as NFL and NHL.

Very clean, intuitive, and streamlined rules make for a fun experience.  Unfortunately, after many games played we have found the depth to be lacking.  Team development choices are minimal at best, and in-game decision making lacks punch because players are so capable that defensive play is largely irrelevant and mistakes are easily recovered from.

A fun futuristic sport game. Very fast and fluid. My dice hate me in this game, though, especially my Strikers.

The game does feel a little weird. I think it's the turn sequence: you get to take five actions per turn, plus whatever free actions you manage to acquire. This is enough to set up and run a play, but not always enough to do everything you want. I suppose that makes it a nice middle ground, but it still doesn't quite mesh for me.

Dreadball captures the sports feel very well while maintaining a cool scifi/fantasy feel as well. The gameplay is pretty straightforward, but I have to refer to the rulebook an awful lot. I am super interested in checking out league play (but I doubt I'll get the chance in the town I currently live in)

RATING: 7
I like this game, but I recognize it had a lot of flaws to get over.  The rulebook is a mess (and a bit douchey in parts).  The miniatures are of average sculpting by war gaming standards and needed a lot of flash clean up.  The pitch (or more accurately court as it has walls around it) has hexes that are only the size of the model bases. Many of the model bases extend far over that or when knocked down.  The rules themselves have a bunch of rough patches to them. Especially when you consider this is designed for tournament or league play which will have arguments over the rules.  The cardboard token are serviceable, but when you consider this board game that didn't really need the attractive looking minis, it is odd to cheap out on the tokens.

However, with all of those flaws; the game is a blast to play.  It is fast, has many difficult choices for the player to make each turn concerning model positioning/facing as well as resource management with the number of actions the team gets per turn and even the number each model can have as well.  Add in a bunch of new teams all with their own strengths and weaknesses and you and your gaming group can have all kinds of fun.

Gioco che personalmente preferisco a Bloodbowl, per la sua durata più contenuta e la gestione delle ferite che in questo titolo non porta all'eliminazione dei giocatori durante la partita. A livello di regole molto simile al Bloodbowl, ma a differenza di quest'ultimo si rivela un gioco più semlpice, più veloce e a parer mio più divertente ed economico, per gli amanti di questo genere di giochi american sportivi lo trovo un buon acquisto.

I have played a few games with the core rules given out and it is pretty exciting. Once you get a game under your belt you can start to strategize and really do some cool things. Great game so far and I can't wait for the full version!

Edit: It is a good game, but it just hasn't hit the table after a few more plays. Some of the other players I have played with thought it went a bit long and frustrated them with the randomness. I think it is pretty light and fun if you play it loose and quickly.

Sci-fi miniatures [u]sport[/u] game. A streamlined version of [i]BloodBowl[/i] with a very dynamic gameplay and high replayability. Very tactical game which does reward good players. Each team plays different. Playing with Marauders is harder than playing with Corporation but all four teams listed in the game are well balanced. Playing Veer-Myn or dwarfs with the base-game is possible, using Orx or Humans miniatures instead. Tons of advanced actions, optional League rules and cards can add flavor to the gameplay.
On the "dark side" a lot of dice rolling, high luck factor and it doesn't favor defensive playing style. [i]BloodBowl[/i] is a better game.
Very nice miniatures (I painted all). I own the [i]Deluxe Edition[/i] with a promotional metal [i]Wildcard MVP[/i] miniature included.

This is nice and quick. 
Plays only end if you fumble with the ball and this is definitely an improvement on blood bowl in which any fail could cost you serious momentum.

The simple 3 dice unless you are trained (+1 die) or have acted (-1 die) system is easy to get to grips with and the teams seem fairly well balanced. I just with the Veer-myn *cough Skaven cough* could actually throw and catch the ball.

RATING: 6.5
Awesome game, fast paced, full of action, intense. Mechanics and theme combine very well. There's A LOT of dice rolling, but there's plenty of interesting decisions as well. 

-------------------------------------------------------
UPDATE: I'm beginning to grow wary/irritated with this game. This is not a well produced game. The spaces on the board are much too small for the figures, which creates messy situations all the time. The rulebook is poorly written, unclear and hard to use. The teams seem unbalanced. I don't get the impression of owning a team of unique players. The rules for exhibition matches, which allow coaches to add some character to individual players are convoluted and discouraging. The new Dreadball Ulitmate with its multi-team arena seems gimmicky. I would much rather some more, THOROUGHLY playtested teams.
I don't think that the current set of players/team stats allow for much easy variation without losing balance. 
Forge Fathers seem to be clearly worse than other teams. The Judwan and the vermyn seem too similar (both have similar feel and play fast) with the Judwan still being overpowered and boring to play (even with the stat change).
I'm considering selling this game, which would be a shame, cause I really have a need for a sports game of this ilk. Rating going down.
-------------------------------------------------------
I think that some of the problems with Dreadball arise from the fact that the company that produces it comes from a miniature gaming background. I wish Fantasy Flight Games would come up with a fantasy/sci-fi sports boardgame with a well produced rulebook, components, better expansion format and no assemblage of figures nonsense. 
-------------------------------------------------------
I hate the fact that the rulebooks aren't available on-line. Hard to get to the rule fixes. Right now, I'm hesitating about selling this game. I'm hoping for some bigger rules changes. I would immediately drop Dreadball if a company like FFG would came up with a quality product in this genre.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (April 2014)

I was hesitant to play Dreadball. Generally I dislike sport games, but the game surprised me in a good way. The Sci-Fi theme (and violence) won me over and I enjoyed a lot the game, besides I love Tactical Miniature Games. Dreadball is a fast paced, full of drama sports game. The playtime can be long, but you are so engaged in the game, that you barely noticed it. 

The game is gorgeous, the miniatures are very detailed and the gameplay is interesting (you have to decide how to spend your limited actions, what mini to use, where to send it, and where to face when it ends moving). 

The rules were explained to me, but I feel they aren’t easy to learn from the game manual. I could be mistaken about this. I think I can explain the rules under 25 minutes now. They are easy to grasp, but there are a lot of rules. There is a lot of chaos and luck on the game, but as I feel the better player will win most of the time, the luck factor doesn’t bother me as much. Also a violent sport game has to have lots of chaos so the luck is very thematic. 

Love that each team has different stats. So far I feel the Humans are much more weaker than the Greenmoon Smackers (the only teams I have played). Being able to attack (with the orcs) or dodge (with the goblins) with a 3 result on the die is very powerful, I hope the teams are not very unbalanced. 
Also love that you can play in a league in which the players gain experience and the fouls have consequences over many matches, not just in the one they were made. What I love the most is the ability to “cheat” allowed by the rules. As long as your opponent doesn’t notice, you can have more players than the norm, make fouls and other below-the-belt moves. Sometimes there are consequences, other times there are not (even in the foul was noticed). This is very novel for me, I haven’t found anything like it in other games and I really liked it.

Bottom line, Dreadball is a game I want to play again soon. It has the potential to go up in my personal ratings and I want to play a league. I haven’t played Blood Bowl so I can’t compare them yet.

It’s been a long time since I last played Dreadball, and my desire to do so in diminishing over time. In general I’m not a fan of sports and I only play this because it is a violent representation of a sport :D. I still will play if requested, but I’m decreasing Dreadball´s rating so my current feelings for the game match BGG´s recommended rating system.

Dreadball is no longer among my favorite games of 2012.

From a Bloodbowl player's perspective: I enjoyed the game.

It definitely borrowed a lot from BB, but the one thing I must commend the designers on is their new dice system. Its so easy to count now. No need to reverse a 7 and work out all the tackle zones and effects. This system is cleaner and you can use physical dice to help with the count. The game itself is fast and can definitely play in under an hour. 

The biggest con for me, if you are comparing to Bloodbowl, is that you don't have the same strategic depth. The level of planning here is minimal because you can recover from mistakes so easily. BB punishes you more and therefore players have to be very careful about their moves.

Components are okay. I have no complaints. The minis do their job fine.

Man, I cannot believe how much I love this game.  When I saw the initial Kickstarter, I passed up on the opportunity and now I really regret it.  I ended up going in with a buddy to pick up a few things to get us started with two teams a each, but that has now grown to 8 teams total.  We play in four team league right now and want to get more people involved at some point.

I always liked the concept of Blood Bowl, but found the implementation lacking.  Dreadball takes this to a new level and provides so many options for how you play your team.  I'm partial to my Z'zor team, but now I'm looking at the Judwan as another option.  

Each and every turn there are so many things you want to do, but only limited actions to do so.  I love the fact that with the "exploding sixes" even a player who has very little chance to do something can defy the odds and make a spectacular play.  The Greenskin team might be the most "bashy" of all the teams that we use, but don't underestimate a determined Human team.  

Oh and those teleporting turtles are a pain in the ass....

This is a very different beast compared to Blood Bowl.  

Unfortunately, my first play left me kind of underwhelmed / disappointed.  But let me preface this that I have been playing BB since 2nd edtition early 1990's. And I have been the commissioner for two very active and enjoyable leagues.

Caging the ball doesn't work well because facing plays a critical role in every action.  The game has a very different flow.  I think my biggest gripe is that one player can be activated up to three times (twice with actions and once with a special play card).  This just seems wrong to me. A super buffed character or three on a team would likely unbalance things.

I bought into the kickstarter with a friend.  And Mantic decided to just throw everything on a sprue into a box... so sorting through what is what was a terrible pain in the ass.

The board is way too small for the pieces (and these turned out to be way smaller than I envisioned)... Heroscape tiles would work perfect here.

Not sure if I will get a chance to give this another shot.  I do repsect Jake Thornton (I used to love his WFB battle reports and articles in White Dwarf) and wish him and Mantic every success.

RATING: 9
This game WILL be compared to BB forever. 
On the plus side, all of the teams are plastic, the rules in the box are current, and the price point is good. The rules are more intuitive than I would have expected and fairly clear. After one (quick) read through, I played a couple of rushes with my 11 year old. We both understood what was going on and look forward to playing more this weekend.

On the negative side, the figs didn't come with instructions or diagrams and several Veer-men players won't stand up without the hex bases. Almost half of the MVPs also have balance issues. The rulebook has some layout issues (at least to me) mainly in the league area. You have to hunt for the starting credit amount and then flip to the teams to see that they all start the same (by race) rather than give you freedom to build as you wish.  Hopefully this will be amended in season 2.

This has to be compared to Blood Bowl, apparently. The speed of game is definitely better, but yet tecniques to win are different. Brute force isn't as good as in BB, which is a very big pro! Basic teams are a bit dull but second and third seasons' teams look really unique and probably add more variability. Definitely a good game!

Wow, when they said figurines to assemble I had no idea they were so small and that half of them did not hold together.... I'll have to spend an hour gluing everything together and i haven't yet dared open the 3 extra teams I bought. 
Such a disappointing barrier to get into this game. I don't even see the advantage of the pieces...

The one good point is that the team packs have the stats and their special rules in the box (except one... pre-opened??), which lessens the need to track down the season rule-books (can't find them in my country anymore).

I'll revise my grade if I ever end up setting it up and playing it... but the barrier is big.

The idea of a version of American Football full of fantastical teams, magic, explosive technology, or frankly just not as dull as ditch water has always appealed to board gamers.
In DreadBall each player controls a team of six players trying to score points by throwing or running with a ball. Players take actions with their players in alternating turns (called rushes) until one team has a seven point lead. The effects of actions are resolved by rolling dice.
DreadBall is fun, frenetic, and though more complex than I would like a lot more fun than the game it is clearly copying (the 1980s Bloodbowl).

There's a lot to like about this game, and it's one that I have played quite a bit and definitely enjoy. That having been said, I have a few problems with it so far: 1) The mold lines on the miniatures are TERRIBLE 2) Each new "season" appears to introduce some substantial power creep  3) The game appears to depend far too much on luck (which maybe I only say because I lose basically every game that I play...but still) and 4) While the rules seem intuitive (and kind of are) I still find myself referencing the rule book too often.

Never played Bloodbowl, but was looking for a light "strategy wargame" when I ran across the Kickstater.  Game play is quick once you know the rules.  Rules are simple, but can be hard to find, as some nuances are buried in other rules.  The Mantic forums and Living FAQ have been helpful, as have been the BGG resources.  This is the only unanimously loved game for 7 college friends on our semiannual gatherings.  Burlington, Vermont players wanted.

I've tried a couple of games as the Orx team. I'm pleasantly surprised that tactically this game is very different than Bloodbowl. My initial response is that the game is closer to basketball or hockey than any football/rugby game. I like it.

Gameplay is rather simple, teams feel distinct. There is some tactical play involved and tactics have to be built around a teams special abilities (strengths and weaknesses.) Very nice. However, the game is rather fiddly (which is even more so because a lot of the more dramatic /big minis take too much space and get in the way) plus I do not really see why this needs to be a minis game - but then I am not a fan of minis sports games anyway, so I might be biased.
Playing time is refreshingly short. But there is a learning curve to master and some numbercrunching for optimal moves, which distracts from what could be a more light-hearted game experience.

FANTASTIC Futuristic Sports Game in the Blood Bowl vein! BUT in my opinion DreadBall flows better, moves faster, is more dynamic and streamlined!!

The ONLY negative thing I have to say is about the counters... WTF!! There is NO excuse for making so crappy thin and cheap counters! NONE!! Fix it! I know you can get some seperately but come on... Don't ever sucker punch your games like that again Mantic! FOUL!!

Pledged for this on KickStarter, Aug. 24, 2012. After 2 games played, rules are easy to pick up, especially with a QRS at hand; game plays smoothly and turns ("rushes") go by quickly. One player death in the two games, several injuries.
Have rating at 8 after four games now.
Upgrade to 8.5 after starting a 6-team mini-season. League rules need some work, but gameplay itself is excellent

Very interesting sports game. Lots of options for combo-play. The races (sans the dwarves, they are quite uninteresting even though the models might be the best sports models I've ever seen) are really interesting.
The splitting of player roles into Guard, jack and strikers and allowing them access to different parts of the available in-game actions is a really neat design choice.

It's NOT blood bowl. The two games don't compare at all. They are sports games, but that is it. 

The rules and modifiers make sense and very few games in, you stop looking at the rulebook all the time. In years of playing Blood Bowl I never really learned what went where...

I've had my eye on this game, but ended up passing up the kickstarter.  I recently decided to get into it and didn't realize what I was really getting into! :o  I purchased a Season 1 Kickstarter package from someone who had never opened theirs.  It came with a bunch of teams (I think 8) and a bunch of MVPs.

There are SOOOO many pieces to this game and it's a pain to put them together...glue, paint.  Bahh...I would have paid more for assembled and painted teams.  I still have some teams to put together and only started painting the Trontek Human team.

Game looks incredibly FUN!!!  But, it's taken me forever to assemble...and now I want to paint the F'ing things to enjoy the game even more.  But, my paint skills suck :\

Anyway, I just bought the S2 rulebook to have a little more info on leagues, which is a potential goal for me to get into.  We'll see how this goes...

I would not have thought I would say this, but DB eclipses Bloodbowl. That said it is also a clone of sorts. Had BB not existed I doubt DB would have been created, Huge chunks of DB use BB as a foundation. But by building on that already existing foundation DB takes another step. Moves and actions are more fluid. Facing of minis matters adding depth. Five actions per turn mean decisions and that means more tactics. The scoring options means comebacks are always possible. The rule of 'six' adds to the game in that it allows some huge effects if you can keep the sixes coming.

Really solid party game that is easy to get non-gamers to enjoy. Plays up to 12 people?!! Fantastic!

Played the game with an 8 year old, he has played games in the last couple of years but not with regularity. He was able to hold his attention well for the first 3 rounds but after that he became too fidgety. In the future, keep the game to only 3 rounds and it should be perfect. However, it was difficult for him to create interesting stories, he often defaulted to just ordering the tiles and reading them off. This made his 'stories' very difficult to remember.

I believe that for a gamer-child, the game could be scaled to have fewer rounds but I think a child of age 6 should be able to play and enjoy the game.

I am interested in bringing this game to work and playing with non-gamer coworkers.

Best story telling game, as it is simple enough for anyone, and you are not judged on the *quality* of your story so much as the *memorability* of it.  You can be as brief or as in-depth as you like, so anyone can do it.  Superb game!

Although games with a memory component are generally not for me, I liked this one quite a bit. 
Remembering abstract words with the help of original stories was more fun than I had expected, although I did not do exceptionally well.
However, the games very much depends on the quality of the stories told. I you simply chain the given elements without some memorable details, the job for the other players becomes much harder, and the hilarity and fun at the table gets less. Taking this into account, I think the incentive for telling a memorable story is not big enough.
Overall, I think in many groups it can be hit or miss like Dixit, at least in our case).

I found a game I really suck in but I still enjoyed playing it. Stories are hilarious and even though it was virtually impossible for me to remember the stories I liked the game. This would be fun in a party after a couple of drinks but works as well with families and such.

I loved this game, even though I don't generally like games with a memory element.  But I think the memory element was done perfectly here, in that each thing to remember by definition had a story element linked to it.  Further, it's got content creation!  So few games use this, because people find it hard.  In this game it's literally so simple a young child could do it, so even that is done well.  Awesome!

Not much fun with people who rely on memory alone and tell no real stories. Also, the scoring mechanism is unfair - as well as unnecessary. - Rating may change, depending on what players I can find for this.

RATING: 7
Making up the stories is often very very funny. But remembering the words isn't that hard, maybe we need to think up a way to make it harder... because I think it's also part of the fun when you can't remember the right word, but untill now that almost never happened.

RATING: 8
Excellent game about associatively memorizing symbols by telling short stories.  Although my gaming group is pretty left-brained (i.e. usually doesn't like games with a creative touch) this one was a huge hit.  It's just fantastic to see how much one can memorize as soon as the things to remember are brought in a proper context.  Highly recommended!

I enjoy trying the SdJ nominees when I can, so I tracked down a couple.  I can see myself playing this from time to time, it's not like I'll 'refuse' to play this game.  It's not really my cup of tea and found it a bit frustrating at times, just when I thought I would 'catch' up, I ended up being forced to continue and lost all traction.  But, little did I know that I'd catch up when everyone else lost all their tiles too.

What a wonderful game. I use it in the classroom, but I love to play it myself. With the right crowd, this is one of the best party games around (especially in the second edition). Creative, funny, sometimes difficult. Great!

Eselsbrücke is very nice story-telling game. Players have to make stories with randomly choosen picture tiles. The other players need to memorize the full story made by the story teller. The game is full of fun. However, the game takes a bit long time, 30 minutes for participation of each player.

I used to think that Stefan Dorra's name on the box was a slam dunk, but it's been a while since I've played a game of his that I've wholeheartedly enjoyed.

Eselsbrücke probably won't be a 9 for most people but the amount of laughs I've had while playing this game makes the game a true classic. With people that get into the game, it's a hilarious experience unlike most other games out there.

It's definitely not perfect - at least when I've played, it's probably a little too easy. There should probably be an easy fix to ramp up the difficulty just a little bit. The other problem is related, it seems that one mistake will knock you out of contention.

This game is similar in my mind to Time's Up. There aren't too many other games where you can remember phrases or words months later.

I've not played nor even seen this game in person, by my goodness do I like the concept. Stefan Dorra is one of my favorite designers. He designs games with very simple rules around unusual and original concepts. He has this way of finding a unique concept and vividly showcasing it in a game without burying it in rules. He deserves way more recognition than he gets. If Knizia is Bach (with his repeating themes and almost programmatic approach to game design), Dorra is Beethoven: the opposite of programmatic, but simple and powerful and utterly coherent. 

This looks to be yet another fine example of his M.O.

This Spiel Des Jahres nominated party/memory game requires mild translation of the included tiles (there's a list available on the site), but otherwise it's playable and very enjoyable for English speakers. Each player gets a pile of tiles, with the hopes of making other players remember the set. To do this, players concoct a silly story involving those tiles. After several rounds, players are tasked with remembering those tiles in the pile. Hilarity ensues. Even for those who don't like memory games, this is fun as a social lubricant. 

Very slightly overlong with 6 players... I'd recommend capping it at 4 or 5.

規則:
*每人拿一塊圖版選擇要玩的難度翻到對應面，中間也方對應的思考泡泡版塊
*每人在抽一個版塊翻到背面放在前面當作分數堆，停止版塊一旁備用
*決定起始玩家後將木驢標記放在思考泡泡一的位置
*每回合(1~4)輪流照思考泡泡顯示抽對應數量的板塊並說故事連起來，說完放在自己圖版對應回合的位置蓋著
*每回合(3~6有說故事的話在說完之後)輪流分法對應顏色的版塊來猜
1.先蓋著順時鐘往下發給每人一張，有剩的當回合玩家拿著
2.順時鐘開始猜，不能猜手中這塊，15秒內作答
3.猜中拿該版塊的玩家將該版塊給予他開著放在前面，回合結束全部蓋著疊在得分堆上
4.猜錯的就出局了不能再猜，猜對過的輪到還可以在猜，猜錯要移掉目前對應數量的版塊，優先移這回合得到的
5.如果都沒有人猜錯，則說故事玩家拿一片停止版塊放在得分堆上，扣分扣到停止版塊就不會在扣
*特殊狀況1 如果有玩家沒有分到板塊，且前面的都猜錯，則把第一個猜錯的人手上版塊拿過來
*特殊狀況2 如果輪到玩家手上的板塊是維一沒被猜到的，直接獲得

"驢橋"，雖然8歲以上就可服用看似小孩遊戲，但是考記憶這種機制很爆腦~每次都要抽特定數量版塊起來說長長的句子，讓其他玩家記住版塊的內容，第三回合開始，大家已經聽完十幾個無厘頭句子後開始猜猜樂，猜錯有獎，猜錯扣分......不猜都不行，所以每個人都要聚精會神注意場上動態，說故事的人順利讓其他人不出錯答對的話可獲得救命驢一隻XD。目前是我喜歡開的遊戲，缺點是遊戲好重.........

Having so many Rory Story Cubes has reduced the need for this game which is quite rule heavy, though I may implement parts of the design to encourage narrative, listening and recall skills in a competitive setting.

I think this is a well-designed game that can appeal to a wide variety of people, including children.  My rating reflects my own lack of enjoyment.  It takes a while to play and I just don't find these types of stories and memorization exercises fun at all, so the game just drags for me.

[Swan Panasia Co., Ltd. 驢橋 14 edition] {Abstract; memory, story-telling; optimal 4p}  This is a cute party game, especially for children. Players have to make up a story to help other players to remember the words on their drawn tiles.

Similar to other party games requiring creativity, players determines how much this game can be.

With 4 players, there are 20 rounds of story telling and 20 rounds guessing, quite a suitable time.  The game is a little bit long for 5-6 players, it doesn't scale well.

Fairly good drinking game (well, played alongside the company of liquor). Then - and I figure only then - this game is fun and full of laughs. Good mix of talents needed. A good memory alone won't get you far if you're not able to tell rememberable stories.Plus it's a party game that skillfully dodges the partnership/long-term friendship dilemma, that you happen to come across in quite a fair amount of other party games and I personally loathe therefore.

The idea is intriguing and clever! Maybe even a bit too clever for a game that should be easy-to-play type family game... 

We found that the it seemed to be more important to remember stories than to really tell good stories (which is a bit disappointing). There can be a lot of downtime, which really can be killer for a game like this. Left me with mixed feelings.

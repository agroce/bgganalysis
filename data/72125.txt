The 9 turn limit seemed completely arbitrary, the game ended right as it was getting going - giving it an engine game feel over an awesome space saga feel.
It was a little too mathy and there wasn't nearly enough player-interaction. Otherwise it seems like a pretty decent game.

The game is awesome.  I love the way it all fits together.
But it is practically too long.
Our first game, including being briefed on the rules (which took about 30-45 mins) was finished early after 4 hours for 4 players.  We skipped to the end, missing 2 turns (out of nine).
I realistically do not have time to justify another epic game in my collection.

This is like a board game version of Master of Orion. It has a very large number of game pieces so setup and learning the rules takes some time. However the game is very well balanced. We played a 5 player game with 4 new players and after learning the rules the game took about 3 1/2 hours. The game is complex but logical. for all it's complexity it is very well done.

Need to play more, but so far would rather play Space Empires 4X

Well I have played many more games. I originally scored this as a 7 but upgraded to a 9. Would be a 10 but for the missile issue. I would rather play this now rather than Space Empire.

Just played my first six player game and added the expansion. Now must say " What missile issue". Just rated this a 10 its that good.

Back to a 9. Its great but not enough combat for me.

RATING: 10
I've had the privilege and pleasure of being involved in the playtesting of the prototype since May 2010 and saw it evolve. The game I played back then was great.. the finished game is phenomenal! 

The game is truly an epic 4X civilization-building game, but it doesn't take all day to play. It is built upon very intuitive mechanics that allow you to play the [i]game[/i], not the system. It is in essence very much a eurogame with loads and loads of highly immersive theme seamlessly integrated into the package. 

The gameplay is so exciting it keeps you at the edge of your seat, but the balance between strategy and luck feels good (by playing smart, luck is [i]very[/i] manageable). 

First rating after first (early prototype) playtest games: [size=14][BGCOLOR=#66FF99][COLOR=#66FF99]_[/COLOR][size=8][b]8.5[/b][/size][COLOR=#66FF99]_[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR][/size] - May 2010

Improved rating after several (developed prototype) playtest games: [size=14][BGCOLOR=#00CC99][COLOR=#00CC00]_[/COLOR][size=6][COLOR=#00CC99]_[/COLOR][size=8][b]9[/b][/size][COLOR=#00CC99]_[/COLOR][/size][COLOR=#00CC99]_[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR][/size] - November 2010

Improved rating after more (late prototype) playtest games: [size=14][BGCOLOR=#00CC99][COLOR=#00CC00]_[/COLOR][size=8][b]9.5[/b][/size][COLOR=#00CC99]_[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR][/size] - March 2011

May 2011 Update: The finished game and components design is simply exceptional. If the production value is right, I fully expect to give this game full marks.

Rating after playing the the final (pre)production copy: [size=14][BGCOLOR=#00CC00][COLOR=#00CC00]_[/COLOR][size=2][COLOR=#00CC00]_[/COLOR][size=8][b]10[/b][/size][COLOR=#00CC00]_[/COLOR][/size][COLOR=#00CC00]_[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR][/size] - The quality of game components is as high as the ambitious design deserves. The game looks gorgeous and plays like a dream. I'm pretty sure this will become my favourite board game of all time.

UPDATE: I'm finding some people's complaints about "luck" more and more ridiculous. They're only indicative of their own inexperience and inability to play the game well. The rules are deceptively easy to grasp but true understanding of different strategies and how to play the game competitively might take a lot more effort. Apparently some people never get it. 

I just played a game (including the expansion in playtesting) where 6 out of my 7 explores where ancients, including my first four hex pulls and I was sitting next to Draco. I ended up discarding two hexes over the course of the game and even the only one without an ancient had a Warp gate. Sounds bad? I was "screwed by luck"? You know what happened? I won by a landslide, because I adapted to the situation and chose my strategy accordingly. 

The game has several random elements to ensure replayability and excitement, but calling it "luck-based" is a load of bull****.

Beatiful game with space exploration and combat.
It's fast (for a 4X game,if the players know the game it is 30 minutes per player), with little downtime. The different races are quite interesting (especially those from the expansions), and I wouldn't recommend to play with humans. I like a lot the possibility to upgrade your ships  in a lot of different ways, allowing very different combat strategies.
It's quite a strict game (you never have all the resources you want), but I think all the people who define eclipse a eurogame in space (I think I've seen on the forums the definition "accountants go to space") are just plain wrong imho. You have 3 different resources (used for different things) to manage, but it always requires only a look at your player board and a single sum/subtraction.

RATING: 5
Decent 'Euro-trash', but a bit theme-less and if I am going to spend a fair few hours on a 4X space game I'd rather it be TI3 or something rather.

After playing for 5 hours, it still feels like I just finished with the entree, whereas it should feel like a main course (or in case of TI3 main + seconds).


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
I find the first half of the game a bit boring since there usually won't be any player interaction until late in the game. Also, the combat system seems flawed. The worst offender is a particular weapon so extremely powerful and useful that whoever gets it usually easily win. I like the theme and uncomplicated gameplay, but all in all it is not for me. I own the ipad version.

Edit: I have played it some more and now like it even less. Now it alternates between boring and downright annoying. I'm quite certain I won't play this again.

RATING: 8
Not the epic flavor-fest that Twilight Imperium is, Eclipse holds its own ground with an innovative economic system that keeps everything moving and flowing smoothly. Taking up a ton of table-space, Eclipse does so many things right, that it creates a sort of hybrid experience, bringing some random elements of Ameritrash and crossing it with a highly polished Euro resource management system.

My favorite parts revolve around the technological improvements, building up a unique armada and testing it against your foes. You could also go the peaceful route if you'd like, exploring the system, hoping to find ancient alien technology, and establishing monoliths and orbitals along the way, gaining resources and VPs, without dealing in space battles. Or, depending on the number of players, feel free to form alliances and boost each other's resource income, defending each other against other aggressive enemies. Trading in your alliance for a quick grab of power will earn you a traitor card with negative VPs, but it just may be worth it if the opportunity presents itself. 

Eclipse is a Euro's Space Epic. It doesn't quite bring the story and expansiveness and unpredictability of other space games, but it is an effortlessly solid and glowing tribute to the sci-fi genre.

For a 4X game, I can't think of anything more to ask. It is extremely well made - in design and mechanics. It all plays like butter. However, yes indeed those missiles ruin combat. Seems like a large oversight only because the rest of the game is polished to a super-nova gleam. My largest take away is the score tile pulls which can literally swing an entire game away. It seems apparent unless you live by the sword and attack alot (thus getting alot of grabs in the bag for good VP tiles), you cannot possibly win. That the game makes you believe you *could* win without combat speaks volumes to the great design. Good game.

Si conocéis y os gustan los juegos tipo 4X, éste está muy logrado, mezcla de mecánicas euro y amerithrash, que pueden gustar o no. Creo que es un gran juego, pero un 10 al marqueting que se lo ha currado de tal forma que parezca que todavía es mejor de lo que es. No justifica el juego su hype, está muy sobrevalorado, pero no esta mal. Es un eurogame disfrazado de elementos de juegos tipo 4x americano, pero el juego tiene mucha burocracia, mucha parafernalia de economía, para al final tener varios elementos de azar muy determinante que chocan con el otro estilo euro. El juego es demasiado largo en esa burocracia, si tuviera esta mezcla, pero más directa y simplificada, estaría mucho mejor (tener que explorar al azar, a ver que tecnos estan disponibles al azar, una vez avanzas tener que ir una a una investigando tecnos, luego tener que equipar las naves otra vez, poco a poco, todo para poder moverte más, tener opciones de cambiar la probalidad a tu favor, y todo ello cuando lo tienes después de 4h de juego, un turno o 2 que te pegas de leches y el juego se acaba. No se, el diseño es bueno, pero la mezcla no acaba de ser satisfactoria.

Eclipse satisfies the need for a civilization game in almost every possible way. It is epic enough without suffering from being too long or being guilty of too much micromanaging that ultimately has no or very little impact on the outcome of the game. Every action you take feels significant and almost always you are one or two actions short of accomplishing everything you want which creates interesting trade-offs to ponder. Eclipse also manages to overcome the hurdle of book-keeping with your ever growing empire. All information is easy to read and very little time is spent on calculating things allowing you to concentrate solely on playing. And perhaps the coolest thing about the whole game is that you get to create your own ship blueprints!!!

There are a few minor things that might start to annoy you after a while though. First off, the non-player enemies (Ancients) are all the same. On the couple of first plays this won't bother you but personally I would have liked some variety to them. Now you have a bunch of standard ship blueprints you use to defeat the Ancients thus making this part of the game a bit scripted. However, the number and the timing of Ancients you encounter varies from game to game and hence this does not script the whole experience.

Another thing about the Ancients is that especially for new players they may seem invincible. Many have been ready to throw the game after "bad luck" with exploring when they have found their homeworld being surrounded by Ancients. I must say that the situation may seem dire but you can usually make a comeback and fight for the win. However, facing this kind of a situation on your first play can be truly devastating for the experience causing these players never to look back once they leave the table.

Third thing is that after a few rounds there is very little incentive to add a odd number of hull to your ship blueprints. All more powerful weapons deal an even number of damage thus making odd hull useless. Hence there are times when the Improved Hull technology feels a bit over powered to me. This feeling is further magnified by the Plasma Missile technology.

Fourth and perhaps my biggest complaint is about the art. I really like the subtle and extremely functional graphic design which helps to create a right kind of atmosphere. But oh man, the generic art on the faction sheets and the box really is not to my taste. Almost all alien races are of humanoid type thus showing very little imagination. It almost feels like watching Star Trek. Moreover, all races are portrayed from the front with their torso and face visible. It makes me feel like I am at a gallery of mugshots.

Nevertheless, despite its minor shortcomings Eclipse is truly a great game that delivers you bags of fun. You are operating on both, the short term tactical level and on the longer term strategic level. You also get the satisfaction of actually accomplishing something when you watch your empire grow. Personally I also love the sci-fi setting.

Land grab, secure borders, raise victory points, final battle.
The game is constructed to attack the leading player, however, not everybody might reach the leader.

I think the game should gain from a victory points track to clearly show who leads. Hidden reputation tiles is ok.

Only played 3 player and I imagine it gets better with more (although also a lot of downtime). So many decisions with so few actions, you're never quite able to do everything.

Finally got to play Eclipse with a group today! Overall I was very impressed. A few underwhelming aspects, and a few items seemed unbalanced, but on the whole a great streamlined empire-builder. The way a small set of components is used for multiple purposes is brilliant.

Neutron bombs are ridiculously cheap for what they do; ground combat in general is a hand wave. 

The plasma missiles are nuttily OP. 

Combat in general is very anticlimactic and, compared to the economic engine of the game, very inelegant. Like after each round of a beautiful are control game you suddenly revert to RISK to decide all confrontations. 

Lastly, it is possible for a player, through luck of the sector draw, luck of available technologies and turn order, the vagaries of 'wormhole' alignment, and presence of the Elders, to be sealed off from interaction with other players and/or economically stifled. Effective player isolation / suppression. 

This is based on 1 play of the base game. Look forward to more.

The good news is, it is the game that Space Empires should have been. And the bad news is its more expensive and got published second [and Space Empires XXXX was 20 years in the making...damn!]. We played six-player and I'm not sure that worked as well as a smaller number might. Its simple, and therefore may be good for a few plays before you turn to other Essen releases. The main variations are travel possibilities between tiles and the selections of technology tiles that are available each turn, which are concerned with warship operation and production, but of course you buy whatever is available that you can afford. So the choice is limited, even if you go first.

The trouble with simplicity is that its no friend to radical novelty, and here there are a few old clichés:  you can't fight more than one war, onesuch will bankrupt you, and the enemy can build new ships in beleaguered systems. Yawn.

After watching it at the BGG, I played my first game, and lost badly. I tried to explore backwards, and in the second round all my forward options were grabbed by someone else, so I found myself locked in. All remaining explorations got no tiles that allowed me to connect back, so I was stuck with limited resources; no chance ever.
I still liked it, and want to play again.

This really is a fantastic game!  It's an easy 9 after several games played.  Presently, the only thing keeping it from being a 10 for me is that if you do poorly in the early game, you can end up just being along for the ride for a couple hours with no hope of victory.  Maybe this impression will change as I get better with the game, though.

Update: I really, really want to enjoy the game.  Seriously, it drives me crazy, but I just don't think I do.  The issue I mentioned in my early impressions hasn't cleared up.  It feels like fairly early in the game, several people will be effectively eliminated, leaving the major players to fight it out.  These quasi-eliminated players don't really have fun for the rest of the game, and I just can't rate a game highly when several players won't enjoy it every game.

I want to love Eclipse, but I just can't.

Eclipse is fun, but as odd as it sounds, it felt a little short! I played a 2-player game and right when I felt like things kicked into high gear... the game was over! It's a solid game with good mechanics, but just feels like it's over just a little too fast. Also wish there was a little more variety to the exploration.

RATING: 5
The economic system in this game is fantastic.  I also love the tech tree.  The way hexes are explored is a bit luck dependent for this type of heavy Euro.  My major beef though is the issue of player interaction.  If you are next to an aggressive military race you are either going to be stomped or forced to spend a lot of resources protecting your home system from attack.  Conversely if someone ignores a peaceful race on the other side of the galaxy they will have an easy time, building up their economic engine.  The alliance system does nothing to address this as it averages the scores so once you have either fallen behind or have been stomped into last no one wants to ally with you. This coupled with the length of the game is Monopoly style misery.`

Absolutely incredible experience. Think Euro economic mechanics (a la Power Grid) meets territory control and combat (a la Risk), but with tech trees and customizable ships (a la the Civ video game series), all set within something like the Mass Effect universe.

Eclipse blends Euro mechanics with a great theme and fun combat mechanics. While the rulebook looks daunting, it is very well laid out, with a good portion devoted to a play-by-play example game. Couple that with UndeadViking's great how-to video, and you should be up and running in no time.

While Eclipse looks quite complicated, a graceful and elegant game lies behind the imposing appearance. With only 6 actions to choose from, the gameplay is streamlined and sensible.

The components are well-built, the art is great, and the player mat is extremely well designed and straightforward.

I had an absolute blast playing, and I can't wait to get it to the table again.

A very nice streamlined play and tech/ship levelling that fits together nicely, very keen to get this to the table some more and explore the advanced races. 4X is a tempting theme for me and with the fresher mechanics making it more like a crossbreed with something like Through the Ages (one of my all time favourites) this feels like it will be here to stay but I make this assumption about a lot of games before I play them to death.

RATING: N/A
Played for the first time for more than 10 hours, taking into consideration, we have had played for two days. Eclipse started at 17 on one day in 4 people finished on the first day with full set up and several times rule book reading, and with 2 turns at 23 o'clock. The next day we played up to turn 8 and we did not find anymore strength to continue the last turn after another 5hrs of play. Long time of play was not due to our poor mind abilities but to the strategy  each of us was trying to implement - we failed. Amount of randomness, made me frustrated but also curious how will this game go next time with a different 'non-strategical' approach. We will see. For now, no rating...I do not want to be biased. 
___________________
Played for the second time in 3. Even though I won, I do not like the amount of randomness in the game. Actually everything is random: hexes you discover, bonus points you get (from the bag or by fighting)... I like a lot though the quality of pieces and the smart player-friendly counters. Great job with putting so many detail on the playmats which really speed up the game. I will try to play with different races next time as the 'human' version is pretty boring even as on just second time of play. 

____________
On the night from 24th to 25th March we played Eclipse in 5. Only two of us played the game before. We played for more than 2.5hr and it was horrible. We all agreed that the amount of randomness in the game actually killed the play. I was stuck in my part of universe, without even one Ancient to fight. After each of us explored all the hexes it was only turn 6. From that point on for three (3) turns all the actions became redundant and 'artificial' feeling that you have so many options was discovered. I gathered 21VP just by building Monoliths - isn't it crazy?! Very unbalanced and punishing game! And this 'to the roof' amount of randomness... More I play, more I'm disappointed. Changed my rating from 9 to 7 and now to 6.

Very solid 4X game, good mix of Euro and Ameritrash elements. I'd have preferred the races to be simpler in their distinctions from one-another (a la Terra Mystica). As it is each has several fairly specific rules. I also am firmly in the 'missiles are OP' category which is a shame. We house rule a bit, as we consider building in areas already under attack is unthematic, as is the not being able to access techs not drawn (we play you CAN get them if you're willing to pay a higher price).

Abstract:
"Fast" 4X space game with economic elements.

Prs:
+ Quite fast
+ Upgrading ships is fun
+ Alliance system (light and easy, but no real trading)
+ Ability to still react after passing
+ The economy system is cool, but lots of cubes require a game board that holds all of them in place

Neutrals:
# NPC aliens are quite fun, however, they appear too randomly and may encircle you in the beginning of the game.
# Upkeep limits your actions
# You have to diversify your technologies
# Two-Step for technology research + upgrade may feel a bit slowly
# Traitor mechanic can lead to stalemates
# Minis are okay (lacking details)

Cons:
- Tight resources and economic emphasis forces you to play rather efficient, cautious, and avoid losses. 
- Tight resources likely restrict your ability to move or act, if you do not research the right technologies.
- Too much randomness: exploration / hex tiles, ancient tiles, victory tiles, technology tiles, missiles
- Strong focus on combat because of victory tiles.
- Combat gets clunky: compare all ship-types' abilities and match them with each dice roll
- Artwork is not good (hopefully be better in second edition)
- Fiddly due to lots of technology tiles: frequently search or sort them
- No catch-up mechanic: it quickly gets even worse as soon as you loose a lot of ships or a system (the upkeep system does not mitigate that well enough)

Thoughts:
Eclipse (first edition) is a quite fast, fun 4X space game. My biggest complaint is the luck-factor which occurs nearly everywhere in the game. I also do not like the focus on combat which is strongly awarded by the game. Regardless of all negative points, I still like to play Eclipse.
I like Twilight Imperium 4th Edition much better - it is not that much longer with 5-6 players, more elegant, deeper, and epic.

Similar to:
* Exodus: Proxima Centauri is very similar to Eclipse but seems to be better in most parts. It is a bit more aggressive. It also has an expansion to play coop!

A tight, well-designed Euro-style ruleset with very little clutter makes for very close, very strategic games. I'm especially a fan of the starship upgrade mechanic, which introduces a ton of variety and flexibility to your military tactics.

There is one semi-dominant military strategy, which is balanced out in the expansion; I don't recommend playing without Rise of the Ancients.

Eclipse is a fun war game that is on the heavier side.  Gameplay is also somewhat long but not a marathon and setup is lengthy as well.  This game offers a good balance with resource gathering, space exploration, customizing your own ships, and, of course, combat.  The advantages to being peaceful do not seem to be big enough to warrant that as a legitimate option but I also have never played with more than 4 people so maybe the diplomatic metagame provides more advantages that are not incorporated into the game itself.  Overall, Eclipse is a 
decent game.

RATING: 9.5
Very very very VERY fun game!  It has several shades of wargame to make it very fun, but primarily about running economics of empire.  This combination means it appeals to players not big on fighting as well as those thirsting for some battles.  
Was expecting to play this with brother/friends.  When my wife found out it was limited to 9 rounds, she agreed to give it a try.
She loved it.
Then she convinced my sister-in-law, who prefers non-confrintational games, to give it a try.
She liked it too!!!
That's how strong the economic side of the game is, it drew them both in.  Looks like we are going to be playing this a lot!

Why not higher?  Well, it's still not my kind of game.  Fun, yes, but very directed.  While this is an exceedingly good game, I don't see it bringing anything particularly novel or exciting to the 4x style other than its ease of access.  A great game but not a must for me.

Eclipse is a good game and a missed 10 for me, since this game has a lot of great ideas and mechanisms, but I've really a problem with some of its aspects. I love the technologies, the possibility to customize the spaceships and the different powers of the alien races. The components are great and the artwork is excellent! I like the different strategies, the action selection mechanism and the combat resolution.

What brings this game down to be "just" a good game is basically a combination of rules that I don't like. The bag is the first one, because I think it's a very stupid way to determine the points you receive from a battle. It doesn't makes sense at all and it just adds unnecessary and negative randomness to the game, that can cause significant point swings. I also have a problem with the exploration, because you can get some bad random tiles and find yourself simply behind the others for that only. I know that you are supposed to fight for the best tiles, but it still bothers me that someone can jump ahead just because he/she was lucky enough to find the good ones.

Eclipse could have been the game I was searching for as a 4X game, but - for these issues - it's "just" a medium-good game that failed to be awesome for me. I still enjoy it, but I'm a little annoyed by some simply strange rules.

RATING: 9.5
It was the first scy fi game I've played, and I have a very good care of this one, it is relatively simple and elegant, beautiful.

The best part in this game is the way you build the blueprints of your ships, researching tecnology to build new wepon, shield, computer, energy source, hull. The customization of your ship and build for combat is great.

The way you track the incomming of the resources is very elegant, too, despite of the long setup.

Tecnology track is good, but there is an unecessary randomness here, the way to mitigate this is trying to be the first player, to guarantee the best tecnology available first. The alternate order of play variant, or the order of pass play variant makes this even better and fair. The only problem here is that some key strategies may not work if you need an advanced economy, or advanced science, mining.

The exploration is very interesting and makes the game change every new play. Of course you can be stuck if you find just ancient ships in the first round and be surrounded by them and be not possible to colonize the new sectors discovered. But in the other hand when you fight them, if you fight them earlier, you have a good chance to collect better reputation.

The combat is simple and functional, and have lots of modifiers depending on the type of wepon, quantity of cannons, difference between the computer and the shield and of course the thick of the hulls.

The different races put an assimetry of play in this game, after some plays it seems balanced.

I love to play this game.

Rating is probationary; the design is slick in a lot of ways, and easy to learn, and flows, and there are numerous things to do.  The problem is that it feels like a "civ" game but your civ is too simple.  Entering the arena with Through the Ages is dangerous; the reduced play time buys some slack, but not enough slack to cover how boring parts of this seem so far.  Or, "needs some cards."  Not to increase the luck (there's plenty of that) but to add variation beyond which resources show up (which governs your economic development too much).

Ok, it's deadly dull.  Deadly.  Dull.

(copy-pasted from Scythe comment)

To me Scythe feels like an evolution from Eclipse. Same hexagonal play area (but not modular), same central galactic core (factory), asymmetric powers, space ships (mechas).

Scythe lacks an exploration phase, and the opportunity for players to build their galaxy by choosing how to place system tiles.

Also, there is no mecha customization, whereas spaceship design is a strong suit of Eclipse.

In Scythe combat is much more streamlined, which is really a plus, but it's much less epic than with Eclipse.

Scythe offers more modularity in the asymmetric powers by randomly combining two player faction boards, whereas Eclipse has fixed boards (but more of them with the expansions).

Artwork in Scythe completely crushes Eclipse. Scythe art is beautiful and distinct, Eclipse artwork is generic and uninspired.

Eclipse plays nine turns, Scythe endgame is activated by achieving 6 "goals", which is a mechanic I disliked.

I had the feeling that Scythe played faster than Eclipse.

Scythe has a popularity mechanic, whereas Eclipse only has a puny "traitor" negative tile.

Scythe has a seemingly great solo module, but as I don't own neither Eclipse, nor Scythe, that is irrelevant to me.

Given the choice, I'll play Eclipse any time over Scythe. The tension, epic scale, diversity of strategies are much grander in Eclipse than Scythe.

Please, design Eclipse with better artwork, and fix the combat mechanic.

RATING: 5
Space opera of Sid Meyer civ. Suffers from the same problem as SM Civ. 

The player beside you are the deciding factor of your gaming experience. Movement between hexes are limited to what happens beside you. 

Conflict is simple but still dependent on die roll. 

How strange can this get? You can't develope missiles or it's equivalence because someone beat you to the token? Similarly for whatever tech you are talking about.???

First hurdle are the icons, just like RACE to Galaxy. 

An average game in all sense of the word. 

Updated : Another fruitless game. Nothing entertaining even when all are taking human factions. Feeling of the game remains exactly what I have reviewed. Tried to deny all the short comings but they are indeed significantly prominent. Better than Risk but for 6 hours spent I begin to doubt that this time was better spent on Stella Conquest, SE 4X or Here I Stand. As compared to games I've played ......average is really a good descriptive word for this game. Thanks for all the fish.

Otherwise, it feels a bit too lengthy to warrant a higher score or it would have it.

A game of Eclipse places you in control of a vast interstellar civilization, competing for success with its rivals. You will explore new star systems, research technologies, and build spaceships with which to wage war. There are many potential paths to victory, so you need to plan your strategy according to the strengths and weaknesses of your species, while paying attention to the other civilizations' endeavors.

There are lots of things I like about Eclipse (exploring, techs, the 4x style, customizing my ships, variable player powers). There are some things I particularly don't like (too much luck in combat, mainly). It's a good game, I just don't love it overmuch. Which is too bad, because there's too few games out there shooting for the '4x' or 'light civ' style. 

If the combat was less swingy, I'd like it more. If there were just a few more options to build up your civ other than the generic monuments for VP and techs that by and large enhance your ability for warfare--I'd like it a lot more. Another thing I wish is that there were more interesting races. Some of them are cool. Others are... eh. More of the same.

I think it's "very good" mainly because it's the only option available in its weight and category, so go Eclipse for being there! It's also "very good" mainly if and because you can play it in a reasonable amount of time. If players drag the game on... it can be a drag. But Eclipse does its best, I think, to try to keep the game clipping along. So thanks for that, Eclipse.

Good game, but can feel pretty dry and math-y for what really should be an exciting game with space and ships and combat and whatnot.  I don't really like how stretched out things can be - it rarely feels like there are single decisive moves because everything takes a bunch of fiddling around and preparing before you can take your actions, then only the last turn matters for scoring.  I prefer Twilight Imperium, I suppose.

Really slick way of handling overhead / upkeep / etc. with a Through the Ages style of token usage, and there are always things that you'll want to do.

However, the game feels excessively like it's pretty much just ship design and then dice-rolling. Which means that there's a lot of fluff. Exploration and colonization (you'll want to do both ... there aren't really hard decisions regarding these). Diplomacy (it's a pretty thin game mechanism). 

Finally, the actual technologies. I'm not completely sure about the missiles (or, perhaps, missiles + gluon computers). They may or may not be broken, but they sure as hell make the game a whole lot less fun.

People say that this game is Twilight Imperium Lite. To me, the two games are very, very different. I do enjoy various aspects of Eclipse, including the civilization management aspect and how ship upgrades and technology work. However, I often feel like games of Eclipse all play out very similarly, which gets old for me. I often find myself wishing for the deeper strategy and scale of TI. For me, Eclipse focuses more on economic development, where TI emphasizes military, diplomacy and politics, and economic management equally. I'll still play Eclipse when given the opportunity, but more often than not, I will prefer TI.

After three plays of Eclipse, I'm admiring the cleverness of its design more than enjoying it as a game.  The way in which it applies euro design principles to the bloated, fiddly 4x genre, making systems streamlined and intuitive is really, really impressive.

Most impressive to me is the resource system.  Just three resources, with each planet supplying one type.  Eclipse's system of  the space vacated by population cubes transferred from your player board to those planets keeping track of your income works like a charm.  

The action system is pretty clever too.  Influence discs are spent both on taking actions and on controlling sectors of space, so it's cheaper for a smaller, more efficient empire to get things done. What's more, even with six players, the single action per player turn means that there is little downtime.  

The tech system rewards the player who develops steadily along one branch of the tech tree with discounts.  However,there aren't the A to B to C constraints of some other games.

So, lots to admire, but...Are there real strategic alternatives?  An  arms race to gain an advantage in the ship technologies seems inevitable.  To compete technologically you need more resources, so you need more planets; staying small but efficient doesn't appear a realistic option.

A couple more caveats. The alien races are more interesting to play than the humans, but they don't seem well balanced.  Second, the game ends after nine turns and there are no victory points for surviving ships.  According to your tastes, this either brings the game to an exciting climax or leads to rather gamey end of the universe sorts of behaviour.

The graphic design of Eclipse is clear and functional, and shows how to do icons well.  The artwork is less inspired.  The second edition rulebook is a model of clarity.

After a few more games this appears to be a game that pretends to have skill, but seems to just depend on luck of the draw - particularly of explore bonuses.

I have no idea how this is a top 50 game, much less a top 10.  It isn't bad... but it just isn't that good.  However I'll certainly play it more.

Also it sucks with 3 people (4 is better).

-----

1st Game took a while and there are a lot of parts.  The game seems pretty good, but really doesn't strike me as one of the best games ever made.  Somehow it just seems like there are too many pieces with overly simple combat.  Also there is no Diplomacy w/ 2 or 3 people, so I'll have to try that out.

I guess I was hoping for more of a Command & Colors system crossed with Race for the Galaxy.

Oh man, this game really hits all the right notes for me.  I love 4X games to death on the PC so any tabletop counterparts are automatically on my "must buy" list.  I have yet to get this one in front of my regular group, but I have played a few 2 player games.  2 player is decent, but I think Eclipse will shine with 4-6 players.

The population cubes and influence discs are a super elegant way to keep track of how your empire is growing.  Hex based exploration is basically the only way to do it right.  I love the ship customization aspects as well.

The two things I don't care for have super easy fixes.  One, the cubes get knocked around too easily.  I've already purchased some acryllic cube holders that solve that issue.  Two, I hate the ships!  I think they don't look all that great.  This might get fixed as well, since I think the developer is working on some kind of 'bonus pack' or something with alternate ships to use.

RATING: 5
Has a run away leader problem. Starting surrounding systems can cripple players. Rather restrictive resource management can lead to dull gameplay. Ridiculous late game flurry of cheap last minute activities.

Can be played quicker than most 4x games. Unique species. If you love Euro you'll likely better enjoy this. Cool upgrades for ships. Lacks personality and theme.

A highly rated game I should enjoy, but just don't.

We just got this! I love it! Lots of fun to play. Lots of different paths to win. Learning didn't take too long and the first game flowed reasonably well. I think the mechanics scratch many itches. I really enjoyed the battle with dice; perhaps for the nostalgia of playing Risk, but the fact that you can upgrade your ships and increase your odds is awesome. Great fun, great game!
It is the first long game that my husband asked to play again right away, despite the fact that it was 1am already. 
For now, my rating is based on my first 2 plays which were 2 player games. I wonder if it will be just as good with more. I suspect it will be better.

Finally got a chance to try Eclipse last week and it was worth the wait.  Other than the fact that it is not historical, in terms of both theme and mechanics, it has virtually everything that I find compelling in a strategic game.  Technology ladder, grand scope, economic engine, strategic and tactical play, risk taking, direct but muted conflict (and thus a nearly ideal amount of player interaction from my POV).  Of the games I've played in the last 2 years, the only one that exceeds it is Dominant Species and that might just because I know the game better.  There are a lot of moving parts, but the mechanics are very intuitive and other than keeping track of and remembering the technologies (which would not have been a problem if we had a cheat sheet available), the game is remarkably easy to pick up.

:arrowE: [u]Synopsis[/u]:
eXplore. eXpand. eXploit. eXterminate. A gorgeous 4X game which is secretly a concise Euro gilt with Ameritrash glory. Diplomacy, backstabbing, resource management, empire management, variable powers, custom ship design, tech-tree-which-is-not-on-rails, long term strategy, tactical agency, big tiles, big ships, lots of cubes and discs, amazing insta-upkeep display for each player, intuitive combat modifiers and economic planning, strong graphic design, theme-if-you-want-it, and tons of variability and combos. Eclipse is, without a doubt, a game that touches on essentially everything I want out of a board game. 

:arrowE: [u]What I like most[/u]:
It's a toss-up between the customized ship design via technology, and the overall emergent gameplay between aggression and turtling. To the first point, the majority of researched technology unlocks ship parts which can be slotted over the schematics for various ships and fixed structures. This means that one player can pursue heavy, tanky ships with lots of hull, others can focus very energy-intensive and expensive weapons, while others can focus on maneuverability and targeting--in fact, most games see a small meta develop based on what is being slapped on what ships, so everyone responds accordingly. To the second point, everyone gets victory points for combat, but that doesn't mean you need to be a warmonger. Spreading oneself too thin affords for eventual losses without defense, while doing very little combat at all can be stilling from a points perspective. Balancing the two extremes is very cool. Firing Anti-Matter Cannons into someone's face is also very cool.

:arrowE: [u]What I like least[/u]:
Like any game with negotiation and emergent alliances, there is the possibility for kingmaking here. It doesn't happen often, but it's happened to me, and that sucks. Period.

The game I so wanted to hate. After I missed the first printing, I had to listen to everyone on the geek talk about how great it was, and I so wanted them to be wrong. I still cannot believe it is a replacement for Twilight Imperium, but it is a tremendously compelling alternative. I cannot wait for the expansion.

We played with the rules from the box. I heard about some errata released on BGG, but we played without it. It has its minuses of course, but it is one of the best games played in 2011 and definitely something to play again and soon.

The design is extremely functional. Even if not winning, the game is enjoyable and the giant amount of components are all well designed and useful throughout the game.

I would love a play with the designers of the game.

there some very cool mechanics in this game.
the random availability of the technologies.
you can only keep four bonus victory point chits for battle.
the cost of doing your actions and upkeep of colonies.

but i think this game is weighted to much towards being all about combat for my taste.  it seems to really only have one victory path.

Also.. What's with the plastic space ships and wooden cubes? lets get some consistency in our game production.  be Euro style or Ameritrash, not a hotch potch of both in a failing effort to keep costs down..

Great exploration/space civ/combat game with lots to think about. 2 games played, and twice I have pretty much lost out due to pulling bad hexes in the first 2 rounds. Third game I scored 74 in a 3 player, with a better initial draw. Not so good with 6 players as the game takes too long.

RATING: 7
This is bordering on being a lower rating for me. Although I think it's a very good system I really wish the development of the technology and ships had been geared towards more levels of exploration, rather than just combat. OK - it's a war game, but the whole combat aspect felt archaic and for me it it would have been much more interesting to have explored deeper and more rewarding corners of the galaxy, rather than develop the ability to roll loads of dice.

RATING: 7
For what this game aspires to be, a space-based war game with some euro mechanics thrown in, this game is excellent, and in its own way, well-designed.  

This game has a very steep learning curve in terms of all the ship capabilities, and on first play (we played with 5 players, two experienced, 3 first timers including myself) it took over 4 hours to play, which for my tastes, is too long...and I won the game.

This game is rightly considered a war game, and is undoubtedly creating a frenzy of excitement with the war gamers at BGG, which I think is great.  It is worthy.  

The interesting thing to consider for me, going forward, is whether the euro gamers at BGG (like me) will rate this war game as highly.  For us, there are some euro aspects to the game: resource management, exploration, monument building (though they are small, ugly chits), and I suppose, building a cool ship with pride of ownership, but fundamentally, and predominantly, this is a war game.  

If you don't like war games, you are not going to like this game.  If you don't like attacking and rolling dice, and being attacked and rolling dice, you won't like this.  Hate Risk? You won't like this game.

It is a good game, but... For starters, the art did not impress me. You can do a lot on your turn and throughout the whole game, but there is that AGOT element which I don't like. Furthermore, a player can be eliminated if other players gankup on him. Just by hushing other players on one guy, and I don't like that. If you need to hush other players to kill some other player (A), then A has already won. Because he is obviously the best (because other players must stop him).
On the other hand, I like the tech tree, the resource and action management. The exploration and upgrading of ships is also very nice.

Finally got this to the table and managed to play half a game.  The group was enthralled.  I completely expect this to be a 10, although still going to be quite difficult to bring it out consistently.

===
We played a full second game and it was still hugely enjoyable.  Favourite part was that, although I didn't win, I did cost the winning player (who was my direct adversary all game) to lose by forging an alliance and immediately attacking another player to break it (setting him back a VP token of actual value).  Everyone still wants to play more.
Perhaps not perfect, but easily warrants its position on the charts (still think the overall 'economy' mechanic is brilliant).

===
So some time has settled and we've played with the expansion, and I think there's only so much to like about Eclipse.  What probably made it so enjoyable the first few times when we didn't finish is that the game is most exciting in the first few turns and peaks at the mid-point.  It's often easy to tell who will win by that point, making the rest of the game a slow grind to the finish for everyone else.  Alliances don't have a 'nicely handled' version at this point, which compounds this problem.
The technology tree is still nice, especially with building your own ships.  The economy engine is also still really smart.  But it just falls flat past a point.

While playing it feels like success is highly impacted by luck, but I guess that's also because I lack experience to balance that.

Based on play length Vs fun playing, I should grade much lower, I almost left the table on second game which is highly unusual for me. 

I'll give it another go see if I can actually enjoy myself for the full length of the game and not feel "out of the race" after 3-4 turns.

Un muy buen juego que podría calificarse de Eurogame pero con algo más. 

Tiene su toque 4x pero dentro de un tiempo razonable y para jugar casi con cualquier tipo de jugador. 

Con una complejidad mediana incluye desarrollo de tecnología, combate, exploración, unas gotas de diplomacia, gestión de recursos, interacción entre jugadores... no creo que se pueda pedir más en 2-3 horas.

Veo siempre con excepticismo los Eurogames, pq suelen ser una fotocopia unos de otros y con el tema prácticamente de adorno. Pero este es diferente y tengo que reconocer que realmente es bueno. El tema está bien implementado, las mecánicas funcionan a la perfección, es bonito, los componentes tienen calidad y lo más importante de todo, es divertido.

Ojalá se hicieran más Eurogames así. Seguramente mi opinión sobre ellos cambiaría bastante.

Too long and too formulaic.  I do not understand why the best strategy is to rapidly explore to get enough territory for yourself.  Why does space run out of systems because my opponents explored them all on the other side of the map?  Plasma missiles are also a problem, as they force the game to go down a particular path.  No other technology requires your neighbours to so radically retool their fleets.

What is really annoying about this game is the fact that it is in the top 10 of BGG. It doesn't deserve it and it is something that I don't understand.

First of all there is terrible randomness in one of the more important elements of the game during the first round: the exploration. One player can draw an excellent tile with Planets full of production or even a technology without effort while other player can find an ancient enemy and therefore has to build ships and spend time conquering it and maybe not to get a great reward. To sum up, you can be out of the game since the very start. 

Absurd randomness is still present in the technology that players can research. The middle of the game consists in a race struggling for this technology and more ships, more than that struggling to buy a technology the wich your opponents can not resist because generally is not possible to get a copy of it or even the technology that matches it doesn't appear from the bag.  

So we get the last round where the man who were lucky, bought that technology and armed his ships with it, devastates the other players, wins the play and the others feel like idiots.
 
Its rating in BGG has not sense, and I am not eager to play this game ever again.

-------

Lo que fastidia de este juego es cómo puede estar en el top 10 de BGG. Simplemente no lo merece y es algo que no puedo entender. 

Lo primero de todo, hay un azar terrible en uno de los elementos más importantes durante los primeros compases de partida: La exploración. 
Un jugador puede robar una loseta llena de planetas con producción, o incluso obtener una tecnología gratis sin esfuerzo alguno, mientras que otro se encuentra a enemigos ancestrales, por lo que tiene que gastar más tiempo y fabricar naves inmediatamente para conquistar esa loseta y obtener una recompensa que puede ser incluso poca cosa. En resumidas cuentas, te puedes ver fuera de la partida desde el turno uno. 

El azar absurdo sigue presente en la tecnología que los jugadores pueden investigar. La parte media de la partida consiste en una carrera para obtener tecnología y naves, o más bien, para obtener una tecnología que el resto de jugadores no puedan contrarrestar porque es habitual que no se pueda obtener una copia de ella o la tecnología que la contrarresta no sale de la bolsa, o no todos pueden tenerla. 

Así llegamos a la ronda final, donde el hombre que tuvo suerte, que consiguió dar con esa tecnología irresistible y que con ella arma sus naves, pasa por encima de sus enemigos en un combate final que importa poco, gana la partida y el resto se sienten como idiotas. 

No se entiende su puntuación y desde luego no tengo ganas de repetir experiencia tras una primera partida.

Rating based on one play.

After reading the instructions and setting up, I was a little skeptical of how much I would like this.  I've been underwhelmed in the past by some designs that tried to mimic the complexity of computer games.  I felt I spent so much time doing the accounting -- the part the computer should be doing -- that it was hard to get into the game.

But I found this to not be the case with Eclipse.  The accounting was very easy and came naturally.  And that left me free to focus on a game with a wide variety of comprehensible choices and strategies.  I'm looking forward to playing it again.

Complex mix of exploration, resource management, and combat. Luck in early exploration phase can really impact a player's outcomes. More players increase the occurrence of combat. Combat mechanic is interesting variation that reduces the extreme variation of straight dice rolls. A fun game that really builds and changes over time. The 30 min suggested play time is overly optimistic.

RATING: 9
Excellent use of exploration mechanics, Nice combat mechanics that allows you to modify your ships to fit the threats or attacks you are about to make. Good feel, it recreates the theme very well.  Some races are a bit more powerful than others, but very manageable.  One thing that everybody would agree is that it take WAY too long to setup, and it needs a BIG table to play due to the exploration tiles being so big.  If it weren't for that I would gladly give it a 10.  It plays good with 3-5 players.  Turns take a little bit long due to the strategic shifting of the game (you could have one strategy but it might change as soon as you see one of your opponents building ships or maybe making alliances).  One game could possibly take 3-4 hours, but I will guarantee that it will be a lot of tension and its extremely hard to get the "Runaway leader" effect.  Highly recommended for regular board gamers.  If you are a casual gamer, I would give it a chance but I warn you that it takes a long time to play and a long time to setup, so be PATIENT (the game is worth it).  The price it a little bit to high for casual gamers, but for veteran gamers its perfect, due to the amount of pieces this game had.  The races in the game are nice, and even if you just play humans all the time it seems that every race has its own theme.  Before you completely say NO to this game I highly suggest you play it with 3 players.

Bad exploration pulls can really make a game less interesting, even if players "self-balance" by leaving them alone for a while. It seems to me that things could be improved by strengthening combat pulls and weakening non-combat pulls (e.g. swapping wildcard colonization planets with tracked ones), but what do I know? Setup is an issue, can be mitigated. Also helped with tricks like putting face-down lv1 and lv2 tiles in a ring (discards can be replaced). Biggest issue, I think, is a familiar one for wargamers: the End of the World syndrome. Suicide runs, etc. Could be mitigated a lot with a different scoring mecahnism. After all this I'd say, still fun, and just a stunning job on iconography and usability. The look and feel doesn't do it for me, but holy cow, great usability design.

10/6/16: Bumped up to a 10.  This game is a great experience and the best of its class.

8/13/2015: Bumped up from an 8 to a 9 because this still gets fairly regular play 3 years on in my gaming group.

3/28/12: The latest must have 'it' game.  A very nice space exploration game, and it does several things right.  Good production values, well playtested, and not rushed into production unlike so many other games these days.

In my opinion better than Twilight Imperium, which I consider overwrought.  Certainly faster paced that Twilight Imperium, but not a thematic game.  Like most civ building games, there is development of an economic engine under the hood, and I appreciate that more than the combat.  I do like the part of being able to customize your ships, and I'm starting to see that there is some skill in how you upgrade. I disagree with others that say this game ends too soon.

However I've got this nagging feeling that after the initial glow wears off, this will be a very good game, but not the end all game.  For me it's perhaps biased a little too much towards combat, though I won by avoiding combat.  This is a nit, but the colors for the 3 resources are a little too close together.  Rating more likely to go up than down.  

One thing that has me nervous is that more than one battle has been decided by who could be the first to roll a 6 on their dice.  There is a moderate amount of luck in this game and you need to be comfortable with that.

Just starting to learn the differences in the races.  My perspective is that the Eridani are harder to play than the others.  Will have to spend more time with this.

Plays well with 4-6 players.  Played 5 players with 3 newbies in 4 hours.  A little concerned that in 5 players, the ones on the edge have the advantage.  With more players it can become a much more aggressive game due to limited resources.

RATING: 5
Overall, I was left feeling disappointed with this game. It has plenty of interesting and clever mechanics, though in fairness it owes quite a bit to Through the Ages. It also felt like it could flow quite smoothly, implying a short playtime, neither a given in these kind of civilization games. In terms of the game design, however, I had a big issue with the high degree of randomness: not so much the combat, where it can to a very large extent be minimized through smart ship design, but in the exploration and research steps - you can consistently get poor tiles and be locked out of important technologies you didn't know were coming through turn order quirks. I also didn't much care for the fact you can keep building ships in systems with enemy presence.

In the end, though, my biggest problem with the game is personal: I find I simply don't much enjoy these kind of development and confrontation games (though Through the Ages is a big exception, probably due to the more abstract military interaction). I generally tend to be too pacifist, and I think that sucks some of the fun out of them, particularly if other people behave similarly.

I might try this again, but it won't be for some time, and then I'd want to play with some house rules to mitigate the randomness.

Euro style 4X.  Just Excellent.  I don't even mind the dice based combat in this one.  Beautiful board and components.  The economy is so well done as you balance growth against available resources.

RATING: 8
Good theme, good ideas yet a little too much luck. Putting in all those details does not help when actually micromanaging all of them is rendered useless by a little bit bad luck during exploration and combat rolls. Still tempting, the mechanics are clever.  

Also, what I do not really understand is how people like the art style here so much. Yes, it's functional, but that's about it... At least there are wooden cubes to assure me this is an Euro game. Wait, what?

RATING: 10
This is a really good game. I expected it to be quite heavy due to the number of pieces (it took an hour and a bit to punch and sort), but (after 30 mins of reading the rules) the game is relatively simple and lighter than it looks.

RATING: 10
Best strategy boardgame I've ever played. Simple rules you learn during your first game, lots of different ways of winning, good amount of economy and strategic warfare. Although the political interaction with other players is a bit light and the game needs a big table for playing I still give this game full 10.

RATING: 8
The only reason this isn't an 8 is the length of gameplay. I expect every game will be different due to the order of tech tiles removed from the bag. And the mix of alien roles around the table will also probably lead to changes in gameplay as well.

Where to start?

The technology system is bullshit.  You can scoop a tech via turn order, and then your opponent cannot research it, ever.  That's exactly the opposite way the technology works in real life, which is: You develop a technology, and your adversaries copy or steal it.

The exploration system is bullshit.  While all planets are more-or-less balanced overall, some people find awesome planets for their current situation, while others find flaming plasma death.  Since this is an economic game, finding unguarded planets early is a huge booster.

The scoring system is bullshit.  There are a set number of game turns, so feel free to do unthematic things like dismantling your empire, throwing your remaining fleet into a meat grinder, and researching worthless techs just to maximize your score.  Also, the grab bag of random battle chits is silly.  If you want to reward early aggression, just make those early chits worth more points.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
FAIR WARNING: My rating is off one play, and could easily adjust if I play it more.

...but the odds that it would get more plays is low. It's just not my style of game...it's a little too confrontational for my liking, and then it comes down to roll of the dice (as military always seems to), AND it's likely going to end up being very long. If I'm going to invest that much time into a game it will probably be something I just immediately liked better.

So, I would say the quality of the game (in terms of components, design, and execution) is an 8, but the amount that I like it is more in line with a 4...hence the 6 I gave it.

Extremely meaty. It feels like what Twilight Imperium WANTS to be. It was said best today: "I do not see a situation in which I would want to play Twilight Imperium over this."

Update: I've now played TI3 again, and this does not feel nearly as epic. This is more *convenient* to play, but is not as satisfying.

RATING: 10
Combat probably could use *something* to minimise the impact of dice, and RotA doesn't quite fix the mid-game slump, but there is so much depth in the game that every play yields an interesting story, and the mechanics are about as elegant as they come. The game well and truly is greater than the sum of its parts, and it is about the most epic game you can finish in one evening.

16-IX-2012. Por dónde empezar... Este juego está hecho para mí. En todo. Temática, aspecto, posibilidades, estrategias, mecánicas... Una maravilla. 

4 fases:
-A. El jugador inicial escoge entre seis acciones, muy intuitivas todas, la ejecuta (que durará unos 30 segundos) y pasa el turno al siguiente jugador que puede elegir una acción o pasar. Así hasta que todos pasan.
-B. Después, si hay contacto en un mismo hexágono de dos o más jugadores se resuelve a base de toñas con un sistéma de combate muy bien implementado y nada engorroso.
-C. Una fase de pago y cobro (unkeep), (que me evoca mucho al aroma del Through the Ages).
-D. Y para terminar una fase de limpieza muy sencilla y fácil de seguir.

El juego en realidad gira sobre tres de detalles: 
- Tres tipos de recursos (materiales, dinero y tecnología).
- Todos los planetas proporcionan uno de estos tres tipos de materiales. Por medio de un sistéma ingenioso y sencillo, mandas tus trabajadores especializados a trabajar esos mundos y recolectar este tipo de recursos... Cuantos más trabajadores tengas recolectando, más recurso recibirás en la fase de mantenimiento. De tal manera que todo está muy relacionado y de nada sirve expandirte y enfatizar en un tipo de recurso si dejas de lado los otros dos.  
- los discos que sirven para dos cosas: realizar tus acciones (a modo de trabajadores del Caylus) y reclamar los exágonos de la galaxia como tuyos (colocando uno de esos discos). Cuantos más discos uses, más dinero te costará pagar en la fase de unkeep.

Y ya está. Algún detalle más pero sencillo, intuitivo y con miles de posibilidades. Destacar sobre todo el manual y los iconos de todo el juego. Una currada del diseñador que habría que premiar. 

Para mí un diez. Always want to play y blablabla.

20-IV-2014.Edito: pedazo de juego. Ayer jugamos con las razas alienígenas por primera vez y el juego es delicioso. No le veo ninguna pega, me amoldo al juego perfectamente y todo lo veo tan perfectamente integrado y cohesionado que me hace disfrutar la partida como en pocos juegos. 
24-I-2015: Después de jugar cuatro partidas más con las razas le voy a poner una pega: si tienes mala suerte, la partida puede hacerse difícil. No siempre se tienen las mismas posibilidades de disfrutar, la suerte importa a la hora de descubrir mundos, naves, avances gratuitos... No me refiero al dado en el combate, esa suerte está asumida y agradecida, es... es otro rollo. Le voy a bajar la nota un pelín, porque eso no me pasa con los juegos a los que tengo puesto un 10. ¿9,8?. Vaya!, que me sigue chiflando!!

first impressions are quite positive.  A very thoughtful, clever design.  Overall it feels slick and smart.  My first and only game so far had surprisingly very little direct conflict, so I wonder how it will play in different groups.  3 seems like the sweet spot time-wise but 5-players (while longer) is probably more dynamic.

looking forward to more.

oh yea...table space is an issue.  those player mats are huge.  probably best on a nice big round playign surface.

Pont ma került be a játék a top10-be (és előzte meg a Caylust), kíváncsian vártam hát, hogy kiderüljön, mitől ennyire nagy durranás. A szabály nagyon biztató volt...

És most, hogy kipróbáltam, azt kell mondjam, hogy nagyon jó játék, de azért nem egy műfajteremtő, korszakos darab. Sok jó ötlet van benne, sok régi dolog is visszaköszön persze, de a fő erénye, hogy jól össze van gyúrva. Emellett szép is. De nincs benne az általam eddig próbáltak közt a legjobb 10-ben.

Pozitívumok: Azt írtam az előbb, nem műfajteremtő a játék, de a worker placement műfajban mégis egy új evolúciós szintet képvisel, mert az akcióválasztó bábuk itt többfunkciósak, így minél több a területünk, annál kevesebb akciót tudunk választani. Az egyes akcióknak nem önálló költségei vannak, hanem az egész civilizációnknak van egy összköltsége. Számomra nagy újdonság a passz mechanizmusa: bizonyos akciók még passz után is használhatók korlátozott mértékben (=reakció). Jó ötlet a különféle (diplomácia ill. csatából származó) győzelmi pontok korlátja is (max 5 pontlapka). Bár diplomáciát nem használtunk (3 főnél nincs), jó ötlet az is (meg az áruló lapka is). Talán érhetne többet is, mint 1-1 pont. Mi csak az alap (földi) fajokkal játszottuk, a táposabb fajokkal szerintem nagyban nőhet az újrajátszhatóság. A csaták jók, az űrlapkák felépítése (életterek 2 szintje) is tetszik. Profi az ikonrendszer, igényes az egész (engem nem zavar a műanyag).

Negatívumok: sokan játszva durva hosszú lehet, nekünk 3 fővel volt 3 óra, szerintem 6 fővel legalább 6 óra (maga a szabály még 1 óra). Az űrhajók rendszere tetszik ugyan, de kicsit Galaxis roncsderbi koppintás érzete volt mindannyiunknak. A technológia lapkák közül csak kevés ötletes van, a legtöbb csak az egyes űrhajó elemek kifejlesztése. A kevesebb néha több... (A többiek nagyon kritikusak voltak a játékkal szemben, szerintük a túl sok alkatrész lapka volt túlzás, és feleslegesen túlbonyolítottnak tartották az űrhajó 2 fázisban történő építését: először kifejleszteni, utána megépíteni.) A szerencsefaktor viszonylag nagy, jópár helyen megjelenik, nem csak a csata kockák miatt, szinte minden lapkát húzunk. Elég sok idő ki- ill. belpakolni. Nem nyelvfüggő, de nagyon tematikus. Főleg sci-fi fanoknak ajánlott.

Kiegyenlítettségről egyelőre nem sokat tudok mondani: a spéci fajoknál kérdéses lehet... A játék végén ötleteltünk, és többféle nyerő stratégia is felmerült bennünk, de a fegyverkezés valószínűleg elengedhetetlen.

Összességében szinte bármikor játszanám, a hossza ellenére is, de egy játék alapján nem került be a kedvenceim közé.

---

Aludtam rá egyet:
+1 pozitívum: a sok féle technika nem egymásra épül, ez szerintem nagyon változatossá teszi a játékot. Akár csúcstechnológiát is kifejleszthet valaki néhány körön belül (bár kicsit ráfizetéses).
+1 negatívum: nagyon nagy helyet foglal a játék! A játékostáblák nem A4-esek, hanem majdnem A3 méretűek + ugyanekkora a fő tábla is, az űrpálya pedig kiszámíthatatlan méretű. Mi 3 játékossal teljesen belaktuk a 120 x 150-es asztalt, 6 fővel szerintem gondban lennénk, pedig még a Railroad Tycoon és a WOTR is elfér az asztalon.

Elhangzott olyan vélemény az asztalnál, hogy a játék Galaxis Roncsderbi mellett Shipyardból és Starcraftból van összegyúrva, ez kb. annyira igaz szerintem, mint ahogy az Agricola a Bohnanzából és a Caylusból lett gyúrva: van benne zöldség, meg vannak akciók.
---
Helyesbítek: ez nem worker placement, mert nem közös akciók vannak, és egyik akció sem korlátos.
---
A táblák készülhettek volna valamivel keményebbre.
---
3 parti után: elég nagy hiba a csata résznél szerintem, hogy aki kamikaze módon beáldoz egy kis űrhajót, az is húzhat egy hírnévlapkát, pusztán azért, mert részt vett egy csatában. Így aki végig nem csatázott semmit, a végén (már úgyis mindegy alapon) gyorsan csatába küldi minden minden űrhajóját egyesével, és így egy csomó hírnév lapkát húzhat. Közel annyi pontot szerezhet így a legprimitívebb űrhajóival is akár, mint az aki végig űrhajókra gyúrt, és csatázott. A játék továbbra se kedvenc, de a műfajban még nem próbáltam jobbat, szerintem a Starcraftnál és a Twilight Imperiumnál is jobb!!

Eclipse is an excellently themed 4X structured game that uses moderate economy building and light combat to amazing effect. With so many unique races, variable galaxy topology,  random tech availability, and user driven ship design the game really is a crown pleaser as it gracefully scale from 3-6 players (9 with expansion). Eclipse is the best board game I have ever played. To give you an idea of the games we really enjoy, over the three years we have gotten great amount of play from 7 Wonders and 7 Wonders Duel, Coup, Avalon, Codenames, Star Realms, X-Wing TMG, Star Wars Imperial Assault, C&C Ancients, Race for the Galaxy, Lost Cities, Catan, Ticket to Ride, Small World, Sheriff of Nottingham, Patchwork, Jaipur, Blokus, Carcassone, Battleline, Forbidden Island and Desert, to name our most played games that we really enjoy. Eclipse, hands down, has passed them all as our family's favorite game. The strategy is deep and while most will argue if it is a wargame (only lightly) or a eurogame (moderately) the game is really a tactical diplomacy game which to many will appear odd on face value due to the limited overt diplomatic mechanisms. But the game is rich in concepts such as virtual fleets and the threat of weaker players to bomb planets of players with larger threatening fleets which requires a high degree of subtle negotiation to maximize your empire and direct attention elsewhere. The game is expertly designed and exceptionally balanced. Easily a "10" without the Rise of the Ancients expansion which, while in no way necessary, adds to an already exceptional game.

Played three or four times, and enjoyed it every time. Develop your space outposts, gather resources, and build spaceships to defeat and colonise your opponents.

The game takes some set-up, and maybe half a game to really get used to the rules and object of the game, but once it clicks you can easily get hooked. There are two levels of play, standard human races that are all the same to get used to the game, then a number of alien races that change your starting set-up and the things that you can do in small but significant ways. The quality of game pieces is very good, and you get a lot, which is good given the high price tag.

There are a few quibbles, but they're quite minor. It can be a bit easy, especially with four or fewer players, to intentionally avoid conflict with other players and stay in your own bit of space, developing your defences in case anyone comes to pick on you. The set up time is fairly long, as is the game, and whoever manages to get the high level cannons for their ships first seems to get quite an advantage, as you get a lot of victory points simply from destroying other ships. Still a very enjoyable game, but will take a whole evening or afternoon to get a game in.

RATING: 6
This game was okay -- it felt a lot like Through the Ages, but with an exploration component and a bit more interesting economic engine.  Like TtA, the combat system seemed too separated from the rest of the game, and didn't offer a path to victory on its own.  I find that I'm not as interested in games that end after a certain number of turns, either.  It just always feels like it ends before you can do what you want.  As such, I would definitely play it again, as it is so popular a game, but I probably won't go looking for a game of it on my own.

RATING: 10
I find this a compelling game, big enough to get the Master of Orion feel but short enough to leave you wanting more. The game feels slightly scripted, but the decisions still matter. It helps that the game moves from opening (scripted) to midgame (wild) quickly.

The expansion adds little complexity, but lots of chrome, and is great.

Excellent 4X space civ - area control - space conflict game. The rules are minimal but offer many strategies. A review of a lot of great ideas and balances, and some needed innovations. Great graphic design too.
Eclipse has almost none of the flaws of Twilight Imperium (duration, hard to remember technology tree, bad micromanagement) and the great innovation of ship fitting. However there is no need to sell your Twilight Imperium copy, as TI remains an epic game.

After some plays, my only complaint is that there is a chaotic battle going on in the last 2 rounds that seems repetitive and not "in accord with the game's philisophy".

Eclipse is a piece of design genius.
The way resources are generated, actions are drafted and everything is managed through the (most awesome ever designed) player mat is so brilliant one wonders why noone thought about it before!
There is also a very clever mechanic (Reputation) to handle turtling.
The box is full of components, and the quality of the production is (almost) top-notch, so nothing is lacking in this department.
The game has definitely a story arc, it is engaging and fun to play, and it is shorter than most civilization games.
So... why Eclipse is not in my top10?
Apart from the very minor nitpicks about luck, I guess I am not in love with the way the large part of the techs is dedicated to ships upgrading, leading to a game where military upgrade and fighting is a necessity.
Of course these may be the trademarks of the 4x genre... And so I wonder if I have a problem with the genre itself...

Initial Impression: An amazingly elegant system for a game with so much going on. Bookkeeping is almost non-existant. The game is fun and has just the right amount of randomness to prevent it from becoming a stale Euro. The different races allow for different playstyles with only minor tweaks to the base rules. My only gripes at this point are a lack of negotiation abilities and lack of rich theme. It seems as if the designer purposefully left the game generic.

10 Plays: This game still feels very fresh and more plays have really highlighed the great care that the designer put into balancing the different victory conditions. Many of our plays have been won by a small margin of just a few VPs, despite everyone choosing different goals. I've now added the Rise of the Ancients expansion into the mix, which brings with it some background and theme, along with more races.

Eclipse is indeed a good and decent game. But it isn't superior or very innovative. It takes the best of different games and mixes it into a new game. I never thought that Eclipse would be a 100% wargame. In fact this is what it is all about. Exploring and working out your army material. You build up in a clever way and that is a pro. On the other hand it can't be compared with strong eurogames which have a lot more tension in a much shorter time. So conclusion : a very good game, but I'd expected even more.

RATING: 8
Explore, colonize, research, design your own ships, and conquer. An amazing game, but for one flaw: luck of the draw. At the start of the game, you must explore in hopes of colonizing new planets to produce more; if you keep stumbling across new systems with enemies (and thereby not being bale to colonize until they're defeated), you can fall behind very quickly, as it's difficult to defeat these right off the bat.

I'mma hold off on my real rating until I get a game under my belt that involves only experienced players.  As of now, my first impression has been, "Oh my, what tedium.  Yaaaaawwwnnn."  A lot of that has to do with the game taking too.  Damn.  Long.  Plus some whiny and/or annoying opponents.  And did someone say "mega-luck factor?"  

* Oh, whom am I kidding?!  I probably won't play this again.  Too many other good games to play.  True, the "clearly broken" part of the "1" rating doesn't apply, but it's like that whale on the beach from _Reno 911! Miami_: big and bloated, fascinating to ogle for a while, and then 3-4 hours later, it all explodes, and you're covered in stinky, gooey whale guts.  (Then again, the "you won't catch me dead..." part may not apply, either, as someone might be compelled for some reason to put my corpse at a table where an Eclipse game is set out...mwahahaaaa.)

Too much randomness for my taste. In our last game, one player explored systems without having a single encounter on it, while the others had to gear up and fight the ancients to gain more resources. By round 4, the "run away winner" had maxed out the income track and sailed to victory without anyone having a proper chance. 
Also, choosing to pass to become start player without knowing which new research items will come up can also cripple more than help. Meh.

Well, chances are you've heard good things, and I've only got more good things to say.  The game is DYNAMIC and REACTIONARY.  You have to watch what your opponent does and react, continuously, right until the last turn.

Everything TI3 should have been, at a fraction of the time.

Unfortunately two things drag the rating down. First it is far too long from what I expected, Haven't finished a game in less than 4 hours with 3-4 players yet. Secondly, there are the "loss of fighting momentum" bug, i e fights tend to happen and then one of the sides have to lick the wounds and the next fight is 2-3 rounds later, which feels a bit disappointing.
But the best thing is the totally free ship design. That part is superior to any other game.

La partida se desarrolla en nueve rondas en las que tuvimos que explorar nuevas galaxias, colonizar planetas e investigar/desarrollar avances tecnológicos, todo esto sazonado con conflictos armados y políticos entre jugadores. A todo lo anterior, añadimos una misteriosa raza galáctica denominada Los Antiguos que funciona de manera autónoma.

Partida entretenida que duró más de 4 horas incluida explicación y que gustó a los presentes en general, aunque a unos más que a otros. El clamor popular concluyó que hay que jugarlo más veces para sacarle todo lo que puede dar de si y tener una valoración mas aproximada de las posibilidades reales que tiene el juego. Espero volverlo a jugarlo.

Holy cow, what a remarkable game.  A 4X-er (Explore, Expand, Exploit, Exterminate) in the same vein as Twilight Imperium, but plays FAST.  (Well, minus the set-up time; there are a lot of fiddly little bits to put in place before you can get going.)  With the elegant mechanics and emphasis on moving little blocks of wood around, it's fundamentally a Euro -- that lets you discover new planets, conduct orbital bombardment, and shoot freakin' ANTI-MATTER CANNONS at your opponents.  Fun, satisfying game; highly recommended.

Suffers from one of my pet peeves in a game, which is an overabundance of fiddly tokens, but otherwise Eclipse is a fun and involved space explore-and-conquer game that can be played in just a few hours. I suspect there may be fewer paths to victory than it first appears (you must fight to win, and you probably need missiles to win fights), and I feel like I have seen quite a bit of what it has to offer after just a few plays.

Very well designed 4X game. It's short which means it hits the table often. There is great variety with the different races, board set-up and available techs. And it really has so many strategies to explore. Each race has quite a few ways to victory. Choosing the right one comes down to recognizing the opportunities presented by the game and your fellow players. Furthermore it is a clean and easy to learn system. Explanation can be done for the biggest part by just starting to play. As for once the great majority of rules just make sense. Also it scales pretty well. I've played with between 2 and 5 players and enjoyed every one game. It's amazing to see that gameplay in a 2 player game differs not that much from that in a 5 player game. Lastly the only (small) negative remark are the components. While being OK the tiles do get worn pretty quickly. The rest of the components are just standard and functional.

There has been some discussion about the influence of luck. I don't think luck plays a big part in this game as for me it's all about risk management. Players who take too many risks tend to lose and then blame it on bad luck. I blame it on bad play.

Bought on february 16th 2013.

A superb game that matches a very clever resource management system with a 4x gameplay. One of my favourite games. I've played this with 11 different people and everybody loves it so far. My main problem is that I have yet to play it without someone new, which means always playing with Terrans and playtime being very long (typically one hour per player rather than the suggested 30 minutes per player). I am looking forward to playing this without having anyone new to the game involved.

Some pros:
- An overall great game that everybody who likes somewhat complex games enjoys.
- A great and intuitive resource management system
- While there is definitely luck involved with this game (which exlopartion hexes do you draw, which reputation tiles do you draw, do you have good dice rolls), I've found that in 4 out of the 5 games I've played, the player who made the best decisions also won the game.

Some cons:
- Somewhat complex.
- Rather long.
- Plasma missiles, while not game breaking or particularly overpowered, tend to make the game revolve around them when they show up. I feel that a power requirement of 1 would be a good house rule.

This game has a mis-leading theme - IMO. The game is actually about building your race, the tech tree and the planets you conquer (i.e. are lucky to find).

RATING: 9
An excellent space-faring game with compelling variability between races. It has everything you'd want out of a space 4X, and upgrading your ships is a really fun mechanic. My only complaint is that the diplomacy is handled in a very weak way and the benefits to diplomacy (and drawback to betrayal) are barely there. This is because the diplomatic connections themselves are more or less just symbolic.

I still love the game though, and I REALLY enjoy that when the game ends you'll have an overarching story about the growth of your galactic civilization.

After six times playing this game, my game group feels pretty comfortable with it. This is a long game, usually lasting about three hours per session, but it's consistently engaging. Rule checks occur often when beginning the game, but after awhile, it becomes second nature. My recommendation is playing it twice within a week to really get the swing of the rules.

RATING: 6
Pro's:

1) The empire management aspect is incredibly intuitive.
2) Aesthetics and art style suits the genre with the iconography being very well designed.
3) The cold war style arms race of technology and ship upgrading while trying to counter what your opponent is doing. Many people complain that plasma missiles or whatever are overpowered, I have found that NOT to be the case in my games as long as I kept up the arms race.

Con's:

1) Randomness of tile drawing can make it feel like your empire stagnates at turn one. It's like you instantly lost the game.
2) Battles can feel like a long drawn out messy slog.
3) Game will generally end just as things are about to ramp up. Kind of like listening to a song remixed by an idiot who cuts out the bit that everyone likes.
4) Setup time is a pain.
5) The bookkeeping/empire management part of this game is definitely well done from an intuitive point of view, but it slows the game down a lot and ends up being kind of disconnected from the 4X elements.

I found this game real easy to understand and teach. This game feels pretty intuitive once you start to play despite the massive amounts of tokens and cubes. And being able to discover a new unique galaxy every game is really cool as well as being able to adjust your strategy, from the war-hungry powerhouse to hippy resource farmer depending on what's around you.

But beyond that this game just left me thinking, "Meh".  I won games by just focusing on one or two stats for my ships which made it almost feel like cheating. And it really overstayed it's welcome for me, I was bored in the first hour of my last game and it lasted 4-5ish.

And I just had this weird air of non-excitement throughout all my plays that I had never experienced before the whole way through. Even as I found a bunch of resources in some far off corner of the galaxy or plopped like 8 units in front of an impending invasion point. Maybe the theme just isn't for me somehow..? But I love other space themed games so I don't get it

RATING: 10
I really prefer Eclipse in the 3-4 player range. Five and six player games result in too much down time. My favorite thing about the game is the customization of the ship blueprints.

Update: After more plays, five and six player games flow just fine. It's merely a question of keeping the turns moving and making sure everyone knows whose turn it is. This game keeps getting better with each play.

RATING: 5
OK, so I played it. I am no fan of space opera but it is an OK game.

On the downside, the first time you play it goes oooooooonnnnnnn! 6 new players and it took us 6 hours. SIX HOURS.

And, of course, with random territory and dice rolling, there is going to be luck involved and 3 of the six were clear they were not going to win within the first two hours. At least in Talisman you have a chance of a comeback win!

I am rating it a 5 because it isn't badly designed and I guess the experience would be more tolerable with 4 players who had played before, but it isn't my type of game and I am probably not going to play it again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
When I heard other players praise Eclipse as a well-done crossover - actually they said «hybrid», as it’s used to call them today - between a thematic and euro game, I was doubtful: since they’re mainly eurogamers, I expected Eclipse to be your typical and boring resource-gathering cube-pusher with just a pinch more of theme than usual, still enough to have them scream how thematic the game feels.

Yet, as I was lured into playing it at last, I had to change my mind quickly: Eclipse is an excellent game in which some thematic and euro elements coexist, hence appealing to both kinds of gamers. If only, it feels like the euro side is a bit prevalent since the game’s primary focus is on the resource-gathering and managing: still, this isn’t brought too far since rarely the game prevents a player from doing what he’s got in his mind.

Looks like that with Eclipse we have found a common ground to play on. (August 2012)

[b]Update I[/b] - Looks like I was wrong: although Eclipse has some theme - surely more than its likes usually have - it’s still heavily euro in its core. As a matter of fact, the more I’ve played it over the good last year the less I’ve liked it: some of its rules simply don’t make sense and seem to only be there to grind you down as in the end all your attention is aimed at optimizing your resource management with little left for doing anything else.

I still play it (although not gladly: it’s way too long and cumbersome for the fun it gives me) but I can’t consider it worthy of a high rating anymore: thus, in January 2014 I lowered it from 8 to 6. 

[b]Update II[/b] - It’s getting worse and worse: at the moment (May 2014) what’s preventing Eclipse from getting an even lower rating than 6 is, it has starships. And I love big starships.

One of the best board games out there.  Excellent game and really fulfills a number of desires for us. It's space opera/empire building, exploration and domination, worker placement/resource management, a little diplomacy, and (one of the most important for me) a tile laying game board. You can easily go offensive or defensive fairly well and there are a number of paths to victory.

VERY re-playable and relatively quick given everything going on.  If you like the idea of Twilight Imperium but don't like the idea of spending 12 hours playing it, I think this is a good option.

This game works fairly well with any number of players.  Two player games play out just as fun as six player games, you merely have to change your strategies up a bit in some peoples cases.

The one drawback... setup and game pieces during game play. This game is messy used strictly out of the box with everything out and ready to go. In my opinion you will almost surely want some kind of after-market storage organization option and, ideally, during game play organizational aids to help keep things easily at hand but without getting moved or knocked over during game play.

This tray is an absolute must in my opinion: http://www.boardgameinnovation.com/eclipse-tray-expanded/

If you find you like this game and want an even more extreme variation of it, check out Twilight Imperium.

I give it a 7.5 on my first play.  I imagine this will move up once I play it again.  Great game of resourse management and the theme, even though I'm not a sci-fi person, was engaging and fun.  I like that it isn't a huge battle game (but with some involved) as there is more to do than that.  I also found that it wasn't all that difficult to get into.  After getting a game under my belt (all of us) I think it's easier to teach someone than to learn from the book.  So, yeah, I like this.  The resources are tight and throughout the game you really have to manage so you can keep up with the Joneses.  

I personally cannot see playing this game with more than four.  It would take too long for me.

This game is a rollercoaster for me. Some games were so good I would give this game a 9, and some were a disaster and I would give it a 6. At the end, I think 7 is a fair rank. I think game is prone to AP, and has 2 many luck factor mechanics, which, for an eurogame this is, is not 2 welcome. But there is so much inovative stuff here, I would recommend people to try it out. And yeah, you need a big ass table.

Loved this game at first, but after several plays, there's an obvious design flaw.  The Plasma Missiles (PM) dominate the game.  Once they come onto the tech board, the game changes to be the first to grab them.  If you miss out you have to either coerce your fellow players to gang up or go defensive for the rest of the game.

A long economic and 4x game set in space. Explore, expand, build, and fight with other players. Initially you focus on exploring and avoiding conflict, but pretty quickly it gets crowded and you start to push against your neighbors. 

Expansions add alliances to allow players to really team up and share victories.

An awesome game. At heart it's still a Euro, but without all the boring "gather wood, build mill, produce flour, sell at market, get VP" generic pasted-on theme stuff. Player interaction through direct conflict with a Euro-style economic system and variable player powers? Won't get much better than this!

Very good streamlined 4x experience. Very fun rigging your fleets to either be hard to take down or pack a punch with upgrades. 6 player game can be long with some down time. Some players can get lucky with drawing good planets in their sector, but that's part of the game. Good dice rolls can also be a large factor, but this game is more about having fun than intense deep strategy.

I'm a big fan of this one. It's everything I like about Twilight Imperium in less time, and way more balanced out of the gate. The only minor issue I have with it is that once two factions have researched all the technologies, it tends to come down to a dice-off as to who wins combats.

RATING: 7.5
Eclipse has good ideas but seen before in other eurogames, the battles add some ameritrash feel that creates a good mixture but even though on the other hand it's an overrated game, nothing really amazing or revolutionary. 

Other issue is that it lasts too long with four or more players.

This game really sings. It poetically integrates civ building, tactical fighting and an economic engine. So much has been said that there is nothing really to do except engage its criticisms. Luck of the tile draw plays a role; there is no way around that. Plasma missiles are very, very strong. One has to accept that Eclipse is also a game of diplomacy, though, and that the players have to react to luck which swings a player to an early lead or to the decision of a player to pick up plasma missiles. If players don't embrace the social game, then Eclipse is a game of math -- very clever, balanced, elegant math, but with that limitation nonetheless. My group loves table-talk which is why Eclipse is a firm "ten;" it is a perfect platform for a social game while still having a sophisticated engine humming along underneath. If I had one wish it would have been for the theme and backstory to have been a little more developed and immersive, but I can't quibble with a masterpiece like this.

Update: I dropped it to a 9 just because the theme isn't quite as rich as I'd like. We talk less now about the "narrative" of the game afterward than the "sequence" of the game. It's engrossing to be sure without being captivating. That said, I'm quibbling. It has a terrific engine and produces a terrific amount of fun interaction; I doubt it will slip below this rank for me.

Update: Yeah, I was wrong I have it as a 7 now. With a game this long and with this many decision points, I just need a more immersive theme to hold it all together. I really admire the combination of mechanics, but I have to acknowledge that I will reach for other games that tell me more of a story before I will reach for Eclipse again. I'm not trading it away but it's not at the front of the library anymore.

Behold the power of the hype machine.  You've all been duped.  This is a game made for Euro fans who want to hang with the AT crowd but are too afraid to leave their spreadsheets behind to do so.  One brilliant mechanic (the ship design) a midst a plethora of mediocre ones (and a few horrifically bad ones as well, such as the exploration and the random VP pull in battles).  TI3 killer it is NOT.

사실 우주테마는 그다지 끌리는 장르가 아니었고 문명이나 스루를 먼저 했었기 때문에 비슷한 게임이지 않을까 했지만 전혀 색다른 느낌을 주었다. 아마 그것은 자신만의 함대건설이 주는 독특한 재미가 있기 떄문일듯.

더군다나 전투가 큰 비중을 차지하면서도 다른 게임과 달리 군사력 절대 강국 = 승리 공식은 이클립스에서는 거의 먹히지 않는다는 면도 굉장히 신선하게 다가왔다. 다만 종족별 밸런스 문제라던가, 역전이 어렵다는 점, 넓은 자리 차지, 플레이 시간의 압박등이 있지만 그럼에도 불구하고 역시 2012년 가장 신선한 충격으로 다가온 게임임에는 분명한듯.

I love being a space accountant. In fact, I love everything about this game EXCEPT for the excruciatingly terrible combat.

Which should be fine. Chuck some dice. Get it done. Whatever. But the combat in this game doesn't even have the decency to stay put in its own phase. It reaches its shitty little tendrils out into the arms race(which should be awesome - it should be so awesome), and before you know it, it's dragged everything down a screaming sinkhole of suck.

Was introduced to this by a friend and instantly enjoyed it.

Initially it can seem a bit formulaic, turtle, build then rush - but after a play group has got to grips with the game the early game violence begins.

Rules are simple yet deep, balance is mostly good but rare techs can swing it in smaller games. Random element can be a bit of a pain, but as with most games a good strategy will largely mitigate this.

Can't see me getting bored with this any time soon, and has actually become a bit obsessive!

I'm also looking for the "perfect" 4X space game. I've tried Twilight Imperium (II & III), Galactic Emperor, Merchants of Venus, Terra Prime, 1000 AD etc, etc. I really like TI-III but it is a bit too long and I have trouble rounding up willing players. Galactic Emperor was close but fell a little short, but this latest entry seems to have caught fire making it a must buy for me. Fingers crossed...
++++++
First glance looks good and the read-through encouraging so my place holder rating is a little higher than usual for this stage. Stay tuned...
++++++
Alright, two plays in (3&4 player) and wow! The game is every bit what I had hoped and more. Firstly, I had misgivings about the playing time even with only three or four players as I have seen optimistic statements about this sort of thing proved wrong more often than not. Even with a game limit of nine turns each comprised of several rounds of player actions, this game moved briskly even after just a short introduction and all of us total novices to the game (other than what we'd gleaned on-line). As a variation on the Civ model, all of the actions were quite intuitive once the details were outlined and each action was resolved quickly. Our first game lasted just about 2 1/2 hours.

The game gets obvious comparisons to TI-III and that's fair but a closer comparison might be between this and Galactic Emperor (the two games even share the same figs). The two games play out in about the same time and both have been declared forms of TI - Lite; but, in Eclipse, there are no roles and a different mechanic determines turn order. The tech system is much more detailed, as is the combat system, and the way the universe unfolds with the worm-hole system of movement is very clever. The book-keeping system (reminiscent of Through the Ages or Age of Renaissance) is absolutely brilliant. As much as I liked Galactic Emperor, Eclipse out-points it pretty well across the board.

The only observation we had after the two games was that the supply of "outer" hexes seemed unnecessarily limited, but I suspect this was deliberate to encourage player "interaction." Our first game was with all Terran factions (as recommended), the second was with the "alien" counterparts and both were fascinating. All of us were keen to play again with mixtures of both or some kind of player draft for starting races. When extended postmortems dominate the conversation after a game ("coulda/woulda/shoulda") you know you're on to something.

Much has been written about the level of "chaos" (read luck) present in the game and I can attest to the sense of frustration at turning over hex after hex of crap. But, like Conquest of Paradise (another fair comparison), it is what it is and can be part of the charm of the game for those not offended by it. Technology development can also seem like a crap shoot, but you cheerfully hope for the best and try to make the best of what is made available to you. Combat involving dice always invites discussion but the tech system at least gives players a chance at mitigation, and the whole combat phase is tightly designed, intuitive and exciting without being either too simple or too complex. None of this puts us off and the good news is that with the relatively short playing time for a space opera epic, you won't suffer long as the victim of bad luck and there's always next time!

Bottom line is that we all agreed that this is one of the better games we have come across in some time - perhaps the best. We are not always easy to please but this game just had us begging for more!

A piece of icing on the cake came with the info that the Interactivity (FLGS here in Victoria) crowd had a hand in the design/play-testing during Touko's stay here at some point during the development. This game has no rough edges to speak of and is lovingly crafted and presented. It fully deserves to be where it is on the Geek chart and it could well end up as number one. Unfortunately (and my only criticism), the game is neither uniformly distributed nor widely available here in North America. Aside from that - well done! My first ever Ten!

RATING: 6
Wasn't quite as wow'd as I was expecting given all the great things everyone had been saying about this.

I need to play it again, preferably with players who know the game (and don't suffer AP).

So, comments to be taken with a liberal pinch of salt, my one play could be very unrepresentative of a typical game.

Good stuff: Map, variable, simple (ish), various routes to victory, aliens to mash.

Not so good stuff: tile map without a map, so not at all obvious where tiles go if the map gets spread out and messy. Tiles you find early seem pretty crucial, get naff ones and you fall behind.

Downtime, should be minimised as it's 1 do one thing, you do 1 thing, but even with 4 I felt there was quite a bit of waiting around (5 or 6 would be worse).

Problems of 2 people piling on a 3rd, or 2 go to war and rest mop up ... but that's a problem with any muliplayer conflict game.

Combat system, didn't enjoy chucking dice much

Tech system - just felt frustrating, you can't research what isn't there, and passing early just to get the jump in first has no guarantee what you want will appear. But it works.

Need to play it with the aliens to see what difference they make.

** Update, played again, Missiles seem rather good (perhaps too good?), and with anyone suffering AP this drags in the mid/late game.

Still keen to play again, I suspect rating will rise with more plays ...

*** Update, happy to play the App, face to face less so. Can suffer downtime, especially with higher player numbers, but the main things that bug me is the random draw of vp tokens, random draw of tech and the widely differing explore tiles - which shouldn't matter as I like ameritrash, but this feels rather Euro so it does. Overall not really the 4x I am looking for. Saying that much rather play this than scythe!

Incredible game; one of the only games in which I can play for 6 hours and feel like only 2 have gone by. Definitely a time sink, which is certainly a deterrent for some, but a worthy time sink if you are willing to put it on the table.  Many call this TI3: lite. It is not, and never will be, because this is more of a "space banking" economic game, not a space opera conflict game. I feel like many who dislike this game attempt to compare the two, and I feel like (while both are 4x games) there is a space for both in any collection that wants them and they are on opposite ends of the Euro/American style spectrum. My #3 game overall.

I've played this enough to say it's a very good take on the Master of Orion 4X formula.  Takes about 2-3 hours, so it's over relatively quickly if you screw up, but there's usually one or two battles in the middle that will put you in or take you out of contention.

Also, while I really enjoy it, it's a game I cannot figure out how to win.  Just too many balls to juggle, and the game doesn't seem to reward specialization in any one thing.

The battle system is black or white! Seems unbalanced; so get the best Computer +3, the best 9er supply and some dreadnoughts with 2 missle turrets and you will get what you want. Need a 2nd play to proof this gaming style. Best game-mechanic is the action taking vs. increasing cost mechanic. And the absence of real Diplomacy seems to be ideal for 3 to 4 players. My old and modified TI2 wins the death match vs Eclipse in the category -playing time- and fun. And shit can happen in the first 2 rounds, if you explore three or four times an alien hex. Last: 8 rounds would be better than 9 for finish, because the 2 or 3 loosers of a 4 to 6 player game suffered enough.

This game will initially remind people of TI- they are both space empire themed games with hexes, but they play completely differently.  TI is much more epic and flavorful and themey.  Very AT.  Eclipse is basically a euro with some space battles and dice thrown in.  It combines many things: economic euro, light war, a sprinkling of AT, a sci-fi theme, dice, etc. seamlessly into tight well-oiled machine of a game.  Very cool.  Rules are pretty simple (although it will initially appear fairly complex), still, first few plays were a little long.  Combat can be a little monotonous with no decisions (except to retreat or not) and many die rolls trying to get 6's.  Initial turns and luck exploring in the first few turns can also have a pretty big impact on the game.  These are minor complaints though.  Great game overall.

An excellent 4X game. You have to carefully judge your actions, because you only get so many before you start facing bankruptcy. There is also technological development, and even ship design. The design is a really interesting study in how to use play aids and a relatively small number of components to track a large amount of information.

I do think Plasma Missiles are somewhat overpowered in the base game, although they aren't unbeatable.

I'm not a huge fan of the space 4x genre but I was pretty impressed with this game. The usual downfall for games like this is that the they try to jam too much into the game, creating bloated monstrosities like Twilight Imperium. Eclipse, however, really sticks to the basics of the genre and along with some clever mechanics makes the game relatively fast and painless. At one point I brought up the idea of expansions with alien races and the owner of the game pointed out that the flip side of the player boards  did indeed have alien races with their own unique starting setup. It's a very impressive package and I'm willing to play again.

This is pretty much everything I love in a game.

Es un juego de civilizaciones y desarrollo espacial. Los jugadores están a cargo de una raza. Se juegan en 9 rondas. En cada ronda hay cuatro fases. Las fases de acciones permiten explorar nuevos sistemas, mover influencia de unos a otros, investigar en nuevas tecnologías, mejorar las naves, construir o mover. Después hay una fase de mantenimiento, y otra de limpieza. La mayor parte de interacción la realizas con los vecinos. Cada acción que realices te supondrá mayores costes en la fase de mantenimiento. Cuando colonizas un planeta, vas obteniendo recursos que te permitirán hacer otras cosas. Hay tres parámetros esenciales: dinero, materiales y ciencia.

Es un juego muy bueno y muy entretenido, pero más orientado para jugones. Los no jugones se pueden saturar un poco. Es muy de calcular que puedes hacer. Tiene un puntito de azar (cuando exploras, las losetas te vienen al azar.. en los combates, hay dados), pero no es, ni con mucho, determinante.

Totalmente recomendable. Estoy deseando jugarlo de nuevo. Lo he probado a 6. Lo recomiendan al menos a 4. Es algo largo, eso sí.

Great brain-burning game with a nice healthy amount of conflict, unlike most euros that I like. My main complaint would be the random space tiles did seem to have a little too much impact (positive or negative swing depending on how lucky you got when you drew) to the game.

A wonderful game: great components, great art, strong theme and clever mechanics. For me the best 4x game. You can really play your own style...try to play aggressive and attack everyone or stay in an isolated part of the galaxy, fight the non player species and build up your empire. 
For me the best part is the fact that the bigger you get, the harder it becomes to control your empire and the less actions you can do. This is different to most 4x games where you have this runaway effect: growth makes you stronger, allows you to expand faster, which makes you even more stronger and so on. If you had a bad start, you´re often screwed. Here it´s completely different: If you´re small, you might not have that much power, but you can do many actions to grow. The bigger you get though, the more limited your actions are so you really have to find a good balance here. 
With the expansions you have amazing replayability: lots of different races, tons of tiles for your galaxy, lots of technologies, your own ship construction...just amazing!

Very tight Space 4x game.  I like how the technology works in the game, and that you're not limited by needing other technologies first. The Ship Upgrades played well, and the combat system of increasing or decreasing dice rolls to get a 6 works well too. Players boards are well organized.  I like how the exploration is unknown ahead of time (unlike TI3). Not sure which one I like more at this time.

1 game played

Cons: 
-Game ending mechanic ruins what may have been a near perfect game.  How a person plays to win/dominate is very different than playing to be in a lead at the end of turn 9, which is what this game essentially is.  
-Given the 9 turn limitation, a player that starts slow or has a run of bad luck during the first half of the game has a very limited probability of staging an epic comeback.  

Pros: 
-Very good game.  Tech tree and upgrade mechanic is near flawless.  Resource management system is also as impressive.

I had high expectations when I tried Eclipse, but unfortunately the experience was quite underwhelming: I was expecting a master piece and found just a nice game instead. Since none of my gaming buddies were particularly impressed either, I doubt I will get more plays, which is fine by me anyway.

If you liked Master of Orion you will definitely like this game. I've played the prototype now twice and it is really solid. Definitely one of the best heavier galactic games I've played and the game isn't even ready yet.

Edit:

I've now played the printed version of the game and I'm still as impressed as I was when I first laid my eyes on the game. Eclipse is a embodiment of euro mechanics, theme and dice rolling a la wargames. It's compact, fluent, gorgeous and epic and takes 30 minutes per player as promised. Only con I can think of the game is that I don't at the moment have enough time to play games and thus it's not going to hit the table often enough (and that they don't yet provide a collectors edition of the game).

Brilliant multiplayer combat game. This is my go to game if ever I want an evening of wargaming with 5 or 6 players. The game flows fast, great components, rich space theme and excellent systems.

RATING: 6
A game of economy and optimization and confrontation. There are so many little aspects to explore, which provides a lot of replay value. 

Luck plays a big role in this game: Tile drawing, dice in combat, drawing reputation tiles after combat and, maybe most importantly, grabbing the powerful technologies when they come up (plasma missiles dominate battles, monoliths open up a whole new strategy for players with a lot of materials.) There is so much luck  that it will often even out, but if you're unlucky early and fall behind you can be stuck in a long game with no chance to recover.

In the games we played so far, everybody was concentrating on themselves, and there were barely any negotiations. If the victory points would be open information or it would be by other means more clear who was leading, diplomacy could play a bigger role, with weak players ganging up on the stronger players.

After a few more games, I have found that too often a player gets punished by bad luck, especially during exploration, or getting the righ tech. The game is much more about optimization than about combat, and when you're behind there really isn't much that you can do.

Finally got this one to the table. I thoroughly enjoyed it, even though I had a tough time competing with the other alien races (I was the space ghosts, and felt that they were a bit tricky to get bonus VPs with). Even so, this game was great as an economic simulator in space, and was a fun play.

Loved my first play if this (even though I was murdered horrifically!).

Second play through was just as much fun. The alien races added a fair bit to the game. 

Every play of this game is better than the last. Still not won, but I really don't care. I must look at grabbing the expansion for this, even if just to show support to the designer!

Finally won a couple and still loving it. Expansion is certainly worth getting too.

One play so far, will update this rating going forward...

This game has the distinction of being my 1000th BGG game rating (dec 2011).  Before I accept my award, I'd like to thank my fans, my publicist, and most of all, God.  But enough about me.  We have a game here to rate.  So, let's get started.   

Cue music.  Black background.  Somber voice.

Peace thrived.  The galaxy was still.  Then, it turned into a flaming ball of PLASMA HELL. WAVE AFTER WAVE OF PURE MISSILE ANNIHILATION.

Then Steve realized that his ship had missiles but no gun, and it was promptly blown into a trillion pieces of space dust -- the atoms of his body ionizing and ripping through space time....

So, there you have it.  A boy's sad tale of galactic destruction.

As for the game, ask me again in the morning.  Right now I'm trying to remove the daggers from my back and the missile stains from my pants...

Note to add:  Unfortunately, plasma missiles sort of ruin the game.  Hoping that some sort of house rule can fix that.

Awesome Euro-Ameritrash concoction that works on practically every level: theme, design, mechanics, and player interaction. And it's incredibly fun! And it's set in space! What more could you want?

The player board's cube=income and action=cost setup is absolutely brilliant, and is easy both to implement and to understand. Although the tech tree is a little intimidating at first, the techs become easier to remember after a couple of plays. (What is with those ridiculous plasma missiles, though? Seriously overpowered, IMHO.)

Great game, love the interation, love the pace, love the look.  You really need to get prepared for the endgame though, as there's a big bang that happens that can really swing things around.  Unfortunately, there appears to be only one way to get ready for that big bang, and it's the same way everyone else is doing.  That may end up being what will drag this game down eventually for me, the lack of divergent successful strategies.  If it turns out I'm wrong and this is just all about tactics, then I'm perfectly willing to keep it right where it is, because I enjoy that as well.

The action point and economic system is brilliant, and I love the ship upgrades and combat. A bit heavy on the luck: you can get shafted by tile draws, and sometimes that technology tile you desperately need never shows up. The hard timer on the game end means it tends to devolve into a big brawl or point grab on the final turn with no care for defending your territory or future economy.

UPDATE: Every game I play of this is oddly passionless and Euro-ey, but I still like it.  Still, why does it garner such great reviews?  Is it because it comes across as conflict-almost?

I like it. Quite a bit. One aspect of the game which gives a warm fuzzy for me, is the ability to teach the game again after only one play. For the amount of 'stuff' going on (exploration, tech tree, a bit of resource management, multiple actions...) this game is incredibly intuitive. There are some games I love, but will rarely get to the table because of the complexity of the game play, needing to review the rule book each time. This is not one of those.

Kein TI3 Killer
Interessante und gut umgesetzte Neuerungen wie den Blueprints und den modularen Schiffsaufbau. 
1. Spiel: Bisher nur zu dritt, daher ohne Diplomatie gespielt
2. Spiel: 2 Spieler. Extrem Glückslastig. Wer gute Systeme zieht ist nach 2 Runden praktisch nicht mehr einzuholen. Trotzdem gut zu 2.
3.,4. Spiel: Der Eindruck das das Spiel mit dem ziehen guter Systeme steht und fällt hat sich bestätigt. Nach wie vor ein gutes seichtes Spiel was schnell erklärt und gespielt ist. 
5. Spiel: 8.7 -> 8  Die zufällige Galaxis , und die Art der Kämpfe können dafür sorgen, daß Spieler einfach nur zuschauen, anstatt aktiv ins Spiel eingreifen zu können. TI3 ist da deutlich planbarer.

Nach Zahlreichen ipad Runden: 8->6.5 zu zufällig. Die Systemteile sind ein Witz und absolut nicht einschätzbar. Die Kämpfe laufen immer auf massenhaft Raketen + Zielcomputer gegen -2 Schilde hinaus. Danke, dann lieber Exodus, Space Empires oder natürlich TI3

Now a number of plays in, this is a fun game. I can't complain too much about any 3-4 hour game I've played 5 times. Still, I don't know how much there really is here. It's still about getting a big economy and bashing your neighbors with it, and people who get luck with good exploration draws are in good shape, while players who draw poorly are screwed. What can you do, I guess. There is enough nuance to the game, and building the ships is fun enough, and the alien races are different enough, that I think it'll have decent (but not great) staying power. But it'll need good expansions, I expect, to stay alive - more alien races, more space hexagons, more tech and artifacts.
---
3 plays, I think I basically get the game now. It's fun. It has enough chrome and chaos to mask what it basically is (a king-of-the-hill, whack-your-neighbor game), but the chromey stuff still plays cleanly and gives the game nice texture and flavor and in the end, does successfully smooth over and mask the big underlying problems of the genre. I think there is enough here that fans of euros and fans of this genre (Titan, Dune, Britannia, etc.) who haven't had anything really good in a very long time will find something to like here. It's not anything like as good as Titan or Dune, but it is a heck of a lot shorter and maybe more playable. On the other hand, I suspect the replay value will be pretty limited barring a good expansion - I suspect a lot of the fun here is in exploring the game space.

Two balance issues: in my experience, the game is substantially better with 4 than with 6 (3 is probably fine too, while 5 might be awkward due to the asymmetry). The pacing is better with 4, and the onset of conflict is closer to the end, which is better given the lack of any real incremental scoring. With 6, space will run out and conflict will have to start by turn 4 or 5 and losers in those first battles can be screwed and stuck idling for an hour or two. Also, with 4 you are less likely to be hosed by poor tile draws.

I'm also starting to come around to the idea that missiles may need to be tamped back a bit, or a better defense added. A dreadnaught loaded with missiles and +3 computer is not very hard to build and can be pretty devastating. 
---
Been enjoying this. I expect it will play out before too long - it doesn't have a ton of range - but the experience is generally positive, which is saying a lot for this particular genre which I don't generally like (I wouldn't touch TI3 with a barge pole). Do try to keep the player count down though.
---
First impressions are really positive. Lots of good stuff, but clean-playing, with systems that interact well, and decent balance between offense and defense. Plays in a sensible amount of time (although I probably wouldn't want to play with the full compliment of 6 - 4 is probably the sweet spot for a bunch of reasons). I hold out hope that this will finally be a game to deliver on this theme.

Phenomenal game.  I waited a long time for this, and was not disappointed when it arrived.  It is a great game, with a lot to recommend it.  Gameplay is very smooth, with great civilization development, and lots of choices for expansion without seeming overwhelming.

The fiddly bits are plentiful, but once you see what they do, you can't imagine a more simple system to manage your game.  Resource management is painless, and decisions of how much you can do is easily measured by looking at your player board.

You owe it to yourself to play this game.

This game is chock full of elegant mechanics and helpful play aids. The components are smartly crafted for ease of play. By the end of the game all the various mechanics -- which may appear a bit daunting at first -- were second-nature to us.

Can't wait to play this one again and try out some different strategies.

A favorite of my lady friend and I. We've enjoyed playing this with 2 and 3 players. With all the different factions there is great variety in play, and the RoTA expansion only adds to this.

It usually feels that the game ends just as our empires are hitting their stride.

Tentative rating based on 1 play with 5 players, without alien powers:

Our first play took much, MUCH longer than I would have liked (around 6 hours). I'm sure subsequent plays would be faster, but I can't see this trimming down to the 2 hours I'd like it to be.

As far as the gameplay goes, what you've got here is a pretty straightforward 4X game fueled by a tight, though not particularly original, Euro-style resource game. The two blend together seamlessly. Is it mechanically superior to other 4X-meets-Euro blends (e.g., Twilight Imperium, Galactic Emperor)? I'm not sure I've played any enough for my opinion to be worth anything, but from my limited perspective: not really. No worse, though, certainly. After all, the economic game IS full of near-constant tense decisions, though for my money they are sometimes mired by too many layers of complexity and bookkeeping.

Once again, my main beefs with these kinds of games are present in full force: it's too long, there's too much downtime, and it's all too easy for 1-2 players to get locked out from even being competitive early on and having to sit there through the rest of it. Sure, they COULD get eliminated, but when everyone is pretty busy ganging up on the leader until the final turn when they start jumping on those in last to score some easy points, it seems fairly unlikely.

Let's work our way backwards, shall we?

Third: Players getting locked out of the win. There's a few reasons for this, but one thing that stood out to me is the VAST difference in exploration tiles. Some rewards are much, MUCH more powerful than others and if one player happens to luck into a bunch of them (and another "lucks" into none), it gives them a pretty hefty advantage over everyone else. Perhaps not insurmountably so, but if you luck into getting powerful ships early, then clean the floor with people in combat before anyone else is ready, thus scoring all the choicest VPs for yourself...

Second: Downtime! Granted much of this for us was unfamiliarity with the game, but part of this is due to the weird blend of mechanics, presentation, and components that is the tech tiles. Because new ones pop up each turn, you pretty much always want to have them in view. But the galaxy is what really needs to be in the center of the table, so you get this weird thing where people are constantly getting up from their seats, going over to the tech board, and staring at it. Mostly we were pretty good about doing this NOT on our turns, but I still think it contributes not inconsiderably to the overall downtime. The other big downtime factor (apart from the plain-ol' AP the game so easily lends itself to) is in combat. It can be fun to watch battles that you're not participating in if they're for the greater good of the table, but more often than not it just leads to sitting around twiddling your thumbs.

First: Length. I'm not one for long games in the first place, but due to the two issues above the length feels pretty painful. The beginning and endgame are pretty exciting, but unless you're primed for the lead the entire middle can be a excruciatingly slow.

The stuff I like about the game that actually feels unique to the game - the way alliances are part of the game mechanics (even if it feels odd that you can't move through enemy territory without declaring war), the hidden vs. known victory points, and the choice between those VPs and alliances, all feel kind of moot when compared with the above.

I'm certainly not against playing again now that we've got a full game under our belts, and have the alien powers left to try, but I can't say I'm exactly chomping at the bit to do so.

Tough to rate. I liked the game. But it runs long and there is no way I would ever want to play the game more than 2 or 3 times. The pacing is good and the game has a nice narrative arc, but in the end it's an efficiency game - the kind with limited options but tons of chrome with the technologies. I'm just not sure the exercise merits 4 hours. 

It's basically trying to get good tile draws, the right techs to come out based on what you are doing and where you are in the turn order and then racing for the best missiles and the +3 attack. That's what you are doing for 4 hours. It's good but the end all be all? Meh.

I really enjoy this game. It's a shame that my gaming group doesn't share the same sentiment. The amount of time it takes to play seemed to really turn everyone off during each play through. 

The only aspect of the game that I don't really enjoy is the battling. It feels very anticlimactic to me. I also don't like the randomness that's associated with drawing the victory point tiles. I think a fixed set of points for each outcome would be better.

This is one of the better games out there! Normally I don't like ameritrash, but this mix of ameritrash and eurogame is quite successful I think.

I'm not really sure what it is that makes me feel this way, but in general I seem to enjoy civilization games, and I'm a sucker for tech trees! It's also refreshing (for me as a eurogamer at least) to have some combat, and the negotiation, though not a huge part of the game, is nice.

However, there are a few downsides which has to do with the amount of luck involved in this game... People who know my tastes in board games know I despise luck if it directly causes a winner, especially if it's in longer games like this one.

There is luck involved in the exploring - sure, you can discard your tile, but I don't really think that is a good idea, and it will still cost you a turn and is therefore inefficient. Luck is involved in the dice combats - you can win if you keep rolling high numbers and your enemies low (though it's mitigated by computers/shields, but still). Also, to a lesser extent, there is randomness in which tech tiles become available each round - you can have a strategy and hexes that "need" specific techs, but they might never show up. Finally, there is luck involved in the reputation tiles you draw - they can cause huge point swings.

There are a few other aspects as well such as the ancient technologies, but those 3 can actually cause you to win a game even though you, objectively, haven't been the best player and vice versa... Especially the reputation tiles! I won a game with 2 points once, only because I got lucky in the last round and pulled some much higher reputation tiles than the person who finished 2nd!

Nevertheless, this is a great game because it, to me, comes close to what I would describe as an "epic space game". Sure, TI3 might be more epic, but Eclipse "only" takes ~3 hours with 4 players, which I think is reasonable.

The components and graphics are great. The rules aren't that difficult to understand as you can only do 6 quite basic actions - but the decisions about which action to take and when is what makes this game so great. Lots of tough and interesting decisions, and I feel they offset the shortcomings.

However... Having played this game more than 10 times now, I feel that the game is perhaps a little too little focused on the combat; it often happens that there are only serious combats during the last two rounds, although earlier battles of course do happen too. This saddens me a little as, though I'm a hardcore eurogamer, would like just a little more focus on the combat system and actual fighting than the economic system. Also, the randomness of especially the hexes, the tech tiles and the VP tiles is starting to get a little more annoying.

RATING: 5
I like the exploration and research options and assymetric alien powers. The use of discs for actions, colonisation and cost is clever. Unlucky draws during early exploration can ruin a civilization's chances. The free ship upgrades and other exploration bonuses can provide a significant advantage. Not keen on the inevitable 'bash the leader' gameplay. I slightly prefer this to Twilight Imperium III due to the minimal downtime and the slightly fairer way VPs are earned.

Eclipse is definitely among my favourite board games.  It describes itself as an "epic board game of interstellar conflict" -- and that's not far off!

Each player assumes the role of a galactic superpower.  Each race has its own distinct advantages and disadvantages*.  Each player starts on a single hex tile.  Exploration involves flipping over a tile from the stack and placing it on the table, literally building the galaxy as you go.  As players explore they can come into contact with their neighbours, where conflict or diplomacy can result.

The game uses cubes on numbered squares to track population and resource production; each player's reference card has a track for the three resources: money, science, and materials.  As you populate systems you take cubes off of your production tracks (revealing higher numbers) and place them on the board.  This delightfully simple mechanic works beautifully at indicating who owns what while simultaneously making it impossible to forget to update a resource production counter.

Throughout the game players can make scientific discoveries to give them lasting special abilities or allow them to buy upgraded parts for their ships.  Ships' weapons, armour/shields, power generators, and engines can all be upgraded.  Players can choose to make their ships nimble glass cannons, or can load them down with armour and shields to defeat their opponents through sheer attrition.

The game can take a long time, especially with novice players.  They estimate 30 minutes per player, which seems slightly short to me.  But we tend to have a very relaxed, social gaming atmosphere.

______________
* The game also supports all players being human, making the first few games easier since everyone will have the same special abilities.

How well the game plays depends on the players a bit.  If people are turtling (exploring), it will depend on the luck of the tile draw.  So you need to react by having the ability to travel to their region and take over tiles.  Watch where you place those wormholes, or get the wormhole technology early so you have flexibility.  Don't wait too long to act (don't overbuild your military before venturing out).

Update: Not good for 2 except as a learning game because imbalances from luck in tile draws and die rolls result in runaway leader problems without the help of other players for checks and balances.

Walking by and looking at this game, it looks extremely daunting and complicated, and the setup is an effort in itself.  Suprisingly, the rules are quite straightforward and the game plays remarkably well.  You need to manage your three resources (money, science, and materials) and explore the universe in search of more resources, points, and battles with others.  Two things that stood out to me on the first play were 1) outfitting the ships is a good time and 2) getting points for being in a battle (even if you lose) is a neat twist.  **Want to play again.

--Update on second play:  I have some pretty major gripes now with the game.  1) There is no mechanism to force you into other people's space.  With no contention or possibility of fighting, the game is boring to the end.  There should be something pushing everyone to explore into the middle instead of just turtling the Sector IIIs.  2) I have the feeling the game is decided on the random factors - a) what sectors you get when exploring, b) what techs are pulled when your are start player, c) what discovery tiles you get and to a lesser extent d) the point tiles (mitigated by winning).  Too much random and not enough good play to determine the winner.  3) The best part of the game is the ship blueprints, but by the time you get a power source, some extra firepower, and the ability to move the game is in the last turns.  Ramp up time is a downer with little payoff.

Tremendous game.  Regretfully I've only been able to play a single 2p session, mostly due to our game night being too short to cram a game like this in, especially considering the AP some members are prone to.

Overall I love the theme and game play, the action marker / hex control / payment system is really elegant.  The player boards are a bitch if bumped, and the plastic ships are a little vanilla.  However, considering the price tag I should probably be glad they did not include custom minis.

[b]Also includes Eclipse: Ship Pack One[/b]

Eclipse is my go-to option for an epic-feeling conquest game that still fits in a reasonable playing time. It's certainly a hybrid design, with "Euro" efficiency and VP scoring but plenty of Ameritrashy direct conflict and space combat dice chucking. 

All the "civ building" elements are there, with exploring, exterminating, tech trees, and resource management. The ability to customize your ships by dropping any number of technology tiles onto a ship blueprint is super-cool. The different alien races nudge players in different directions toward victory without being too heavy-handed or constricting.

I can't say enough about how the game is packaged together. The rulebook is incredibly clear, the iconography is shockingly consistent and intuitive... a lot of care went into making the game as approachable as possible.

Why is it not a 10? I suppose because, at times, the back and forth dice chucking in combat feels a bit tedious and random, and the plastic ships could have been better. I suppose though, that if you buy and tech up to those red-dice cannons, you want to use them!

Many love Eclipse and for good reason as I definitely see the game has a lot to offer for players. However, I have a couple main problems with it.

Tile Laying: I love the idea of tile laying, but getting pinned in by aliens early on or being forced to throw out a tile can really hurt your economy at the start and can basically lead to you being eliminated early especially if a player doesn't form an alliance with you to help you out.

Victory Point Chit-Pull: Winning a battle is great but only gaining 1-4 victory points and that was completely random. Yes it could be mitigated by getting more pulls, but I had one combat with 4 pulls and pulled 4 1s.

Dice Rolling for Combat: While there is too much combat for my liking, the dice to resolve everything felt like it was a mechanic thrown in just to be there and didn't add anything to the game. Often times we knew the results even before we started, and in my opinion that's not where dice should be used in games.

While I may consider playing it again, I'd likely opt to play something else or tackle a game solo, which is never a good sign for a game.

RATING: 7
An excellent game of exploring the galaxy and building a stellar empire.  The base game doesn't handle alliances very well, but the Rise of the Ancients expansion makes great strides on that front.

There is a temptation to compare this to Twilight Imperium, but the two games have very different goals.  Eclipse sets out to be a 4x PC game rendered into cardboard and plastic.  TI is designed to simulate sprawling space opera epics.  While I've not played TI, Eclipse certainly succeeds at its goal.

I find this game a bit tough to rate.  It's long, has player elimination, and subject to gamey play.  If you get off to a bad start, and a jerk (or two) pounds on you, you can be out of contention for the next several hours.  I'm not sure I like the random appearance of techs to research, or the manner in which players can "swoop" in to suicidally grab last turn VPs.  There's a a lot to like here, but for the game length, it's also a sadly fragile game, reminiscent of the chaos we'd tolerate back in the '70's, but a title that I'm not sure I have time for now.  Our copy has tons of after market organizational aides, without which the game would be horribly fiddly.

Pure 4x. Wonderful in it's scope, exploration, ship upgrading, and civilisation management. There is a lot to keep track of, but the races all bring unique skillsets which provides great replayability. The only doenside is the playing time - this is not a small game by any stretch of the imagination. Well supported, with plenty of free pnp additions (which I do hope will be compiled, printed professionally, and sold as a complete set once a few more have been released). Exactly the sort of game that I love, and this is a joy to play.

Sold - only because I have the iOS version, which is a LOT quicker.

UPDATE 8/17. Y'know what? Eclipse gets a 7. Eclipse is, in my opinion, as good a civ-building game as Through The Ages is, and in many ways better.

There's problems, no doubt -- I'm still not sold on the idea that Plasma Missiles aren't problematic from a design perspective, though they're not irretrievably broken, and I still have a bug up my ass about the turn order thing -- but Eclipse is a worthy game, if ludicrously overproduced.

(My pet hypothesis: you could fix the plasma missile thing if you find them annoyingly destabilizing by fishing the plasma missile tech tiles out of the bag the turn after the first player buys them and make them all available in addition to the normal tech draws. First player to buy them gets one turn to go on a spree if they're so inclined, and other players can either reach for plasma missiles as a balance-of-terror countermeasure OR concentrate on effective counters if the first player goes heavy into building unbalanced "missile boat" designs.

---

So I bought the iOS version, figuring a game this beloved must be worth a second shot.

I am a bit moved, enough so to bump this from an indifferent 5 to a mildly enthused 6. I like the ship-building -- quite a lot, actually. Research is cool but hampered by forces beyond my control. I loathe the clockwise-from-the-first-to-pass turn order; when combined with the random draw of technologies this can be almost game-breaking through (almost) no fault of my own. (This would be less of an issue if there weren't technologies that seem to be decisively better than others.) Determining next turn's play order by the order of passing seems like an obviously better solution. Buckets of dice for combat is fine in theory but overlong in practice; there are sound mechanical reasons for wanting combat to be an all-or-nothing proposition but one wonders if something more like, say, Here I Stand's one-round combats might reduce the downtime.

My take: a solid game whose rep has been juiced up beyond belief by being just enough Euro mechanics for the Eurogamers, just enough direct conflict and randomness for the AT crowd, and being in a category of games so dominated by dreck that a halfway decent game playable in a reasonable duration seems like the Second Coming by comparison. For me, it's as much fun as I can reasonably expect playing a 4X game. I would absolutely play again, I would not dream of buying it at anywhere close to MSRP, and I feel like 7 bones for the first-rate iOS version was money well spent.

We played 7 players.

The couple sitting to my right took 30 minutes each per turn, with no apologies.

Some were very lucky flipping over the random tiles.

The Orion player would have won a battle if he had rolled anything higher than a 1.  He rolled a 1.

The two players who tunneled and turtled tied for the win after 9.5 hours.

Why is this rated higher than Dominant Species??

It is an interesting game, but when I commit to over 5 hours on a game, I don't want winners to be determined by luck.

Update:

A year of plays later this game continues to shine.  I haven't touched TI:3 since.  This game is simply better in nearly every respect.  I continue to be impressed with the tightness of the design, its engaging universe, and the depth of play.  It has everything I could ever want in a space game.

pros

the coolest player mats i've ever seen. ship design has incredible variety and is great fun. the game components are very well done; the game has fantastic theme and will feel very different play to play.

cons

the game length is long. on the one hand you need this to feel like you have enough time to execute on your strategy on the other this is a big investment of time.

victory is heavily influence by table politics and who is sitting next to whom. if you want to win in this game and you strategically place yourself between two players who don't enjoy war mongering, you are at a huge advantage.

a bit too much randomness in terms of which technologies come out of the bag - a lot of strategies hinge on a handful of techs that may show up early, may show up often, may never show up, etc.

too much downtime - even taking one action at a time can lead to a lot of waiting around in 5+ person games.

Definitely worth it !

Eclipse is one of those rare large game that have good complexity, complex strategies and that keeps all players involved from the beginning to the end of a game.Even if average game takes 2-3 hours depending on number of players, I've seen very few dead time during our games. The only thing that is taking some times is the set-up, try to have ready bags with starting package for all players and its gonna save you a lot of problems.

One very good aspect of this game is its replay value, with an interactive galaxy that can change from game to game, different ways to achieve victory points (exploration, military invasions, building monoliths, maxing out tech, diplomacy) and different alien races you can play many game without using the same pattern. Some players dont like the randomness of technology tiles but in my opinion it gives different flavors to different games. Some techs will be harder to find and when they come out players will tend to rush toward it or try to save for them, it also forces you to always rethink your strategy. 

The more I play this game the more I like it, and i'll surely grab the expansion soon enough.

Well designed
Lots of customisation and strategies available
Super replay value
Lots of fun

Likes: An epic space game that is very streamlined. The rules and game play are intuitive. The different powers also feel very different. My absolute favorite thing about this game is probably the ability to customize your ship classes.

Dislikes: It may seem like a lot for new players at first. There is dice for combat, but this is easily "avoided" with targeting computers.

I was very sceptical since I saw the prototype few years ago at Essen fair. I'm happy to see that the game has been evolved since then.
I like some aspects of the game very much: customizable ships are great, the way how your actions depend of that how much money you have, etc.
But as much I'd like to love the game, I can't because of the uncontrollable randomness. I think it's not fair way to give out victory points based on random tile draws. Also it's disturbing that all the hexes aren't connected with each other, which means that it's too easy to avoid contact with your opponents.
I think that after some rules tweaking, Eclipse might be pretty good space exploration game, but it would never match with Twilight Imperium, which is and will be my favorite.

A more mechanical version of Twilight Imperium. Whenever I get a group together, it's always for TI, not Eclipse. I like the resource mechanic and the custom ships, but the random acquisition of technology and the random space tiles are a huge put off.

RATING: 8
A great, epic game with a real feeling of tension.  Eclipse is one of those games where you find that there are moments when everyone is standing around the table instead of sitting.

I'm not sure how fair it is to describe this as a "4X" game.  Though it certainly fits all the criteria of the genre, it also captures everything I love about Space Opera.  It's by no means a short game, but it feels like a romp -- like an adventure.  

The unique traits of the different alien races (present in the base game and made even better with the expansion) allow civilizations to develop unique personalities as the game progresses.  Everything, of course, is shaped and guided by player choices and experiences, so even two human factions can end up looking, thinking, and behaving very differently by the end of the game.

There are downsides, however.  It can eat up your night, and is particularly susceptible to analysis paralysis since it punishes carelessness pretty severely.  It also has a fairly high barrier to entry for new players.  

Finally, the use of standard d6 rolls to resolve combat gives combat outcomes a high degree of randomness -- a bit too much randomness for my taste.  I absolutely think deterministic combat would be a mistake here, but the combat would benefit from tightening the probabilities a little.

All-in-all, though, Eclipse is an amazing game for creating great, compelling stories that will stick in your memory long after the game is done.

Played this the first time on Monday nights at Mindgames Canberra (thanks to Richard and Basil for taking the time to teach this game). My first impression was that it was quite long and I didn't enjoy the amount of dice rolling involved. I played again another Monday night and enjoyed my second play much more (even though we discovered at the end we weren't playing with all the tiles in play much to Richard's disappointment). This is a game I could really enjoy after a few more plays (I think I am more across the various shield/weapons/power configurations now which is an important element of the game).

Played a fourth time and this game is really growing on me. I have been trying to figure out what appeals to me so much about this game. I think it is because there are strong elements of micro strategy and macro strategy involved which interestingly is lacking in many other board games - I have to admit however I haven't tried many war games which I expect would have these traits. Time to upgrade its rating. 

8/11/2012 - Time to upgrade its rating again (after my fifth play). I really love this game.

My kind of "conquest" game.  The focus is still dominating your opponents through combat, but there are many civilization building elements that round out the gameplay very well.

Now after a second play I'm excited to try out the alien factions - adds a nice amount of variety.

Review [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/744857]here[/url]

I was actually interested in discussing anyway, especially to try to figure out what set of variants would make it work for me, but it became too painful when the rabid fans repeatedly attacked attempts at discussion that were anything less than flattery, so I've given up.
---
Update: Ugh. Rating falling fast. On life support. This is way too much pulling the slot wheel for me. Lucky rolls on the dice in combat are not even close to the main aspects of luck. And annoyingly very little to do about it. The exploration draws are just really painful how swingy they are. You might get what you want, you might not. You might have to fight aliens there before colonizing, you might not, you might get a random discovery bonus, you might not. The discovery bonuses also vary wildly in usefulness, especially depending on what you may already have. I hate to just give up on the game, so I think we're going to start experimenting with various house rules. But we're talking major revisions, not minor tweaks. This needs a lot of work to be worth repeat plays.

Played with four players. No PvP combat took place. We quickly allied in a 2v2. Vann had good luck against the Alien. Brian had no luck against the Aliens. I lost dreadnoughts to aliens thanks to a poor design. I also drew tiles which I should have thrown back. 

Easy to learn and explain. Enough down time to plan the next action without much waiting. Tech track is good and easy to understand. 

I'm sure we didn't play correctly, but the choices we made made sense at the time.

This is an amazing game - scratches the TI3 itch while dropping the cumbersome wall-of-text rules (with accompanying exceptions/special cases), distilling the essence of space empire-building into a simple, approachable, and extremely fun experience. Things I like:

* The game literally plays in ~40 minutes per player while not feeling short/rushed
* There are a variety of valid strategies ranging from econ-focused to military-focused, and we've seen many different approaches win
* The iconography is very clear and the rules are very simple, making rulebook checks infrequent
* The population and influence mechanisms are brilliant, seamlessly handling upkeep, resource production, and action limitations without being fiddly

In short, this is an outstanding game.

RATING: 6
A good game, filled with a great theme and cool mechanics! Sadly (even with an expansion) the developers have not fixed the endgame... 

With a fixed number of rounds (8) Eclipse suffers from a "build up phase" - usually the first 5~6 rounds and then a combat phase - usually rounds 6~8. Seeing as round 8 is the last one, people dont care at all about the economy ect...

As stated earlier the developers could easily have fixed this in the expansion, but sadly didnt...

A simple "first to 100 VP", a variable number of turns (say 6-9) would also stop the late game abuse...

No es mi tipo de juego pero reconozco que debe ser bueno. Un poco largo pero es normal en estos juegos de 4X. Azar presente en las batallas pero puedes mitigarlo mejorando tus naves, y azar presente en la exploración de losetas. Como tengas mala suerte en la exploración, te arruinará la partida desde el principio y estarás acabado (que se lo pregunten a Sara)! Mucho setup inicial y recogida final. Tarifa plana.

It plays quick, has new techs, combat is fine, it hits a great balance with everything you would like in a 4X space game.  I enjoy the random seeding of the available techs each turn, Steam and others use random seeding at turn start and it is always fun and adds an element of anticipation and this does also.

I know I haven't quite explored the full depths of this game.  But the variety it has offered so far pleases my palette.  I thoroughly enjoy how individualized and unique the game boards are with being to choose (with few restrictions) the resources you want to excel in.  And being able to upgrade your ships is pure genius.  This is, however, not a game my wife would like to play with me, but I'm pleasantly surprised how my 8 year old son has taken a liking to it, and understands the concepts well enough.

Great space based galactic heavy euro game.  Eclipse makes for a fun multi-player gaming experience.  With combat, technology, space exploration, racial advantages and a whole lot more - this game has it all.  My only issue was with the missiles as a technology which can be greatly manipulated if deployed in force - and which can lopside the game.  The expansion has mitigated this missile problem and has made the game even better.  Eclipse has made my top 50 euro style games of all time.

For me, this game falls into this bizarre category. The learning curve is too harsh and there are imbalances that essentially ruin the game for an inexperienced player. Because the opportunity to bust out a multi-hour game isn't so common in my life, and it is even less common to play this with a group of similarly experienced players, the fact that there are severely imbalanced technologies and races puts this game in the trash heap for me. If I had a steady group of people to play this with again and again, I suspect I would like it.

Very well designed 4X title with a definite focus on economics rather than combat.
This has some luck of the draw and dice-rolling but also a lot of tactical more euro mechanisms. Ship designing is one of my favourite mechanics in this game. 
Everything is well thought out and combines into a very smooth gameplay loop. The different races feel varied enough and it doesn't get boring.
If you like the basegame you need to at least get Rise of the ancients.

Eclipse should be perfect in almost all aspect of 4x/Civ game. It has the exploration, tech researching, engine building, combat, and many things. Just tiny minor nitpick, it's [b]almost[/b] perfect. 

Most of the game weigh heavily on combat. Half of the tech is around military, and basically instead military is one of the tools to win, in here military is THE tools to win. Doesn't mean this is a bad game, just not really what I expected in 4x/Civ game. The tech is not that interesting either, since most of it just better stats, not additional abilities.

But in the end, I can't deny that it's almost perfect game. So I'd love to play it always.

A very good game that brings many new concepts to design. The space theme is not "tacked on" and I respect that. I understand that the goal was to have a epic space game that can be played in a short amount of time, and IMO this was a success. I enjoy how your resources are dependent on how much population you use for each. There is also a good amount of interaction among the players.

My primary complaint that it is fairly easy to turtle (IME) if you explore aggressively and point wormholes away from you.

For trade in UK Math Trade or BGG Trade.

A great "4X" game: eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, eXterminate.  Eclipse uses Euro mechanics but has an Ameritrash theme and it works really well.

Super solid, clever, mechanics but sometimes the game feels like it ends a bit abruptly though.

Good variety with different races to play.  Lots of choice of technologies to try out.

Lots of interesting decisions to be made as to how much you explore the galaxy and/or how much you attack the Ancient Ones and other players.

Overall a really cool sci-fi, 4X game.

First play with 2 to see how the game works. I like the interaction of economics, exploration, technology & combat. The icons work well & the rules are straightforward despite the game's wide scope. I prefer it to TI3 which is just too cluttered & takes too long to grasp, let alone play.

Nothing has yet come close to taking Eclipse's spot as our 4X, Empire building, negotiation, conflict game.  There's lots to manage, lots to develop, lots of strategies to adopt and lots of decision to make, and that's just counting the game mechanisms.  The real game is in negotiation and table talk.  Normally I don't like that sort of game, but I think I like it more in Eclipse because it also lets me build an empire.

Sometimes I'll go out and be aggressive (and, unfortunately, I'll be too eager and go out before I'm ready, getting stomped for the rest of the game), other times I'll turtle up and build a science empire.  I like that flexibility.  I like how peoples' personalities can come out in the races that they play.

It doesn't get played a lot, due to the time and player requirement, but it does what it does very well, so it stays in the collection.

First play = WOW! This. Is. Good. Initial rating is a 9, only because I don't give a rating of 10 after only one play, but I could see this getting there. There's so much awesomeness in this one. It kind of, in a strange way, reminded me of Merchants & Marauders x10 with much more going on and much less down-time. WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW!

Fantastic game. It runs a bit long, and I tend to feel that the dice-rolling element takes away from the game, but that could just be a result of being on the losing end of one too many "can't lose" battles. Also a long set-up/take-down time, and not a good game to play on a wobbly table with jostle-prone folks. All that aside, this game is terrific and highly recommended.

I really love it but tend to not like the ending, like similar games, when the powerful clash against the powerful. Feels a bit anticlimactic for me.  But I probably just need to play more and tap into the endgame subtlety and countermoves more. Not a short game though for that.

This game nails it on so many levels. Exploring, especially with expansion content, is exciting. Discoveries are frequently very cool. Available techs and their staggered arrival make for very interesting tactical decisions. Combat is dice-chucking at its best. The various races are significantly different, engender very different strategies, and yet for the most part feel balanced. The game is visually beautiful with a symbology that, while daunting at first, really does become intuitive. And ship design, oh my god, ship design--it's a perfect challenge. There are very few 4X games (or games, period) where so many diverse systems are woven together so seamlessly and make for a gaming experience whose every decision feels interesting and meaningful.

There are some problems that can't be overlooked, however. The largest of which is that poor luck during one's first few explorations can severely limit your options and possibility for success down the line and the ways a player can mitigate that poor luck (discarding poor hexes or pushing inward) aren't effective enough. My other complaints are much more minor. The game runs a little too long for many situations; even with four experienced players, you're likely to hit three and a half hours, which can be prohibitive, though I'm not sure a game like this can (or should) be any shorter. And, finally, it is a monster of a game to teach. Again, this really just comes with the territory; but it is worth considering.

RATING: 7
Really liking this game.  Relatively simple rules, simple end-of-turn accounting, and a VP-scoring system that disfavors turtle-ing.

Non-negligible randomness is definitely built into the game's design.  But I only care if randomness makes the game less fun, and here it does not appear to. 

UPDATE: Plasma Missiles are OP. It's a shame because the rest of the game is awesome.  Need to find a house rule to remedy the situation.

The elegance of a euro's game mechanics with the ameritrash big space battles and backstabbery. Fantastic game, only negative is it can be a long game but on the flipside it is one of the fastest playing of its type. Some niggling issues here and there such as a lot of encouragement to be a warlike spacefaring species as opposed to a total pacifist, but there is still a lot of great gameplay in this one. Would play it any time. Recommend the expansion as soon as you finish the first game, adds a lot too.

Great game. What appeals to me is the depth of the game with rather simples rules AND limited playing time. Many games like this are fiddlier with a lot of tiny rules and (therefore) take a couple of hours to play. Players have a lot of freedom in how to play. Several paths can lead to victory. Luck factor is present, but can be prepared for and so be minimized; thematically strong; good with different amount of players. Replayability is great, every game is different. Nice to equip your own ships. The economy mechanism is very good (influence track and placement of population).

Finally played this thing.
Not a bad game, but it definitely was way overhyped. The hype and the bgg ranking made me expect a great game and it's definitely not as good as it's made out to be.

It's the first time BGG's rankings fail me. This, imo, should be in the top 250-300. Still a good game, but not great.

Reason: too much luck. You can be planet-screwed, tech-screwed, etc. To points where it's impossible to win whatever you do. I love a little luck in games, but not too much in a 4X game. Also: horrible components. Ships much too big for the hexes and artwork and presentation is meh. Have difficulty finding where techs go on the board because of not enough art variations between tiles.

For a similar game (civ/euro) i'd rather play Through the Ages...

I'd still play it though. Not great game, but definitely a good one.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Eclipse is very nearly the perfect game as far as I am concerned. It has just the right amount of luck and depth combined with extremely intuitive rules. It also supports a variety of player counts (all of them well too) and plays in a reasonable time. The components are very high quality and the game looks pleasing on the table. Based on my plays, all worries about plasma missiles, bankruptcy and exploration draws have been proven wrong. I strongly believe that while there is some luck in Eclipse there are also enough ways to mitigate the effects. Bankruptcy is a viable tactic that can be used but is usually not worth it. Plasma missiles require different tactics to be used against but are by no means a huge game changer.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
This game is to Master of Orion, what TTA is to Civ. Although Eclipse is much more in the Ameritrash school of play, it has very elegant rule set.

That and the short playtime for its nature (4X) makes it a pretty remarkable game.  But it is still Ameritrash “King of the Hill” done up in space. Huge luck (in terms of alien space tech, and dice rolling)… but fun.   In the light of the next day (after a second play), it is not a game that I am totally clamoring to get to the table again and again and again. [The definition of a 9 or higher for longer games]. It is just below that threshold – an 8.5.  This is the game I would have played to death back when I was a teenager.

I will happily play it if suggested though. Quite remarkable really.

Reminder to look for Ipad version, when it comes out.

I'm incredibly impressed with this design.  The way your board automatically tracks your production, the way there is kind of a tech tree but not really, the way fighting gets you VPs... 

A lot of thought was put into this system, and I think from a game design point of view, this game is a 10, but it is rated a bit lower because I don't often want a three hour space game with player combat.  Whenever I ever want one, though, this is it!

RATING: 8
Twilight Imperium 3, streamlined with euro style mechanisms and simple rules. A fully developped game in contrast to TI3 which have a Do It Yourself feeling, sometime.

Shorter 2 to 3 hours. The "ship design" options are very good. Could have done without random factors for exploration and technology.

Classic for a 4X. A little lack of flavour or epic sense compared to TI3, but a solid base for possible expansions. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A solid, innovative game with some of the best thought out graphic design you will ever encounter. Considering how much is going on its surprisingly easy to learn and play.  Ship design is a blast, as is the game of chicken on everyone's borders. Combat is a little too dicey for my taste, but makes the game less predictable than it might be otherwise. The expansion added some much-needed variety and helped fix a few issues. My group's tendency to turtle until the end of the game probably makes this less interesting than it might otherwise be.

My set includes the Daedalus insert and plastic piece overlays.

One of the best designed games I don't want to play. Super solid yet very dry. I didn't really engage with my 2-4 actions per turn, and may have played it too safe so that it's my fault but the choices were a little obvious and the tension was pretty low for me, making it a game I will play but not excited to
 play.

Things I like:  This is the space combat/exploration game I've been waiting for since I got into boardgames. It has great production value, tons of plastic ships, loads of cool dice, interesting races with unique special powers, interesting technological upgrades, etc.

Things I don't like:  I hate losing really hard when the dice refuse to resolve in my favor.  Yes, there are plenty of strategies to mitigate this, but damn if I don't get my arse kicked time and again.

Also, the luck in what technologies come up can be brutal in a 2 player game; if 1 player is fortunate enough to get a good weapon upgrade and then another isn't drawn for many rounds, the player left with the pea-shooters is pretty much damned.

Also, the player boards and the tech board are too thin, and the corners curled up before playing even 1 game.  Plus, the art on the hex tiles seems to be peeling off quite a few of them.  A little disappointing for $100, though the rest of the components are really top notch.

Despite my complaints, I really like this game, and I think it will be even better when I get a chance to play with more than 2 players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Initial impression/rating: If this had been my first exposure to this kind of game, I might have rated it higher than an 8, but after having already played Through the Ages, I didn't get that rush from being exposed to something new (at least in terms of mechanics). I'm told this game fires Twilight Imperium as well, both thematically and 4X-wise. I've never played TI, and apparently now I don't need to.

However, I've yet to even try the other races beyond the initial humans, so I hope Eclipse's rating will go up with more plays and I look forward to what the expansion has to offer.

Update: More games played offer mixed reactions. The play doesn't get old because games can be so radically different each time, dependent upon what tech becomes available and when, what did you get when exploring tiles, who are your neighbors, etc. So that's a huge plus. But I had found my first few games a bit dis-jarring having to shift mental gears from playing a cube-pushing Euro for my first seven turns to suddenly finding myself in the middle of an Ameritrash dicefest for the last two. And the game really should be played among players with similar Eclipse-experience because it's too easy for someone to get out front and stay there unless people recognize that it's in their best interest to stop them sooner rather than later. It can be a pretty negative experience for a novice player going up against Plasma Missiles (PMs) in a non-Rise of the Ancients expanded game without a proper understanding of just how devastating PMs can be. Only experience can teach them they needed PMs as well (assuming they were available), or shields and improved hulls to hopefully survive a PM assault, or to have gotten started immediately on a pinning strategy by building a massive fleet of cheap interceptors, all in the hopes of taking away resources from the PM equipped player before they became too powerful. This is all theoretical, of course, as I've yet to even win a game, so what do I know? Apparently not much -- easier said than done I guess.

Yet despite the bitter taste left from each loss, I find I still want to play. It might be strictly nothing more than the desire to solve the game before being done with it, but I suspect that's not the case.

RATING: 7.5
Excellent job at making an enjoyable game as a shorter, simpler alternative to TI3. In fact, I'm cooling to TI3 recently and favoring this title. 
I find it much more fun to attempt to avoid combat in Eclipse. It's just too much effort to try to figure out the capabilities of my enemies' fleets, that it's best just to use diplomacy and build monoliths.
Artwork and ship sculpts are pretty cheesy. TI3 definitely has the upper hand in those areas.

RATING: 9
Re-evaluated my thoughts after another play with another group. The game doesn't drag as long as players aren't prone to AP.

Pros: Really elegant turn and resource balance mechanism. Maximizing your turn while competing for tech and area is great.

Neutral: No trading or auction mechanism often found in other strategy 4x games. I don't miss it here because those aren't my favorite mechanisms anyway.

Cons: Races may not be balanced for certain player counts.

Swingy game despite appearing like a Euro. Powerful tech outliers and snowbally. Still a fun game to play.

Eclipse is a very mixed bag.

On the one hand, the player boards give an incredible amount of interesting options... four different types of highly customizable ships, three different technology tracks and three different currencies. The price-based action disc mechanic is simply outstanding--deciding whether to take one more action, hoping you don't come up short on money at the end of the round is a tense decision-making experience. The actions themselves are also well-designed and the ability to take some weaker actions even after you have passed is just very well done.

But on the other hand, there's a huge amount of luck in the game. (If you choose to pursue a combat strategy, or if combat gets forced on you by aggressors, it's frequently going to come down to good/bad dice rolls. Combat often involves several rounds of Risk-like back-and-forth dice rolling.) Don't misunderstand me, though. Having everyone "play nice" would ruin a game like this, no question.

There's also a huge amount of luck in what you discover in your early turn explorations. Some players will get a few resources, others will get highly powerful alien ship upgrades which endure all game. Some sectors will be rich in resources while others have nothing at all. Two or three poor explorations early on will put you at a decided disadvantage.

Lastly, the reputation points you draw can be horribly variable. Some players will be drawing 3s and 4s while you draw nothing but 1s. At the end of the game, you'll have 4 points in reputation and they'll have 10 or more. (And this is not a very high-scoring game... about 30 points for a winning score.)

So, I'm conflicted. The parts of the game which are good are very good or outright excellent. But there are parts of the game which really make it seem like "Super Risk in Space". If the game was much, much shorter, the luck factor would be fine... but this is a long game with a lot of very serious strategic decisions to make.

I love it. I hate it.

EDIT: Repeated plays, including trying several of the variants suggested in the forum for reducing randomness, have not changed my opinion. If anything, I'm more frustrated by the randomness. I really wish I just disliked the whole game, but there are parts of it worthy of a '10'.

A final observation based on more plays... There's a significant "rich get richer" aspect to the game... which can occasionally lead to player elimination (or, more often, virtual player elimination where a player occupies only a hex or two... no production, no influence).

*sigh* For my tastes, the game is just fundamentally flawed. I wish, really wish, it wasn't.

After a couple of plays, I wondered if Eclipse was destined to become my new favorite game--supplanting Dune.  I don't believe that is so, as I've cooled on it of late.  I still like it enough to have purchased my own copy.  The game utilizes an excellent econ system that reminds me a bit of Through the Ages.  It also allows for alternative ship builds like Galaxy Trucker.  The orders system and the tech really get my engine revving.  The only thing I don't care for is the randomness of the initial exploration, which can really put you in a bind early in the game.  I think that you just have to play this aggressively, which is not my usual style for an empire builder game.

I want to rate it higher, but luck plays a pretty large factor in this game in exploration draws. I don't mind it so much in combat, but if you get bad draws and stumble in the beginning it'll hurt you later. Otherwise, a very epic yet streamlined game. Overall, I like the game a lot.

Edit: after repeated plays, I've seen that the draw luck is easily mitigated by being able to discard tiles you don't want.

Broken game that nobody in my gaming group likes. Basically solitaire turtling, followed by a mad dash during the last two-three rounds.

We have remade the rules (especially reduced randomness) and fixed some serious issues to promote warfare and the game is now quite fun.

RATING: 3
I can see the appeal of this game, especially to eurogamers, due to the action selection mechanics and scoring mechanism. The ship upgrades and combat are both interesting and easy, and the different colored dice are a nice, simple way of working with weapons upgrades. Everything just seems to fit together well.

Alas, all is not entirely well. I think the early exploration tiles can have a significant long term effect. Getting too many pirates early and consistently can put you a turn behind at least, and I'm not sure the rewards for killing pirates are really enough to make up the difference. Special weapons and shields are nice, but players need money most of all. The timing of the tech tiles and the luck of the draw on the VP chips could be game breaking as well. The ability to turtle by intentionally not connecting various warp points could definitely be an issue, too.

On top of that, there's definitely a rich-get-richer feeling to the whole thing and if you get picked on early there's really no coming back. In one game I played the guy who won did so handily, with myself coming in a solid but distant second. The other three players weren't even close.

One could argue that the other players didn't respond properly to the main threat on the board, but that's an issue inherent to games like this. In action selection games players tend to avoid investing in actions merely for the sake of confronting other players, especially if it doesn't coincide with whatever approach they've already invested in. The fact that eurogamers tend to be conflict-averse can exacerbate the problem, too.  This can be even more of an issue if you're playing with races like the Planta. You must connect to them early and attack or they're simply going to run away with the game.

Despite these problems I can see why the game is popular. It's clear the gaming community was looking for a lighter version of Twilight Imperium III with familiar mechanics and, for many, they've found it. As for myself, I think the game is good but not great. At least it's shorter.

UPDATE: More plays, rating continues to drop. Early exploration tiles can prove way too significant, and losing an early battle I should have won pretty much knocked me out of one game. Combined with lucky VP tile draws by the winner that game wasn't even close. In another I got cut off by my neighbors and couldn't really even get into combat, and the tech tiles came out in a goofy order. Sorry folks, but this is a game I will now actively refuse to play.

TL;DR - random exploration + random vp + random tech == random winner.

UPDATE2: I went and bought the steam app, thinking it might be ok against AI opponents and I could get better at it. The result was that my rating has dropped even farther as it only served to solidify my original complaints about the game. Way too much randomness that effectively determines the winner more than your actions. Oh, and missiles. Dear god, the missiles.

I can't figure out why this game rates so highly.  Played it last night and was underwhelmed.  Too much randomness.  I understand random exploration tiles, but they can have massive consequences.  In our game, the game leaders and losers were immediately apparent after tiles were placed.  Three hours later, nothing had changed.  Then there are random VPs.  Then there are random tech developments, which make no sense thematically ("Scientists, are the advanced hulls completed?"  "Well sire, they were, but now we can't research them".  "What?!  Why?"  "Well, the civilization to our immediate right researched them.  And now no one else can until they come up again.")  I thought the ship upgrading was unique, and enjoyed this.  Otherwise, it's a 4X game with dice, little plastic ships and randomness.  Nothing new to see here.

Upped my rating to a 10 after a couple more plays. This is a fabulous game and everyone I've played it with, including people completely unware of the hype online, have loved it.
Classic 4X action with an elegantly implemented technology and ship development mechanism. This is all bundled into a tight time allocation. Players need to get the most out of thier limited number of actions through the game, but unlike other games which may have a hard limit to the number of actions, Eclipse allows players to take more, but wear the escalating costs to do so.
There are multiple paths to acrue victory points and the early explore actions will often force a player down a particular path. But this is the beauty of the game. Rather than being able to continually finesse the one strategy, a good player needs to be able to identify the main chance and skillfully implement it.
The evidence that this is a game of skill is there as player scores increase significantly with each play.
Definitely my hot, "I love it" game of the moment.

The first two hours were mind blowingly cool.  Giddy with exploration and alien hunting.  At hour 3, my ally takes galactic center and I'm completely walled off from the rest of the game.  What ensues are hours of ridiculous battles, with tons of dice rolling and no ground being taken.  The bombing rules are incredibly stupid (neutron didn't arrive until late).  Someone loaded up a ship with 4 missiles, to counter, my ally loaded their ships with 9 hull.  Total slow motion lockup.  I was taking turns about every 45 minutes and my turns consisted of buying monoliths.  Soul crushingly BORING.  All this fighting and nothing interesting happened.  I won by a landslide and I didn't care, no one else cared either.  We blew 5 or so hours on this, for nothing.  I'd like to try again but my god the combat in this thing makes Risk look brisk and elegant.

After playing Ecplipse some more, I feel the need to adjust my rating. As it turns out, my excitement for this game has dropped a little. While I do still think it's one of the finest 4X games that I have played until now, I also noticed that it is not really my type of game. It my be due to group think, but most of the game I participated in had far too much direct conflict for my liking. As a result of this, my rating drops from 8 to 6. Don't get me wrong: I still think this is a very good game if you like this kind of games and don't mind direct conflict in a multiplayer environment, it's just not for me. I do enjoy some direct conflict, but more or less only in a two player setting. Played with only two players, Eclipse still gets an 8.

[2011-12-22 Rating: n.a. -> 8]

The 8 rating was made after my first play which was with two players. So the rating might go up or down with further plays. Now on to the comment:
I was a little unsure whether I wanted to try Eclipse or not. Lately, I realized that I'm not a huge friend of games with direct conflict since often times the winner is the one who manages to stay under radar the best and therefore get's attacked the less. 
But Eclipse turns out to be another beast. It is more reminiscent of games like "Through the Ages" in that it is mostly a resource management game. You win the game by securing the most victory  points (VP). You get them for researching a lot of technologies in one branch, for building and keeping a special building, by possessing star systems or, but only to a minor degree and with uncertain outcome, by participating in battles. In order to get there, you do have to manage your resources in the best way possible. Since the game lasts only nine rounds, you should better make sure that you don't waste any of them.
The game itself is very streamlined and thanks to the turn structure, there isn't a lot of downtime betweens your turns. I guess, it's more euro than ameritrash in this regard.
The player boards are ingenious. There is no need to count your systems every turn or look at a myriad of cards to figure out which technologies power your ships. Everything is front of you.
To sum it up, I haven't had this much fun playing a civilization type game in a long time and I'm looking forward to my next play.

Impressive space epic that has quite a bit going on, but is aided by some thoughtful graphic design that makes it work. Packs a lot of strategic play into an attractive and impressive package.

It's in space, so there's +1 already. It takes all the cool elements from Twilight Imperium, without the tedious mucking around with too many cards and counters, and consolidates them very nicely into a consistent theme. It's more fun, less fiddly, and takes mercifully much less time to play, yet seems to have the same (if not more!) complexity and flexibility in strategy due to a masterful integration of the carefully interlocked mechanics. There's just the right balance of exploration, development, resources, combat, and diplomacy. In sum, just about the perfect board game.

This game looked incredibly complex when we first started playing, but started to make sense very quickly thereafter.  However, it took us 5-1/2 hours to play this! Admittedly, we were playing with the AP poster kids, but still...  I mean, c'mon!  We could have gotten 3 other games played in the same amount of time.  Plus, in the end, it just came down to who had the most ships/biggest guns, which is pretty much how all these type of games turn out.  Not one I'll be jumping at a chance to play again any time soon.  I give it a low rating based solely on how (way too) long it is

Eclipse is a space exploration, tech tree growth, improve your space ships, and battle with other players game.  The core mechanics are very tight and clean, but there are so many things to research, that my first game experience was very muddled and over-whelming.  To add to the confusion, none of the icons made intuitive sense to me, so looking at the research options would nearly give me an epileptic seizure (seriously). 

By my second play, I noticed that the exploration tile flips of the first couple of rounds creates a huge swing in a players position.  Several people in my second game (6-player game) were essentially eliminated from play by the second round.  I consider this to be a pretty big design flaw.

My rating of Agricola is similar, but I like the game play of Agricola better.  They both have a clean set of core mechanics that are extremely captivating, but they have an added layer of card text options that muddle the experience for me.  

Only play Eclipse if you are planning to play it several times within the month.  If not, there are many other more enjoyable game out there.

Delivers on what it promises so far - a 4x space game that plays in a reasonable time period. Nicely integrated set of mechanics, mainly derivative it must be said, but exceptionally well put together, and not afraid to stray from it's euro foundations for some entertaining Ameritrash dice combat, which it carries rather well.

Rating may well rise with more plays - very slightly concerned that the game experience can be ruined by a poor set of surrounding tiles but experience may show ways to play to genuinely mitigate this.

RATING: 6
An 8.5. rating after our initial 4 player game (July 7, 2012).

I usually try and limit my initial rating to 8 for a game, as I have been fooled by the replay value of many, but in this case, I have decided to start at 8.5 as my expectation is that the rating will rise!

After all the hype, I expected to see a few flaws and be somewhat disappointed (as I was with Mage Knight - a good game but not my type) but Eclipse lived up to the hype. It is a clean and elegant design - uncluttered with meaningless detail either in process or specifics - tough decisions and I can see a 3-4 player game easily coming in under 2 hours with experienced players. Once you know the Techs and the tiles (and eventually the Alien powers) game play will speed up!

Everyone learned a lot in their first play and wanted to play again soon to apply what they had learned! A sign of a very good game IMHO.

EDIT: August 9th, 2012 - rating increased to 9 after another half dozen face-to-face plays with 3-6 people. Excellent game with lots of replayability - lots to think about.

EDIT: August 15th, 2012 - another week and another 3 games of Eclipse. This game is now a 10. Why? There hasn't been a game in recent memory that our Saturday and Wednesday groups have played consecutively for weeks on end like Eclipse. It's just so darned addictive. Highly recommended.

Edit: October 2012: Rating lowered to 9. This is a great game, however, it is a bit long and we have had several 5-6 player games where some players felt out of contention in the first half of the game and had to endure or play spoiler for the last half. Also we have had some kingmaker games which were unsatisfying. Still well worth playing and owning - wish it was a tad shorter though!

Final Edit: Reducing the overall rating to 8. It's a 10 when you're learning it - a 9 when you have 4 fast-playing experienced players and an 8 once you see that it has the same endgame and bash-the-leader issues as most other confrontation games. Still, everyone should play it a few times!

This is an excellent game when all players play to win.  Results are unpredictable if one of the players do not play to win the game as the player next to him will expand unchecked and usually win the game.  A frustrating experience for everyone else.  But the game has epic battles, betrayals (always planned for), and economic development.

Finally a 4X game that delivers. There's exploration, expansion, tech development and improvements of ships and there's warfare and diplomacy. The fact that it's playable in an evening and still manages to scratch that build your space empire itch is amazing.

I can't praise this game enough. Everything fits together in a simple yet elegant way. Everything is so clear and logical too. I'm impressed in a way I didn't think possible any more for a jaded player like myself.

Only played with terrans and only one play which is why it only gets a 9 for now. More plays will probably up this to a 10 as I try out aliens and different strategies.

Update: Tried aliens, fun with diversity. Rating up to 10.

The orange planet system is just boring and lame.  Not saying broken, just saying not fun at all.  You don't flip orange, you lose.  Orange determines number of systems you can own and number of actions you can take.  And it is determined by tile flip.  And early on an orange planet gives you exactly enough to pay the cost of owning one planet.  You need like five to get past breaking even and into being able to do anything else.

RATING: 4
Rating after a single, 6er game, with all human races.

The good:  For those fans of Twilight Imperium, you will love this game.  This is Twilight Imperium but with shorter playtime, and better chrome.  In fact, this game should ultimately obsolete TI.  Can't think of a reason to play TI over this.

The bad: This game has the typical flaws of a multiplayer battle-game.  You cannot afford to attack because the associated cost will cripple you with respect to the other players.  Exactly like TI, this results in a turtle-fest where big fleets are stacked and stare at one another.  Whoever attacks first loses.  Until the last turn..when the attacking opens up for points as players try to get an attack in that can't be countered due to the game ending.  Exactly like  Wallenstein, exactly like TI.  Man, I was hoping for so much more from this one, but it falls into the same traps.
That said, the chrome on this game is amazing.  The techs, the upgrades to ships, the 3 different tracks of production.  However, this is all just window dressing.  Your economic engine that affords you this chrome is heavily reliant on exploration tile draws.  Draw well, and your options open up. Draw poorly..say no tech planets, and you'll find your endgame at the mercy of other players.
And that brings me to the most negative thing about this game. If you find yourself behind the tech curve...as mentioned above, you can't upgrade.  If you are behind the money curve as well, you can't do any actions at all!  You just have to wait out the game and hope that brinkmanship from the other players will result in no one attacking you.  And while the game is shorter than TI, having no meaningful decisions to make is no way to spend half of the game (6 hours full --> 3 hours half).

Bring a book...in case this happens to you.

Players run and expand a space empire, earning victory points for expansion, exploration and conquest.  Large... very large... game where players take turns taking an action to expand, build, research, move, upgrade their way across a hex map, expanding game board.  Expansion and conquest leads to colonization, which grows economy, which allows further expansion, research and growth.  Players earn victory points for taking over tiles, getting into fights, building and researching stuff, and so on.  Eclipse tries, and does, get a lot of things right.  Simple, elegant Euro based mechanics; a nice combat system; tech tree; tuning ships, and so on.  However, it's big, really really big, and it does take a long time to play.  The game also seems rather fragile, with several random elements (the exploration, the order the technologies appear, etc).  Games of this size and length are not my thing, hence the rating, but it's easy to see why others are adoring it.  I think this game will be a LOT better with four or fewer, as the playtime will reduce and action increase.  It also feels the sort of game with a fast half life ... a few plays will see it done, whereas I'll be playing Mage Knight The Boardgame for years and still discovering stuff.  Still, very good for it's target audience.

Have only played this the once (a two player game), but I was very much impressed. This called back time playing MOOII, Civilizaiton, and Sword of the Stars computer games; the same excitement and frustration in exploring, the same thrill and trepidiation in combat, and the same joy and satisfaction as my empire grew, coming into its own as a formidible force in the galaxy. A single two-player game is not enough to make a lasting judgement, but I certainly look forward to getting Eclipse on the table again.

Edit: 10! After a few more games of this, I can't seem to get enough. I have become more enamored of the mechanics, and having played a few of the aliens, found that they were challenging and fun to play. Plan on buying this when it reprints.

An extremely well designed game that does everything it sets out to do.  It manages to blend strong economic management, exploration, diplomacy, technological advancement, and extremely clever and elegant mechanics into one amazing package.  This is another game I consider a crowning achievement in game design: there really are no "clunky parts" to this game, and even though the dice aren't always kind, they're always entertaining.  A modern classic of its kind, and one of my favorites.

Very interesting, quick playing 4X game. The systems are quite simple (despite a 32 pages rulebook) and it does live up to the box's proclamation of being 30 minutes per player.
The Euro mechanics might not be for everyone's taste, but the game is quite good. Only reservation might be with the combat system, which can be very dice intensive if proper upgrades are not bought.
Needs to hit the table a few more times. Recommended.

RATING: 10
This game is harder to find time to play than much of my collection, yet I've managed to play it quite a few times. This is one of those rare games where I appreciate just about everything in the game. Many other games just have that one or 2 things that bother you, whether it's the graphic design or one of the game mechanisms. Eclipse seems to get it just right on all fronts. It's clear a lot of love, time, and effort was put into the design, playtesting, and production. One of the things I appreciate the most is how intuitive the mechanics are. The rules are quite streamlined, and it is very easy to teach. And ship customization is really fun.

The only (very minor) downsides:
- It seems better with more players, but the play length can push the limits a bit. With the wrong set of gamers (AP or just chatty), a game with 4-6 players can get dragged out a bit. The estimated game time of 30/player assumes fast and focused play from all.
- I don't think Plasma Missiles are unfairly powerful like some others do, but I do think that with multiple plasma missiles in a ship build, the number of dice you end up throwing gets a bit ridiculous. I don't think it's overpowered, but it just seems a bit silly in comparison to the maturity of the rest of the design. I sometimes wonder if it would have been better to give them an energy cost of 1. But on the other hand this may have reduced some of the exciting moments of the game.

I'm really looking forward to seeing what they add in with the expansion.

MUCH better than TI:3 in so many ways:
-less fiddly

-no serious advantage to those who have the tech tree memorized

That being said, I don't know if this is a game I'll ever want to own. Unlike TI:3, however, I would play this again, especially since we didn't know about orbitals or monoliths until the very end of the game.

I waited for the dust to settle in the ridiculous 2011 glut of space games: Ascending Empires, Core Worlds, Space Empires 4X, Eminent Domain. Eclipse is to me the best ever made for the genre. It has a clean economic engine, plays fast, and has lots of customizing and differentiation of player powers. You can see your ships fight and dice off in star battles that are simple and fun. It is however HIGHLY chaotic in regards to tech, battles, and exploration. Be warned!

RATING: 9
Sad to see this game slipping down the ratings, it thoroughly deserves its high rating. For what it is I couldn't imagine a better package. The design of this game is superb from the influence discs revealing a more expensive economy as you control more territory and take more actions to the svelte way the technologies work (after a game you'll know what they all do), there are many examples. I think my favourite thing is not the crunchy economic element of this game but the way in which ship upgrades are done, which is excellent and quite fun. The game has a very inclusive player count, I imagine the two player game is good, and the larger numbers lengthen the game but they also increase the dynamics of the game. It's long at the higher numbers but I imagine you could get a six player game in in 3 hours, just about. I like the somber art style and the very functional components. The combat is about as streamlined as I feel it could be. Missiles upset people. And the game isn't all about combat if you wish, so the game came please hardened Euro players - though not ones with a complete aversion to luck as there's some of that in the way the new hexes come out etc. 

Overall this is an amazing game.

First play takes approximately 1 hour/person. We played with the Terran factions.  I like the combination of worker placement with increasing costs. You want to do as much as much possible, but at the end of the each round, you still have to pay the costs...challenging.

The galaxies are comparable to 'kolonisten van catan'. they are printed on tiles and one of the actions is discovering the tiles. The tiles allow a lot of replayability and the placement of the tiles is really important as it allows access or closes it.

The ancient technology provides heavy upgrades for your ships, but not something that is not manageable by doing normal research.

Played this with a friend. We were very intimidated by the sheer number of components and rules, but after about an hour of fumbling around we got into a groove. This game is really awesome. Once you understand the rules it is very simple to play with a massive amount of strategy. I am looking forward to the next game.

Game which features many hard decisions, interesting player interaction, and a real sense that you're out there conquering the galaxy.  It is long, but you don't really feel the length as your turn comes up fairly frequently.  This is contrasted with a game like Civilization where every time your turn finishes you can be waiting quite awhile until your next begins.

This has broken away from my rating "pack".  This was once described as "My fourth "9"" rating I've ever given a game.  Well, I didn't think a subsequent play would cause me to elevate the rating, but alas ... deserving of "9.5" for a multitude of reasons.

Completely engaging 4X sci-fi game which doesn't overstay its welcome.  I was skeptical - I wasn't sure how the blend of resource management would mesh with the random draws for sectors, technology - and not to mention the randomness dice bring!  But it does so with ease.  Wide appeal, and looking forward to it again, anytime (I have time).

In the handful of plays, I have found Alien races tricky to play vs. Humans.

Played it a couple of times and the game mechanics are great apart from the ability to build ships and starbases in a sector that has been invaded.  To me you should be able to move ships into an invaded sector but not build in it as that ruins a lot of strategy and kills it for me.  Shame as the rest of the game is great.

This would probably be rather higher if I was less bitter about the game. I tend to play very passively, working on developing my fleet into a really cool powerhouse, but then get attacked while I'm off-guard. Need to learn to attack sooner, but I love building up the fleet (the modular nature of ships is just this game's best thing.)

Haven't played in a while, will need to revisit this sometime soon. May come re-think my scoring.

Space civilization game in 3 hours! For 2 to 6 players. Feels best at four.

Game has great components and is heavily supported by the designer and players on this site.

There is an issue of space for the game build-out and time to setup. (Just organize the storage better)

"A game of Eclipse places you in control of a vast interstellar civilization, competing for success with its rivals. You will explore new star systems, research technologies, and build spaceships to wage war with. There are many potential paths to victory, so you need to plan your strategy according to the strengths and weaknesses of your species, while paying attention to the other civilizations' endeavors."

While there are lots of cool mechanics at work in this game (tech tree, action point system, etc), the overall feeling about it was that every game was the same: spend the whole game building up your fleet for one big showdown battle at the end of it.  We'd have fun with it for two hours only to have a completely anticlimactic ending.  It got traded away for Exodus: Proxima Centauri in January 2015.

RATING: 9
Eclipse is the Euro-ized 4x game.  I really appreciate the way everything's been streamlined, and how the game's mechanisms fit together seamlessly.  It's an impressive design for this reason.  

Ironically, though, this design is actually a lot more luck-driven in some ways than other similar games.  This stems from 2 factors.  
One, exploring the galaxy, while fun, leaves you vulnerable to bad draws.  What's forgivable in a short game isn't in one that takes 3 hours, and getting stuck without any decent planets is tough to overcome.  Even if you do get good systems, they may be occupied by neutral aliens.  This means that in order to get ahold of them, you have to build up at least a small fleet and send them in to clean out the inhabitants.  This can be action- and resource- costly, potentially putting you well behind players who get undefended systems.  
And even if you manage to get/clear off decent planets, the 3 types of resources in the game mean that you have a fair chance of being short in a critical area.  Expanding into a ton of systems with just pink (sci) and brown (prod) planets won't do you much good, since you'll have so many disks on the board and have so little money, you'll be unable to do anything.  (This is actually the 2nd best situation in some respects, because you can research the orbitals tech if it's out, then convert your excess production into new economy planets, solving your problem eventually.)  Being short on science is probably the most survivable of the 3 shortages, since you can save up and go the orbital route as above, or just deal with being behind in the tech race.  Having insufficient production, though, is the worst of the 3.  You can't build habitats to patch the problem, so the best you can do is try and get advanced mining (if it's out, and if that'll even help you).  Having a bunch of money and science means you can explore more (until the galaxy runs out) and research things and upgrade your ships a bunch, but without production you won't be able to build very many of them.  Plus, you can forget about building monoliths in the late game.
You can, of course, mitigate this by rejecting systems you don't want. This soaks up actions, though, and you usually don't have many to spare at the beginning.  The rules-as-written mean that rejecting things in the 1& 2 stacks will send them out of the game, but rejecting a 3 means that the person who explores the last 3 will get stuck with it, and know exactly what it is.

The second factor is the combat.  Since you're looking for 6s, ships can fire back and forth for a while and score hits only occasionally.  Obviously, computers help this a lot and are quite strong, but without them combats are highly luck-driven.  It comes down to who rolls above average and gets a lot of 6s early.  You could also get the reverse problem and roll buckets of dice while whiffing every time.  I've seen a player take on the GCDS and roll 40+ dice, scoring only 3-4 hits while it slowly took apart his fleet.  Naturally, he was quite unhappy.

I have a few other concerns about turtling being too strong.  Even though you're encouraged by point rewards to get into fights, you really have to have a huge econ base to try and invade & conquer someone else's territory, even on the last turn of the game.  Most of this comes down to military being way too action-costly on offense, and almost free on defense.  It takes so many action disks to move your fleets, and still more to claim any territory you get, that you can wind up bankrupting yourself.  To even get into position to attack, you've got to spend a bunch of time upgrading your fleets, and still more time building them.  The defender just has to do the upgrades, marshaling their resources until you make your move, then building a fleet where you send yours.  Of course, if you're attacking the leader, it may still be worth doing just to deny them points.  
Plus, military is made more difficult by the extreme piece-limit caps on ship classes.  Further, some of the races really encourage a defensive style.  In fact, most of the games I've played have been decided in favor of the player who turtles and build monoliths all over the place (usually me).

Despite these issues, I still like the game a lot.  If you're playing with people who know that they're doing and can plan during others' turns, it can move along at a fair clip.  The art looks good and is very functional.  Having the same budget spaceship minis as other games is a bit of a downer, but you can get the expansion to patch that if you really care.  Perhaps the game's best feature is designing your own ships tile by tile.  No other game I've seen has done this (with the possible exception of the new Xia, but that's not the same genre).

In one word: E-P-I-C!

Played it now over seven times, Eclipse is one of those games in which you need to play a couple of times in order to get the full sense of an epic galactic gameplay.
Player interaction is very strong with one for you need to figure out where your opponenets are going, what are they building and what their main strategy is and at the same time destorying (optional) their civ from preveting them to destroy yours.

Overall it should be no surprise why this game is ranked so high on BGG and will probably stay high for at least the next 5-10 years.

Brilliant and revolutionary game design of a fairly complex space empire game. It's actually a well done, heavy 4x euro/amero hybrid. However I dislike two major luck factors in this game: Exploration random tile draw, which can ruin whole game for some players and bubble up the winners, and combat dice chucking festival. I feel bad when I score 3 sixes against superior opponent who rolled three ones. 
I bought this game expecting lighter version of Twilight Imperium which I am huge fan of, but  Eclipse is not a substitution for it as it turned out. Also in the beginning, length of the game is not what it says on the box. 
I love the modular hex board and the way it expands. All components are beautiful. And I am huge fan of having many conceptually different races to choose but I am not very fond of the artwork on Eclipse race sheets.

[b]Edit:[/b] With more practice and when all players are committed and when you include Rise of the Ancients expansion game becomes competitive and fun and slightly faster. I raised the score from 6 to 8.

solid euro/At hybrid. Whilst i enjoy this game, im in the TI camp in terms of favorites. Eclipse is a tight design with a great user interface, but its also a little too conservative and short for my tastes. There will be no great galactic war, no huge dramas, or tense negotiations, but a smooth economic engine, and some interesting skirmishes with the occasional planet getting bombed before points are counted up. It ends just as its getting fun.

RATING: 9
Az első játék után 8-as körül járt az értékelése, de a második meggyőzött: 9es.
Van benne szerencse: csaták, hexák húzása (h mi lesz rajta), felfedezéslapkák, hírnévlapkák..DE: A legtöbbje ellensúlyozható, tervezhető. A csaták leginkább: érdemes komoly űrhajókat összerakni, hajótörzssel, minimum 2es sérülést okozó fegyverrel, plusz célzással... Így már bármi legyőzhető: a második játékban a galaktikus közpiont sem tudott ellenállni (nem csoda: 3 közepes hajó +3 célzással, 3 hajótörzs jellel,2 kis hajó: 2es hajótörzzsel, 2es fegyverrel)
a hexák: nos igen: itt lehet kevés pluszt húzókat szerezni, de előbb-utóbb jön jó is, az ős űrhajókat meg nem kell rögtön megtámadni...a később több, a hírnévlapkák igen szerencse h mit húz az ember, de ha többet húz esélyesebb jobb választásra.
Szóval bár látszólag sok szerencse kérdésű, de valójában annyira nem. Természetesen van szerencse benne, de jól egyensúlyozva, okosan kitalálva. 
Végig izgalmas parti, ha egyszer elsajátítod, akkor nem bonyolult szabályok.
hátrány a tényleg sok helyet foglalás, illetve a játékostáblák s a forrástábla lehetne keményebb kartonból. És az űrhexák mintha kopnának...
Szóval tetszetős.
A második partinál 2 főnek tetszett 2nek nem...az utóbbiak részben érthetők: rossz dobás, elhalálozás (nem elég erősen támadás, emiatt kicsit lemaradás) plusz elsőre hosszú játék - megint a 45 perc/ fő, a másik meg a játék feléig nem figyelt....
szóval bár az első parti után voltak fenntartásaim, a 2. meggyőzött
A 3. után is: nagyon tetszik. Ügyesen kell lavírozni a szerencse függő dolgok közt, tudni kell váltani és nem eröltetni. Természetesen jöhetnek peches szériák, de ezeket megfelelő egyéb lépésekkel kompenzálni lehet. megint hosszú lett, de azt hiszem megvan a magyarázat: a csapatban senki nem gondolkodik előre egy centit sem. Amikor rá kerül a sor, akkor átnézi mit lehet tenni, akkor tervez. Ez meg pl. egy olyan játék, ahol simán lehet 2-3 körre is előre tervezni, s mikor rám kerül a sor, akkor 1 másodperc a lépés...Na mi nem így csináljuk :-). Így persze logikus, h bármilyen játéknak a doboz idő x 1,5-2 az időnk.

I won't bother saying too much about this since, you know, everyone already has.  For me, it's a pretty great game, but the price of entry is unreasonable.  While I get the idea of this Euro-masquerading-as-4X, I'd honestly rather just play true 4X, time management be damned.

Great game with a good balance of "choices" that need to be made every turn.

Players are forced to manage their empires very carefully, which I enjoy.

Fantastic space explore game where you don't have to engage in a crazy all-out battle strategy to win.  Having multiple paths to victory and lots of cool equipment keeps this one fresh.

RATING: 8
A thematically rich and strategically deep game. I've enjoyed it every time I've played. I've also been frustrated with it every time I've played, but still want to play it again when the game is done. 

Pros:
   -the resource system is brilliant
   -alien civilizations are well balanced, and bring a necessary amount of variation to the game (seriously, start playing with aliens as soon as possible)
   -exploring, colonizing, and battling in space are all thematically rich experiences
   -the artwork and layout is engaging

Cons:
   -certain technologies and ship upgrades seem to be over- or under-powered respective to others
   -chance and luck play a larger role than I'd like them to
   -the play area ends up being prohibitively large
   -runaway leader can become a concern, especially in games with fewer players
   -game runs about twice as long as they claim it does

All in all, if you have a Saturday afternoon or an entire evening (and a giant freaking table) to spare, the game is certainly worth the investment. Some of the community-suggested tweaks here on the geek improve the gameplay considerably as well.

This game is a classic to me.  It is complex and deep, rewarding many plays.  But at the same time, one of the HUGE advantages this game has, is how intuitive and easy it is to teach.  It just simply makes sense.  As you look at the player board, and your player aides, all of the iconography of the game is so intuitive and easy to pick up.  I am confident when I bring this game to the table with new players, and gamers that might not be as experienced, that they will be able to pick this game up and have a great time playing it.

Really good 4X strategy game, although luck is no small factor. Very curious as to the rationale for the combat system that has missile combat resolved before beam weapons.

First play lots fun! Looking forward to many more games!

After a couple more plays, I am starting to see some weak spots in the game.  Every game one or two players seems to get "gimped".  They are  unable to interact with other players and eventually end up as bystanders in the game.  I also do not like the move your ships to attack THEN upgrade them.  This is strictly from a thematic point of view.  The game play is okay, but seems a bit cheesy for me.  

I do like the tech advancements and the exploration.  (Although there could be more exploration?)

RATING: 6
masters of orion the board game - or at least that is the intent of the designers, who did a good job creating that feel.

however as with all development games - early development of the initial economy is very important, and those who lag are often doomed to a LONG game, and the designers haven't done anything to help overcome the random chance factor of better initial exploration draws.... 

initial rating is a 6 - could drop to a 2 if random early tile draws continue to eliminate players or could rise to an 8, if experience allows players to overcome bad draws.

Great game! I love the aspect of building up your fleet and the whole war strategy thinking and decisions between war and peace. After a couple of games it can be played quite quickly too (under 2 hours). We did the addition of adding 3 time-tokens for all players and use a 60 second timer to limit the length of the turn. If a user wants to go over that time, they can use one of their tokens. Very nice addition to the game. Puts the pressure on a bit.

The one small gripe I have with the game is the randomly generated pool of technologies to research. I would really like to see a variation that would implement a technology tree instead of this.

Played this at Unity in 2012. The teacher did a good job of teaching the game except strategy which was a bit annoying since he was so seasoned at the game. 

The game has a lot of options and I was hyped up until we started flipping tiles. The randomness of the tiles just killed the game in about 20 minutes. Two player including myself got hosed with the tiles and ended up so far behind with no way to catch up it was almost the first game I said, can I just quit?

Too much buildup for a lackluster big battle last turn to try and screw one another. For 3-4 hours I'd rather play something else. If there was balance in the initial exploration it might be better, but it just seemed like the strategy was turtle and then hit someone in the end and get lucky with dice rolls. As someone else said I wish I had a book to read while everyone else took turns and I stared at other more appealing games across the table.

Eclipse is a euro/AT hybrid.  It's very much a Euro when you consider the strong economic aspects of the game: putting cubes from your player board to planets will increase your income in 3 types in subsequent turns.  The three types of currencies are as follows: money: needed for paying for your civilization and actions, science: needed to buy technology which helps improve your ships and can get VP if you specialize, and materials: this allows you to create ships, space stations and monoliths. During a round, you'll be removing discs from your board to take actions and control hexes of space.  For every disc you remove, you're increasing your civilizations costs at the end of the round.  It's very much a balancing act.

The ways it's like an AT game is that you are moving spaceships around hexes and combating opponents ships and taking over their areas of space.  You get to customize your ship with various technologies and roll a lot of dice when you get into combat.  The game tries to encourage combat as you will draw multiple VP chits of varying amounts from a bag after combat and so the more you take part in combat, the more likely you are to dig for the higher VP amounts.  The game also allows for creating alliances but you can also break these alliances as well.

Overall, I recognize that it's a well designed game but it doesn't suit my tastes for a number of reasons.  First, I don't really like the randomness of the hex tile draws.  Someone being surrounded by a lot of neutral ships could be a bad thing.  I also didn't really the dice for combat.  It works but isn't really appealing to me.  Finally, I don't like how it's mainly just a game of posturing for 8 rounds with minor skirmishes and then all hell breaking loose in the last round with everyone grabbing all the VP they can.

A 4x game that doesn't seem to quite know what it tries to be. There is a heavy emphasis on combat on technology tracks, but conflict doesn't seem to be that benefical in the game itself. This is a bit odd. Otherwise I like the different paths that players can take. Also, the multiplayer 4 hour format is great although this game suffers a bit from Catan-syndrome: The game ends when it really starts to be fun.

Reminds me of Conquest of Paradise. This is a fairly easy game to learn. I would say that Stone age has a similar learning curve.

I'm just bad at these 4X games, but they are fun nonetheless. In any moderately-sized game, someone will undoubtedly be beat down, which sucks as being crushed for 3 hours is generally something I like to avoid. Success is somewhat defined by luck of the draw.

Game is amazing.  While it is a very heavy game... that is only because of how broad it is.  Every mechanic is relatively simple and well thought out... there are just so many of them (and different ship upgrades) that this game is best played by experienced gamers.  It's a longer game but a lot of fun.  Some people find missiles to be an issue but they were addressed in expansions or could be house ruled if necessary (my house rule is people can fire one salvo of their lasers at the missiles and each hit blows up one missile.)

It was good to finally play the game. But unlike Civilization or Game of Thrones, one person managed to not have any contact with the other four! So they stole a victory building up monoliths with everyone else fighting for control of the rest of space!

Many choices, a lot of random elements.
It is a extraordinary civ game with many chances to individualise your tech which could be played in a short time.

But somehow I isn't fun to play for me. Sometimes I think the random drawing of space-tiles can slow down or speed up development quite a lot. And if you don't get any ressources you don't have a chance to keep up with the other players.

I don't like the high focus on military development/hard direct conflict / cold war atmosphere. I would like to know wheter a player - once successfully attacked - has still the chance to recover or even to win.

If I have to choose: would prefer Terra Mystica.

Stunning for what it is!  How do you design a game that lasts 3+ hours and yet keeps players riveted?  This way.  You need to make decisions about once every 5 minutes even with 6 players.  Most games suffer from extended periods where there is nothing for each player to decide on.  Brilliant work here.

The best 4X/civ game I've ever played.  Truly a masterpiece of that genre -- just awesome in every way, and great fun to play.  The variability among the available races, the delicious euro-ish resource management, the tech advancements, the space battles, the exploration, the ways in which you advance and develop your civilization... just wow.

This is not my type of game. I can appreciate its design, however. Although this is a totally theme-driven, AT game, Eclipse has definitely taken some nuances from European games. The biggest influence seems to be streamlining elements of the game, and a limitation on the actual length of the game. A bag draw for VPs punishes early turtling.I found the simplification of the tech tree interesting as well. Again, not my bag, but definitely a good game. 

The more I think about it, the more I think, from a design and gamer's-demand stand point, this may be one of the best games I've ever seen.

This is the best 4x implementation I have seen in a board game to date.  The timing of the turns feel right, the empire versus actions feels right, combat feels right.

Missiles aren't as "i win" as everyone says.  however, counters need to be known amongst players.

What I like about Eclipse is that the rules are relatively easy to grasp and it's not fiddly. Yet within this ruleset, there's enough options to consider and enough tactical variations to employ. Nice if you like getting into planning tech and customising ships.

The game goes up to 6 but I think it will play a lot better with fewer players. First, less downtime (which is still an issue here with 6). Second, there's more room to really get into the 4X aspect of the game. With 6, there isn't much eXplore before you get to the eXterminate!

Overall, a game I enjoy playing but if part of the appeal of space games is the theme, then Eclipse shares a problem with non-famous settings space games. It's cool to play a Star Wars or Dune game because of the setting but you're not going to get the same kick with Eclipse.

This is the first game I have played that has truly replaced another game for me.  I don't really see any reason to bring out TI3 again.

RATING: 9
Every action in Eclipse must be considered carefully because Eclipse is primarly about resource management.

Eclipse finds the balance between its elements. Resource management is critical but intuitive. Technology is great fun but does lean towards ship parts. Ship design is satisfying without being complicated.

Combat is enjoyable but not essential. There are enough Ancients (NPCs) on most maps to give players a chance to earn points without fighting eachother... if they do not want to. I really enjoy having the option of not being aggressive, though in games with five or more players things do get crowded and you may feel forced to.

Concerns are few. Combat VP has a large influence on most player scores, and 'lucky draws' can make the end result a surprise. I've noticed a tendency to avoid inter-player combat until late in the game, but this may just be that everyone wants their ships to be as 'awesome' as possible before engaging.

One of the greatest things about Eclipse is its play time. This is a 4X game I can actually get other people to play. If you have a group that is resistant to highly involved and complex games, you can convince them to play Eclipse... and they will thank you for it.

RATING: 5
I'm not the target audience for Eclipse, but I thought it was a pretty good euro. The economy/action board is interesting in how you decide to use your resources each turn or save them up. Deciding on which techs to take is a lot of fun, and they give you a kajillion to choose from; this is tech tree heaven for people that like that sort of thing. You can make some interesting spaceships to complement your strategy. I shifted from extra defense to extra initiative/offense which helped me win a decisive battle on the last turn and tilt the victory my way. That felt very satisfying, and seems like it will be different every game. 

I heard that the game rewarded you for conflict and not turtling, but seems to me that you want to turtle until turn 9. In our game, the guy who went into the center on turn 8 put a big ol' bulls eye on his back and was torn to shreds on the last turn like the unfortunate object of a piranha feeding frenzy. Seems like you're better off creating alliances with neighbors b/c the benefit is just too good and keeping things quiet until the last turn when you decide how to best bust your move. That's what I did anyway. I'm not sure why I'd want to attack someone before turn 9; seems like I can just attack aliens and get my VP tiles from them.

My Twilight Imperium, blissfully shorter. The game plays smoothly, has lots of choices and strategies if slightly less interactive beyond the obvious dice rolling. I see a lot of plays in the future once the naysayers actually play it...

Both of the games I've played so far when somebody was the Planta, they dominated the game.  It's too easy to wall yourself off with careful tile placement.

RATING: 7.5
I have to play it more in order to be able to judge it adequatly.
As of now, I think its rating is between a 10 and a 9.
It is beginner-friendly, balanced, streamlined, elegant and it offers a huge gameplay diversity.
I think there are only a couple of minor flaws (the fact that there are some vital ship upgrades that require technology being the worst), but it really has the potential to be considered perfect.

One sidenote: I don't think it can be compared to Twilight Imperium.
Aside from theme, they don't have much in common.






Upgrade: vote goes down from 9 to 8

After many plays, I have to say it didn't "age" as well as I thought.
I have three main concerns about this game:

It is entirely based on economic power; tactical play is completely absent and the strategical element is relegated to economical planning.
Money (thus actions) is by far the most important resource: it does not only allow you to sustain a bigger empire, bolstering your science and materials output, but also makes up for inferior tech on your ships, allowing you to effectively swarm and pin enemy forces.

The combat system: it is based on technological might rather than the number of ships (this is something I can live with) but more disappointing is the fact that, again, it is economy who makes and breaks your game: the upgrade mechanic is designed so that being able to perfect counter your opponents' ships means you can score crushing victories over them; thus being able to upgrade perfectly your ships and react to your opponents' upgrades will prove the most effective strategy to win space battles in Eclipse.

Finally, I think this game has not a replay-value as high as one might think seeing some of his features: highly differentiated alien races, random available technologies, modular hexagon-shaped board etc.
I think this is mostly due to the fact that the game dynamics all revolve around the same mechanics, thus even if some variables change, the game feels very much the same.

After all, in my opinion, Eclipse is a very good game with many strong suits (I like the VP-scoring system and exploring mechanics the most) but it is a space-themed economic ("euro") game, definetly NOT a cross-over euro-amerithrash or a 4X game: its core dynamics make optimization and neat economical play the most important aspects; no fighting, no negotiating with other players and the likes.

The change in my rating reflects the fact that I think it does not offer as much variety as I originally thought.

RATING: 2
To be clear, I don't think the game is poor - for years I thought it was a very good game - but I am done playing it. Rating objectively, I put this at an 8; my desire to play it is now a 2 - after 28 plays, I don't want to play it ever again.

JAN 2018 - I've done with this game. It gave me a lot of good plays, and had appeal enough to get friends to be excited about it, but after 25 plays or so, I just don't find it fun anymore. Sitting through other players' battles can provide drama and amazing beat-the-odds results, but it's also time consuming and frequently uninteresting to non-combatants. I also don't like the tendency of my plays to have no combat till halfway through the game; and the slow crawl through the techs to tweak your ship for battles has just become rote. Nothing here is really the fault of the game, but after 25 plays, I'm just not interested in exploring the game any further, even with expansions.

Played 22 times (mostly 2p, also 3p & 4p) for 48.0 hours.

JUN/13 - Strong mix of Euro systems and Ameritrash theme-based mechanics. I initially gave this a 10, but on a second playing bumped down a notch to a 9. As I was playing, I found the admittedly well-balanced resource system to be such a large part of the focus of the game that the game experience felt too Euro (read system heavy) for my desire for a theme-heavy game.

I think a $15 expansion that consisted of a deck of 60-100 encounter/event cards would turn this game from a 9 to an 11, and make it my favorite game ever. (Just looking at the first large expansion makes me think the Hive ships and new player mats would make for a 10-rated game).

JUL 2013. Still incredible game design. I just want a bit more theme in the way of non-player alien encounters and other events. That would nicely supercede the focus on the resource engine that drives so much of the game.

MAY 2014: Still a solid 9 for me. better with more players, obvs. 

JUN 2014: Last play was only an 8 for me, but it was a combination of being tired, getting unlucky with early tile draws (Ancient hexes and a Draco neighbour), and having to teach the game to new players...again - which I find exhausting. In general, my enjoyment of the base game is an 8/9 depending on the group, and a 9/10 with the expansion.

22nd play: :star::star::star::star::nostar: DEC/14: I like the game with 4p, but Alliances have to be banned right now for us - 2 players with the best ship designs banded together to steam roll the other two of us, and is was distinctly less fun. Also, after the game ended, we removed the 7-9p techs out - they add too many power techs.

Great Game! love every aspect of it.
Likes:
-exploration
-alien races with asymmetric powers
-tech tree and upgradable ships
-graphic design is amazing and easy to understand
-space battles are intricate and mean something
-winner or loser you get some points for battles
-getting points is obvious (thanks to the graphic design)and remains a key focus throughout the game!
-Smooth Gameplay. Means plays really fast. Expect a play of 4 players first time to go 4-5 hours.  But experience players can play 2-3 hours. 6 players may still take 3-4 hours.  

what others may say because of luck that I see their point but don't totally agree with: 

-exploration draws are too random
(you can choose to keep the hex or not. wasting an action.)

-hexes are random with resources and ancient ships
(they are but if you played it more than once or looked further, brown hexes are more common in spaces further from the center as well as less ancients) 

-hexes on the third hex are empty.
(they most likely have a discovery that you may use or keep 2vp that no one can take from you)

-I am surrounded by ancients
(ancients may slow you down. but they are good hexes to take over because of the battle vp's and discovery tokens. +now your ships are most likely are built up to dissuade others from attacking you right away)

-Dice combat to random
1) techs offer you full customization to beat up ancients from almost round 2-3. Adding a computer, a shield, more cannons, and putting some extra hulls to beef up your ships.  Yes there is variability, but you can make your ships almost never miss if you have a couple +2 computers on board.  

2) Combat is not the only way to win the game. some combat is good. Vp's are won for winning or losing, and destroying ships.  Everyone wins in a way!

-Random tech draws
1)Knowing 1st player has a clear advantage to pick the tech that became available.
2) knowing you can not bank on a tech popping up to completely keep the same strategy.
3) Missed this the first 10+ plays.  before you pick your race in the beginning of the game the first techs are displayed on the board so you can plan a little more in advance.

If you played once and don't like something I think you should try it again. Unless you completely hate luck you should try and play 2-3 times to understand the concepts and learn how to play more tactically verse strategically. This game has so much depth and rewards more excitement and strategic potential each play thru.  A solid 10!!!

Favoloso.
Preferisco il fantasy alla fantascienza ma questo gioco ha conquistato me e sopratutto tutti i partecipanti al mio gruppo.
Profondo e lungo al punto giusto da diventare a tratti epico.

L'unica cosa che non mi piace è il sistema di pesca dei punti e l'ordine dei turni di gioco che andrebbe migliorato con un apposito segnalino per capire chi è stato il primo a girare il cartoncino del turno di primo giocatore.
Le astronavi potevano essere curate decisamente molto meglio.Il resto del materiale è carino.
Ma ripeto che si soprassiede a tutto perchè il gioco risulta comunque ottimo.
Alcuni aspetti citati sono peraltro sistemabili con house rules ma per queste 3 cosucce gli do "solo" 9.5.
Splendido e consigliatissimo.

I gave this an 8 because its a good, expansive game on par with Axis and Allies.  Given the choice between the 2 I'd probably play A&A, but this is still a good game.

Reevaluated to a 5 since I haven't placed it since, so it must not be that good.

Christmas 2011.

Fascinating game, this is.  There are some very neat ideas going on in this game.  It's pretty simple to understand, and plays reasonably fast for a 4x space game.  I've now taught this game to several people and have played at least 10 games now.  Good game.

I'm obviously a huge fan of Twilight Imperium III and don't agree that this game replaces TI3.  They both have a place in my collection.  If I want an immersive experience, TI3 is still my favored choice.  TI3 offers a lot more choices every game and leaves you with a feeling of having played something epic.  My wife still prefers TI3 (I know -- that's awesome).

I acknowledge that Eclipse is fresh and clever and plays very quickly.  It's a great game.  And I'll play it more often, for now for sure.  It's easily a choice for me over other medium-length games to play.

The more I play this game the more I recognize the cleverness of the design and nuances of play.

I am truly shocked at how popular this game is. I was very disappointed by what seemed like an overly combat focused game, with a pretty weak combat system. It's very unlikely I'll play this again, even though after a single play (in which I was resoundingly defeated, despite the experienced player talking about how far ahead I was) I think I would be in a position to absolutely crush someone who's never played.

If you like the usual 4x fare and you like "barely get your engine going before the game ends" Euros, then you'll be in heaven here.  I'm not a direct, multiplayer-conflict fan, so this isn't one I'll suggest.  Still, there doesn't seem to be anything all that new here so I'm a little surprised by how ga-ga everyone is over this thing.

I love a lot of aspects of Eclipse, but it somehow feels less than the sum of its parts. I think its the combination of a long play length (always 3 hours due to some AP prone members of my group) and the investment I get in building an engine, only to have it get smashed by a player that just had better hex pulls and dice rolls.

Ultimately, it's a combination of a lot of things I like, but in all the wrong ways.

Eclipse is a very elegant design: one gets the feeling that in the hands of most designers, there would have been twice the rules to produce the same effect. There are multiple paths to victory, and while some defensive strength is almost always necessary, going on the offense against other players is not absolutely required. One can see elements of Through the Ages and Hansa Teutonica in the design, but the heart of this game is all about customizing ships, exploring new worlds, and doing battle.  An amazing mix of Euro-style economics and action-selection, and good-old fashioned American combat.  The only reasons I don't rate it higher are that it may be a little longer than it should be, and there is a little more luck in the balance than exists in my very favorite games.

RATING: 4
Eclipse could have been one of the best game.
But it is far too random. Why for hell should we draw a random map, take our technologies randomly and even drawing a random number of victory points after winning a combat...
The problem is that, when all the tiles are drawn, if you are unlucky, you can be blocked almost forever. It's in that kind of game when the losers play 5 minutes while some can play during 20 minutes... just boring.
But remember, the victory is also random, and you can finish 2nd after losing all the game.
But that's the drawbacks. Eclipse is still a nice civilization game and the idea that the number of actions you have depends on how much you pay is nice. I would advise the pre-draw the board or find some rules to avoid randomness.

This game has achieved what TI3 set out to do, without compromising the flow or structure of the game. What TI3 has that this doesn't is better components, a bit more flavour and a mechanism to artificially force the game closer to a conclusion.

There is room for improvement; at times the game feels too restrictive, and combat can be a little slow. Nevertheless, this is a solid 9 and I look forward to the expansion!

I still feel i got a little screwed for exploration tiles at the start but agree that i didn't accommodate it as well as i should.  it did seem though that if you had particularly bad exploration (first two explorations had double ancients) and someone else had a good draw (good ancient tech and 8 currency on first two explorations) then it could be very hard to catch up with them again unless they pulled terrible tiles as well.  and i never had a single resource planet in my zones, so had to rely on spending vast quantities of cash to build everything..

This is my favorite game. I will play this one any chance I get. I like all the little details. I love the deep strategy element. In this game you must also have an adaptive strategy. I love the theme and mechanics. I like to play the races with different abilities.

My only issues is the resource pieces are so small and the dice and combat pulls can have profound impacts on an otherwise well executed strategy. With 6 players this turns into a 3-4 hr game (which is okay for me but others may be turned off by it). Also, diplomatic relations are important but I feel llike this particular mechanism can/should be expanded.

Also there is a slight race balance issue as the Eradani are handicapped but there is an easy way to solve the problem don't pick the Erandi as your race (unless you want a Challenge and bragging rights but you were warned). 

Finally, I would not recommend this game for casual players. I would recommend this game for its theme and its strategy elements.

Based on one six player game. Very smooth gameplay but bad strategy can shut you down and lead to a very static and boring game. In this one, a single player abusing missiles completely screwed up a couple of players. The missile strategy didnt give him victory but the lack of good countermeasures made it a very boring game for some. In short: good but overrated.

RATING: 5
Pretty good but the lack of a thematic goal (i.e. that the victory is "most VP after round X") limits the playing appeal. It would be better with open, thematic goals such as "have X % of total population", "control Y number of systems" and "research Z advances".

It's also too slow for what it gives. If it had been playable in 1/3 of the time it would have been great. Right now it's only mediocre for me.

It's better with fewer players though.

Is Eclipse the revolution of the 4X genre? Nah, not really. What it is, though, and it's true that this sets it apart from quite a lot of the competition, is a very well-developed game. The mechanisms mesh very well, it all makes thematic sense, and handling is still reasonably simple even with a perceived gazillion of counters (quite possibly because the designer wasn't afraid to incorporate a number of Euro-like features; a Euro, however, this ain't even though it uses lots of wooden cubes).

That the game takes less than a fortnight to play is commendable but unless you look at space operas only that in itself isn't too much of an innovation. At the end of the day what we have here is a game that competently dodges some of the typical implementation issues in 4X games but still carries with it the basic challenges of multiplayer conflict games, for good or bad.

Love the ship-building aspect of the game.  It creates a host of tactical options which are fun to explore.   My reticence about the game is that it seems somewhat rote for the opening turns, you spend a lot of game time establishing your empire in a multiplayer solo mode before you get to the meatier interactive part of the game.

Update:  Started playing the various races, very interesting how different races promote different strategies.  A few races promote turtling strategies, which has the unfortunate side effect of lowering interaction.

In the beginning of the game, your fate can be highly influenced by the discorery tiles you take. Start next to ancients and you'll have a hard time, because you do not have the required strength to defeat them yet, while other players are getting tiles with free resources and research.

After that, you spend hours setting up your economy and ships for the great conquest, and when you think are fine to go... the game ends. Then, each player counts how many random VP chits had been taken during the game an sum up with the rest of points. That's it.

In the other hand, the ship upgrades are awesome, and with the economy they're the best parts of the game. They're not enough to make me wish to play it again, though.

It is one of the most anticlimactic experiences I've already had with a board game. I had the highest expectations about it, but it was such a disappointment to me. Fortunately, I had the opportunity to try before buying this expensive game.

If you wish to play an EPIC space empire civilization game, play Twilight Imperium instead. Do not believe this game is like TE, because it is not. I am not saying the theme is pasted on (it is a very thematic game IMO), I just mean that the only resemblance between the two games is the theme. Some people say Exodus Proxima Centauri offers similar experience of TI3 in less time, but I've not played it yet and so can not comment on this.

As I alread said, the technologies and economic mechanisms are great, but there are too many other (best) euros with great economy and much less randomness than this game.

I have always wanted to play Eclipse- love space, space battles, exploration, etc. I've sorta slumbered through the iPad app without really ever getting a sense of what to do. Read the rules and watched videos and still didn't get a sense of the clear objective here other than "get points". Eclipse's largest strength is that sort of sandboxy, infinite ways of customization- good, good ideas. Allows for great replayability and all under 4 hours. For all of its rules, it's fairly straight-forward and it only takes one play of it to really get a sense of what's going on. I'm sure 4 players who have a good sense of what's going on would have a real good time here.

I don't think Eclipse is for me. It has some mechanics that I really do not enjoy. For a game with lots of decisions to make, the randomness of VP tokens and exploration tiles can certainly direct this game. Not a terrible thing as there are players who love having to deal with random occurrences on the fly and I'm certain players with skill can handle this. I would not accuse Eclipse of being chaotic or unfair. In fact, it's a very fair game considering the randomness. But when it's not being overly random it has that: "the rich get richer and the poor die trying" factor that pretty much gets established in the first hour of the game. I think games that make you really stretch your resources can easily fall into that trap. It absolutely creates tension, but this tension can easily boil into frustration. In fact, a member of our game went bankrupt, but pretty much put himself in that situation after realizing an hour before the game was over that there was no getting out of the dire predicament that he had been put in after a devastating attack from an opponent.  And I knew that no matter what I did, there was no stopping one player. This is okay, really: great Eclipse players should be able to see when a player is getting overpowered and they can sort of "truce" together and take down the leader. That didn't happen in our game which unfortunately set the tone of our game for the rest of the night.

I'm also not a fan of the combat system, which feels rather uninspired and is just another rehash of a dice-chucking combat system with modifiers. Again, that can be okay given the right game but I would have expected something a little more unique and intriguing given all the physical beauty of Eclipse.

Best points? The rulebook. One of the best written.  The examples could have been a bit clearer but otherwise this is how a rulebook should be written.

To summarize: Eclipse is a good game. A very good game, actually.  It's just not a very good game for me.  Though I'd be willing to try it with less players in a quieter setting and see if that changes my enjoyment. Certainly knowing the game a bit better would have  positive effect.

My favorite 4X game around. The ship customization is amazing in this game and a lot of the enjoyment is from developing your ships. A lot of exploiting to be had if you get a powerful combination of technology 

The exploring in this game is slightly better than normal, sometimes you get screwed by the tiles but I like that you can form connections between spaces and the rewards for inner ring/outer ring tiles.

Balancing your resources is important in this game and can be quite a puzzle in management. The game has a lot of the epic feelings of space 4X games while not being as long so it's easier to get it to the table. Ending the game after a certain number of rounds was a good way to make the game not drag and force people into action

I have to say I was surprised as I've seen plenty of other games do the same idea but usually fall short, i.e.- to much to keep track of later in the game, early player elimination. It's almost sure that you will have some conflict the last couple of turns on par with Small World so if you know people that can't handle that you probably won't like the game. I ding it only 1 point for too much randomness.

After playing other peoples copies of Eclipse a number of times, I was compelled to buy my own copy and collect the important set of expansions and promos. Eclipse sets a new standard for “4X” games, particularly because it is playable in an evening with a full player count. If you are in the mood to Explore, Expand, Exploit and Exterminate this will scratch that itch. It is an excellent example of a Euro / Ameri-trash Hybrid that leans toward Euro, with a little dice-chucking combat luck that can be mitigated by the players. It does an excellent job of translating the theme onto a game board – you really feel like you are exploring space and expanding your galactic empire. 

My only complaint: this game has the "three player problem" so don't play it with three.  Also, I'm not fond of the large space battles that tend to occur late in the game and just drag it on and on.  So, my rating reflects that.

Played for the first time on 30/12/2014 with just the base game and 6 players. It took roughly 3.5 hours and while it was overall quite fun, it started to drag towards the very end of the game with most players getting bored and easily distracted.

I would happily play Eclipse again with a lower player count, not sure I would want to play at 6 players again unless everyone had several games worth of experience under their belt.

One of the best & most elegant systems around in a space combat/exploration/economic game. It's shorter playtime, puts it far ahead of competitors like TI3, even though comparisons to TI3 are understandable. As long as gamers know that this is first an economic game first, and a space exploration & battle game second, then Eclipse can be received and experienced in such a way that is deeply satisfying. If you want in-your-face combat games in space, there are a plethora already to chose from. Not too much downtime since there's enough to plan for. There can be enough negotiation as well, depending on players. Far better than Exodus, IMO- mainly because it feels far more satisfying to attack other planets with ships, than simply send rockets (from planets) to do so, and your fleet size is not as limited (as in Exodus).

Initial rating after one play. I waited along time to finally play this. My first experience with Eclipse was fun but a bit confusing. The theme comes across very well. I like many of the solutions they chose, but I think there is a bit too much unnecessary randomness (the prestige points you get after destroying an alien ship). I'm eager to play it more.

9.0 after 1st play, 4 players with human races
7.0 after 2nd play, 5 players with human races
5.5 after 3rd play, 6 players with alien races

Fine game mechanics indeed, but the VP system IMHO is broken. Played with 4, 5, 6 players. Every play ending like a Twilight Imperium's weapons race for Mercatol Rex.
The combat system turned out to be a very dice fest, particularly in the the final turns, when all the spaceships get stuffed with every available cannon, turret, missile, etc.
The VPs won for combat results are way too overbalanced vs. VPs gained for research.
Exploring a new tile is almost a matter of luck.
In the last two plays we ended with about 20 points between the first and the second player.
End of 3rd game: 42, 26, 25, 21, 21, 16 pts.


All this make me feel very disappointed by a 4 hours game which I put on my wish list since I returned from Essen.

A very good 4x game with a decent space theme. I would have liked to give it a higher score and after my first game I probably would have but I simply find this one quite hard to get to the table. It's lengthy, the components are a tad fiddly and at times it does feel more like accounting than a space opera.

It is however very very fun just maybe not the classic BGG has it currently hyped as.

I was concerned that I might not like this, because superficially it resembles games with a lot of "incidental complexity" and unnecessary learning curves, traits which I do not favor.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that Eclipse is actually *not* a complex game; the rules are straightforward, the iconography is helpful, the combat is streamlined, and the number of actions to consider on any given turn is quite limited due to scarcity of resources.  There are a lot of bits, but I wouldn't describe it as "fiddly".

The variety of alien powers are interesting.  This should have good replay value.

It's not the second coming of gameinghood or anything, but it's a super-tight and well-designed game that takes a lot of the fun and theme of a slog like TI3 and simplifies it until the game can actually be completed in a game night.

I wasn't entirely pleased with the luck of combat token draws, and I do see missile technology as being quite un-fun (although not broken), but overall this game is very well done, and I know I'll be playing more of it with my group.

Design is wonderfully streamlined, and accomplishes a lot rather elegantly.  After two plays, however, the game hasn't really pulled me in.  Seems like the game is somewhat scripted in going from exploration to research, to battles, and it's just a matter of timing as to when you move from one phase to the next.  Furthermore, the exploration draws seem to shape your decisions as you have to react to what's available.  This may grow on me, but as it stands, I'm a little hesitant on it's strategic depth.

A mix between american and german games. A solid part of management resources and technologic advancements, with an intense use of dice in combats... 
Even exploration has an high degree of luck in turning exagons. Being an hybrid it should be appreciated by most players, even if the purists of both faction could find it too random (eurogamers) or too cold (ameritrashers).
IMHO Eclipse is a very good 4X playable in 3 hours and that's why most people like it.

A rock solid 8 out of 10, still need a few more plays to see how much luck is involved in winning, superficially most of the gameplay seems deterministic, the combat though with dice is not chaotic, but its difficult to assess the affect of the hexes revealed near the player and the way the technology gets revealed and the way combat VP points are gained and how these affect victory.  I like the pace of the game 9 turns is just perfect for a big finish!

Not my sort of thing. Though I can see why others might find Eclipse a supernova of a game. It's good for what it is, but if I'm chucking dice like this, I'd rather just play a wargame. Or old school AT like [thing=97][/thing]. Frankly, I find little joy in either "leveling up my stuff" or "obsessing over ledger board bookkeeping".

In short, Eclipse is a cheap slut of a game. It's got boring coming and going -- big long spreadsheet in the mouth and buckets of dice nonsense pounding up the ass.

RATING: 7
Interesting space exploration game, reminds me of Through the Ages crossed with The Phantom League.  Is long - hopefully will speed up some as we play more. You have to be accepting of some hefty luck randomisers (dice, space finds) and the play length (and combat) but it plays well and the mechanics integrate smoothly.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Very good euro/risk wargame - combines resource management and VP conversion with typically Risk like attacking and area control. Additionally the euro aspect of the game allows you to develope your ships to emphasise speed, strike power, to hit capability of defense, as well as your VP scoring capability - very good. There is however a considerable luck element in the turn of the planets you explore and a bad turn early in the game can severly set you back. 

Components are excellent and very functional with possibley the best player boards ever.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Fairly nice components...though they are not as nice as TI3, and I paid more for this. (not by much. :))

The rules have a few interesting ways of handling things like upkeep and technology tracks, which simplify some of the more tedious parts of the whole epic space-empire genre. There are a lot of icons and colors to remember as well.

The games theme isn't very unique but it works and it shines through in the gameplay. I do get the feeling of building a space empire, exploring, and upgrading ships.
Battles kind of fall flat, there isn't anything clever about them...roll some dice, compare some numbers, things explode...meh. I do worry about everyone jumping on the missile boat! The game may become scripted where the first few turns will automatically be geared towards building up defenses once someone starts investing in them!

Is this the holy grail of space games? Without hesitation: No. 
It is a good effort though, and I'd say it bridges that gap between Galactic Emperor and TI3.

My rating for this may go up or down with more plays...games like Ascending Empires come out that REALLY simplify what we're expecting from these space games. I see similar empire/tech growth in every one...the only thing that changes is the depth and specificity of choices available. Sometimes I think the only way we can REALLY get that epic space game feel...is to play the epic space games on the computer.

RATING: 5
The good:
1. customizable ships
2. streamlined design makes gameplay very straight forward
3. easy to teach and new players are not at a huge disadvantage

The down side:
1. Virtually no diplomatic or political system whatsoever
2. The wormhole system is absolutely terrible and allows people to turtle with virtually no way of countering it.
3. Very minimal interaction resulting from scripted and finite game turns. On turns 1-3 you almost exclusively explore. On turns 4-6 you kill neutrals and expand as much as possible. On turns 7-9 you maximize points and plan your final, and often only, assault on neighbors to grab some extra VP.
4. Besides how to outfit your ships, there are really no difficult decisions to make since all your turns are essentially scripted.
5. Due to the above reasons, low interaction, no diplomacy, scripted decisions, etc. this game is simply not epic. It is a mediocre euroy version of a space 4x game that sacrifices everything that makes a game an epic 4x game to streamline its mechanics. Unfortunately in doing so it also takes out all the complexities, strategy, diplomacy, and other interactions that make a 4x game fun to play. You are left with an efficient sort of engine building type 4xer without any of the teeth that draws me to the genre. The great parts about the game, like the customization of ships, are simply overshadowed by the dullness of the gameplay. I will play it again if others want but it is largely uninteresting albeit a smooth design.

RATING: 6.2
This game is a light version of Twighlight Imperium 3.  It has all the same problems:  too long for what it offers, lots of luck in revealing new locations and combat and combat rewards; and a new problem of very little player interaction.  The game is polished and those who don't mind a lot of luck and very little player interaction in their space games might like it but I didn't.

Edit:  After playing another game (about a year later) I found I enjoyed it a bit more than the first time and so bumped my rating from a 5.5 to a 6.2.  It still has a lot of luck but that goes down a bit once you understand what the odds are of you drawing different types of Type I,II,III systems as well as the impact of the different technologies.

I think I wanted to like this game too much, because I've never been more disappointed in a game.  It has great ideas, ok components, but in the end it's a 4 hour luck fest, where good tile draws trumps any amount of strategy.  I don't mind randomness, but not when it's going to take all afternoon and the points are all hidden.  The ending and scoring can be fairly random which can mean the person who played the best wins.

After more plays I appreciate the game more, but still think it needs some rules customization to make it play well.

One of our favorite 2 hour games, and the only "4X" game in our collection.  We are both science fiction fans, so the theme resonates with us.

Just one game under my belt, and I cant properly rate it yet, just an estimative nine that could be a 9.5 or a 8.5 after some more games. Anyway, this is a really good game and one of the best designs of the last three years. It is playable under the four hours time for five players without AP. It has many nice elements, resource management, combat, interaction: a sort of eurogame disguised in an ameritrash that works very well in both euro and ameritrashers gamers groups. May be is not a top five in my list, but it is a fantastic design. I hope to play it more in the upcoming months in order to decide its final rate, and I cant wait to Essen 12 new expansion. So far, so good, but I must play it more times.

RATING: 10
I have played a lot of Civ games over the years and this is by far my favorite in both the physical and digital realm and it only gets better with expansions.  It meets that sweet spot of complexity without really slowing down the game.   I do enjoy more complex games such as TI3 but they come at a cost of trying to find a play group that wants to sit down for 8+ hours for one game.  But I can get a lot of the same highs from eclipse in almost half the play time due to some really elegant game design in some areas and trimming back some complexity in areas that don't really harm the game.

 
Plays spectacular with 3-4, starts to get a little long in the tooth at 5-6  and I have never been brave enough to try the 9 player cap that the expansion adds because that would be a lot of down time between turns. I have enjoyed 2 player games but at least in the core game it can feel like you have a fairly clear winner by about the half way point.   The expansions help fight this back by adding more goals to reach for that do not come via direct conflict with other players. 

If I had to give it one con it's that its set up can be a bit of a slog if only because there are so many pieces to this game. 


I have owned the game for about 3 years now and it is till one of our top go to games to pull out even after all this time. I can't recommend this game enough if you like big sprawling civilization type games.

Initially, I did not like this game too much because it felt too short, in terms of number of turns.  By the time your empire is humming along, the game is over.  This happens if everyone turtles or proceeds too cautiously.

To really make this game fun, people have to fight early and often.  My rating rose once this realization hit.

Reading through the rules tonight and hopefully getting in a 2-player game before bed!

Update: Wow! We had so much fun, just with 2 players and with neither of us knowing the rules. My girlfriend is completely unfamiliar with 4X games, and even she loved it - we both stayed up way past our bedtime to finish because we were that invested in what was going on.

As everyone's said, the mechanics are beautiful. Complex calculations and concepts are made simple through the design of the game. But most importantly, this game really gets the 4X feeling down. There are tons of decisions to make - each turn gives you such a variety of options, with deep and complex ramifications for each choice. I felt it in my gut the whole time, that special feeling you get from a really immersive, addicting and thoughtful 4X game, where the range of possibilities would be overwhelming if not for the grand strategy taking place.

Really good stuff, and that's with just one two-player game under my belt. Looking forward to more!

Edit: Played a 4 player game with 2 newbies, it was excellent. One guy went super-aggressive and conquered almost the whole galaxy, but the guy who was walled off in a corner building monoliths and slaying ancients still almost beat him. There were some tense attacks, counter-attacks and last-minute alliance breakings, and it all made for a supremely entertaining and satisfying conclusion to a long night of board games.

So much strategy.  This is an economic game first and foremost.  The mechanics of this game are excellent.  Easily 20-30 plays on this before I started recording games on BGG.

The economy of the game is by far the best part of the game for me.  Managing that portion of the game well is critical to winning the other portions of the game.  

While not the Epic Space Opera that is TI, this game FEELS that good to me and plays SO much faster.  Love it. 

If I am going to issue a complaint, then I must point out that sometimes the battles feel like a lot of dice rolling.  Not like Axis and Allies, but just saying.  I guess that is to be expected in a war game though.

Alot of build up and economy in this game. The battles are simple and easy. The rules are simple to pick up. Things can easily not go your way in this game. Resoureces! War! Diplomacy! I prefer playing this with at least 4 people because of the diplomacy aspect. Dracos seems a little cheap to play as in a 3 person game. 
Also a negtive note, it takes awhile to set up

Additional note, even though the rules are easy, their is alot to explain :p
additional note 2: I have not played twilight imperium or exodus, and I've heard once you play these you never go back...
Another note: finally played exodus, and it wasn't that fun. made me realize that eclipse was a better game than I gave it credit for being. I've upgraded it an 8. The reasons for not going above it is because of long set up time, complexity of the game makes it harder to teach, and the battle element reward system needs to be fixed. The op of the missiles used to be another reason, but it was kind of fixed with the expansion.

Very well designed board game with great components.  Affords a wide variety of play styles with its multiple paths to victory.

After a few plays, this felt too much like rock, paper, scissors. Except that each player knows who is playing rock, paper, and scissors. Battles are determined before they begin depending on who has which upgrades. And the strategy your opponent picks dictates what you should pick.

I do love the exploration and resource collecting system. The way the player board works with the expansion of your empire is brilliant. Unfortunately the problems above overshadow this brilliance and sours me on the game as a whole.

RATING: 7
A few years back, the light civilization game was a popular design goal. There have been many aspirants to the throne, but ultimately it is hard to do without trading some crucial aspects. This is a space exploration and conquering game in the same style as Twilight Imperium, but with much shorter play time and have less ambiguous rules.

There are no cards in the game and almost no secret information, which might make it less intriguing, but because of these decisions it wins on consistency, ease of play and game balance. The game feels streamlined and elegant, borderline clinical. In the beginning of the game, there is usually much exploration, but a few turns in it become highly interactive. You usually have to fight with the other races some time during the game because it gives a bunch of victory points, but not too much since you then easily neglect other goals. Balance is the key here. 

The question I query is if the game is fun in the long run and how replayable it is. The alien races are certainly different, but I can see that the openness does mean that there is not so much play of surprise. I generally like how the order system works where there are an upkeep to have many things and how much you have. The exception to this is late in the game, where it can become a chicken race in order to strike against the other players. I found the game a little bit lacking if all players play defensively. The game is good, but it doesn't always play out as well as it looks on paper.

That a defender can build a stack of ships and stations in a system under attack limits the appeal of offensive action. You can try to house rule or you can just make peace with the game, and accept it as a very good night of gaming rather than a competitively balanced contest (and that is where I am leaning). Despite its flaws, Eclipse instantly makes obsolete every other strategic space game in my library (and I've been playing them since Stellar Conquest back in 1974). That the game can be comfortably played to conclusion on a weeknight evening forgives many flaws. http://geekendforever.wordpress.com/2012/01/01/total-eclipse/

RATING: 7.5
Good strategy game in which you have to expand your interstellar civilization.  Surprisingly easy to learn for a game so deep and engaging.

On your turn you can : 
- Explore to add hexagon to the modular board and colonize it to produce more ressources
- Influence to take control or leave an hexagon (controling hex cost money but also give VP at the end of the game)
- Research new technology to have better upgrade for your ships, be able to build new things or gain other bonuses
- Improve your ships to increase their movement, attack power, defense, etc.
- Build to add your ships on the board
- Move to move your ships (and fight if occupy)

The winner is the player with the most victory point after the 9 round of play.
You get VP for every :
- Reputation tile received after battle
- Ambassador tile received when doing diplomatic relationships with other civilization
- Control hexs
- Monolith on control hexs
- Discovery tile received when taking control of an hex (by exploring most of the time)
- Technology track (the more you research, the more point you'll get)

You lose VP if you have the Traitor card (last player to attack a civilization with which he had a diplomatic relationship)

With all those way to score VP, There are many path to victory.

Sadly traded in a math trade :-(

Science! Fiction! Aliens! Space Ships! Economy! Aliens! 
Eclipse was one of the first games I bought. Unfortunately due to the fact that it doesn't play well with two and that I have no friends, it's been acting as a dust collector for quite a while. *Sigh*. I need to read more Alastair Reynolds.

Brilliant game!

This is what Twilight Imperium III should have been in the first place. The feeling of "epic" I found here, but unfortunately not in TI3. 

This is a great game, and a keeper. 

UPDATE
I played once again, and the EPIC feel is still there! 
Wonderful game! A solid "9" for now, and maybe going to become a "10" in the future!

UPDATE
I'll rate this -0.5, because it feels a little too random at the end of the day. Yet it is a great game. 

UPDATE
Damn this is the game everyone wants to play, and I really am getting annoyed by it. :|

I think I've played more than 10 games now, I wouldn't play a human race, but I'll explore the various alien races out there just to add a little variety. 

Even if I can't stand to play it at the rhythm I'm playing it now, I still believe it is a very well conceived game. This is a damn good game that you should buy now!

My problem with it is the same I had with Twilight Struggle and it is very hard to pinpoint, but roughly it goes this way: if I win or I lose in this game, I get no "kick" out of it. And I'm ultimately a tension addict. :D

It seems like a weird mix of Hansa Teutonica and TI shouldn't work, but it does. I'm coming to realize that I really enjoy games that harass you with luck, but then provide numerous strategies for pulling good luck from bad. This is a good example. Mine is a French Edition.

Update: There have been so many interesting, streamlined 4X games released in the last year or two, that this now feels a little more tiresome to set-up and play. Still a great game, but these days the answer to "wanna play Eclipse?" tends to be "how about Clash of Cultures instead?"

New Update: With expansions, this has developed a new life for me as my single-favorite two-player game. Rating raised.

Interesting 4X game about space exploration and conquer with streamlined mechanics and well designed iconography.  
Overall I liked it but I really wanted more interactions between players other than attacking each other's stuff. Politics, anticipation, excitement! This might be because I was playing the app so I'd like to play it with other people to see how different it is. 

I'm really not a fan of dice rolling to resolve combats, which is the main downside to me.

Note: Only played the iOS app. The original one looks like a pain to set up and tear down, but I want to eventually play it and compare.

I can't see this game taking anything less than a Very Long Time to play for my group, and thus its number of plays is going to be limited, but it's great. Really satisfying exploration/tech race/arms race/peow peow space opera stuff.

Update, Dec 2013: Flippin', flippin' lovely. My ideal game, really. Relaxed pace, a sense of building an empire, some unpredictability, but with tight Euro-y mechanisms. Despite being a fairly complex game, this just plays smoothly and intuitively. Playing opportunities are going to be limited due to the playing time, but that doesn't take anything away from the game's awesomeness.

Based on one 2 player game and three or four 5~6 player games. I love this way more then Twilight Emperium. Lots of choices and possibilities, which gives it a big learning curve, but with every play i get more efficient.

Only cons, setup time, too much fiddling with chits and the other a lots of exceptions or the occassional slipup in using the rules or forgetting about them. But that will probably will pass with more experience. Love to play!

RATING: 7
What am I missing?  I love 4X civ games and Eclipse ticks all the boxes.  Yet I have been left underwhelmed.  Losing a battle early on seems to be devastating so combat is avoided until the later rounds, where one or two encounters will determine the winner.  So, instead of the intense, conflict driven space drama I was hoping for I have on my hands a moderately engaging cube pusher.  OK, Kemet again?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
If you judge a game on the number of bits that you get then this is a real winner.  The concept of resource management is excellent and helps to prevent players from quickly running away with things.  The upgradeable ships are also very cool and an excellent element that livens up combat.

However, this game really relies on people knowing what they're doing.  More experienced players will wipe the floor with anyone new to the game and it can be a long slow death for those being beaten.

Also there's not much player interaction outside of combat.  The diplomacy is practically non existent, but what little there is doesn't really work.  2 Experienced players who start next to each other can just form an alliance and crush all before them.

Suffers from the same issues as most other 4X or civ-type games - randomness of exploring can give big advantages or disadvantages, which in the early game can make a huge difference. Plus any game with direct conflict like this can mean you can be ganged up on and/or taken out of the running and forced to play out the rest of the game with little to no chance of winning.

RATING: 6
After 3 plays, I'm just left with an underwhelming feeling.  I want to like this game more then I do, it's just... boring.  Build up for 7/8ths of the game, then try to smash you whomever is next to you on the last turn.  Combat with other players is generally the way to lose the game.  Just when you build that killer ship, you move it to invade your neighbor.  Your going clean his clock!  But on his turn he just magically upgrades all his ships.  So much for the attacker having any chance in combat.  Resume Turtling and explore until you find the overpowered ship upgrade.

Eurotrash at its finest!  Believe the hype!
I can't wait to get this one out at game night, even though the 2 player experience was superb.

a 10 rating after 2 plays, might be a little presumptuous, but seriously.  This game.  Seriously.
I'm sure that the complaints that some players have are quite legit, but so far, I haven't seen a single mechanic dominate too viciously to make it feel imbalanced.  Now I need to try the unique alien races!
---
7 plays later, I'm dropping the rating to an 8.  Not to imply I don't like the game still, it's just that the original excitement from the beauty of the mechanics has worn off a little and what I'm left with is a game that needs to be played pretty aggressively to be fun, and for some, that's not fun. Everyone wants to build up their little corner of the galaxy, and improve their ships, but you either have to fly in and decimate a weaker neighbour or take the disadvantage of being the aggressor against an equal.  With the right opponents, this can be very fun, but as it turns out, I'm just not really that type of gamer.

RATING: 6
It's an okay game, but I rather play these kind of games on PC like Master of Orion 2 or Endless Space for the younger people. Because what this board game is, is an attempt at reproducing these PC game classics on a table. It is playable and people can have a certain fun, but like I said, these kind of games are best on PC for me. I save lots of time because there are no dice rolls, no setup, no transportation irl, and so on. Just contact your friends, tell them to get on their PCs and play. It's just too long for the few turns you play. The game should have been bigger. Each time I have played, I had en empty feeling, not the feeling I have with games like Agricola where you want to play again.
Also, on PC, you don't need to spend a hundred dollars to buy the game.
I think this game is way overrated and over-hyped... it's not bad neither is it excellent, just the average game. What i think is many people never played games like Master of Orion 2 or Endless Space, and now that they have seen and played Eclipse, it's the game of the year or something. But in fact, it's an old idea from the PC put on your table but the design is much better than the last civilization from FF which was full of crap with lots of eye candy.

RATING: 9.5
I can understand how the reputation chit-pull can seem random and frustrating for some players.  I don't mind it because attackers have to realize they may be handing more VP to those whom they accost.  In the long run, the victims of aggression may have the greater reputation and become the Galactic leaders.
I find the limit on reputation chits you can keep an interesting system.  You are encouraged to fight, and fight early, to get good chits before others claim them, but warfare has diminishing reputation benefits later in the game, and the value of the hexes captured becomes more significant.
Economic system is excellent.
Graphic design is excellent.  I can see what I need to and it makes sense.
It is tricky to avoid accidentally upgrading beyond your ship's power supply capabilities.  It is good if players can watch what others are doing to avoid honest mistakes.

Interesting system design, and a bit less complex than might appear at first sight.

Do have a concern (based on limited play so far) that a player's ending position is too heavily influenced by a relatively small number of important "events" like sector tile draw (on explore) and fighting the ancients, not too mention if a player is on the receiving end of a sector raid. Especially if one of these happens early in the game, it appears that will permanently put that player's empire behind those that had better early luck. Yes, there are strategies, but it is a struggle just to try to keep up as the others move forward.

If it had a longer run time, that could even out. But having only 9 rounds in a 4X game seems too short to recover from "black swans" and/or launch a proper military campaign (especially without just being a kingmaker).

For that reason, I am thinking of this less as a serious planning game and more as a "Hollywood" game... lots of good looking parts and action, but not as much meat in the plot.

Still, at least it was fun to explore the game system and want to try it some more.
Folks seem to think very highly of this, but I need to play it a bit more to see why that is.

Preliminary rating after 2 plays with 4 players. 

Pros: wonderful game flow, elegant mechanics, theme fits gameplay almost perfecly.  Fun!  I especially like the research/update part.  

Cons: not yet sure about how I like the luck factor: random rolls with 1D6, random alien technologies which range from powerful to "meh", random drawing of victory tokens and last but not least random drawing of exploration tiles which can easily lead to one player having a head start while other players still struggle to get their third colony.

However, the game is reasonable short, especially probaly with 2 players so if you have bad luck you can go for a quick re-match.  I'm not sure if I want to play this game with 5 or 6 players though.

Take territory to gain resources to build things to help you gain more territory to get more resources to get more things and territory. An ok game, but it’s not something I’m going to go out and plan on playing. It did want me to pull out TI2 and try that one again.

I like this one as much as Scythe.  I bought Eclipse in 2013 and started playing the iPad version after it became available.  I "rediscovered" Eclipse in late 2017/early 2018 and fell in love with it ... even more so after discovering it's also available to play on Steam (identical to iPad version).  Perhaps the only drawback is that I've had a harder time getting female players to go for Eclipse.  It typically has more combat than Scythe, which may explain why.

4X de ambientacion espacial. 

En terminos jugables es una absoluta maravilla. incluye de todo y practicamente todo muy bien hecho y muy bien ajustado. conjuga mucha libertad de accion, un desarrollo relativamente rapido e imprevisibilidad en los combates. 

Tiene el clasico defecto de los juegos con mucho que hacer: que al principio nubla al jugador. 

Ademas lo complementa con unas calidades excelentes. lo unico que baja un poquito el conjunto es que la linea argumental es muy generica y los tableros de jugador de "carton de caja de cereales" cumplen, pero al juego le falta ese puntillo extra en "artworks" para ser absolutamente magnifico. 

Aun con ello el juego bordea los limites del Top5 lo cual es muchisimo decir. :)

Believe the hype.
This is the full 4X experience with no corners cut. It moves at a good clip, and does indeed not consume your entire day. It's easy to teach and grok, and it feels like a good Euro; until you get into a fight, when it feels like a good dice-chucker; and after the battle, even if you were obliterated, it feels like a good Euro again. Ship design, in particular, is inspired.
Well done, people. The circle has been squared.
[EDIT] It's still a masterwork of game design, but the disparity of the tile draws in the initial rush of exploration can be frustratingly determinative.

Great example of game design. Everything feels INTUITIVE; there are some great decisions to be made and so many choices. Daddy likes. At some point players really need to focus on what the strengths/weaknesses of each race are in order to exploit that FTW. 

I love that the centre hexes have more stars on them than the outer ones. When the board is 'built' it looks like a galaxy! Details like that show the amount of work that went into this game.

Does Eclipse have a 'plasma-missile' problem? I don't know. Perhaps it has an improved hull problem, which become all the more important if PMs are in play. There are so many good choices and so many who say that PMs are NOT overpowered that I don't worry about it at all.

Another game everyone talked about when it came out. Well, having a dice driven combat system is always a bad sign for me, so I put this one at the end of my list.

However, I played it by now and it may be a good game, but as usual, it cannot hold up with the hype. The combat system is something I can't stand at all, even though there are options to increase your chances. The luck of the draw when it comes to exploration is another mechanic I dislike, as this can change your whole game. If you get what you need, fine, but if not...

Eclipse is most definitely a space exploration civ game done right and one I've really enjoyed each play. There are big random elements that can screw you, while you'll be relying on other players to do the 'right thing' in certain situations (and their version of right may be very different fro yours), but win or lose I've had fun each time. The way resources etc are calculated is intuitive, exploration is sensibly random, while combat is brutal and dicey.

Absolutely brilliant design.  Lots of moving parts, but every aspect of the game is quite logical, easy to understand, and fits very nicely into the theme of the game.

Joc de conquista, exploració i tecnologia amb alguns elements de diplomacia. Bandols asimètrics (si es vol) i gestió de recursos típica d'eurogame. Mecàniques interesants i relacionades amb la temática, especialmente el track de discs d'acció (quan més gran és el teu imperi més costa de mantenir).

El sistema de punts de victoria pot resultar enganyós i costa saber qui va guanyant. A més, la forma de guanyar la partida és poc temática, no té res a veure amb si has desenvolupat bé el imperi o no. El combat està bonificat...

La partida s'acaba normalment quan està en el millor moment. L'atzar en el descobriment de losetas i en els daus pot ser molt determinant. Algunes tecnologies de descobriment poden ser massa decisives. L'estrategia dels missils és guanyadora.

So haven't been able to get this to the table and to be frank I'm not that into it anymore. There's just too much randomness in everything you do. Ameritrashers say it's too euro-y but for me it's way too Ameritrashy. I wouldn't object to playing it but at the moment Scythe scratches the same itch and does it much better.

RATING: 6
Euro mechanics that feed into a fun little ship building minigame are the core of the game, which is then completely irrelevant because the scoring is utter trash. The scoring incentivises you to avoid the bits of the game which are the most fun to use.

 Early fights, before you've played the ship building fun part, hand out loads of points. Big fights at the end between the upgraded, fun times ships hand out way less points, and the points for occupying sectors are measly. Endgame battles are so damaging that if you risk it, you're just leaving your battered fleet for someone else to swoop in on. Rinse repeat.

With a stunning amount of bits (900+), it sprawls over the table and requires a setup time to rival almost any other game. Yet Eclipse's gameplay is easy enough to grasp that, despite its long playing time, it can appeal to almost any gamer. 

Some of the mechanisms here work very well, particularly the action tracks. Placing pieces from your playmat onto the board not only shows which planets you have claimed, it also reveals higher-valued options beneath. Of course you will have to pay more for these as well, but that system works very nicely too. In fact, mechanically, the systems all work together seamlessly. There is a lot to admire in terms of the design. 

If Eclipse has a flaw in design, it may be lack of interaction. The eXterminate seems to be the weakest of the 4 X's here, as mobility towards other players is often limited, a problem that worsens with greater numbers of players. It can also tend towards an excessive amount of planning, not AP so much, but simply taking into account a lot of factors each turn. 

Ultimately, Eclipse somehow manages to feel both extremely accessible and extremely overwhelming. It's an experience that is worth having if you are in the right mood and you have the time, but it's not as quick or streamlined as I was hoping. Despite any misgivings I may have, this is one I'd love to own and would have a hard time turning down an offer to play.

My summary of this game is that it has too many dice battles for my taste.  Better than Risk, of course, but what isn't?  However, luck of the draw for bonus tiles is another random factor that is annoying... if a player wins the right advanced technology in early battles, that can give them the game (if they exploit it correctly).

It's important to get big warships out in play, as a deterrant as well as a way of attacking ancients.

Getting plasma missiles onto tiny ships seems to be a good strategy, although it's all luck of the dice roll if they will help.

  The combination of the large amount of player interaction and uniqueness within each game makes this a very strategic game.  So much that I actually might enjoy playing it solo better.  Hard to keep track of everything without dedicating a lot of time to practice.  On your first ten plays, you will think there is a lot of luck, but you will learn better.
   I didn't really start to like this game until about ten plays in.  The more you play the better you get.  
   Rulebook is great.  one of the best.
  
This civ. thing is not for me, though.  The first half of this game is boring and solitaire; the second half is just a play out of how well you did in the first half.  The tenseness is good, but Merchants and Marauders does the same thing better.

I somehow can't seem able to like this as much as I want to. After 3 plays I feel that the game ends too quickly, and in general it just doesen't give me any feeling of accomplishment. Sure, I have gotten some technologies, and som ship parts, but I have not built a civilization. The techs are far too combat oriented, but combat in the game is just an exercise in who rolls most 6's on the dice.

This game strikes an amazing balance between military and economic contests. However, it is not inevitable that the game will be played that way. It is possible to focus on building your resources without initiating combat (that is, it's possible to turtle). But you can't initiate combat without building your resources. With a bit of luck, you can do well by focusing only on building resources. But it seems that striking the right balance between resourcing and combat makes for a more fun game, and the people who do that well seem to do better in the game. That point of balance is a moving target given how dynamic the gameplay is. The result is a really fun game that keeps you thinking. What helps all of this work especially well is that the game design is stunningly smooth in its execution. There is an amazing amount of gameplay that is squeezed out of such little amount of adminstrative overhead and fiddliness.

Scored as 9 after one play. Disappointed that it's not a 10 as I thought this would be "the" game. My feelings are probably due to playing the most excellent A Game of Thrones a few days previously too - perhaps I'm being spoilt.
I think a lot also has a lot to do with who you are playing with too, but I'm still not convinced on the combat.

I look forward to playing again and hope that the rating will then increase.

A space theme euro game with combat: A good combination for me. I never could get into TI3 due to the shear length of this acclaimed epic game. So this 1 is a very good alternative.

Good game. A mashup of euro and american mechanics. Interesting resource management and area control. 
There are some elements that are a bit too random for me though, namely the drawing of VP chits and technology chits from bags. These draws can be very random and can cause some serious VP and/or devolopment swings between players, and there's really nothing you can do about it.
I've seen people win because they were lucky and drew a couple of high VP-chits during early combat.
I've seen people loose because their economy were stuck because the needed techs that never showed up (or showed up but were grabbed by another player).
This can make the game frustrating, which is not fun in an 3-4 hour game. Some sort of variant with a commonly available developments would be nice.

This is a pretty good space civ game but I don't like how much direct conflict there is.  It is possible to not fight any other players but I think it is harder to win that way.  Once the tiles run out you pretty much have to fight your neighbors in order to progress and have a chance at winning.

Eclipse is- or was- something of a perfect storm game, smashing up a delectable mix of Euro-Wargame-4X-+-Civ into an attractive package with plastic minis and random hex board.  The game is not exactly any one of these styles- 4X most of any, I guess- but it has flavors of all of them.

It's not an incredible mess- in fact it's a great game.

I took a long time getting to play this in part because I couldn't believe that, but it is a sharp game that flows together well, makes sense as you start to play, enables different paths to victory, and has good (not stellar) graphics.

Players settle areas with three kinds of colonists providing three basic resources- but the kind is determined by the board, not the cube.  Players use discs as they take actions each round, and each action costs progressively more. Players also influence regions with discs, so maintaining influence requires money- the more discs are on the board, the higher the cost each turn. The more settlers are on the board, the more resource is revealed for collection turn-by-turn; it's really a pretty brilliant way of managing something that could have been overwhelmingly complicated if it was done by AH in the 80's.

Combat is handled when ships are in the same region- there are rounds based on weapon types, with some being far more effective than others, but the types available also vary.

Technology choices are randomly determined at start of game, and come out in dribs and drabs. Do I grab the key tech choice first, or influence the system between us. I need to build ships if I do that, but can I afford the actions?

Lots of delicious choices as you grow a Terran or alien civ to command a corner of space, and battle for supremacy in the galaxy's rim.

I am starting this in elevated company at an 8, after a 1st solo 3-player game. I can understand why it not just fans of the new and shiny who would love this- it is a tasty game, and I look forward to more plays soon.

Played with 5 others, 4 were new.  The game took 3 hours, but I have discounted that. 

There is a lot of complexity with the game, but a hugh ammount of luck.  (Our game had only 2 power plants drawn for research.)  Also, one seasoned player got the lowest score, as his starting system was repeatedly surrounded by aliens.  He was held back the whole game.  

I can see an attraction to the game, but in the end I do not think the luch factor is balanced with the complexity.  I am also cursed with dice rolling skills.  I tend to poorly rate games that are dependent on rolling a bunch of 6's together.

The good:

I like the simplicity of the economic system of this space-themed 4X game.

The not-so-good:

Hate the fact that the military buildup/combat system is complicated and yet comes down to very swingy die rolls/tile draws at the end - I'm fine with complicated systems, but there has to be payoff to the complication, and I don't feel that it is worth it in this case. Another way to put it is that the depth-to-complexity ratio is very low.

Dislike the theme of the game - sci-fi is actually a negative for me. While I'm perfectly happy to play games with themes I'm not interested in/dislike provided that I like the gameplay enough, I just don't enjoy the gameplay that much here. I think that many people enjoy the game because of the theme (4X in space) - the mechanics themselves do not make the game in this case. But since the theme doesn't work for me, the game doesn't either.

Also takes too long for 4+ players.

This game is fantastic, however I could never justify buying it. 4 hrs approx play time and too heavy to do with my non gaming friends

However as a geeky treat once in a while on a saturday at games club this would be great

Just posted this on facebook in a boardgames discussion. It feels relevant to copy/paste.

"I just played Eclipse down at the games club I play at in London so I thought it was topical that I mention it. This should give you an idea on timeframes for the game.

It is possible to play with 4 experienced players in 3 hours and therefore possible to get a game into an evening. However this time we were playing with 1 newbie... 45 minutes into the evening we were done with the rules explanations... 30 minutes into the game someone had to take an emergency call from work (that obviously can't be helped)... 20 minutes after that we were back to playing.

We only completed 7 of the 9 turns and one of the other guys was keen to tot up VPs. We established he had 25 to my 23, the other 2 were miles behind. And so he declared himself the winner and said that it was the only thing that could be done as we had to pack away.

I was most irritated as I was building up to a big attack, I had 3 Plasma Missiles with +3 computers on each of my cruisers, I had 2 Plasma Cannons and a Plasma Missile on my Starbases, also with +3 to hit (which were placed strategically). Now I should put this in context I had 4 Cruisers 1 hex away from the central alien and worked out I could pick up 10 points in the next round with still 1 more alien to fight after that.

I was allied with all three other players but the only way for them to beat me was to attack (break the alliance and inherit the traitor card) then still lose to me and thats good for me still. I was in an unbeatable position and challenged the 'winner' to suggest where his final points could possibly come from. He couldn't but stuck to 'the game ended after 7 turns because it had to, therefore I won'.

Overall I found it thoroughly unsatisfying... Not because of the game. The game is fantastic. But be prepared to set aside a whole day for your first 3/4 games of it or be very irritated as the game reaches it's climax."

---

Edit: I still LOVE this game. I've loved it more with the more times that I've played it. Unfortunately I rarely get it finished because of how long it takes. The 30 min per player on the box is bullshit. In reality it's 45 mins per player that knows what they're doing + 1 hour per player that doesn't + 2 hours per idiot. Then add to this 30 mins set up, 15 mins packing away and 30 mins teaching (if there's newbies).

With 6 players expect to set aside a full day, unless you have the most awesome friends in the world (in which case it's still an afternoon).

(05/2012) Comment based on one play.

5-player game of newbies took 5.5-6 hours.

This is a brilliant design, in terms of innovative Euro and Ameritrash mechanisms, integrating meaningfully and seamlessly within a sci-fi theme/context.

I have always wondered if a [thing=1431]War at Sea[/thing]/[thing=1442]Victory in the Pacific[/thing] combat system could be applied to a [thing=12493]TI3[/thing] context, and it seems here is the answer.

While I am a fan of TI3, I have always been disappointed with the combat system. Ship types are generic and functionally (and visually) the same from race to race, with some minor differentiation based on technology upgrades and racial ability. Combat is a la [thing=98]Axis & Allies[/thing], where each unit has a different "to hit" number. For example, a lowly fighter needs a 9 on D10, a cruiser needs a 7, while a dreadnaught needs a 5. All ships, with the exception of dreadnaughts and war suns are destroyed with one hit. Combat is simultaneous, with ships on both sides firing everything. The total number of hits is tallied up for the attacker and defender. However, the most ridiculous and unrealistic aspect of the A&A-type combat system is that the each side gets to [i]allocate[/i] damage to their own ships, irrespective of the type of ship that attacked--there is no way to target a specific ship. The most common strategy is to produce carriers with lots of inexpensive fighters, which then serve as cannon fodder to absorb the hits and screen the more expensive units.

The War at Sea combat system was able to abstractly represent many different classes of ships from WWII using three numbers (each from 1 to 9). A lowly heavy cruiser was typically a '1 1 7', meaning it had a 1D6 attack, could take one point of damage before sinking, and had a relative speed of 7. If attacking, a '6' on 1D6 was a hit, with each hit re-rolled with another 1D6 to determine how many points of damage was inflicted on the targeted ship. The Bismark was represented as a '4+ 9 6'. The '4+' meant 4D6, but it needed a '5' or a '6' to hit. With 9x "hit points", it could take a lot of damage, but could not outrun a heavy cruiser (if it wished to disengage/retreat), due to its slower speed factor ('6' vs '7').

Eclipse seems to take the War at Sea system, and expands upon it along similar lines from [thing=1589]Star Fleet Battles[/thing], [thing=1540]BattleTech[/thing], and [thing=2891]Starfire[/thing]. It allows players to customize three different classes of ships and a star base class, with unique technologies that improve baseline armor, shielding, firepower, targeting, and speed of each class. The amount of "stuff" that one can pack into a ship class is constrained only by the number of hull spaces and power source (an idea SFB, BT, and Starfire share), the latter which can be upgraded with technology. For example, a cruiser template has six hull boxes, five already filled with subsystems: 1x armor/hit point; 1x "weapon" that allows 1D6 for attack, doing 1x point of damage, but consumes 1x point of energy; a "computer" that gives +1 to hit; a "drive" that allows the ship 1x hex movement, but consumes 1x point of energy; and a "energy source" that provides up to 3x points of energy, enough to power the weapon and drive, and possibly one other subsystem that consumes no more than 1x point of energy. In WaS terms, this is sort of like a '1+ 1 1'.

Ship class is further differentiated by an "initiative" rating. The cruiser described above as a '2' rating, meaning it will fire before a baseline dreadnaught, which is sluggish as represented by a '1' rating. The least expensive class, the interceptor (i.e., '1 0 1') has a '3' rating. By adding a fourth number, the initiative number, the interceptor can be described as a '1 0 1 3'. This makes sense as a smaller ship should be more agile and  maneuverable. Increasing the drive capability can improve both movement range (on the board) and initiative (in combat). The interceptor, cruiser, and dreadnaught, can be purchased for 3, 5, and 8 "material" points, respectively. Previous "build your own starship" systems have more granularity in terms of production/acquisition costs, but here, Eclipse keeps it clean and simple. 

As mentioned earlier, these units can be "upgraded" accordingly, with more powerful weapons, armor, shielding, computers, drives, and power source, provided that the specific technology has been researched in a previous action.  There is a "plasma missile" tech that provides "first shot" capability with 2D6 and 2x points of damage, which is similar to air strike factors in WaS and VitP. The most powerful weapon tech in the game is the "antimatter cannon" (reminds me of the "wave motion gun" in Starblazers, or the Romulan "plasma torpedo" in SFB), while only a 1D6 to hit, dishes out 4x points of damage. This allows players to have fun mixing and matching techs and subsystems to create their own "super" starship design.

For example, in my first game, with two randomly found ancient artifacts, I was able to upgrade the cruiser '1+ 1 1 2' template into a '1+3* 5 2 3' "super cruisers" (the '1+3*' means 1D6+3, so the weapon hits on a 3/4/5/6, with 2x points damage). Compared to a baseline dreadnaught ('2+1 2 1 1), these units were feared by the other players. Researching and customizing ships individually is probably the most fascinating and fun part of the game. As a side benefit, this now serves as the foundation for truly asymmetric alien starship designs, an available and desirable option, once players have mastered playing the terran race "baseline" ships. 

Eclipse manages to expand upon the concept of action points. As the player explores/colonizes/conquers other systems, they can progressively increase their incomes (in a non-linear increasing fashion) of three resource types: money, technology, and material, which are represented by three sliding continuums on their player tableau. A player may take as many actions per game turn, but each additional action taken (and expansion into other systems) has a progressively more expensive upkeep cost (non-linear), which must be paid in money. Thus, the amount of money they generate, as well as the money/tech/material (tech and material can be exchanged into money at a 2:1 rate) banked from previous turns, effectively constrains the number of actions they can take. Eclipse also allows a player to take six different types of actions: explore, influence, research, upgrade, build, and move, all which have mechanical equivalents in most 4X games.

Turn order is standard clockwise order, similar to classic [thing=181]Risk[/thing], [thing=15363]Nexus Ops[/thing], and [thing=23950]Viktory II[/thing], with each player taking one action or passing. The first player to pass gets the start player marker, and is first to play in the next game turn. Players continue taking actions until they pass. What is unique to Eclipse is that even after passing, they are allowed to "react" to other players' actions with build, upgrade, or move, albeit all three at a significantly diminished capacity. The traditional clockwise order tends to make surprise moves favor the player to the left. For example, if I pass, and the player to my left attacks me with three units, I can still react, but only with one unit. If I attack first with three units, and the player to my left hasn't passed yet, they can respond equally with three units. Clockwise turn order would normally not be an issue, however, in Eclipse, combat is resolved in all contested spaces [i]after[/i] everyone has passed. Thus, both attacking and defending players can continue to move in more and more units into the contested space, only constrained by their banked money/tech/material. This makes surprise attacks based on numerical superiority almost meaningless within the context of traditional turn-based games.

Although this is a minor quibble, I would have preferred a variable turn order, as in TI3, which is dictated by selection of a strategy card/role, [thing=28720]Brass[/thing], which is based on how much money was spent, or [thing=1491]Outpost[/thing], which is based on current VP status. Bidding for turn order, using resources like in the advanced rules for [thing=54]Tikal[/thing], would make it more interesting also. On the other hand, determining the variable turn order for the next game turn can potentially add some time and slow down game play.

The explore and influence actions are a means of expanding one's empire, to get more of the three types of resources. Research allows acquisition of one tech for X number of technology/research points. Upgrade allows customization of up to two subsystem hull boxes on the four unit types. Build is producing said units in controlled systems. Move allows up to three movement points, which can be applied to a single ship or divvied up among two or three.

The exploration aspect is one of Eclipse's strongest points, and it's weakest. With every explore action, a player may pick a random tile and place it on the board, orienting it in such a fashion to ensure legal entry via "wormhole" and to either inhibit or enable contact with other players' system hexes. This is similar to the various tile-laying mechanisms, such as [thing=822]Carcassonnne[/thing], [thing=1334]Entdecker[/thing], and most closely, [thing=54]Tikal[/thing]. Each system hex comes with an assortment of "goodies", such as VP for controlling the hex, planets (on which to place population, and thus improving your resource tracks), and ancient artifacts (which grant either VP or a one-time tech upgrade or resource boost). While this can be fun and fascinating to seek out and collect those, it is possible for bad draws, where a player is surrounded by aliens (with nasty ships), effectively blocking them in for several turns, which is what happened to one player in my first game. Since there are a finite number of outer rim system hexes, they tend to go quickly on a first-come, first-served basis. By the third turn, all of the system hexes were gone, essentially locking in the "known universe" for that game. The exploration action became useless, and the player that was blocked-in initially, had no outer rim systems to explore although he had the wormhole access and space. A similar situation can occur in TI3, depending on system tile draw there, and then the subsequent placement of those systems. It may be a simple fix to "reserve" a specific number of outer rim system hexes per player, although this may require more system tiles through a possible expansion.

There are several minor annoyances about Eclipse's movement, however. For one, each move action means that at most three ships will be able to move together, so even if one was to amass a huge fleet in one hex, it would take several actions to move them elsewhere. Of course, on the other hand, interestingly, a lone ship with "tachyon drive" (3x hex movement) could conceivably move [i]nine[/i] hexes on the board and attack an opponent's outpost at the outer edge of their empire. Another annoyance is the concept of "pinning" in Eclipse. It is possible for one/two/three ships to enter an opponent's hex populated with a ship or two, "pin" those ships on a one-to-one basis, and continue moving with the remaining ships (provided they have  the drive technology and upgrade to do so). This means that all fronts are potentially "porous"; if frontier systems can be bypassed by pinning, interior homeworlds are not necessarily safe. This is in contrast to TI3, where a single destroyer can "block" an entire fleet of dreadnaughts and warsuns (unless they have the lightwave deflector tech). Whether either scenario is realistic or not can be debatable, but given the enormity of each system hex (in either game), Eclipse's approach seems to make sense.

Combat is also slightly less satisfying, as it is held in all contested hexes [i]after[/i] all players have passed, and not "as-you-go" compared to TI3 or other turn-order based space games. Since movement seems to be more clumsy in Eclipse, "grand" conquest strategies may need to be planned over a course of several turns. Interestingly enough, combat is resolved in the outer rim systems first (based on a "system number" order), and spiraling in towards the climactic galactic center. Producing units is relatively expensive, in terms of actions and resources, so fleets tend to be small. Thus, there is no need for an fleet upkeep mechanic, or fleet size constraint as imposed within TI3. Because of this, the epic space battles I have seen in TI3, may be limited to small task force engagements in Eclipse.

The research aspect of Eclipse is done differently, when compared to the tech-tree implementations of TI3 and other space-civ games. A number of tech chits are drawn randomly from a bag, the quantity depending on the number of players. There are no tech prerequisites; if you have the appropriate amount of technology points, you can "buy" that technology chit, much like you can buy buildings in [thing=3076]Puerto Rico[/thing]. Of course, the more powerful technologies are accordingly more expensive. If you don't have the tech points, you can always "trade" your money and material points into tech points on a 2:1 basis (the trading can be done for the other two resource types as well). There are three technology types, designated in three distinct rows (or tracks), each emphasizing specific aspects. As one develops more technologies along a certain row, there are discounts that get progressively higher, although each tech has a minimum purchase value regardless of discount. As tech is developed along each track, the rightmost tech spaces also give VP at the end of the game. Unfortunately, there are only limited quantities of the more powerful technologies, so not everybody will be able to get them, which is similar to the limited quantities of buildings in PR, although in PR every building is available at the start. Thus, manipulating the turn order, by passing first, becomes key if one wishes to snatch up a rare tech chit that everybody is eyeing. 

It turns out that the technologies in Eclipse tend to be weighted toward ship design, as in more powerful weapons, armor, shields, etc., as described earlier, and less towards the economics aspect of the game. Once a ship tech chit is purchased, a player can then invoke the upgrade action, and "install" up to two subsystem chits on any of the ship blueprints on their tableau, each filling up a hull box and possibly "covering up" an existing subsystem. This gives players great flexibility as well as agonizing decisions, since they must either focus on upgrading one ship class, or spread the upgrades among several classes. The only minor quibble about Eclipse's implementation is that upgrades are instantaneous, regardless of location. Thus, that lone cruiser out in the middle of nowhere can suddenly be juiced up with more powerful weapons and energy source, for example. [thing=84419]Space Empires: 4x[/thing], by contrast, has separate counters to specifically keep track of fleets with older technologies. While this would have been more realistic, Eclipse's design choice again keeps it clean and simple.

The game lasts nine turns, where at the end the player with the most VP is the winner. This is different from TI3, which is a race to 9 or 10 VP. VP in Eclipse is awarded for controlled systems, alliances, collected artifacts (taken for VP and not the technology), monoliths (sort of like 'statues' in Puerto Rico, pure material points --> VP), and "reputation", which is hidden. Reputation is sort of a random assortment of VP chits that players secretly collect, based purely on their military exploits; a player gets to "search" through X number of VP chits in a bag, based on simply being in combat and the number and type of units they destroyed. This last aspect can significantly swing the game in terms of VP, so classic turtling and focusing on research will not win the game. There must be a moderate amount of (and preferable early) aggression to collect the best VP chits, since players are only allowed to keep a very limited amount of them on their tableau.

There is so much to like here in this design. In terms of game mechanisms, it is very simple and straightforward, with most of it being intuitive. It is possible to quickly learn the game (preferably, from an experienced player), with little downtime compared to some other conquest games, space opera or other. Because of its streamlined play, I see it serving as a rock-solid foundation for various additional house rules and extensive customization, and it already screams for an expansion or two, in order to more fully flesh out the Eclipse universe.

My initial play was very favorable, although I am concerned about balance issues due to the random nature of how the system tiles come out during exploration. In our game, the player to my left unfortunately was blocked-in during early expansion, by running into relatively powerful ancient units (that had to be destroyed, before he could expand any further). By the time he was able to "break out", by focusing on research and building more powerful units, the rest of the exploration tiles had been used by the other players. The technologies that are available for purchase also come out in a random fashion at the end of each game turn, so early turn order can favor certain players over others in gaining rare, but powerful technology. Also, each player ended up with wildly different resource allocations, thus making the mid-game somewhat unbalanced. Still, although there is some randomness, it feels appropriate for what one should expect from space exploration.

Another concern is that with repeated plays, the game may begin to feel "same-y", since there is very little flavor and variation to the overall back-story of the theme. This may be due to our initial game where we all played humans. With asymmetric aspects introduced by alien races, this may continue to be interesting. Although the flexibility offered by the ability to customize ships is absolutely wonderful, and a game in of itself, I am concerned that so much effort (and actions) went into customizing a ship type that only saw combat once or twice during the entire game. Granted, this had a side benefit of giving me VP. Thus, the "design your own ship" mechanism seems to be out of place, being more detailed and complicated than it needs to be in the space opera scale Eclipse is trying to emulate. (On second thought, I probably should have been attacking with these awesome ships!)

The components look very good, with good production values. There is a palpable Finnish minimalism that I must respect from a design choice perspective, as it is definitely muted compared to FFG's typical chrome and busy detail. The rules seem adequate, although there were some obscure circumstances that took some digging to clarify. As for theme, it feels somewhat sterile compared to TI3, however, where everything seems to be generic. For that reason alone, it is definitively NOT the TI3-killer that I was expecting. There is no "politics" aspect, save for the alliance mechanism (which is a brilliant way to do trade agreements). There are no "take that" cards, as represented by the Action Cards in TI3, so there are no unexpected surprises or intrigue. With the exception of exploration and available research tech, the game state is comparatively stable and quantifiable. Overall, the game shines in the smooth playability and intuitiveness of the game mechanisms. It is sufficiently different and novel given its "build your ship" mechanism, and significantly streamlined from TI3, for me to consider it a slot in my game library.

I am excited about this game, and eagerly look forward to many more plays. My initial rating is a solid '8', with plenty of room to move up.

Hey! How did a comment turn into a review? I must [i]really[/i] like this game. :P

Sorry about the length. :blush::whistle:


Update (06/23/12): Second play with own copy, with 5-players (2x newbies and 3x "played it once"), took 5 to 5.5 hours. Setup took 30 minutes. Rules explanation took 45-60 minutes. Takedown took 15-20 minutes. Everyone had a good time, although the initial 2-3 turns were clocking in at an hour each, making for a long slog. Final turn saw many scattered battles all over, with 29/29/27/17/15 points respectively with total resources being tiebreaker.

Played with several house rules:
1) Variable Turn Order [filepage=74846]variant[/filepage] using this [url=http://iresto.free.fr/bzh/eclipse/eclipse.png]image[/url] (using the cards only--if reaction actions were added to the "next turn" cards, this would be fantastic; no pawns necessary!)
2) Warp Sector [thread=755962]variant[/thread] for 5-players.
3) Designation of targets on a ship-to-ship basis (no splitting of firepower) [i]before[/i] rolling dice. 

All three house rules were readily welcomed and all agreed these were much better alternatives.

This session was more intense, with more combat involving more research and upgrades of ship subsystems. It alleviates my concern about so much effort going into ship design, since it was immediately apparent that better ships win more battles, and thus strongly determine who will be doing better in the game. The other concern that was alleviated was the "those who explore more are going to win" fallacy. I think I did the most exploration, but ended up with so-so system hexes. Several players were hemmed in early due to poor exploration draws, so they pursued research aggressively for the same explore actions, and ended up doing far better than my exploration strategy.

Although there are many random elements in the game (i.e., discovery tiles, system hex draws, reputation tiles, combat dice, research chits), it isn't totally chaotic like Cosmic Encounter; there is enough control (or the illusion of control) to manage the destiny of one's empire.

The population cubes/action discs uncovering the income/deficit value seems to be borrowed from [thing=43015]Hansa Teutonica[/thing]. This makes for an initially cluttered player tableau, but in terms of gameplay, it is simply fantastic. Upkeep is quick and intuitive. It is game mechanisms like this one, and the seamless integration of many other mechanisms, that makes this game smooth as glass.

I'm going to up this to a '9'. It is not TI3 by any stretch of the imagination, but Eclipse is clearly its own breed of game and there are no pretensions to being a replacement of TI3. Comparisons are inevitable with other space games, but this game stands on its own, based on its unique take of the "4X" genre. After pondering this awhile, TI3 is a [i]space opera[/i], while Eclipse is a [i]space war/economic game[/i]. TI3 has [i]drama[/i], while Eclipse has [i]action[/i]. TI3 is [i]subtle[/i] (remember, it is [i]not[/i] to be played like a war game), while Eclipse is [i]in your face[/i]. The game's minimalism in terms of mechanisms and well-integrated systems serves as a rock-solid foundation on which players can customize and tune Eclipse to their own liking, with house rules and variants, as well as for official expansions. This is exemplified by the sheer number of pages of posts in the various Eclipse forums. I don't think it is too hard a prediction to see that Eclipse will be considered an important watershed design in the realm of 4X, an instant "classic" when we look back at this in a number of years.

Update (08/18/12) 14 plays: Managed a 6P game in 2.5 hrs (25 min/player)! 5P in 3.1 hrs (37 min/player) and 3.7 hrs (44 min/player). 4P in 3.6 hrs from opening box to closing box (53 min/player). We've nixed the "designate target" rule, and have gone back to the original rules--it still bothers me that damage is allocated [i]after[/i] the dice are rolled, but it is much faster.

I am starting to wonder if Eclipse's narrative is the same every game: 1) There is almost [i]always[/i] a climactic battle in the center during the last turn; 2) A decent expansion for an empire seems tied to getting that critical "Advanced Robotics" or "Orbital" tech in the first round or two, which is dependent on the random first turn order, and dependent on if there are randomly one or more copies of these techs; and 3) The kind of systems that are drawn will relatively determine the money/research/material tracks for each of the races, and how well they will do in a given game. In contrast, TI3 may have varied narratives every time, due to the richness of the theme and game mechanics. It still is impossible to decide which is the better design, as they each invoke gaming nirvana in different ways.

Update (12/24/12) 16 plays: Two plays with newcomers (3-player and 4-player), after a four-month hiatus, provided yet another slice of the Eclipse experience. The "flavor" of a particular game can change depending on the selection of Ring I, II, and III hexes. The inner rings are loaded with better planets, but little or no discovery tiles, while the Ring III hexes are the opposite. Players that go outward will encounter more discovery tiles, and hence powerful Ancient techs that can conceivably steer the game in that player's favor. However, those systems tend to be relatively poor, thus offering little long-term economic advantages. The inner systems, by contrast, offer better economics, boosting the money, tech, or material tracks; the tradeoff is no techs for combat. Another interesting tradeoff arises in the number and distribution of hexes occupied with ancients. Although being surrounded by ancients may pose a near-term obstacle(s), it incentivizes actions toward building an offensive capability, which ultimately results in more reputation points. If one is posed with "easy" systems, the income tracks grow accordingly, but focus may be lost on building for war. If one does not encounter any ancients, there are no opportunities to gain better reputation points (the assumption being that drawing later in the game results in poorer draws), other than being forced to attack others after exploration has been exhausted. Attacking is rewarded, yet drawing another player's ire may put both at a disadvantage, while other non-combatants pull ahead in other areas. Fighting early and drawing early can result in a good 12-14 points hidden until the end of the game, contrasted with 12-15 points for 4-5 monoliths for a non-combatant.

This is a game about building space ships, and it's a lot less interesting than it is supposed to be. It's not as fun as Galaxy Trucker (as a ship-builder) and it's not really a conquest epic (give me TI:3, Galactic Emperor, or even Ad Astra anyday). I don't know. The group seems to like it. I wouldn't turn down a chance to play, but I'm certainly not getting the excitement it seems to generate on the Geek.

I knew it would be a long shot to get this game played. In fact, I've set it up once with the intention to play it only for one player to drop out and everyone else to follow suit. I just had to own this game after reading so much about its unique user interface. The UI is just moderately impressive, but the game is still great, if a little swingy due to the minor random elements.

A really good game and a fun complete experience if no one is eliminated during the game.
Has some fidgety scoring mechanics, but the overall game, of expanding an empire, increasing the research and building strong ships to battle out with others makes it a great game.
Because of the scoring mechanics, its long duration and especially the board setup time and resource tracking, it doesn't get a better rating.

This is a fun game, but it's definitely something you have to set aside a whole night for.

The best part of this game is there are so many viable strategies to play. It seems like you more or less go with the strategy that matches your early game luck though (for better or worse). 

The tiles and components in this game are quite visually appealing, although I wish they had chosen more subtle colors for the actual plastic ship miniatures. Against a background of muted violets and blues, the bright yellow cruisers look jarring. I suppose you could paint them but that'd be awful.

There are some excellent ideas here for a meaty 4X empire-building in space. Yet there are some odd and swingy mechanics that really blemish the experience.

Early exploration is hampered by random tile drawing effects. Drawing tiles with hostile alien ships, mis-matched jump-gates or fruitless planets is painful. Random tiles may sound like a good idea but the implementation here is too big a swing. Combat is a strictly 1-vs-1 since the rules oddly do not allow allies. Even weirder is that victory points are awarded to all combatants via random draw. Very swingy.

For such a long game with few victory points, these odd design choices simply allow too much overwhelming luck. Combat is unfulfilling and exploring can feel down-right unfair at times. Bearable if the game was 1+ hours but hideous for a 4+ hours experience. Though not nearly as hideous as the plastic ships ...

The way the player boards work is well designed.  The fighting game for territory was pretty standard.  Overall I can see why people like it.

But I've got better things to play with more complex decisions & that are more rewarding for the time investment.

For me, Galactic Emperor has a better ratio of enjoyment to effort but overall there aren't many space games that I like & I think it's partly the theme too.

A game we seem to have played many time before: Twilight Imperium, Galactic Emperor and probably many others. The formula is pretty familiar, explore, develop new techs and fight wars. What lifts this space epic above the ordinary is really two things: the presence of neutral enemies who can be fought and defeated for plunder, and limited connections between hexes and sharply limited ship range to cut down on arbitrary attacks. This doesn't mean, however that there isn't a huge random factor in which tile you get when you explore and what prizes you get when you fight. An early money boost, in particular is a massive swing in your favour. The alien races tighten the game up quite a lot, there's less money and so fewer actions available which speeds the game considerably, but it's still an incremental snowball and there's no way back once you fall behind. For all of the detail in the technologies and ship upgrades, combat still feels remarkably bland. You're just rolling for hits irrespective of how powerful your ships are and a decisive advantage is difficult to obtain. Several gaming buddies now own this, so I'm sure to be playing regularly, but it's just a little short of being a compelling game for me.

Rating is more subject to change than usual.  This is a really clever game; I enjoy how it manages to link the economic aspects to the combat part of the game.  The tech tree is neat too. Since I've only played once, I feel like I'm really just scratching the surface on this, though, and I can't really assess the different strategies, the depth of the game, etc. I do know it was definitely longer than I wanted it to be; I'd hoped to play in about three hours but I guess that is unrealistic. Anyway, I'd be happy to play again. (1 play)

Eclipse was something I was really excited about, before getting, and I have to say I was slightly disappointed. It's a great game, really really good, but not the 4x masterpiece I was hoping. It has the brilliant ship-design system, interesting species differentiation, and generally good mechanics, but it does occasionally feel too dominated by swings of luck, particularly when it comes to turning over hexes; no-ancient discovery tiles can be so strong in the early game, and failing to get a useful tile in S2 is a real kick in the otherwise neat action economy.

First time playing a 5-player game with almost all new players, and my first foray into the 4x genre (so grain of salt and all that) but this game seemed too long for what it had to offer.  The high cost and limitations of taking actions made the game both too long and too short, as it took a long time to get things going and then the game ended before anything really interesting could happen.  Other comments about your tile draws dictating your strategy seem on the mark - get a lot of one particular resource and you're basically funneled down that path, get bad tile draws and you're pretty much screwed.  I ended up with a lot of brown planets (and 0 or less surplus money for the entire game) so I built a lot of ships because I didn't have much else to do.  Another player was dealt a crippling blow around turn 3 and spent the next 2+ hours unable to do anything, which was fun for neither him nor me (I don't like seeing people put in that position, even if it increases my chances of winning).  Our game did end with a ridiculously large battle for the center tile which was entertaining for the 5 minutes it took to sort it out, but I can't say it was worth the 3 1/2 hours it took to get there.

RATING: 8.5
Though with a degree of luck in combat in exploration, Eclipse manages to temper the entropy with various technology, economy, and alliance elements in this game of space dominance. Shorter and simpler than Twilight Imperium while retaining a high level of interaction and numerous paths to victory, Eclipse remains a positive choice in my game group. It plays well with 3 through 6 players, though I can't speak for beyond that number (with expansion) as I've yet to play with that many.

Pros
- Nice looking game on the table.  Very shiny
- Intuitive rules
- Simple yet effective resource mechanics
- Highly customizable

Cons
- Not a lot of epic feel due to a limit on the number of turns and simple space tiles.  (This is a fast victory point collection game)
- "Moving parts" can be knocked off their places easily with a table bump.  Get a big sturdy table.

The influence disk/upkeep mechanic is very interesting. The game may take long on paper, but doesn't feel slow at all. There are always interesting and meaningful decisions to be made. The random nature of the galaxy hex distribution introduces a certain amount of luck, and has on occasion led to imbalanced starting conditions. While I see the benefits of this streamlined design (playability, time), I can't help but feel like something is missing (e.g. a valid alternative route to victory like research or economy).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I like Eclipse quite a bit, but there are a lot of random factors in play and players can find themselves out of the running with a long game ahead of them. I am definitely willing to play, but would put other games ahead of it. The random factors also make this game a poor 2p experience imo.

I appreciate the tight design and smooth mechanics of Eclipse, and it does achieve the lofty goal of laying out a space conquest game playable in a few hours. But, somehow the Eclipse universe feels small and homogeneous--I wish there was more to explore, more distinct qualities between the aliens and planets. However, those are criticisms of theme, not the game itself.

I dislike the plastic ships, the movements, the control table with the wooden cubes (how stylish is to use cheap plastic + plain wood blocks together in one game?).
The population and technology management is OK, but game would be better if those ships were left out... (Unlike the Twilight Imperium, where the ships are great, important and add specific flavour to the battles).
The colors and design is a little bit terrible (cubes only in pink, orange and brown, like a vomit after party...), and the art work is a kind-of second class (OK, not home made, but neither first class) quality...
Did I mention the cheap detail-less plastic ships with high-bright cheap colors? (Yeah, I did.)
I don't know who rates it to 10, but they definitelly haven't played with any really good game yet.
Politics: only when the users are chit-chatting, but the game doesn't really encourage it.

I absolutely love this game.  Its a contender for my favorite game of all time.  Its a perfect mix of Euro and Ameritrash if you will.  There is a lovely balance between empire expansion and taking the battle to your opponents.  I really appreciate the fact this game does a brilliant job making the battles count without making them the sole focus of the game.  Wonderful game.

I loved some of the mechanics introduced in the game - particularly how settlement of certain worlds moved you up your money, science and production tracks.  The bits are fantastic - great gaming bling.

Sadly, the whole is less than the sum of the parts.  The random draw of nearby sectors in your start area as you initially explore the board can either complete make or destroy your game.  And once you fail to expand your faction / grow your economic engine over the first couple of turns to keep pace with your competitors, you will find yourself in a "run-away loser" situation.

The game still looks great and feels like it should be great . . . and I may try it again, but I probably would not be the one to suggest it.

Really enjoying this, and don't expect that to change any time soon... Game am most excited about playing at the moment.

A year later - still getting a lot of enjoyment out of it when it gets played. 9 player game was crazy!

Taking the space 4X and streamlining. There's a lot of smart, elegant mechanisms in Eclipse's design; but in a way it sacrifices flavor for playability. I also am not a fan of how combat is still a dice-fest, although Eclipse keeping its fights in a separate game phase rather than interrupting the main play is probably a wise decision (keeps the game moving).

Played 3 times now and every time I play it I think about the game for days afterwards. What different strategies could be used etc. Also own the Rise of the Ancients expansion as well but so far haven't implemented everything in a single game. Playing as Terrans for the first few games was a great way to learn and then adding in bits of the expansion in later games was a great way to approaching learning. If possible play the game with fewer people first. Our first ever game was with 6 and it took a monumental amount of time. We halved the time for the 2nd play though. There are many many more plays to be had before I get tired of this game.

has a bit more conflict than I like in a game, but otherwise is fantastic.  The only thing that I think is broken is the fact that turn order is random once someone passes. You're screwed if the guy to your left keeps passing, and it's common for the same person to pass a few times in a row. needs a house rule for that, otherwise I can't wait to buy it.

A really impressive design. Love how quick the turns and even the battles go, even though the game itself is a little longer than I normally like. So easy to grasp how everything works, and despite all the techs I didn't feel like I was overwhelmed by a bunch of special abilities and rules exceptions. That's really something in this genre. However, the end scoring can feel pretty anticlimactic. In general this genre just isn't one of my favorites.

Dicefest in space layered on top of economy powered area control of random tiles you explore, luckily you get to decide which kinds of combat dice and modifiers you want to pursue on science track. Though all the economy boosts and some points options are also up for grabs from the same random science market. 

I'm most annoyed by some of the really random rewards you can get, it's aggravating when you've tactically pursued a strategy and suddenly you opponent can just get an exloration reward that upgrades some class of their units into a perfect counter to your fleets.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A long tedious game to setup and early play can be severely one sided. (dice rolls and luck of the random tile draws). However it is a great game with much strategy and tactics required. Since there are only 9 turns until the end of the game, you really need to know how to manage your colonies and know when to research/expand/attack/etc.. Good for experienced players and somewhat easy to learn (albeit a steep learning curve).

OK, this is going to officially be old and crotchety.  But I am beginning to think my friends in the Euro community are going increasingly gaga over games like eclipse because they turned up their nose at "Ameritrash" for so long and didnt realize what the genre had to offer.  I liked Eclipse, but this is a very conventional 4x game (explore, expand, exploit, exterminate).  It has some nice Euro style refinements -- I particularly like the "post pass" options.  But taken as a whole, the game does not really tackle any of the hardwired problems of the genre.  For instance, there is downtime -- plenty of it, and more players just adds more.  There are no real catch-the-leader mechanisms, and the tech tree discounts tend to reinforce the problem.  The rich will get richer.  There is no reason that turn 9 will not become a silly Götterdämmerung, cuz those thips you've been buying are worthless at the end of the game.  These are problems that people who have been playing wargames since the 70s have understood for years.  I think to be a game getting this much hype, there should have been a concerted effort to get at some of them.

RATING: 7
With three or four players, Eclipse is an engaging, competitive, and well-streamlined Space 4X experience.

With more than four players, it drags. The playtime seems to shoot up non-linearly. Also, with fewer tiles-per-player, and less room between players, the luck factor seems increased. One game I observed had a particularly unlucky player crippled on the second turn, with no recourse for the next 4 hours.

Some games I've played have felt _too_ streamlined, with little story arc other than build-up-and-smash-at-the-end.

Finally, I like the Plasma Rockets just the way they are. Leave them alone!

RATING: 5
Eclipse is a fantastic 4x space game with a focus on resource management.  There is combat but you're focused on deterrence over outright incursions as each player tries to outmatch the other while parking their ships at the edge of their borders.  There aren't massive fleets here like in Twilight Imperium, but when combat does break out it can get bloody and intense.  Eclipse has plenty of options and depth to satisfy multiple playthroughs for anyone looking for a little more "Euro" in their trashy space empire games.

5/4/16: Being limited by money puts you at the luck of the draw. You may be surrounded by money generating tiles or end up in an impenetrable field of hostile NPCs. Eclipse is fun until you hit that wall then it's 2 hours of non-competition.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Yeah, its good, not without fault though. 

I'll put up more comments later, think TI3 (but WAY more streamlined) with a Tech track a little similar to FFG's Civ, and a playtime close to Civ. Eclipse is actually easy to teach, learn and most importantly PLAY.

EDIT - Well its been awhile since I wrote the above but I'll try to comment on what I remember about the game best I can. 

Seems to be pretty well designed and developed overall, calling it “Civ in Space” isn't too far from the mark, at least it reminded me a little FFG’s newest version, and of course TI3 (still have not played TTA!).  There is lots to like here, really liked the fast turns to keep things moving, I played with 6 and while it was a LONG game your turn still comes around fairly quickly each time.  Sometimes it seemed your options were really limited, for example from the Techs available you could only afford one or two due to your money or the draw, and I found some other examples like this where some turns felt scripted or limited especially near the beginning of the game.  

I think the game might be best with 4 or 5, with 6 there is no way you are going to interact with everyone anyway so you lose nothing and likely gain with lower playtime and less time in between turns (I wont even call it downtime because the turns were that fast). What did seem to take too long sometimes was combat, figuring out all the modifiers and then rolling, and rolling until things got resolved.  Overall it was okay, you have ways to modify your rolls with Tech, though these can be countered by your opponents with their tech.  

Speaking of luck, the dice rolling obviously which you hope would even out and in the VP chit pull, which I found a little concerning as well as exploration which many have commented on. For VP's I wonder if the chits should have been 1 – 3 instead of 1 – 4 but 1-4 could be fine, though maybe a chit pull for VP’s wasn’t the best route to go.  There are many other ways to get VP’s AND usually you are going to pull 2 – 5 chits out of the bag and keep only 1, also, you only get to accumulate 5 or 6 this way so again, likely things will even out and the more you attack and go to the bag, the better, that is a key point right there.  Overall I think the luck is probably okay but maybe a little on the high side for the length of the game, though if you suck at rolling you might not feel this way and if you get burned in more ways than one it could be a [i]really[/i] long game for you.  

I did find one little issue near the end of the game where if you did not have your VP track full you could send a ship or two on a suicide mission just for a quick chit pull or two, this felt wrong/off, but getting a VP chit for losing and not killing anything is a nice little compensation.  Rules are nicely streamlined, its really fairly easy to teach and learn overall. The thing they really did right here over TI3 was to encourage fighting by giving VP’s (although see my suicide note), that was one thing I commented on after playing TI3.  Has somewhat slow beginning like TI3, here your choices are fairly limited in the beginning just like there, but it is much faster than TI3's in comparison.  Going last should have probably been compensated, you miss out on some cheap techs at start of game (all anyone can afford) and you can be potentially boxed in slightly by the other players so maybe another small niggle here.

I can appreciate that people like this game, but it's definitely not for me. Based on comments here and otherwise I was expecting more of an economic eurogame in space, and instead what I got was a conflict heavy 4x game with apparently a slightly more in depth economic system than fans of this genre usually expect. Nothing strictly speaking wrong with it, but I have absolutely no desire to ever play it again.

This game is, in a lot of ways, a near miss. The big problem is that you can get hosed by your tiles and get essentially eliminated early in what is often a pretty long game. Without that problem, this would rate much higher, as I enjoy most everything else about it.

While Eclipse is not my favorite game, the first time I played it I was blown away by the mechanics. This game is  well designed and wonderfully balanced. The game play is unique enough that of the possibly 7 times I've played, I have had a different experience every time. Unlike other deep strategy games, this game really differentiates itself in win strategies.

The ship design mechanic is the best part. Even if you are behind in technologies, you can design ships to outsmart your opponents.

Definitely one of the best designed games I have ever played.

I think that this is a cool concept for a game. Who doesn't love a changing board and the choice to directly or indirectly interact with other players. The artwork is great, the design is smart, and the mechanics are smooth. However, my only problem with it is that luck plays too great a role. My best laid plans can be laid to waste by one lucky roll of the dice. Or, if I explore 4 tiles and they're all garbage then I'm likely screwed. Yes, yes, the statistics will be even throughout multiple plays, but if a game is going to be 2 - 3 hours long then even one bad play can really leave a sour taste. All that being said, if everything goes "normally" then it's a very fun game. Thus, the 7: usually willing to play.

This game is fun..but after playing the 3rd time it seems that the main strategy is "get the biggest ships you possibly can out on the board and destroy everyone."  I don't really have a problem with that.

I understand why everyone loves this. It's a Euro that pretends to be a wargame, while in the end it fails at both. The design does have some slick elements, but unfortunately in doing so has removed all of the flavor from the game. When I play a space-themed 4X game I want to feel like I'm exploring for something other than a pink wooden cube.

This is a very well-designed and balanced game.  Each player builds a space fleet, upgrades the ship types, researches technologies, explores space, fights aliens and opponents, and seeks to obtain the most points.  It's a very engrossing brain burner while at the same time not taking an insane amount of time to play.  Always popular!  I particularly like the way players get to customize the three types of ships by adding components to the outline on their player mat as the game goes on, obtaining improvements through research or through finds from their explorations.

RATING: 10
OK. So I hesitated about my rating for quite a long time but finaly I went for the '10'. For many years I have been searching for a space empire building game that would suit my taste. 

RftG is great but it lacks a board and lacks the space fleet building aspect. 

Galactic Emperor is dull - it just doesn't stand the comparison with other non space theme games. 

Space Empires is good, but the bookkeeping and the involuntarily cheating during games are major flaws. 

And then there is Eclipse - it is fast, it scales well from 2 to 6 players, it is simple to explain, it enables ship building and technological research. It has my favourite board game mechanics: tile placing and in my eyes it has just an enormous re-pliability value. Not to mention that all the mechanics work well together and the game flow is great. No snowball issue either.

Is this my Holy Grail? After two games I am far from saying that but I do see such a possibility. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
I like this a LOT. It's a great Civ game with a sweet theme and a ton of replay-ability. There's some manageable randomness in the die rolls, chit pulls, and available techs. Surprise in exploration, and game design that prevents too much turtling. This should be in everyone's collection ahead of FFG's Sid Meier CIV game as well as MARE NOSTRUM. Better than those by far. 

It's not a space opera. It does not replace TI:3. What could, really.

There are too many things that go on in this game for me to really enjoy it.  I never really felt like I was expanding, exploring, exploiting, and especially exterminating.  Exploring is probably the only one that really shines here.  Managing the money, with random techs coming up, and bumping into the table and having all the cubes scatter...  I don't know, it was an alright game, but not very wow. Production was great, the pieces are fine, if not numerous.  The setup and cleanup was quite an ordeal.  It had kind of a "Monopoly in Space" kind of feel with all the banking that went on, and I'm not very down with that.  Not to mention it lasts longer than Monopoly, which just made it more boring.  A great game that lasts forever is perfectly fine.  A dull game that lasts forever is just awful.

It's not the worst game ever, but it could have been so great.  I wanted it to be fantastic - a grand space opera with exciting gameplay!  Hell, they could have taken out all the tech, the tedious exploration, the horrible banking (don't tell me it's not banking, that's all it is), the cubes, the extra bits, add in more combat, sped it up some, and had another Cosmic Encounteresque game, and I would have been fine with that.  But, it does have all the aforementioned items, and we have Eclipse.  Somehow not an epic space opera, but more of a bad soap opera.

I finished a 2-player game feeling kinda dry.  We increased the rounds from 9 to 11 just so that we could do some major battles.

Most fights in this game are minor skirmishes.  It wasn't epic and it was more collecting victory points, which can be fun, but don't think that you can go all out war with anyone.

RATING: 6.2
Was definitely worth a try, some interesting mechanics, but both the length (and yes, I've seen reviews saying it can be played quicker with out 1st timers and repeated plays but the same is true for all games), and the luck (and we're just no talking dice rolls) in a way just makes this a glorified Starfarers of Catan.

Regarding luck, there is the dice rolls for the combat, which can be somewhat mitigated by gaining research and then upgrading, but not only can bad luck at dice rolling hurt and good dice rolling benefit others, but just gaining the research is a luck fest of sorts... not all research is available, it's random each round which research (knowledge/tech) is available, and the luck of the turn order (which you really don't control as passing 1st to go 1st next round doesn't help as you don't know the new research that will be available until next round) decides who can acquire it.  Also luck of the explore action also hurt some players while helping others.

If it wasn't for the length though I'd be up for a 2nd play.

This is a really well designed game. The systems in this game are brilliant. It's more or less the Twilight Imperium experience but in a elegantly streamlined form. And playable in a reasonable amount of time.

That being said, it still felt a bit too long for me, and surprisingly easy to avoid other players. I won strictly because my race got bonus points for having the neutral pirate ships on the board. My winning strategy: explore like wild and avoid other players like the plague. Not horribly exciting.

Initial Rating: 7.0

It took me almost a year to play this, but I finally did :). As the hype is still strong and overwhelming, I wasn´t surprised to find the game a little of a letdown. Eclipse is currently #5 on the BGG rankings.

First of all I have to say I played it with only 3 human players, perhaps my rating will go up when playing with 4 or 6 players.

On the plus side, this is my favorite theme of all time, the rules are intuitive and fairly easy to grasp (in spite of the 30+ pages rulebook which by the way is very well done), for me it has some resemblances to Through the Ages (which is a plus) and the play time is relatively short. The components are pretty clear and nice (Although I´m not crazy about the art) and the game came with a lot of them.

The gameplay is very streamlined and the game has your attention the whole game. I didn’t felt a high down time. I really liked the way eclipse handles the actions and the way you can customize your ships (this is a first for me in a boardgame) :D

I really liked the combat system, it allows you to pit your customized ships against other players or the ancients. Obviously the combat has a lot of luck, but with carefully customization (computers) the luck can be managed.

On the bad side, The art is ok EXCEPT for the depictions of the aliens races, those are abysmally awful. I know this is a very minor thing but as this is my favorite theme I would have loved to see more development of the aliens races…. Their pictures aren´t believable (as believable as an Alien can be :D) and seem put there as an afterthought. I have not yet played with the aliens races, but looking through them only 2 seem to play really different. In general I didn’t feel Eclipse was a thematic game.
 
I’m concerned about the missiles in battle. If someone developed them it becomes an arms race because they can be so powerful in battle. For me this detracts the fun from customizing your ships as there is clearly a (only) superior way to optimizing them (with missiles) :(

In my first game, I didn’t found any tension in my decisions. They felt somewhat scripted as it was always clear what was the best course of action and being first only counted in a handful of situations (although I believe this can change as we get better playing the game). In the middle game, it didn’t matter much if I developed first or built first.


Bottom line, I’m rating Eclipse a 7.0 due to the enjoyment I derived from it on the first play (I won). Eclipse is a good game, perhaps a very good game but I need to play it more to form a better opinion.

For now (beware blasphemy ahead :devil:) I still prefer to play Twilight Imperium. I think there is room for both games in my game collection as I feel they scratch different itches :D.  Twilight Imperium has an epicness feel that Eclipse just don’t have. 

Current Rating 7.0

I’m downgrading Eclipse´s rating due to the fact that I don’t want to play it often, so a 6.0 is better suited according to BGG´s rating system. I want to play it with alien races and with more players to really see if the game gets exiting.

There are alot of nice ideas in the game.  But it feels unpolished.  Games tend to feel scripted and it suffers from a dramatic end of the world problem on the last turn.  I can see an expansion polishing up the flaws but I don't see it being compelling enough to play again anytime soon.

RATING: 8
Eclipse is a work completed at an exceptionally high degree of difficulty.  Many attempts have been made at civilization-light.  Those which have tend to come out as either not civilization (Innovation for example) or not light - which for a civ game means 2-3 hours.

Eclipse undoubtedly has a civilization feel.  There is exploration, economy building, and combat.  It also deals with some of the "problems" of the genre in novel ways.  Actions per turn, for example, are a simple function of one's economy level and the amount of systems one currently controls - and one always has the opportunity to blow past one's current economy level to deal with a pressing threat.  Of course the instability may cause the player to have to relinquish control over some outlying systems - which may have been the attacker's goal all along.

Movement is also rather innovative, with the wormhole mechanic restricting movement.  This leads to the somewhat visually off-putting result that sometimes you are not as close to your opponents as the board indicates due to the nonexistence of wormholes.  Going off and exploring solitaire has some drawbacks though - there is a small but perceptible advantage to establishing diplomatic relations with opponents, and at the end of the game there is a technology that can allow movement through "half-wormholes," which can lead to an unfriendly force swooping in on the unprepared.

The ship designs are a rather clever lift from the Master of Orion video game series and feel like an important and interesting part of the game without being overly fiddly.  Also meriting attention is the technology system which at the same time rewards specialization by providing tech discounts, but gives flexibility by making all techs in the pool available to one who is willing to pay the price.

Like any ambitious effort there are potential flaws.  A common complaint I've heard (including from some players in my game) was that alien ship parts are simply too powerful, and that perhaps it shouldn't be possible for someone to explore next to your home system, happen upon an advanced drive, and suddenly be able to mass a large fleet on your doorstep.  Also the tech availability is more mechanical than thematic - why can't I have antimatter cannons when I'd be willing to pay extra to focus my research on them?  Someone else discovered them first, and there simply aren't any more available?

Still, Eclipse does a lot right, and with as many headwinds as a design in this genre has, I am willing to overlook the flaws.  This game does a lot (if not all) of what I want Twilight Imperium to do, in 1/3 the play time.  That ensures Eclipse will see a lot of time at my table in the near future.

2-9 players (best 3-5). 4X space-themed game with asymmetric factions. Combines many euro elements with dice combat. The way technology comes out randomly can make the game too luck dependent and sometimes it can be clear who the winner is with 2+ hours left in the game (this gets worse with higher player counts). Also, I feel alliances are unnecessary and can make the game less fun. I would just remove them altogether.

It's funny the first time I played this I thought this was closer to a Euro than Ameritrash.  After my second play I really felt a bit different.  Random dice, Random Explore tiles, Random Alien Techs, Random VP chit pulls, and Random insertion of Techs on the market all point more toward an Ameritrash feel. 

I enjoyed my play more with three players and I'm thinking this is primarily due to the game length.  Random elements are okay but when you have that many in a four plus hour game my tolerance begins to waiver.  The most defined random event is the explore tile pull.  This can make a huge difference in a game paticularly with inexperienced players.  Those new to the game don't know any better but folks with a few games under their belt realize that they probably need to target the fortunate player(s).

Randomness aside this is a brilliant game.  A three player game with folks who have played a few times shouldn't run more than two or two and a half hours.  This scratches the MOO 2 itch for me...and that's saying a lot for me.   

***Update***
I've spent a considerable amount of time and money on this game. I've played virtually every expansion and seen most of what it has to offer to date.  The game certainly has flaws.  The best advice I can give to a new player is win your first battle.  That first battle it typically with a weak alien ship.  Defeat it...make sure you do because if you lose you'll spend the next few hours attempting to catch up.  It typically won't end well for that person.  Flaws aside, this game is outstanding.  How the techs work and the upgrading of the ships and the variable alien races all works so well for me.  Bumping this game up as best in class amongst 4X games that I've played.  Know though that my opinion is in the minority for much of my gaming group.  This is more of a testament for their dislike of 4X games than for this title specifically.

Super fiddly game that isn't easy to grasp until you've played a game. I usually NEVER like anything that is popular here and this is no exception as this is "Puerto Rico" on steroids and in space.

RATING: 9
I'm generally not a systems buff. I put much more weight on the feel of a game than the cleverness of its internal workings.

Eclipse, though, nails the flow of running your little 4X-ing faction so well that while the game can occasionally feel a bit dry and mechanical, and while the sessions can run long and have lots of downtime during big endgame battles for non-combatants, its systems are genuinely so enjoyable to work with that they easily make up for the downsides.

Eclipse manages to avoid the trap of being a thematic paste job on top of soulless Euro-style resource management, and while I wouldn't call it "epic" in space operatic terms, the theme and the American-style hybrid elements still make the game more than the sum of its parts. The theme is meaningful and playing the game just feels really good, easily carrying as much as a six-hour game of new players without breaking a sweat.

Combined with a very competently handled sci-fi space theme and vast replayability (even more so with expansions), Eclipse is easy to love. It's not quite a ten, overall, but it's a confident nine.

A game of Eclipse places you in control of a vast interstellar civilization, competing for success with its rivals. You will explore new star systems, research technologies, and build spaceships to wage war with. There are many potential paths to victory, so you need to plan your strategy according to the strengths and weaknesses of your species, while paying attention to the other civilizations' endeavors.

Eclipse is the quintessential 4x experience. The decision space is perfectly balanced--wide enough to allow for a vast array of viable strategies, but narrow enough to remain accessible and minimize AP. The theme comes through brilliantly, and the visual presentation is stunning. Gameplay is dynamic, highly strategic, and rewards advanced planning. Even the various random elements play a key role in testing players' skill level and adaptability (i.e., you can't rely on a single strategy every game). These elements also add layers of surprise and replayability without compromising strategy. This game is a phenomenal achievement.

If you play this like chess, with your geek friends, then it takes to long time. And since there is quite little interactions (due to the "alliance-part") you should not be more then four players.

And the boardgame design with all the discrete instructions is top class, makes it very easy to understand!

Explore. Develop. Conquer. There are plenty of strategies to choose from -- so long as you have the currency to cover the expenditure. Poor exploration or being forced into energy expenditure early can really hurt you, but what's more bothersome is the downtime as you have to wait for everyone else to do one action before you do another... and if you pass early, you are stuck waiting longer.

An admirable design that I think hits the sweet spot for a 4X title in a way that TI3 could only dream of doing. The tradeoff is that everyone is a playing what amounts to a nameless, faceless civilization--I wish it had some more differentiation, but having that and game balance is easier said than done.

There's very little downtime, and I was impressed by the integration between the actions and upkeep costs. I'm curious how much less time a 4P game would take (as opposed to 5P). The randomness of the payouts from exploration draws is bound to bother some people, but I had no problem with that. My downfall is that I'm just not very good at identifying quick ways to get efficiency engines set up (income, research, etc).

It might have a smidgeon too much Eurogame feel to it, but ultimately I think I've determined that I just don't like the 4X genre very much.

RATING: 7
Space themed Euro economic/military game. Some very interesting innovations:
 
- ship configuration. Being able to customise your fleet is cool. You feel that you are adding your unique touch to the ships and providing them with a bit of personality. 

- worker/action cost calculation mechanism. The complex calculation of resources, science and money are handled in a really tidy way. The only downside here is in game setup - where each player has tens of blocks to position. Also there is the 'nudge' factor! With so many pieces one small knock can make it hard to recall where everything was.

While I like this game, something about it falls a little flat. It's not a patch on TI3, which is a completely different beast with the same theme. I think the Euro elements actually make the game feel too mechanical. I like building an economy, but the options of how to build an economy are too limited - I have to expand, an there is too much luck of the draw in the early game - a good system drawn early gears your economy immediately; whereas an early empty or ancient heavy system is a heavy penalty to suffer. TI3 handles this better, allowing players to choose how their local sectors are mapped (albeit at the loss of exploration). 

I also feel Eclipse is weighted slightly too much towards early military rushes. If your neighbour begins to build new ships, you are forced to drop your economic build and instead focus on defence. I dislike being forced away from the game I want to play: I feel the game should slightly favor a solid economic build over the short-game rush.

The seeded tech-tree doesn't work for me. Too often I find one great technology is seeded that everyone wants to get. I also find myself having limited interest in early technologies when I could get a significantly better tech a turn later. However, this of course relates to my game preference - long game over short. I don't want to research a basic fusion engine, when I could bypass it for an advanced one in the next turn. 

Probably stemming from my wish to take my time and gear my economy before I attack a neighbour, I find I always run out of game turns and am rushed into a big battle. I know many already find the game takes too long, but for me the end is somewhat forced. Another 2 or 3 turns would allow a more natural conclusion. But then I recognise that I would like bigger fleets - more epic battles, more options for ship configuration etc. 

Overall, I feel the game is good, but short of great. There is something missing. Too much luck, not enough real choices, and too much advantage given to those who build early-game mini fleets with early-game (inefficient) tech improvements. This frustrates, as the elegant strategist should be able to outwit the route-one hoard in a well design game.

Well, most of the top rated games on bgg I do like, but this is not one of them. I have one word for this game: Boring!
A players progress moves along at a snails pace, everyone is very aware of how well every one else is doing-- which means there is no mystery going into the final round of play-- this mystery is something I very much enjoy in games. The main strategy in this game revolves around the players ability to equalize out their recources so that by the final round they may actually have some ships to recon with. This means the entire game is a solitaire one until the final round when you finally have some player ineraction. Anyways, I hope I don't get sucked into playing this game again, by my friends. What makes it even worse is: my friends have analysis paralysis, so the game lasts three hours. I could almost enjoy the game if it were only an hour and a half.

RATING: 2.8
I think there are better Ameritrash games out there, that are nowhere near this high a rating (#5); it's the one game in the Top 10 that I don't think belongs there. Rampant Cult-of-the-New.  It does have nice theme implementation and attention to thematic details, but game design not so much.

Issues:
-Too much luck for a 4 hour game
-Too much downtime.
-Runaway loser problem; potentially a runaway leader problem too. (38, 31, 31, 30, 15, 5 in my one 6-player game.)
-Exploring part is too luck-heavy which then over-influences the rest of the game.
-While it was fun building ships and upgrading them, it wasn't fun running into the storm of missles my neighbor had, some kind of crazy unbalanced upgrade he had that blew up all 5 of my ships without me even getting to roll a die in response.  Realistic (in the sense that some empires historically have militarily obliterated others), maybe. Fun, not.  Think Hiroshima & Nagasaki.  So, some major balance issues in the tech. 

I do give them props for having easier rules to learn than TI3.  But, for this type of flavor and game-play I'd pick Galactic Emperor any day, plus at 90 minutes I'd get to play at least a whole 2nd game of something
in the same time.

Ok, lots going on but it all makes sense and the game flow is good. 4 Player game with 3 new players all human took 2.5 hours. The game is excellent and I immediately want to play again : )

*6 plays* This game just keeps on getting better and the expansion is excellent. The rules are internally consistent and intuitive and each game is tense and plays out surprisingly differently. One of my favourite games that I will always look to play.

I love the way the different mechanisms work together intuitively and create an easy experience to get into and enjoy. At the same time, it's deep and complex and satisfying to wrap your head around for a number of hours. Upgrading ships, buying tech, building your economic engine, mitigating dice rolls, planning out your actions to expand your empire and maximize VPs is just fantastic. I can't recommend Eclipse enough.

RATING: 7
I'm really really in two minds about this game. 

Pros:
The economic aspect of the game is beautiful... so simple but so effective.  The debt mechanics are ingeniously balance.  As a whole, all the stuff on the player's board works beautifully: the modular ships, the research track and the concessions for investing in one particular line of research.  Likewise: the exploration, the numerous ways to gain VP etc. all make for compelling stuff and immerse you in a really galactic experience...

BUT

Cons:
Eclipse is a tease! sure you can play it safe, but how will that give you the edge when your opponents build a menacing armada on the fringes of your empire? Do you risk it and head into the middle? what are the odds on beating those ancients guarding the handsome cluster of planets you so desperately need? Therein lies the problem: get the lucky dice rolls and you'll be smiling your way through... roll snake eyes and prepare to watch your opponents gobble up all the nice things on the board for the next 3 hours.  The moral seems to be "play it safe and you'll muddle along. Play it dangerously and you'll either roar to victory or spend the rest of the game licking your wounds".
Oh, yeah, and missiles are stupidly OP.  build yourself Kamikaze missile gun boats with the cheapest ships and watch as your opponents fry...

So much good in one box!  So far the highest evolution of the boardgame that I've experienced to date.  Has elements of so many previous games, but is better than all of those games.  The majority of my games are 2-player affairs with very little combat due to a natural tendency to react to your opponents ship build.  Both of our ships end up being built to combat or counteract the benefits of your opponents ships.  This makes it a very risky endeavour to attack your enemy in a 2 player game - unless they didn't respond to your recent upgrade to Antimatter Cannons, mwahahaha!  So good and so much tension!  Love it

Now it's final. 4x games are not my type of game. Within two weekends I played this and TI3 for the first time and both were merely ok. While Eclipse has the advantage of clever Euro-inspired mechanisms and a more manageable playtime, TI3 tells more of a story and I like the achievement-based victory condition better. But in the end, the intrinsic deficits of the genre such as turtling, kingmaking, high randomness of exploration and battles will never let me indulge in games as these.

I enjoyed my first game. It does a good job of capturing the build/expand/explore idea in a reasonably short time, especially if people make decisions and play quickly. If it bogs down in AP, not so fun. Lots of variability, but I'm still a bit undecided whether the galaxy layout dictates strategy (or just hoses a player over) too much.

After a third game, I've decided the game is too variable on a few key random events (e.g. race, early planets) and I don't enjoy a multi-hour game determined by random events in the first thirty minutes.

It's a tight, well-produced, board game representation of a PC Game-type I love.  It's table-top 4x (Civ II, SMAC, MoO, MoM).  Just Awesome.  I need to play this more.  

Feels more like a pure euro in a lot of respects though.  I could see how that's less interesting for some players.

Provisional rating of 9 after two games (1 2p, 1 3p). Eclipse is an extremely clean and well-designed hybrid Euro/Ameritrash "solution" to the 4X problem. After the first couple of plays, and these not even at the likely optimal number of players (guessing four), everything seems to click and pretty much everything seems to work. Like most hybrids, it's best not played as a conquest game--see Space Empires: 4X and others for such--but rather as an economic efficiency engine. Components are very well done and, in 2012, pretty lavish for the price point (can you imagine FFG giving six-player potential out of the base-set box?). Gameplay is tight and tense. While it takes (or at least takes me) about 30-45 minutes to explain the game to those who haven't read the rules, by a round or two everyone seems to get it. Initial playtime of 45 to 60 minutes per player should decrease some. (My second, 3p, game played a bit shorter than my first 2p game.) Lots of tough and interesting choices here. Highly recommended.

By no means a short game when learning / teaching the rules but very rewarding and play length will improve with repeated plays which is where its' strength lies - a deep game which can comfortably fit into an evening.

Not a fan of the cube and resource tracks on the player sheets and the pool of upgrade tokens needs to be stored 'off the board' - not the most practical design in the universe!

Repeated plays will determine longevity.

Pros - The research and upgrade options are second to none.  Great balance and asymmetry across factions.  Multiple point scoring mechanisms seems to be very even as well.

Con - The dice combat is MADDENING if you are competitive.  I can't figure out if the game is flawed, or if I am flawed for not being able to lose graciously due to bad luck.

Conclusion - Excellent game but it is less than perfect fit for me.

RATING: 5

These are my issues:

:thumbsdown: The ease of being able to set hexes so they don't allow invasion.

:thumbsdown: The fact that the GCD's are found randomly and so if you first set up your borders to not be invaded, you then can explore at your leisure, attack the GCD's at your leisure, and still get reputation tiles. If I ever was to play again, that's the first house rule I'd make, no reputation tiles for fights against GCD's.

:thumbsdown: The diplomacy rules encourage turtling even more. Oops, can't fence off your neighbors? Offer them an ambassador early in the game when they desperately need money. This works particularly well if you are on a 1 VP tile, as it doesn't make sense for your neighbor to take a -2 hit on a risky combat.

:thumbsdown: Attacking is really penalized in this game. Someone moves into your hex, you just upgrade and add to your stack. 

:thumbsdown: If you attack someone, win and get damaged, the next guy comes along, attacks you before you're able to build back up, she gets damaged, next guy comes along attacks her before she can build up ad nauseum.

:thumbsdown: Too many tiles (and yes we reduced the III tiles to the proper amount). This encourages turtling and discourages attacking as the tiles aren't worth much anyway. You get plenty of points attacking GCD's, why take on a high risk battle with a player (or at least until the end of the game).

There are a lot of good games out there. I'm fairly sure I could house rule this one to death or just go and play a game that works for me/our group out of the box.

Note that I do not play with the same people from session to session, so whatever is on the table is what is played. By that I mean that there's no "hey get Jennifer because she won last week" no meta gaming, stuff like that. It's very likely that the players have just met in fact. Thematic/Ameritrash games seem to work best when you have a set of friends who know each other fairly well and who want to play a game. That's not the situation that I'm in. Most times players don't know each other well at all. Had I realized it was more of a thematic game, I would not have bought it.

I can sort of understand the appeal of the game. If you like science fiction, it delivers a pretty big experience within a manageable play time.  But ultimately it's too big of a game for me. The length of the game is excessive, especially with the big luck of the draw in planets. Down time becomes more annoying as the game progresses. Also, the plasma cannon thing seems close to broken to me. I know that others feel differently, but at least in our group there was no good way to combat ships like these.

The most notable thing about the game is the rabid fanbase that created a huge demand for the game - I ended up getting rid of both copies of the game within hours of listing them.

A space exploration game. My favourite part is the spaceship designing mechanism that works and isn't overwhelming. Unfortunately the game just doesn't have that "something" that makes games like TI3 stand out. The rest of the game just came off a little too thinky and Euro.

Eclipse feels somewhat like a board game version of the likes of Master of Orion or Galactic Civilizations.  The game is one part Euro economic engine as you manage your empire's economy, and another part dudes on a map as you explore, customize your fleet, and invade your neighbors.  I really wish I had more people to play this with as it is a great game but it unfortunately doesn't really shine with just 2 players.

RATING: 7
A mechanically and thematically strong offering that takes parts from ameritradition and eurogaming and adds these together. Basically this is Civilization in space. Biggest positive for me is the super clear user interface with differently shaped tiles to differentiate uses and the player board controlling player's actions, tech and fleet. I also think that the technologies and races have been really thought out properly, although the gamble with Plasma Missiles may be a bit broken. The big issue for me is the epic battling occurring in the last round. This is unfortunately typical for this kind of games as there's no penalty for losing as the in-game future ends. However, the game has evolved from late prototypes to the published version on the diplomacy side which nicely lessens the end game all-in behavior. Further smaller issue for me is that I can sense the game being a bit scripted in long term. I'd like to see the designer using this user interface also in more games in the future.

Only played a solo playthrough of 3 players.  I like the mechanic of managing resources and trying to optimize your # of turns every round without strecthing yourself too thin.

RATING: 10
I love Eclipse, and it is even better with the Rise of the Ancients expansion. The design is beautiful and deeply intuitive, and the theme is perfectly realized. It just feels good to play, and the customizable ships are a delight to toy around with. 

In comparison to my other favorite economy-focused Euro, Terra Mystica, I feel that Eclipse offers a lot more immediate and accessible fun, without as much room to grow as Terra Mystica offers. On my first time playing Eclipse, which was also the first time for the three other people present, 3/4ths of us scored in what is considered the "good" range according to the forums here, where our (and one other's) scores at the end of our first Terra Mystica game were all significantly lower than the agreed-upon "good score" range.

Eclipse feels right, is deeply enjoyable, and has enough depth to keep your mind ticking. It also lasts exactly as long as it needs to. A great game.

---

One addition: whenever Eclipse is brought up in a discussion of games that are "overrated," the complaint is usually made that Eclipse isn't as 4X-ish as it supposedly purports to be, or that it is insufficiently Civ-like. I don't think it is particularly Civ-like, but it doesn't need to be—taken on its own terms, without having to compare the quadrant exploration to terrain expansion in a typical 4X, it's a lovely game that is, yes, very much an economic Euro while also having lovely space-themed flavor, and just enough map creation and exploration to spice up the mix.

RATING: 5
Economic snowball engine... in space! And with much randomness. A poor tile draw could see you boxed in or slowed down and in for a long time of waiting to lose in either case, while combat VPs reward those who get off to a good start. After one play this doesn't seem like a TI3 substitute to me, as there's basically no politics but instead a queer focus on spaceship tech upgrades, as well as various elements typically attributed to soulless Euros such as multiple currencies that can be spent towards the same mechanical goals and abstract VPs that are awarded for basically everything. You're not expanding an empire and generating narrative, but placing cubes to spin your tech snowball faster: several players could sit in their respective corners of the galaxy for a few hours, generate points in whichever ways, experience plenty of down time and ultimately not achieve much of substance. Perhaps I'd have to play TI3 more to see if these are things that really set the two games apart. Rating for this could go either way.

Update: Rating going down because it's just so long for what it ultimately offers. I'm open to the possibility that multiplayer politics can work well with experienced players but they haven't really in any of my games. Risk aversion, scoring uncertainty and punishing mechanics all work against informed, let alone coordinated, action.

An epic 4x space empire builder, with the biggest draw being the awesomely fun spacecraft design, supported by an intuitive and deep economic engine and clever relationships between all facets of the game. Tense space battles, politics and tonnes of exciting decisions to be made. Achieving victory by various methods is great.

The only issues keeping it from a ten are:
- random tech generation is a bit un-thematic (although it's important for replayability) and
- the random and confusingly secret "reputation" tiles for victory in combat. Randomness is good but the battles have enough of that without making the spoils random too: a puny weak player can still draw half of the "4" VP tiles...

I like it, but I absolutely do not love it as much as some people appear to. It is a worker placement game in its heart. I am not sure why people think the space theme is strong in this game, but to each their own. In my opinion, it is a worker placement civ-building game. There is a well designed tech tree and customizable aircraft blueprint is just awesome. The problem with this game is that it gets samey very quick. There is only one playable strategy with the weaker alien races, and you can play however you like with the stronger races and still win. So in a six player game you are guaranteed to see the expanding races getting ganked by the weaker races. Then the tech race slowly becomes so good and they get ganked. and The Empire will sit boring at the table waiting for it to end(unless you play aggressively from the beginning and be reasonably lucky).

I've played this once. I did not care for it. The economic aspects of the game are interesting, but the game moves too slowly for what it is. The combat is tedious, and the exploration and play interaction doesn't allow for a lot of creative strategies. This is not my kind of game.

RATING: 10
All those "bad" reviews saying this game was basically a resource management euro set in space made me really want to try it, and I'm glad I did.  It took a few plays to see how all the different systems interact, particularly vis a vis combat, but what emerges is a nice hybrid design that combines the streamlined mechanics of a euro with the direct player interaction and immersive theme of an ameritrash game.  And it's actually playable in 2-3 hours!  On the negative side, the game takes up a LOT of table space, so much that I've had to pull out a second table just to accommodate a 4 player game (for comparison's sake, my usual table can fit a 5 player game of agricola albeit tightly).  And although the graphic design is excellent, the artwork, if not bad per se, is a bit uninspiring.  But overall, a current favorite, and a rating that could rise with more plays.

Update:  I've upped this to a 9 (from an 8).  A current favorite, and after 10 or so plays, feels like there's a LOT left to explore.  I just wish we could finish a game in under 3 hours lol.

approximate number of plays (pre-2017):  10

Great fun game, my favourite of the games from 2011. Doesn't play quite as well with 2 as 4 though. No way i would consider trading this as it just works so well in a shorter time than TI3 or other space games of the type.

Comparing it to T3I isnt entirely Sensible ofc, this is more of a resource management game with some combat thrown in. 

Plus Eclipse Pulsar, Nebula, Supernova, Black Hole

It's a fairly fun game, but too much set-up/learning involved to get this going. It makes it a little daunting to bring out and actually get a game going. 

Game's also terrifying in the amount of components and how easy it is to nudge pieces off or lose track of them. Picked up a set of population trays, hopefully that helps.

Once you get players familiar with this game though, it moves well, and then it's just the fear of pieces getting lost that's left.

Update after an incomplete two-player game.  The tech tiles that are available and the systems/planets that are explored shape the strategies available to the players.  Some may not like the randomness, but I think this provides replayability and a good challenge.  There are a lot of decisions to make in this game and several strategies available.  It's a lot of fun to discover the interactions between the game systems.

Initial rating based on solo play to learn rules.  Seems like a fairly good Civ/4x game.  The rules are easy to learn, and after a couple of rounds, remember.  If I had 4 to 6 players and a few hours, this would be a good game to play.

Generic 4X game, focused much more on rivalry & player interactions then realism but does it's job very well. Highly recommended.

Most likely, you will like this game more than I do.  It is a slickly produced game.  I was impressed by the production values, and the careful thought that went into how the various game elements meshed together.  The economic system is pretty cool, and well thought out.

For me, the first half of the one game I've played was entertaining.  But the game is ultimately an expand and explore sort of game, which rewards success.  So after a while, it becomes clear who is in the hunt, and if you are not, it is unlikely you can do much about it.

I'm a minority opinion around here with regard to these sorts of games.  Go for it, you'll probably love this game!

Fun 2P even though we danced around combat for a bit. Only major let down was in exploration. Was hoping for a little more excitement in that department.

Although this is likely only an issue when playing 2P.

Includes the Expansions:

Eclipse: Nebula (2014)

CRITIQUE OF ECLIPSE
Eclipse is a 4x (explore, expand, exploit, exterminate) game set in its own fictional universe. It includes plenty of exploration, expansion and extermination, but exploitation seems to have gotten lost in the shuffle. It plays anywhere from two to six players, which is always a plus for me, since I never know how many people are going to show up.

Setting up the game is a beast. First, this is a "hexes on the table" game, so if you don't have some sort of mat down on the table you are going to regret it. Second, there are so many different kinds of counters that it is a feat to stack them all up and keep them straight. Once you bring this game to the table (and it had better be a LARGE table) you are committed. There will be no easy transitions to other games.

Managing your alien species is a fairly straightforward Euro civilization game. You have three different things you are trying to advance: production, research and of course your economy. Each is handled exactly the same way: colonize a planet of that color, put a cube on it, advance that track. Easy. While it looks daunting, even non-gamers get the hang of this very quickly.

The thing is, once you expand a bit, you come into contact with other aliens who are also expanding their empires. This is where the game really gets interesting. I love the posturing, the diplomacy, the bluffing, the outright attacks, the backstabbing, and everything else that happens here. It is so well done. If you use the expansion you can even form alliances, making joint attacks against a common enemy.

Combat is handled using lots of dice, which I am not fond of. Still, without the randomness of combat the game would fail. Basically you are weighing the offense, defense and speed of your ships against those of other players, and it's nearly impossible to create a "balanced" fleet. The dice let you play out the battles fairly quickly to determine a winner.

I didn't like the way tech wasn't scaled according to the number of players, so I made a variant. In the original game, the fewer players the more random the tech draws became. Using a variant I get the same amount of randomness regardless of the number of players.

All in all, Eclipse is a great space-themed 4x game. It overstays its welcome a little, and there is a bit too much downtime for me to rate it a 10. Also, unless you play with alliances there is no catch-up mechanic. Once someone gets vastly superior ships they can simply own the board. It's not so much fun playing a game for three or four hours when it's obvious after 90 minutes that you aren't going to win.

Other things I really enjoy are the variable player powers, the modular expansions, and the fact that you could tailor the game to suit your group of players. I am happy to have this game in my collection.

I can see why others like this game, but personally its just not for me and my gaming group. A few negatives we found that deter us from playing again:
- Long setup time with all of the upgrade tiles and discovery tiles. This must game must have one of the longest setup times of any game I've ever played.
- Long play time (expect your first game with 3-4 people to take over 3 hours easily)
- A lot of turtling since attacking one player can leave your bases vulnerable to anther player from a different angle.

This game has seen more gameplay since we got it than any other game I know. It is a very well-designed strategy game, though I don't care much for the sci-fi theme. I find that the game takes a deceptively long time, and the inability to functionally ally with your teammates is frustrating (shouldn't you be able to share space and fight alongside each other?). The dice also frustrate me and I have seen battles that constitute nothing more than rolling dice at each other for 10 minutes. Overall, it IS a fantastic game, I just don't seem to be as thrilled by it as everyone else.

Seems to me the best 4x game so far: Good combination of strategy and abstraction - which I both love in Hegemonic - and details and "oh my gosh" - which I love in TI. The mechanics are beautiful, the game is easily taught and there seems to be no reasons not to love it.

A lot of people moan about luck in this game. To me it seems more important to adapt your strategy to given situations.

has a big downside: it takes a lot of space. Up to 3, fine; but with 4-6 players you need a large table. The board of available technologies is difficult to consult in a game with 3 or more players.

So many things going on in this board game. Even if you're not a fan of the sci-fi genre, overlook this and imagine you're playing a fantasy civ just to enjoy the overall mechanics the game has to offer. Dice rolling offers a simplistic way to resolve combat, and with all of the different techs out there that you can upgrade your ships with, the game rewards strategists enough to overcome dice rolling variance. Each alien race feels and plays differently. Tons of replay value in this one. Early setbacks and poor planet exploration knock this otherwise excellent 4X game. Suggested with no more than 4 players due to play length and potential downtime. New players will be severely subject to AP.

Love it so far - it's everything I want from a civ game. Never played without the expansions (and never will), added few houserules to mitigate luck and turtling.

Additionaly, I feel like promo/expansion tiles add a lot to the game - without them, the galaxy tiles feel quite one-dimensional, with only 3 quite similar types of tiles (planets/discoveries/ancients).

I give it a cautious (yet enthusiastic) 9 for now. Will upgrade after I get more games in.

Downgraded due to discovery luck factor - some discoveries sway the game result way too much for my taste. Will play future games with the alien tech discoveries removed.

I've played Eclipse many, many times. I've just re-discovered this game after not playing it for a year or so. It's just so good! No other game manages to put this epic scale into a very manageable time frame. You have the constant impression of progress and at the end of the game, you really have created an empire! This game is just so extremely satisfying to play! 

This is the best Ameritrash-Euro hybrid on the market.

It's only problem, is a perceptual one: People on the Ameritrash side of the spectrum might find it too dry and restrained. People on the Euro side might find too random and combat-heavy. 

But if you are open for a good mix of the best of the two worlds, this is the game for you. Rated 10 in the honeymoon phase and very pleased to rate it 10 now (3 years later) and forever!

Don't let others fool your: Eclipse isn't Twilight Imperium. While aesthetically similar, the strengths of each are radically different. In particular, Eclipse is mostly focused around economy and space combat, while Twilight Imperium has a much larger emphasis on diplomacy.

Differences aside, Eclipse would be an instant favourite if not for a single reason: I detest the technology draws. I tend to love games which force players to adapt, but I want that necessity to arise from the actions of your opponents, not because a bag forces you to do so.

It's a pity, because all the other elements are great. I love how you must balance your economy and how ship customization enriches combat. But I can't get over the super random tile draws.

Nice SciFi themed battle game that can be fun because of its "Master of Orion" style. Very luck dependent because if you only draw bad systems without money as the most important resource, you will never catch up to the others. The other problem is that you have so many techs but often not the time to implement all those techs into your ships. And if you manage to do that most fights are very long bescause you only hit on "6" - most times shields and computers counter each other so you still end up on "6" on a six sided die...

Wonderfully elegant mechanics for a 4X/Civ game. Plays fast(er than TI) but still feels like a real game of that scope. Art and ships could be sexier, only minor quibble (oh, and availability). Not broadly accessible as the theme and play time is still pretty nerdy. Plays well with 2 to 6 - lots of playing with ship bits (a la Galaxy Trucker)

A great game about space exploration and domination. Can be a lengthy game, but it's worth the time and usually there is suspense until the very end. 
My only drawback is the individual player boards. In this game you use MANY tiny cubes to keep track of your econony and resources and so it is very easy to lose track of everything, as if you accidentally scuff your board it will all become a clutter. It should have something to keep everything in place. Fortunately you can buy custom made overlays. 
A highlight in the game for me is the ability to upgrade and customize your ships, for example make them more potent in combat or make them more mobile. 

A solid 9.0!

Solidly designed low-moderate complexity space civ game. Mechanics are very sound, tech advancement very slick. My principal complaint is that technology and game winning status is very, VERY focused on conquest. Cultural, scientific and artistic achievements are a footnote. Also, while replayability appears good, I can see the basic process of research, expand, conquer and eventual backstab getting tiresome. It's really about the combat, and it would be nice to see a space civ game where that wasn't the only option.

05-28-2013 - I thought this was going to be the one game to rule them all from what I had heard about it.  My current favorites are the 4X type, and the theme just seemed to put it over the top into awesome-land.  After two games, I just think it could have been better.  I'm not sure how exactly, maybe it was just because I had it so built up in my mind.  I guess, for instance, I don't feel like the planets offer variety or tangible-feeling benefits.  I place a cube here and now I have money...  How about some ore to turn into money?  Maybe that's a stupid idea and would just make the whole game overly complicated, there is plenty else going on.  More plays will probably raise it in my list and give me a better feel for for what it is and how good it is at accomplishing its goals as a game.  I certainly haven't given up on it, I'm really excited to get play more and figure out the nuances of play.

06-11-2013 - I've started to feel-out what this game is all about, and it's pretty awesome.  But HARD.  I'm not very good at it.  Especially when I get stuck in a rut, like never drawing any Money hexes.  I believe there are ways out of such ruts, but I've been having a heck of a time figuring them out.  Until I feel sufficient at this game, I'm afraid it'll remain a 7.  Though if scoring for design alone, I'd probably score it higher.

I love this game. It is hard to get to the table. It lasts a while, and while the rules are easy to remember and quite elegant, there are a lot of them. The game, however, is deeply strategic, with many avenues to victory and very interesting decisions presented at all points.

Enjoyable game with a lot of variability. After 4 2-player games (the last of which I finally won!), it has stayed fresh and intense. Balance is very good: there's strong weapons, yes, but you can counter with shields and missiles. You can build a fearsome armada or cause back-rank havoc with a swift fleet. Tactics in the game vary too: you can explore and try to avoid conflict, and technology and military allows you to build up even when you're geographically constrained. The hard part in this game is money management -- it's such a key internal struggle and one that's hard to master. Armed conflict is almost unavoidable, especially if you have a belligerent neighbor. But rarely does the game become so one-sided that someone gets steamrolled and eliminated. More often, mismanagement of money causes a player to undermine their own empire. Fun, but very long (2-3 hours) and tons of setup due to the numerous pieces.

Enorme juego 4X, balanceado en todas sus estrategias y de una amplitud exagerada de posibilidades de victoria, además de altísima rejugabilidad. Y sobresaliente como gestor de recursos. Solo la presencia tan decisiva de los dados en las batallas le separa de la perfección.

Rating should increase if my group can get this to the table. we can't because it takes too long.
I think 45 minutes a player is more correct. 

Explore,Expand,Exploit, exterminate



Somehow it feels like a more developed risk. Be in control of your civilisation (not only money but also resources) build up a decent army . And just go for it. You will have the most fun.

a comment about weight. despite that you have a plethoria of options how to play and each game will be unique . I think weight it is a medium light game.

There is not a single action that is confusing. (most difficult part are the missiles but that one 
even is a piece of cake to explain)

Despite it being a light game in my book and despite it's playing time. (you could argue it is too light for the time investment you have to make)
playing it was just great fun. 

So much infact that I'll acquire this on my ipad next time it goes on sale. And I probably acquire a boardgame copy for myself too. so I can pull it out even if that means just every two years.
It's totally worth it.

edit: So last week it was on sale on Ipad and I've played around 15 games now.
the second time was with my regulars in a pub. 
Explaining it was easy and it's nice that the Ipad does the bookkeeping. You lack however the physical feel of your workers. I made the mistake of conquering some areas I didn't have workers for to claim. 

About the lasers. Well they are really strong and adapting your playing style to cope with them is harder than to play it yourself. Or you should get the ancient three hull technology soon. 

there is a serious luck element to the game. what areas do you discover and what technologies come up. but they are true to the game. I'm fine with that. some people won't. This means that each game will be different and you have to adjust yourself to the chances.


the races put something new to it but more like in the human race I feel you are depending more on what technologies come up. You have to adjust your playing style accordingly to what your ships are capable of and there is a difference. this makes it more unbalanced. 


About player count well at the moment i really like the three player game that way everybody is involved with everybody. some multiplayer games and most gatewaygames fail at that number. 

Playing this game has got me interested in Twilight Imperium. 
Because the downside to the game is that the feeling of its lightness is confirmed in each play and the game is AP prone. 

The explore action and the right tile make it possible to win a lost fight. that's the biggest downside to me . It makes for an exciting powerswitch though. 

Edit:

I like this  game a lot. It is not the best game I have ever played and it probably takes too long for what it is. The time issue is somewhat solved by playing this on the ipad. I've played it a couple of times in a pub.

what I am telling here  is tha I am unsure of acquiring the boardgame version for myself as the Ipad implementation does a great job.

RATING: 9.5
Minimal, eye-pleasing artwork, lots of tidbits to move around. The first time is engaging. From the second time on, it gets more and more captivating. 
Solid mechanics that make sense. Despite its complexity it appeals to non-gamer video gamers. I've (sadistically) successfully taught it as a first boardgame to a few video gamer friends.
I love the relative quickness of the 2p game and I love the table-filling epicness of the 6p game.
Limited number crunching in the end for human calculators however it's not hugely prone to AP. Some hate the dice aspect of fights. I don't mind - even real fights are hugely governed by luck. All you can do is equip your self to the point where you're near sure to win, or you can risk it and jump in head first. 
Fun game, strongly recommended. This was my first game purchased after Monopoly and Scrabble. I didn't know what I was getting into. What a journey it's been since!

Great game with elegant mechanics which I truly admired the first few times I played it. Each game goes more or less the same: you build up as the luck of the tile draw allows it and then battle it out at the end of the game - mostly for fun, as all players will earn more or less the same VP in battle. The randomness of the initial tile draw can make or break your game and keeps this game from being great.

This is a fantastic game that delivers on being a moderately deep empire development operation on top of being a sweet dudes-on-a-map game. 

The constant arms race dance where ships are upgraded in response to strengths and weaknesses of the other players is what makes this game special. 

Plasma missiles are not even close to broken. A well balanced ship with lots of shields, hulls and computers will best missiles. If I see PM ships coming my way I take extra shields and haven't had a problem with them. In fact I wouldn't ever consider going the plasma missile route unless absolutely desperate.

Based on my one play I can tell this will be a mainstay and a classic. Plays quickly for being as epic as it is, and there is a great depth of strategy without the need for a significant amount of AP concerning forward planning. Time will tell how it holds up, but I'm willing to call it a masterpiece!

A lot of the elements in this game are very similar to Twilight Imperium, but it's just missing the things I want in a space epic.  The aliens are not very well fleshed out in regards to theme, and this is really more of a cube pusher than a game that creates stories.  Sometimes that is what I want, but maybe not in a space epic.

My 2013 birthday present from me.

Holy crap.  Mechanically, there's a lot of stuff I love about this game... but too many times, I've been clearly out of contention by the end of turn 3, and sit there and watch people play for the next couple hours.  Or, cases where you had a 99.2% chance of winning an important fight, and you get [thread=977775]wrecked by the dice[/thread], and are crippled for the rest of the game... that happens to somebody [i]every game.[/i]  So I bring it to the table when people demand it, but always with a feeling like I'm about to get kicked in the nuts for three hours.

The Rise of the Ancients expansion has a lot of good/maybe-even-necessary stuff.

Gave to Dan.

UPDATE: Having played with house rules numerous times, stock rules feel more and more terrible. I probably won't agree to play stock eclipse ever again.

I've been watching the game evolve and managed to get glimpses of it while it was still under playtesting. I felt I have to get to try it, it looked so good. Now I own my copy, just played it for the first time and how do I feel? Well, its a mixed bag. I found a lot of very nice mechanics, a lot of interaction, and a nice balance between actions and option the players have. I also found lots of luck involved, with a bit more luck and a little more luck.

The dice rolling is obvious. Its hard to feel good when your opponent luckbags 1 out of 36 shot with one try against your 1 out of 3 with two tries. There is no good fix for this, so I grudgingly have to accept it. The hex drawing is another thing. Getting only ancient tiles at the beginning is huge disadvantage, and having to discard explored tiles even more so. Finding ancient treasures is also purely luck, and they are not in balance. Pulling the reputation tiles from the bag is also totally random. By sacrificing one interceptor, a player might earn 4 VP where the winner gets just 1 VP. Drawing the tech tiles from the bag to table is also completely random.

Game rules are very well written!

We have now played several games with the following house rules, and the game works IMO much better:

1) Each hex stack is turned upside-down. This lets every player know where they are exploring to. This basically kills the luck factor in hex drawing.

2) Instead of placing discovery tiles face down, place discovery tiles face up. This reduces unnecessary randomness and lets you plan how large risks and / or sacrifices you should be willing to take to get the tile. 

EDIT: Also the ancient tech tiles are way OP. Either remove them, or make the following arrangement: Put all discovery tiles face up on the table, and use them normally on discovery hexes. When a player is awarded a discovery tile, he may take tile of his choosing for the discovery tile stack instead of having to take the tile on the hex with the following restrictions: If the hex had one or less ancient ships, the player may take any discovery tile but technology. If the hex had two ancient ships or more, he may choose any discovery tile.

We have decided to rather play without the tech tiles.

3) Instead of drawing reputation tiles from the bag, put 5 reputation tiles face down on the table. After each combat, the combatant who gets to draw most tiles ("the winner") draws his from these 5, chooses one and returns the rest which are then shuffled. Then the rest combatants draw theirs in the same "most-order" manner. When everyone has drawn his tile, the tiles are restocked face down to 5. This greatly reduces the randomness in combat victory points, and rewards the winners of large battles.

4) Instead of randomly drawing the tech tiles from the bag, just make them all available at the start of the game (and ban hydran race), or make X/2 of each tile rounded up available at the start of the game, where X is the number of players (and still ban hydrans). 

5) Ships need to have a VP value at the end of the game. Perhaps small, but anything that prevents the optimal strategy for the last round: Get into as many combats as possible with all of your ships, to draw as many reputation tiles as possible, and usually decide who wins the game. EDIT: Starbases and interceptors ½ VP, cruisers 1 VP, and battleships 1½ VP, count ship VP's together, and round up.

With our house rulings, I rate the game at 8.

After all the hype the randomly appearing techs, randomly drawn score chits, and the gamey elements arising because of these was a letdown, but then again it might be the right solution for this game, since it's obviously designed to be the "quick Eurostyle 4X". The resource management side of things works great.

The Good: Lots of fun.  Fairly easy to teach.  Comes with a lot of stuff.  The random world generation is captivating.  Coming up with your own ship blue prints is fun.  The different races make it replayable.

The Bad:  takes a LOT of table space!  Setup takes a LONG time.  Tear down takes even longer.  The trailing player doesn't have as much fun.

I like playing this game.  My friends like playing this game.  If there are 4 people and we have the time to play it, and the space, we never say no when somebody says "Want to play Eclipse?"

update:  hasn't had much use because it requires a lot of setup which makes it intimidating for some people.

RATING: 6
First impression: quite interesting. We played (all rookies, 4 players) with only terrans so I haven't seen all the possibilities there is. But what I've seen so far is a resource-tech-wargame with extremely well-done resource-money upkeeping so now you don't have to use time to calculate all the costs. You can use all the time to PLAY (and wait for your turn). Our first game took 140 minutes to finish the whole game which isn't bad and I expect that future games will be faster. The biggest issue here is the last round battles where you can "do what ever you want without care what would happen in the future rounds..." 

Now after more games I have to drop my rating a bit (7->6): even with 30min/player there is too much downtime. There just comes situations where you know your next 1-2 rounds (and I don't mean turns), but you just have to wait quite a while when others are playing. Another issue here is, that the game is too stabile - this really needs more surprises and possibilities for interesting moves.

Euro space game. A game of Eclipse places you in control of a vast interstellar civilization, competing for success with its rivals. You will explore new star systems, research technologies, and build spaceships to wage war with. There are many potential paths to victory, so you need to plan your strategy according to the strengths and weaknesses of your species, while paying attention to the other civilizations' endeavors.

Really elegant design especially with regards to the "book keeping" usually necessary in a 4X game. Not complex but deep. A game that really challenges you to forge ahead somehow someway.

I love Twilight Imperium and don't shutter about a game's length unless I wasn't up for it in the first place.

As a game designer, of coarse I've thought up some space stuff. This came out just as I was thinking what to put in mine to some day rival Twilight Imperium. (I know, fat chance, but set the bar high to reach for the stars) Then I saw a review by the Dice Tower which had me interested, but feel I'm one of those types that will still take Twilight Imperium over Eclipse if I had to choose one to play. Of coarse, that is said without having played it yet.

A straight up replacement to things like Twilight Imperium or Starcraft.  Smarter, faster, funner, comparable scope and depth.  Typical space 4x board game (explore, expand, exploit, exterminate) with sharp, solid euro mechanics, up to par combat and quick play for the genre.  Hard to not recommend assuming the time & learning investment are not a problem.  The dice really hurt this game however.  Combat is very very random can easily result in a stronger force getting wiped by a much weaker force.  I guess you can pursue non combat strategy but it's a very big part of the play.  In a game where little is left to chance and accountability is high, combat resolution has turned out to be a big turn off for me.

RATING: 6
This is just an awesome game that I have been waiting for years. It is the game that Twilight Imperium failed to be. Right now, I think it is the best space conquest strategy game ever made,

It's a real 4X game, which is simple, flexible and expandable. The game really has an Euro-Trash feeling and it is the game that describe this style the best. It's really a combination of exploration and war game with a victory point and action system like euro games.

There is some issues that can be easily fixed without any conflicts. So you might have to make a few adjustments to get the optimal experience. But otherwise, it is a very good game.

-------------------------------------------------------

After playing a few games, the thing I don't like about it is that there is little player vs player conflict. You just build up indefinitely and then the game ends with little chances to fight.

This is due to the fact that you are always short in resources and the non-proportional actions force you to spend a lot of action to attack another player. So it's just easier to just stay where you are.

I intend to make a variant that will make the game more war oriented by adding more resources and making the actions more flexible.

I wish this had been as good as it was supposed to be, but it is plain boring (looking and playing).  I've never been so bored playing a game.  Role two dice and see what you get...I've never seen such boring combat, and that seems to be what you're building up for with your spaceships.  The only fun different things are those tokens that give you either two victory points or a special ability.  The rest of the game is laid out in front of you, buy some really boring upgrades for your ships.  The resources use a very annoying mechanism that takes a lot of calculation.  The exploring is so dull because all you get are some spots to put more cube generators or a really boring fight.

This space thriller is a nice resource managing wargame.  It has a innovative design mechanic of populating control discs and resource cubes.  The income and costs, either rise and fall, depending upon whether you use the discs and cubes proactively or not.  Very creative mechanism that I've not seen yet in any designs of the multitude of games I've played.  The game is long with four players but very good.  It could be great with three as well but I couldn't see myself jumping into a marathon of this with more than four.  Most games with generally come down to the final turn so try to pace yourself on what and how you spend.

RATING: 5
This is my favorite space/civilization game at this point in time.  Nicely streamlined, one can focus on the basics of growing a civilization with a nice touch of being able to specialize how one builds three different types of spaceships.  I sort of wish that there were more models of the bigger ships available, but I suppose that could create balance issues otherwise?  Each civilization also will generally choose to specialize in their techs for other purposes as well.  As you expand, maintenance costs increase dramatically and you also potentially have less actions as you claim more territories.  Make sure to have a strong financial base or bankruptcy can be painful (in the same way, don't fear bankruptcy).  This game is easily taught and learned and can be played very quickly - once everyone knows what is going on, this game could likely be played in 2 hours or so.

Sold after losing interest.  Game took too long around here and seeing someone fare poorly because of poor tile draw for a game this long is painful.

Every ime I play this game I just want to play it again and again! The rules are super tight, and I love the customizing of the ships and the way it makes combat so interesting.

Superior fighting force is just a function of a superior economy. :D

After 1st half of 1st game (2 players):

+ Streamlined rules, with many details represented graphically on the components. Details that are not mentioned are easily found in the rulebook during play. Not many questions (in the 2nd rulebook printing).

- Less of a feeling of variety / epic-ness / flavor in situations than with Magic: the Gathering (dramatic card effects), Race for the Galaxy+first 3 expansions (many different tableaux), Glory to Rome (with the many possible building combos), or Netrunner (strong flavor of many card), or Agricola (with the numerous cards). Maybe things get richer in this department in the second half, when one gets richer, stronger (more attack opportunities), or with more people (alliances, etc.)?

- 1 hour per player for a *half* game on Vassal.

A heap of stuff that blends together marvellously. Witty layout hides all the bookkeeping and does it for you. Slightly intimidating rules that are, however, easy to grasp and make sense. 

Slightly bland art direction and only loosely fitting theme. All the same, very good game.

This game is just amazing, I fell in love after the first couple of plays, the low play time and good balance makes this game one of the best.

Pros:
Actual 4X
Short intense playtime
Random setup much replayability

Cons:
Random setup with pure unlucky draws(happens seldom and some ways around it)

Knocks the other 4X games out of the water.

Finally got to try out one of the new hotnesses of 2012. I like sci-fi as a theme, but sci-fi games tend to come in one flavor: long-ass epic space conquest. New innovations in sci-fi games tend to be: how do we make epic space conquest less long-ass? Now, as someone who isn't much into long-ass games these days, I appreciate the thought, and although epic space conquest kind of isn't my thing, that's largely because it usually came bundled with long-ass. Eclipse is a manageable game for me and I liked a lot about it. I like that the system kept records automatically. I liked that you could get some protection from other players, so you didn't have to fight everyone at the table if you didn't want to. In fact, I liked nearly everything about it. 

Unfortunately, what I didn't like, I didn't like a lot. I didn't like the wildly varying tiles. Every tile I drew at the beginning had aliens on it, which meant I was hemmed in right away. (Oh sure, I could have not placed those tiles and instead simply thrown away my action.) Because I wasn't getting all the goodies others were getting, it took me forever to build up my ships against the aliens so I could finally spread out, but by then I was hemmed in. My only neighbor had gotten lucky with his chit-pulls so he had massive ships -- even if I broke the treaty with him I'd get slaughtered. Meanwhile, another player was sending his small ships into suicidal battles just to get chit pulls. Against my aliens, I got a total of 6 points from chits. He got a lot more from this silly stuff. Luckily I used my tough neighbor as a shield and got monolith tech and thanked the stars other people were giving him a hard time. Also, the final turns consisted largely of people just buying tech they didn't care about for the victory points. 

In the end a lot of this worked against the game for me. I felt like I never really had a chance to play against the other players, as I first got slammed by the game. Then I saw as what got a lot of rewards was dumb losing battles and buying tech for no reason. That just wasn't too exciting for me. (To be fair, the person who won did so by actually performing epic space conquest, but I'm not talking about what wins, I'm talking about what's fun.)

However, there was nothing dealbreaking here, and I'm aware that the randomness of the tiles would mean that the experience would be different in that respect at least.

UPDATE: Another game endeared this to me more, though I still don't know about the victory chits.

I like the science and exploration aspects of this game.  The combat is okay but can take over the game and ruin the feel, descending into an all out war game.

I do not like the mechanic of drawing victory points from a bag.  Way to random.  Kill one fighter and get a 4.  Kill 3 dreadnoughts and end up with a 2.  Terrible.

Not a big fan of how much the tile draws can influence the game. Players can gain a huge advantage by exploring a sector with great planets early. The board layout can also severely hamper player interaction, turning the game into a very bland and boring solitaire Euro.

Sometimes the offtime in the Game is quite long, when waiting for the turn of the other playsers. 
The turnoder has a nice system but sometimes it is a little bit confusing.
The possibility to upgrage the ships give several possibilities, and the upgrades can change the shipd very fast.

It is better than Twilight.

Very deep fun game, but plasma missiles are imbalanced. Also some races are in my opinion stronger than others (hydran and orion). Needs the expansion to be more balanced.

Great components and fantastic gameplay.
This is my Favorite new game of 2011.
The more I play the better the game feels.
Unlike most people I feel luck has Very, very minimal impact on the game. There is many nuance to the game and most people do not know how to work with all the intersecting/intertwined mechanisms and blaming it on luck is easier than admitting failure to grasp this concept.
Except for 2 or 3 players games where I do not recommend using the blue alien race (hydra) as well as green (planta) and yellow (descendants).

RATING: 8
First play completed, 5-player all-Terran game. Has some very appealing features in the technology market, the coupling between influence and upkeep, and the reputation tiles (from here on: 'reptiles') for battles fought. Not much down-time, keeping interest high during the game.

Finished 2nd with 34 vs 35 for the winner, and 24 for the last, and better placement of fleets and actually *not* building monoliths (which just made a juicy target) in stead of a defensive fleet, would have secured me a victory.

Solves many of the problems I had with Twilight Imperium, but retains others. There was a marked tendency towards the final cataclysmic battle reminiscent of TI and Risk, which I think is a bad thing as it comes down to too much die-rolling to find a winner, and draws an fictive line of defense after turn 9, where you won't have to hold what you take.

Will need more plays to see whether the game can deliver, or maybe if our style of play was too defensive. Game tme was something like 3 hours with 1 hour of explaining rules and eating dinner

Initial impressions: my opinions might be biased by the fact that Eclipse might be a bit too heavy for me, but if this really is the definitive 3 hours or less 4X game I am rather disappointed. Don't get me wrong, each aspect of the 4X is implemented to at least a decent amount and the pseudo action point allowance of being punished more and more harshly the more actions you take is quite mechanically sound, but it has all the game weight without the epic feel to back it up. For example, the races all have quite different stats, but as these mostly modify bonus points or how much of one resource you have over another there is an abstraction the thematic nature of these differences, making it feel more like you have different modifiers on an economic engine. There are a ton of different upgrades you can buy, but the economic hurdles you have to face to install them combined with the drabness of the tokens' appearance means the feel is more of the drab logistical aspect of spaceship construction rather than the cool spacefights. I do like though how the upgrades that are available and when they are available change from game to game. Finally, it is possible and potentially profitable to have it be quite difficult for other players' ships to come into contact with yours, making player interaction potentially quite variable (and if interaction is low this adds to the spreadsheet Euro-ness of theg game rather than the 4X feel).

The game also has an issue of throwing a ton of options at you without really guiding you on what you should roughly be doing. This would probably go away with repeated plays, but it would be helpful if I knew if taking that extra action would actually be detrimental to me.

Combat while more exciting than deterministic combat uses the outdated Axis and Allies system of try to roll sixes back and forth until someone has all their ships blown up, with priority rules that only sometimes have a significant impact. In explanation, nothing could be simpler, but in terms of execution it makes battles take forever despite having basically no tactics or strategy after the battle starts. For the point chips you draw after winning the battle, I have no idea why this is randomized and not just predetermined. I know that over the course of the game it probably more or less evens out anyways, but the only thing I can think of of what functionality the randomness serves is it makes it so you don't necessarily know who the winner is until the end of the game.

All the above may make it seem like I disliked the game, but I did enjoy playing it. It's more that it felt like half the time I was playing just another soulless Euro rather than an epic space opera. Enjoyable, but nothing to write home about.

Ok-- needed to play 10+ games to confirm but this is one of the greatest board games ever created.  Complete masterpiece.  Everyone I've played with adores it.  Even having a bad game here and there due to luck is still fun because the key thing here is that it is a Euro AND Ameritrash mash up that really works and that's why it's awesome.

ANOTHER UPDATE.  Two more plays with four, and this game is now up there as one of my all-time favorites.  So much is going on, there are so many decisions to make, and each decision provides a lot to mull over.  The economic engine at its core, and which cleverly forms the basis for how many actions can be taken in a turn, is genius.  The granularity of the techs is perfect.  Your decisions about what techs to research truly affect the course of your game.  Finally, Eclipse provided one of the most cinematic, stand-up moments our group has ever had in gaming.  Pure gaming gold!

UPDATE. After two more plays, one with three and the other with four, my group is still getting the hang of this game.  The biggest learning curve has been with combat.  We still are having some difficulties being able to predict how well our fleets will do against our opponents.  The result has been a couple of games where there is not a lot of combat until the end.  The result has been two games that feel much more like an engine-building euro and less like a true 4x game.  But I suspect that we might be playing a bit too tentatively.

After one play with three, it's too early to rate.  So far, so good, though.  There is a lot going on and a feeling of engine/civilization building.  Maybe it was the fact that there were only three, but in the beginning there was very little tension, although it did begin to mount near the end.  With three there is the potential problem where two players duke it out while the third explores to his heart's content - and the victory.  But that concern might be allayed by some balancing mechanisms, like the alien powers and what appear to be some decent bonuses for attacking (and even being involved in a battle).

I'm enthusiastic about the game.  There is a lot to explore, which should be pretty fun.

Eclipse is not the second coming of 4x as many would have you believe. It is, however, and interesting combination of old ideas. I believe the randomness of exploration and the reputation tiles will turn many players away while others will find ways to overcome those elements to see the neat system that lies underneath.

For me it is the simplicity and clarity of combat and the rules for it. I love the way the tech is handled and that you're not forced into a tree. The game encourages combat (though some would have you believe turtling still rules the day).

Clear rules, good components and an innovative game concept. I like this game.

RATING: 7.5
[microbadge=5][microbadge=419][microbadge=5389]

Eclipse would be very easy to describe as Through the Ages in space, and with a map.  That might do a disservice to the complexities of Eclipse, but it's also bluntly accurate.  The cube system from TtA works well here, supplemented by the addition of "bureaucracy discs", which are spent to push the governing and progressive limits of your empire.  It is possible to lose the game around turn 5 or 6 out of 9, leaving you to carry out the motions of a futile game, but experience can mitigate this.  The alien abilities are all unique, and all worth trying once.  They must be especially commended for not making Humans just the vanilla race; they more than hold their own with their logistic speed and trade efficiency that you'll find yourself missing when playing any of the aliens.

One of my favorite games to play for 4 or more players. Each race plays differently enough to make you strategise for each, but each uses the same mechanics so that one race isn't ALWAYS the best race to play. Everyone who plays this game wants another once we finish. It's still plenty of fun even when you can see you have fallen behind. So many options for you to go.

There are many good Euros that provide a larger set of important decisions for the player in less playing time, but Eclipse has good mechanics and also scratches the combat and exploration itches. Military R&D (technology tiles, ship blueprints) is depicted beautifully and makes the game a standout.  Reasonably accessible, but a real brain burner late in the game when facing multiple threats and unfinished objectives.

UPDATE:  Moves quickly with experienced players. Ancients expansion makes this game a solid 10.

One play and I am impressed by the design.  We played that game with no rules errors and very few rules questions.  The system of actions and their cost is very smooth (even if the set up is a bit awkward) and I am looking forward to more plays.  One part I am less keen on is the dice-based combat system.  It feels random and repetitive - though that is likely in part due to our inefficient and clumsy ship designs.  The rest of the game is exactly what I am looking for.

RATING: 7.25
A little long, a little downtime here and there and unfortunately also a little lucky. Drawing random tiles from a bag is a bad mechanic for exploration and to get double alien ancients while another player kickstarts his space imperium with only great draws aka free planets just feels sad, not fun. Other than that, it's a solid euro game with the 4X-theme slapped on it. 
The rivals: Exodus Proxima Centauri has an already explored map, Xia:LOADS has more trading as well as more freedom and TI3 has roles, faction decks, action cards etc...all in all, I'd rather play Terra Mystica though ;) Even if it's not space, it's comparable and features less luck and more skill.

Most of the praise that this game has received it very well-deserved. It's gorgeously produced, amazingly quick and intuitive to learn in spite of its complexity, and playthroughs are full of drama and narrative potential. A few minor quibbles: the character art is puzzlingly terrible, and resource-management is perhaps just a little too tight, thanks to the unpredictable nature of the "explore" action.  Slightly larger, philosophical quibble: although I enjoyed playing quite a bit, this was one of the very rare games where I found it hard to see what the point of using a tabletop was, given how much richer the experience could have been on a PC.

The best 4x game out there.  The game features a simple economic system, simple exploration mechanics, technology developments, discoveries, and customization of military ships.  The overall game is complex and time consuming to learn, but quite intuitive.  Once you start playing and have played once, it is easy to understand.  

There is simple diplomacy and some backstabbing in the basic game.  The myriad of races you can choose from are a lot of fun to play and can fit a players style.

The game is longish for newer players, but easily plays in about 35-40 min per player.  The game scales well.  Only 2 player is not that interesting but even then, it can still be fun if you have militaristic players.

A lot of people proclaim this the Twilight Imperium killer and while it is a fun game I still miss those Laws and the diplomacy that TI offers. I think I would rather spend 10 hours on TI than 3 hours on Eclipse, but only just barely.

I'm a little disappointed with how Eclipse is panning out. It suffers from the "No last turn consequences" syndrome where things can be relatively quiet after a certain point in the game and then suddenly get crazy in the last turn because there will be no reprisals in the following turn.

Eclipse really scratches my itch for a light 4X game. The mechanics and bookkeeping are pleasantly simple while still allowing the player ample options each turn.

The ship customization is an excellent way to control the variance in die rolling for combat, and also adds great flavor to the theme of different alien species.

All in all this is a great game to play, with my only complaint revolving around discrepancies in tile value (as tiles are placed randomly).

My first introduction to the 4X genre, and is very fun.  Played first at my first Con on the Con.  Was really impressed, then after seeing other games thought since the combat was dice-rolling it wasn't really all that great and there were better games (like Hegemony, newer and therefore more expensive).

Since Cody got it, though, found the dice rolling to make fights interesting, since without you can just use math to determine what will happen, and often fights wouldn't happen anyways, but with dice you can still get some "eh, fuck it, let's see what happens moments."  And dice, despite meaning some people will have to just sit back and rest while other people do combat, DO make for suspense.

30 min/player play, and part of the 4X genre: eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, eXterminate.  Despite being heavily strategic and looking foreboding, found I can explain the basic play pretty easily, and then the rest comes along as you play, so beginners can take to it without a lot of trouble.

The problem is we've had 3 fights now with Cody, 2 with me and the last with Henry, and we've decided that it's just unhealthy for him to play. I've bought it from Cody to play with others and replaced the GameTrays gift I got him for it with a Tiny Epic Galaxies that will hopefully go a lot better for us.

At some point, though, it just became so foreboding to get this large box off the shelf, with the table space needed and mental steeling and such. Did get to play once more with Abigail, Hannah, Caitlin, and LeeAnne on the family cottage vacation, without conflict (and very little dice rolling conflict even), so that was nice.

Sold on the marketplace here with everything else for $115, that covered some shipping, including the Game Trays I had gotten Cody and Broken Token resource trays I'd gotten for myself, so not too much a loss for the single game I played owning it.

Rating after 3 plays. Need to play a couple of times closer together so I have a better idea of what I want to do in the game, and to work out how much I like it as some of my initial optimism has been slightly undermined. The exploration seems the most fun part of the game, but there is a great deal of luck involved here and twice I've been on the receiving of that and struggled to get myself back into contention all game without success. The battles too can be a little underwhelming... I did not see anything in the way of fighting until the last turn or two, when a host of dice were rolled in what were slightly disappointing climaxes for a game of this length. I think ultimately Eclipse might fall between two stools - it wants a euro-style economy management mechanic and diverse tech trees to mull over on the one hand, and in stark contrast a wild ameritrash dice-fest for the ship battles. A bit of luck in combat is easier to justify than the luck in the exploration tile draw, IMHO, because when exploration goes badly for you the result is a slow death that you can see coming almost from the beginning of the game. Update: the 3rd game with 5 players was more enjoyable with a close (1vp separating 3 players!) finish. It did take a very long time though for what is ultimately not that deep a game, and there was significant downtime (up to 10 minutes per round) towards the end.

The sheer number of bits included in the game is impressive, but even more impressive is that fact that all those bits manage to have a use, and despite that, the game is fairly straightforward to play.

One thing I love about Eclipse is that way that new technologies come into play: while you can reasonably expect to see all of the rare technologies in a game, depending on when they come out can have a big impact on the strategies that players adopt, and this in turn means that each play is fresh and interesting.

The play time is good for a game that feels so epic, although it's still long (purely in terms of the time it takes to play - it doesn't feel long). This means it probably won't get as many plays as some other games we have, but it's the sort of game I'd play every time there's an opportunity to.

Very nice theme, comparable in complexity to the likes of Agricola, Caylus and others. I enjoyed building an empire from the ground up, from exploring and researching to building ships for the eventual battle. However, what felt really off with the game was the fight resolution with dice. Very poor. Definitely need to check Exile Sun's system.

One of my favorite games. There may be more elegant 4X games out there, but this one's my first love, and I'm committed. Deep and immersive, but straightforward enough to be played by experienced players in a reasonable amount of time. Its modular nature allows you to customize each game for the tastes of the players involved, or even set the difficulty based on the quantity of Ancient hex tiles you include.

Euro pretending to be something good. Takes the general ideas from 4X and TI3 and adds bad parts to the mix. Random VP, Random exploration, No actual democracy, random tech. 

The parts I do like - Customizing your ship. 

The parts I do not like - most of it. 

The parts I hate - Missiles.

RATING: 4
[Played once]

Despite some attempts to hybridize the genre ("4X") with euro-management, the result is a game whose outcome feels dictated by luck (randomness permeates all areas of the game: war, techs, exploration... VPs too!) and not extempt from the usual flaws of the genre (like "metagmaing diplomacy", turtling, runaway leader).
Unsatisfactory given the time needed to learn and play.

RATING: 10
The best 4X game. The rules are quite intuitive and the game is relatively easy to teach. First turns are fast as players mostly eXplore new sectors to gain better resource (money/science/material) production. Researching, building and upgrading space ships, destroying NPC Aliens to gain bonuses or more points. A player can win through combat and conquer or by expanding his empire and acquiring Monoliths or by researching. Usually it is a combination of many factors. The game has 7 different races which play differently.

Our games tend to take 45 mins per player. The game tends to slow down towards the end as more and more agonizing decisions have to be made. This is the game that we can talk for hours after the game what went wrong, who should've done what and what to try in the next game.

Works well without the expansion and the promos, but all of them are highly suggested if you enjoy the base game and intend to play it more than 10 times.

The mechanics and game production make what could be a very complicated game very easy and intuitive to understand. The mechanics of placing the population cubes and the influence discs make upkeep easy to understand. The various symbols and mechanics make it easy to see what is going on at a moment's notice. There is a good amount of depth here but it is all very simple and easy to take in. It's just amazing what they've done here. Setup does kind of drag the game down a bit

RATING: 9
I was apprehensive about buying Eclipse. There was so much hype it was difficult to discern the truth in either the excitement or criticism. However, after multiple plays with varying numbers of players I can confidently say Eclipse is the best space 4X on the market (Twi Imp lacks true eXploration and lasts too long for what it's worth). And with the ship blueprint rules, Eclipse is the board game that best captures the feel of Master of Orion. The only thing Eclipse lacks is a thematic end game. The game ends due to number of rounds and victory is determined by a point tally. Eclipse also doesn't offer divergent paths to victory (like victory by conquest, politics, or technology). All of your accomplishments just sort of aggregate into points. But those are minor disappointments in an otherwise amazing design. Let me address some of the criticisms: Are there dice in combat that, even with all the technology available to control probability, sometimes have unanticipated results? Yes. Are missiles extremely powerful in combat without the right technology to counter them? Yes. Can your initial attempts at exploration result in resource stagnant hexes that make you envy your wealthy neighbors and force you to adapt your strategy? Yes. Can the random discovery of ancient technology lead to temporarily unbeatable ship designs that other players must slowly build up to the point of defeating? Yes. Are those "shortcomings"? I don't think so. These are the kind of disparities expected in a 4X game. And most of the criticism seems to be generated by people not expecting those aspects of the 4X experience. In short, Eclipse is a game that has lived up to the hype.

RATING: 8
a very well designed game, with a little bit too much randomness to be perfect.

Gameplay:
+ very solid and clever, but still highly intuitive mechanics
+ a lot of possible actions and decisions
+ a lot of exploration
+ extremely cool resource mechanic
+ EXTREMELY cool ship-upgrade mechanics
+ intuitive combat, which is strongly decided by how well your ships are upgraded

- a lot of the mechanics used in this game are determined by randomness: 
 * system tiles (determine planets, enemy encounters, victory points and discovery tiles) 
 * research tiles (determine what research upgrades are available each round)
 * reputation tiles (determine how many victory points you gain for combat)
 * discovery tiles (give you random boons. can be extremely advantageous, if you are lucky enough to draw the good ones in the 1st or 2nd round)
 * and of course the dice (determine combat outcome)
- if you are unlucky with all the randomness that is happening, it can very much ruin your game experience. while all others around the table can do multiple things, you may only be able to do 1 or 2 actions per round due to lack of income. this is simply not fun to play


Components:
+ high quality components
+ a TON of stuff in the box
+ the game comes with baggies

- the plastic ships are ok, but definitely not as cool as those of Twilight Imperium or Forbidden Stars for instance

Marvelous game, an excellent lightweight distillation of everything that makes space empire games interesting.  Technology, exploration, combat, relics... it's all there.  A production and cost model that is stunning in its elegance. Nice graphics and a lot of variability in the choice of races.   Essentially, the distillation of the original Master of Orion in a superb boardgame, and one that is playable in a fraction of the time of most of its competitors.

Played once (with everybody as Terrans). The game seems well thought out, with a lot of seemingly balanced options for the players. But it's long, and in fact there isn't all that much happening. Luck plays a big part (the luck in which tiles you discover probably has a bigger effect than dice-rolling luck). Tech development is overwhelming in the first game, but probably lots of fun to explore once you know the game better. Different strategies are possible, and that is also something to explore further.
Has plenty of elements that I like, although it's not entirely my cup of tea. Good game, willing to play again.

*The* space 4x game if you don't have 12 hours spare to play Twilight Imperium.

Epic space exploration.  A pain to learn, but very satisfying and enjoyable once you've been trained up.  Most painless way to learn is to play through the IOS tutorial before attempting the cardboard version.  Box says it takes 30 minutes per player, but it's more like 60-90 minutes per player.  Will probably never play it with more than two players.

Highly enjoyable. Decent blend of theme, player interaction, brain-burning, strategy, and management just before becoming "epic" size game. It's like TI:3-lite with some improvements minus the politics. Being able to design your own ships is incredibly satisfying and makes combat very interesting. The resource management system (almost exactly like Through the Ages) works great for Hex-based empire expansion and felt "real". The more you push your empire per turn, the more costly and it can become to other areas of your empire. The "reaction" actions after passing is a nice touch removes any sour tastes from being ambushed by opponents who wait till your done activating to attack you. Overall, this game is top-shelf. Nothing about it felt clunky, it moves at a perfect pace, it's not possible to fully "Euro-game" the final rounds, you're going to have to take some chances against an opponent with randomness.

I love the clean resource tracking and design elements of Eclipse. But the best part is when the board reaches critical mass and all hell breaks loose as combat is the final and best option for expansion and victory points. Your points for building up technology won't do you a bit of good if you get wiped from the board!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Space exploration games with a combat element always run a big risk of being unbalanced, and the designers of Eclipse upped the ante by including rules for changing the capabilities of your fleet, an enticing idea that has crashed and burned horribly in countless predecessors, be they boardgames or computer games.

But right from the start, I felt in good hands, because it was clear that this game has the heck developed out of it. Actions, colonization and sector control are admirably handled as a seamless package, and although the combat system looks a bit clunky at first (the ancient chestnut of d6 hits on a 6), the ship upgrades soon introduce interesting rock-paper-scissors dynamics between the various fleets.

Together with a non-epic playing time, there is quite a bit of glitter in the initial impression this game made, and I’m looking forward to more plays and finding out whether there is solid gold behind the glitter.

Wow, I did not have any expectations about this game, so I wasn't really let down, but I thought it was terrible.  There was way too much luck for my taste.

Luck sources: explored tiles, discovery rewards on new tiles, available technologies, dice in combat.

In particular, I did not like the dramatic swings of power that could happen with a single discovery tile or tech that has only appeared once so far in the game.

Playing a 2 player game taught me two important things.  
1. how to play the game.
2. that I don't want to play the game again.

I realize that having more players would create additional dynamics due to the player interactions, but those would not replace or mitigate the randomness from my perspective, so why bother.  I also realize that this is a popular type of game and I do not begrudge those who enjoy it, but I am here to reassure any dissenters that you are not alone.

A fun space civilization-building game. The worker placement mechanism and the feel that you cannot do everything you want makes this game remind me of Agricola, in a way.

It is lengthy (about 4.5 hours with 5 players) and, if you make a bad move early in the game, you will almost surely be quasi-eliminated from it, as you will be locked inside a poor system with few resources and no chance to fight back. You will lose for sure.

This means spending at least 2.5 hours doing just a couple of actions per round (as you will be short of resources) and hoping to survive.

It is not so much fun to play in this condition. All you can do is try to undermine the game of the player who was responsible for caging you. He will eventually reduce you to dust for it, and that's it. 

Not to mention luck, which has to be seriously taken into consideration: it can decide who will have the upper hand in the early game and, if the chance is grabbed by the lucky player, they will put a good advantage up and march to victory for the rest of the game.

Despite these drawbacks, this is a rich-flavoured game in which there are a lot of paths to victory and, therefore, a lot of strategy going on. The theme is also very good.

Update: the rate have risen a bit after I noticed that the semi-elimination can be mitigated when playing with 4 or less players, as people won't be as aggressive.

Update: played with 3 and 4 players, and indeed it was not as aggressive: with 3 players, got overwhelmed by Planta. The fewer the players are, the stronger Planta and Draco get.

The 4-players' game was much more balanced and fun: Eclipse is best with 4.

Update: the Rise of the Ancients makes the game MUCH better. Upgraded it to a 9 after playing a 4-player game with it.

The reason that I give it a 6 is that this game's speed and atmosphere depends very much on the mood of players. The first 2 plays took about 4,5h, but we got to play once with 2,5h in a 3 player-game. When players take too long to decide on their turn, the game becomes really boring, as any other game, in fact. Can't give it a 10, no, no. 10-game is that kind of game that even if the players are playing in very different ways, you can still enjoy your game, your turn, your round, your strategy...  (2012)

After learning the game, it gets more and more interesting. There is so much that can be done!  and it's really interesting to analyse strategies with other players (after the game is over). Must be played with similar kind of gamers, though. (2014)

Easy 8 after a 2 players game.  I can already tell that it will be even better with more players meaning a more crowded galaxy.   Can't wait to try with 4+ players.

Played a 4 players game yesterday and even if we made a few mistakes, the game was more enjoyable that 2P since there were a lot more interactions.

Now played 2 three players games and this was very exciting.  Balance was good and we got the chance to try many different strategies.  I lost on both, but learned a lot.  Rating is going up!

RATING: 4
Initial rating is an 8 after 2 plays (down to 7 after 4 more).  Good game, not great.  Way too few races for extended replayability.  Nice system, well organized and executed, not terribly original in any single way - the meshing of mechanics is very good and different.  But, the game is heavy on luck, plays are 'same-y', and the play feel is far from 'epic' as some claim.

The game reminds me of others like Through the Ages, Nexus Ops, and TI3.  All good games.  This game seems to be a good game - but no, it isn't THE game, just another good game that will get lots of play time.   So, don't believe the hype and don't waste your money for an over-priced copy, wait until the reprint.

First comment before playing - the typeface for headings in the rulebook was poorly chosen.  I find it distracting and harder to read.  Sure it is nifty, who cares?  Rulebooks should not add artificial things for aesthetic purposes only that then hinder clarity.  The rulebook lacks an index.  So, again, far from a perfect rulebook, but still decent.

The flimsy giant sized cards are a minor issue also - the cubes slide around since the boards do not lie perfectly flat.

I would say the art is weak, the pieces average to weak.  If the game were average it would not have anything going for it at all.  Thankfully, it is an okay game.

One last note - for our 4P games, eclipse takes 2 hours, TI3 takes 3 hours.  TI3 is far more interesting.  At this point I doubt I will ever play Eclipse again - for our 4P group TI3 plays in a comparable amount of time.

I was really excited to play this game after looking at "let's play"s and reading reviews, but I was concerned that my girlfriend (we play mostly 2p; wtb friends that game?) would find it too slow or complex.  I was dead wrong; she loves it.  This is not the slow epic space-drama that some of the reviews and videos might suggest.  There is plenty of complexity and variability to make it replayable and unpredictable, but it never feels slow.  My previously non-gamer girlfriend will be talking about our last Eclipse game (base game only for now) for several days after playing.  

Even when you lose, it doesn't feel like you were robbed, or subjected to undue abuse by the RNG-gods; you just ponder the journey (laaaaaame), and where you went wrong.

This is a brilliant game, even for 2p.  It's extremely accessible for casual 2p gamers (contrast: my gf refused to play even a 2nd game of Twilight Struggle), but not the least bit oversimplified for the foam-core-building, miniature-painting meeple of the world.  Strongly recommended.

The research and ship design elemnts are really a lot of fun and the most creative that I have seen up to today. The game is a very confrontational game, most of it is combatting your neighbors, though it supports more Euro game styles. 
The greatest weaknesses are how you take actions: After somebody attacks you, you can still build a fleet in the same system, you can still research a strong weapon, upgrade your ships so that they counter our enemy and then go into battle. Your opponent of course can do the same. 
I think this game is a bit overrated (though some components are really fun!), and it cannot replace something like Twilight Imperium in any way.

Everything about this game is random, random setup, random explore tiles, random sciences, and random combat. Random, random, random.  I am not a fan of random elements in games usually, but I love Eclipse.

Eclipse manages to control the each of the random elements. In combat, you are rolling to hit, but you can influence what you need to roll, and how many dice you are rolling. With the science tree, you are pulling many of them each turn, so it is unlikely that NOTHING good will be available. In exploring, the tiles differ by where you are exploring. While they added random elements to everything, you can't blame losing on them.

At Eclipse's heart, there is also a beautiful economic engine which you are manipulating in order to boost your production and economy. It is one of the few games that I would recommend to both Ameritrash and euro players.

5 / 5 - Outstanding.

A bit over-complex. A bit over-analytical. But when your reward for all the hard work is, instead of pleasing the provost, to fit your dreadnoughts with ion cannons and phase shields and blow the hell out of everyone on the board then it's all worthwhile.

Twilight Imperium (lacking the political aspects) in 1/4 the time.

This game is extremely elegant.  Things you would have to calculate in other games are handled automatically by the design of the game parts.

The rules are well written but long.  With a person to explain them- you can start in 30 minutes.  On your own, perhaps 45-60 minutes.  But no major ambiguities or rules holes found after two plays with different people.

The theme is the game is the theme even tho it is 90% a euro.  The war game / dice aspects may come up a few times in 3 hours.

Luck is a factor and bad luck can surround you with ancient warships or empty sectors.  

This was a very satisfying game to play.

It will run 3 hours-- about 30 minutes per player.  If you get an AP'er, it will be longer of course.  6 new players and 1 Ap'er ran 5 hours to read the rules, play for the first time.

RATING: 9.9
Best game of 2011 and one of my favorite heavy games.
Fixes many problems of Twilight Imperium, some of the fun parts are gone in the process but it's easily worth it because Eclipse can actually be played by an adult, you only need a free evening (2-5 hours,depending on player count) and not whole day.. Components are good quality and replayability is great, especially with expansion.

2-Player Comment:
* Follow the race suggestions of rulebook. Rise of the Ancients is highly recommended for 2p for more (and more varied) Ancients to battle. Eclipse is decent 2p game, great with 3-4, best with 5-6 and 7-9 is occasionally fun (but long!). I'd rank it 5-6>7-9>3-4>2. Setup is the worst part, it's almost as long as 2-3p game.

Expansions:
+Eclipse: Nebula promo
+Eclipse: Rise of the Ancients
+Eclipse: Shadow of The Rift
+Eclipse: Ship Pack One

The quality of the game is as great as its demand for the space on the table. We had enough problems to squeeze in on the extended table in 4 player game. I can't imagine its version for 9 players :-) Probably snoocker table might be OK. The game is very challanging. However I am afraid that  due to long setup and playing time I won't have many occasions in the future to return to it.

A very popular game with my group. We haven't figured it out yet (in that nobody plays any particular race very well, or in an optimal style) and we're still in the groupthink that missiles are overpowered (because we can't figure out how to beat them). Oh, and we haven't figured out how to handle "bad" tile draws early in the game, managing the resource imbalance that it can lead to. We like the euro-style play and we like the tech tree (we like [thing=177][/thing]); we're not hugely into confrontation in our games, but the combat element in this game works pretty well for us.

A rejouer avec peut être une variante sur l'exploration pour limiter les dimensions max du plateau. 
Développement excellent mais un peu trop long, on croise les autres joueurs lors du dernier tiers seulement. L'interaction s'étant auparavant résumée à passer avant pour bénéficier de l'ordre du tour et pouvoir acheter une techno avant les autres. Parties qui peinent à décoller. 
Le jeu se termine avec un gros combat pour le centre. Batailles parfois trop longues à cause de vaisseaux incapables de toucher.

After waiting for quite some time for this title, I can say unreservedly that it did not disappoint.

Great design and ruleset that offers deep play and rules simple enough that I can teach this to non-gamers fairly easily.  

Update:  Score dropped a bit.  My opinion of the game is largely the same, but the setup time and game length have reduced my enthusiasm to play just a bit.  

This has become one of those games I would really look forward to playing two or three times a year, but probably not more than that.

Played my first game (3-6-17), and I love almost everything about it. The stacks of tiles are pretty darn fiddly, and there's some randomness, but I still really enjoyed myself. Looking forward to many many more plays.

Update: "Some randomness" was a bit of an understatement...

Update 2: .... The only way to stop runaway luck is to actively attack others early on. I am really not that sort of player at all. I still really love various aspects of the game, but I've had some very bad experiences....

Final Update: I really really like this game. I can forgive the random parts, because this game is just too much fun.

Its an approachable 4x, because its been distilled down to an almost pure euro with awesome mini's and a tech tree.

Its worth the effort, because you will be engaged for the entire time you play this awesome game.

It is true, this game is great!

When you play eclipse, you really have to think through your actions, because, everything you do will affect your oponent attitude. In the game you are playing against real human not some clunky mechanics. If you are he leader in the game, then there are thing others can do. 

They can team up against you, and send their fleets in your homeworld. However, there are a lot things to manage, and player elimination is really unliklly (at least not until the final rounds. 

This game is about negotiation and geopolitics. It is really elegant combination of war/economy/area control/euro combination. However, it also create story as ameitrash games.

My negative things about the game are the issue of game lenght, which can be also 5-6 hours (45 min per player). However, there is almost no down time and time just fly by when you play. But better consider to play this with (3-4 players, because 6 could be to long)

Other issue is size of the game, you need to have enormous table, for it. The game take some table space.

And it might be a bit complex for new boardgamers, and teaching takes about 30-40 minutes. But when it is done, the game is really elegant and intuitive.

It is an excelent game, and even if you won't like some of the mechanics, you will remember how this game made you feel. The game doesn't end with final turn, but stay live in your conversation several hours after the game.

RATING: 7
Biggest downside is that it's a long game, so if a player gets screwed by an early attack, they might as well go watch tv for a couple of hours, because the only other thing they can possibly do is play kingmaker.

The sheer number of small rules make it easy to accidentally make an illegal move, which then cannot easily be undone because it's already affected other players.

Other than that and the length of time between turns, I can't find a fault. The complexity is at least orderly, and it's got fun systems.

I'm a sucker for Space game and civ games.

Mechanically, this is perfect. Very streamline and elegant. Unfortunately does not have the epic feeling as my other favorite games. The games ends too abruptly, without a feeling of anything being accomplished, and we simply score victory points.

To make things worse, every time I play the game, it ends up taking the same amount my group takes to play TI3. If this game could realistically be played in 90 minutes to 2hours (like Galactic Emperor), I would definitively rate it 9.

This is a very solid game, well designed which I would liken very much to Terra Mystica except with teeth aaaaaand dice rolling :-/

So basically no matter how cool your fleet is unlucky rolls will spoil you and a crappy fleet can roll lucky and wipe you out

In my first game my opponent literally found 3 ancient weapon tiles in a row placing making is nearly dreadnaughts invincible. The fact by carful reactive tactics I was able to wipe one out was very cool, but still RANDOM and ANNOUYING and CIV game that TAKES 2-3hrs for a 2 player game

RATING: 7
Whilst this is a decent enough, relatively fast-playing 4X game, I do have some issues:

The things I really like about the game are as follows:

1) clarity - the rulebook is excellent, and the mechanisms are all designed to show the information you need in the situations where they are relevant. The system of wealth versus earnings is very simple, but brilliantly executed. More games could learn from this;
2) for a 4X game, it's really quick;
3) there are tough decisions every turn;
4) the traitor mechanism: the last player to break a treaty loses 2VPs;
5) modifying your ships is cool. I can have tachyon drives on my cruisers;
6) the flow of play during the action rounds is quick.

The things I don't like are:

1) what the hell are you doing for the first five turns? All that happens is you explore and try to build your tech to a level where you can compete with the Ancients or with other players when you meet them. It's fine, but it drags a bit;
2) because of this for a 4X game, combat doesn't tend to happen until later. If you fight early, you've used actions you could have used to research, so you'll be sorry later;
3) the traitor mechanism - the last player to break a treaty can't form another until an opponent breaks a treaty and takes the card. Whilst I can kind of understand the reasoning, this is pure artifice;
4) hey, wait a minute - I've discovered Tachyon Drives. I've can put them in my fighters and my cruisers, but I have to WAIT to take another action before I put them in my big ships...? Unless I have nanotech, of course;
5) the system of discounts for tech has no relevance to the type of tech being researched - for example, computer types do not all fall within the same tech-type, therefore there is no benefit to researching a Positron Computer (+2 attack) then a Gluon Computer (+3 attack). This is counter-thematic, if not plain idiotic;
6) combat is slooooooooowwww;
7) the turn order mechanism is rubbish.

Exploration: it could be argued that real-world empires don't all start on an even footing; nevertheless, games are a construct. A little imbalance is fine with me, but I can see how one player's situation might be greatly disadvantageous. This is slightly mitigated by the fact that you have a some choice where you place - or whether you place your tile at all. It's an OK solution, but I think I'd prefer an open galaxy with a Settlers-type mechanism of placement to mitigate advantage. I'm not saying specifically a Settlers mechanism - just something that allows a bit more starting balance.

Technology: I agree that, given that actions are limited by cost, there is no reason to artificially limit the tech types by chit draw as no race will ever be able to research them all. This is another artifice because it feels like, rather than a directed research spend, these future 'advanced' civilisations are basically discovering new technologies by lottery. One solution, given that there is already a discount system in place, might be asymmetric technology costs for the different races to encourage diversification. In fact, this is a good idea. I claim this idea for a future 4X game that I'm now going to design (and Dave and others at the club can tell me what I'm doing well and what I"m doing badly).

Combat: I don't so much mind the initiative idea, but the combat just takes so long - and I think that the system of I-fight-you-first-then-you-then-you-then-the-ancients means that someone who has a huge fleet can be beaten by someone relatively weak because they've had their fleet mashed by all the previous combat. It should be simultaneous. As far as the mandatory combat for entering someone else's territory, even that of an ally - this has been a known mechanism since the first Sid Meier Civ. I didn't like it then and I don't like it now, but I think it's perfectly reasonable given it's now a convention, otherwise there might be very little combat in the game.

Reputation: this is a bit artificial too, but it's better than the chit-draw system that scores at the end of Louis XIV. At least you get to draw a number of tiles and keep one. This mitigates the randomness a little, and I quite like the fact that some of the scoring is hidden just to add that little frisson of tension. Of course, it could be argued that this is a way of ramping up tension which should be inherent in the playing of the game.

RATING: 9
Fascinating empire builder, with so much going on, yet so easy to handle. Nice, organic economic engine balanced just right, and kept simple. On the second half of the first game there was hardly any need for the rulebook anymore, because of the effort put into usability. Plenty of routes to victory even with playing just the human factions, but other selectable races introduces yet some more significant variety. Great game, all around.

The only thing I'm not entirely in peace with is the constricted, nine turn limit, which I can totally understand from the game design point of view, yet almost every game ends abruptly and sometimes unnaturally. Someone finally launched his mighty Armada ready to crush everything, nobody can stand in its... oh, sorry, times up; the dude with the three monoliths won. Again, I understand the reason behind it, but can get a bit weird thematically. Wouldn't change it though, you should adapt to it, it makes the game better.

Muy bueno. Infinitamente más vistoso y trabajado que Space Empines 4x, aunque la parte de exploración se queda muy sosa y la de combate queda limitada prácticamente a la última ronda. Mención especial para los tableros individuales y el sistema de gestión/contabilización de recursos.

RATING: 5
4X-themed space empire-building board game with hexagonal tile placement sub-mechanics. As is the current trend, the game combines some euro mechanics with a lot of ameritrash theme and dice rolling. The most innovative feature is the empire expenditure mechanics where the same tokens used to select actions are used to claim space regions, and every subsequent token used entails greater costs in the turn upkeep reckoning. This means that every action taken is much more expensive for expansive empires. 

The problems with the game: It relies too heavily on chance, and an unlucky start situation might make it very difficult if not nigh on impossible to catch up; or alternatively, fortunate players could easily win because of being lucky. Battles are dicefests of the kind more usually seen in Games Workshop products. Runaway leader could be a significant problem. It is to geared toward conflict with few other realistic avenues to victory. And as all games of the genre, slooow: our three-player game took some 200 minutes. 

Recommended to fans of 4X games and for Twilight Imperium players that wants a similar though perhaps less involved game with more luck that plays less slowly.

I'm  a big fan of Twilight Imperium but it requires a heavy investment of time.

Heavy, long, lot's of stuff, but FUN.  Customizing your own space ships and building an economy/ exploring are all beautifully designed. Combat seems inevitable, so I wish there was a viable victory option without combat, but the combat is fun as well. Great game, won't get to the table often though.

This game requires a time commitment of around three hours for a full compliment of players. You really need the right group of players for Eclipse to shine, if your group gets bent out of shape when you over take a juicy tile they control, then avoid this game. It will be a miserable experience. However with the right group this game is easily a solid 9 rating. As it is though, I feel strongly that this game is highly over rated, that's not to say it's a bad game, it's unique and ground breaking in many ways. I just don't feel it in my bones, as I do other great games.

Very clever design. The mechanics of the economy work well and do a good job at modeling the growth of expenses as an empires grows. The various resources work together quite well, and each has a unique place and purpose. The ship building and techs were great fun to play with. Rating might be an 8, but for a few factors. Luck of the tile draw being one. But also luck of the ship techs. And for a game with this many ships, there doesn't seem to be enough combat. In both games we've played, combat has only occurred in the final round (other than the pushover NPC ships). So now that I'm over the uniqueness of the game system, I have to ask how fun it is to play. Right now, it's a 6.5, maybe a 7, but it could go up as I learn it more.

After a second play I can praise the game for its design but find myself not enjoying the combat aspect. The randomness in exploration can also be quite punishing or a convenient windfall. I do enjoy researching technologies and customizing my ships.

Overall I'm done with this genre. The game is largely reactive (what planets did I discover? What technologies are available right now?) and so much of what occurs is lucky and swingy. While there are choices, the are rarely strategic and never fun.

Very high agency in terms of game play, the fact that what you do effects the outcome so dramatically is what makes this a gem. It sort of combines euro-style economic mechanics, with customized ship building, and Amerigame style ship battles + modular player powers. The way the battle mechanics works isn't so random that you often see a very powerful ship defeated by a weak one, so game outcomes have less to do with luck than one would anticipate.

This is the game I thought I was getting when I first purchased Twilight Imperium 3. Eclipse is everything TI3 is not: faster moving, higher conflict, and FUN. This game is pretty deep with the ability to pursue different paths to victory. TI3 moves at a glacial pace, bogged down by all the minutia, and it forces you to always take the Imperial card whenever it comes up which slows you down even more.

The only reason I am not giving this a 10 is because the ships are way too big (particularly the dreadnaughts). The only area where TI3 wins is in the plastic capital ships. But that is pretty minor in the grand scheme of things.

If you want the best space empire game that covers the 4Xs without making you feel like taking a nap between turns, skip TI3 and get Eclipse.

I get the appeal. The game has it's problems for me though. The VP tiles for winning battles are ridiculous. In a game where 1-2 VPs can make all the differecne and knowing who should be attcaked to prevent them from winning is vital, why is there such a high amount of hidden VP information? This game could be great, but it needs some adjustments to make it a truly competivie game IMO

I read every single review before taking the plunge and it lives up to the hype.  The anti-hype is what was hyped.  I particularly enjoyed the mechanics for resource management, tech tree development, ship development, exploration, and combat; yes, that's basically the whole game.  As for luck, I feel it's comparable to the opening plantation draw in PR, only moreso, or the initial hand in Agricola: the challenge is to make the best of what you get.  

UPDATE: Yep, 10.  Pretty much my favorite game at the moment.

Changed from 7.8 to 5.15, on 12/27/17.

I initially thought that this intricate science fiction multi-layered monstrosity was great. 

Then I played it a few times, and learned that I actually hate it quite a bit. It crawls on forever; the build-up is ponderous and seems to often develop in ways beyond just chance, to unfair positions.

I have played my last few rounds of it, with the express intention of not allowing lengthy development. My final game ever, I focused solely on bombing the population of enemy planets to destroy their production, leaving my own unguarded. More fun, but it pissed off most everyone else that I went for the Team Genocide Strategy and ruined their slow-burn buildup!

Never again. Just say no to Eclipse.

A tight, well designed board game of exploration and conquest.  The mechanics are very much more aligned with generating a good economic/point engine than with taking large armies out to destroy your enemies.  Even the way diplomacy and the traitor card works gears the game toward more peaceful play over total war.  That being said it is one of the most elegant game designs I've seen; every piece and bit utilizing multiple functions in intuitive ways.  That alone makes it a joy to play, with the strong support of a good theme and high production value.

Haven't played consistently enough yet to rate, largely because the space requirement and fiddliness of the setup is a barrier to most folks I do things with.  I like the gameplay quite alot, particularly the shipbuilding. However, for a game of this heft there seems to be relatively little space for an internal narrative to form, compared to, say, Game of Thrones.  That may be because I've yet to play this without at least a couple of newbies, so the rules and turns still tend to sag.

I think it's best I just copy/paste some comments about my most recent play:

6 players, each race with its own benefits/drawbacks, each player with 4 types of ships, each with its own unique stats all on top of the randomness of the way the techs come out, and each player having their own techs...it all became too much information to try to keep track of, particularly in a game I'm not enamored with. I made an alliance early on with my neighbor who had the race (red) that starts out with a lot of money. He ended up with a booming economy and had his ships decked out to be essentially unstoppable. In his late-game rampage he looked over at my board and said "you're not a threat" and moved on. I suspect he didn't know my racial "+1 VP per colony" power. Combined with my racial "explore twice instead of once" ability means I should grab as much territory as possible and hold onto it. Which is what I did. That's fine, that meant I just needed to focus on my own stuff. I was ready to be done at about the 90 minute mark, and the game ran a little over 3 hours. Red was the military powerhouse, and while he was out warmongering White came and stole a couple of his colonies in the last round. This cost Red 5 points and allowed me to win by 2. I didn't care.

This game is just too long, too much to track with a theme I'm indifferent to. I understand the appeal, but it's not my thing. The randomness of the dice, the exploration tiles, the available techs and the bonus tiles on top of all the stuff to track makes me feel like the outcome isn't really in my hands and I sort of tune out. For example, in my early game explore actions (where you draw and place a tile to reveal new areas) I got all areas with resources as opposed to alien ships, and the bonus tiles I got early on were two +8 money tiles. This allowed me to take more actions, and the resources meant I had more stuff coming in. The blue player, in the meantime, kept drawing tiles with alien forces he'd have to fight before claiming the resources. I think the game has a bit of a snowball effect going on, a runaway leader issue. The way the tiles come out can elevate one player and hammer another. Some players will have a problem with this, some will not. I'm the former.

Again, I can really see the appeal of Eclipse, but it's just not for me. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This game does the scifi epic right. The resource system works like a charm and the way large empires become very expensive to maintain. I like it, and I'm definitely not a fan of the genre. Perhaps a bit of "I admire this game more than I enjoy it", but still, fun game to play.

Indifferent.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is a phenomenal design. I think it's a better game that TI3 but I don't necessarily think it's an either/or thing - there's room for both games in one's collection, especially since the diplomatic and trade aspect in Eclipse is nearly non-existent. That said, there's tons more player interaction here than in TI3, which is, without the expansion, primarily a game of saber rattling. I look forward to future plays.
---------------------------------------
Ratings downgrade after another recent play.
This feels more and more like a cube-pusher and less and less like a sci-fi 4X game. And the fact that I can be the most combat dominant player on the board and completely hammer my opponents in fights and draw 15 tokens out of the bag which all happen to be 1's is just stupid. Makes the entire experience a waste.

The only thing that keeps this from being a perfect game is that after 15 or 20 plays you really start to feel like you're playing the same way each time.  But, I still prefer it to TI or most any other empire builder space game on the market today.

Lots of fun and easy to pick up. Mostly self-manages so it's easy for non-gamers to track everything. I'm a fan of the sci-fi theme but it doesn't get in the way if you're not.  I wish this was card-based instead of dice though.

Can't decide whether I enjoy this or not. Some of the mechanics are neat. I enjoy the tech advances and the exploring, but there is something that bugs me; I certainly remember being quite angry at some stage during a 6 hour session, I got over it without fuss, but I can't remember now what the issue was.

Hannah does not like this.

**Update**
I will never play again. Never has a game of such length left me so isolated, unable to interact with my friends, and uncompetitive through misfortune. I've played this 4 or 5 times now, winning several times, but in each play a growing sense of unease grew into a monster that nearly ruined my mood through this last 5 hours of waiting for the end.

I will just add my voice to the chorus of those who say that this is a great game.  I think it's a perfect "next generation" American-style game.  Plenty of dice and plastic bits, lots of direct conflict, exploration, and fiddly-ness and modifiers - but with Euro ideas thrown in that make the game take less time, streamline choices, minimize downtime, and eliminate the possibility of complete elimination.  Those who shy away from old-school "Ameritrash" should give this a try as it avoids most of the problems that kind of game tends to have.

Eclipse is basically your usual resource management engine builder, which is fine for an hour or so, but this has exploration and combat added to align with the space 4x theme. While these aspects make the game different from, say, Goa, they're also the most annoying--i.e., random--parts of the game, with lots of dice chucking and random tile draws. Unlike other epic conquest games like Struggle of Empires, which also has all sorts of upgrade options along with random elements to combat and movement, there's no central mechanism that makes this game different (like alliances). It's just develop, move, fight, develop, move, fight, etc. I like a good space theme as much as the next guy (The ships are sweet!), and I suppose there's some nice variety in trying out the different races. But overall I haven't gotten enough of a wow factor out of this game to feel like it belongs in my collection.

A masterpiece. Clever mechanisms interact beautifully to provide plenty of consequential, thematic decisions with a minimum of downtime and fiddliness. People have quested for years to produce "TwiLite" -- Touko Tahkokallio has scored a bull's-eye. The components are well-done and the rules clearly written and organized.

Being a fan of Euro-games, this seems like a game I should like, but I don't much care for it.  I absolutely hate the "explore" part of the game.  "You explore and get 2 resource-rich planets; You explore and get a new technology; I explore & get nothing."  The lack of balance in the explore action ruins the game for me.

Deep enough to satisfy my gaming buddies, yet simple enough that my 10 year old son could pick it up. The various races and sectional map ensure every game plays out differently. While the game plays best with four or more, the expansion  and addition of Ancient home worlds creates much tighter three player games.

Eclipse is enjoyable (though I don't think it's ranking on BGG is deserved).  It has some problems, though, like early tile draw dictating the game and some technologies (notably missiles) leading to unstoppable fleets.

RATING: 5
Too much euro cube pusher to me. In a game about space conquest, this is a huge drawback. Also, I don't see the point for a wonderful ship customization in all details, if the ship battles happen between a couple of models each - I'm ok with the chance, but then you have to distribute it between dozen of ships then. 
Like in other *cough [i]Space Empires 4X[/i] cough* games, that are way much worth it imho.

Broken game. Every little part of it is super interesting, but the combined efforts of all those mechanisms sum up to one bland and crappy experience full of game-breaking bits. Players can lock themselves out of the game area. Players can abuse technologies to basically nullify dice rolling in combat. Sadly the expansions do not address any of the problems and just pile more of them on.

Very good space explore/empire game with some novel concepts and mechanics.  I still like TI3 for its theme (which is done better IMHO); but this is growing on me.

RATING: 6
One of the coolest and most epic games that you can play with 9 players (including expansion here) within a relatively short time (approx 4.5 hours).  The biggest downside, particularly with experienced players who know the tech, are missiles.  Specifically, missiles combo'd with gluon computers.  Sure, you could build up somewhat of a defense against this.  Interceptors, of which there is one tech like this.  Perhaps shields, though even these, with enough dice/computers on the other end, aren't gonna help you.  But really, you need to spend the entire game building up this defense - getting the size of your army large enough to take the initial blast, moving large fleets into strategic locations so there aren't any small battles and, during the large battles, you have some survivors.  All of these take turns and aren't as high a rate of return as the gluon computer/missile combo. 

So, get missiles.  

I still have a blast playing these large games, but always, always, always, I am left unfilled at end of game once the final large battles are fought and the missiles reign supreme.

A Mage Knighthoz hasonlóan - mely szintén BGG top10-es volt megvásárlásakor, akárcsak ez - sokat töprengtem, hogy megvegyem-e. A szabálykönyv első ránézésre nehezen megérthető játékot sugallt, pedig egyáltalán nem az. Agricola után a munkáslehelyezős rész nem volt újdonság, a többi szabály is szép és logikus, a csaták levezetése kis odafigyelés igényel, de az is egyszerű.
Szerintem ügyesen keveri a kocakdobásokat az euro típusba - csaták kocka vezéreltek -, ha mersz, kockáztatsz, ha nem, akkor kiépíthetsz jobb esélyeket is, de ez időbe fog kerülni. A kétszemélyes játékkal sem volt semmi gondom, jól jön hozzá a kiegészítő extra lapkáin lévő ősi fészkek. 
Remek játék!

Summs an epic scale space game into couple of hours of playing time. I'd much rather play this than some other heavy space games out there. 

Many mechanics are excellently designed and the game plays very differently depending on your play group. 

So, amazing game but due to it's length it's not going to be played in every game night. Still best space game around.

RATING: 7.5
I have two 6-player games under my belt.  This game is the real deal.  Lots going on and lots of ways to pursue victory points depending on how the map and wormholes line up.

I think I prefer the conflict aspect of 4x, and while Eclipse's endgame is directed that way, it consists of euro-style engine building for much of the game.

Furthermore, with 6 players, it's 4+ hours.  This limits the kind of game nights you can play it.  It also eats up the whole evening and there...are...so...many...good...games.

I like it, but I'm not sure if I'm someone who wants to commit that amount of time to just one game.

Way cleaner than anyone was expecting, I think, which makes all of the quirky characteristics [very high luck factor] stand out. 

There is room for strategy, but there is quite literally luck involved in every decision in the game [with predictable probabilities].

It is truly a fantastic game, though, and has had the shit playtested out of it with at least a subconscious eye toward expected values.

Nothing is out-of-place and even the seemingly-broken missiles are fine. The tempo, pacing, and climax of the game are exactly right.

My first "real board game." This will always be in my collection. It has almost everything I love form TI3 and then some. Ship customization is a ton of fun and the ancients floating around add lots of variability and consequence while exploring. An excellent archetype of 4X.

RATING: 7
A nice space exploration game.  I like that you research ship technology and improve your ships over time.  I also like that there are enough options that you and your opposition wind up focusing on completely different strategies.  Then usually there's an epic battle as people fight for the centre and ultimately see who's strategy prevails.

RATING: 7.8
UPDATE: Still generic, and I'm not crazy about the ship models, but it's a well-oiled machine.

Extremely streamlined and intuitive. Lots of options and exploring is fun. Very hard to see how people won't enjoy this.

However, there is room for more chrome and color from an expansion or two. The Eclipse universe feels extremely generic (we only played Terrans) and I would like the universe to be fleshed out a bit.

iOS and analog versions. 

This is a great game of 4X. The combination of special empire abilities, exploration and building an empire come together really well. The combat is simplistic but fits well in the game. I'd give Eclipse a 10 but deduct points for:
-0.5 for setup, breakdown, playing space requirements and artwork. There is a lot of components in the game and the playing footprint requires a big table. Players really need to stand up to see whats going on sometimes and access the common tech track. The artwork is a bit drab and the use of pink and brown for resources adds to this.
-1 for downtime, which tends to limit the game to no more than 4 players. I haven't played 6 players analog but would imagine it would be much worse.
-0.5 for teaching and learning the rules. Although the rules are relatively simple and intuitive it is a lot for new players to take in and new players will get pasted by experienced players.
-0.5 for risk of player elimination. A player can bankrupt themselves accidentally and there is significant risk of being exterminated from map reducing their game to just going through the motions until game end.

The iOS version eliminates the setup, table space requirements and has much better artwork so I give that version a 9.5.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
This could be the definitive space exploration/battle game. The production is high quality and the boards laid out very logically. The game builds steadily towards the climatic finale. Even if your fleet is destroyed by a bit of over confident attacking, you still retain the VPs from those battles. With only 9 game rounds, Eclipse does not make for an overlong game and you are left wanting more!
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

Interesting game and some good mechanisms. However there is to much luck in the game. Especially in the beginning if you are unlucky to discover bad Galaxy’s around your home Galaxy. Then you are far behind and will most likely spend the next to hours fighting to survive. 

Another issue for me is the need for power in the spaceships. I like the develop mechanics, however the need for power is a key for errors. It can ruin a game when you discover that an upgrade made to rounds ago was not legal because the ship did not have enough power. It´s easy to see how many upgrades you can make, but you can make mistakes when calculating the balance of power in each ship.

I've only played it with 2 or 3 players, but I love this game. My one big complaint is the luck with tile draws can really screw you over, and I guess counting up the score at the end can feel a bit arbitrary and like an anticlimax. Other than that though the game is a real experience, with so many interesting, meaningful choices over what to do, a real sense of progression, great production quality, tense player interaction. It's just generally a lot of fun!

My friend's favorite game. This game's most unique feature is the ability for you to upgrade your ships. In most games you can buy upgrades but upgrading ships in Eclipse works by first unlocking the upgrade via research. Second building the upgrade and placing it on the your ship's layouts, then building the ships. You upgrade the layout of a ship, and then it will effect that ship type every time you build them. 

In addition to ship building you have exploration, fighting NPCs, and unique abilities per your starting race.

Played another 5 player game.  Although I like the ideas behind the game.  I stand behind my previous statement.  I don't care how skillful you are and how you've outfitted your ships or maneuvered them.  If you can't get the correct dice rolls you are screwed.  Game takes 1 hour per person PERIOD!  Which means I would never want to play with more than 4.  Too LONG, requires too much table space, and bad luck can screw you over.  Can't rate this higher than an 8/10.

This is a very good game!  I like the Euro-style economy that you have to build, and how slick the mechanism to track the progress of that economy is.  However, I'm not sure if the skill/luck ratio is quite right for a heavier game of this length.  My opinion may change with more plays.  Due to the heavy time investment, I'm not sure how often that will be.  Our 1st play took 6 hours with 6 newbies, and the 2nd took 4 hours with 4 who played once before and 1 newbie (add to this 1 hour for setup and rules explanation).  I can see this game eventually taking less than 3 hours with 4 people, but only if everyone is fresh with the rules and technologies available.  And this just won't happen in our group, because we never play the same game more than 3 times in any given year period.  As a side note, it also requires a LARGE table to play.  

Got a chance to play my first game last night with 6 players. I got both bad tile draws and was connected to a militarily heavy neighbor. Finally got exterminated completely in the last round of the game, because I could never grow my economic engine due to bad tile draws (couldn't get rid of my cubes to expose higher income levels) and was constantly fending off my neighbor military giant. I would have had a chance if other neighbors came and took some pot shots at the military giant, but everyone just kept to themselves. Afraid to instigate the wrath of the military giant. In the end the military giant won the game with a score of 41, and second place was 32. So I had a total blast getting hammered for 5 out of 6 hours that the game took. I should have just thrown in the towl half way through the game and saved 3 hours of my life. Unfortunately, I won a major defensive fight against the military giant giving him a black eye and bruising his ego. All it would have taken is 1 other neighbor to attack him at this point to give me some breathing room. But everyone else was keeping to themselves building up their empire. It didn't do them any good in the end.

Second game went much better, but I did make a mistake in the end game with which technology I upgraded on my ships(plasma missiles intead of plasma cannon), and forgot about the 'ship pinning' rule.

My go-to big sci-fi game. I get this is actually an economy engine driven game, but I also love the exploration, the ship building/upgrades and the rough and tumble combat. Dice chucking galore. It's a big free for all, and so far the game does not reward aggression in any way, especially early on. You might do one or two key battles in round 9 to take points away from others, but if you attack early everyone will dog pile you. Just be warned.

Después de mi primer contacto con Eclipse le iba a endosar un Rejected con todas las de la ley porque la partida entró en mi Top 3 de las peores experiencias lúdicas que he tenido junto con Twilight Struggle y Circus Maximus pero no me podía creer que el juego fuese tan malo y aburrido con todas esas alabanzas y hype. Así que me armé de valor y le dí otra oportunidad. El juego me ha parecido aún peor pero por lo menos no me dieron ganas de cortarme las venas como con la primera partida así que le quito el Rejected y se queda con malo a secas por aburrido, aleatorio y descompensado.  El juego consta de 9 turnos en los que en los 3-4 primeros solo sacas losetas y la colocas en el tablero. Y lo peor es que marcarán lo que puedes hacer durante el resto del juego ya que te darán unos u otros recursos, azar puro y del malo. Durante los siguientes 3-4 turnos coges avances tecnológicos y los aplicas a tus naves mientras te enfrentas a un par de naves neutrales. Los avances están hiperdescompensados y no salen todos y de algunos no  habrá para todos así que vuelve a salir el azar a relucir. En los turnos 8 y/o 9 te das con los otros jugadores en unos combates que o están descompensados y te crujen de un plumazo o es una tirada tras otra hasta el hastío de lo largas que son y carentes de emoción. Y siempre igual, partida tras partida. Si el juego durase 45-60 minutos vale pero ¿3-4 horas para esto?. Va a ser que no.

¿Hablamos de la edición?

Los "tableros", he visto hojas con mayor gramaje.
No sabía que se podían hacer naves espaciales feas. Reto superado.
¿Hablamos de la edición española?, ¿si me compro un juego en inglés e imprimo las reglas tengo una edición en español?. Pues eso.
¿En serio este juego cuesta lo mismo que La Guerra del Anillo?

oh boy what a great game. It seems you can't talk about Eclipse without bringing up TI3, so here goes :-) Over the years we only ever got to play TI3 like 3 or 4 times due to the length (games ranging from 6 to 9+ hours). I'm not saying Eclipse is TI3 but shorter, but it goes a very long way to scratch that itch (case in point, 9 plays in just 7 months). Plus this game also is great as a 2 player game. It could have done with  bit more flavor text stuff left and right, but the mechanics are absolutely brilliant, and combat is usually pretty frequent and cool.

Perfect space 4x game for our group at the moment.

I didn't see that coming. I was "scared" to play this game, no matter how great were the comments about it. I'm not the greatest fan of Space Theme, nor the war inclusive Civ games, but this one go straight to my no1 game of all time, from the first play. Amazing feeling of enjoyment, win or lose the game, since it gives you a sense of fullfilment at the end, that you got somewhere, you have explored, invested, produced and upgraded your fleet the way you like. And all this in around 2hours of play (not for the first play though). AMAZING

This game is so close to being great. I love the exploration, I love how streamlined the tech tree and resource management are, and there are enough hexes in this game to give it some real variety.

Absolutely my favorite game in my little collection.Great space sim game.It's not "epic" as Twilight Imperium but it is close.I think it has all the elements to become an "all time classic".Great mechanics,great components,many paths to victory and of course the coolest aspect of all.You can make your ships as you want them.If you want them heavy armored,go ahead and do it.You want them with supreme weapon arsenal,go on.You must plan your next step with caution,every round.But be carefull your recources or your empire will collapse.And the different alien spieces with their own different abillities are adding to it's replayability.The random factor of the hexes and technologies that you draw doesn't bother me,because the game clicks in all cylinders for me.Awesome game!!

A fantastic game, one of my favorites. I love the customization of ships by putting parts on the blueprints of the player sheet.

My only complaint is that it has a lot of luck especially with the tile draws at the beginning of the game. If you draw bad tiles early on it can really hurt your chances of winning.

Great depth of strategy and multiple ways to win.  May take a game or two to get the basics of the mechanics straight, but once you do, the rules are easy to remember (the iconography on the player aids explains everything in case you can't remember).  Only knock is how long it takes to set up

When I fist played Eclipse, I had this weird experience of playing a game that I SHOULD have loved, but I didn't. I gave it a second chance and I also felt something weird about the gameplay.

Then, and finally, I gave it a third chance... with a totally different group and... VOILA! That was it. The second group I played the game with, was more engaging and drove the game towards more direct interaction from the third turn till the ninth. The game was ultra fun this time, and I realized that this is not a game for everyone... and certainly not for every group.

For me, this game is a blast, but I don't understand why so many people is in love with it.

This game has it all for me. I enjoy it a lot.

I got hosed by a supernova, but still managed to get 2nd place.

It's a good game, balanced, with all the elements of a space 4X game that I like. Short and to the point.

Thing that doesn't make this a 10:
Random point draw of shields worth points.
Kamakazi ships to get shields.
Feels like the game just started when it ends.
A little more luck dependant than I like.
Lacks flavor.

These are all small points, but add up to subtracting 2 points

Getting used to the game. Still an 8 and a good game, but not going higher than this.

In this space exploration and conquest game, players can explore, build up their space ships, move and attack, research to optimize their civilation and gain influence on planets. 

This is a game that has a steep learning curve, but very enjoyable. There are so many different paths to victory. There is luck in the tiles you get to explore, and the dice you roll in combat. There are a ton of options, and that's what makes this game fun. Rating likely to rise with more plays.

RATING: 9
Provisional rating after one, 4p game. I was left rather underwhelmed and found it all quite boring.

My turn, explore. Place some cubes. My turn, explore, place some cubes.  I didn't develop any ships or any tech. Everyone made alliances, so there was no real need to. Until the last turn when I was bored and decided just to build and attack to see what it was like (underwhelming). Obviously I didn't win, and maybe it was just one of those games - I got them impression the other guys found it dull to (they had played before and enjoyed it).

I will give it another go however.

Update - played a "normal" game and it was far better. Starting to see what all the fuss is about. Keen to play again...

Update - yeah, ok. I got it wrong. Sorry. This game really is very good!

I love the depth and meaty decisions offered in this 4X economic game. Its a little on the long and complex side so I have trouble getting it to the table but it always delivers when I get it played. The alien races are different enough to be interesting but not so unique as to make it impossible to win on a race you haven't tried before. Only real criticism is the player elimination that can occur (often not full elimination but removal from contention and interesting decisions which may be worse). This often occurs because players that lose key military battles often become easy pickings for everyone else.

Intimidated at first, I actually took out all the pieces and thought I wouldn't be able to figure out of how to play it.  Glad I tried, was easy enough to self teach with the rule book, did miss a few things the first play through but was enjoyable. Very intuitive. This is now my go to board game if I have a few hours to kill, the wife enjoys it as well!

Need a few more plays to see if this warrants all of the hype.  I am unconvinced that this is the Twilight Imperium killer.  WEAK diplomacy mechanism.  I think the hype on this one will cool over time. There are folks on the geek that are already calling this one repetitive after several plays.  

Current rating: 7.5

Second Play: Really enjoyed it, went a bit long with 6 players (6 hours!) but we were still noobs to the rules. I wish comparisons to Twilight Imperium would end, these are totally different games.  TI scratches a completely different itch for me.  I'm bumping my rating up to an 8, but that is probably where it will stay.

This is probably not the most fair review as I only played half the game the other day. The resource management with the ship system is interesting. I do feel like its probably more streamlined than other Civ board games (haven't played any though) but I'm not sure. The space theme doesn't get me - if it were themed different and not sci-fi, I'd bump it at least 1 or 0.5 points. With a full playthrough/multiple points, I'd bump it another 0.5 points I expect. The price of the game would bump it down half a point or so though.

Plays: half of 1

RATING: 2
It is technically a very good game, but it also can be very luck dependant (e.g. 4 points for fights vs 16 points in a game where you achieve ~40 points total).

After a round of eclipse i do not feel like i had an amazing time - but i felt like i played a well designed game.

Update 2016: Reduced down to 2. Way too long. Won't play it ever again.

Great lite 4x game, with heavy euro elements. While it has a few too many random elements, a vast majority of the time, it feels like the winner is the person who played the game the best that session. The mechanics all feel great and the way the economy and actions are tied to gather is perfect, it really feels like you are trying to manage and maintain an interplanetary empire.  
  
Great for those who like euros and who have an interest in the 4x genre, but find the likes of Twilight Imperium to lengthy and/or mechanically clunky.

Frankly, I am a little dissapointed in this game as it didn't live up to the hype for me. Don't get me wrong, the game is extrememly well designed and balanced. I was just a little dissapointed that the game centers around conflict as much as it does (not my type of game). I think this rating would increase if any expansions in the future added non-combat oriented technologies and other methods of obtaining points. Still a fun game though!

Very good game! After first reading of the rules, I was a little afraid the game could be too dry. It's not the case. Mecanisms are good implemented in the theme and we have well the impression to manage our galactic empire. The beginning is not easy to manage, we are very limited. We must be patient to have some ressources or take some risks at certain moments. Impatient to play it more.

Eclipse features a staggering set of interlocking and yet elegant and streamlined mechanics encompassing exploration, economics, tech trees, diplomacy, unit construction and warfare logistics – but it's also a mite on the random side and the largely automated yet time-consuming combat is a crippling issue.

Beautiful game. An epic space game played in a bit more than two hours: so much happens in that short time.

The game is conceived to be extremely playable, keeping the bookkeeping at the minimum, offering the best experience with the minimum effort.

The only (but significant) thing that I don't like is that eventually battles count AND battles are resolved by dice rolls, in a not completely satisfying way.

A good game in any case.

I personally like Twilight Imperium... but it is SOOO heavy that my group won't commit to playing it. Eclipse, however, is a perfect compromise for them. It is a bit fiddly (which I don't mind at all) and somewhat random (with exploration tiles and technology tiles). We still don't play it a lot, because it is still on the heavy side of a medium-weight game.

Very good game. Everything seems to be streamlined exactly the right amount and really well thought-out to the end, including the graphic design which is working great in aiding you through the game. However, there is still a huge amount of luck in the game (exploring, technologies, combat), so it is not something for the pure perfect information strategy folks, and the turn order system is plain bad. Also, the game has a potential endgame problem.

Played only one 2 player game and I cant wait for more games with more players. Finally a Euro game with a strong theme. Yes, there is luck but its a question of probability and trying to minimize the effect of luck. Many winning strategies, lots of emotions and interaction. Highly recommended!

Edit: Played a 4 player game and I LOVE THIS GAME!! Many winning strategies, lots of theme and amazing fun!! I didnt even care who would win! Cant wait to play again!

Edit2: Played with the alien species and I think I like the human characters more. The game is highly based on trying to adapt to conditions that the game gives each player, so when the alien species already through their character have a strategic direction it is harder to adapt to change the strategy and adapt to the conditions.

Interesting game and I like the choices it presents.  It's an incredibly tactical affair, with the biggest point swing happening in the 3rd Act (and specifically the final turn) and an insanely bad luck of the draw/dice can make the experience a 2-hour build-up to sadness.

That said, I enjoy Eclipse.  It's not the Second Coming of TI3, but it's not trying to be.  It's closer to Master of Orion than epic space opera.  Enjoy it for what it is.  And don't play Draco.

The economic engine of the game is sheer elegance. Especially in the representation of increasing strains on a large empire, it is reminiscent of Through the Ages. But the combat is too swingy and takes too long. I greatly enjoy rolling a handful of dice once to simulate combat, but the exercise grows tedious if repeated many times per engagement. It is also unfortunate that certain tiles of the same level are strictly better than others, as this amps up the already excessive luck factor.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.75
It's fun, but way too dependant on exploration tile draws for whether or not you can succeed.  For a game that takes as long as this does, it's unacceptable that you can be permanently hamstrung in this way.  Its still a lot of fun while you are playing.

One of those games that seems amazing if you don't know any better. It has many problems that are more frustrating after many plays: The dozens of little cubes are easy to bump and ruin the entire game. It's easy to accidentally cheat while managing your own board. Player elimination can happen early and really sucks. The game is really, really long. Needs at least four to play well. Other than that, it's a great game of epic space combat. An individual game can easily be a perfect 10. But an early elimination can lead to a runaway victory and a disappointing experience for everyone.

RATING: 8.5
A very clean civilization-and-war game. My introductory games at 3p (all Terrans) were not quite as fun as a huge 6p free-for-all with one alien each.

The more I play it, the more I appreciate some truly genius design elements. For example, the reputation tiles system encourages (a) fighting; (b) fighting early; and (c) not fighting too much, all with a simple set of rules.

Another example: the economic system allows you to have a large or small empire without overly penalising one or the other. A large empire can give lots of income, but is also costly to maintain, and it all balances out.

While the hex map can be a little bland (I appreciate actual maps), the ability to create chokepoints with wormholes is another great design element and adds lots of replayability.

I'm in the camp that thinks Plasma Missiles are overpowered. Yes you can counter them, but nothing else requires a specialised counter - you can beat everything else just by doing your own thing better. If the PM player is not countered then his fleet is simply invincible.

Good, fast exploration game. Everything feels streamlined in this game, but not simple. You can get a good idea if you can win a combat, so unless you're going in on an even footing, you can generally depend on win if you overwhelm your opponent. There is some randomness with what you get dealt for exploring, but you can mostly modify your ships to deal with it.

The game was quite different that I expected, but I liked it very much. Simple rules, streamlined, deep, and the mechanics work together quite nicely. I can't say the game is fast (it was a 5 players game), but it didn't feel long either.

Still, there is the possibility of gangbanging a single player and sending him to hell with no chance for him that scares me.

Also, the distribution of the tiles can be very unfair and lead to real dis/advantages ingame.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
First impression (5 players): Always a sign of a good game that rules are rather simple - for this type of game - but they offer plenty to play around with. Eclipse feels to be a mix of euro-ameritrash gameplay, rules are pretty euro being rather "clean" but the gameplay with all chaos, randomness and gameplay narrative (or perhaps the table talk it encourages) feels more like traditional american design. There is plenty of randomness in the game as battles (dice), exploration and tech "tree" (tile draw) but it feels there is just a healthy amount of it. Sure, some games you most definitely will lose due to a bad luck and in tight games you can always blame luck but it also enables some of the most epic comebacks that I feel are part of this type of games.

I like how player board design makes it easy to keep track of production, upkeep and discounts. Although it feels a bit too fiddly to keep all those pieces there. If I would have to name one specific part from this game I really love it would be how you can customize your ships in Master of Orion -style without making it too much of a hassle. It sounds like a gimmick but it works very well and adds one more layer to (a threath of) battles.

Overall the game feels very good and not least because it seems to be playable in 2,5-3,5 hours with experience with right people (with my regular group it seems to take 4-5 hours no matter what) but still offers a feeling of a galactic civ game with all the necessary pieces in there.

RATING: 3
Too much randomness.  When exploring, you draw random hexes; early on, they can be manned by hostile aliens you can't defeat, making you waste precious actions.  Have that happen a few times and you fall behind.  The combats are still, despite all the modifiers you can tack on, driven by dice.  The weird scoring mechanism for combats makes it seem like a lot of space battles, especially at the end of the game, are best negotiated in advance!  But worst of all, the true deal-breaker -- the random victory point chits (value 1 to 4) you pull out of a bag post-combat.  The winner of a game this long should NEVER be swung by tiles drawn randomly from a bag.  Unacceptable.  Will never play again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Sure, there's a game in here. But, like too many other games, it has several fundamental flaws. The dice-combat is interminably dull, the random layout of tiles could shut out a player with more than 4 at the table, and there is the potential for some quite awful kingmaker problems. The plastic bits are unexciting, and the backstory risible.

It's passable entertainment, but I don't really understand why I'd give up several hours of my day for it.

RATING: 9.5
Salo had some Eclipse comments that were so spot on, all I can do is copy them, and add my comments:
[q]* Tech Tree: random tech draws give variability between games. It's fairly open what you can develop, but if you have researched a tech in a particular field already, it's cheaper to develop new ones in the same field. The result is a simple yet elegant tech tree that nudges you in certain directions but is not too restrictive; highly efficient.[/q]
You can gain efficiency in building up with primitive techs first and getting to advanced techs later, but you don't have to do that. If you do get advanced techs first, you can't use the full discount on the smaller ones. Pretty ingenious. The randomness of the tech tree creates quite a bit of variability in the game, apart from the explore  and discovery tile draws. It also makes turn order fairly important since you might want to pass first in the hopes a good tech comes out.

[q]* The Resource System: using Through the Ages's idea of removing cubes on your player board as you expand your empire without that earlier game's fiddlyness; a wonderful design solution to the problem of bookkeeping.[/q]
I've worried over the fiddliness of [thing=25613][/thing] for quite some time, and I cannot develop a more efficient system of tracking economic impacts. Increasing population has several impacts in TtA: consumption, happiness, and new population costs. Similarly, expanding your population in Eclipse impacts your economy, science, and materials. It may be fiddly to setup, but it completely streamlines the remainder of the game. No need to count planets or anything.

[q]* Building your Ships: my favourite part; you can upgrade your own ships so that each player's ships are individual and each player can develop their own military doctrine, so to say. This is all done in a way with ship blueprints and tiles that removes any form of bookkeeping.[/q]
This is the cool part of the game, and there is a lot of room for strategy about what to get, when to get it, and how to best attack whoever. that's it's tied into the economy, tech tree, and victory point system makes it even better.

[q]* Action System: a brilliant method of action selection, whereby taking actions and expanding use the same resource (action disks--which like the other resources you remove from your board, exposing the increasing upkeep costs as you use more disks), thereby balancing how much you can do and how much you can expand. [/q]
Another neat innovation. I can't think of another game that does it quite like this. The larger your empire, the more your actions cost you. A smaller empire can actually afford to take as many or more actions simply because they have fewer influence discs managing their sprawling empire. This forces some nice choices about # of actions and  rate of expansion. However, this is somewhat mitigated by the bankruptcy mechanism, which I am not sure I care for. I take that back. I am [i]sure [/i]I don't care for it. Bankruptcy should have a harsher penalty, IMO, such as losing permanently losing an influence disc, or something more drastic. You should be able to use it as a way to get influence discs back on your board.

[q]* Incentive to Fight Early On: the method of awarding VPs for combat (which you draw from a bag and choose the best) give you an incentive to attack early on, as the chances are that at the end of the game only the low value chits will be left.[/q]
Related to the reputation VP scoring, this neatly solves the turtling issue that most 4x/economic games suffer from.

[q]* Expansion: the explore action is cleverly handled so that you quickly expand, bringing you into conflict with your neighbours very soon. There is no long build up before you get your empire onto a war footing.[/q]
Also, the wormhole system allows you to try and manipulate avenues into your territory.

[q]All in all, a wonderfully designed game that is a lot of fun to play; you will end up thinking the game a lot after playing it.[/q]
Agreed!

This game was a smash hit with my gaming group. Best reception of any game so far... One of my friends went crazy with the exploring option. Someone else and I had a technology "arms race" that culminated in an epic final battle in the center on the last turn. Another raved afterward about his ability to customize his ships. I played with five guys who had never played the game before. It was a very long first game last night, and we loved it.

Eclipse is a good game, although it could take a very long time with more than four players. It also requires that everyone is very organised and rather careful not to scatter the components: do NOT play with someone who is careless when rolling dice. Also, you need a very big table.

Positives:
Eclipse captures the theme beautifully.
· The economic mechanisms are intuitive, and present interesting challenges.
· Once players "get" the game, play is quick with little downtime.
· The breadth of options encourage experimental play.

Negatives:
· It is intimidating to some newcomers, and a challenge to teach.
· Poor luck in early turns can probably be overcome, but might easily be discouraging.
· The sheer amount of space required to play. No pun intended.

We will need to see how fast players become with greater familiarity. At present I am a little worried that Eclipse may take too long, or be too heavy, for frequent play. Much like Dominant Species or Antiquity.

My friends really like this game, but I'm still struggling to enjoy it.  The mechanics are sound for a Euro but as a 4x game, there are some aspects that I don't quite understand.  I do enjoy the combat system, including the pinning mechanic and the die rolling reminds me of a more mature Risk.  I just wish there was more emphasis on battling and less on the economic side.

A lot of fun. A solid 4X game with a great theme and pretty good balance between the different player options. 

It takes a while to play, which is the only reason we don't play this more often, I think. We've gone out of our way to schedule "Eclipse days" once or twice just to make sure we get a chance to play this. On the bigger board gaming days, this often doesn't hit the table as it would take a good chunk of time.

Good Game. Great game even. It's like the best of times when playing a short Master of Orion II game.

All in all, a very well done, very enjoyable game.

Cela fait un moment déjà que l'on m'en a parlé de ce jeu, et qu'en bien :-). Voici donc Eclipse un jeu de type 4X Sur fond de thématique SF. Le moins que l'on puisse dire c'est que le pari est réussi. Esthétiquement, je le trouve beau pour commencer. Après au niveau des règles, il a fallu tout de même pas loin de 45min pour qu'un expert en fasse le tour sans trop rentrer dans les détails de la pratique sachant également que son auditoire est habitué de ce type de jeu. Eclipse est donc selon moi à ne pas mettre entre toutes les mains : de par sa richesse et sa complexité, je doute fortement qu'il intéresse réellement des joueurs autres que des passionnés de jeux et de SF également.
De ce que j'ai pu voir les races me semblent équilibrées (à part une en particulier) et c'est un réel plaisir de faire ses actions au travers du mécanisme bien rodé qui nous est proposé dans le jeu.
Les combats m'ont également beaucoup par leur simplicité et leur efficacité : il s'agit de lancer de dés mais ceux-ci sont conditionnés par des équipements sur les vaisseaux. Cela rend la partie toujours plus attrayante.
Parmi les points qui m'ont moins plu c'est notamment le plateau de jeu des joueurs sur lequel "glissent" trop facilement les pions. C'est un peu facile à dire de dire ça avec 4 ans d'écart entre la sortie de chacun des jeux mais je préfère largement le plateau de jeu de Scythe dans lequel les pions s'emboitent parfaitement sans que ça glisse partout.
Viens ensuite la durée du jeu qui me semble assez aléatoire selon comment va se dérouler la partie mais qui reste relativement assez longue.
Ces parties qui trainent en longueur (même si on ne s'ennuie pas) et le fait que le jeu ne soit pas très accessible font que celui-ci est assez difficile à sortir. Je lui mettrai bien 9 mais pour moi ce point fait la différence pour lui donner la note de 8

I can definitely see why this gets compared to Twilight Imperium.  It does a lot of the same things that Twilight does in a much shorter time frame but I just didn't find it as interesting as TI3.  There just weren't any dramatic moments or talking points like you get with Twilight Imperium.  It seems to have potential though and I'd play it again but I was far from blown away by my first game.

RATING: 8
Very fun.  Not a 9 or 10 because of "game balance" when one or more players draw bad tiles vs. other players drawing good tiles.  When this occurs the game is not fun, since it becomes obvious early in the game the battle will be just between those with good tiles.

Eclipse is an impressive design, but beware! I like randomness, but not when it depletes me of any real chances. The issue may be levelled out with an increasing number of players due to the more negotiations, at least, that is what I hope for.

Actually, these kind of games are just my most beloved. But: I don't trust Eclipse. Somehow, and I can't specifically say why, I sense that from time to time, the game may seriously(!) frustrate me, and that is a feeling that other similar games of the genre don't generate within me. It has "bad vibes", somehow. It's still a long way to the for trade list, and I'm willing to explore the game further, but currently, there are multiple games I'd rather play instead.

[b]Eclipse[/b] was sold via auction 4/20/15.
Received in a math trade (3/17/15).

[i]This was a tough one to judge. I played a 2p game with my son and by the end the whole experience fell flat for us. There was very little tension since we could each explore our own part of the board. Then when there was finally some conflict I demolished a large portion of his fleet making it almost impossible for him to come back. The ancients in the base game are too weak to put up much of a challenge by the mid game. However, early game, my son got hosed because every tile he explored had ancient ones while I was getting tiles where I could place out my cubes unimpeded. 

All that said I loved the game and think it would shine with at least 4 players. I would love to play it again at that player count, but that isn't going to happen in my house so I decided to purge it. [/i]

Despite having an abstract economic engine akin to Through the Ages, the theme and the physicality has made it a hit with my wife. While I think I prefer the way the systems interacting in Vlaada Chvatil's masterpiece, I can certainly appreciate the mechanism repurposed as the basis for a quick-playing 4X game. I have yet to play the asymmetrical alien races, but otherwise I can say that the game is both mechanically robust and engaging; even if ship to ship combat can largely be decided by technological advantage rather than strategic positioning.

My favorite game for the moment. It has the right amount of randomness to it, so there just isn't a "perfect play-style", rather you need to focus both on your game and at the same time paying attention to other players actions and how the tech-tree develops. 

I think I'm many many games away from losing interest.

After 2 played games this "mini" Twilight Imperium seems a great game that makes you want to play it again and again. Despite the fact that the overall strategy remain the same a party to the other, a game can't be the same each time. You have always to react and adapt your choice to be avalaible in the victory race. Smart and relatively simple rules, fluidity of the action phase, incredible fun to make your own ship, this game have all the ingredient to have a good time.

Two plays as of Nov 2011. One 3p and one 6p.

Excellent game - it's astonishing to be able to play a full sweeping 'space opera' type game with six players in 3 and a bit hours.

That said, Eclipse still features most of what makes this kind of game Ameritrash, even though the rules are streamlined and fairly 'Euro-ized'. Dice rolling a-plenty, luck of the draw when exploring - there is certainly a healthy dose of luck in the game so if that kind of thing turns you off then this might not be for you.

If you don't mind the AT style (which I don't), then this is a hell of a game and well worth picking up. Certainly this runs circles around Twilight Tedium, which takes about 2-3 times as long and doesn't do nearly as good a job of encouraging aggressive play instead of turtling and empire-building.

RATING: 7
Nice 4x implementation, coming in safely within the usual evening timespan, with the VP system encouraging non-turtling, but plenty of points on offer through building rather than combat. Meaning there's lots to explore. You've got three currencies to manage, so the first choice (which may be inflicted on you via the luck of the exploration tile revelations) is whether to concentrate on developing your research, build or extra actions capabilities. Basically you want all of them. There's a fair bit of luck in the combat system so getting tech upgrades to alleviate that luck is important if expansion and combat is your strategy. Like most in this genre, falling behind in the tech tree and the arms race is probably a death knell, so even through the game disguises it well, it only takes a turn or two of being knocked around and you're off the pace, so it's as ruthless as any. So you need to be ok with that aspect to truly enjoy it. I'm not sure I'm quite there yet because I'm a turtling pacifist at heart, but I definitely want to explore the game further to fully understand it.

What I like:
- Cool theme, exploration, plastic ships
- Clever mechanics (influence/actions, colonies, etc)
- "Reasonably" short (my first 3p game was under 2.5 hrs)

What I don't like:
- The game is geared around fighting each other
- Definitely more complex than I prefer
- Randomness is pretty high for such a long/heavy game

There is a lot here, so I think the 3.5 weight is justified. 

It reminded me a bit of Tempus, where the world is just small enough that you *must* fight each other, whether you want to or not. But where Tempus had a lot of aspects that I really liked, Eclipse doesn't. Aside from the annoying focus on military, Eclipse isn't bad, but it's not great either, for me.

Good game but it seems to boil down to a fairly turgid battle at the end. Also, I don't like games where people arrange the universe. If you can't move a ship more than a few squares, YOU CAN'T ARRANGE THE UNIVERSE! The technology reminded me of some ideas in a game I was working on... I feel bad giving it a relatively low mark, but it still doesn't come close to hitting the spot that Master of Orion II ever did... Which might be asking a lot of a boardgame. I can't fault the design, I appreciate the way that the economics is 'under the hood', I just don't find myself clamouring to play it. Race for the Galaxy and Twilight Imperium are still the better 4X games for me.

Ok, so after a few games I definitely do not enjoy playing this as a 6-player game. To me 4 is going to be the sweet spot I think. It just takes too long and specially the battle phase turns into a tediously long phase of dice rolling. My original rating for this on the 16th of FEB 2013 was a 9 and I just downrated this to an 8. It's still a great game but definitely not for 6.

After first try:

It takes a lot of space and a lot of time to setup. Mechanics are very good. I like the similarities with Through the Ages use of population. Also like the dual use of action/influence discs.

Tech advancement and exploring is more or less like many other 4x games. I like the non-linear tech advancement system. 

Fighting is less than many other 4x games (at least in our first try) and that's the way I like it. I'd like to see a 3x game (without fighting) with all the rest from this game. 

Played it several times now and still like it. Some races are easier to win with (Planta & Draco) than other especially when the opponents don't know how to hurt them.

We actually managed to crash a four player game after three rounds. One human player went bankrupt and another player was so small he didn't want to continue squeezed in between Planta and Draco, so we ended the game.

Probably a euro-gamers dream. Personally, I think it's a good game, but overly hyped.
No tech tree, fixed number of game rounds, too much emphasis on victory points. Feels like a combination of Through the ages and Agricola in space.

This is a very good game.  I don't really agree with the inevitable comparison to TI3: they're very different games.  Eclipse includes more economic management.  TI3 has more random elements, in particular the Action Cards.  Both are long games.  When I play TI3 it usually goes about as "fast" as Eclipse because the other players know what they're doing.  It's really an "apples and oranges" situation.

All things being equal, I'd play TI3 first.  But rarely are all things equal and Eclipse is a good alternative.

7 Plays - Brilliant game. It's played over nine rounds. During each round you explore, research and build combat ships. Usually during the last 2-4 turns people will be ready to duke it out with their fleet of uniquely equipped ships, with the final combat rounds usually determining the overall winner. Great set of different themed races (6 different alien races, and a human race = 7 total). Quite a lot of different parts to setup and manage though, and you will need a large table to play on. Looks great however, and also a lot fun. It is possible to get smashed the whole game though, which can be a little demoralising if you don't handle that sort of thing well.

Based on one play: I really enjoyed my first play. You build up an army of ship and you upgrade each type of fleet with research. You also explore and sometimes fight (mostly near the end of the game). One frustration is the exploring as you may draw a tile that does not fit and lose a turn and action doing so (turns out we played this rule wrong). Actions cost you money, getting more expensive each time and you need science to perform research and material to build ships. A lot of cool mechanics that work great together with a nice theme. Definitely would play again (this time the advanced version where each race has a different specialty).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is one of my most played games and was one of the first I got into after getting into the hobby a couple of years ago. The theme really clicked for me and the people I mainly game with and we were all used to this style of game from playing video games like Masters of Orion.

It can be a long game, around 45 mins per player in my experience but it is worth the time as it really does a good job of creating a 4x feeling with a heavy slant towards economic management. But you also get to explore, build fleets, research technology and upgrade your ships. The latter being one of my favourite aspects of the game, I really like to see the different kinds of builds I can create as well as the builds that other people come up with, then pitting them against one another or the Ancients.

I'd estimate around 50 plays of this (I haven't logged them all) and I am a little bored of it now; the last few games I've played just haven't excited me like they used to. It is still overall a great game but I have found that the experience can be dulled by players making odd choices like not going after the person who is clearly in the lead and going on a mad revenge binge when someone attacked them, even though the original attack was a reasonable tactic. 

Even taking what I have just said into account. If you've got the right group, enough time and a big table I would thoroughly recommend this.

Eclipse is a great 4X game with a lot of depth.  It is a ton of fun especially for strategy gamers.  The only down sides to the game is that it can take awhile for a game especially if instructing new players.  It can have a steep learning curve, but once it clicks it goes a lot faster and is loads of fun to play.

I really liked this. A 4x space game that had a bit more of an economic aspect to it than Twilight Imperium. What really pushes it up higher for me than TI3, though, is that it is so much shorter. We played in under 4 hours with 5 players, 4 of which had never played before (myself included).

I liked the idea, but the start exploration phase seemed to generate very random boards. If you get only enemy ships around you at the start, it's not going to be an easy game, compared to everyone else. And since the game is long, you're likely to be on that position for a while...
I'll give it another try and see how it goes.

My group loves TI3 but we can never get enough people/enough time to make it worthwhile.  While I totally understand that Eclipse doesn't fulfill all the neat stuff that TI3 can possibly bring to the table it sure does feel fun, interesting and just complex enough.  Add to the fact that after we learned the rules games only take us about 25 minutes per player and we have a winner.  My only complaints are the perceived imbalance of plasma missiles and the insane rush to combat at the end (though these are most likely issues only due to our playstyles, with more plays I'm sure different strategies will emerge).

RATING: 7
The game I really want to compare to Eclipse is Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri (the computer game).  Like SMAC, the game features customizable units that can be upgraded with different features depending on what technologies you've acquired.  The game's resource system reminds me a lot of Through the Ages.  I think the game works well together, and doesn't last too long, but there's a lot of rules overhead and early exploration luck seems to have a large effect on outcomes.  I might rate this higher, but I'm not a huge fan of the genre.

Rather complex, too long & frankly disappointing.  I was playing & kept wondering when the fun would arrive.  That's not to say it is bad, but I just don't get the fuss.  It's got some Euro-style mechanisms underneath & a tech tree, but in the end it is another conflict game with d6 resolution.  Suffers from the multi-player conflict phenomena (i.e. why did you attack me, I'm in last;  or the "stay out of the way of the bullets" to win strategy).  There is also way too much luck for a game this long (e.g. exploration in the first round).

[6/29/13] Initial rating after 2 training games. Awesome, breathtaking mechanics. Can't wait to try again.
[7/2013] Update. Played 6p with all Terran, took 7 hours. I came in 2nd (30 points). 3 new players, 3 returning. Time will come down I think, can't wait to try again. 
[4/13] 10. Awesome, want to play this all the time.
[7/14] Been playing the iOS app extensively the last year with ftf game time very limited these days. Played a ftf 5p on 7/4, my 7th play (6th play was abandoned about half way through). I love how this game has a "bungie-cord" effect, where when you stretch your empire out, the limits on resources force you to make decisions about what you want to keep. Also, combat has a decreasing value over time due to limits on VP chit space and values, allowing different strategies to flourish at different points in the game. Expansion is fantastic, as just a handful of Rare techs cans be used to counter missiles, but not nerf the missile player entirely. Love the neutron-bomb negater.

Initially I rated this game a 9. It was a euro version of Twilight Imperium, right? It felt fun, battles near the end of the game were interesting, ship upgrades and research were a nice touch. So why do I rate it so low now? It feels rather random and combat isn't really that interesting. You roll a handful of d6's and hope to hit on 6's or possibly lower with computers. This can go on for quite a while, while the other players sit and watch. It doesn't have any of the flavor of Twilight Imperium as all the races are slightly different, but not really more interesting.

Rich typically get richer and you can also get rather screwed over by not getting the right tiles when exploring. The game feels too repetitive and by round 6 or 7 I feel like the game should be over with. The rating may increase slightly with 2 players, but for now it stays put.

I'd much rather play TI3. Eclipse with 4 players takes about 2 hours and TI3 with 4 players takes 3-4 hours. I'd play it any day of the week over Eclipse.

Optimal Player Count: 6-9 > 5 > 4 > 2 > 3
Plays well with all player counts but the more, the better. Also, if playing with 5 or more, use the 2 pawns to play simultaneously.

The space game for those who like open information and being able to calculate it all out = not me. Yes, there is dice and variable victory points - but for me variable victory points issue is a luck in a wrong place. I like full chaotic ameritrash, yes please. There are no hidden information like action/battle enhancing cards or any game rule alternating possibilities. Also, there is not that much interaction between players because everybody fiddles on their own play sheet most of the time -  a bit similar to Through the Ages. Player actions are not limited by other players choices = again less interaction. And this means a lot of downtime in a 5 player game. Maybe it´s better with 3 or 4 players but I´m not keen to try it out.

Excellent take on the tech tree, and a lot of interesting decisions. Unfortunately, initial exploration draws can hamstring early plays and downtime can be brutal, but turns are meaty and satisfying, so it's not so bad. Probably not as pointed with less than six players. Looking forward to playing alien races with variable starting positions.

UPDATE: This game should be over in 6 or 7 turns, but it drags out to 9 or 10 (I forget the exact number). Also, people upgrading their ships after you move to attack them is just really lame.

One of the few games I ever thought about giving a 10.  My only knock on it is that I enjoy the completion of a wargame setting more than the Euro experience.  The turn limit at 9 adds strategy towards the end of the game but for me it would be great to just play till only one race was left.  So, not a bad hit on the game as it is rock-bloody-solid but for my tastes I just can't pull the 10 trigger.

Still, awesome!

Space opera/Empire management 4X game or Masters of Orion, the boardgame. 

I think there are several good things happening here. The resource management is clever and streamlined so the game doesn't feel fiddly. Combat is quick and filled with drama, like it should, and very well integrated with the ship design. 

There's enough variability to keep each game unique, the alien races introduce some flavour and they seem fairly balanced. 

Luck is present in reasonable doses but good play usually overcomes bad luck.

Eclipe feels epic, like a good space opera 4X empire management game should feel and yet it still manages to play in a very reasonable amount of time. A 4 player game usually take us two and a half hours. 

I think this may very well be the long sought after Holy Graal of the genre. Great work, formerly unknown finnish designers!

-Epic space civilization game without the epic time commitment.

-The player reference cards were quite useful.  Wish there was another set of the 4 "Overview" cards (scoring, ship part, technology, combat) particularly for sessions with 4+ players.

-Game came with 4 extra green colored Starbases?

-Extra blank chits, the black and white chit bags, and lots of plastic bags was a plus

-Interesting resource management mechanics and multiple ways to victory

-Intial setup and cleanup takes a bit of time.  Easier when you have lots of players helping. 

-High replayability value with optional alien races to choose from

-Wish the manual had an index or table of contents page

-Some components had fallen out of the punch outs.  One space tile came nicked at one corner

-We made a house rule that you are allowed to move ships through an allied player's space instead of attacking.  Both players in the alliance have to agree.

Initially, very good but my opinion changed slightly as I played more.  Definitely a high competition factor.  Can be a bit punishing early game, and not always fairly so.  Very fiddly.  Not liked at all by my son, niece and nephew, so it must lack a certain X factor.

(12/2013) Traded.  Here is why.  This is not the 4x situation that I believe in.  The game design is constrained in certain ways and I feel it is a detriment.  The game ends up being more about what you couldn't do than what you COULD do.  This is a fact of life in economic games but I will thank you not to make my 4x games into economy engines.

4x designs should be open in terms of possibilities, sandboxy, and strategic.  This is closed, economic, and tactical.

Edit 4/23/13:  Rating raised from 4 to 7.  I was wrong, so wrong.  I see the light.  Long story short:  Never play a game for the first time with someone who does not know the rules.  That said, while I like how the game is centered around trying to have the best economy (after now enjoying these types of games having played and loved Le Havre), I wish Eclipse had true diplomacy (voting, rules changes) and more flavor such as missions and hidden objectives.  Trying to explore and conquer in the most economic way possible is a fun brain burner, but I wish there was a little more flavor to the proceedings.  My issues might change the game too much which is fine, but it would be nice to at least have these more flavorful options and make the game close to a 10 (the resource management is oh so very awesome and elegant, the game just needs a little more oomph).  The first expansion doesn't look to fix my qualms, but adds more (now mobile) enemies to fight which does add more flavor in 2 player games which is appealing.

5/21/12: Elegant resource management, but overall boring.  Fun to anticipate new upgrades (if you can even get them from a random tile draw) and build up ships, but just as you build something substantial there's a few boring battles and the game ends.  Something missing here, needs more flavor like missions.  As far a theme and being ranked as #1 thematic game on BBG -- the game is bland and boring.  I wish I had the Kool-aid to drink that everyone else has so I could enjoy this "fun" and "thematic" game -- as it stands now, the game is neither.

A good multiplayer space 4x game.
Works well with large numbers and easy to finish in an evening (less than 3 hours). Combat and interaction is encouraged, although it is possible to be cut off or isolated.
Not as dry as something like Space Empress 4X, which is a game that I like but does not quite engage me.
The tech research availability works well enough in the context of this game where it is more a case of what research can you do for a single confrontation of perhaps a few years than any feeling of guiding your race across the centuries. Think Babylon 5 - you just get the five years of the show, not any of the thousand years of history that got them to the show.

[After 2 - 2er games]Great game. I don't know if it will continue to hold my interest and whether I'll like it with a crowded table, but this shows loads of promise. An expensive game, but so far I would say money well spent.

After a couple 4 player games I continue to enjoy this game and am slowly learning all the ways that I can take myself out of the winner's seat!

This is probably one of the best space-based 4X board games. It's really a economic and resource management game, though. Players do have a good time managing and growing their empires. I'm not sure if all the races are well balanced? Games tend to play out the same, though: empires expand, and don't conflict much until the end of the game when massive space battles ensue

I have all but the black hole mini-expansion and play with almost everything. This is one of my favorites for sure. I really enjoy this game with 4-6 players, and hope to sometime try with 7+. We don't typically play with Supernovas, although I find them interesting. Alliances aren't typically used either, depending on number of players. This is a great 4X game, can be a great intro game into 4X games. So if you are trying to get people interested in TI, try this 4X game first with them to plant the seed. Also, lots of replay value given all the expansions (tech, races, galaxy exploration, etc.).

Played the prototype.

Quite easy to learn for a gamer. You get the feel of the game and it's easy to develop valid strategies even as a first timer. Soon you end up very much drawn to the game. It took us 4 hours to play as many were newbies and we were 6. 

The game involves a low amount of downtime as the players take actions around the table. 

The actions are quick and don't involve furious anal-paralysis.. Most of the time you can choose among a couple of decent actions. The order of the actions you take during your turn doesn't matter cause theyre available to you no matter what actions the other players choose.

It's more of a long-term strategy game, which i like very much. If you get involved in a galactic war you have to think short term too.

My first 4X board game and always my favorite. The game allows anyone to play how they want. Want to explore? You can probably win that way. Research? Probably win that way? Duke it out? Probably win that way (although you won't without research). I wish it had more individual player interactions outside of combat (like trade). Also enjoy how you can go PVE. If you want to play a 4X but not compete with someone--you can just fight the Ancients.

Wow.  Epic 4x in a playable length of time.  I haven't found a mechanism I don't like -- customizeable ships, the way it handles the economy, the techs, diplomacy:  all good.

My only (minor) quibble is the turn order deal; like Railroad Tycoon, you can randomly benefit/be hamred if the person on your right/left passes unexpectedly (depending on if you wanted to go first or last).  Easy fix though -- have two sets of turn order chits available (one for marking your order on the current turn, one for choosing when you go on the next turn), and when you pass you get your choice of the remaining chits.

This was a great simulation of expanding galactic empires and space combat. The research and upgrades allow for a huge variety of ways to make your ships unique from the enemies. It seems daunting at first (hence the Medium Heavy rating) but once you get it, the system flows well. Exploration of unknown sectors means this game can be different every time you play. Combat can feel a little lopsided and luck driven, but requires strategy nonetheless. A great game!

3 hours of micromanagement and losing because of kingmaking does not help me to appreciate the game.
Probably not my kind of game. I find the whole concept rather childish and pointless.

RATING: 4.3
Nekem nem jött be, egyrészt elég hosszú volt a játék (kb. 3,5 óra), másrészt jelentős a szerencsefaktor, holott ez egy komoly stratégiai játék! (kockadobás, milyen hexát húz az ember) Valamint jelentős előny, ha valaki játszott már korábban, ezért nem igazán volt esélyünk egy olyan ellen, aki a héten már játszott egyszer.

update
2014.03.21
Továbbra sem tetszik ez a játék, több okból! Az első, hogy most sikerült 5! óráig elhúznunk úgy, hogy igazából egyikünk sem gondolkodott extra ideig.
A másik, hogy a szerencsefaktor sztem óriási. Kezdődik azzal, hogy nem mindegy, hogy milyen lapokat húz fel valaki felfedezéskor, majd amikor olyat húz fel, hogy Ősök vannak azon a bolygón, nem mindegy, hogy miket dob a kockával. És végül az, hogy csata után húzunk győzelmi pontokat a zsákból. Valaki hiába négyből választhat csak egyet, mert olyan sok ellenséget semmisített meg, ha mind a négy 1 pontos, akkor rosszul jár ahhoz képest, aki "csak" részt vett egy csatában, azaz megverték, ezért húzhat egyet, de az mondjuk 4 pontos.

I enjoy a good resource management game, but it's a rare treat to be able to enjoy it in space with cool space combat. The tiles are beautiful, and I love the way you drop cubes from your board onto the plants, revealing better incomes from the resources the planets produce. Very clever and thematic! I like how the tutorial race (humans) are completely playable against the advanced races on the flip sides of the board. I also like that even though the game uses dice for combat, you can alter your ships with computers and shields to alter the probabilities of sending and receiving hit rolls. The upgrading ship blueprints and grabbing technologies is really fun and satisfying.

Spending actions on bad explore tiles can cause you to fall behind early, which is perhaps unnecessarily random. I'm always tempted to house rule it and say look at 2 and pick one or something of that nature.

There is also a technology called Missiles which allows players to get one first strike ahead of normal combat, but then they don't fire again. When stacked up, they can create warpy battles.

Additionally, with more players the game can become difficult to keep track of who is in the lead in victory points. Most points in the game are public knowledge, but many aren't easily visible by other players, particularly if you sit across from them on the map. This game could really use a VP counter of some sort.

This is board game awesomeness!  Developing a civilization, customizing ships for combat, exploring the unknown and exterminating your closest rivals . . . just doesn't get any better. This game will leave you awake at night reliving each move that you made, agonizing over each move that led to your destruction, or cherishing each move that led to sweet victory.  Had to overcome the stigmas associated with playing a sci-fi game (the gaming group consists of a good assortment of jocks with mocking wives and teenage daughters), but once you partake of the sweet nectar this game offers, you will gladly check your pride at the door.

I had a revelation the other day regarding this game.  I've played it five times now, and I've never had a good play experience.  Every time I play this game there is at least one person (usually two) that get completely screwed over through no fault of their own, and get stuck doing nothing while everyone else plays.

This simply isn't the game I want it to be.  The random nature of the exploration and tech tiles are simply too problematic to overcome.  Furthermore, it tricks you into thinking you can play a science strategy when conflict is really the only path to victory.  Look elsewhere for your 4X space game - this isn't it.

I am still very excited whenever I get a chance to play this. The ship design aspect is great: Every game you have different techs available and must work out how to combine them to make the best ships for your situation. Then you get to see how they perform in battle! Combat manouevering is simple but allows plenty of tactical choice. The economic aspect is streamlined and just deep enough to require serious attention, without overshadowing the ship design and combat. Lots of ways to earn VP and win even if you didn't win the inevitable massive fight at the end!

Desde luego no es mal juego. Sin embargo es un caso de Hype brutal. Es una mezcla entre eurogame y ameritrash pero a mi parecer no esta todo lo pulida que debería. La única ventaja es que se juega realmente rápido, sobre todo los primeros turnos.

Sin embargo, a mi parecer, el juego no trasmite la sensación épica que un juego de conquista espacial debería, en ese sentido es muy eurogame. Por otro lado tiene mecánicas extrañas como el hecho de que las losetas se coloquen a voluntad, de forma que tú diseñas el espacio que tienes alrededor (WTF!) o que puedas construir naves donde te de la gana (si tienes influencia) aunque haya enemigos en ese hexágono. Debería haber una especie de estación orbital que fuera donde se pudieran construir las flotas. Son sólo un par de ejemplos que, para mi, hacen que no sea el juegazo del que todos hablan.

Not a too complex, strategic game. It has an accpeted downtime and luck facor, however this  could be a bit less. Just like the similar games it has a longer than average setup phase, long rule explanation as there are many small details to understand, but neither of them is complicate, just a bit lot. The game machanic is fair good. It is not as perfect or elegant like in the good Euros but surely much better than most of the ameritrash games when you always forget something to do. The actions are quite fast only the research action can take a bit longer to select one from the available ship parts on the main table. The battle machanic is the best I have ever seen. It is simple, fast and exciting. The space requirement is large and because of it does not have a fix board it is getting bigger and bigger as the game goes by.

Eclipse is often described as a euro game disguised as a space opera, be that as a compliment or criticism. I expected smooth mechanics, low randomness and a less than great battle system.

The gameplay is smooth: using future income to take turns, which lets you increase your income on various tracks balances out beautifully. And because you only do one action per turn, the game is not hugely AP inducing. In a 6 player game you do have quite a bit of time to think about your next turn while waiting, especially because the turns of the non adjacent players (in the galaxy) don't really matter for you, unless they take a research that you wanted.

Researching and upgrading ships is fun. Some low cost technologies  (e.g. improved hull) seem straight up better than more expensive ones. The battle system is not as bad as i thought. It's still dice chucking with no decision making, but the ship upgrading mitigates this sufficiently. 

Randomness in other parts of the game was the biggest issue for me:
- random tiles during exploration, which can hugely affect  the early game
- random research tiles, in combination with galaxy tiles and the ressources on them.

For example: you draw a 2 planet system, one of which needs advanced mining, there is an ancient ship on the tile. You can't beat the ancient ship yet and there is no advanced mining availble until 2 hours later. Your opponent draws a 3 planet system (1 advanced). You draw a one (white) Planet system. Your opponent draws a 2 planet system. 

This is exacerbated by the alien races. Theoretically you can choose your own strategy, but the races change the value of your actions (as they should) and the relative value of each planet type. Your strategy is limited by the ressources you find, and if these don't line up you end up thinking: "I wish I could do these cool things my race can do, but I can't."


Other random thoughts:
Snowballing in economy (random) -> upgrades is likely impossible to overcome.
The art is alright. Looks impressive on a desk.
The galaxy feels small.
Time is often spend searching through bags and piles of upgrades or rolling dice instead of making decisions.
Some actions are much better/used more often than others.

All in all I like the game and see its upsides but the underlying randomness made the game a slight disappointment. Without the randomness the game would still not feel as exciting as I wish it would for the length. There are better economic games, better area control games and maybe even better economic area control space 4X games than this.

I have only played this once and I want to play it again.  I was expecting to like this based on the hype and high ratings.  I was disappointed that it did not live up to what I expected.  It suffered from the same problems as other games of this type.  One person was left alone and won.  One person got bad explore draws and was out of the game early with a long way to go.  The players with the big guns ruled.  I could not get the gun tech and so my huge armada was useless.  When I finally attached another player who had one star base and two average tech ships to defend with they magically built ships until they had more than my 6 ships then increased their tech until it was better than mine and I got plastered.  I think you should buy ships one turn and place them the next turn.  I think it would take some time to build a few star ships instead of here comes an attach lets whip up four ships in an instant.  I will see if another play changes my mind, but at this point I do not get the love with this one.

I was very impressed by my initial game of Eclipse. This is an excellently designed game that had plenty of tough and interesting decisions at every turn. The variable player powers of the various alien races ensures there is plenty of different paths to explore in this 4x game. 

I was also very impressed with the player boards which alongside Terra Mystica are some of the best game aids I've ever seen. Both do a great job of communicating a lot of information to the player quickly and easily. The other real genius in Eclipse lies in how you get to customize and outfit your ships with the various technologies in the game. Want to make a bunch of super fast ships armed with missiles? Go for it. Want to make something that is super tanky and can take tons of hits? All yours. Want to just load up on guns and targeting computers? Can do that too. And all the options seem nicely balanced such that one can viably take all of these various paths to success. 

I'm looking forward to getting to play this again, and may even want to buy this for myself, even though the long playtime and fairly heavy ruleset means I'm not likely to play it very often. I can see this rating rising with recreated plays as well as I learn more about the depth of the game. 

Overall though this is an impressive design that manages to capture the epic feeling of a space 4x in a nice playing time.

Boy, where do I start... best 4X game I've ever played. I just love the diversity, the setup, the configuration and how the game unfolds in time. You have to optimize, you have to react. It's a great conflict game, carefully designed and balanced. There are different ways to win and you cannot determine your strategy at the beginning, as the world will change around you. You are forced to maximize your score, but also to fight. At the end, it's still uncertain, who gets the best score, which I think is great. Love the game, even when I'm losing. 

It has a lot of components, but you'll quickly find that you don't have to be concerned with all of them. Great mechanics and game interface makes it very easy for you to have all the information you need. With proper storage solutions (baggies, GMT trays), game setup and operating is a breeze (though putting the game back in the box still takes some time). People complain about quality, but I don't see it. Yes, ships are plastic and they're might be not very detailed, but you look at them from some distance and it's easy to distinguish what is what. Maybe the starbases being the cardboard token and not plastic ship is a little bit confusing. Tokens are very informative and easy to read/understand. Player mats are a genius at work example. Only the race graphics feel a little uninspired and flat (especially the constant-PMS human ladies).

I want to play this more, but the table space needed and the time investment both prevent me from being able to. I love love love the ability to fully customize your ships, instead of just linear upgrade tracks. It makes them feel "different" rather than "better" or "worse" than other players' (although the latter can certainly still happen). My biggest complaint is with the unreliability of the player mats to hold cubes in place. There are several third-party retailers that sell plastic trays to help, though, which is great.

RATING: 7
Played this Essen 2011 hype monster only once. It is a neat game but all in all, it is not as good as people make it out to be, at least, not for me. The theme does not interest me at all. Whenever people moan about the same old generic fantasy mumbo jumbo, like orcs, elves and dwarfs, I get excited, I am a post-Tolkien man through and through. But talk to me about wormholes, plasma guns and planets and I start snoring sooner than you can say 'Bones McCoy'. 

Apart from that, I found that the game lacks interaction, where is the trading, diplomacy, sweat-inducing negotiations, alliances, laws that bind you you to do certain things, interactive victory conditions (apart from wars. Most of the time, I found that people just build and dwell on their little separate boards in Agricola style and I general don't like games where people have their own boards, that spells multi-solitaire like nothing else. 

Also, just like many 'old' wargames (Game of Thrones / Risk), this game has no catch-up or balancing mechanism in place for players who get left behind. Unlucky tile draw in the first few rounds ? Tough cookies, you are probably out of the winner's race for good. Two players decide to crush the last player and eliminate him from the game ? Call your grandma, your coming home, but the game does not help you at all. How about bonus chips for whoever has the lowest in science, resources and money each turn ? Something like that would cut it, so the design, while elegant and polished is outdated in my opinion.

On the upside, I do like the playing time, rules are clear and the design feels polished so that the flow of the game is very good, when compared to similar games such as Twilight Imperium.

If you love space games that are a tad dry and Euro, this is for you. To me, it feels more like space tax return than space opera, too much work, not enough fun.

RATING: 7
There are a few things that really bug me about this game that make it go from exceptional to just really good. 1) Hidden victory points - I have no idea who is winning and what I should do about it. This is fairly common in Eurogames and I am generally not a fan of that. 2) Exploration is highly luck-driven. Both games of Eclipse I've played, one player drew a set of bad hexes and really was at a disadvantage. 3) Nearly impossible to win without combat - the game gives too many victory points for combat vs. other aspects. 4) Lack of true diplomacy/trading. The diplomacy that does exist is more a "if you attack me, you'll lose points" swap. Player cooperation and negotiation is pretty limited. It's still a fun game, but I think it could be much better.

I have not played Twilight Imperium yet, but I have high hopes that it's going to be the space epic I am looking for. I have a high level of tolerance for long games, so that's not going to be an issue.

Holy moly components. So much stuff. I've heard that it overstays its welcome, and gets a bit dull, which I felt quite a bit in a two player game. However, I see why people praise it, with all of its complex Euro decisions in a great theme. Still need to try it with more than 2 players. I really dislike the artwork and style of the tokens/cards, but that's just me. A pain to setup.

RATING: 3
Yet another cube pushing, economic engine Euro.

Rule complexity is on the same level as heavyweight Euros, but because luck plays a significant role in this game, it's really a middleweight when it comes to strategy.

The number one reason why I do not enjoy Euros is that I feel like I'm playing against a system rather than my opponents. Eclipse is no exception. Most of the time, players are looking at their individual player mats, the available technologies to purchase, and their area of the board/universe. Only near the end of the game do players start to worry about their opponents.

THE space empire building game that you always wanted games like TI to be (but somehow those other games always let you down).

A realistic playing time of 30 minutes per player once you know the rules, a tech tree, military expansion being one way to win but not the only way (and military defeat being something that it's perfectly possible to recover from), the usual Euro agony of wanting to do 5 things but only having 3 actions left this turn - this all adds up to a very good game.

My favourite game from Essen 2011.  The first time I played it (taking about 3.5 hours), I immediately reset the board and wanted to play it again. (The second game only took a shade over 2 hours).

I've played the game over ten times so far (pretty unusual for me), and can discern only three flaws.  I could live without the dice rolling for combat (largely because my rolls are almost always indescribably bad).  The plastic space ships are mediocre.  And it needs a big table (even 3-player takes a fair amount of space).  But these are small flaws, and in every other way the game is fantastic.  

Increased my rating after having logged more plays.

It is entirely likely that who will win and loose will have been decided by turn three, only to have 4 more hours of tedious Sisyphean actions left before the game can finally end.  

There are some excellent design choices here to be sure;  I like how research and ship customization is handled in particular.  Unfortunately they are buried under an avalanche of randomness and clunky combat mechanics.

A total classic. I REALLY enjoy this one. Each game can be so different depending on who you play with, how the tiles come out and also massively different based off reacting to what players are doing.

Probably the best 4x boardgame you can get, due to time, strategy, and theme.  It's the only game I would give a perfect 10.

Update - 
I still love this game.  After playing another game that I would currently consider better overall, I had to drop this game's score to 9.5 .  After countless plays, the reasons I dropped the overall score are:
5 or more players tends to cause the game to lose focus, since there is so much going on and turns take slightly too long in my group with too many players.  I have now played very complex games where this doesn't happen, so I know it's possible.

Tried the prototype which was a very promising little game, combining Master of Orion, Attika, Through the Ages -type elements into a single solid spacefaring epic. Very easy to play, very interesting choices to make and even getting that "holy shit, whoa!" -feeling out of a game in a prototype phase has to be worth something :)

Addition: Playing the real thing reinforces what I wrote above; this is an excellent game which goes to great lengths in ensuring that you're always on the ball with how your empire is doing and completely drops any tough calculations from the equation. This was a blast to play and all the first-timers marvelled at how simple it all is in a game that encompasses so many thematically complex individual parts.

I didn't believe the hype behind this game but I'll admit it is very deserving of all the praise it has received. Easily the best space civilization game I've played.
There seems to be many paths to victory, with a multitude of different combat or diplomatic strategies. 
Playing with the human boards is nice and balanced. I've yet to try the alien boards but after inspecting them I'm not convinced they're quite equal in power. Hard to judge the balance there.
For a game like this, Eclipse plays pretty fast. Nine rounds can start to feel like a long time, especially towards the end when players might have explored the majority of the available tiles and now must turn to combat for bonus points. Knowing when to turn and fight is key.

RATING: 7
Eclipse really is a full 4X game, nicely scaled down to play in an evening rather than a weekend. I liked the randomization of the appearance of tech tiles, the separation of actions from combat, and the nice hedge of being able to play minimal "reactions" after passing on further major actions. So far, I've played with two, three, and five players, and it works well in all cases.

Thoughts after one play.

It felt epic...and had me totally engaged in the theme throughout. Many "edge of your seat moments"...when one person develops some new tech or builds a new craft and suddenly the other players nervously look across the table wondering what he will do with it and whether they need to launch a preemptive strike.

Look forward to playing it again.

An interesting system for balancing actions and control off cost of upkeep is entirely ruined but profoundly random gameplay.

Combat? Worth between 1 & 4 vps. (Ignoring all the dice heavy rolls to begin with)

Explording? It could grab you VPs, tech, planets to comonize or screw you with unbeatable (in the early game) NPCs.

It just isnt worth more than the sum of its parts....which are euro economics wrapped in a blanket of Ameritrash.

What a great immersive game! The way combat is designed and linked to upgrades in technology is fantastic. Unlike other mammoth games in which after 6 hours of play the game is decided by one card that allows you to break the rules or the luck of the dice, this game doesn't feel like a waste of time and really gives you the feeling of developing and expanding culminating in a deserved win. And it doesn´t feel like you've been playing for 6 to 8 hours...

I have only played Eclipse once, but I was very underwhelmed. On paper this games sounds good: exploration, tech trees, modifying your ships, space battles, variable player powers. But for me, those did not come together. You can have quite a bad start, when flipping not so good star systems, and then your opponents are killing creeps (ancients) to get early bonuses, which results in a runaway leader problem. All combat strategy aspects of the game felt very static. So this is to me a Euro-Ameritrash-Hybrid, which does not do the crossover very well. Kemet, for example, does this crossover much better.

tl;dr: Enjoyable & elegant game with uninspiring art & ships.

I've played this game several times.  Some with just 2, some with 3, and one game with 5.  I don't know that we've actually ever played out the full game, but have usually stopped a round or two short of a full game due to time.  I love the theme and the mechanics can be summed up in one word: Elegant.  It's a fantastically designed game.

I find the art lackluster & the plastic ships uninspiring, which takes away from the overall enjoyment a bit for me.  Even with those gripes, though, the ships are very functional and everyone that has played it has had a great time.  I'm looking forward to another 5 player game in the near future with the same group that's played it before.  I'm hoping we'll actually get to finish a game this time.

Revised rating down. For all the bells and whistles, Eclipse is another "let's you and him fight" game. All of the problems with that genre (momentum, bash the leader, death spiral, metagame bickering) are evident. And the initial setup is absolutely crucial in determining the outcome 2-3 hours later. Still, a decent enough game. Four is probably the idea player count - any more and downtime once you're out of contention becomes an issue.

========================================================

After all the hype, I was prepared for this to be a let-down. I was pleasantly surprised. Very finely honed and intuitive system - after the first half-hour we didn't open the rules once. It's basically Master of Orion in boardgame form, which is a very good thing. Loved the ship build decisions. However, not having access to resources early is a huge handicap.

Was excited to get a chance to play this one. Very nice game with a lot going on. I did not have much clue about how to approach this one during my first play and it showed as I finished in last place by a long long way. 

The game stayed in my mind for a few days after the play with me thinking about other strategies and plays I could try which is always a great sign. As it stands, given the game length and my current free time situation, I doubt I will be able to play this one very often... But, I will likely buy the iOS version and play it a ton.

Recently played, and I love this one.  It's all the joy of a huge 4X game without spending 12 hours at it.  It's a delight.

My only kvetch about this game is the artwork and background.  The background is stale and flat, and the artwork is functional, but not exciting.  That's a pretty minor kvetch.

UPDATE, 3/15/15: It's been a couple years since that first post, and this one has dropped in my estimation.  The artwork and game mechanics are flat, and I have a hard time getting the game to do what I want.  It seems like I'm always behind the curve.  It could just be that I suck at this game.

I much prefer TI3.  It's more intuitive, it doesn't have as many fiddly bits, and even though it plays longer, I'm much more involved in the play of the game.

So after first play it's on the top of my list, great mechanics and awesome components.

Beautiful game, with fine tuned action turn mechanics, lots of tech to choose from, explore and build phases that all work together extremely well. 

We have played it with 3, 4 and now 6 players and all were interesting and fun. 6 player a bit long but compared to other similar epic Space games the nine turn limit is perfect. Can't wait for the expansion.

Finally got to play this on Tuesday. (20-01-2012)
Took a turn or two to get an idea of game mechanics and initially i liked the choices you have to make.  However, this is more a war game than a civilisation game in space.  There is no incremental tech tree, which I would have expected to see as part of the research options.  The research itself was more focused on improving your ships, rather than your civilisation.
The ship templates and customisation options available are very good, but again, in the sense resource management towards building better fleet and not the epic space race I was hoping for.

Wow, almost a year between games.  Got to play with a bit more info and can see that there are far more ways to win than taking the middle, which of course is exactly what i did this time.

Managed to get another game under my belt and despite forgetting some of the mechanics everyone had fun.  Really enjoyable.

Perhaps the most interesting feature is that, using the technologies you acquire during the game, you can customise your own ships, to allow them to move faster, have better weapons, superior defences, or meet whatever other needs you require for them. There is also a very interesting economic system - aside from science which you need to research technologies, and materials which you need to build ships and a few other things, there is money, which you need to pay more of the more actions you take in a turn, as well as the more tiles you control. This is nice and thematic, you feel that you have "overstretched" yourself, and this limits the number of actions you can take without going bankrupt and knocking yourself out of the game.

Despite all these nice features, though, this isn't a game I've played many times, nor one that I am particularly keen to play again. Playing it, while interesting, is just not all that fun an experience (although it certainly isn't bad), and it does feel very dependent on luck - not only dice rolls in combat, but also what tiles you draw (this is probably the most consistent frustration, you desparately need money or materials-producing planets and can't find any, or you find ancient ships everywhere which you don't yet have the ships to be able to safely take out), and how the new technology tiles come out. I can understand why there is such love for this game here on BGG, and as I said it is a very interesting design, but for me personally it is not a game I can fall in love with.

Vielleicht das (auch von mir) am meisten überschätzte Spiel der Jahre 2011/2012. Meine – freilich nicht repräsentative – Erfahrung mit dem Spiel zeigt zwei Hauptprobleme, die sich auf eine falsch oder nicht konsequent getroffene Design-Entscheidung zurückführen lassen: Die Entwickler waren unentschieden, ob sie eher ein Wargame oder eher ein Eurogame abliefern wollten - und haben sich dann tendenziell doch für ein Eurogame entschieden. Zwei wesentliche Konsequenzen: Zuviel Ökonomie (obgleich mit intelligentem Mechanismus, aber das kann Ökonomie grundsätzlich nicht retten) und zuviel Zufall (eigentlich ja kein Charakteristikum eines Eurogames): das Ziehen von Victory Points, die Zusammensetzung der Galaxis, der zufällige TechTree, die Kämpfe. Als ein kleineres Problem kommen eine teilweise hohe Downtime und wenig ausbalancierte Alien-Rassen (ich sage nur: „Orion Hegemony“) hinzu. Vielleicht werden einige dieser Mängel mit der ersten Erweiterung abgestellt oder abgemildert.

RATING: 6
(Based on one play so far)

Eclipse has a lot of things I like in a game. But it does have problems in the randomness and luck.

Like any exploration/resource game, early development can snowball in future turns. And so, following some poor exploration, I found my economy almost completely tanked by turn 3, making me a very clear "4th player" in our 4 player game. I launched a war on the top player, just to give me at least a slight chance of doing something in the game. All I really did was allow the eventual winner to turtle his way to a very easy win.

I'd give the game another try, but I do feel like there is something severely lacking in this game. I don't know much about the expansions, but I'm hopeful that they help address the issues I see.

Delivers on an epic 4x game in a very short amount of time. It definitely feels like a 10 the first play, great stuff. Over more plays though I feel the lack of a catch up mechanism hurts this game, combine it with the OP missile tech and the game comes down a bit ratings wise. Although the game is quick oddly enough I think the last few turns are pretty much irrelevant to the winner who has usually broken away by then.

Luck drive game with combat, technology and exploring systems, runaway leader syndrome and very very very fiddly with all the counters.

RATING: 8.4
(+) Develops interestingly 1: the way space exploration plays out with the 3 different sectors, stimulating players to first go outwards and explore and when they are more powerful to grow towards each other in center space. The central tile with the strong elders' station also brings in an interesting dynamic.

(+) Develops interestingly 2: the way tech upgrades are aquired is nice: a limited amount of possible technologies, and a rather dynamic tech tree (a technological leap costs more tech points than slowly building up, but it is possible if necessary). Technologies feel meaningful and are fun to play with.

(+) Develops interestingly 3: alliances with mutual advantages, adaptations to space ships, ...

(+) Rather easy and structured gameplay. Few to no fiddly rules or exceptions. Rather easy to explain and really a reasonable play time for a game of its epic scope.

(+) Lots of races (different factions) to play with, bringing variety to the game. They all play very differently.

(-) For a long and epic space exploration and civilization title, there is too much randomness. This can mainly be problematic while exploring (tile draws), hoping for technologies to come up, tile draws after conquering and combat (dice rolls). However, usually the game evens out and normally it rewards good gameplay.

(-) The result of combat can be rather devestating. It is probably hard to win the game only by combat, but it is easy to lose when a stronger opponent crashes your civilization. A good point in the game is that the advantage always goes to the defender (he doesn't have to spend actions on movement, the initiative advantage goes to him and he can muster up cheap but effective star bases when under attack). These principles should avoid unreasonable combat outcomes, but still: it can be hard to impossible to defend against a single player with unique powerful military technologies without spending all your actions just on pinning his entire fleet down.

(-) It is possible to be eliminated from the game before it is over, however, this is highly unlikely to happen.

(-) Minor complaint: very poor choice for colors to represent science, economy and materials: pink, brown, orange - but really, they all are a different shade of brown -> can be confusing :)

Es cierto que en determinados momentos peca de aletorio. Además, quizá por la poca experiencia de los jugadores, en algunas rondas te podías ir tranquilamente a tomar un café mientras se solucionaban los combates o las acciones... 

...Pero: el juego es muy divertido, aparentemente se pueden desarrollar diferentes estrategias (yo gané sin pegarme con nadie, fabricando monolitos), de lo mejor que he probado de este género de juegos.

Destaca el diseño de los componentes, muy funcional y muy bien integrados con las mecánicas del juego.

I could live with the dice rolls, but combine it with luck based system build, heavy luck based VP chips and a feeling of isolation because it is too easy to hide from enemies, doesn't offer any good solution for odd number of players, which ends up with unbalanced starting positions.

After four plays or so, I think I can safely say this game is a winner for me.  I've had very, very bad luck during exploration in the last couple of games, resulting in a predictable loss and a surprising win with a different alien and strategy.  I think there's a lot of variety here, the mechanisms are elegant and without any hint of clunkiness (except for combat resolution, which I'd like to find a way to streamline or automate), and the user interface is excellent.  Can't wait to play again.

A very clean and streamlined design, after our first play we were blown away with how easy the game was to pick up rules wise.

A lot of depth and highly strategic, I look forward to playing again.

A true gem of a game and definitely worth the hype.

The game rewards multiple plays to start developing strategy's.  The game engine is so intuitive, so well balanced.

I wanted to like this game more, the reality is that it has laid dormant and unplayed for far far too long.  Still within the gaming group but should make someone else happy.

Great game but my group of friends is not often in an appropriately aggressive frame of mind to get the most enjoyment out of it; i.e., conflict is highly rewarded but my gaming group tends to enjoy cooperation over conflict. A major drawback to the game is the length of time it takes to play. Setup and cleanup time is long even after adding a box insert to help with organization. I'm not very good at this game but I still enjoy it. I've never won, or even come close; still, it doesn't seem to matter. You'd think it would become frustrating but the challenge of building my empire is tremendously engaging.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
This is a really great game.  I can see it maybe eventually getting old, but for now, it is just super fun, deciding how to tailor your ships and whether you want to focus on exploring a lot of the outer region, or push in on other players.  The competing over limited techs adds just enough variation between games, as well as seeing how to best play each of the aliens against each other. The only reason I don't give it a 10 is that it can go a bit long.  I think reducing the number of III tiles and reducing the number of rounds by 1 or 2 might be a good way of shortening the game time a bit while not losing any of the enjoyable mechanics.

Update: Still enjoying it, but the last few turns do seem to drag.  I like the idea of a house rule that you start rolling a die at the beginning of rounds 6-9, with increasing chance that the game will end; this will give some uncertainty of how many turns you have left to do what you want.  I do also feel that there is still an advantage to hunkering down and let others fight with each other.  Apart from Orion, attacking other players only hurts both your chances of winning.  I also wish there was more diversity in tech, or some species-specific techs, so you really felt like each alien had different ships and tactics a la Star Control.

Update Update: I still really like this game, but I'm feeling it is a bit too long for what it is, and the combat is feeling less fun for me.  Unless you are generating so much brown income that you are maxed out on ships and basically want to lose them so you can build more, combat still seems unattractive, boring, and random to me, compared to my other multiplayer wargame favorites like Maria and Game of Thrones.  The basic attraction for me is trying out all of the races and different strategic paths, but the actual game play is becoming a bit same-y for me and I am just wishing the game was under 2 hours.  Maybe I just need to stick to 3-4 games and avoid 5+.

Update Update Update: Just too random for me to bother playing anymore.  Bad tile draws can really screw a player, putting them in an unwinnable position after just 3-4 turns - it's not fun to have another player not having fun.  And combat is too random - it's sucks to roll badly, but it's almost worst to defeat a player that should have won easily but got really unlucky.

RATING: 6
Only a sample run through and then a 4 player game with all new players but I really enjoyed this one. I think the time will get down to a reasonable 30 minutes per player with people that know how to play. The game took us a little over 3 hours with setup and tear down, and we took our time for sure. 

Rating could easily go up with more plays and with different player configurations. 

Update: After more plays this slid. It's just not that much fun. The initial tile draw appears to be more important than I had thought originally. For a medium to long game there is more randomness than I care for and the core mechanics tend to push you in one direction. I don't consider this a true 4X game.

Huh...what a rush. This is perfection. A very rare combination of thematic and 'euro' game mechanics (in fact I don't know any other?) where both angles work seamlessly together. Great components (well worth the 60 EUR price tag), excellent rules (often overlooked quality), thematic art. There's a lot of going on but thanks to the straightforward, logical and intuitive rules there was no need to check the rules after the first game. The board also list almost every rule in the rulebook which in fact should be true for all games, shouldn't it? Another amazing thing is the balance. There's several ways to victory and none of them seem too overpowering. You can the turtle-strategy or go for all out war and either can result in a victory. I bet this game is going to be #1 in BGG before the end of 2012.

This is a BRILLIANT game, one of those whose quality really strikes you the first time you play it. It is THE space opera, empire building game that I have been looking for: epic yet streamlined, sufficiently deep yet highly playable.

HIGHLIGHTS: 

* Tech Tree: random tech draws give variability between games. It's fairly open what you can develop, but if you have researched a tech in a particular field already, it's cheaper to develop new ones in the same field. The result is a simple yet elegant tech tree that nudges you in certain directions but is not too restrictive; highly efficient.

* The Resource System: using Through the Ages's idea of removing cubes on your player board as you expand your empire without that earlier game's fiddlyness; a wonderful design solution to the problem of bookkeeping.

* Building your Ships: my favourite part; you can upgrade your own ships so that each player's ships are individual and each player can develop their own military doctrine, so to say. This is all done in a way with ship blueprints and tiles that removes any form of bookkeeping. 

* Action System: a brilliant method of action selection, whereby taking actions and expanding use the same resource (action disks--which like the other resources you remove from your board, exposing the increasing upkeep costs as you use more disks), thereby balancing how much you can do and how much you can expand. 

* Incentive to Fight Early On: the method of awarding VPs for combat (which you draw from a bag and choose the best) give you an incentive to attack early on, as the chances are that at the end of the game only the low value chits will be left.

* Expansion: the explore action is cleverly handled so that you quickly expand, bringing you into conflict with your neighbours very soon. There is no long build up before you get your empire onto a war footing.

All in all, a wonderfully designed game that is a lot of fun to play; you will end up thinking the game a lot after playing it.



HOWEVER, in the interests of balance, two RESERVATIONS:

* It's not so good as a two-player game: one player often gets a technology advantage over the other and is normally in a dominant position by the 6th or 7th turn; it can be interesting to match up the different aliens against each other, but you really need other players to balance out any lucky advantages one player may get. Buy it for multi-player, not two-player, play.

* I do think the plasma missiles are a tad too strong, especially relative to the anti-matter cannon. I look forward to the expansion and the promised plasma missile countermeasure. Still, players should be aware of the danger of an opponent fitting up dreadnoughts with missiles and +3 computers and be able to counter it before they become a threat.

This game is appealing to me on a lot of levels. The big tiles look great and all of the different boards look awesome.

I wouldn't play this game with 6 again, but 4 and 5 are both great counts for this.

I first played this game at the WBC and haven't been able to stop! It is easily my favorite game. Some negative comments complain of too much luck I would disagree entirely. Although, yes some luck is involved it is minimal. Get a tile draw you don't like? There is a reason you can choose to pass on it. You don't like rolling 6's to make a hit? That's why there are computer techs to improve your odds. Don't like that your opponent has computers? Add some shields.

This is a great area control game with economical elements and an awesome ship customization mechanic.  I've always loved acquiring technologies in games, but I haven't seen anything quite like this, where you then take what you have researched and implement it on your ships as you see fit.  The attitude towards combat depends on the players' attitudes, but I think leans more towards the tendency for players to control an area using the "threat of combat", which is a style I may prefer but some players may not.

I have seen too many discussions comparing this game to Twilight Imperium, and many comments on both sides which I disagree with.  I think that the idea that this is "Twilight Imperium-lite" is silly; they're very, very different, having almost none of the same strengths.  I think those knowing comments that "Eclipse is really a Euro game" are facile; it's somewhere in between, like most games, and anyway, who cares?  Above all, I think the two games are both good, and so different from each other that I almost doubt that anyone who would pit them directly against each other has played both games correctly.

One definite complaint: this game claims to support up to 7 players or 9(!) with expansions.  These seems to be a lie.  The map changes little to accommodate these large player counts, and in the one game I played with over 6 players, we encountered serious issues and the game took an absurd amount of time, after which everyone was quite ready to be done with it.

I payed a fortune in Essen 2011 to get it, giving up other great games. It stayed in my cupboard for a while, being scared of being dissapointed.

It is the game, one of the best ever, if not the best. No flaws, not boring at all, no downtime and I can list several more "no" to say good things about the game!

My friends are wishing for an Italian version and a friendly distributor.

I played 11 times in 2 weeks and will keep going. Rating upgraded from 10 to 11 if possible :)

Rating after 1 play.

Much more of a resource management game then a galactic civ or war game. Yes, there is combat, but most of the time was spent of exploring (flipping over space tiles and then placing your influence discs and resources cubes on the tile) and upgrading your ships. Some of the tiles have neutral enemies (the ancients!) on them that you must defeat in order to claim the resources, so your ships have to be up to the task. There were a few PvP combats, but not much, which is what I expected. It seems a safer option to just explore and take those (usually) free resources than to battle for those already on the board. But having the option is nice. 

I won with 33 points.

Great first play.  Ian did pull out computerized missile cruisers and they may be broken.  Would like some agreement on a fix but it was still a great game and can see it being a hit for a long time to come.

Didn't like it as much on the second play.  I am pretty sure missles are overpowered and it is hard to overcome a bad start position.

Upped my rating on a great third play.  We added 1 energy cost to missiles which helped but as I was playing the Hegemony it didn't stop me too much.

Through the Ages meets Twilight Imperium. Mechanics are elegant and promising, but not everything works as it should. The main problem here is that, for a 4X game, you're very limited in your options for expansion. Bordering with only two players and being in alliance with at least one of them early on for the extra production it gives you, you essentially have no choice of your victim. The road to other players leads through the centre of the galaxy, occupied first by powerful aliens and then by the strongest player, so you attack who you can rather than who you should - the leader. There's also no way to gang-up on someone, so it feels overall more like a euro then ameri, albet a long one, clocking at least 45 minutes for player rather then advertised 30. This however means that the high randomness of battles and luck in discovering new sectors as well as in getting the more powerful (missiles next to imbalanced) technologies feels out of place and is not welcome. You don't want to carefully calculate your options, wait for the other 5 players to complete their turns and then have it all spoiled by bad luck.

RATING: 8
Although my only play of this game so far was tedious in the extreme, I can see it being better with the right players, so I'd be reasonably happy to give it another shot. To me the games design feels a bit loose and somewhat bland, although I do quite like the graphic design and aesthetic.For epic multi player combat games, I would contrast the experience with A Game of Thrones and the Starcraft Boardgame - in both those games two players getting locked into a feud still have a chance of winning I would think (albeit one greatly reduced) - in Eclipse the cost of combat is too great, as other players can just keep building up their units and capabilities, with nothing to hold them in check. 

(Edit after a second play, 3 players): The timing of conflict is important in this game, and will change depending on the actions of players. The game rewards early conflict, but I guess that Monoliths and Plasma Missiles between them provide two very effective answers to a purely military strategy - by all means, build your killer fleet, but don't expect the game to be a walkover. With 3 players was a very fun way to spend 3 hours, and my earlier experience was considerably mollified. Rating upped!

Plays smoothly. At 30 minutes per player this probably plays best with four as a balance between game length and interaction. Unfortunately all things are not quite equal as players initially expand and either come across free resource spaces or military might they're just not equipped to handle until turn three. (Try being surrounded by four ancients tiles on your opening two turns and having a shot at winning.) The development of your technologies and modification of ships is done very well and is really the lure for me to explore this game further. Having played Merchants and Marauders in the same week as this I can't help compare their dice combat. Although Eclipse is simplified it lacks the decision making during combat you find with Merchants and Marauders (particularly with the boarding of ships), that really adds a certain spark over straight out dice rolls.

My defensive tip against missile heavy ships is to install those shields on your ships asap!

Eclipse is good stuff and a worthy 4x game.

A civ game playable in a reasonable time. There is some stuff that can be trace to other games, like the cube production system, similar to the one in [i]Through the Ages[/i], and some original features, like the action system based on chips, or the customizable space ships. I still think that [i]Galactic Emperor[/i] is the way to go for playing a civ game in space, but this also a god option for a change from time to time.

This game just doesn't do it for me. For how much I enjoy it, it's too long, and almost every aspect of the combat feels tacked on. Probably the coolest part is building your ship blueprints, but with combat being so boring/anti-thematic there's nothing interesting to do with those cool ships you built. The rest of the game is resource management, plays fine but doesn't evoke the feelings the game presents.

Eclipse took a few plays to grow on me. I think the main obstacle is getting familiar with the tech and upgrade tiles. Once that hurdle is cleared the game becomes more fun (though lady luck can still play too much of a role at times). 

Rating is based on Eclipse + Rise of the Ancients. Without the expansion I do not much care for the game, since it simply devolves into a scramble for missiles.

Eclipse is a masterpiece of board game design. My favourite aspect is that whoever wins will have deserved it based on his/her strategy, rather than lucky dice rolls (although these are also a factor). My two complaints would be that the ship design aspect greatly encourages isolationism and not actively attacking other players, and that encounters with Ancient Ships in the early game can easily make or break a faction.

Upgrading ships is a lot of fun, and gives some control over combat. The technologies are interesting, and help give variety to the game. I like the way the economic aspects of the game are implemented; the game is so streamlined that you just glance at your player board and know your income. All this without moving those cubes around very often. 

My main issue with the game is how randomness is implemented. There are a lot of options that go on ahead of time that go into improving your chances in combat, but the combat itself feels more random than I want in a game that is otherwise largely about economy and long term planning. Both the economic system and the combat system are functional, I guess it just feels a little odd that the two systems are included in the same game. The economic aspect is well implemented for a longer game of optimization, but the combat feels like it belongs in a shorter game. There are certainly many things you can do to improve your chances, and the better player will win the majority of the time, I just wish the combat felt more in line with the rest of the game.

RATING: 8
Feels like after my first play of Through the Ages: A Story of Civilization: the game seems awesome, but you're too much of a noob with tunnel vision to enjoy it for now. All of us could barely track our own stuff, let alone opponents', didn't dare to fight, and were too busy ironing out inefficiencies to worry about strategy (e.g. I'd upgrade my ships, then not use them, then research a better upgrade next turn... now I have to upgrade the suckas again, argh!!).

But I definitely want to play it a lot more, unlike with other games where I appreciate the design, but interest steadily peters out. Beats Through the Ages because the rules language is so much simpler and more intuitive, and it has an interesting board for real conflict. The game time is very manageable, the rules are unexpectedly simple, streamlined and intuitive (I can explain this to new players in 15min), but wow they nevertheless managed to fit [i]everything[/i] into this game.

Reputation Tiles - Nexus Ops Mission Cards (getting random VPs for small successes in battles)
Upkeep - any civilization game (I call this the main pre-req for a civ game), Agricola, Dungeon Lords
Combat - the Axis & Allies system, most similar to Hammer of the Scots. Also in Nexus Ops.
Discs/Cubes - Through the Ages (Happiness/Production) - more discs in play = higher upkeep, vs more cubes in play = more production
Player Mat and Action Cost - Hansa Teutonica - peel cube/disc off and read what's underneath. Both games allow uneven # of actions, but HT makes you weigh # of actions vs. ability of each action, while Eclipse makes you weigh the # of actions vs. monetary cost (can you afford to postpone the action to next turn, when it's cheaper?)
Supply Track / Tech Tree - a supply board like Puerto Rico, and discounts are possible (but to a certain point, like Quarries)
Start Player - like Agricola. Grab it first, the rest follow in seat order.

Not a lot of super-innovative stuff in this game (really just the cute ship customization, and the upkeep-for-variable-number-of-actions concept), but it's amazing how so many elements are packed so tightly and smoothly, with no confusing rules or ambiguous situations at all, like some fine vintage of extra virgin olive oil that just [i]glides[/i] down your throat without some grassy shit smell. It's ambitious and it pulls it off.

The perfect marriage of Eurogame and Ameritrash, uniting gamers of both types at a single table.

[u]Potential concerns[/u]

- Does the game railroad you too much into a strategy? (definitely not, right now, since I'm too overwhelmed to think long-term). I do like reactive luck though, and would have no problem with this, unless it completely handcuffs me from certain strategies.

- Missiles make battles lame when paired with good computers. 

- Boring components. Generic ships that seem to be from a parts store. Cubes/Discs. Money cylinder is shit brown and Material cylinder is dark shit brown, gah.

- Player differentiation is tacked on, 7 Wonders style. Not a big deal, just how it is. Probably even a compliment to the game that it runs so well on its tightly condensed engine, that any attempt at variable player powers just rings superficial.

===========

drunkenKOALA says, "Personally there is nothing awesome about Eclipse, but there is nothing bad about it, which I find very impressive. They managed to get all the chrome and essential elements of a space empire game (military, tech, economy, etc) together with almost no text. Every other space empire game has something "bad" about it complexity-wise. Eclipse is really simple and streamlined for its genre which is a huge plus for me. I think the custom ship upgrades is the best part, because there is actually a rps-like counter going on. I like the best part of 2v2 Starcraft a whole lot better than the best part of Eclipse; but I like the worst part of Eclipse a whole lot better than the worst part of Starcraft. "

Couldn't put it better myself. The high highs and low lows of Ameritrash are tempered by the mechanical consistency of Eurogames. Biggest complaint about Eclipse everywhere is [i]over-design[/i], engineered to the point of little dynamism (e.g. no cards, no 'unexpected'), which is the only thing that stops this from being THE game.

===========

Dreads with Missiles + Gluon Computers suck. Not broken, but does force all the players to react or die, which is too much of an impact on the game. And combat could be wilder: the fun's all in customizing the ships beforehand; actual combat is hard to pull off without hurting yourself, since you need many discs to build, move ships around, customize them, then have the bandwidth to colonize afterward.

[u]Four common rule variants[/u]
 - 18XX-style turn order (no-brainer, only left out of the game for lower complexity)
 - Ships moving through allied player's hex (not stopping) do not betray.
 - Variable game end, or (my likely preference) play to ~45-50 VPs, with Reputation Tiles only revealed when you announce you're past the game-ending VP limit (e.g. Catan).
 - Some kind of Missile+Computer nerf (like introducing an energy cost).

===========

On the downside, this game abstracted away all card luck (which I like due to the fat tail) in favor of dice luck. I miss cards sometimes when bringing this to the table.

5+3

Solid, fun game. Very good economics. Solid strategy, many different ways to win, especially with the race variants on character sheets, and customizable ships - which add many dynamics to the game. Am always willing to play if someone else suggests, but found myself not usually suggesting. Takes far too long to set up and to clean up, though - and games can take many, many hours, especially with more players.

Pieces can be knocked around and over far too easily, which can be extremely frustrating.

I bumped into this game completely by accident, being oblivious to the apparently significant hype levels.  I'm certainly glad I was able to play it as I completely enjoyed the experience.

It is an exploration and development game similar to Twilight Imperium.  Here, the exploration effect allows you build up the board in ways that benefit you and hinder (or help) your opponents.  While the luck in this is thematic, it can cause problems.  I feel that the game provides ample opportunity for overcoming initially poor luck.  Many others seem to disagree.

The tech tree is interesting.  I don't particularly like how the techs come out.  It would be nice if your player order could be manipulated to take advantage of this.  Unfortunately, it is blind guess.  That is probably the weakest portion of the game -- the person who has access to some of the best technologies is often a crapshoot.  

Beyond that, I enjoyed the rest of the game.  I like the way combat works for the most part.  I like the resource management, particularly the use of the discs to add significantly increasing costs to your expansion.  Ilike that you can still do things after passing if you really need to.  I've not played with the alien races yet, so I have no opinion on that.

I'm not sure how I feel about the set number of rounds.  It seemed to work out just right in our game.  I do like the various means of scoring victory points.  I'm not sure if it is the best way of determining the winner, but it certainly works.  

All in all, a game I am very happy with.  If I can get some more plays in, I expect that its rating can improve.  [07/08/2012]

Upgrading based on total 5 plays.

Based on two plays... great game so far in terms of engagement and strategy.
Some things are a little bit too random to my taste - esp. combat VP chits - I can see how random exploration and combat add to the game, but random VP award?
Won't comment on substance until more plays.

Major nitpick - some parts are really fiddly, unnecessarily so. For example, cube bars and influence track could all be replaced by one pile of tokens per player and 5 cardboard dials (base influence [adjusted to take/abandon sectors], current influence, 3 productions). Resource markers too... come think of it even colony ships. Cardboard dials are very resilient to shaky tables and don't need much table space.

Justin chooses the Terran Union and asks "Who are these people?" Oddly enough each otherwise identical human faction has a back-story. Someone describes them as a union and remaining neutral in everything. Justin: "Including gender". HAHA! So funny. You know what we mean if you've seen that woman(?). haha. Scary beyond all reason? Yeah, that's her.

My first game I played humans, and spent way too long teching up and building just the perfect ship before expanding. The game was over and I still hadnt done anything.
Second game I played the red aliens. Tried to expand quickly with their base tech (which dosent compliment eachother well). Things went OK, but having 2 less disks was just too detrimental in the long run. I really think they are a bad race.
Third game, I played Mechanima and was doing awesome. Likely in first at about halfway through the game. Decided to go traitor on the likely second place player. Unfortunately they were the tech race and bought plasma missiles, installed 4 on each ship and promptly removed me from the board..... Huh?... yeah apparently the only good defense for plasma missiles is to have them yourself, or put an unreasonable amount of hull on your ships. Unfortunately I had neither and didnt have that kind of science laying around to do the research. Seems pretty broken if you ask me. Apparently I'm not the only one since it looks like the majority of the expansion is ways to mitigate the problem.

Another problem of the game is there can definitely be player elimination, not really a fan of that in games.
Regardless, still a very fun game. Looking forward to playing more.

my rating has gone down every time I play.  This game is far too long to be decided on the last turn by dice rolling or back door assaults (wormhole generator).  Even though the dice rolling has mostly gone in my favor, I have no interest in ever playing this game again.  Eclipse is 90% ameritrash with a 10% euro veneer.

Never played, not even once, couldn't sell it on eBay for anything like a decent price, cannibalized it for game parts for other games, don't miss it. This game is a lame, watered-down, complete rip-off of TI3, I do not recommend it.

What sets Eclipse apart from other "civilisation" or "4X" games is the joy of building your ships and watch them fight. The whole part that made MtG drafting and sealed fromats fun was the fact that you build something which DID something (and not just, you know: deckbuilding for deckbuilding sake). The rating isn't higher, because as of now I'm not sure I'm fond of long games, or maybe it's just that I have one problem with civilisation genre: I want interaction NOW! Not 2 hours in the game. 

Edit: I don't like civ. genre. In Eclipse the best part is building ships and combat, but all the accountancy needed to get there (with AP from other players) and slow development before conflict begins.

Amazing space empire game... and it's just the right size. It's not too big, but not too small. It can aptly be called "Twilight Imperium Junior" in that you progress through it quickly, but still get the feel of running a big empire. Tons of fun with lots of people and just as much fun with less. Two can get predictable, but the expansion helps by adding ancient homeworlds for a challenge.

This quickly became one of if not my favorite game of all time. It is exactly the type of large, yet simple and comfortable for two people game that I have always wanted.

After just 2 plays I really love Eclipse. It won't get played a huge amount because it's a bit of a behemoth in terms of set-up/play and packing away takes you into, like, a third day. But the gameplay is great; if you like a sense of operatic drama with your economy and combat this will reward.

2nd most overrated game of all time. Waaaay too long for what it is. Decent fun, but wears out its welcome in the last hour.

Thebes mechanic is lame in this setting and has no place here. Game ends after a set amount of turns, also a lame mechanic that seems out of place.

RATING: 9
Extremely well designed game.  Has that MOO (Master of Orion) touch in which players can custom design their own ships.

Best part is that it has an epic space theme all the while being playable in under 4 hours.

Bit of a luck factor with how the exploration tiles spill out, and I'm not sure how play balanced the races are vis-à-vis the others.  

That said, this is an amazing game.

[1 play] I'm sure another play will clarify my feelings, and I could see my rating going up -- if:

A) the building of the ship technology proves to be more impactful of gameplay than it appeared to me initially.

B) the kingmaking endgame is not the largest determiner of outcome, which I fear it may often be.

Players start as a race in space, and use actions to do a variety of space-related moves. Build ships, research tech, move/explore, etc. The idea being to gains VPs from battles, colonising planets and upgrading technology.

Sounds exciting except that the game forces you through a cycle where you try to arm up before the last 2 rounds of tactical skirmishes to wrestle terrain off people. It's alot of work and time spent for very little payoff.

For a better, more compact experience, try Nexus Ops. It also has a tech tree, exploration and more importantly, dynamic more exciting battles.

great 4X space opera game with slick, elegant euro-mechanics. Clever time management due to limiting game to 9 rounds.

Here is a euro 4x game.  Don't mistake it for an opera like TI3 but that is a good thing.  It brings the space theme to life without feeling like a lesser version of TI.  A nice euro economic engine game were if the other player starts gaining to much of a lead you and other players can simply attack and destroy his/her economic engine.  With all the differing alien races the asymmetry is just enough to keep each experience fresh.   
------------------------------------------------------------Jan 2017 with the expansion it balances the broken parts of this game which is a good thing but the alliance win and higher player count are a poor thing.  Max players of 6 for this game.

Believe the hype! When I first heard of Eclipse I was only mildly interested. I already owned TI3 and felt that Eclipse would be too similar and thus unnecessary. Slowly I got more interested and after reading the previews & news I had to conclude that Eclipse is an altogether different beast than TI3. 

The design is beautifull, elegant and very polished.  Although I really like both TI3 and Eclipse I'd rather play the latter as it takes less time, less space, has less calculating and is way more streamlined. Oh yeah.. ship designing works really awesomely. On the component side Eclipse loses somewhat, but is by no means an ugly puppy.

7-hour game!  If my leg had been chained to the table, I would have been tempted to saw it off!

If you've got several hours, you might as well play something like Star Fleet Battles.  To me the whole building up your ships process is a complete waste of time.  (That's like going to a play a role-playing game meeting and everyone sits around for hours rolling up their characters)  Building up your ships should be done beforehand, especially for a long multi-player game.  Who wants to use your ships for attack purposes when you've spent HOURS building the damn things?  That makes your last few hours a complete waste of time!  And then your opponents get to keep their ships and become stronger for not engaging in combat?  You can't seem to move very far within a limited number of turns, etc.  Winning a game like this with bonus points instead of combat seems a bit lame too.

Admittedly, it could play better with fewer players.  My game started with 6 players until the instructor had to leave at which point it became a 5-player game.  I think two of the players who were going to join our game refused to play a 6-player version of this game.  I'm an old fan of Titan which is a game that can be very long and unwieldy with lots of players, but the expansion of territory and units seems to happen faster and better in Titan.  Thus, it might play "okay" as a two-player game.

This game seems to be much more popular in Europe than the United States.  I'm not sure why that might be except that perhaps there aren't enough copies in the United States yet.

The last turn of a game like this could get a bit silly with everyone trying to get one additional point to claim final victory.  I just wasn't prepared for the time length for this one.

This looks like my ideal game, in many ways.  I just hope the people I play against like it or it will be another expensive shelf decoration (e.g. Civilization, Arkham Horror)

Edit after 4 plays... I love seeing the change in people's faces when they go from "What the HELL is this overcomplicated geek space D&D game you are forcing me to play?"  to "OH MY GOD this is better than Agricola!"

Also note I am awful at this game and have never come better than 2nd last.  I really struggle to get my economy going. I think I over-explore at the start.

One of the area control behemoths, the game that added euro elegance to the TI3's meaty space opera package. The only substantial thing lost in the process is the unpredictability of action cards, that could turn the game upside down in Twilight Imperium, and the politics cards, which just needlessly dragged out the game. 

Both games have their merits and area control fans need both in their collections. If you want to buy only one and lean towards fairer rather than more outrageous experience, Eclipse is the way to go.

Tényleg jó, de nem annyira, amekkora őrület most övezi. Talán így lehet a legkönnyebben összefoglalni. Hosszabban nincs sok újdonság benne, de jó elemeket sikerült összegyúrni. Galaxis roncsderbis hajóépítés, tikalos felfedezés. Jól kiegyenlített, mégis különböző fajok, jól kitalált fejlődés, fix kör, emiatt lehet körülbelülire játékidőt is becsülni, több út a győzelemhez. Egyetlen negatívuma van a nagy szerencsefaktor. Legjobban a harcban zavart. Hiába jobb sokkal a cirkálóm, ha 1-eseket dobok, játék dőlhet el rajta. Hiába termelek sok építőanyagot, ha nem jut nekem a fő pontot hozó monolit fejlesztésből. Ha nagyon rosszul húzok a felfedezéseim sem érnek annyit, mint másoké. Legjobban a harci szerencse zavart, meg lehetett volna ez jobban oldani. Kevés játékosnál nem feltétlenül van sok harc és egy-egy nagyon sok mindenről dönthet. Illetve kicsit sok fejlesztés van a hajókhoz, talán felesleges volt bele ennyit tenni. Összességében nem rossz játék, sőt mindenképp élvezetes, sok jó mechanizmussal, bárcsak ezt a szerencsefaktor tudnám feledni. Azt még hozzátenném, hogy a sokak által a hosszabb szabálymagyarázat miatt nem bevállalt Starcraftot nem érzem rosszabb játéknak.

[2013-05-04]
Második játékra is tetszett, de nem változott a véleményem, nagyon sok helyen benne van a szerencse és kicsit hosszú. 6-an biztos nem ülnék le hozzá.

Lukewarm after first play, as it felt sort of geometrical. Up a notch after 4 factions solo play: this game has pretty much got it all, and achieves a remarkably well balanced mix of luck and strategy, hidden and open information.

Iv played this game several times now, about 8 id say. I really enjoy the "engine" building aspect. However, I do have some gripes with the system.

A rare tech might come up and you passed to get first dibs. But you dont have enough tech points to grab it. Not everyone can get the same tech you buy (which has its benifits).

I think a simple solution would be that you can use someone elses techs but you need to owe them research points to be able to use them, its a one time deal.

The above section will prevent one player from getting over powered very quickly. Thats the worst thing when someone buys ion cannons and you literally can not stop them
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Seems great overall. There's some asymmetry in the factions (although not balanced: black aliens seem incredibly strong and red are very weak). The disc mechanic makes larger empires inherently more inefficient so they need to carefully consider expansion options. I liked that strategic fleet placement and the threat of a fleet-in-being can be a winning factor.

I question the battle system a little: obsessive focus on initiative and a bit of a dice-rolling fest.

Solid well-tuned game, but very conservative. I'd rather play something like TI3, Clash of Cultures, etc.

Building your ship is pretty fun, and the combat system is pretty cool, but there isn't really a payoff: the end game is horrible, with usual FFA kingmaking problems and just a soulless point grab that makes it feel like your whole 3 hours was spent building towards... nothing exciting, really.

Perfect 4x game.  So much bang for your buck.  Simple and clean with lots of fun choices.  It screams along at a choppy pace, and has you engaged the whole time.  

The alien races are really fun.

My only complaint about the game is the inclusion of the 4 tiles in the bag for fighting.  Because there are 1 tiles and the 4s are four times worth the result for the same amount of effort, the result is extreme (better than taking the main homeworld). That mean that someone could easily get lucky and draw the three fours which is as much as almost maxing out on all the tech trees. and often more than anything you actually do on the board. So I just took mine out and left them in the box.

Possibly the best space themed euro/epic game I've played. It's a 50/50 balance between euro resource management and epic exploration/battle.

Definitely a Euro-version of a 4X game, but with lots of randomness.  It's a worker placement game.  The Influence disks are workers that are assigned to various actions and also uncork the economic game elements in the form of "exploration".  A randomly picked buffet of commodities  (cabbages/paints/technology) are added each turn for players to scrabble over in a first-come-first-served smorgasbord to provide enhancements to their farms/cathedrals/spaceships.  It's called "research" in the game.  Combat is silly.  I attacked an Ancient with two interceptors, two Cruisers and a Dreadnought and rolled dice repeatedly for almost five minutes trying to get sixes.  The entire game can unfold and key technology would never be available.  For instance, I could have numerous Tachyon drives available but not a single Tachyon Source to power it.  This is supposed to provide me with "replayability" but it was thematically unpalatable because how would one ever research Tachyon Drives without the Sources to go with them?   In the end, I would much rather play my 35-year old game of Outreach by SPI.  This is definitely not a good direction for this genre to go.

RATING: 10
Fantastic sci-fi civilization game!! :D A lot of great mechanics, low downtime, intuitive rules and a lot of strategic posibilities and ways to victory :D

This might be a 10 but need to play it more. I've played Decendants of Draco twice and the seem initially to suffer from the fact that the opponent think you have a lot of points in the Acients, but you really don't as the ancients give you only 1 VP and are very easy to destroy later in the game. (a bit like playing Stark in A Game of Thrones. It might seem like you have a lot of land as their areas are big) Maybe it evens out ;)

Eclipse is being mentioned alongside Twilight Imperium and at first glance the look very moch alike BUT in my opininon they are two very different games (which in my opinion is fortunate). Twilight has a more epic feel to it but it takes forever to play. Eclipse takes one third the time and has a lot of different mechanics. Both games might scratch the same itch but we'll se about that too ;)

I love games where the rules are intuitive, well written, fairly easy to grasp and opens up af world of possibilities instead of hampering the game. Eclipse has that as do Earth Reborn. Awesome work by the designers!!

N.B. My game came with a damages player mat for the red faction and one damaged map tile, but the components are very sturdy!

Update October 2012: Upped this to a 10! This is an truely AWESOME game and the fact that it is playable in 3 hours brings it to the table on a week night in our gaming club :)

Feels a lot like TI3, but with half the playtime.  More Eurogame mechanics than TI3 and a simpler rule set.  I did not like that almost all the technologies were ship upgrades - I wish there were more techs that gave rise to non-combat strategies.  Game moves quickly with little downtime, and the overall length is good (4 players, 3.5 hours).  I need to explore this game more...

RATING: 8
Based on app (hard to get a group together). 

So many ways to win or cleverly time key moves to steal victory. Alien races feel very different. I wish someone would play the board game version with me :(

The app itself is good but has no expansions.

Some really tough decisions based around the context of each game. What tech to take? Which route to take? Who to attack? Now or later?

I feel some people who don't like the game don't understand its intricacies. Yes the VP scoring is a bit random but by giving everyone engaged in conflict some VPs it encourages a third or fourth player to get involved. Exploring is random and has an effect on the game but your job is to make the most of it. This would be silly in a two player game but because people work together to ensure the leader won't run away with victory it balances out.

Every turn gives you something to think about. Every turn is meaningful. That's why it's a great game.

Eclipse is the real deal! I was initially intruiged because of its meteoic rise, but I must say, deservedly so!
It has all the best elements of an Ameritrash: the drama, the narrative but combines it with the best elements of a Euro: a clean rule set, victory point based scoring.
Players research technologies, with which they can customize their space ships, with which they explore the galaxy and battle to be the most dominant alien civilization. Meanwhile you have to successfully manage three resouces: money, science and materials.
As a mostly Euro player, my biggest gripe with those overproduced Fantasy Flight Games is their unwieldy ruleset. Yes, there are a lot of exceptions which make thematic sense, but for me, those get in the way of the gameplay. Eclipse has none of that, but still delivers on drama and narrative. 
A big part of the credit has got to go to the graphic design. All the iconography is clear and consise, without need to constantly reference the rulebook. Also, the game does a great job in functionally conveying a complex board state, without compromising on thematic presentation.

RATING: 7
It's not bad, but not sure that it really has blown me away. It does play pretty quickly for an epic space game, but I'm a little concerned about the luck factor of which planets you explore, what discovery tokens you get, and what victory tiles you pull. In addition, it seems that interplayer conflict is typically a late-game opportunistic grab. Still, I need to play with the alien powers and have a few more plays before giving my ultimate decision.

Revised rating from 9 (2011) to 10 (2013).

Wow! WOW! I was impressed with everything about this game from the production values to the rule book to the game play. Similar to Space Empires 4x but much more approachable due to the well thought out player boards that track your progress, the streamlined rules and the interesting action point system. I also prefer the VP victory conditions which gives players more of a choice on how they play. 

This game is an instant classic with a lot of replayability. Two years on and I still whip this game out. Everyone I play with loves it.

I'm so torn on this game. On the one hand I love the resource management, exploration, and powering up my ships. But I hate the combat dice rolls. It is real fun to beat down on some aliens but not as fun to battle friends.

RATING: 5
It's probably good if you're into long, drawn-out 4x games and the resource management aspects are neat, but the components are overly fiddly and you're at the mercy of the randomized tile placement.  If you feel like you need a 4x game with randomized tile placement, try Clash of Cultures or Hyperborea for a less fiddly and easier-to-mitigate randomized tile setup.

An excellent game with a really great graphic design! The player boards, and graphic design in general, are very well done: a lot of information is clearly displayed in a simple, convenient way! 

The game has the space exploration and conquest feel of Twilight Imperium, without all that annoying negotiation and downtime, and without the never-ending game play! The board shows a central hex, with each player's home hexes in surrounding spaces with space between all of these. Players play either humans or an alien race, all with some variations in starting setup. 

On your turn, you can explore, build ships, move ships (3 types + star base per player), research (buy technologies from a display, filled with random tiles each round), upgrade ships (apply some techs) or place/move influence. The more actions you take and the larger your empire, the greater your maintenance costs! Players continue taking turns until everyone passes (and after you pass, you can still take limited actions if necessary!). You earn VP for holding territory, battling, winning battles, researching, and building certain items. After 9 rounds, the player with the most VP wins!

Simply put, this is an excellent game.  I've always been interested in Twilight Imperium but the scale and size of that monster was overwhelming.    Easy to learn, intuitive, multiple paths to victory, exciting, tense and fun.

RATING: 6
This is quite the beast.  I don't think I have ever played a true 4X game before this one and it was only okay.  It's not that much different than a civ game like Sid Meier's Civilization, which I've also played and enjoyed a bit more.

The game is played over 8 rounds, each round you have a number of turns to perform 1 of 6 actions: exploring, shifting influence, researching new technology, upgrading, building, and moving your fleet.  These actions are limited by the amount of your resources in 3 categories: money (used for actions and influencing areas), science (used for researching upgrades), and building materials (I'm sure you can figure this one out).  There are also several different alien species each with special bonuses and handicaps in different areas to even them out.

I wish there were a little more content here, which may be surprising to some.  Despite how much STUFF comes in this game the amount of different stuff isn't all that much.  There really isn't a lot of difference in the tiles you discover; they either have ancients on them or don't and could have ancient discoveries or one of 4 different types of planets (one for each resource and a wildcard).  The technology trees also aren't that varied.  There's pretty much the same stuff on all 3 which is mostly just different upgrades for your ships to use in combat.

There's a lot of decisions to make each round which I like but it also isn't as deep as it would seem.  There is a definite advantage to maximizing your money.  More money means more actions and more tiles you can influence, in every game where I've maxed out my money track I've won, and by a large margin usually.  After all, the more actions you can take and tiles you can influence typically means the more planets you can colonize so with money the other materials come and with most games the player who takes the most actions usually wins.  In this way I certainly think there are certain alien species that are more powerful but I haven't really played enough to make that definite assertion.

This game is also long which would prevent me from really playing it that often even if I really did enjoy it.  The 2 hours listed on BGG is being generous, it perhaps takes just that with 2 players but the amount of set-up and especially tear-down will add another hour to that easily.  You're probably looking at another hour per player you add past 2 and more players makes this game a lot more interesting in my opinion.  So at the recommended 4 I wouldn't be surprised if the game takes 3-4 hours plus an hour set-up/tear-down.  Ouch.

With that in mind, I will probably rarely play this game.  With such a time investment and considering I don't think this game is as deep as that time investment warrants I think I would rather play better games, even though this one is fine.

Rather interesting interconection between growth and expenses, very similar to the Through the Ages system. The tech evolution works pretty well, giving a certain strategic feeling to the game but it also comes out to get dull at some point and this fault is related to the battle mechanism. Players tend to grow militarily speaking and that's all that matters.
Luck plays a major role in the game which penalizes it, IMO.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Summary - As of early Nov this is my Essen pick of the crop, moreover one of the best games I have played in the last three years. The best War/Euro I have ever played, and it stands head and shoulders above Sid Meier's Civlization (a game I love and maybe bears closest comparison with Eclipse), Shogun, Struggle of Empires and Runewars. I am delighted and amazed this is from the designer of my two least favourite games of 2011 (Principato and Walnut Grove)

--------------------------------------------------------

Queued for 25 minutes to get this slice of space shenanigans so I hope it will be worth it. The rules are promising,Ti3 lite, with a few clever looking euro twists in the economic part of the game. The production is pretty fabulous as well

Another touch I like is that the Tech. upgrades come out randomly - it creates a tension as you cant predict exactly where you are going.

------------------------------------------

Call of the search - the grail, a fast paced Space empire 4x game has been found. I absolutely love the mesh of Euro mechanics into a Sci fi space opera game, each turn is quick - there is no hanging around , you need to get out there as fast as possible, VPs available for all battle participants makes combat attractive. The semi random technology availability makes for some confounding difficult and wonderful choices, and there seems to be no one way of winning. All this based on one two player game, i imagine it will be even better with more. 

--------------

2nd full game with 4 - just awesum, all followed slightly different strategies, all seemed viable, though the military route won with Science a close second, turtle/explore third and a mixed approach last.

You cant fix a strategy at the start (with Terrans at least) you need to see what exploration and the techs offers you - every tech choice was difficult with a need to boost economy, bulk up ships and VPs.

The wormhole movement rule prevented the bain of multiplayer war games happening i.e player 3 benefiting from players one and two fighting.

On further reflection I think this more in the tradition of a Civilisation type game than a 4x - its the the theme that leans it to the later comparison.


-----------

Third game - again great with a really different challenge from the outset. Now need to play with races.

----------------

Fourth game won by a player whi build the ulitmate 'battle' cruisers - lethal and fast but one hit and they were dead

------------------

Fifth game I won in a five player cold war - I had the race that produces cheaply and was able to knock out 3 momoliths on the last turn for victory, I should have been attacked

-------------------------------

Sixth game i won with race that has bonus vps for system control. Weird game as low cost techs just did not appear first two rounds - also owner of system centre did not win and from a peaceful universe to turn 5 it went v violent thereafter.

Well tuned space epic that is hampered by a much too large luck factor. Bad exploration especially can hose you brutally and make you a spectator for most of the game, unacceptable at this length. 
Overlong games with a serious luck factor are my most disliked type, and I don't know why BGG embraces them so much. Maybe because you can still win when you play badly?

For a long time I was a fan of TI:3.  I only played it about once every couple years, but I always enjoyed those plays.  What I didn't realize at the time, was how bad of a game it truly is.  After my first play of Eclipse, I changed my rating for TI:3 from an 8 to a 4.  You see I was enjoying those plays despite the rules.  

Eclipse does everything TI:3 does and it does it better in every way.  I still don't know how good Eclipse is, I just know it is twice the game as TI:3 in half the time.

Is something wrong with me? I'm not loving this game that virtually the rest of the world adores. I recognize that it has some extremely clever mechanics, but the strategies for victory seem to boil down to some REALLY basic mechanisms. I really want to play again one more time just to see if I'm missing something, but I'm honestly not looking forward to it.

Also, any game where the strategies focus so heavily on "tactical bankruptcy" seems flawed.

Played a couple turns and just gave up from being too bored.  Would rather play TI3 or Galactic Emperor and that's really saying something.  Just too unbalanced in the hex draws for my taste.  I know it's not necessarily typical, but one guy got 3 Discovery Tiles in his first 3 hex draws that gave him a ship tech and 2 + money resources so he was practically able to maximize his actions on the first turn.  That was another killer.

EDIT: This rating has currently been removed as I recently reacquired the game to give it another shot. A new rating will be forthcoming upon further play.

RATING: 6
Truly excellent, um, "eurotrash" game -- to me it feels a lot like Nexus Ops married to a Caylus or a Hansa Teutonica. There are fleets of mighty plastic ships; there are wooden cubes and a very clever system of progressively more expensive actions.

First impressions are that the luck of various draws can be a killer and that, as has been debated ad nauseam, missiles seem too strong, or at least to distort the rest of the game. It's kind of funny, but the first thing I thought of was David Weber's Honor Harrington series of space operas, where the Star Kingdom of Manticore and the People's Republic of Haven spend several books discovering that whoever can belch out the most thousands of missile pods in any given combat is usually going to win. The same strategy often works here. I'm not at all objecting to the idea that a transformative technology or tactical doctrine can be, well, transformative -- but no other technology (except perhaps wormholes) has the same level of effect on the game, and that I don't like.

This fills the niche in my collection I had hoped would be filled by the likes of Nexus Ops and Small World: an almost perfect light conflict game. That it's not really light at all just goes to show that I should stop buying light games.

-- 

My previous rating reflected what I saw as the game's promise, but that promise has never been realized. Every game I've played I've made some excuse as to why it was less enjoyable than it could or should have been. I'm tired of making excuses. There are many wargames I'd rather play for my conflict fix and many euros I'd rather play for the economic development.

I'm the first to admit that I don't do well with games centered on open conflict, but Eclipse exacerbates the problem by being sufficiently abstracted and euro-fied that it does not feel like a thematic adventure; it feels like a spreadsheet game with capricious random elements added. It's absolutely not a game for me.

Eclipse is a  great game and just a few things tend to bother me a bit:

- game lenght: I think 45 - 60 minutes per player suffices rarely
- amount of luck involved (dices in general, explored tiles, ancient technology, etc.)
- set up time  (+ boxing time)
- in the end it's just a race for the best technology - I'd love some side quests like in Merchants and Marauders or Xia or Tau Ceti
- theme could be a bit more dripping

Great theme play.  Game fairly easy to learn and play.  Many choices during play.  Game play moves along, combat system is simple and does not create down time; however, highly dependent on dice rolls.  Game also very dependent on board draw when exploring - did I draw a rich or poor resource board?  Does the board have ancients to fight?  What is the bonus tile worth? Game has set amount of turns but it seems like your faction just gets developed and then the game ends.  Compnonets excellent - thick cardboard modular board, thick chits, & wood playing pieces.  Well written color rulebook.  Artwork is fair.  Game length is about 2.5 hours which feels short for the game.

{Space civilization; action-point, resource management, dice-rolling, tile placement; optimal 4p}

I am quite concern about the luck of draw during exploration.  It is obvious to me now that with a bad draw, one is screwed and there is no way out as this is a resource management game - nothing you can do without a strong production engine. Yet to see if this is really unbalance.

Really want to like this game, but first turn tile draws can significantly "reward / punish" player for doing absolutly nothing wrong / right.

I must admit I was disappointed after hearing all the hype about this game. Terribly long setup and propensity for players to turtle were big problems.

I am sure I would have liked this game when I was 12. Attacks by your neighbours right away from the start combined with unequal starting positions and the obvious strategy of "turtling" are putting this in the same class as Risk - albeit a Risk with more chrome. Rating 3.7
I cannot believe this is a BGG Top 10 game. 

Update (2017) to 5.7:
Played another game with all Human sides. The starting positions become a little more balanced but luck in early exploration still is quite decisive. 
Still, I generally don't like multi-player combat games.

RATING: 5
The rules weren't nearly as heavy or pointy as I feared they might be, which is a big plus. Oddly, though, the game is a bit TOO euro for me. I'm not usually too big on themes in games, but 4X is an exception. I found myself wishing the game were LESS abstract than it was. If I want a VP-grab experience I'll play a euro. But when I play a 4X I want some real feel of exploration and interstellar combat. So, while Eclipse was kinda fun, it didn't live up to my expectations.

I'll also add that I am NOT a fan of the random VP draws. Rewards should be a little more stable, imo.

RATING: 9
Wow...great game!  I'm impressed by everything about it...the time requirement is manageable, the mechanisms are fun and innovative, the play moves quickly, the rules are remarkably digestible.  I have the same feeling about this game that I had about Through the Ages--i.e., "I can't believe what a great boardgame interpretation of computer game X this is!"

I love the courage of the tech trees being uncertain, so that people can't have planned strategies for their tech progress.  I love the ship blueprints.  I love the movement/combat systems and how they make war difficult even for those with overwhelming force without feeling contrived.

My worries?  Well, I think the game may be best with 4 or 6 just for the symmetry.  I also think that my play group needs to work on less turtling, more fighting.  But generally this is as good a multiplayer wargame/civ game as I've come across.

Nice game with a very good mix of Euro and themed elements. It feels much more like a SciFi game then a normal Euro would.
However, it lacks depth and the space opera feeling it's biggest competitor, TWILIGHT IMPERIUM, offers. On the other hand - ECLIPSE can be played in some 3 hours, which is surely not true for TI3... :-)

First game in, and this looks pretty special. Everything seems to fit together thematically, yet it retains both the tension of a classic euro design, juxtaposed against the old fashioned combat risks associated with the die rolls. Ship building is clever, and simple. Map layout is interesting and provides replayability, as does the variable limited tech path. Upkeep is well designed, and is simple to manage. What the game may be at risk of though is an optimal strategy, but time will tell. For now, an excellent game.

This game is probably too long and has too many rules for the experience you're going to get. In the end, you're just going to upgrade your ship and attack other ships and roll a bunch of dice. That's fun sometimes, but it still just feels like another war game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I like most of it. But those missiles that fire before anything else seem overpowered and it's one of those games where at the end, when we find out who won, everyone goes 'really? wow. didn't see that coming.' which can be irritating. But i love the euro style resource management that gets trickier as you expand and stretch yourself. would play it again.

***

edit: Ok, now I don't like the combat. It feels like you can spend two hours building your empire, carefully allocating your resources and researching techs (assuming the ones you need come out the bag) and then in the end it comes down to a couple of dice rolls. It just feels like a combat mechanic from a different, less good game. Eclipse irritates me more every time I play it.

Amazingly great game. It is like Twilight Imperium 3, but in half the time. Unfortunately, the game is still prone to a little too much luck and variance than I'd prefer. Also, I wish there was a little bit MORE to the game, as it is very combat oriented and can become a dice fest.

Hopefully, the expansion(s) will fix these problems, and I see this game making it easily into the top 10, if not the top 5.

EDIT: After repeated plays, the game still holds up, but lacks some of the interesting surprise mechanisms that I enjoy (like secret action cards or some type of hidden information). This doesn't hurt the game much, but decreases my rating from a 9 to a 8.75, and maybe an 8.5 depending on how I feel after a few more plays. Bumped it back up to a 9 because of how different the alien factions feel. Definitely changes the game and adds a lot more replayability.

Need to try playing with "draw 2; keep 1" for tiles when exploring. Right now there's a ton of variance that is only exaggerated with the expansions.

EDIT 2: Dropped down to an 8.5 due to how much variance there can be in the game that just screws someone over early and compounds throughout the whole game. Still a great game, but can feel like an impossible battle with luck sometimes.

Space econo-war game. More economy control than anything else though. I love it! However, I think it is too short. By the time everyone is flying around with big guns, the game ends (which is how it is supposed to be for some races).

I would really like to try playing a total-domination session of this once with some modified rules.

My games of eclipse have been some of the most engaging, frustrating, and exciting plays of my entire 11 year board gaming life. This game is truly an epic experience, and everyone owes it to themselves to give it a try. Unfortunately, though, it has been years since I've played the game. I even traded away my copy because my normal gaming partners were not interested in playing such a long game. It's really a shame, and I've been thinking that I need to get a play in of this again soon if I can talk a friend who has it into setting up a game. Still - an amazing space 4x game, and well deserving of its place in BGGs top 100 - it just doesn't get played much as far as I can tell.

This is an awesome game. I just want to play it all the time but hardly get the chance. It's just so slick. I recently played Through the Ages face-to-face (as opposed to through BGO) and was struck at how you get a lot of the same game out of Eclipse but with much less twiddling overhead.

The randomness makes this game rough on some folks -- both the tiles and the dice can screw you pretty bad. I've been on the receiving end once or twice but it doesn't bug me as much as others.

Great but not great. Long game. Game mechanics are slightly lopsided. Long setup time. Lots of pieces.

But it is a very imaginative and interesting scenario universe.  The art work is decent and the backstory is intriguing. Game play is similar to Terra Mystica, but without the balance and with an interstellar theme.

I enjoy the game but I think I could make some correction to it as well.

A little too random to be a good eurogame. A little do dry to be a good ameritrash game. The strength of effect of direct combat is a little too strong for a game where you spend the majority of time on resource management. IMHO, this hybrid didn't quite find it's niche.

Brilliant design makes what could easily a complicated economic/research and empire control system play very smoothly. Upgrading and customizing your ships is awesome. Combat is a bit lacking; adding up initiative number is a pain, and it can be a lot of rolling and waiting to get high numbers.

Based upon only two plays. Races seem surprisingly diverse, which is nice. The game has a lot of rules but they fit well together; once you learn the basics, you won't need to consult the rulebook very often.

You get to explore a galaxy, customize your own ships, and research from a wide variety of (randomized each game) technology. Good fun but start early in the evening.

RATING: 8
Hybrid space conquest game with many innovative features. The premise is a tried and tested one, where players have to explore and conquer different systems thereby increasing the resources available to them, which are needed to increase fleet size and develop technologies. So far, so 'Twilight Imperium'. Where this game differs so much from its predecessors is that at its heart its a Euro resource-management game with a fixed number of turns. The three resource tracks, which allow players to increase their number of actions, develop more technologies, and increase the size of their fleet, is an incredibly well-designed mechanism, very Euro in its style, and certainly makes 'Eclipse' stand out from similar games. The fact that you know when the game will end due to the set turn number means that players are forced to be pro-active in their strategies. You are forced into going onto the front foot and there's no point players sitting there spending and age developing a huge fleet in the hope of a slow and attritional game. The game doesn't quite have the epic scope of some other similarly themed games, but its mechanisms are certainly something to be commended and its manageable play length means that it stands out.

Pretty solid affair, rating a bit lower only due to the length. Normally not a fan of space themed board games, but I do like that this one has a focus on exploration, and hence the universe is not contained within a board per say.

Have played 20+ times. Own RotA and SotR expansion (and can fit everything in the base box). This is my favorite heavy game. Even better with larger player counts.

For people trying to cut down play time:
- Use the dual action tokens that came in the RotA expansion. This allows 2 players to take actions at once. Plus it makes the game feel like a real time strategy vs turn based strategy as the board is always changing.
- Organize the ship parts in a Plano box ($3.99 at amazon). When someone takes the upgrade action, pass them the box and the next person can start their action. 
- Resolve two combat hexes at the same time. Have two people who know the combat mechanisms and have combat performed in parallel, unless they could effect each other.
- Bag the discovery tiles and draw them randomly from the bag. No need to have a stack on the table to draw from.

1. Humans: Initial game at Samolot rooms, Samolot won by 1 or 2 points.
2. Humans: Again with Samolot, bad luck with fighting (2 or 3 times, as later calculated, the chance for such a bad luck was about 1%), lost a tie to Samolot.
3. Humans: also with Samolot, quickly conquered the Samolot homeworld, but later, after big battle in the center eaten by everybody (having nearly no ships), Blaszczu won.
4. Mechanema: Dreadnaught with +4 computers unfortunately lost to an ancient ship, slow development, nearly no materials, Maciek won.
5. Orion: Blocked and limited to 3 sectors, game at Tomek house, Maciek won having both supernovas.

Wanted to love it but either my expectations or peoples praises were wrong.
It's a beautiful designed game that keeps people engaged but I feel nothing when I play it.  There's no real tension, no trade, no negotiation. It's also a pain to setup and take down and requires huge amounts of table space. The rulebook while comprehensive and clear makes it horribly difficult to find the answer you're looking for.

If you want a euro with combat then this is it but if you want story, character, player interaction and fun, then look elsewhere.

Hmmm. We played for hours, nothing wrong with that, but in the end, it was over really quick. Can't articualte my first impressions, which are from several months ago. It felt like a eurogame in disguise. That's how I would describe it and that is exactly why I don't really like the game.

Solid game. There's a good deal of randomness, but it's made quite manageable and there are a number of viable strategies that can be followed. My only major gripe is with the missiles technology which can be really overpowered. This is made worse by the random selection of technologies as only one or two might come up over the course of a game and those two players can abuse the strategy without much interference.

This was my #1 top rated game. Title passed to Fief 1429 lately.

[UPDATE MAR 2015] Re-rated this game by 0.5 point downwards after a 5p game which was a ho-hum experience. This had to do with setup: we erroneously mixed in two Supernova expansions in our tileset, and of course all 4 supernovas got drawn which really screwed up the economics. Also, I was situated with the Exiles (turtle race) between a relatively unexperienced player (Terran) and a compulsive turtling player (Hydrans) so I actually could afford to focus all my military on the tile next to the GDC to deter the militaristic players (who had formed an alliance on the other side of the map) to come visit.

And just wait it out and win by a large, large margin (my 48 vs 34 second place).. I actually thought about spicing the game up by outfitting my interceptors with larger engines and make good use of my cloacking to send them into the backfield of some players, but the Hydran player snatched Neutron Bombs to get some tech points so I decided to drop that plan and just play for the points. As no one came to visit, that resulted in a quite boring game.

Excellent game, an original mix of eurogaming and ameritrash. A good balance between long-term and short-term strategies with just enough of tactics. The only problem for me is the fact that you can loose a game if you have a badluck on your first three turns. Maybe a little bit too much luck to have more than 8/10 in my humble opinion.

I love this game to no end.  It's got a great balance of paths to victory, and the randomness of galaxy tiles and research tiles makes it so every game you have to adapt your strategy.  The aliens each have some fun things about them that makes me want to play them, and on the flip side the humans are a very solid race as well.  This is nice since I don't get bored while explaining the rules because when I'm teaching new people I prefer to keep it simple, so by not taking different actions than they are or paying different costs it helps me to explain by example.  It's fun with 2 people all the way through 6 people, and based on the number of people the strategies also vary wildly.

Seriously buy this game

It does a lot of good things; all of the good things from TI3, but with 2-9 hours less time time invested. I like the exploration (and I'm inclined to agree that it balances out fairly well overall), the the tech-trees are simple enough, the various options seem well balanced and well thought out.

My main gripes are that the honour tokens for taking part in (or winning) a battle are random and hidden, the techs all do too many of the same things (if 1 gives you increased chance to hit and one reduces the chance to hit, they are largely pointless, if one gives you a second die to roll and one doubles the damage one die does, they are *basically* the same). It seems a lot like there are choices for the sake of choice, when in practice, the differences between any two or three is tiny.

Finally, combat can be tedious when it requires an average of 36 die rolls to resolve (using a couple of poorly equipped guns).

Yes, all of these are avoidable, but they detract from an otherwise very promising game.

Eclipse works brilliantly and all the information you need is on the board and in the hexes. Quality of the pieces is good and the rulebook is understandable and well written. The time needed to play one game through is enough to make it feel epic and short enough to not feel like your dragging through it.

There is some luck but it's very manageable with the right choices. All the details and intuitive play just makes this game one of my favorites.

One of the best 4X implementations with nice interlocking game mechanics.  Some slight balancing issues but we enjoy the variety of the different races, the way that the game rewards you for combat (i.e. pure turtle strategies don't usually win), and how the game time is short, even if it does not look like it at the start of the game (i.e. no resting on your laurels!)

I love Eclipse's theme so much that even dice don't bother me. That is really saying something. Space and spaceships, what's not to love?

I love planning my tech trees and especially equipting my spaceships. I seem to like games where I can pick something up from a common pool (same thing in for example Puerto Rico with all the buildings).

Dice in combat don't bother me so much in Eclipse as in many other games for two reasons. 1. It's space battle. It would be stupid if you could mathematically calculate the outcome before it even begins. Thematically very accurate that surprises happen. And 2. you can mitigate your luck with different ship parts and of course having lots more spaceships than your opponent.

After five plays, my game group has gotten the play time for Eclipse down to 1 hour per player. Unfortunately, this is well into the territory where an afternoon or evening has to be dedicated to playing if we want four or more players involved. Maybe I will hold this in higher esteem if we can get it down to 40-50 minutes per player. As it is, I feel like Eclipse will come out once in a while, but most of the time I'd rather play two or three shorter games of similar quality instead.

I enjoyed this 4x game. I'm not sure I enjoyed it enough to want to play 6 players or more, but for what's here, it was decent enough fun.

**Update: This is a good 4x game, but it is a bit long and all the bits (esp with expansions) make it a little bit of a pain to get to the table for me. Playing with 4 or more players would probably only be something I'd do at a con - maybe.

Very promising game just by reading the rules. Surprisingly simple considering the amount of pages in the rules and of the components. 

The only two things bothering me are the space battles which in the worst case may turn out to be a long series of dice-throws especially in the early game - in the later game there should be so much dice-modifiers that battles are quickly resolved. The other thing is a question about possible player-elimination but that would probably be the result of a poor play. 

I'm eager to test it.

Great game that is easy enough to be able to include board game muggles in your session. They will be baffled by the rules explanation at first but once they start playing, my experience is that understanding comes quickly.

This game was described to me as "Ameritrash for Eurogamers." That's a good description, but a better one would be that it's a Euro that slowly adds in Ameritrash elements. It's easy to see why this game is so popular: it's a game of economic management that's hiding behind a space 4x theme, which is perfect for people that don't want to invest the time in a true 4x game. I just wonder if something else might be better for my collection.

I enjoyed my first playing of Eclipse. Need to play this a few more times to see where my rating finally shakes out, but I could see it rising or falling at this point. I love the depth of the game and the tech track and exploration mechanics are pretty cool. I'm guessing picking up points early with small battles is key, but time will tell. Definitely interested in trying out new strategies - the game seems very open-ended in terms of how you go about your business - but a little concerned about the huge time investment this one demands. Definitely intrigued at this point, though!

A decent space exploration/resource management game,

a criticism, it's that the random elements are too
intrusive, particularly when it comes to combat and
getting lucky with exploring hexes.

I really like this game.  4x yada yada yada.  It looks epic.  It plays great, although definitely more like a  Euro which can lead to less player interaction/battles.  Twilight Imperium 1 does a far better job of pulling the player interaction/politics together.

A lot of variance/randomness factors throughout the game which can really build up against somebody at times. I have a buddy who doesn't mind that in a shorter game, but in a longer game it makes this a little tougher to take.  A more seasoned player will be able to maximize the situation, but being a longer game it can be frustrating to not feel like you have a great chance to win.

I would like to try adding some sort of political/action deck a la TI to this.  The set number of turns makes play time shorter and so this sort of function wouldn't overly extend this.

Eclipse takes [i]Twilight Imperium 3[/i] and replaces its heavy influence of [i]Puerto Rico[/i] with [i]Through the Ages[/i].  It also cuts out all of TI3's fat, making for a quicker, stream-lined 4X.  I guess I can see why some people think Eclipse is a TI3 killer -- especially people who weren't fans of TI3 to begin with -- but it's not that for me.  I like Eclipse's leanness, but I also like TI3's fat.  (Like with meat, the fat is often where you find the flavour.)

RATING: 7
Here's the very prototype of a preliminary rating as the rating rather reflects what I think this game will settle down at or what I want it to be, because in all honesty the 2-player-session I played was rather a 6.5 or a 7.0, but then again this game isn't meant for 2players. I am intrigued by the tech "trees" and the customizable ship types, I am intrigued by the rules for the diplomacy in a game with more players, I am intrigued that someone who doesn't stand to his word gets to be penalized with the traitor card and might have to stick with it until the end of the game, I am intrigued with the possibility of still reacting to a game situation even after having passed and I love how they considered that these actions would of course be weaker than the regular action and I definitely like the combat system. There's so much in here, but in this 2p-session my coplayer fell behind and - he was right in that -there was no way for him to catch up or no mechanics that would compensate - in a game with 3 or more players other coplayers would have targeted the leader, i.e. me, but with 2 players that gets kind of hard. So, here's my advice: However much you yearn to try this game, don't play it with 2. 
Kudos to the design team. They created something that is paradox at first glance when really it isn't: It's an epic game on a "small scale". That said it doesn't quite achieve the space opera feeling that TI 3rd edition evokes,but it comes close and it exceeds contenders like Phantom League by far. 
--------------------------------------------------
Update: Woah, that was a disappointment. With 5 players this game comes close to the same game length as TI 3rd edition. And setting up really takes loooooooooong! Unfortunately our session suffered from the same cons as TI3 and adds heavy new ones. Sharing the negatives:
- cold war conduct (building up fleets, trying to intimidate opponents and only at the very end battles occur)
- very dependent on luck of the roll (Seeing everything you build up in hours fall to pieces within a few seconds of outrageously bad die rolls sucks)

Cons it adds on top:
- very dependent on luck of the draw (when it comes to reputation tiles from battle)
- Missilegeddon makes a huge impact on the game (Hopefully this is fixed with the expansion)
- even more downtime than in TI3. At least there you can make use of the secondary ability when it's other player's turn. There's nothing you can do except wait for your turn again in Eclipse. 

Really, this game is not the No.1 4x game the BGG ranking would make believe. I stil love the ship type configuration and the resource management, but still I expected this game to shine. Which it didn't! People claim, it achieves things TI3 doesn't, when in fact it's not an improvement in regards to its reference. Will probably have to wait for quite some time before this one hits the table again! Maybe I'm so pissed off at this game, because I knew we could have fit a session of Clash of Cultures and Tzolk'in in it. And I saw that most of the group didn't have a good time playing.   
---------------------------------------------------
Another 4-player session with the expansion and I have to say that the expansion definitely expands the game in terms of playability and fun.

Man, this game is so damn fun. There's just so much randomness, strategic depth, and options involved with each turn you take, and your race changes it up so much... gathering resources, discovering ancient artifacts, developing new tech, upgrading you ship designs, printing more military... there are so many things you can do in this game, so many ways to win, it's just super cool.
But...
Oh dear sweet lord, this game is such a time investment. Seriously, don't bother without 4 hours. Worse, over an hour of that is likely setup and tear down. Organize the bits as much or as wisely as you want, it still takes forever. Likewise, it isn't just getting the free time together, if it isn't your turn, you are extremely univolved. This means other players turns don't involve you one iota typically (MAYBE some diplomacy or a combat happen... not more often than not). So you won't be participating in at least half this game, for two play... 1/3 for three, 1/4 for four, etc... and while you could argue that's normal, when turns can take 10+ minutes, its a real damn issue. I found myself pulling out my iphone... which is not something you should do during a board game, an activity meant to be social. 
Sadly, even making it an AP didn't help... while faster than a human, even the AI takes awhile with turns. I makes it hard to recommend it, crazy as it sounds for how fun it is when you're actually playing.
Sadly, you spend little time while playing Eclipse actually PLAYING.

A great game, some major elements missing for me though (politics, any deep trading etc) and some IMO broken tech and randomness lowers the score for me personally.

Lots of fun. Upgrading your ships is lots of fun on its own, but there's also different factions that all play differently, exploring, and war (or trying to avoid war).

Update: Increasing my rating after playing with the expansion. The expansion makes the two player game more interesting by adding some ancient homeworlds to go after, and some warp portals that can make it easier to move across the board if you want encounter the other player more often. Also, the game is just a good euro that has some combat and lots of theme.

Update again: I've heard this complaint, but I've finally seen for myself one big flaw of the game: drawing the blind combat tiles is a huge random element. If a combat-heavy player draws poorly, he can easily lose the game based on pure luck of the draw. The randomness of the technology tiles can also be an issue. I've seen games where no power sources came out, except for one, for almost the whole game and the player who got that one upgraded power source won easily. That upgraded power source allowed him to get the other great technology tiles that came out, while the other players didn't have enough power to get upgraded tiles. Some sort of variant to correct the combat tile draw and the technology draws would be needed if I play again.

I still like the game overall, but between these flaws and some people I play with not liking the game, I got rid of it.

Sold.

RATING: 5
Really dragged on for our group. I bet if we all knew the game it would be much more enjoyable. My biggest problems here are the rampant dice rolling and how the end of the game can just be a useless dogfight, with basically eliminated players just watching. This is exacerbated by the fact that the rounds get LONGER as the game goes on. I like the theme and the non-dice-rolling mechanics though. Exploration is really cool, and done way better than other games with similar mechanics (BaHotH comes to mind).

RATING: 4.5
I'm very excited to get this one to the table.

::UPDATE::

I got it to the table and I was disappointed. I recently traded it away. Here are my issues:

1. Luck-riddled exploration ruins the game from the start. The first half of the game isn't about planning any kind of long-term strategy. It's about exploring and hoping ([i]oh please let me get a good tile, please![/i]) you uncover a useful tile. If not, bummer. Oh well, I have a couple more turns to try. The decisions are boring in the beginning.

2. Lucky draws for victory. So a player goes to battle a couple times early and draws the high-point tiles. Game over. It's boring for everybody involved because you can tell by the smug look on that player's face what he's got. Secondly, it's boring for him too. He's going to win and he knows it. All he has to do is play out a mediocre game for the next few hours. Which brings me to the last point.

3. Too long for what it delivers. I can play a game of Puerto Rico with five players in 90 minutes. In that 90 minutes, I will make uncountably more interesting decisions than I will a 6-hour session of Eclipse. There just aren't very many interesting decisions in this game. It all seems like aimless decisions: [i]"Well, I did some exploring and got some tiles that were okay--I wish I would have been as lucky as Bill over there, his tiles turned out to be awesome!--I guess I'll start seeing about upgrading my ships a little...I guess."[/i]

This game has received unbelievable praise. I just don't get it. I want to make interesting, difficult decisions. When I play Eclipse, I feel like I'm on autopilot.

::UPDATE::

10/4/2013 - After creating [geeklist=163260][b]this GeekList[/b][/geeklist] and putting Eclipse as my most-overrated game, a friendly Geek pointed out to me that according to my own definition of overrated, it was in fact not my overrated unless I lowered it a whole point. So, I now rate it 4.5. Most overrated game I know. :b

RATING: 6
I'm torn on this game. I think the design is really, really clever. There's a ton of interesting choices. There's quite a bit of luck in dice rolls and exploration, but with careful planning and other players keeping any runaway leader in check, I think the game is sufficiently balanced. (An exception may be the point-shields from battles. It's inten seems to be to both reward conflict and compensate losing in those conflicts, but the result can be give a huge swath of points to someone who is unlucky in battle but lucky in shield draws, making this particular game element not particularly thematic.).

However, this is a long game to explain and play. If there's any semi-serious analysis-paralysis at the table, this can be a pure grind.

It could have been done much worse, which is why I didn't give it a 1. That said, it could have been designed much better. All of these play mechanics could have been achieved with a much more intuitive set of components... But as it is, the board, the pieces and the tiles all work against the player trying to understand what's going on in the middle of it. Okay game mechanics, poor design implementation.

RATING: 3
Plays: 1.

I was dead-set against liking Eclipse before I actually played it, but because I was in the minority opinion of our group of four, I put my most optimistic foot forward and kept an open mind so I wouldn't seem like a jerk.

I was pleasantly surprised by how easy the turn-to-turn gameplay was. When you first see all the pieces and numbers, it seems fiercely complex, but really when you get into the swing of things it's fine.

I enjoyed the resource gathering a lot; very elegant in its design. Building and moving ships was also cool. However, the methods by which you purchase and apply tech is needlessly complicated. And unbalanced: if you get the right piece of random tech from a defeated alien, you can pull far ahead of your opponents early on.

Also, while the game seems very open and full of options, it actually becomes incredibly restrictive at the end. If you get locked in with tiles that won't allow you to expand further (and thereby kill aliens, the only way you'll really win), you'll be forced to start taking your opponents' territory. And if some of your opponents are far too powerful, you may be forced to take out your trading ally, and therefore take a penalty to your victory points.

The theme could also use some work, but I guess that's common for these types of games. I admit I don't understand Eclipse's popularity, and it's not terrible, but I don't think I'll voluntarily play it again.

This game has basically fired Twilight Imperium, in my mind.  Problem might just be that I'm not a huge fan of 4X space empire games.

After playing this a few more times, years after its release it has grown on me a bit.

It's a nicely designed very euro'y 4X game.  The way you get to design your ships and add new techs is quite cool.  The economic balancing act of "can I afford to do another action?", "do I forfeit control of this sector to save cash?" is a really interesting mechanic that more games should use.  

My only issues with the game are the very large luck of the draw map setup.  Due mainly to luck you can be surrounded by open space or ancients while your opponent is drowning in resource rich planets.  While it's not impossible to overcome, it isn't easy to come back from that since the game does involve a technological snowball effect.  You go from having slow, ships that hit on a 6 and have the defense of a Ford Pinto to having a full blown Doomsday Device that is virtually indestructible, so if you get behind the 8-ball you will probably stay there....for 2 hours.

The scoring might be one of my favorite parts of this game because the temptation to have the biggest most frightening army is so great, but also isn't the easiest way to get points.  Long term planning and not losing focus on points generally pays off, but the game will constantly tempt you with a bigger laser at the expense of 2 points!  Just do it!  Look at how big it is!

All in all it's a fun game, and quicker than most other 4X games, it gives you the full experience in 2 hours -- albeit with the potential for a hard luck game or two.

Enjoy the game, but... feels off somehow. part of it might be the insane ammount of setup time this game takes. I have updated my storage options  which help i think but this game is still cluttery. Would love to invest in one of the organizers available online, and have more people to play it with. (only ever played 2 player really).

RATING: 6
This underwhelmed me compared to the hype. It's not by any means bad. It's just that it's simply not 'as good' at any of the things it does as a handful of other games in any category, and the sum total of it's parts isn't impressive enough to me.

If I want to play ship customization, I'll play Galaxy Trucker.

If I want to play diplomacy/player interaction, I'll play Republic of Rome, Twilight Imperium 3rd.

If I want to play space combat, I'll play Space Empires 4x or Twilight Imperium 3rd (or any of a longer list for just better combat in general).

If I want to farm victory points, I'll play just about any euro on the shelf.

I have never found myself wanting to do *all* of those things at once, and when I get even close to it Twilight Imperium 3 does it better for me, in a similar play time with an experienced group of players (which I fortunately have available readily)

RATING: 7
I largely acquired this game as a comparison to my own space-epic game that I've been designing (really, what nerd isn't?).  It's fine and has some fun properties, but as far as I can see, doesn't really do much to solve the classic problems of area-control games (e.g. A and B fight so C wins), or to parallelize turns to cut down on play time and downtime with large numbers of players.

RATING: 9
Epic space opera experience. 

The game has tension, variety, replayability, tough decisions, tough diplomacy, an excellent pace and of course an excellent theme. The eloquent (simple yet very deep) mechanics are excellent, and the action/cost system along with the technology system are the highlights. The optional alien races are also excellent and appear to be both balanced and very different. Battles are tense and not mathy, with the blueprint system being unbelievably effective. The pace of the game also deserves a special note, as what starts as an exploration game gradually evolves into a race for the center and then an epic showout. The flow is also great, as half an hour per player for such an experience is an amazing trade.

Exploration appears a simple part of the game, but is actually by far the most complicated. Reacting to your exploration results (what systens to keep/discard, when to go for the ancients and at what odds, what economic tech to go for, what to explore and in what order so as not to be blocked, what systems to immediately colonise/colonise and then abandon/colonise later etc) is half the game. This is great for veterans as it creates a very fluid and balanced replayability but not so good for new players who can easily mis-react to their exploration and be out of the game from early on. The most major problem for the game is than an early battle loss can be crippling, and although players can and should mitigate this with technology, there will still be the odd early battle from time to time where a player will lose even with 95% chances to win -  and there is no way back from that. Everything I note here as a disadvantage, is a very minor issue for me, both because it doesn't affect experienced play at any important degree, and because I don't know or can think of game that can make exploration&combat better than Eclipse.

All in all, it is an excellent game, that also hits a sweetspot in my preferences, and thus I cannot think of myself ever denying to play this.

RATING: 3
I very much enjoy the mechanics and the components are nice; however, the potential of the game is not usually realized.  You would think there are a lot of options, but you would be wrong.  There is really only one way to the play the game and you must still rely heavily on luck.  Lastly, the game takes an extraordinary amount of time to play, meaning you could play at least two other more enjoyable titles in that time.

What I like: 

-Despite being a complex game, it is extremely intuitive to learn and the main board and race board just make sense. 
-Many different strategies, unique races, lots of variation between plays. 

What I dislike: 

-No matter what, I just don't like games where the outcome is determined by who attacks who. This game does a lot to deal with that, but it's still there. 
-I do not like the visuals. Especially the races look really poorly drawn
-Game time could have been a bit shorter.

This is a elegant, compelling board game. It masterfully captured a streamlined experience of the "4X" computer game. However, at times while playing this game, adding up income and manipulating physical tiles, I'll ask myself, "why aren't we just playing a computer game like Civ 5?"

For a non-Ameritrash fan like me, I enjoyed this quite a bit. Yes there is dice rolling to resolve combat, but there are ways to mitigate the luck, and combat is not all there is to the game. The design is a well polished combination of exploration, colonization, technology advancement, and conquest. Everything is presented in an intuitive, user-friendly way so as to make the journey up the learning curve easier than the size of the rule book would indicate. Setup/packup time is high due to the myriad of pieces.

One of the best games I have in my collection. It combines Euro and Ameritrash mechanics in such a way that can simply play either way. Focus on technologies and resource management and you have a Euro game, focus on ship combat and exploration, you have Ameritrash. Great game that I think many will enjoy. I do have subtle yet sometimes significant complaints. Often I find the setup is rather long and the exploration tiles have a bit of a hosing factor to them. These are, as I said, minor complaints that don't bother me nearly as much as they might bother other players, but I still see the problem. All in all, a great game that will see many more plays to come!

Space civilization game in 3 hours! What more can you ask. Great mechanics! This game has probably the best iconography for a complex game.

This fixes a typical otherwise tedious mechanism in other civilization games.

Great space exploration game that reminds me a lot of the Master of Orion video game series.

Great mechanics for dealing with exploration, research, and overall empire management.  The system is solid without being too much, but allows for tons of strategy.

A little bit too much on the Ameritrash side for me.  I'm not in love with wargames/direct conflict games... but even so I liked this.  The exploration/tech research and action mechanic are pretty great.  But random exploration tile draws, dice in fights, random vp tile draws, random ancient artifacts, and random techs being available at the right time all make luck a huge factor in this game.

A really good 4x. The gameplay is well made, and the player board is a thing of genious, and helps the game flow like none I have seen.

Eclipse have a luck element - you roll dice, explore hidden tiles (with some being much batter than others) and even can be in the same path as someone else. But I think that one can navigate around these situations (with some off-game dynamics).

This game has some really elegant features. The ship blueprints and the economy system. It's replaced TI3 because of its simplicity and shorter play time.

An extremely layered and satisfying space 4X game.  Every part of this game, including exploration, building ships, researching technologies, upgrading ship parts, expanding empires, and combat, all mesh together perfectly.  The mechanic where influence disks indicate how many actions you have available as well as the size of your empire is brilliant and thematically correct.  The whole game feels clean and just makes sense, there aren't any annoying rules that aren't streamlined which is saying a lot for a game of this size.  The rules are easy to understand after only one play, and the luck in the game is easily mitigated with strategic play.  It is also beautiful and impressive when it is laid out on the table.  This is an economic game at its core, it is all about using the resources you have to the best of their ability.  It just so happens that some of those abilities include making meaningful alliances, developing advanced ship fleets, and clashing those ship fleets against your enemies, which is awesome.  Fantastic.

Only one half-played 2p game so far, but we liked it very much. The resource management felt more euro than I thought. And the planning of what actions I should take felt a bit like Agricola. But we had to stop before the real fighting started, but it seemed very promising.

Updated (9.5): Finally got a 4p game on this. Loved it. Fighting was fun. Exploring and researching technology was exciting. And resource management didn't feel "worker placement" this time, although very challenging and streamlined.

This game is great.  It really has great mechanics, from modifying the ships, to acquiring and researching technologies to exploring space.  I have played it the way I am supposed to with ending on certain rounds, and I have played it out for a 'total domination' game where we completely eliminate to other player.  I have found that playing and ending on the round 9 fits better for our players.

Only played once, but can't wait for more plays!  I really like the ability to use technology to customize your ships.  Unfortunately I spent way too much time getting awesome ships that I only used on the last turn of the game while the winner just went for victory points.  I like Galactic Emperor and TI3, but feel this game is different enough (even if using the same ships) that I could play any of them!

Have placed more over the years and really like the game.  Don't play face-to-face much since I can play so much faster on the iPad.  However, really like the human interaction of regular plays vs the AI on iPad.

I think this game is pretty much perfect for what it's trying to do. A very well put together civilization building game and many viable paths to victory.

In my opinion, a better implementation of what Twilight Imperium was trying to accomplish. Rules are much more streamlined and it doesn't take all day to play.

The only downside/gripe is that it takes a long time to explain the rules and can be daunting for first time players.

The physical systems design is very good, and the game design does a lot of things right. However, the game still has the same problems a lot of similar games do.

Being the first person to be attacked successfully will also leave you in a hole you probably can't get out of.

Eclipse is almost everything I hoped (and expected) it to be. An interesting combination of euro-style resource management and ameritrash space battles with streamlined player turns and a strong theme. And it lets you  configure your own spaceships! Love the fact that, for such an epic game, the rules are intuitive and easy to comprehend, downtime is minimal and playing time very acceptable (although is still a pretty long game). Components are great, except for the standard spaceships. Depending on the tiles you draw when exploring, it might start a little slow though. And it doesn't really keep you on the edge of your seat most of the turns. Still, it is a very enjoyable game, and the only epic space opera game I need in my collection.
UPDATE: Lowered my rating to a 7. It seems that in every game so far we had a player who was denied victory due to some unlucky tile draws at the beginning of the game. A big drawback as far as I am concerned.

The only gripe I have with this game, is convincing other people that it's worth it to play a game that takes this long.  Also introducing new people to it can seem daunting due to the amount of rules it takes up front to go through a turn, once a turn is seen in action, it goes more smoothly, but put both of those issues together, and it is quite hard to convince people to give the game a chance.

I've played it a handful of times in person and several on the iPad. Still enjoy it and think it is a great game. It is still beholden to some crazy random discoveries and you need the expansion to deal with the missiles strategy but the game is really quite fun to play.

*******************

Rating after one play. Yes, it is TI-lite. What isn't when it comes to 4x space games? The goods - resource management is fun and easier to track, technology 'tree' isn't so much a tree as a discount affair. Very cool. Ship upgrades are cooler and easier to track. Set end game changes strategies and keeps play time down. The Cons? The game felt like it ended right when we had our armadas ready to battle. Ship upgrades can be silly imbalanced by a random treasure find (+3 Computer, yes, I'm looking at you!). Over all I like it and would gladly give it another go.

My favorite 4x game...love the Economy and ship customization.  It's definitely a dice-chucker, but there are plenty of ways to mitigate that randomness.  

Love the exploration...and Universe-building aspect of the game.  

Favorite player count is 4.  6 is a much more congested board...which is great, but the amount of downtime and game length really pushes me back to the 4player gaem.  

Playtime is understated on the box.... 3.5-4hours is a reasonable expectation for gamelength.

Need a few more plays to see if this warrants all of the hype. I am unconvinced that this is the Twilight Imperium killer.  WEAK diplomacy mechanism.  I think the hype on this one will cool off over time.  There are folks on the geek that are already calling this one repetitive after several plays. Current Rating: 7.5

Second Play: Really enjoyed it.  Went a bit long with 6 players (6 hours!) but we were still noobs to the rules.  I wish the comparisons to Twilight Imperium would end, these are totally different games. TI scratches a completely different itch for me.  I'm bumping my rating to an 8 and that is probably where it will stay.

One of the best games I've ever played. It has clever mechanics to keep the eurogamers happy and loads of dice to satisfy the ameritrash crowd.

I love the tense buildup of warfare for the climactic end of the game. Luck has its place, but no single die roll will ever decide your fate. By the end of the game players are rolling so many dice at once battles are virtually decided beforehand simply on averages alone.

While most of the mechanics are fairly mundane the game is so well polished that the whole becomes larger than the sum of its parts.

On the short list of the best space-themed games out there.  It manages to distinguish itself from a crowded genre with amazingly tight actions and resources, along with extreme granularity in ship building.  The influence system is ingenious, and this game expertly toes the line of just enough detail without being confusing.

The inevitable comparison is to [gameid=12493].  They're both long space operas with races fighting over a hex-based map.  This clocks in at about 2/3 the length, but you don't quite have the same distinguishing races and player powers, or quite the same epic feel.  This game is focused on small skirmishes, while TI3 is about sweeping offensives.  You probably don't need to own both. My preference is for TI3, but there's a valid argument to owning this one instead.

One three player game so far, the one guy who had played before more or less demolished others in the end game. It took four hours to play, but hopefully it gets shorter, when everyone has more experience. Much of stuff on the board, lots of tiles and cubes and so on. In the end it is not that complicated (at least it feels like that), because the options to make are not that many. Looks like an ok game and theme is good. Let's see after couple of games how it feels then.

Add one three player game more and the game still feels good, but you need to play it more to know the game better and be able to play faster. If I play this more in the future and games take shorter time, then most likely the rating will go up.

Updated after two more games, they were faster now - even with the expansion and the game is good. It takes quite a lot to setup, which is not nice, but in the end all the mechanics are quite simple. Upgraded the rating from 7 to 8.

Fifth play, four players and with the expansion. Good game, but it was a year from the previous one, so I didn't play very well.

Sixth play after one year, this time with more expansions. We were too tired and some were too drunk, so the play was way too long. The game is still good.

7th and 8th play were in a group of three, one was newbie and another had one play. I won both. With three it feels a bit too easy to stay at home and research and upgrade your ships ready for battle.

9th play with same group, now Planta stayed at home and won.

Some of my favorite games combine economic and war elements (Cyclades, Senji, Reef Encounter). After playing a handful of solo games on Vassal to see if all the hype I'd seen was founded in a good game I knew this one would be a keeper. I love the relatively compact playtime, a solid economic core and fighting, wheeling, and dealing between players. The most striking thing about the game for me has been that it is very enjoyable to play whether I win or lose, I just love the story arc that the game presents. Another plus is that it plays up to 6.

With so many ways to win and play, I'm a big fan on the game mechanics, theme, and interaction with players. You can even have alliances with other players which can be betrayed. Lots a depth, strategy and fun! Definitely not a gateway game and play with with people that are patient.

RATING: 9
UPDATE: Selling my copy of Eclipse. I love this game, but it only shines with a large (6-9 player) gaming group. We typically have 2 - 4 players, and only 3 gamers maximum. It's not great at this player count. We're keeping Clash of Cultures, which has the same feel, but works at smaller player counts. Unfortunately, Eclipse needs to be taking to London on Board (our local gaming group) and played in an all-night session from 5:30 to 10:30pm. The occasions when we can do this due to husband's working hours mean it's unlikely to get played more than once or twice a year :(

UPDATED: Rating raised to 10 after playing two-player, despite an unbalanced Orion/Hydra game where Jon wiped out my forces plus the Galactic Centre on turn three. It's like the heavy version of Cyclades two-player... A brutal wargame with a cool sci-fi theme, and science and economic bits.

UPDATED: To 9 after playing a six-person game in four hours. It's an epic 4x space game playable in an evening - ameritrash feel, but running a euro strategy engine to introduce speed, smoothness and skill. Loads of shouting. Absolutely brilliant fun. I'd recommend it to anyone who fancies TI3, but isn't sure about the running time: there's skullduggery in spades with the right crowd - we had three traitors in one game.

****

My husband loves this and wants to play it constantly (two-player). He'd probably give it a 9.

I'd give it a 6 or 7. Winning seems too dependent on which tiles you discover when you 'explore'. We've played twice and the first time I found a bunch of habitable star systems while exploring (and won). The second time, he did (and won). I'm sure it's not as simple as that, but I felt this luck factor was unfair for a game that is broadly skill-based.

The fighting system is absurdly silly. Roll X dice and see what hits... Regardless of what technology you've bolted to your ships, you'll miss most of the time.

The pieces are good quality, but the artwork is ugly. Lots of bits in the box for the money. If you're considering getting Eclipse, I'd definitely recommend it.

Played this once with 4 players and the following house rules suggested by the experienced player at the table: (a) players choose from +1 tile for their first 3 explorations, (b) turn order for next round is determined by passing order this round, (c) tech tiles available next turn are on display this turn.

All in all I think this is a very successful attempt at a 2-3 hour 4X game (at least with 4 players, which I sense is the game's sweet spot). Even though I'm not the target audience for this type of game, I can appreciate why it has risen so astronomically in the BGG rankings. However, the plasma missiles really do warp the combat dynamic in an unpleasant and uninteresting way, and without the aforementioned house rules I would find serious fault with the randomness of the game. Even with them, the randomness of tile draws ans dice rolls can be a decisive factor in who does well, but in fairness I suppose that's intrinsic to this type of game and thus to an extent unavoidable.

I'd be more interested in playing and possibly even owning Eclipse if it weren't for the plasma missiles. Not that they alone are the culprit, but they're bothersome enough to push me off the fence where I would otherwise be sitting with regards to further exploring this game.

RATING: 4
The problem, I think, is that I just don't like 4X games (too much aggression, when what I really prefer is confrontation), but that's not the only thing wrong with Eclipse.  Part of it is the time of the game (2-3 hours with two players, and I saw a game of six take over six hours, not including rules explanation), and then the other part is the randomness of the technology tiles.  It can really, really suck for the player going last if very few weapons technologies come out and he's stuck without him.  Being the nature of these sorts of games, the weakest player will just become a target for every other player, and it just stops being fun when you're being beaten on by everyone else.  I only played one two-player game, which probably exacerbated the issue, but that was enough for me to get a feel for it and realize this just isn't my sort of game.  For folks who like that sort of aggression, I get the feeling they'll like it, but for me, it's just more frustrating that anything else.

And no, in no way the succesor to TI3 many europhiles want you to believe it is. Politics in this game are a joke, not even an afterthough, races so samey that there's almost no point in picking one over the others, picking technologies at random from a bag...are you frikking kidding me?

What an amazing experience. I love pretty much all about it. Graphic design and character design is really well made with a strong retro vibe. All the X's are here:

EXplore - Even when every tile possible is explored you still feel like a conqueror, finding discoveries, gaining special reputation tiles (SotR), hives (RotA), anomalies (SotR) behaving in an unpredictable ways...

EXpand - You can see the color of your empire spreading all over the galaxy! It looks and feels powerful.

EXploit - Every technology you get, every planet you harvest, every discovery you find and implement... The galaxy is yours to dominate.

EXterminate - Tons of dice on top of a Euro engine. It's such a beautiful contradiction. Battling is unpredictable as it should be. No silly cards, no power points just you, your opponents and shooting across the space!

My favourite multiplayer game of all time.

I can certainly see why Eclipse has become such a phenomenon on BGG. I think that most of us that are "geek" enough to like boardgames, are predisposed to liking space and science fiction as well. Previous games offered in this genre have had a tendency to be both long and complicated. As a general rule, that put most of them squarely in the province of wargamers and ameri-trashers.

Eclipse though, is a different beast. It utilizes a ton of streamlining and abstraction to eliminate the usual tedium of tracking resource production, empire sprawl and trade, i.e., the things that usually make managing a cardboard empire a real chore. Also, there is little, if any, downtime between turns. The only thing that slows play down is combat...but again, compared to other games of the genre it plays out very quickly.

One thing I was surprised to discover is that Eclipse isn't the Space Civilization game many early adopters have made it out to be. The technology base of the game is almost entirely military, so victory via more passive approaches is nigh impossible. There isn't much in the way of objectives either. The vast majority of victory points come through aggressive behavior. It is a race to conquer from the start, so if you typically play your games with an eye for the merchant win, you might want to find a different game.

Once you've dispelled the illusion that you will be doing anything other than smashing face, you can begin to enjoy Eclipse for what it is. The technology system is pretty interesting, as new advances appear in a random order every game, making them more or less valuable depending on the timing. This has ripple effects throughout the game, altering the strategies of players and forcing them to adapt to the constantly fluctuating power levels of their opponent's war vessels. Which brings me to the the most interesting part of the game.

Warships in Eclipse do not have fixed abilities or combat ratings. They are almost completely modular and allow players to customize them with quite a bit of tactical flexibility. A player can focus on building first strike missile boats, "unsinkable" hulls, or lightning fast interceptors that can deliver neutron bombs behind enemy lines. It's a great feature and the one thing that will keep me coming back to this game, when the Cult of the New buzz wears off. I'm not sure I see it as a top 5 game...but it's a damn good one.

Fun game, takes a bit of time, fairly easy to learn.  However, ain't worth the $100 MSRP, $150 CSI markup price tag.  A $60 game at most and that's being pretty lenient. Would play again, ended up preordering it despite my reservations.

Also, WAY too much hype on BGG right now. Doesn't deserve to be in Top 10.  Somewhere in the Top 100, sure, but not 10. Thought about adjusting my rating down to '1' until it reaches ratings parity but people would just call me a troll if I did.

The more I play Eclipse, the more it feels like an economic euro game...and that's not a good thing.

Exploration by drawing tiles seems far too random.  I would prefer starting with a balanced or symmetric map.

The ship building/upgrading/movement system is extremely clunky, resulting in action efficiency favoring those who hold material reserves (as a "virtual fleet") and simply build a fleet after being attacked.

For a game that takes so long, there are a lot of wildly random elements. Exploration is understandably so, since, well... [i]it's space[/i], but combat between players taking five or six turns of misses before a shot hits home is a little bit much.

Alliances apparently don't mean all that much. The downtime, especially with an AP player, is excruciating.

I [i]want[/i] to like Eclipse, so I'll give this another try since it's a favorite of several players in my group. If it takes 6 hours again, though, it will probably be my last attempt.

This looks really nice overall. An attempt to do a 4X, civ-in-space in a manageable timeframe and with streamlined rules, but without too many compromises.  Hopefully it works.

Having read the rules and the previews, my concerns at this point are: too few techs, too little differentiation, and a strangely involved combat system. The designer really likes the idea of unique ship types, but it features awfully prominently relative to the other aspects. The action system looks great (cost escalation tied to size of empire or number of actions taken).

This is a very fun game, assuming you have the space. Lot's of depth, lot's of variability, most games don't play the same, and often it's hard to spot who is winning.  This ensures most people play to the end... and with lots of opportunity for play different play styles, this is a good thing.

The only downside is length and how much space a game of 3+ players takes.  With 6 playmats, 1 neutral mat, tons of set-up time, lots of bits and pieces... a normal table is just not enough space to play this game.

Probably close to a 10 anyway but it's the 2500th game I've added to my collection so it gets top billing.  No doubt this is the Eurocized version of TI3 and probably more of a Warro than a Euro.  It's also a non-discriminating multi bit game with wood, plastic, and cardboard bits.

I've played TI3 and now this.  I can appreciate both games.  Eclipse does play fairly fast compared to TI3 but of course you lose some of the theme.

Great game, I love the technology tree and the way your money, science, and materials work.  Using influence counters to track how much your economy needs to spend money to control hexes and perform actions is a very clever idea.

Eclipse places you in control of a vast interstellar civilization, competing for success with its rivals. You will explore new star systems, research technologies, and build spaceships to wage war with. There are many potential paths to victory, so you need to plan your strategy according to the strengths and weaknesses of your species, while paying attention to the other civilizations' endeavors.

Excellent components that really help streamline the play and very elegant mechanics.

This game is a lot of fun with the right group.  

A few potential issues though, since you can win without directly interacting with others players some people will play this way and drag the game down (I am not a big fan of Euro-style indirect conflict games).  Another caution is that chance will play a big part of the game (I don't mind this but some players do), techs are randomly chosen, discoveries also, as well as the tiles themselves and the number of VPs you get from combat as well as the use of dice for combat (like I said I don't mind this YMMV).

Mix of TI3+TTA+GE. After first play, impressed a bit less than hoped. Not that much tension or epic feeling compared to TI3.
Production quality is not impressive too, sector tiles are glossy and prone to visible scratches, and worst is that race sheets are of comparably thin paper and they need to hold tens of wooden counters in correct places. Mine sheets are already bending and counters do not keep well on them..
Update: the hype is fading away. I find me not wanting to play it anymore. Maybe sometimes..

On the one hand: an excellent game that beautifully synthesizes the complexities of a 4x game into a playable length of time.  Fun and tense.  On the other hand, something about its Eurogame efficiency leaves me a bit cold; the theme somehow comes off as a bit dry.  And combat is, sadly, a bit dull.

Rating influenced by the fact that this is not my kind of game. Too long, too rules, to waiting others' turns.
Anyways, it has a solid structure, some very good ideas (ship management is great, i adore to customize my fleet as i prefer). About the rest, nothing very new. Simpler of TI3 maybe, but still soooo long (4 hours to finish the first 7 turns , then we quit).
I don't like the VP after battles.

Phenomenal 4x design, likely the best there is. Unfortunately, the art is awful. Only potential gameplay concerns are that hitting reasonably colonizable systems from random tile flipping is important early and not doing so means getting behind on the first turn, which compounds quickly, and how cheesy it is to be able to change ship loadouts with instant effect across the galaxy to effectively overhaul a fleet before a combat (specific weapons are good or bad against specific defenses, so this matters immensely and it feels like a bug rather than an intended design).

Great game but not for us. Call me crazy but I got Exodus instead. Eclipse tech tree system is too limiting and often unbalanced advantage, combat system is uninspiring, and I miss the politics.

Episch spel waarin de spelers volken vertegenwoordigen die het heelal verkennen en daarbij elkaar ook bevechten voor dominantie over de planeten. Hierbij gebruiken ze verschillende soorten schepen die ook nog eens te upgraden zijn met allerlei verschillende soorten wapens schilden of computers.

Het spel heeft zeer veel onderdelen, maar is toch vrij snel uit te leggen.

Toch geeft het spel niet echt een gevoel van ultieme controle. Er is iets te veel afhankelijk van een aantal geluksfactoren, zoals geluk hebben met gebieden die je ontdekt en dat net de juiste technologiën beschikbaar komen voor jou.

Ik zal dit zeker nog een keer willen spelen en hoop dan wat meer meester te zijn van het geluk

RATING: 3
Totally overrated game. Crassly overproduced, partly clumsily handled components (e.g. tech upgrades which lengthen set-up time). Random tile draws escalate irreparable discrepancies in victory chances too early for so heavy and lengthy a game. The combat engine is a joke, in the last instance.

Do not buy before a thoroughly revised version is produced which tackles the design issues well identified in some reviews here on BGG.

I'd ordinarily rate this a 5, but peg it as a 3 to counterbalance some of the unwarranted 10s.

RATING: 8.8
Probably the best cardboard simulation of the space opera genre that one could hope to own. Eclipse does an excellent job in all phases of 4X as players rush to explore, expand and exploit their surroundings during the first rounds of cold war before the inevitable rush to exterminate one's neighbors in the closing rounds. My only criticism is one which holds true for most combat-focused games in that players who manage to avoid large battles typically win out over those who have committed their resources toward more spectacular, but no more rewarding, brawls over tiles at the maps's center.

OMG!  Believe the hype.  First time our group played this, we agreed to get together the next night for another go, instead of waiting our usual week.  That has never happened before. It shines because it combines everything fun about gaming - there's interaction, strategy, resource management, area control, worker placement, combat, diplomacy, randomness, tight mechanics, ultra-cool theme, multiple paths to victory, etc.  It's a beautiful design.  It's challenging, fulfilling, and very replayable due to the organic expansion of the galaxy and the adapting strategies you have to employ depending on the hexes and tiles you draw.  Might be a knee-jerk reaction to rate this a 10 after a single play, but it's obvious this is one great game.

I want my space games to be loud and sexy, not drawn-out operas that sing in Italian for 3+ hours and bore me to tears.  If you like to peer down at your games from the royal viewing balcony, though, [i]Eclipse[/i] could be up your alley.

I could prattle on about my general dislike of 4X games, but it boils down to the fact that I find them to be scripted (OK, time to scout resource planets...) and not remotely fun.  As I explore the Big Black, I want to cut through the hull of an abandoned shuttle and have an alien vault onto my face and rip the corneas from my eyes.  I don't want to massage my tech tree and resource scheme so that I can upgrade my light fighters to lightly armored light fighters.

It's also annoying that [i]Eclipse[/i] has the same flaw as every other 4X game: if you flip the wrong resource/planet tiles during your exploration phase, you're probably screwed.

Non-4X space games I'd rather play: [i]Star Trek Fleet Captains[/i], [i]Shadowlord![/i], [i]Battleship Galaxies[/i].

4X games I'd rather play: [i]Galactic Emperor[/i], [i]Empires of the Void[/i], [i]Ascending Empires[/i].

A 4X game I will never play: [i]Twilight Imperium[/i], because I don't want to jump into a 6-8 hour game that I know I'll hate.

Warning: I don't rate any 4X games higher than a 6, so my comments should be taken with a grain of salt, pepper, or resource of your choice.

It is though one to rate. I love its graphic design that makes it so easy to play despite complicated nature. I love the space theme done with euro style mechanics. One thing that keeps me from totally endorsing this one is that it seems that most of the time the player that will stay out of conflicts at the start of the game will be able to win (especially if his race is good at generating points otherwise ex.: Hydran Progress).

Just wish the combat was smoother and less of a focus, this NOT 4x game it is space economics!

Imports a lot of pleasant Euro-y things into an Ameritrash game with mixed results.  While some of the Euro mechanics are welcome - the board/playboard/cube mechanic lifted from Through the Ages works very well - Euro banality does eventually inflict damage on the game's theme.  See: awarding randomized victory points for simply having combat.  Why do this?  Because we want to encourage combat!  Thus gross idiocy triumphs over nuanced development, and gaminess triumphs over theme.

Will I play it again?  Certainly.  But it doesn't scratch an itch on the ass of TI:3.

Fun, plays briskly as each action resolves quickly.  Nice empire building feel.  Definitely some luck in the tile draw, but hard to say how important it is.

Very cool game; nice design (gameboard as well as the starships) and lots of ways to win so you can try out different strategies. Two major downsides though; first of all the little cubes which are hell for klutzes like me. And secondly the fact that this game is very prone to "analysis paralysis". Because you can score in many ways, you'll probably end up with at least one adversary who'll analyse every single scenario before making a move. Since players cannot play at the same time, this makes for long pauses. So a piece of advice; choose your fellow players wisely and don't play with the guy that already has trouble choosing a drink...

Setup takes a while with all the game mats and tiles, but it's worth it.  The tile exploration is fun, the ship upgrades are fun albeit a little frustrating when the tech you want doesn't show up or is taken by another player.  Combat is intense because you just never know if the dice are going to roll your way or not.  Managing your money, materials, and science can be tricky, unless your explorations end up being great early in the game. I do wish the game was a little longer -- not TI3 long, but let me do some stuff with my fully upgraded ships and huge empire before the game ends.

RATING: 4
Something doesn't sit right with me in this one.  Has a WP mechanic and an economic engine, but has a hidden area control component as well.  But there is a great disincentive to attack anybody.  Usually, the first person to flinch (and their unwitting opponent) will go down in flames while everybody else marches on to victory.  Don't like the way that area control influences the game by sectioning the board up among players.  Your options disappear as the game goes on.  Just really a mish-mosh of too many unrelated mechanisms and a horrible runaway leader problem.  But its pretty, if that's your thing.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
While I've only been able to play this game a handful of times, I know that it is something that I really enjoy. 

It is essentially an economic civilization building game with an element of war mixed in with a healthy dose of luck. There are so many possibilities each round yet everything is very streamlined and not overly complicated. You're constantly trying to balance everything that you'd like to do with what you can economically afford. You also need to pay attention to what your opponents are doing as what might seem like a healthy alliance could come back to bite you if you're not careful.

Playing with the asymmetrical powers of the aliens really brings out the best in the game. While one race may seem overpowered at the beginning, another race might have a more beneficial longer-term strategy. Playing to your races strengths is key and is something that I haven't been able to explore due to my limited plays. I also think that you need to play the game with at least 4 as there isn't enough tension in the early parts of the game with 3. While I have only been able to play the game once with 4 and with the difference races, I can see its potential and wish that I could play it more.

Great space Civilization game that has a good mix of luck and planning mixed together. This is NOT the space epic Twilight Imperium is but it also takes far less time.

People have called it banking in space... but I see it as governing in space, resources are limited within a civilization and good accounting is an important part of governing effectively, it is however only one part of an effective civilization and I don't think many people would say a good banker makes a good leader. It certainly won't make you good aT eclipse.

Seems quite interesting and I like the three resource tracks and way that work placement costs money. Based on watching videos, it seems like I won't like the combat mechanics and direct conflict inherent in the game as much. Too long as well.

Someone took Masters of Orion--one of my favorite PC games--and turned it into a wildly popular board game.  Will basically never turn down a game of this.  It can get brutally long with too many people, though, so be careful of what you get yourself into.

The technologies and upgrades for spaceships are fun. The initial exploration seems too luck-driven though, as are the reputations points earned after a combat. Expensive game due to the many components.

After just one play, this game looks like it will shape up to be everything I was hoping it would be. I can definitely see where some people may have concerns about runaway leader or "overpowered" techs, but those only seem to crop up with passive or potentially poor play—just like with actual PC 4x games.

After finishing the game, I wanted to go again immediately, despite having played for several hours and being exhausted. That's the sign of a true winner of a game for me.

Odiado por todo fan de lo ameritrash y de los war games por decir que apesta a "euro", es muy superficial, tiene un último turno muy oportunista y algo de azar con las tiles...

Pero aquí voto yo y este me mola y mucho.

+ Pulsar.
+ The tractor beam.
+ Resurgir de los antiguos.

Me deshice de un par de expansiones sin jugarlas porque con el reglamento en la mano me parecía demasiada regla y tiempo de explicación para lo que lo voy a jugar.

Brilliant mechanics. BUT.. this is not an ameritrash game. This is also not a 4X game. This is an accounting game with space combat and exploration thrown as distraction. So don't expect to experience being a mighty emperor of some alien civilisation.

I'm very impressed with this desing. Some TTA-like population control, some Galaxy Trucker-like ship building, plus ameritrash fighting.

Rating will likely descend sharply with more plays. Much like an attack ship on fire...


I think [i]Galactic Emperor[/i] is superior to this, but I am clearly in a very small slither of a minority of thinking here. BGG is a GEEK site that has a love affair with sci-fi themed games above all else. This game delivers its dose of confirmation bias to those that need it, overlooking significant flaws.

Quick summation - as I should be doing something else right now.

1. Draw a few shitty explore tiles early in your game - forget it. Make a coffee. Bake a pie. Plan what game you'll play when the choice of the evening comes 'round to you. Don't plan on doing a victory dance.

2. Doesn't feel like you're ruling a space empire. At all. Fun has escaped out of the airlock.

3. Mostly a solitaire game until the dreaded LAST TURN KING-MAKING BATTLE.

4. Turtling is encouraged. Space battles are infrequent and uninspired.

5. Tech tiles are hugely numerous, fiddly, and mostly boring.

6. Another commentator put it better than I ever could 'Plays way too long, but ends before things get interesting.'


All said and done - this game is made for others (not me) who desire such things.

Received a hansome sum as a Christmas present from Gwen's parents for Christmas 2012 and turned part of it into Eclipse!  Thanks G&G!

This is the epic space game for me!  There is enough empire management for us Euro-philes and the quick pace and limited expansion of the board make for some tense combats along the way.  It scales well and plays surprisingly quickly.  I think I'm just going to like this more and more as I get a chance for more plays.

Don't understand the hype and high rating for this game.  It's a decent enough space empire game, but I can't say that I found it any better than a half dozen other similar games.  In fact, I would actually prefer to play Galactic Destiny because there's almost no politics in this game nor are there any cards which add to the theme.  Most of the mechanics seemed fairly typical besides the action marker/cost one.  While a 6 player game has more interaction, the downtime gets fairly high.

Some consider it as an Ameri-game, but it's a typical euro with pasted on theme. When it comes to space 4X games i will always play TI3.

RATING: 7.5
To be honest, I haven't played this game much.  I love the mechanics.  Though, when I first tried it, I had never played a 'worker placement' style game, so it took me a round or two to understand the mechanics of it.
I would like to play it more, but for a few small issues.
First, the game takes up A LOT of space (no pun intended).  The table i have just isn't enough room for a good game.  I can fit 2, maybe 3 player.  But as soon as I add more than that, the tech sheet has to go on a coffee table beside us - not terribly convenient for play.  
Second, (sort of an extension of the first) is the fact that each persons personal play sheet and resource management can be quite tedious.  When you're moving your own blocks around, your oft to accidentally knock one out of place and spend a couple of minutes just trying to figure out which resource type it was supposed to be on.  And when it's another player sheet, it is really hard to, at a glance, figure out what is going on.  The fact that each person has resource trackers that are tiny, vaguely coloured and (and this is a big one) too big to fit on the single number track together (ie, if all your resources are at the same number, you'll often stack them, and have them fall over and yet again spend a few minutes trying to figure out where they should be) makes the game more *fiddly* than it could be.  
Thirdly, combat.  Not quick to resolve.  It seems like it should be quick.  But it isn't.  You will be taking your ships on and off the board, just to have them lined up in initiative order, then trying to remember each ships upgradestats.  And the pips on the upgrades DON'T correspond to pips on the dice - very counter-intuitive.  
It works, but again, it's just not streamlined.  This game should steal some of the component/mechanical ideas from other games to fix the frustrating fiddlyness.  
Again, mechanically, it is a sound game that is enjoyable once a session actually starts flowing and you remember how each part works.  But, the first few rounds will be spent going "so...  how many dice do I need?" or "which block is supposed to be there?" etc...

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I was pleasantly surprised at how streamlined and enjoyable all of the action was in this game. It is faster to play and more accessable than Twilight Imperium, however it does have less depth. Overall, I can convince more of my friends to play this game over the marathon that is TI, even though I do absolutely love both.

Initial rating after the second game. This crams the epic scifi civilization game into a nice timeframe. Some of the epicness is lost and this suffers from the typical euro syndrome that it ends just when things start to get interesting, but otherwise it's solid goodness (and I wouldn't call this game an euro to it's face, it might devour me and use my bones as raw material for it's ships). I have a feeling that rating may rise to 10 in the future.

and a sidenote: ship desing is horrid, even thought they are made from nice hard plastic.

So much going on in this game, yet so much that I feel I can get from other games. Combat is such a chore and I feel that it really bogs the game down. I'm totally willing to play it again, but I don't think I'll ever recommend it or try to get into a play of it.

RATING: 7
Just a placeholder vote based on an almost full playtrough. It's probably not a fair estimate, but this first game was boring and somewhat frustrating. Needs a second play for a proper evaluation.

Update: played a couple more games on the iPad and while playing with fast AI really helped a lot, I still can't see the reasons for the huge praise this game as gathered. It's a solid sci-fi evolution of Risk, but not much more to me. I think a huge part of its success comes by the fact that it works and the theme of space conquest is well implemented. I still can't see any signs of a masterpiece though... and I can imagine these relatively quick playthrough on the iPad would translate in a whole evening of game time in reality (both because of the ridiculous fiddliness/sheer amount of components and AP).
Still, it can easily deserve a 7, maybe more, but not so much more (for me at least).

RATING: 4
Upgrading on-the-fly, building into blockaded systems, the increasingly familiar polarization of designs, plasma-missile laden starbases, the inability to fight effectively on more than one front, and too-swingy discovery draws are nagging problems. 

That said, this game does get a lot right.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
The only possible complaint here (assuming you don't just detest 4X games) is the length, but even that isn't quite as bad as it's been made out to be.  The box says 30 per player.  Most commentary suggests 60 per player.  I say it's more like 40 minutes per person.  Six player is gonna go a long time, but six player would be pretty epic.  (Most I've managed is 4 player, and I've heard you don't want to play 5 without the warp board rules.)

Definitely one of my favorite games.  Time permitting, I'll play every time it hits the table.

Have now played with every player count except 9.  The only game I'd actively avoid is 5, and with the expansion materials even that isn't too much of a problem anymore.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I find the game to be broken in that it claims to have an economic element but you can't win that way. You can only win by beating up on the other players. I'm trying to like this but I can't see it going above a 7. It has so much promise. Once I get a chance to play Exodus I have a feeling this will drop substantially.

RATING: 6
PROS: Great game. Fantastic tribute of MOO2. Mulitiple paths to victory. Multiple races. Humans are thematically accurate and still very appealing compared to other races. No race is out of balance.

CONS: Game always currently ends in a huge explosion of ships - game often comes down to building up a powerful fleet and going all out at the end. Still doesn't change the fact this is a GREAT game.

Only one play so far but this game has it all. Simple rules, deep complexity, moderate playing-time, tons of interaction and a modular board along with variable races and a tech tree. Really, really good game - likely the best of 2011 and surely one of the best of the last 5 years.

A gem of a 4x game that reminds me a little of Galactic Civilizations on PC. The customization of your ships is a brilliant idea and implemented in an excellent fashion. This is where the game shines for me. 

Beware that there is randomness in the draw of tiles, research, dicerolls but that it can be mitigated by adaptive play and the right choices. People who mind a luck factor will probably not like the game very much, but if you like a strategy of adapting yourself to the situation on the board and see what you can make of it, then the game is for you. 

It doesnt have as many options as Twilight Imperium, but I find it clearer and more streamlined. It's also more a eurogame score VP game compared to the fantasy flight esque space game of TI. One thing TI does better is the diplomacy with a voting system and it has a more fleshed out story. Eclipse has a more euroesque mechanic with actions-resource interaction. While TI is strategic resource management with negotiation.

First impression after one play. I wasn't too thrilled. It's a bit difficult to really understand what you actually should be doing, what to expect and what's the smartest choice etc. when playing for the first time.. more plays will undoubtedly make this more clear. Once all players know what they're doing, this game should make a decent fast filler.

A rather dry Euro game, with quick playing time, logical game mechanics, and a rather brutal series of unfortunate events destroying anything you have built every few turns. It is not very lavishly produced, and it is entirely lacking in theme, but it's a clever and intriguing puzzle with a nice auction phase.

Good game...great components for self-published and good ruleset.  With 8 turns, it's a good length.  You get to build your little kingdom before the bottom drops out.

I'll probably buy this one.

Update: Bought it, and a few more plays in, I'm upping this to an 8.  Super-intuitive game play.  Easy to teach, but the hardest point to get across is also the most important: the end-game scoring.  It's a favorite of mine now.

+ Plays so fast for a civ-building game (albeit a light civ game); The auction rules are very cool, especially when compared with the standard auctions seen in so many other games.

Good civilization auction game. Desasters add a lot of tension. However, the game can be unforgiving, especially for beginners. I do not like the general unforgiveness of the game. I start to like Peloponnes Card Game more because of its smaller box size, it has more flexible gameplay and it is more forgiving.
The artwork is okay, not great.

I think it's a fun, quirky game. One other player called it borderline filler, which I would potentially agree with. The "auction" is so weird. You only have one opportunity to place a claim on a tile. But I'm okay with it. It's doing something different.

The disasters are eh, but provide a context of chaos to coast through and see whose city has the best balance of points. It's fast and breezy and not something I would get overly invested in.

I liked this quite a bit. Playing really fast was a great benefit to this. There is some tension as far as the disasters and the bidding is pretty interesting. In 2p there aren't really all too many overbids, but you do want to make sure that you'll bid enough to still get a tile.

The land restriction is a little wonky and doesn't add a whole lot to the game, I feel, but the game itself plays pretty tightly and the endgame feeding can really shake up the scores.

RATING: 8
Anyone coming to Peloponnes hoping for a one-hour civ game is likely to be disappointed.  Peloponnes is fundamentally an auction game with a bit of bookkeeping.  Auctions are Evo-style, with the added restriction that a bid cannot be raised after you are overbid.  Acquired buildings and lands bring an interesting variety of immediate benefits, turn by turn resources, special powers and end of game victory points.  The interaction of disasters with a periodic requirement to feed your population and pay for "mortgaged" buildings brings variability.

Peloponnes is light on rules and doesn't have a great many moving parts. It is true that there is not a great number of decisions in any one game - but they are all important and there are alternative strategies to explore.  It has clearly been thorouhly developed and tested; it purrs along like a well oiled machine.  I like it quite a bit.

Component quality is entirely acceptable.  The artwork is nothing special.

Surprisingly deep for a fast-playing game with a Civ building game set in Ancient Greece. You have relatively few decision points in the game, but they all count. There is an auction mechanism done right, and several interesting routes to victory. Definitely worth playing when that 1-hour game is needed.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A very good game, the auction system is good and although there is quite a lot of luck involved in particular being able to get the right land tile to link up with what you have - this isn't always possible. The disaster tiles aren't fun and can seriously hamper you.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Very tense and tight game with only a few very hard decisions in short playing time. This game has a potential for 10-rating.
EDIT: Well, the game had potential for 10-rating, but I have to drop the rating to 8 (from 9). This is still very good game, but not one the best. Luck and chaos have too big effect on the outcome.

RATING: 7.5
We would never have tried this had a friend not talked us into it one night. Thanks Bill. We steered clear of this because we do not like auction games. But this auction game does something most other auction games doesn't. It plays out like a real auction. If you bid for something but get outbid you don't lose what you bid originally. You get it back. How about that? A realistic auction. There's that and it is also a quick civilization building game that requires some planning and forethought but not so much that it induces mind numbing analysis paralysis. The art on the cards is stylistic and evocative. It's easy to play and it makes you think in a fun way.It's only detriment is that as a two-player game it scales down too much. I'm not sure if that makes sense. With 3 it was great. At 4 it was awesome. But at 2 it was just ok.

Great tile-laying civilization game, only it feels a lot more like a proper board game than another of his designs, Palmyra, which is also tile placement. Here you are buying and profiting from both Building and Line tiles that you have bid upon, and then watching with fear as the disaster tokens start to add up, causing conditions that can mess with your setup. Each player has a resource/income board which is intuitive and easy to slide markers about to represent what your resources, money and population is at. I also like that some tiles are resistant to certain disasters. All told, this is a great, underrated game and I'll be buying the expansion collection coming out later in the year. For me this is kind of a Carcassonne-killer, but only base game to base game.

RATING: 9
Pelopnnes is a very good, very solid, very tight auction game where every decision matters. Furthermore, it has the rare characteristic of playing quickly.

There is an element of push-your-luck in this game. Often, you will face a decision of spending resources, which give you a higher payout, or conserve resources for potential disasters/declines. If you spend resources and a disaster/decline hits, you likely won't recover. But if you spend resources and the disaster/decline doesn't hit, you may win the game. 

That push-your-luck element certainly adds tension to the game but also makes the game less deterministic and more susceptible to variance/luck. But, so far, I've never played a game where I felt someone won because they got lucky. There is a lot of skill in valuing the actions and when/how to acquire tiles. The game feels very much like a brain burner and is quite enjoyable.

RATING: 7
Peloponnes is a Civilization-light game. Player auctions for tiles in the line, collecting wood, stone and food, while trying to prepare for various disaster and feeding of people.

It's an austere game, with rather spartan components (money is gray and white disks, for example). It is also relatively abstract (although if you squint hard, you can see the theme; although the resource building requirement seems a bit too gamey to me) and it's unforgiving to boot; you really need to get a engine going to get food.

That sounds like my beating up on the game, but kind of dug it. I like the civ-light games like 7 Wonders, and this game could be thought meaner.

RATING: 8.5
Juego para 5 jugadores (con ampliaciones, perfectamente 7), cortuco, divertido, con toques de azar y caos determinantes y con finales, por lo general, sorpresa. Muy fácil de explicar. Turnos fáciles de llevar y rápidos, una fase de subasta que a cinco o más jugadores brilla (con piques en las pujas divertidos) y un sistema de recolección fácil de aplicar . No existen esperas entre los jugadores ya que todo se hace a la vez así que para grupos de no jugones es un juego idoneo.

Componentes muy buenos y un arte para mí estupendo. Un poco engorroso el tema de llevar las cuentas deslizando discos por el track de cada tablero, pero supongo que si se hubieran puesto tokens de madera para cada valor, el precio del juego se hubiera disparado...

Ahora mismo este juego ocupa (injustamente, en mi opinión) el puesto 378 en la lista de la BGG. Es similar en complejidad al 7 Wonders, pero para mí, mucho mejor juego. Mucho mejor.

Entonces, ¿dónde falla?. Dos motivos:
- el precio (carillo, 45 euritos)
- Fuerte presencia de la suerte: en las pujas, en los momentos de hambruna, en la aparición de los desastres... Y eso no ayuda a que los jugones le den una oportunidad. Termina la partida con sensación de haber capeado el temporal, no de dominar la tormenta, y esta sensación seguro que ha sido un handicap para él.

Tile and auction game based in ancient Greece, played over 8 rounds.  Quick clean design.  But lacking that something extra that makes a great game.  The disasters are likely to be key in deciding the result, and when they come up is down to a certain amount of luck, although you can see them coming to a certain extent.

A light and enjoyable civ game. There are no maps or units, it is just a struggle to grow your civilization in both people or territory + buildings + gold. These are obtained through auctions in which anyone who is outbid must immediately bid somewhere else or pass, similarly to Evo. There are several disasters that will occur and it is challenging to keep all of these conflicting needs in hand. This game most reminds me of Ra, because it is basically a series of auctions in which you can attempt to push your luck with the order in which disasters and population feeding times will occur.

Learned it solo, then it was a while until I got to play with others...5 total of us.  The rules are pretty easy to grasp, then teach.  It plays fairly quickly, and the auction mechanism is great.  Everyone enjoyed it.  One of my gripes is the player boards are sorta skimpy.  Also, any little bump of them could mess up your resource markers, since the markers are light and slide around easily.  

*Traded off - I won't miss it too much. The gaps between plays always made me forget rules and fucked up my chances of winning.  Ha.

The auction style and buying restrictions turn this from an average game to an unplayable one. Get the wrong resource tile early and you'll never be able to afford another one,go early in the turn order and get pushed out of getting anything if unlucky and then be badly positioned to deal with an arbitrary disaster to ensure you'll have no fun.

I really don't get the hype here.

First play: With four newbies and a cold start learning the rules we managed to finish a game in just over an hour.

An excellent game with an interesting emulsion of mechanics borrowed and tweaked from a number of proven games to produce a very solid and enjoyable game with some crunchie decisions to be made.

Some minor niggles: the player aid uses misleading language for actions 5 & 6 where phrasing something like 'White Bonus' (for 5) and 'Brown Production' (for 6) would have been much clearer. Also the iconography for Land and Building tiles could have been seperated to avoid possible confusion (NB: a paste on correction showing the urban tile for earthquake has been added). However neither of these items matter too much once you have the rules and game flow off pat.

The need to balance population vs land and building points is a great leveling mechanism and the point structure seems very tight.

We liked it so much we played again immediately. A streamlined and well balanced offering by Bernd Eisenstein and a great introduction for Iron Games. More please.

I'm beefing against euros in general, but I would consider playing this and I might even introduce it to people who like this sort of game.

I normally abhor phased tiles, but this didn't do anything crazy from one phase to the next, which is actually quite refreshing...  and it allows the fly to drink from the pool, yet there is some depth of play here for the elephants.

EDIT:  Ok, I do have a problem with this game.  While I'm playing this, I get the feeling this conversation took place with the designer.

Player: "This was good, but it's more or less a really basic auction game.  I mean, I didn't see anything special about it."

Designer: "You know, you're right...  wait, what if we...  made it so you couldn't build lands next to one another unless they shared the same resource?  ...and...  what if we had it be the lower of people x 3 or buildings."

and after playing the elegance that I've played, I just want to scream, "whose useless f-ing idea was this?!"  I mean, it's really like they were afraid it wasn't 'wacky' enough and decided to tack some stuff on to what could have otherwise been a pretty elegant, albeit simple, game.

...and in hindsight, it does require that a person have an idea of how much wheat they're going to need at the beginning of the game, and the rough idea of how often wheat could come up, which earns them a big thumbs-down for basically stacking the deck too heavily in favor of the one guy at the table who has played it before.

Nice civilization style building game where everything boils down to just one decision each turn. The rest is just bookkeeping. Still due to the original bidding mechanic in which you can change a bid to another tile if you get outbid but you can't change your bid at that time really makes it an original and engaging game. Not a real highflyer but a solid family game.

RATING: 7
Introduced to me as an auction, light civilization game and I think that fits.  The chaos and destruction that happens to your civilization reminds me of In The Year of the Dragon, but I liked Peloponnes quite a bit more.  Partially because it's not as much of an investment as the game falls apart around you.

My second play was fun, but not quite as destructive and interesting as the first play.  I've rated this game an 8 and it's a good game, but I think another play or two would be required to know how I really feel.

After three plays, I still like it.  I can see playing this once in a while.  It's the perfect length and weight for a game with this kind of chaos and destruction.  Dropped my rating to 7.5... it's a good game.

Wow, what a fantastic game and generally I’m not a fan of auction games! It’s very stream lined but there is plenty to think about. The disasters are really a stroke of genius. They add a ton of tension and variety. Depending how they come out, the game plays very differently. There is no down time and just the right amount of player interaction. You can totally mess with another player but won’t go out of your way to do it because your own goals are too important and disaster is always looming.  This game and Welcome to Walnut Grove are my favorite lite Euro games.

Enjoyable and surprisingly heavy for a game of this length. A great auction mechanism with some brutal scoring mechanics (lowest of 2) and some vicious disasters.

It was hard work to pull out any sort of score first time out and it seemed that this is one of those games you are going to need to play once or twice before you have any chance of competing, but it certainly gave me the impression that the effort would be rewarded.

A perfectly fine game, but nothing really groundbreaking. Overall it is a pretty boring game, but the auction mechanism is fairly fun. The solo game doesn't really hold my interest, but we enjoyed the 2 player game as a light auction style game. The push your luck element of the disasters is fun as well. I probably wouldn't buy again if given the chance, but so far it is staying in the collection. It just seems like the kind of game that I may never be excited to pull off the shelf. Update: Traded away because we had no interest in playing this again.

Played on my iPad and didn't liked it at all.

Peloponnes feels very random, specially the disaster event's order which are totally unpredictable and affects more some players than others not based on skill but luck.

The goal is to balance your "achievement" points (from building and land tiles) with your population size... because your final score is the lower of these two.  The unusual auction mechanic and the restrictive tile-placement rules (for land tiles) make for a very intense auction game... but it seems unbalanced to me.  Sometimes you can get stuck in a really bad rut, unable to play the land tiles that come out for auction for several rounds.  Also, I don't like the high cost of buildings and the massive pile of unused resources at the end of the game.  

Note to self: the plague protection buildings are very powerful since it can be hard to increase your population in the latter half of the game (based on the scarcity of people icons on building/land tiles late in the game).

To Do List: Prismcat says this game is broken and that all you need to do is go for population and you can ignore everything else.  Try this as a strategy the next time I play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A civ game based around tiles, no overall board, that plays in an hour? bargain! OK there's lots of disasters, but they can be planned for and even if they do destroy all your hard work, you've only lost an hour of your life, rather than eight, as happens in other civ games I could mention, (followed swiftly by the words "never again!"). 

Clever VP scoring means you score the lowest or your population x3 or your VPs from buildings, fields and money, so you have to balance the two. That was a tough job to get right at times. The game has bidding for tiles, resource gathering, population growth, disasters, ways to protect yoursself vs disasters and so on, all it does not have is armies and combat.

RATING: 8
A really great civ-lite Euro game.  VERY fun!  and definitely _MY KIND OF GAME_.  But I have to admit that $60 seems pretty steep for what comes in the box.  There are very few decisions to make in the game, so I believe the outcome might be heavily weighted to luck depending upon the tile selections.  At this point I am still swimming in all the different tile combinations, but at some point I can imagine the "optimal" play becoming easier to pinpoint... unfortunately that same optimal play will become easier for the opponent's to see as well and the game might just boil down to a bidding contest.  We'll see after a LOT more plays!

Provisional rating, likely to change (I suspect go up, need to play it with different numbers of players to see how good it is with less than 4).

Bidding game dressed up as civ lite (it isn't really), asymmetric start which I really like and very nasty disasters that will happen over the game, you're just not sure when. Definitely multiple routes to victory, simple, quick, fun, and just the right amount of viciousness for me :)

** Update, still playing, still liking it - although I'm not convinced it's that good with 2 or 3. Expansion really helps, wouldn't want to play without it unless with new players. Increased to '9'

It's funny... as a solo simple civ game I love it.  However, when played with more people as an auction game, it loses some of its charm.  It's still a good game, but just not one I tend to want to play.  It's critical to understand what tiles are coming and when I introduce the game to new players, they don't know.

RATING: 7.5
Ambientado en la guerra del peloponnes, aunque es euro puro. Cada jugador tiene una ciudad con unas características propias. El juego dura 9 rondas y su mecánica principal son las subastas, que te permiten adquirir losetas de campo o edificio, que añades a uno u otro lado de tu ciudad, aumentando tu producción. En cada turno, puede suceder un desastre (al estilo de in the year of the dragon), que puede fastidiar algún elemento de tu ciudad. Es una "lucha contra los elementos"... una mala combinación de eventos seguida puede echar por tierra todo el trabajo de la partida. Es un juego para sufrir (doy fe), pero muy interesante. Lo jugué con las expansiones de atenas, cabras y sacrificios. 

Aunque no es muy complicado, no lo considero apto para no jugones. Pueden jugar hasta 8 jugadores. Aunque no tiene interacción directa, tienes que estar pendiente de los tableros del resto de los jugadores.

Seriously?

In the one game that I played, I could not get stone which meant that I could not get buildings that needed stone.  So I could not advance.  So I spent the next four rounds just taking money.

And finished second!  So why am I wasting time playing this game when it doesn't matter what I do.

I quite like this game.  Its length is just about right, the overbidding and turn order mechanics add some tension, and the disasters require a bit of planning.

It seems like getting and retaining population is key, but our first play had multiple players tying for that, so the VPs on buildings turned out to be important too.

So initial rating is a 9.  I suspect it will go down to an 8 once I get bored of it, but for now it has made a favorable impression.

Edit Apr 2010:  As above, played a few times and still like it but not worthy of a 9.  Dropped to 8.

RATING: 9
Another addition to my recent civ-lite craze pile, this one is right up there with RTtA in terms of goodness.  Tile evaluation is, in this one, stripped to the bare minimum, and then adorned with... nothing!  This is purely a tile evaluation game, as once a turn you will either bid on and win a tile, or you won't.  That's it.  The rest of the game is one big "management" round, really.  So you have 8 decisions per game, and that IS the game.  While for many this sounds like too little of a good thing, it is in fact just right.  The game is incredibly elegant, streamlined, and addictive.  You can play a 2 player game in 20-30 min, and you will be interested the whole time.  Like RTtA, it is mainly a game of managing a few resources - in RTtA, these resources are dice, while here they are icons on tiles, which you track on a player board.  The game can be enjoyed without too much thought, but more plays and better knowledge of the tiles and the effects of disaster timing will greatly enrich the play experience, as many subtle trade-offs and opportunities become visible.  This is a game where you will feel real satisfaction when you best your high score.  Great stuff, and a design I cannot commend enough.

I've been on a steady diet of gamers' gamers for over 20 years now and I can usually assess a game pretty accurately after one play - not exactly perhaps, but give or take a half point here or there my first impression is never (cough) too wrong.  But this is a game I've played three times now and still can't decide whether it's actually good, very good, or just average and I really do need to play more to find out - even now I'm not certain how much control there is - there were times I felt very much at the mercy of fate but I suspect it was no coincidence that the guy who'd read the rules and thought about the game beforehand won all three games!  What I can say is that it packs a lot into a pretty short and intense game length and I'd be surprised if you don't find a lot to like.  So don't be put off trying yourself - the jury may still be out but it's sending pretty positive vibes.  And we did like the Marty Feldman tile.

Played a fourth time with four and I still don't seem able to grok this but am convinced that it's not simply random - yes - the same player won again!  Still don't like the auction method though.

UPDATE: OK, the hopes that it might work reasonably well with 6 players seems to have been overly optimistic :) Playing anything more "serious" with 6 is always a little dicey, and Peloponnes does better than many, but it's still a little clunky.
---
I took a bit of a flyer on buying this, which is the sort of thing I usually get burned on, but it turned out to be a very pleasant surprise. Plays quickly and yet has subtlety and interesting trade-offs, the auction is clever and has interest and is able to allocate 5 items amongst the players pretty quickly, the disasters are nice and give the game a good edge to it, and the balancing of your economy is interesting. Not a world-beater, but for a quick-playing medium-weight auction game, I was impressed. I got the 6 player expansion as a promo when I got it at BGG.con, and I think it might actually scale well to 6, which would be nice as 6-player games are hard to come by.

I'm not convinced I had a ton of control over the outcome, but had a fun time playing it regardless!  The disasters are a heck of a time to plan for, especially in the early game when you haven't had a chance to really get anywhere yet... it seems like a player can get really boned on the first turn.  For example, if they buy a building and an earthquake hits on the first turn, they're more often than not just totally screwed.

Nevertheless, I still thought it was fun with an acceptable amount of luck for a 30 minute game.  Fits nicely in that super filler category.

RATING: 7
Updated 5/9/10.  Only 3 plays: 2p, 6p, 2p.

Peloponnes is an auction game with a light civilization theme that is perhaps too light, or too subtle, for the interesting aspects of the game to captivate me.  The general idea is that players bid each round on tiles that represent either land or buildings.  The tiles produce income in the form of population, money, wood, stone, or wheat.  A series of disasters occurs each game which can decimate your civilization (essentially a catch-up mechanic that leaves room for strategic responses).  At the end of eight auctions, the winner is determined by the lower of two scores: population or prestige.

The game has some interesting new mechanics (not ground-breaking, but clean and effective).  It also has a subtly-cohesive theme.  For example: the "A" era tiles are primarily land, with a few basic buildings.  The "B" and "C" era tiles have increasingly more buildings and fewer lands.  "B" Buildings are primarily wood-based, while "C" buildings are stone-based.  The two buildings that prevent the plague are the Well (in the "A" era) and the Aquaduct (in the "C" era).  Unfortunately, the graphic design masks much of the theme, as the iconography dominates 

The biggest problem with the game is that the differences in buildings don't feel important, and unless you've memorized the panoply of tiles, you unlikely to realize each round that *gasp* this is the last building that produces wheat.  The result is that, at least among new players, the auctions are rarely tense.  Why overbid someone when you can just bid on a different tile that does similar things for a similar cost?  And the game ends up feeling more luck-based than an auction game should.  Interesting auctions also require more people, but as the player count grows, I found it becomes almost impossible to keep track of what your opponents might want or need.  You won't know who is winning, or how much you should bid on what.  

I have a soft-spot for self-published games, and I like the civilization genre, but by the end of the game, I don't feel like I've built anything at all.  If I try, I can recognize, "Oh, my city-state of Corinth expanded primarily into the forests and constructed this cool Temple, Amphitheater, etc."  But it's nothing like Through the Ages, where I always have a sense of my civilization's identity.  

5 - Average game.  I'll play it if someone wants, and I'd like to play it again just to find something redeeming in there, but no one else seems to want a second crack at it. 

Quick update (7/17/10): I played a solo game this morning and found the game much more challenging than expected, even on level one.  One of the nuances that I seemed to have missed is controlling the growth of population.  My earlier complaint was that the game seemed unbalanced in that population was always the lowest score, but the escalating supply rounds simply require a more controlled growth (depleting all one's food to keep 13 population who then die a round later for lack of food is a sure way to a low population score).  More on this later, but there may in fact be more here than meets the eye.

(Game rated with Peloponnes box) I have 600+ games in my library and this could easily be in my top 20. Yes, I like it that much, but.... the theme, the art, the pallid colors, oh the pallid colors leave a bit to be desired. So, having said this, I really enjoy the core mechanics and simplistic bidding. It is as elegant and smooth a civ builder your going to play in an hour with 3-4. The game starts slow but really starts to ramp up around rounds 3-4 (8 rounds total) where disasters are looming and become a factor that must be mitigated for. The analytics of prestige vs population are very well implemented and drive the games strategy. I love the whole, "take the lower of the two values as your  score", its brilliant and works to perfection in this game. The 7 expansions are a must if you enjoy the base as it adds great variability to the games different aspects. All in all, an excellent game I adore and worthy of being in almost any collection despite the very dry theme.

I absolutely love the way you score points; you need to balance your points as it’s the lowest of the two which constitutes your final score! This is a genius mechanism also known from Tigris & Euphrates, Ingenious etc. This is truly what makes the game interesting. The betting is also cool as you can screw each other a lot, so you need to be careful. I also very much enjoy the penalties of the disasters; I love when the game actively works against you and tries to whoop your ass (like the feeding in Agricola, the events in In the Year of the Dragon etc.)! I’ve only played it twice, with 2 and 5 players, and I actually think the game would work best with either 3 or 4… But it still worked well, although 2p was a little too loose and the bidding not particularly interesting. On the other hand, though, I do like the tiles which are available if you go on a conquest (at an increased price!), which aren’t part of the game when playing 5p. I don’t think the game will rise dramatically in my rating, because it’s just not a great game. Still, it’s quite good and I would usually be willing to play it.

Good euro civ game with bidding.  The bidding round is where the game is won or lost. It's quite an unforgiving game if one loses out on some tiles or is devastated by a disaster. This captures a medium euro in under 60 minutes and fills the time nicely with streamlined gameplay.

The theme is civilisation, it is not a civ game. It is a resource management auction game. There are eight auctions in the game. Often some players won't have enough cash to even bid for several of the items. There is often a big gap in the amount of money different players have. You also can't bid on some cards because you need symbols that match on a previous tile. If you are outbid you must move your bid to another tile but you can't change the bid amount so it will often be too low to play on several of the options. So basically the only interaction in the game is in the bidding and then the game just removes a lot of the interest from the bidding by often giving players few options that they can bid on. Oh yeah, and then events come along randomly to mess up your plans.

This game has knocked me off my feet. After one play I was smitten. This is one of the best games I have ever played. I love how the amount of decisions never changes, but the weight of each decision is huge. The disasters are always threatening your best laid plans and it just adds to the tension of trying to manage and grow your civilization. This game plays very quickly. The time/enjoyment ratio is wonderful!

Enjoying this so far but it is taking a backseat to the card game version for now.

RATING: 8
Mechanically solid, quick, beginner-friendly tile laying game, with a unique auction mechanism, and a Knizia-esque scoring regime. In each of the 8 rounds, there is 1 interesting decision to make, which tile to take and how much to bid for it. That's it, but it's pleasant and it's swift. It's also a game that benefits from repeat plays, and has a great solo version. In terms of quality of decisions though it's an efficiency game, so once you figure out how scoring works and the value in VP of each resource, the game runs mostly on autopilot. The disaster tiles add a source of luck, which depending on your point of view is welcome or unnecessary. The game works well for 2 players, which for auction games is rare, but shines with more. The art is uninspiring, albeit functional. The theme is quite thin, this is as much of a Civ game as Carcassonne is a city building one. One extra point for the very good solo mode.

Solid. I would play it again if suggested. Keeper.

Eh. It's ok, is about as excited as I can get about this. Not sure what the fuss is about. This got quite a bit of play. I played it a couple times, and I'm not really clammoring for more, but would certainly play if asked. Feels pretty typical to me. Start with a civ, which has (wait for it...) people, wood, wheat, stone. Build building to crank up your production, and provide other related benefits. Get new tiles to expand your civ via auction. The only really novel thing about the game that I could see is that in the auction, if you're outbid, you may change what you bid on (think Vegas Showdown, Amun Re bidding for multiple things), but you may NOT change your bid amount. So thinking about where you;re going to move your bid while keeping it the same if you're outbid is kinda nifty. Then toward the end, various disasters strike wreaking havoc to players' civs, which of course have a tile you can buy which protects against it. Box is way too big for what's inside. Kinda moot for many of us, since not distributed in USA anyway.

The games from publisher Iron Games always manage to attract my attention, but previous experiences in the past showed me that the offerings are usually high on not-quite-there-for-me-ness. There were many good stories about Peloponnes, though, and this prompted me to put the game on my Want to play-list.

The game turned out to be a simple affair of bidding together a 'civilization' consisting of landscape tiles giving you goods, and building tiles giving you people, money, and special abilities. Then there are a few disasters to provide the 'brake' on the players' engines. And since a good idea is better copied than imagined from scratch, there is also a Knizian 'highest lowest score wins', prompting a balanced approach between various paths... and also giving much more bite to some of the events. The game itself is really not all that special, but it [i]is[/i] flawless in execution, and is over in the amount of time one would expect it to be over. That lends Peloponnes a certain amount of charm and an aura of well-developedness: uncommon qualities.

The game lends itself very naturally to expansions, and I gather that a number exist already. While owning the game is a tad much I think (I already own several good auction games), playing Peloponnes anew on at least several occasions would certainly not be an Unwelcome Thing.

A civilization game as light as it can be, easy to explain and understand, that plays itself in less than an hour: This is just what Peloponnes has to offer and it´s a lot!
The tight bid and the randomness of the catastrophes, associated with the scoring system (the lesser out of two scores), makes it hard to plan much thing beforehand.
Of course you don´t get fulfilled, but this a nice game, nevertheless.

Interesting take on a mid-weight Civ theme. Essentially boils down to a bidding game, but each game can play out quite differently, based on the order that the disasters resolve. Fun to get beaten down. You will be cursing whatever god your civilization worships by the end. 

Update: I'm bummed a little that the best strategy is to get as much of one type of resource so that you produce luxury goods (which are much more versatile, even if you do pay 2:1 ratio).

Peloponnes is a fairly straightforward auction game that is fairly thematically tight. I’ve been curious about this one since Essen mostly because I am fascinated by games based on ancient Greece. The claims that it was a lighter sort of game kept me away, however, and I did not get to try it until this past month when a fellow BGGer who prefers the lighter sort of games introduced it to me. I was impressed enough that we played it four times in the session. 

The rules are fairly straightforward. Each player starts with a different city-state, each of which has a slightly different set of starting resources and resource(s) produced each round. Each turn the players use their money (produced by population) to bid on available tiles. Each tile has a minimum bid value, though players can bid higher than that minimum. The importance of doing so is based primarily on the fact that once you bid, you are unable to change your bid. If someone outbids you, you are allowed to move on to another tile for bidding, but only if you can either outbid an opponent or meet the minimum bidding requirement for the tile. Landscape tiles are simply added to the player’s board, though there are limitations on which such tiles can be acquired. Building tiles have to be paid for, usually with a combination of wood and stone. Periodically feeding rounds occur, where players must provide grain for their population. Six times over the course of the game a disaster will strike, requiring each player to either reduce one of their resources or pay resources or lose victory point supplying tiles. At the end of the game the lower of the player’s score from victory tiles and 3*population is their score and the highest score wins.

I liked and enjoyed Peloponnes but I fear that if I acquired it and played it at the rate I usually play games I like that I would quickly reach the point where I ran out of interesting things to find in the game. I am not sure if it would take one more play, five more plays, or ten more plays but I can tell it would happen fairly quickly. As such I am going to simply continue to play it exclusively when I am gaming with [username=eknauer]

Players each take a Greek city state tile, and develop it via constructing building tiles and adding land tiles.  Players on their turn have the option to claim a new tile and add it to their city, or roll out of the round and take some cash.  Tiles can be claimed by conquest (just take it at increased cost), or via a Amun-Re like push out auction mechanic.  Tiles taken give a one off increase to holdings, as well as turn by turn income.  Some building grant a power, such as protection against disasters.  Play over eight turns, feeding population and dealing with catastrophes along the way.  Best worst out of population vs prestige points wins the game.  Rock solid game - hard to find anything wrong with it.  Very impressed - 30 minutes tops for a two player game, but better and a little longer with more players.  Excellent.

8 cutthroat auctions with some weird income rules to slow the pace down. For a short wonky bidding game, Knizia has designed a dozen better games than this. Calling this a civ- style game is a grand delusion.

I was longing to own a quick civilization game. This game has been sitting on my wishlist for quite a while as the game was published by a small company (thus the high price). Had to made a special request to the FLGS and finally they brought it in.

The 15 minutes per player claim I think is pretty accurate here. So 5 players game can easily be played in just 75 minutes top. I was a little afraid in all simplicity, the game didn't capture the civilization feel. It wasn't a strong feeling but I can sense it's there.

You're trying to expand your starting city with wealth, power and technology. But all players need to be prepared for the 5 disaster (all 5 disasters are definitely going to happen!) that is coming. When a disaster has 3 tokens on it, then that disaster will strike. At the end of a turn, two disaster tokens will be revealed, so there's a little anxiety there to see which disaster is going to happen. These disaster are pretty badass themselves.

The scoring mechanic is quite interesting. You tally up points into two different groups. For the first group, you count all VPs that you get from building and land tiles, and also for every 3 silver coins you own, you can exchange that to 1 VPs. The second group, for each inhabitant that you still have, you gain 3 VPs each. Your final score will be whichever is the lowest between these two.

Now to find the sea expansion and 6th player components.

Bought extra and thick wooden circular disc to replace the cardstock player discs provided in the game.

Nice decision tree for the short play-time (45-60).     The random start tiles and random occurrence of disasters keep the game fresh.  Reminiscent of In the Year of the Dragon but doesn't feel as painful and unforgiving even though the disasters can be quite debilitating.

Quality execution.  (Worth adding some of the board enhancements in the BGG files section.)  Don't always think auction mechanics are great, but this one not only works with two, but also is structured to allow for an interesting approach (rather than bid more you win / less you lose sort of thing).  Excellent game.  More expansions pls.

[2 plays] The problem with this game is that it grinds to a crawl near the end, when everyone's best course of action becomes a solvable problem. The last random thing in the game is the order in which the two final disaster tokens come out--and I have certainly seen that determine the victory--but as there are only two possibilities, everyone can calculate their best moves in the last round for either case. This game might have been better with extra tiles to give it a little uncertainty and make perfect card-counting impossible.  As it is, it's otherwise too light a game to warrant the calculational morass into which it descends.

Civ-light game, 15-20 minutes per player.  Described as "Auction-based Civ building game. A tricky balancing act between enlarging your civilisation, increasing your population, and preserving as much as possible as disasters strike."  Some criticize it for having not enough decisions and too much book-keeping.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This game is notable for offering a nice depth-to-playtime ratio while accommodating 6P very well. I find I like it more with each play as building your civilization while navigating the disasters is quite a nice challenge. The highlight here is a step-auction with a nasty twist whereby you place your bid on a tile, but then if bumped you cannot change the amount of your bid before placing it on another tile. This means you often have to bid higher than you'd like just in case you get bumped so you have some leeway in bumping someone else.

The auction enables you to get land and building tiles to build up your civilization. As in many civilization games, you have to feed your people and there are natural disasters that happen semi-randomly (you get a sense of which are coming first). There's a spatial element to the tiles in that only like landscapes can touch, and everybody gets a unique start tile which gives them very different starting resources. The tiles come out randomly each game so it feels like there's a lot of replayability.

The beauty here is that you score, in a Knizia like way, the lower of your population x3 or your prestige points. So you can't just load up on building tiles (which give prestige points) and ignore your pop or vice versa. And your population is difficult to keep alive with all the feeding and disasters that happen. It's a real juggling act that I find enjoyable because I don't always know which way I'm going to end up scoring. It's not widely available but if it were, I think this game would have a better reputation. If you're thinking of getting it and can find a copy, I recommend it as a meaty but relatively short game for large groups.

A variation on the auction mechanics found in Outpost and Ra. I discovered both Outpost and Pelaponnes in roughly the same timeframe and while Peloponnes is a newer game with advancement in design and play time I am not a fan. I just found this to be a stale exercise.

With 2 plays so far, I am still deciding about this one.  Peloponnes seems a mostly enjoyable auction and light civ-building game with some creative concepts.  The auction mechanic can be brutal, as if you don't get what you want, you can be left with no choices.  I also got confused about the colors and bought a mountain land tile thinking it was a building tile.  Probably my own stupidity, but I thought the illustrations could have been a little clearer.

This is probably my favorite civilization game, full stop.  The player interaction is indirect, which I prefer, and the tension of the auction (both trying to figure out how much to bid, since you can't raise a bid even if you are outbid and have to move it, and what tile will best serve your needs as the disasters relentlessly advance on you) is amazing.

To cap it all off, the Knizia-style "score your worst of two categories" forces you to keep things balanced.  Pretty much everybody who's played this a few times has stories of amazing prosperity and calamitous implosion (usually massive population loss).

Peloponnes is a quick and fairly clean auction game. Like In the Year of the Dragon, a lot of it revolves around mitigating disasters and coping with the game trying to bring you down. The single bid auction mechanism makes sure that there is plenty of friction between players but in the end there are typically several alternatives available, and unrestrained growth typically isn't the way forward here, anyway.

Excellent bidding game.  I know there are many elements here that exist in other games but Peloppones is such a clean system and has just enough new things going in on it that in doesn't feel like a recycled game at all.  The auction stuff has been done before in games, but Peloppones makes the experience like a direct vein injection of bidding-game heroin and because of the disasters, tension is always present as you develop your city. There are just enough tweaks to the bidding system to create a decent amount of player interaction.  Other than the somewhat basic artwork and the somewhat high price given the basic components (though it is published by an independent, which explains the cost) I can't think of anything seriously negative to say about this game!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Peloponnes is a pretty fun game and you can play it solo. It's a game of balance where you try to gain population and prestige (for your civilization) by bidding on land and building tiles. At the end of the game, the lower of the victory points for prestige or population is your score. So you need to keep your population fed, but if you don't have enough food, they starve. If you don't bid on higher prestige tiles to keep a balance by the end of the game, you might have 60 victory points for a population, but only have 20 victory points for prestige. So your score ends up being 20 victory points. You're overpopulated and your civilization is unhappy.

The only place that might cause you grief is when someone bids a higher amount on a tile you really wanted. It might make someone mad at you depending on the players you're playing with. Other than that issue, you all have your own playing mat and do your own thing.

A light, quick play civilization building game - players bid for land and building tiles which add population, resources and special abilities. The game throws up several disasters and events that players must plan for. The winner is the player with the most balanced civilizalion having both population and land & buildings. The game is very accessible, turns are quick, and plays to a conclusion in less than 90 minutes even with 4/5 players however you effetively have just 8 decisions in the game and the rest is administration so it needs to be quick. Additionally the bidding process has a potential to be cut-throat if players want to be agressive which can shut another player out of one or more of those very limited number of turns. Components are good quality and the art is nice even though a bit muted. Good solo variant rules are included as a bonus.

Played at Essen and immediately bought a copy. The bidding system works well - overbidding isn't too badly punished in the short term, but can hurt over the long haul. Which sounds about right.

Opinion: ok game, probably due to a first game, but there are some things in the game for which I could not find the click in the game. The game flows easy, you bid on tiles, place them on your display, receive income and face the disasters, some times during the game you have a supply phase where you have to feed your workers and pay any building you could not afford before. The way you place your terrain tiles is ok, with that domino style, but the bid for the tiles is missing something I could not say. Then the resource gathering is also something I saw not "clicked", you have 3 type of resources, and when you reach the maximum you start gathering luxuries, which you can exchange 2 to 1.
Ok, the game is not a heavy one, but I missed any tension during the game, you only have to focus on the bid, if you manage this right you are the winner, no tension with the resources.... getting lot of some will provide you what you need. So, after a first play, my impressions are that you can only focus on workers and food, and you will be there on the scoring. In the game was a bit weird the scoring system, I like part of it, you sum your workers 3 times, and your buildings plus money divided by 3, the minor of these is your scoring. With the buildings played (all of them are played) it is very strange to have more points in workers than in buildings, unless you do it very bad on buildings, so, although the system is nice, something is missing there.
I will play the game if it comes to the table, but seems that not a game to come into my colelction

RATING: 8
Peloponnes feels to me like a super-streamlined distillation of elements from the Outpost family of games (Outpost, Zepter von Zavandor, Phoenicia). It's almost like a streamlined Phoenicia, which was itself a streamlined Outpost. Phoenicia didn't work for me. It felt too lengthy and ponderous in comparison to its strategic depth. Peloponnes is a shorter and less serious game, and for me it's much more exciting. The bidding method is an ingenious twist on the Evo/Amun-Re system. A player who is outbid can move his entire bid to another item, but can never change the amount of the initial bid. This creates some interesting decisions of valuation and prediction, while keeping the pace nice and snappy.

Central to Peloponnes are the disasters, which are inevitable but difficult to forecast. They can be crippling if you are unprepared, or if you're wrong about when they're going to happen. Without these disasters, Peloponnes would be an uninteresting game. A game about building a very simple economic engine needs an element of anxiety, to keep it from becoming predictable, or even solvable.

I tried the solo gauntlet once; don't think it's worth repeating. Scores were 31, 16 (fail), 29, 35, 35, 36 for the escalating five rounds.

[Nov 09] [Rating: 8]
Peloponnes is a bidding game disguised in a civilization theme and it’s actually pretty good. In the game every player starts out with one civilization with its own strengths. Each turn a few tiles are placed up on the table and people are able to bid for those tiles, which are either buildings or landscapes. Each tile gives special abilities, points and/or income, which makes you competitive. There are mainly two threats to your civilization and that is five disasters which will come during the game and three feeding phases which can be pretty brutal. You win by points that are either summed up by your population at the end of the game or a combination of points from buildings, lands and coins.

I have played it three times now and I have seen a few different strategies. It looks at first to be a pretty shallow, but the game has a few nuances. I think I played all three games with three other players and I think it worked pretty well and especially it was fun doing it.

RATING: 4.5
Something like a gemstone in the rough. It just needed a bit more playtesting to ensure the necessary balancing. Right now, some tiles are stronger than others. Furthermore most of the time when choosing a tile to bid on, because of the restrictions there is only one left which is usable. Therefore there are not really many options to choose when your obliged to take a specific one. I don't like games where I am played instead of I play. The complex iconography (one icon in each corner of the tile) doesn't make it better. All in all the game is not bad, but just average. Rating after one 3player game.

A great, fast, simplified civ building game. The rules are very straightforward, and it plays quickly. Players bid for advancements to their civilizations (randomly drawn, which consist of either buildings or resources). As they increase the value of their city, they also increase the cost of upkeep. One neat feature is the five disasters that absolutely *will* occur during the course of the game. Depending on the timing, they can be devastating.

Pretty good light civ game with several different ways to get victory...  Not bad at all but not really meaty enough to scratch a full civ itch. The theme is a little too abstracted.  It is very dry and the whole game is just a series of auctions of tiles which provide different resources which you are trying to manage.  Not a bad game but nothing I would want to play more than once a year or so. 

Update: played a second time and was burned by the endgame when you have to feed twice without collocting income.  This is such a bummer I consider it a design flaw.

After one play, I could immediately see the value in a civilization-type game with only a small number of decisions.  (Basically, 8 auctions and you're done!)  The game only takes about an hour when you know what you're doing, and has little capricious randomness, which blows Tempus out of the water.  But I'm not sure that I like this game; I'll need more plays to decide.

The auction mechanism is really clunky and unfair -- if there is a wide variety of tiles up for offer, you can get screwed very easily.  For example, if there's one clearly great tile, and you bid a large value for it, someone could outbid you, and you still have to pay your large bid for some clearly lesser tile, or go home with no tile but keep your bid (plus one).  This is far from an efficient market.

It's very important to have enough people.  By the end of the game, if you don't have enough people, your score will be limited.  I think this would tend to overvalue the tiles that give you extra people, and those that save you from the plague or from the famine.

Great for solo play. I haven't gotten around to playing with multiple people, not sure whether it's that awesome there - the auction mechanics don't even exist in the solo game, and are quite central to more players, so I can't really judge the experience with more players. But the disasters and whatnot make the game intriguing and challenging to repeatedly play solo.

The strict and rather dry presentation, the elegant and focused gameplay, the mild colours. Everything contrasts very well with the brutal events of this game. People die from plague in huge numbers, houses get detroyed in earthquakes, crops vanish in tempests. And it is your job to build a civilization sturdy enough to survive all this.

It takes a few plays to fully form a strategy that works, but this is a great game, also for solo play.

Good civ-lite game. You buy building and land tiles to expand your civ and try to avoid the disasters if you can. Your final score is the lowest between civilization points from your civ and population points from your people so you need to try to balance these to win.

Played once with my wife, once with 4 friends.
Everytime I hated the game !
The auction style and buying restrictions are awful and frustating. If you lose your bidding, you can't go bidding on one other tile !!!!!
And you're limited on your auctions choice by your last tile on your board !

too many restrictions and if my bidding is lost, I just watch the rest of the turn processing automatically.
No fun at all.

A light civilization game, comfortably playable in an hour. Simple bidding for some fairly bland landscape and building tiles which may protect you against the inevitable calamities or just provide a bigger liability. Competent enough, but no sense of competing strategies. Perhaps the ultimate development of the 'Civ lite' game.

At first glance, this seems to be just another game in which you use resources to buy tiles that in give you VPs and more resources to buy more tiles. And, like Agricola and Through the Ages, there is tough challenge in periodically having to "feed your people." But three things set this apart from many similar games: (1) player interaction via an awesomely vicious auction mechanic that is used to buy the tiles, (2) a Tigris-esque mechanic in which you score is the *lower* of either your VP total or 3 times your population, and (3) a dose of luck in the timing of the disasters and the "feed your people" phases that help prevent gameplay from becoming too dry and calculating.

This is rather a good civ building game.  Looking at the components, and listening to the explanation, I was concerned that it would be a bit souless.  But, I rather enjoyed the disaster mechanism and the way bidding functions is quite clever.

A little more graphical umph, and this game could draw some real attention.  As it stands, folks should be on the lookout for it.

I can see this becoming an 8 without much difficulty.

Nice, tight, simultaneous auction game. Depending on the disasters, it can have a fairly brutal economy. Mostly I'm impressed with how well it handles its player count range...I've actually enjoyed games with 2 players all the way up to games with 6 players (w/expansion). I honestly don't know that I have another game in my collection that's as versatile in that regard.

Great combination of licitation, damage control (disasters) and develop-your-civ-with-tiles game.  I didn't expect the 'wow' effect completely, but there it is...

Roll Through the Ages without the "roll."  Fun, quick but very engaging and somewhat thinky.  I have been playing it on the iPad and am completely hooked.  Lots of variety.  Downright addictive.  While some have said there are only "8 decisions per game," that misses how multifaceted those decisions are (the amount of a bid affects what you can do if outbid and also turn order for the next round; disaster chits create a press-your-luck component that needs to be taken into account; whether to build immediately or not impacts future options, etc.).  There's a lot going on, with numerous paths to victory, many interrelated factors, a Knizia-like lowest-of-two-scores victory condition, and yet it all works in smooth and non-fiddly gameplay.  The very definition of boardgame elegance.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (July 2014)

Ok game. I was expecting a better game so I’m a bit disappointed. Peloponnes is a relatively simple game. Its main virtue is its short playtime. I also like the one round bidding (a la Cyclades/Evo) BUT you cannot change the initial bid. Due to this, here is the phase in which most of the interesting action happens. As you can see, the game is not very deep. The other interesting bits are the disasters. You have to plan for them or they can undo you.

The theme is cool, but I don’t feel it as much as I wanted to. The coins were depleted in our game, not sure if this happens often or not. The art and components are ok. The English edition has some rules mistakes but you can see the errata here on BGG.

I’m interested in trying the solo challenge on the iPad, not in real life as I’m no solo player.

Bottom line, I’m disappointed. Peloponnes is an ok bidding game, but it was a very expensive game for what it offered (I was expecting a meatier/heavier game). I will play it a lot in the coming months to see if I keep my copy or not but if I do sell it I’m pretty sure it will be with a huge loss.

After more plays, I decided to sell it. It is an ok game but it fails to really excite me (way too light). Peloponnes is almost exclusively a bidding game, all the other phases are merely for bookkeeping. In my last comment I forgot to talk about the scoring system. I like it and if feels Knizian.

Civ theme is always a nice touch - though it's just a touch heavy-handed.

The one-bid auction forces some tough decisions especially for early players in the turn order.  Unfortunately it's too easy to get oneself into a position where only 2-3 tiles can be legally placed, leaving little margin for error.

Disaster mechanic is also well implemented, I think - you know all will happen eventually but the timing can have a dramatic game effect.  For a game this short I think that's fine.

Purchased Essen 2009. Played once in the hotel room, but need to play again (after re-reading rules) to form an opinion - first impressions were good though. Update: Played three more times (back-to-back(!)) and still liked it. Initial rating set to 7.5, if I can learn to plan better for the disasters and the final supply round it might go up.  ;)

Update:
Rating increased to 8, could go up further. Really like it - quick to play and still enough things to think about.

Update: Increased rating to 9, this is turning into one of my favourites from the Essen 2009 crop.

Peloponnes pays tribute to Reiner Knizia, and to Ra, specifically. Does it stand on its own?

Mostly. What we've got here is a snappy, 8 turn game that lightly evokes the rise of ancient civilizations. All auction, all the time, with some basic resource gathering thrown in. At the start of the round, five tiles are revealed for bidding. These come in two types: city tiles (typically worth more points), and country tiles that produce stone, wood, and grain. The city tiles typically have a resource cost in addition to the winning bid, but players can delay paying that cost by tying up some cash. Country tiles are subject to placement restrictions. The auction itself is quite unusual. In turn order, players will allocate a single bid, observing the minimum price listed on the tile. Another player can overbid the tile, at which point the original player can move, but not raise their bid to another eligible tile. This makes Peloponnes a discrete-value, single bid game just like Ra, but players get to select the value of their bid and may have the option of winning a different lot.

So far I have described the more typical half of Peloponnes: expand your production-base, leverage it to purchase victory points. Not nearly enough Knizia.

:D

Let's go over the second half. As players expand their civilization, their population grows, and this growth is actually a much more effective means to score. The catch, though, is that only the lowest of these two scoring paths (population growth and tile expansion) will count at the end of the game. As the end approaches, it becomes increasingly difficult to support a large population, so players must plan carefully or lose big in the home stretch. The game also features periodic disasters (just like Ra). The mechanic for this gives players some advance notice about when the disasters are likely to resolve, which will not only reward planning, but also add a bit of variability to the game's narrative arc and lend the occasional X-factor to the auctions, as some of the city-tiles protect against specific disasters.

All in all, a complete package, one that I would happily play a few more times to see where it takes me. I'm not sure Ra is the game that this wants to be competing with - because frankly, it can't - but there's a good alternative here nonetheless.

Auction game with a civ-theme but a good and quick one. It could as well have been an economic game if it weren't for the disasters which bring in civilization flavour. The need to balance your achievements on two axis (population, developments) reminds of Knizia's scoring mechanisms. A solid entry into the light gamers' games that could have used better graphics. The production is good though for a small publisher.

I've only played it once, but I really feel that you should be able to choose your starting tile instead of it being randomly dealt to you.

I rather liked this as a Civ lite. Didn't feel at all like multiplayer solitaire like I was fearing due to the low number of actions each player gets to take, there was surprisingly much interaction on the "bidding". I but the word in scare quotes, since the auction game hater that was in on one of the games said it didn't actually feel at all like an auction.

RATING: 8
Thematically boring, but mechanically solid.  Peloponnes is certainly lacking in innovation, and is overpriced for the components, but gives a good game experience in a relatively short playing time.

The rules, once initially digested, are fairly straightforward and the auctions are definitely very interesting.  The disasters make the game unpredictable and fun.  I look forward to playing this one some more!

Hated my first play.  Played with 3 players.  I bid for a Rock, got it and thereafter couldn't get any food (nothing fits with this terrain).  Pretty much lost 90% of my civilization when feeding time came.  Hated the bidding mechanism.  Everyone felt the same at the table about the game.

First impression - seems worthy!  First game wasn't all that swift, but it seems likely to be a quick game now that we know how to play.

We made a couple errors.  We paid for buildings with a coin on them too quickly, must wait for a supply round.  And we omitted the income step in the final turn, due to the rules being a bit terse and ambiguous.

I have ordered the 1st expansion, the Hellas expansion and the new Goat expansion.  Guess I should try to track down the Athens mini expansion now.

EDIT: I have raised my rating to an 8.  This game is holding up very well, and seems to be gaining some fans around here.

This game collapsed for me under the weight of the multiple expansions.  I couldn't remember how to set it up, or how to descramble the expansions easily enough.  So I jettisoned the whole thing.

RATING: 6
Excellent, light civ building game with a unique auction as the central mechanism around which how you develop your city state and spread.  Each city state has a unique starting pool of resources which creates some interesting replay possibilities as well.  In the central auction, you must consider what you bid as you can never add to your bid if you are forced out of the tile you initially pursue.  You score two separate sets - one is building/property value + money and the other is population x3 and your score is the lesser of the two.  Disasters thrown into the mix will occur and you will need to plan for them accordingly!  Some of the disasters are very brutal.  Another aspect of the game which I liked was that you could "rent" a building in that if you didn't have the resources to build it when you bought it in auction, you could still buy it, use it, and try to gear up to build it when the supply round hits (there are two supply round tiles).  If you cannot build it during the supply phase when that occurs, you lose the building.

I'm thinking the key might be to focus on acquiring two of the three resources (one of which should likely be wheat).  This will more likely give you a bunch of luxury goods which can be used to cover needs in case of emergency or supply.  A balanced setup does not seem to get rewarded many times.

Solo option might be enjoyable the first couple times, but I believe would get stale quickly.  This is an auction game at it's heart so it needs 3-6 people to make it most enjoyable.

I reduced the rating by one to a 7.  I just don't find that I enjoy this one as much.  

I haven't been pulling this one out to play and have little interest indoing so.  Too little replay value at this point for me.  Rating reduced to 6 and game sold.

A successful attempt to design a civ-game that plays in an hour or even less while still delivering the civ-feeling. Of course, it cannot deliver the civ feel of civilization or one of the other longer civ games, and it is very strategic and indeed its only 8 decisions to be made. But for that, it is very good!

It is in the same niche as 7 Wonders, and in my opinion it does a better job. The only aspect on which I think 7W is better is that it succeeds in implementing a simple but interesting military aspect, which is completely missing in Peloponnes.

I like the fact that the game goes by fast but for a game like this, I kind of prefer Homesteaders more. I can see that there is a slight element of luck here in that you cannot really control the auction phase, which isn't really much of an auction as you get completely kicked out if you lose; at least in Cyclades, there is always another good choice out there, in this game you only get more coins which don't really help you much. It's an interesting game but not one I would play often.

While the rule book could be better written, the production could be a bit better, and the game plays a little clunky, at the end of the day it's a decent game that doesn't over stay its welcome. The disasters may be harsh, but they can be managed, even avoided in some cases.

At this point I've played it twice and missed some small but important rule. Third time's a charm!

Update: I've played this game three different times, with eight different people, and so far I'm the only one interested in playing it again. It falls flat for nearly everyone.

Played this solo and 2 player. I really like the solo and how it has varying difficulties. Though I don't play solo games much nor do I really prefer them but I do like to give it a try and this game does it well. 2 player is good especially for it being a auction game. In this game you have 2 scores and at the end your lower score is what is used for determining the winner. I like this because it makes you spread out in the different areas. One issue I do have is at the very end if for what ever reason you where not fully prepared or as prepared as your opponent for the final disasters then it can cost you the game even if you where the clear leader the whole game. One small complaint with the components I wish there was stickers or miniatures to represent the different players like Romans, Grecian and Egyptians again small issue easy fix and I think would add to the theme.

I was very surprised by this game.  Rated after one play, but am pretty sure that my rating won't drop by much.  I sat down determined to hate it:  It's a civ-type game (groan), lots of mysterious symbols (too much work), and the only player interaction is an auction?  Lovely.  Can I just go watch Saw XVII instead??  However, I ended up liking it because when bad things happen, they happen to everyone and it seems like we all get equally hosed in this game, providing a sense that maybe you can get ahead after all.  Over several more plays, that may ultimately turn out to be a false sense of hope, but I'm gonna enjoy it while it lasts!

I like this game.  It scratches the civ lite itch just fine.  Given that there are only eight decisions to make, it is surprising how deep this can feel as four players stew over those few decisions.  There's some push your luck stuff going on as in, "I can take this sweet building but if a supply tile comes up next turn I will be hosed, dare I or don't I." And there's a little take that, as in, "The first bidder just has enough money for that one tile, if I out bid him he won't get a tile this round and is probably screwed." Like it best with all the expansions.

A really surprisingly good civ-building game in around an hour. Much of this is down to the economy of components. The tile auction works well and I much prefer it to the take-a-card-pass-your-hand stylings of 7 Wonders. 7 Wonders is a good game, but this is better and more meaty.

Good economic euro with an ancient civ-lite theme. 

Passed on it first time around: same old boring 'ancient' cover, artwork functional but dull, but after playing it at a geekbuddy I found out there's a neat game under the hood. Basically a cube pusher, but for some reason it doesn't bother me, since the various tiles seem to make sense.

What's special about this one is that it's pretty quick. I guess it's playable in 45 minutes. 

Solo game works well too. And since the expansions make it playable up to 7 players this one could always be an option to get on the table.

[microbadge=1714]

[u]21-Jan-2014[/u]: This is a fantastic auction, tile-laying game for one or more players.  Each player controls one of the ancient civilizations of Greece and through bidding on new landscape and building tiles each round tries to build the "best" civilization.  To be successful, you will need to balance your resources while maintaining and growing your population.  Along the way, several disasters will affect all civilizations with their own form of nastiness.  Good preparation is required to withstand these events and remain the strongest of the civilizations.

I liken this to Agricola but quicker and less fiddly.  Okay, and with an auction mechanism instead of worker placement but still.  It provides a similar feel and challenge to 'Gric but in a smaller time frame and footprint.  Very much recommended for solo and multiplayer.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Decent little civ-builder game where you need to buy tiles, generate resources and try to overcome event tiles.  There have been a number of these games lately and this one seemed to work pretty good although their is quite a bit of randomness with the tile draws... at the same time though I suppose it would get pretty boring if the game was too deterministic.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Entertaining 'civ' filler that is basically an eight round auction game.  auction mechanics present a bit of a twist since players cannot adjust their bid if outbid, but can slide their bid over to another tile where their bid exceeds the minimum bid.

I think this game suffers very much from misguided expectations.  The various civ-lite attempts to capture the greatness that is Tresham's Civilization in a 60-90minute (or less) is fool's gold.  Peloponnes is not a civ game, not a civ-lite game, it is an auction filler game - and an interesting one at that.

Just about everything I look for in a game (with the expansions): Easily identifiable at-a-glance game state, diverse player count that maintains a very similar play experience for any number, manageable game length, tough decisions to decide (but very easy to execute) every turn, no need for hidden player information, enough hidden variables to keep the experience lively. Highly recommended.

This could easily be mistaken to be 7 Wonders: The Auction Game. That alone will tell you if you'll like this or not. I do feel, however, that this game needs more players, otherwise it can be a fairly solitary auction game with little competition at times. I like the game, but I guess it's just missing that oomph to push it over the top for me. Still, this is probably my favorite game that utilizes the Vegas Showdown-style of auction. Really could have benefited from a better production though. I would have included a single board to track everyone's resources instead of the bulky player boards, as well as making the box smaller.

In this Roman themed game you bid on available tiles using a number of coins, and the minimum required to bid is printed on the tiles. You are bidding for buildings or land. The trick is when someone ouotbids you, you have to move your bid to another tile, much like the mechanism used in Amun-Re, designed by Reiner Knizia. You do this over 7 rounds. You will be accumulating population, which you have to feed at certain points in the game with grain, and you also have wood and stone as resouces to construct your buildings. At the end of the game, your score will be the lower of three times your population or the VPs on your building/land. Now there are 5 disasters that can get triggered when 3 tokens of that disaster are drawn (each round you draw 2 of them). For instance, a earthquake destroys buildings, unless you have wood and stone for each building.

It's a dry exercise bidding each round, then a disaster might randomly happen or not. It's a bit dull. It's like the designer studied Knizia's games, then decided to use his Amun Re bidding mechanic, modified to play worse, then put in scoring influenced by Knizia again, but again, it's not that interesting. I only played once, but could be talked into a game again. Perhaps it plays well as a 2 player game, and not a five player game.

Eight fairly straightforward auction rounds and some table-wide screwage.  Not bad, but not exactly bursting with excitement either.  Don't expect a civ-lite game.  That's not the sort of thing that Peloponnes really sets out to accomplish.

Yet another take on what's being called a Civ-lite game, but one that has a lot to like. With only one play, I can't judge how or if each game will feel different enough, but I enjoyed the well-conceived rules. The production is also very nice - much better than I was led to believe reading some of the comments on the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A nice civilisation building bidding game. Clever mechanism of bidding means that the player who paid the most goes first next turn meaning they can be "bumped" from their chosen tile spot.

Have to balance the two sides of you civilisation (people & buildings) to win as it is the lowest of those two scores that is your final score.

RATING: 8
just swell. I first played this about 3 years ago and embarrassed my ass off, discovering midway through the game that I had built illegally early on, thus nullifying my results (and possibly others') and risking possible banishment from my then-new-to-me game group. And so I haven't been keen to play it again since. But I'm glad I did. The game moves at a fast clip with high play counts (we played with six this last time): an interactive auction followed by simultaneous upkeep phases. It feels quite variable and has an appealing weight-to-game-length ratio.

It's a civilization game that even I'm willing to play almost any time because of short length. The game is rather abstract but what can you really expect from a game where you make just 8 real decisions during the game... There is still surprisingly lot to think about during the game.

An oddball valuation/bidding exercise with some deeply annoying disasters, and it's a moot point whether the designer intended the disasters to be an actively destructive portion of the game: certainly with the probability skewing trigger-when-you-draw-the-third tile mechanic, that's the way it turns out.

Too little control, says my vote, although it's fun and short enough to enjoy from time to time.

The game is to bid for a new tile in each of 8 turns - mostly either a revenue earning land tile or a VP earning building tile with a special power. Add it to your civ. Turn over the 2 disasters for this round and watch as the only disaster you haven't been able to get the necessary protection for is the one that gets revealed, turning your collection into crumbling dust, while you then watch the rich get richer. Hilarious if you can find it so, especially for a shortish game. But it may prove difficult to get players back to the table, knowing that situations will occur early in the game in that if this disaster comes out, player A will be effectively knocked out, and if this other disaster comes out, Player B will be effectively knocked out. Maybe we're just completely messing up the bidding, but it seems that important and that random. Getting replay may prove difficult given it's happened both games so far, but I still feel I'd like to explore what may be an interesting game that moves quickly.

RATING: 9
"Light civ theme, with super-clever once-around auctions. Scales extremely well, from 1 to 6+ (with expansions). Too bad it's so rare in the US."

What I like:
- Plays quickly, even with 6 (w/expansion)
- Each decision is very meaningful
- No attacks, and the auctions rarely get vicious
- Super-clever modified once-around auction format
- Lots of variability with tile and disaster sequence
- Plays well solo

What I don't like:
- Player mats are a bit clumsy (and are thin in some editions)
- Hard to get in the US; can be expensive

I was impressed that two 6p games, where 3-4 of us had never played, only took 90-100 minutes. A 4p game with one newbie took 70. Solo games can take 15-30 minutes.

In addition to 16+ plays of the cardboard version, I probably played over 100 on my computer. It has held up well, and it still challenges me. 

I think it is a bit heavier than the BGG weight of 2.4, so I'll say 2.6.

Expansions: I definitely like that some of them add more players, and would not fear playing with 8p. I think the sea tiles only make sense at higher player counts, and I haven't tried the goats, trade tiles, or Athens. I'm not fond of the "D" round in the Hellas expansion (it feels both swingy and punishing).

Although Bernd is my friend, this is no shill-vote. Ive playtested a lot of his games (and developed two with him) but I believe this is his best design. In the process of 4 (?) years he really eliminated all weak points and made a incredible balanced, elegant game. 
Some people might critize that the player interaction is limited to the bidding, but thats nasty enough (especially with 4 or 5 players) and it doesnt bother me anyway.

A short developmentgame. I still have to play it more to either highten or lower my rating.
Update: It feels a little straightforeward with some limiting choices. To get grain is so very important, that all the rest isn't that important. Difficult to decide on my final vote. Still it is fun with the right bunch of people. Will play this more. :-)
Update: Have bought the Hellas-expansion and found it impossible to play the game without getting the full income in the last round! So I checked out the errata and horray, yes, we played it wrong, because the german rules aren't very clear in the first place. Now everything makes much more sense. Will have to see how this influences the rating of this game!
Update: This game has stand the test of time in my collection. A wonderful game that I can play with up to 6 persons. Very recommended.

RATING: 7
This is an auction game where players are bidding on a number of tiles at the same time--each player will get at most one tile.  Tiles will help you expand your city's production, help you avoid catastrophes, or just get you more victory points.  The auction is particularly rough though, as if you're outbid on a given tile, you can switch your bid to another tile, but you can't change your bid.  Due to building costs and placement restrictions, there may be some tiles you're unable to place, and if you're outbid and can't bid on anything else, you basically just lose your turn.  This is pretty harsh, but I need to play more to see how it really affects gameplay.

A quick civilization game that can be played withing an hour. The auction mechanism is well done and it can be good even with two players.

pretty good ancient building game that was probably even cooler in 2009.  not a ton of originality here, but it plays very well.  like most such games, you need a play a few times to get a feeling for what is valuable.  in particularly, lots of planning helps overcome the disaster.  the end-game scoring is not exactly unique (think Knizia), but at least uncommon:  there are two main ways to collect points, but you're only as good as the lesser of these.

This game is an absolute masterpiece !! Very underrated here on BGG.

This a light-medium weight auction/civilization game that makes everything works perfectly fine together.

The rules are simple to learn, but oh so hard to master. It is way deeper than it looks like at first glance because there are just so many options to choose from and to manage. The need to feed your population and the management of disasters are what makes this game arise above the rest of the genre. The auction mechanic is also pretty neat and dictates the flow of the game.

On top of that, the length of the game is just perfect. Varies between 60 to 90 minutes, no matter the number of players, which is a big plus !!

Get this game while it is still available, it is a must in all collection. Absolutely magnificent civilization game.

This game has the appearance of a dull bidding and tile placement game, but with a few plays it starts to grow on you. The game plays very quickly even up to 5 or 6 players. You bid on a tile, and if you get outbid you can move your bid (without changing the amount) to another tile your money can legally afford. Then you add the tile you won to your board, and it creates some payouts for you. Fine. The thing that makes this game special are the disasters, which slowly creep up on you and can take down your score a lot if you aren't prepared, and then the way the scoring works where you get the lower score of two categories. There aren't many 6 player games that can play smoothly and quickly like this, and the game works just as well with 2.

Great game. Works well as a gateway, despite the nasty catastrophes that can seriously wreck one's game, yet is deep enough for serious playing. With just 8 turns the game is also very fast to play, but one could still build rather interesting stories around the events in the game making it an ultra-light civilization experience. Support for six players is also awesome.

My only problem with the game is currently that the different civilizations don't seem particularly balanced.

More of the same but very well executed civilization building game. Build tiles, lay them onto your playing field, gather resources, continue from step 1 for 9 nine rounds. Works very nice and the bidding mechanic is neat because once you bid you cannot increase the bid, only change where it goes, quite ingenious I might say. Good balance and the disasters add more flavour, so do the sea tiles from the expansion. I found the building rules (you can use them even if unbuild) very confusing and I think they should have changed that during playtesting. One of my favourite Euros (after 1 play that is)

This game is a nice fast civilization game with auction mechanism where if you are outbid you may, if possible, place your bid, in same amount, for a different item.
As a player you are trying to build a city and to measure up your success there are two ways of calculating your greatness, in population and in wealth. The lowest score of the two is your final score.

Not hard to play and I am looking forward playing this one again.

Euro-engine game with the auction mechanism from Evo.

Not my kind of game, but it's so quick and fast! Hardly any interaction; the only interaction is in the auction mechanism, and that isn't as aggressive as Evo because (a) there are certain tiles you can't even use and (b) you can get certain tiles uncontested for a premium.

RATING: 6.5
Played it once, pre-Essen.  Overall I thought that it was quite good, but a long way from being great.

It's quite hard to keep a close eye on the track positions of other players, which makes it hard to check that everyone is applying the various rules on income and disasters correctly.  It also felt a little dry to me.  However, it has a reasonable amount of tension or angst.

Although it is mechanically similar to Evo in one respect, the game it reminded me of most of all was In The Year Of The Dragon.  Final scoring is going to be greatly affected by how you are affected by the disasters, and it almost pays to build up *knowing* that you're going to lose certain items when the disasters turn up.

Unfortunately, that's not something I particularly enjoy.

Peloponnes reminds me of Roll Through the Ages, but it has more substance than Roll Through the Ages.  The building and terrain tiles help add a lot of the flavor that checkmarks in boxes can't add.  The auction mechanic is also new and interesting.  I can't think of any other game that has players bid a certain amount of money for one tile and then if they are overbid, they have to switch to a new auction without changing the bid.  It's kind of crazy, but it gives the game a different flavor than any other auction type game I've played.  The disaster mechanic is neat and an interesting idea but the disasters don't seem to hurt as much as they seem like they would.

Obra interessante, que parece mais complicada do que é, mas que faz os jogadores sentirem-se miseráveis, pois nunca têm o dinheiro necessário para o tile que desejam.

Ainda bem que há uma infinidade de expansões, pois em Peloponnes, os jogos acabam sempre cedo de mais...

I've only played this solo so I have not had the unique experience of the auctioning in this game.  However, as solo game this is a nice, clean, quick but tough civ-game.  There is really a good mix of resource and income management while building your civilization and trying to balance this with all the disasters and feeding frenzies during and at the end of the game is just very interesting and entertaining as a solo game. I'm quite eager to play this with more players to include the auction mechanic within this game.

+ interesting bidding mechanic
+ quick to explain and play: accessible game
+ different approaches are possible, yet the end game scoring rules force players to play in a balanced way
+ original gameplay

- some luck dependence in tile draws
- game does not seem to develop in an 'exciting' way, it feels a little dry and without a real sense of purpose and direction, maybe due to the end game scoring rules? Maybe this is due to a lack in experience?
- I don't really like some 'boundery conditions' in the game: making a row with likewise materials (like domino), etc. They feel a bit too restraining...

A quick playing resource management game where you build up your civ-lite city hoping to survive the disasters and the other opponents.  And one where the resources are sufficiently tight that at some point, something will have to give.  Being highly efficient where no resources are wasted is the key...so need to plan ahead nicely against the tile draws.

I loved how the market offers a new take on how to valuate your bids in the context of the other tiles up for sale.

There is some randomness, especially resulting from the build restriction on terrain.  Not sure hot to fix it, but it can produce occasional games where some players have almost no choices.  I still enjoy it a lot, but allowing a high cost way to break the terrain restriction would make it even better.  Perhaps 1 pop + 1 silver to break the rule.

For 2 players, the game kind of plays by itself.  You know what you need to get to feed the people, to get the resources etc.  There's enough good tiles to buy each time so bidding doesn't create any contention.

--Oct2010-- After two games, it appears to be a very interesting optimization problem with a bunch of potential constraints.   On the good side, the bidding mechanism encourages a not-insubstantial degree of interplayer screwage, and the balance of future risk versus reward ensures that there are always messy decisions to be made.  I like it; looking forward to trying an expansion or two.

Excellent game that comes in well under an hour with only eight turns (or nine when playing with the expansion). That doesn't sound like a lot, but there's plenty of games out there that have less decision making and last twice as long. The rules are simple, but the decisions are tough. Essentially you're bidding for either field or buildings that will reap you people, money, resources, disaster protection and any combination thereof.

Nice stuff and the expansions offering sea tiles, more buildings and land, and sixth player capability, complement it nicely. I like the simplicity, the tough decisions and it gets a solid place in the ratings from me because it plays nicely at both ends of the player scale - solo and with six. It's weakest with two players and probably isn't for everyone, but if you like auction games that come in a smaller sized box, play fast and are simple to teach and learn, then this is an excellent game.

RATING: 6
Auction game in which players acquire buildings and lands in order to improve their civilization.  Normally, games of this type are about creating a machine that gives victory points to players, but this is not.  Most tiles that players buy in auction, almost all of them by the way, only give them some income and fixed points for the end scoring, so things are bought on their value and not as part of something greater.  This makes the game a tactic one instead of a strategic one, leaving the feeling of simplicity.  Besides, the scoring system feels odd and prevent any chance of strategy, leaving the players in the simple choice of improve population or getting building points instead, cause the players' score will be the lowest between them.  Finally, we played [i]Homesteaders[/i] the same night that we played this one, which is almost the same game in mechanics, but way deeper, so the comparaison contributed to low its ranking.

RATING: 8.5
Players form Greek city states, increasing their population and acquiring assets (buildings, land, money). They get VP separately for both categories. The LESSER of the two VP totals is their final score, so having a high population but low VP for assets gives you a low score. This balancing act, along with the necessity of feeding your people regularly, coping with five disasters, and facing competition over property assets leads to a really nice light civilization game. About the only biggies missing are combat and a tech tree, but that's OK -- for what it is, I really enjoy it.

Playing well means planning ahead. The end game is especially brutal, with two disasters and a feeding coming due, so don't fret if you're behind, the more you have, the more you have to lose! The bidding system for properties is also lovely: you can skip the auction completely and take 3 gold, make a bid for at least the minimum bid price on one of the property tiles, or "bump" an opponent's bid with a higher bid (they are forced to withdraw their bid for a measly 1 gold consolation, or move their bid to another tile which could cause another bump). Because you cannot raise your bid when bumped, players are more likely to bid high to ensure they have enough to get their secondary pick (which may have a higher min price) in case they get bumped. Makes for a quick auction. High bidders then become first in the player order, which is another clever mechanic.

I'm a sucker for civ games, especially ones that can be played in under an hour. Quite fun.

The difficulty of the solo game jumps massively in going from level 4 to level 5. I'm not sure how many times I'll want to play it solo, but it works pretty well that way. 

I tried it with 2, and it worked alright, but I'd like to try it with 3 or 4. That way there would be more options available without having to go to the conquer row. 

This game is surprisingly meaty for a game with essentially 8 decisions over the course of the game.

A fun tile-laying game with a cool bidding mechanic where what you bid cannot be changed.  If you get overbid, you can bid on something else with the same bid.  Something about it kinda made me think of Glen More (another game I like) - perhaps how the land tiles have to connect in a certain way - I dunno.  Either way, it was fun and I also like the random way the disasters come into play as I am a big fan of games that throw things at you that force you to adapt on the fly.

Very nice Civ Lite Game. There are 5 catastrophes in this game witch gives it a heavy negative reinforcement mechanic.

Runnaway leader is a real problem if the disasters hit you wrong or an auction doesn't go your way.

Nice clean little engine game.  Cute bidding mechanism.  This game forces you to push your luck in different ways, if things pay off, more's the better, if not it is usually disastrous and chances are you are out of the game.  That said, you don't have to take big risks, often you can mitigate your luck, and even if your game implodes from bad draws, it plays in 1/2 an hour so who cares.  It's dramatic fun when it all crumbles. Then you play it again.

It does everything right that I thought was dry and tedious with In the Year of the Dragon.

Absolutely terrible, and a new overrated shiny game.  If you want something new with an auction twist, get Homesteaders.  There are very limited choices on limited auctions and the auction mechanic is pretty brutal.  I'm guessing that the civ element and art is raising the rating of this game, but it's not worth your time.

RATING: 7
This is a cool civ-themed economic auction game. Players start with a single tile representing their civ. Each round, there's a clever auction for several new tiles -- buildings and lands. Each has a minimum bid. Players bid on any tile; if overbid, they cannot change their bid, but must simply move it to another legal tile (one with a minimum bid cost not higher than the bid)! Or, they pass and earn extra coins. Tiles each have certain building requirements, and provide income in one or more currencies (population or goods), and/or some game bonuses (e.g., protection from a disaster). The disasters (5? types) occur when the 3rd tile of that type is drawn -- so you have _some_ warning that a disaster of a specific type may be about to hit. The game is only 8 turns; at the end, each player's score is the lower of their population or prestige points. 

Fun game, although it seems almost too quick! For a real civ theme, it seems to me that a game should last at least 90 minutes or so. May have to try to get this one!

Played with six and had a great time, then played with two and it's different but just as fun.  I'm still not sure what number I like better, but it scales awfully well.  I also like the fact that you can play solitaire, which sounds quite challenging.  The decisions here are intense, such as which tile to bid on, how much to bid, and the victory conditions just add to the tension.  I love it!

RATING: N/A
Very interesting civ game. It's very fun to play and also very tough to manage. I've played 2 solo games before getting the picture but when I got into the core game with more players I had lots of trouble managing my money and especially getting food enough for my people.
Liked it a lot and really think that this could be one of my favourites for the year. 
I have some doubts on its replayability because there are only a few tiles although I have the 6 player sea expansion. 
I predict that in the near future new tiles are needed or even a solid new expansion.

Update:
As I predicted it really needs expansions. It became old in the same year as in not interesting anymore because it doesn't allow deep strategy. It's almost like Peloponnes is a learning game for something better that doesn't exist. It's not bad but it's not good enough to survive over time.

A civilization-building game in which players are bidding for tiles to add, building up resources and population, and preparing for disasters.  It always felt like income was so tight in this game, and the auction phase was nerve-wracking in a good way.  I would play this again, but my son didn't enjoy it as much as I did.

RATING: 5
Light and fairly quick, it is hampered in the early plays by an excess amount of luck.  But once you're familiar with the cards and what will be coming up, you can better gauge the odds of cards showing which you might want to hold you bid for.  

Therein lies the problem though--since the game will be decided by probably just a couple points or less, the inability to know what is coming up prevents your ability to enact and follow a strategy.  Which means matching moderately closely skilled players will result in a winner decided solely by luck.

In order to make the game more a contest of skill, you'd need to see, at least, the next turn's cards--but that messes with the effects of the disasters.  

What is a shame about games like this, is that, even when familiar with the cards, the game is progressively less luck-based--as the game continues your ability to make bids based on odds of particular cards coming up increases, but so much of the game has already transpired by that point.  So even though you gain slightly in your ability to control your own destiny, sometimes it is too little, too late.

Now all that said, the auction mechanic is quite nice--the inability to increase a bid after you've been bumped is quite cool.  The pay 3 extra for the conquest tiles and there non-outbiddable nature...very cool.  I also found the limiting nature of the land tiles--that you can't add another land type unless the previous one shares a resource--to be very nice as well.  Rather than feeling that it limited anything, instead it felt like it added another dimension you needed to consider in your bidding.  

But again, early in the game, you're hampered with an inability to know what's coming up, plus you have no luxury items so your ability to generate "emergency" funds to grab that needed tile when you just spent 1 coin too many on the last auction...all based solely on luck of the timing, well that just sucks.

Interesting game, though it's not much to look at.   I'm a little worried you can get really, really hosed by the tiles and be unable to feed your civ, but otherwise I think this is a good, straightforward 45 minute Civ game.  There are a few neat twists, like the Knizia-esque scoring mechanism and the building loans, though I'm not sure I'm completely happy with the way bidding works.  We played with 3, and it seemed like it worked out fine, but I'd have to play more to know whether it can be unreasonable.

Good theme play.  Easy to learn and play, takes a game or two to figure out strategies.  Not much new as far as mechanics, but interesting scoring mechanism.  Fun game.

RATING: 8
Wow... this is quite a little game.  The auction system is quite unique (at least for me).  I haven't seen one like it in any other game.  Once you have made a bid and are overbid you can shift that bid to another tile but the amount of the bid can not be changed.  When you combine that with the option to just straight up conquest it makes for a very interesting auction.  I like it!

We just finished a 3-player game in under an hour (and that was with the expansion).  It goes by so quick yet you have built an entire civilization.

Also interesting is the scoring (an end game event).  It is scored a la "Tigris & Euphrates" in that the lower of your two scores (prestige & population) is your final score.  I would have won the last game if the final score was based on the combination of the two.  Another player would have scored if it had been the highest of the two scores but the real winner was the other player who ended up with the best balanced (population & prestige) civilization.  So its not so much of a power game as it is one of finesse.

To me this is an under-rated game.

RATING: 6
First play: I had horrible luck; anyone could have. Not sure if I played a different city state next time it would be better. Disasters seem too strong. Having to match your land resource tile can lock you out of food which leads to more bad luck. It was actually enjoyable to play, but discouraging that one player (OK, me) could get so locked out early on and have to basically watch others truly be in competition for an hour.

Second play: Moved rating up from a 5 to 6 after a second play. Still not a very fun game, but there are things to do to avoid bad luck.

RATING: 7
[Irongames 2011 edition] {Civilisation; bidding; optimal 4-5p} Peloponnes is a nice bidding game.  Bidding is the core mechanic, with very limited resources and gold.

The disaster is a nice element in this game to prevent player hoarding too much resources and allow more randomness to the game.

I don't think luck is too important in this game, even though tile draws and chits draws are present.  I do believe players can manage their development and score fairly easily in this game.

The game component is effective.  The illustration is ok.  The tokens are very mundane.  I wish the box would be much smaller to make it more portable.

Két és fél év alatt 14 parti után azt kell, hogy mondjam ennek a játéknak a TOP50-ben lenne a helye. Remekül összerakott játék, kiváló hangulattal és eredeti játékmechanizmusokkal. Kevés olyan játék van a 6fős baráti körben, ami mindenkinek tetszik. Talán a Peloponnes az egyetlen. Ez sem véletlen: gémereknek és kevésbé gémereknek egyaránt tetszik.
Újrajátszhatósága kiváló.
Az induló városok adottságainak érdekes módon nagy a szórása, de ettől talán csak izgalmasabb a kihívás. A sikeres játékhoz nagyon oda kell figyelni a stratégiára, milyen nyersanyagokat szerez a lapunk, ezáltal milyen lapokkal tudunk bővülni? Lesz elég gabonánk? Lesz elég erőforrásunk elkerülni a katasztrófákat? Egyensúlyozás, jó ritmusérzék, mások játékára való odafigyelés, némi szerencse persze, stratégiai tervezés (és ez most nem csak lózung, hanem érzi az ember, hogy stratégiai döntéseket kell hoznia). Minden tekintetben kifogástalan a játék.

RATING: N/A
When I saw the player boards I was like: oh no, spreadsheets.
When I saw the action tiles I was like: ok, standard euro gather resources, spending it on more stuff, getting more resources, repeat until score.

But then the game got explained, and I discovered the bidding mechanism. GOOD. Some interaction. Then I discovered the loan mechanism. GOOD. No more frustrating grinding towards the right resources, but a 'push your luck' element allowing more strategy as well. Then I discovered the disaster mechanism. GOOD. 
Even more strategic planning besides the tactical bidding.

All in all, more than enough to really get me interested. The theme is great as well (civilization building) and is supported well by the mechanics. Finally, playtime is short so that is a great plus as well as it will hit the table more often.

Will be looking for this game.

Peloponnes "felt" a whole lot like In the Year of the Dragon to me, not in the mechanics so much as in the common ground of planning for and muddling through a series of looming disasters. The game has a simple, if uninspired, bid mechanic and a pretty satisfying "build your production engine" element. I think this is going to end up ranking as a solid game that I will gladly play now and again, but not a title I need to own.

Very solid mini-auction light civilization game. Just a few decisions, but they are very critical. There is significant luck in the order the disasters appear, but perhaps there are ways to mitigate. The expansion is a very nice addition to the game as playing with six is definitely a good option and the sea tiles add another strategic option. Great components from a new publisher. Rules have some significant errors in them, but the FAQ certainly helps.

RATING: 5
Player interaction is minimal in Peloponnes, and that magnifies the remaining issues:  the disasters are too strong and they are not varied enough.  They roll out like clockwork and empty out nearly every player but one or two--and not necessarily those who planned best. You've got to have luck in a civ-lite game, but Peloponnes is a lonely beat-down.

After 2 plays, I am curious to know if the winner is determined by anything besides the timing and order of how the disasters come out.

2/22/13 - The distasters definitely make up the biggest chunk of the game in terms of scoring. He who best prepares and dodges the nasty affects of the disasters, stands a chance at winning in this one.

This is not a "civ lite" game and anyone who goes in expecting a "civ lite" game is likely to be disappointed (which could lead to a reenactment of the Great Tempus Debacle of 2006). This is an auction game with a civilization-theme. I'm told it uses "Evo-style bidding," but having only played Evo once a million years ago (with actual dinosaurs), I don't know how accurate that is. I do know that it uses bidding, and a lot of it, and it focuses all of your important decision-making on the bidding, on using your money wisely, on evaluating what you need most, and what your opponents might need, so you can figure out what to bid on and just as crucial, how much to bid. The trick in this game is that the amount you bid is locked in, so if you get outbid, all you can do is change your bid to another tile up for auction, not change your bid to raise the amount for that tile or any other tile. It's a somewhat interesting auction game with a Tigris-style scoring system of only counting the lower of points on buildings or population, but the civilization theme seems more likely to hurt this game's reception than to help it, as is so often the case.

RATING: 7

Peloponnes is a very quick tile-laying civilization building auction game.  Five tiles come out and there's an auction.  You bid once. And if you're outbid you can move, but not increase, your bid to another item provided you can afford it/outbid whoever is already there.  If you pass you get your money back and a bonus coin.  Turn order is reset by how much you spent.  Tiles give you increases in population (which trickles down to income) and resource production, which is mostly used for feeding and paying the cost to build other tiles.

It's got a Knizian scoring system where you get the lower of 3 times your population or the sum of the VP values of your tiles and 1/3 your money.

Oh, and there are disasters that mess with things and they're semi-random... you can see when you're at risk but you never know when something will happen.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
A light civ-building or tableau-building game. Auctions govern who gets what, but there are a couple of constraints (which I tend to appreciate): Some tiles can be outright purchased for a relatively high price; and if you are outbid on something you must move to another item (or withdraw), but cannot alter your bid amount.

You are bidding on land and building tiles. Land tiles have placement restrictions relative to the last land tile you placed (which somewhat reduces competition for them as others may not even be able to place the same tiles you want in the auction). Buildings cost resources to build. Both types give you resources. Some tiles grant special perks, notably immunity to one type of disasters (of which there are five types).

The various resources are: your population (who produce money), money (which is mainly used for bidding, and not convertible into anything else, which is interesting), wood, stone, food, and luxuries (which do act wild as resources, but are produced by hitting the top end of the tracks for wood/stone/food).

Every turn disaster tokens are drawn; when a third token of the same disaster is drawn, it takes effect. Each type of disaster either destroys a chunk of your resources (people, food, or luxuries) or else requires you to spend resources in order to keep each one of your building or land tiles (depending on which disaster it is). To some extent you can try to prepare for these. By game end all five disasters occur.

Your score is equal to the lower of: triple your population, or the point value of all your tiles (to which you also add a point for each set of three coins you have). But this brings up something I didn't really like about the game: Especially towards the end, I feel I should grab a calculator and even paper and calculate the outcomes of each option I have. In the last auction I might also want to calculate where everyone else is as well. The math isn't hard but there are enough numbers that it's hard to simply do it in my head. This prevents the game from having the same light and friendly feel as 7 Wonders.

A second blow to my enthusiasm was that my first game (a 3p) ended in a three-way tie. And for all three the score came from population: If one's final score [i]generally[/i] is based on population then I will have to remember that the claimed point values on the tiles are misleading.

...After a couple more games (and incidentally bringing in expansions, though those are just OK), I'm upping it .5 to match 7 Wonders.

I didn't encounter, and didn't even really remember, my two gripes about the game. I didn't get the "mathy" feel anymore, although I should say part of it is that I was assuming (incorrectly as it turns out!) that everyone's scores would end up being determined by population. So, I guess I'm still undecided on the mathiness.

The disasters are reminiscent of In the Year of the Dragon but are definitely of less interest: most of them are not devastating; there's not that much you can do to prepare (you can buy specific tiles, but it may not even be worth it); and even if you could prepare, it's too unpredictable when a given disaster will hit.

I played this six or seven times.  I really wanted to love this game.  I love tile games, I like this theme.  I'm always open to being proven wrong, but I believe this game is overrated.  Or, at the very least, the decisions required to win are so specific that I simply don't find playing it fun.  

I've rewound games in my head trying to figure out how I'm losing or winning.  The choices I made were not calculated, they were just dumb luck.  Now, I'm not saying winning or losing is based purely on luck.  What I mean is, in order for my decisions to be calculated I would need to know the tiles inside and out - what's been offered and what's yet to appear.  Combine that with watching the disaster tiles.  It ultimately ends up as a game requiring super concentration and knowledge to win a game that you strategized from move one.  Instead, when I win I feel like I just fell into it.  And when I lose it feels like it was because I accidentally paid too much for a tile on the previous turn and now I'm screwed because this NEXT tile is the one I truly need. Bah, I have better games to play!

RATING: 8
This is a good gateway auction game. Players don't have to work out the monetary value of tiles, since each one tells you what the minimum bid has to be. I find this makes it kinder to new players, and prevents someone with experience from making off with a tile that the others don't realise the importance of. The game evokes the feeling of micro-managing a civilisation, without any  overburdening complexity.

Fast and fun light Civ game. Each player gets a different starting Civ, and from there bids and buys tiles to expand. Tiles give you money, people, wood, stone, food etc, which you use to build new tiles, feed your people etc. Neat bidding mechanic where if you're outbid, you have to move your bid to a new spot, but don't get to increase how much you bid. This means that you often have to make your initial bid higher than you may want, so that you have an exit strategy of choosing another. This is because different tiles have different minimum bids. 

During this growth, there are five disasters that always occur, but the order varies. Some of the tiles protect from these disasters, so it's very much a game of timing in order to get through them. Final scoring is based on the lowest of two items, so you have to balance everything.

A lighter civilization building type game.  The mechanisms all worked just fine but none of them were new or innovative for me.  It is a good little game but just didn't offer me anything new, still it is put together nicely, played fairly quickly and was easy enough to understand after a quick explanation.

Very good, quick, civilization game. Surprisingly nasty with the game constantly trying to destroy your land and buildings and to starve and kill your population.

Well, well, look what we have here: An hour-long civ-building game with resource management and bidding mechanisms!  And it's designed by the same guy who designed St. Petersburg and Stone Age, two games I dig, so it has a familiar flavor with some interesting things happening over the course of the game.  To be honest, I can't really judge it on its multiplayer aspects, since I've only played one solitaire game where the bidding didn't even come into play, but that solitaire game was pretty impressive.  Money seems incredibly tight as it is, and I wonder if it would get worse in multiplayer games, where you're likely to be paying more than just what's listed on the tile up for bid.  It's cool, though, and has been bumped on my list of games to play with more folks.

Great middle-weight game. My wife's favourite. It scales well, it goes smoothly with 6 players (or even 7), it's fast (1h). You build, you bid, you fight calamities - it's a struggle from the first turn till the very end.

Expansions make it even better. D-round gives you space for long term stategies. Seas let you balance your  efforts. Goats give flexibililty. Trade option makes  players fight for the last place - that's new.

I guess this game will never leave my collection. Great underrated gem. If you have a spouse and wanna play civ game - this is it. Find it, buy it and spread the word.

el modo solitario depende en exceso del orden de las losetas, al existir pocas opciones a elegir esta muy condicionado. Por ello no deja de ser un simpatico pasatiempos.

Light and fast civilization-themed semi-filler stays surprisingly light and fast even when playing with all the expansions at the same time. 7/10 for the base game, 9/10 with the expansions.

Feels like a whole lot of game for a short, streamlined game with only a few (crucial) decisions.  I won't know for a while if there is any particular strategy, but I know I will definitely be playing this one again.

it works, it's not complicated, there's no interaction, there isnt a great strategic aspect to the game, but most of all it is completely unoriginal and uninteresting, scarcely funny.  i dont regret playing it but there won't be a second time, i suppose

Bland, familiar, and not particularly deep. Still, its brevity elicits a higher-than-deserved rating - assuming that the game is not taken too seriously and played at the speed that it deserves.

Civ building in less than an hour. This uses a guick bidding system. Several items, buildings or terrain, are up for bid each turn. Each has a minimum bid. You bid the max that you wish for that turn on one of the items. If you are outbid you must move your bid to another item, that you can still afford. So often even the cheapest items go for higher prices to protect the item. It works really well. There are 2 types of victory points. People and money/tiles. Whichever catagory you score the least in is your final score so you want to increase both during the game.

Auction game without actual bidding. When outbid, a player can't increase his bid and must relocate to a different tile. No big deal with four tiles worth buying; otherwise going last is king, and there's no telling when one of these rounds will show up. Supply phases and disasters can brutalize players who are more susceptible than others but the timing is largely random. As players win bids and spend wood, stone, and luxury goods their vulnerabilities fluctuate, so come second-to-last turn when you have equal odds to pull X, Y, or Z disaster some players are going to suffer immensely while others benefit comparatively. Even in a turn where say Decline and Earthquake are guaranteed, if Decline occurs first it hoses people reliant on luxury goods to save their buildings during Earthquake. (Naturally, bad luck in one of these areas reduces your final score anywhere from 10-30% in one blow.) Buildings that grant protection from Drought and Plague are usually subpar, but can suddenly skyrocket in value if those disasters persist until the last turn. Not enough player interaction. If two players desire the same building, the person latest in turn order wins, unless the first player has more money and is willing to over-pay. The game runs eight rounds, and you make one decision per round. It's not enough.

A very stripped down and straight forward city building game.  I don't really consider it a civilization game because it lacks many elements of that genre.  There is no technology tree, no trading, no conflict and no player interaction.  It is simply rounds after rounds of resource gathering and ultimately victory points accumulation.  There is very little decision and long term planning you have to do, and most of what you should bid on is largely determined by the tiles that are flipped up combined with what you already have and whether there are any possible disaster coming up.

Gameplay is bland and dry.  The only thing different about Peloponnes is the bidding mechanic, once you made a bid, you cannot increase it when you're outbid and you cannot retract it as long as there is something else that you can afford with your original bid (so essentially it means you have only one chance at a tile).  Otherwise, there is nothing really new here.  I'd rather be playing Roll Through the Ages if I want something short with a similar theme.  Peloponnes just felt very unsatisfying and repetitive.

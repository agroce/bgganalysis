Innovative take on word games...but still a [b]Scattergories[/b] variant.  Love the style and awesome chunky bits.  Strange that the spools have numbers on both sides...makes start player selection awkward. And the game is oddly short.  Can't believe there's no "play to 30" rule or similar in initial run.

Got to play an advance copy of this at GAMA. The production as a whole is FANTASTIC. Kudos to Zman here, the game looks incredible. The box is glossy, the player sheets and the spools and the clues...literally everything is top notch and I have to imagine this thing is going to sell like gangbusters. In terms of game play, it is a good, light, social word game. It plays very much like scattegories with a slight twist, in that you get to help craft the set of cues that are going to apply to a given word. 

It has the same inherent problems that are common to a competitive game of scattegories, namely that when played with certain people, arguments are going to break out about borderline or creative clues (even though they are strictly encouraged in the rules) and the game kind of breaks and becomes unfun with everything is getting challenged and people become sore about it. The solution is to play this with the right people, or just throw out the scoring overall and have fun being creative and coming up with fun answers. A great family game, and one to draw non-gamers in as it looks awesome on the table and is very easy to learn.

Good looking game. It's like Scattergories, except you all collectively create the prompts. This is its strength and weakness, as this preliminary to the quick brainstorm afterwards feels almost like two games, and that's a bit hard to place with a group.

Another game that I jump the gun because of its components. Word party game, that's one of my weaknesses. Gameplay was fun and quite hilarious but people that are not that good with words might struggle to come out with ideas and will not be having much fun. Gathering dust in the shelf as well cause nothing beats Codenames when it comes to word party games.

I decided to disband my bootleg copy of Knit Wit. It's interesting for a few plays only, then falls flat. The spools and buttons have returned to the sewing kit. As for the loops and word cards, I'll hang on to them for now to do some creative writing exercises with in my journal. The word association mechanic still appeals to the writer in me, just not to my gamer side.

Very similar to Codenames in core concept, but inexplicably weak in the 'game' aspect of execution.  The components are neat (if under-utilized in implementation for how original they are), and the concept of coming up with one word to link random given words is fun although identical to Codenames.  The complete subjectivity of scoring though is brutal; it's like the designer thought "let's take the teamwork and deduction of Codenames and replace it with.... yarn."

It seems like I've been playing a lot of word games lately... Normally I hate word games, I'm a bad speller and my vocabulary sucks (I know its pretty surprising, its my only flaw). Knit Wit is a word game that I don't hate. While it helps that this game has some unique components and mechanics, I actually find it amusing and frustrating trying to think up answers. For example we had 'Sharp' and 'Dull'... After much though my answer was knife. 

I'm actually looking forward to playing this one again. From me that's pretty high praise for a word game.

RATING: 7
An interesting word game and while maybe not the best with two I still enjoyed giving this a quick play. The components are amazing and it looks great all laid out on the table. We had some interesting word combinations and for the next play I probably should have taken some time with my spool/loop placements to make sure I had decent words in mind because I honestly felt lost when it was time to start writing words for some of the spools. I don't think it will be as big of a hit as Codenames but it is still fun and I can't wait to find more word combinations in my next play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
A fun game of thinking up words/phrases/things/people that fit several categories (e.g. historical, bright, hard). The group decisions on whether answers are correct or not feels like it could be better. 6 or 7?

Despite the components being cute, the theme feels too pasted on. The underlying game is okay but could be played much quicker without messing around with the string and spools. The white pencils and black paper sacrifices too much function for the sake of form.

I suspect the price has kept the rating down. I thought this was brilliant fun, but wouldn't want to pay more than £15-20 for a copy. It's much like Cards Against Humanity in that it's more fun if you embrace humour and play with the right people, although it's nowhere near as great at core as CAH. On further thought, maybe it’s a bit unbalanced - dropped to a 7.

Original & good-looking word game. Spools and yarn are used to make interesting categories that the players must try to provide creative answers for. This succeeds as a light but challenging game where creativity is the key. Disclaimer: if you are aggressively "play-to-win", it is likely everyone at the table will have a bad time. I enjoyed this most treating it as a relaxed, creative group activity. The only noticeable con for me was that although I had no trouble myself, there were several players who had significant issues trying to visually ascertain what words (colored strings) the spools were located inside.

There seems to be a trend of taking two proven entities and combining them into something new.  That's not necessarily a bad thing.  Codenames = Battleship + Password.   In this case, Knit Wit = Venn Diagrams + Scattergories.   It's clever and it works.   I don't like Scattegories very much, but would play this party game if enough other fun people are playing.   The over-production is an asset, not a detriment.  (Exception:  the tickets and ticket holder - yuck).

I've never played Scattergories, but this seems like it's probably a better version. The spools/threads can be confusing, but the variety that they create is worth it.

This is one of those games where it's fun to hear what everyone's answers are, then passionately call bullshit on them and force them to justify what they wrote.

Damn. Was really looking forward to this but it's far too fiddly for us, and for some reason making a call to vote someone's word out (and basically force them to defend their logic which you then take or leave as a group) feels nastier than it should. I think it's because there's actually a load of effort first making the darned loops and so on and then figuring out the categories to hit per word and then racing to find an answer... Too much effort, too fiddly, small payoff, surprisingly adversarial and with real potential to cause arguments. Again - damn. Because it looked SO GOOD.

Based on one evening with Knit Wit (2 rounds) I would suggest it at others' parties if they had it on the shelf. The pieces are nice, even though the yarn-made Venn diagrams turn out to be harder to read than anticipated. We weren't as cutthroat in our group with the rules. We quickly summarized the categories in each spool before writing. We also had generic terms match specifics, so nobody could take advantage of the looseness of it (i.e. if somebody went for "cartoon character" as opposed to Daffy Duck, it would cancel out all the cartoon characters). Besides, without the letter restriction of Scattergories, you're allowed to run wild! The freedom provided by Knit Wit alone is enough to distinguish it from other games like it. It's the speed mechanic that will keep it from playing well at my family gatherings.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (April 2016)

My desire to play Knit Wit was VERY low. I have hated every Matt Leacock game I have played so I had no reason to expect different form Knit Wit. I didn’t want to play it, but I was outvoted by my game group, so we played it and I’m happy to report that I REALLY enjoyed it.

The rules are uber-easy, you can explain them under 3 minutes, but the gameplay is around the 25 minute mark (I guess it could go a lot faster if players decided to end the game quicker taking the buttons).

The game´s components are amazing for such a simple game. Z-Man Games really did a great job with the production values, perhaps they are overproduced.

Knit Wit is a word game in which you have to search for things the grouped words have in common (reminiscent of Codenames, which is still the better game) and you have to do it fast or else you will surely lose (there is a time limit a la Pictomania). It is a lot harder than it appears. I enjoyed it a lot.

On the bad side, I (heavily) dislike the voting/judging aspect. Some players can vote “No” just because you are winning and that’s the Achilles´ heel the game has. I hate subjective scoring in any game, so perhaps this can make me downgrade the rating of the game with more plays. Time will tell.

Best with 6 players.

Bottom line, a good and novel party game. I will definitively buy it in the near future. As most party games, it depends a lot on the game group, with the correct one, it is a blast to play.

After a couple of plays, I can say I still enjoy the game and the idea behind it, but the scoring system bothers me a lot, due to this I’m downgrading its rating. I will keep the game in my game collection for now.

I finally decide to sell the game. It pains me a bit, but my desire to play the game again is low due to its scoring system. A spiteful/vengeful player can wreck it just because and that´s very unfair.

Knit Wit is the best Matt Leacock I have ever played.

A party game in the tradition of Scattergories with a knitting theme around it.  This is going to generate laughs and the struggle to come up with words or phrases is maybe more than you would think.  Someone needs to closely referee the "knit wit" rule to make sure the justification stays to 10 seconds and the voting is swift, otherwise this game can get way out of hand.  Scoring is highly subjective based on who you play with and what answers the majority accepts.  Top notch production of components and the game plays very fast.  A good warm up to perhaps loosen people up.  Score sheet pad will run out and then i'll miss the charming "chalkboard" look it brings to the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Got the game for $20.  I don't think it is even worth that much.  The game is a lot like Scattergories.  Having all the loops intersecting each other makes the game hard to determine which words goes with which spool.  Overall, this game is somewhat disappointing.

This is Scategories but wayyy better. I absolutely love the components and really the entire concept. My biggest complaint is that there's always "that guy" that wants to have a 5 or 6 word clue and constantly overburdens some of the spools. But all in all, this pretty much kills Scategories for me.

UPDATE: No longer better than Scattergories. Every play just feels the same.

Very clever. I'm almost ready to throw away Scattergories now. Beautiful production and interesting gameplay make this a hit. Played 3 rounds of it as soon as we got home.  It's thinky and combines slow and fast pace elements in an interesting way. That said, it is definitely a "with the right group" type of game as it will not have mass appeal the way other games would. My family liked it; my students called it "the Venn diagram game" so consider that.

It is of my personal belief that this game originated from some genius's subconscious dreams, or perhaps their drug-induced hallucintations. "Okay: lets make a game about Venn Diagrams, and we'll have players use thread, spools, clothespins, black paper, and wild imaginations."

It works. It is creative, and can be very very funny. As in Telestrations, I believe that this game is more about memorable laughs and ideas than about winning.

Good and unique production.

Wow. Knit Wit is a fun, fast party game, so I'm surprised by how pleasant and engaging it is when playing with just my husband.

This word game can be quite fun, provided no "serious" players participate.

As someone who loves math, a game based on Venn diagrams is just, well, cool. Connecting all those bits of information into something believable is tricky though. And then we have that one player who is always trying to get "half" points for getting half of the qualities right. This isn't graded on a curve!

Played it with my kids, its a good fun game to play with both family and friends, but be prepared for discussions on what constitutes as a correct answer!!

This was a strange little [thing=2381][/thing]-like boardgame.  There are several adjectives placed on the table with loops attached to each.  There are also several numbers that get placed on the table, surrounded by any number of the loops.  Then you play Scattegories where you answer for each number has to match each of the adjectives that surround the number.  The numbers with more adjectives are worth more points.

It was pretty fun.  Definitely an improvement over Scattegories.  We had 6 people and it felt pretty good.  I wouldn't want to play with 4 or fewer.

I like it. Gorgeous production. Need a few plays to see how it works with the 
"non-gamers". Could end up actually being a huge hit with the parents.

It looks pleasant enough, but Knit Wit is secretly WORD HELL.

This is an enjoyable party game [b]but[/b] it's important to do the following:

-Explain to players that they should try to be creative with their answers. If "Purple" and "sad" are together, they could say "Barney at a funeral."
-Explain that you only cancel out an answer if it is the exact same answer that somebody else wrote down. The designer has said that this is to prevent too much arguing about the meanings of different phrases and this rule keeps the game moving along.

In my first games there was a ton of discussion about similar answers and a lot of people calling "knit wit," which is the game's term for challenging an answer. People had different expectations about how strict the rules are and what type of answers should be given. But after explaining the above, the game flows a lot more smoothly and there are far fewer challenges.

If everybody is on board, this is a fun party game. It plays fast and you'll want to play a few times in a row. I don't think it's quite as good as my top-tier party games, Codenames and Taboo, but those games really need even-numbered teams and Knit Wit can easily handle odd numbers so it should see some play when we have odd numbers.

[b]Player Count Verdict: 5+[/b]
It's a party game, so you really need more players for more interaction and more varied answers. I would possibly play with four to introduce the game to people, but you want at least five for a good time.

Word games are generally not my favorite as I am not super creative; this one is pretty good as you have some guidelines to help you though it. I would prefer a "timer" to write answers down rather than "once the majority is done" but otherwise its good.

1 playthrough, 2 player. Good game but looking forward to trying with more people. Looks to be a solid party game. Very pretty. 
*edit* played a few games with four players and I'm really enjoying it. I like the chances to be really creative with your answers. The voting mechanic helps reduce the long debates that happen with other  word games like Scattergories.

I dislike games in which players vote and make subjective judgements about answers. (In contrast, the Dixit mechanism of guessing a choice is okay.)

Such high hopes for this one...problems start with the difficulty of being able to see which words are connected to which loops.  Nice components though.  This one just did not come together well.

I love word games, and this one is really beautifully presented.  It was a bit of a marmite game in my gaming group - I think whether you enjoy it depends on how your mind works. Could be quite group dependent, with potential for arguing if taken too seriously.

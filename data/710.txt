Unfortunately, for me, nostalgia about this game is more important than the game itself.  I grew up playing (and loving) this one, then recently played the Steve Jackson reprint -- and wasn't too impressed.  I'm not that good at strategy wargames anyway but when you factor in my consistently appalling die rolls, this game just isn't that much fun for me...

A game about an organism's antibodies doing battle with an infestation, has got to be one of the most original ever. Another great Tom Wham game, with his inimitable art style..

This entry is for "Snit's Revenge"; another copy of this game appears for "Snit Smashing," although I have only the one box which includes both. Snit's Revenge is easily the better of the two games.

Finally I bought an ebay copy that included Snit Bashing as well! Now all I need is a willing opponent...

Then it went out of print again :(

I heard a very enrolling description of this at the original Games Workshop near Stamford Brook around 1980 (they used to sell other publishers' games) but was far too poor at the age of 12 to get it. I really ought to get a copy as it's still in print.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Another good Tom Wham game, but not as good as the Awful Green Things from Outer Space.  The 'spark' only has so many places to hide, so the Snits have a pretty good advantage if I remember right.  Great art, and more games should take place inside of living things.

Memorable for the goofy art by old Dungeons and Dragons artist Tom Wham.  Bizarro anatomy game, with art, that in retrospect is rather suggestive.  Simple, simple game, but it was fun to play.

Of all the Tom Wham games, this may be the Whammiest.  Willfully silly and deliciously inventive.  Something in me thinks that this game could be... not re-themed, but re-mechaniced, incorporating euro kinds of strategies and systems.  I don't know why I think it would work, but I do.  And the result would be the least euro-y euro in history.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.75
More fun back in the day, but still an entertaining play.  Can be over a little tooo fast.

I love Tom Wham's games even when they are far from perfect... the cartoon artwork and the dynamic game play make titles like Awful Green Things from Outer Space and Dragon Lairds a lot of fun.

UPDATE: I discovered only when checking the game for completeness after having offered it up for sale, that there were multi-player rules!!!  So I scanned a copy of the board and some chits to make a home-made copy later.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Very funny theme and artwork combined with good, simple mechanics.  Playable with some kids.

I regret getting rid of this game. I had the big box with the mounted board. I fondly remember the quirky artwork, so I am not sure why I got rid of this one. Maybe because I wasn't such a fan of 2-player games, or I found it too confrontational. I wish I still had my 1980 version now.

Stupid concept, wonderfully executed.  This is a great game for what it is.  When I learned the object of the game (snits invading the body of a bolotomus, in order to kill it), I was a little put off by it.  However, once I got past that, I fell in love with the game, and love to bring it out on rare occasions.  :)

Along with Awful Green Things we played this alot in 83.  Now, my daughter likes this game.  It's a total dice fest but Wham's graphics, names, story, etc... add an incredible humor element.

Really strange game. It gets credit for being unique, but loses it with all of the strange pseudo-biology you're expected to deal with. I played once as the Bolotomus and lost quickly with no real chance to defend myself. Maybe bad luck?

This probably has the weirdest theme of any game I have played. The game feels like it was created by a salty Dr. Seuss who is out of cares to give. This bizarre theme does make the first play a decent enough experience. Unfortunately, this just does not have much game play behind it. The game is a very luck dependent dice fest. For instance the number of snits the player gets is determined by a random dice roll, and that number has a big impact on the game.

Snits Revenge:  I really love this little war game.  Nice asymetrical game that creates a race against time for the snits as their little men start dwindling.  The Bolotomus is always backed against the wall.  Really wonderful balance, great maneuvering, fun objectives.  Highly recommended.  Too bad Steve Jackson spent the money on his retarded catalog rather than on the game.  Flimsy pieces, folded and then bent paper board.  Overall total crap quality that you come to expect from Steve Jackson.  That said who else is going to put out a Tom Wham game.  One of the best magazine games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
So much nostalgia, so much time spent playing. Do you have one of those games that you feel like, for whatever reason, that it's part of your family?

This is mine. 

I now have fun playing it with my kids. The Snits and Runnungitums take on a personality all their own.

RATING: 3
This is a guessing dicefest that offers only the tiniest bit of strategy in where the spark is kept and where the snits decide to go after all or be selective in which ones they go after. Not really a game for me, although certainly not bad for being 35 years old.

Snit's Revenge is a much more robust and exciting game than its predecessor, Snit Smashing. One can see the roots of Tom Wham's later (and better) game, Awful Green Things. Indeed, there is some decent strategy and plenty of Tom's trademark goofy humor. It is held back somewhat by being a strictly 2-player game and the end game does seem to drag on just a little longer than it should.

RATING: 6
[i]Pros:[/i]

Snit's Revenge has two things going for it: extreme whimsy, and a short playing time. With no shame whatsoever, I'll always pick Revenge over Battle Cry, Memoir '44, and Hold the Line.  Those games do nothing for me at all.

You could also do a lot worse than Snit's Revenge in terms of Wham designs, as Revenge is far, far better than Feudality, Kings & Things, Snit Smashing, and many others.

[i]The flipside[/i]:

If you're in a "real" wargaming mood and have a bit more time, there's no reason not to play a dozen other games instead of Snit's Revenge, all of which have minimal rules overhead: Test of Fire, Sekigahara, Victoria Cross, Quebec 1759, and Manoeuvre, for starters.  Even Awful Green Things is the better choice if you have an extra 30 minutes.

But it is what it is, which is short, silly, and sweet.  Snit's Revenge would have been better had I first played it 35 years ago - like I wanted - but it still gets the job done.

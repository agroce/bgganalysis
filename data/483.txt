Maybe I'm just too much of a schemer.  Or maybe I hold grudges too much.
Or maybe its the maximising.
But I just can't get along in this game.  People don't trust me.  I love the Middle Earth variant though:  Downfall.

First played at school when we used to have two sets of orders a week. I think I may have only played this ftf once or twice but I probably had several games on the go at one when I was very active in the postal hobby. I love the idea and the mechanics are great but I really suck at negotiation and don't enjoy that aspect at all - and if you take away the negotiation in Diplomacy there really isn't a game. I don't mind adjudicating though.

RATING: 10
In my opinion Diplomacy is by far the best strategy boardgame ever created, purely for the fact that it doesn't have any dice (or cards for that matter) and subsequently relies entirely on pure skill and is also very simple to pick up and play.

RATING: 10
An amazing game for the right situation. You need a group of friends who are willing to stab and be stabbed with no hard feelings. Also a serious time commitment in a single sitting.

My Dip group got around this by migrating most of our games to online. Mitigates some of the anger surrounding a well timed stab, adjudicates the rules, and keeps track of the board if you leave it for a while.

RATING: 8
A game that is so good it's almost dangerous because it gets in your head and stays there plaguing you with doubts and fears. Very simple but almost endlessly replayable because the game depends on the players not the other way round. And the only boardgame that is improved by being played online. If only it wasn't unbalanced it might be perfect.

This game is so great, but getting 7 players in a room to complete a game is the almost impossible part.  Luckly you can play by Email and have almost the same experience.

Only played online. It's very tense, and even emotionally taxing sometimes, as you really have to trust people you suspect aren't being trustworthy. It's intense. There comes a point though (later in the game), where the game starts to just get played out, the writing is on the wall, and I was just going through the motions, hoping it would end soon.

RATING: 7
A classic wargame, where the main focus is on diplomacy, scheming, alliances and backstabbing. It's certainly interesting but probably not for everyone. 

Before playing Diplomacy, everyone should be aware that it can easily take an entire day to play and might cause some friends to be pissed off at you in real life as well..

RATING: 6
Critical to the game is the process of talking to enemies and allies. Secondary are the actual mechanics of moving armies and fleets (mastered quickly). Those with a keen understanding of human nature and are able to think and talk fast are rewarded rather than those with clever strategy. The game closely mirrors life with its undeserved failures and unexpected successes. Diplomacy is a great game.

Having said all that, the game does encourage "negative" behaviour - you *will* be forced on occasion to lie, use coercion or threats, be forced to trust an opponent known to be lying, etc. These aspects are all part of the rough and tumble of the game (which some love and others loathe). Finding 6 players is near impossible, so I rather recommend the excellent 2-player variant Intimate Diplomacy. ID removes the lying, back-stabbing and other negative aspects or 7-player Dip, but retains the rich game play. Its also takes less than half the time to play!

While this game can be incredibly unpleasant when all players aren't equally commited, if you find the right group of people to play with, it's amazing. Some of the deepest, most intriguing strategic and interactive situations I have ever experienced in a board game.
This game is NOT for everybody and you should play with people who don't find it interesting. I recommend researching the game and maybe try a custom game online to feel the mechanics for yourself.
If this game IS of interest to you, it might be the most fun you've had.

A very pure game with virtually no luck and simple rules.  It's all down to the negotiation, and which country you play can affect that.  Played this loads of times at uni, sometimes well into the night.  A deserved classic and I only wish that I still had the time to play it now.  I know some will say that it is too cut-throat, but hey, as cut-throat games go this is brilliant and deserves it's high score.  Besides, if you play too aggressively, you're never going to win anyway!

I hate this game.  It's totally evil.  There might be some redeeming aspects of it design-wise, but it's very mean-spirited to play.  It's basically a "let's all lie to each other" game.

RATING: 1
The single worst game ever made.

As a "wargame," it is an epic fail: it takes place in the early 20th century and Austria-Hungary is as just as likely to be allies with Russia as they are with Germany.  Yeeeeahhh.... Not.

Combat-wise, it gets worse: I have 2 meeples and you have 1, so I win.  Yep, that's it.  Because never in history has a numerically inferior force won...ever.  Terrain advantages?  Russian winters?  Non-exsistant.  And it has a stacking limit of 1.  And get this, the quality and quantity of troops are entirely the same: Russian meeples are the same as German meeples.  Yeeeeahhh.... Not.

So how do you play?  You get together and discuss secret plans with the other players to have your meeples gang up on other meeples, because that 1 stacking limit makes it tough to conquer anybody by yourself.  Really?  Yeah, so the only way to win is to have 2 areas attack one area.  Somewhere along the way, you may have to lie to one of your allies, because you want to rule Europe.  That's pretty much it.

Now, why do I call these "meeples?"  Because this isn't a WARGAME!!!  It's the first Euro.  Consider what they have in common: cubes (at least the version I once had contained cubes), a lame-brain pasted-on theme that has nothing to do with reality but rather is a way to teach the "mechanics", and the most important common denominator: dreadfully dull game play.  Oh, and did I mention this "historical" wargame gives Russia a stronger army than Germany -- in the early 20th century?  BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!  But if you don't do that, Russia will get knocked out early.  That, chilluns, is called a "balancing mechanism" which is prevalent in Euros.  Yeah, it has player elimination, but hey, this was the first Euro: it was pioneering the genre.  Even the Eurogamers knew this sucked and required improvements, so they kicked out the conflict and kept the rest.

This "game" came about when Satan pro-created with a Kansas Jayhawk and the two most evil forces in history combined all their evilness and put it in a box and thrust it on the world.  This "game" is akin to the videotape in the movie "The Ring" (or "Ringu" if you saw the original).

If you want a war-based diplomatic-style game, go play Origins.  If you want a game that involves back stabbing with interesting theme and more realistic game play, go play Battlestar Galactica.  If you want a WWI-game, go play something like Paths of Glory or Guns of August.  Heck, go play Castle Risk.  All of them beat this game.  If you can't find them, just give up the WWI idea, and go play something else.  If there are no other games possible, just give up gaming at that time and go do something more enjoyable, like pull off your fingernails with a pair of pliers.  

I imagine that the 7th level of Hell is a small room with no doors or windows, and the KU fight song is blaring over speakers that are built in the wall and protected.  A game of Diplomacy is set up on a table, and seated at that table are Justin Bieber, Pauley Shore, Fred Phelps, and Barney the Dinosaur, and they have patiently been waiting for the final player to join them, and now they can share eternal damnation with you.  ARRRGHH!!! It makes me puke just to think about it!

So there you have it: this game is so bad, that I wish I could give it a "0," but since I cannot, I went back and re-rated my other "1" games "1.1" when I don't do fractional ratings.  However, I wanted to be perfectly clear without any room for confusion or misinterpretation that this is worse than all of the others.

Is this game "broken?"  Yes.  It's broken because it breaks everything around it: it breaks your joy.  It breaks your innocence.  It breaks your will to live.  It's a broken game because games are [i]supposed[/i] to be fun.  If you stuck needles under my fingernails and called it a game, you may claim it's not broken, but I would beg to differ, and I would rather have you do that than subject me to Diplomacy.

I have a saying that dinosaurs can make any game better.  I am wrong.  I think Diplomacy brought the extinction of the dinosaurs: they died of boredom.

I am ignoring the phrasing for what the stars mean. 8 is "very good - enjoy playing..." this is not necessarily a game I 'enjoy'. Both times I have played someone has ended up crying. A different adult person each time. It is ruthless and upsetting. But is a masterclass in game design. The massive flaw however is no ability for alliances to win. We've never completed a game as the requirement for one player to win half the supply centres is too much.

A brilliant game system. But it is very confusing when you don't know who you can trust... Besides if you are just two players playing it (GBR, RUS, FRA vs. TUR, AUS, GER) you either have to randomize the allegiance of Italy or you will definitely have an absolute stand off, where no one can progress, after a while.

My first game of this was really rough. In 12 turns I had 6 instances of "allies" backstabbing me. The turns where I had an ally to work with were enjoyable, but they were outnumbered by the frustrating backstabbed moments. The game design itself might not be too bad, but I rate games in terms of how likely I am to want to play again. 

It's possible the game was made worse by the fact that we played with 2 day, online turns. This took most of the human interaction out which probably would redeem this game. I'm open to trying it at some point in the future in person possibly, but I don't think the online implementation is for me.

Diplomacy is a game best played with 7 players. Each player represents one of the Great Powers of Europe in the years just prior to the Great War, (World War I). England, Germany, Russia, Turkey, Austria-Hungary, Italy and France. Each is independent of the other. At the start of the game, the players draws to determine which Great Power each will represent. As soon as one Great power controls 18 Supply Centers, that player has "gained control of Europe". Tactically, this is a very simple game. Since it has two types of units; Armies and Fleets, each with the same basic abilities and limitations. Strategically this can be as complex as you wish to make it. Remember: you don't represent a soldier or sailor or general or admiral. Each player must be an imperial leader, a politican, an ambassador.

Expected playing time is about 4 - 5 hours.

You better like negotiation. That seems obvious, but you will not have a good time otherwise, because that 95% of what the game is. Not only that, but it is basically impossible to win by yourself because of how deterministic everything is, so you need help from others and they need it from you. Alliances will naturally form, and finding the best way to bend those to your advantage (or eventually break them) is the crux of the game. I adore this, but if you find yourself on the wrong end of a broken promise it can ruin your game and you'll find yourself sitting around for a while. This game absolutely still holds up, but I think there are probably ways to modernize it a bit as well.

Played many games over the years with a tight bunch of friends.  I'm still mad at one of them for stabbing half of the table in the back.  Maybe some of the most vivid and funny gaming memories come from the vicious game-ending gun-to-the-back-of-the-head moments when the orders were read.  My buddy saved a bunch of posts and they're hilarious to look back on.

  Chess mixed with Risk that has all the dice thrown away. Such a great game if you have a weekend to spare and don't really need to sleep. 
  
  Write down you orders, watch the others write down theirs, hoping that your diplomatic agreeements remain intact then reveal... The inevitable back stab that leaves your nation in tatters and you spend the next 13 hours as a vassal nation until you can eventually stab him back.

  An awesome game that takes so long that it can't often hit the table and many refuse to play due to the emotional involvment, I now play an online version with strangers, this method works really well as you can't can't see who is chatting to who.

A devilish classic, so basic in its rules, that might be considered a rite of passage for gamers.  (Everyone should play it at least once.)

Not sure I have ever completed a game...they typically tend to disintegrate into (amusing?) fits of anger by about the fifth turn.

Avalon Hill (Feb. 1982 / 2nd Edition) #819
Clearly the best 7-player strategy on the market.  This game is not for sensitive or weak gamers.  This game requires alliances to be made and broken throughout the game. The mechanics of the game are very simple (only 2 types of game pieces - armies and fleets) but the skill required to excel game after game is daunting.  Highly recommended.  Once you buy and learn the game, then the game becomes truly international in scope and will allow you to interact (via Internet; not included in the boxed set!) with die hard Diplomacy players from around the globe.

As a game it is not horrible obviously, but I don't like games that heavy on aggression element and even less so about games that are heavy on backstabbing element. As diplomacy is very heavy on latter and also a very long game, I have hard time imagining a game that I'd like to play less. 

If I ever come up with one, I'll re-rate Diplomacy as a two-star game.

The low rating is for game length, the fact that people can be knocked out, the potential bad feelings generated by the built-in backstabbing, and for needing a big house with a lot of extra side rooms to really play this one properly :)  But the old system still holds up and is as slick, and as mean, as ever.

Love it or hate it?  One of the most divisive games out there.  With no luck (except for which country you draw), this game relies entirely on your diplomacy skills.  It's extremely intense, and it's hard not to take betrayals personally.  It's best to play repeatedly with the same group.  If you just play once, there's a large incentive to screw over other people.  By playing repeatedly with the same group, that incentive is reduced -- keep screwing over people, and everyone will gang up on you.

Also, probably best not to play this game with family members or significant others (if you want them to stay family...or significant).

This might be the best game ever made.  :-P

Perhaps I am merely lucky to have friends who know to keep the game in the game.  

Also, my most favorable games have been play-by-email with people I see on a regular basis in real life.  This gives it an interesting tension to the decision to stab, since I DON'T have the luxury of anonymity, but still get all day to plan, scheme, and conspire with everyone in the game.  Interestingly enough, this gives the game all the emotional impact of face to face combined with the chance to plan optimal moves.  In my opinion, it's the only way to play it.

And played that way, it is the nail-biting game to end all nail-biting games.  This is elegance and tension in board game form.

I admit this game has many flaws. It takes a long time. It includes player elimination, and I expect 1-2 players to be eliminated in the first three hours. It plays best with seven. And it's really only good for certain types of people. But it is a pure implementation of the negotiation/political mechanic. Yes, there are rules about the fleets and armies on the board, but they are almost irrelevant, merely venues for adjudicating the real game, which is in every player's head. And it's brilliant.

Beautifully simple mechanics combine with tons of negoiation to guide players up to and into the Great War.  Depending on the game play, it may even lead to World War III.

I feel I SHOULD give this game a 10, but going off of BGG's rating system, a 10 would mean I want to play it ALL the time. That simply isn't true.

This game really requires the 1900 variant to balance it properly; my review is technically for the 1900 variant since there is no reason to return to the original.

I love this game and how it forces negociation to the fore! Also it is a game that allows players to be just plain mean... but in a game context: that's good! Getting enough people who won't take double-crossing too seriously can sometimes be a challenge (I never tried PBEM). The time limit per turn tempers the negociations from getting out of hand. The suspense and surprises as the simultaneous movements are revealed is the best.

I have the Bookcase version with wooden pieces and a still shrinkwrapped version of the new AH edition.

Got a second copy for $2 from local Op-Shop (Cat Protection). It is unplayed (pieces still joined together) and I've got to assume it's the 1982 edition as it has a 1982 Avalon Hill catalogue in the box.
In fact my original copy was a sale copy bought in the eighties from Angus & Robertson. Reason for price reduction was 'missing pieces' but there had been an additional full set of pieces added to the slightly deficient set, so I actually have double complements for most nations (16 armies, 16 fleets) with 12 for Turkish and French fleets and English armies, with the French having to settle for the original complement of only 8 armies!

I really detest Diplomacy. I used to like it, back when I was younger and didn't care so much how I treated others. This game is absolutely and only about lying to other players. Eventually, you will have to do it at some point in the game. You will manipulate and lie, and you will be purposefully manipulated and decieved. If that floats your boat, this game is for you. I find it potentially destructive of relationships, meaning the small group of gamers can become smaller because of the playing of a game. That can already happen because of any number of other misbehaviors that may occur in gaming. No reason to put a game on the table in which relationship destruction is the main tactical tool.

Még csak kóstolgatom a játékot. De ennyiből is látom, hogy nagyon megelőzte a korát! A sunnyogás, szarkavarás játéka ez, ahol végig észen kell lenni, és a parancsok kiadásánál a precízség is fontos. 7 nagyhatalmat irányítanak a játékosok, összesen max 34 egység van a táblán. Első hallásra talán kevésnek tűnik, de...
---
A játék táblája első osztályú, és az egész küllem valahogy nem illik bele a "régi", múlt század közepi klasszikus társasjátékok sorába (Monopoly, Risk...). Ez nem hat ósdinak, inkább patinás. Kifejezetten szép játék!
---
A 4 személyes játék nagyon nem jött be. Talán igazságtalan emiatt rontani a pontszámon, hisz nem véletlenül 7 fővel ajánlott, de mégis, annyira rossz élmény volt így 4-en, hogy szívem szerint kb. 4-est adnék:) De közben meg 7-en nagyon jó... Sajnos pont az alkudozás része nem jön így 4-esben ki, pedig nem is a szabály szerint játszottuk, mert az igazságtalan nagyon (egyik embernek csak 1 ország jut)...

I would give this an 8 if I could just find a group to play it with me!

RATING: 6
Throughout my highschool and college years I played countless hours of this game. Knowing when to trust your opponents and when to "alter the arrangement" was the key to doing well in the game. This version of the game has a nice antique look and feel to it which I vastly prefer to the older editions. I only miss the wooden components from previous editions.

You're hungry, but all that you have is a dried up, shriveled prune that is well past its expiration date. If you eat it, you'll be occupied with discomfort for the next 4+ hours and you'll have learned at least one lesson after recovering. You'll now know to leave such ugly and mildly poisonous things alone.

RATING: 9
A perfect blend of psychological and strategic gameplay, Diplomacy is my favorite game of all time. It is not a perfect game. The game is very long, there is player elimination, and it can take some time to get comfortable with the concept of physically writing orders. Despite these flaws, it remains my favorite game of all time.

A long game, easy to explain, and best with the full complement of 7 players.  Easily broken by someone giving up before it's over.  Your moves are highly dependent upon what you think the other players are going to do.  I'd rate this much higher if I could play it in no more than 90 minutes.

Feels more like a social game since most of the time you are in discussions with other players.  This game would definitely be better via email, but I like to play games in person.  As for gameplay, I found the negotiating to be fun, but the actual progress on the board was painfully slow moving.

One game PBEM under my belt and I enjoyed it.  I doubt I could ever handle playing this face to face, unless it was over the span of a weekend and other games were played in between but... It has a nice mix of very basic battle mechanisms and a great deal of smooth talking to allow victory.  I am hoping that in subsequent plays that there is more chatter and backstabbing and less all out warfare.

I have yet to find a game with more strategy and less luck.  I have only played two games with a full seven players, and that was only accomplished via email.  The game format lends itself very well to email since all orders are executed simultaneously.  A face-to-face game is supposed to last about six hours.  Our email games have lasted about six months (playing one turn per week).  This game practically consumes my thoughts when playing by email since there are so many options to consider to the point that my wife is annoyed because I only talk about Diplomacy.

Very involved all the time.  For more info www.diplom.org is by far the best source I have found for Diplomacy.

YES!  This is definitely one of my all time favorites.  Yes, it does take a long time.  Yes, a full compliment of opponents makes it ideal.  Yes, you can be eliminated and sit out for many more hours.  That all comes with the package, but what a package it is!  Aside from the starting empires, there is absolutely NO randomness.  All successes and failures hinge on your ability to cajole, lie to , and/or brainwash your opponents into seeing things your way.  You HAVE to walk into this game knowing you will be stabbed in the back, and probably by your best friend.  It's just part of the game, and you have to deal with it.  Are you wily enough to sense when that will happen and have a nasty trap laid for the unscrupulous turncoat on the right turn?  Or will you show your hand too soon, creating distrust in the most innocent suggestion?  Get big too quick, and everyone wants to knock off the big guy.  But don't grow fast enough, and the buzzards start to circle.  Classic!  If you want everybody to be friends and end with a 7-way tie, this is NOT the game for you.  But, if you wish to test your diplomatic skills, knowing that your friends may hate you for years to come, then this is the game for you!  [Market price]

Good news...bad news.  
The bad news is that this copy looks like it has taken a hard fall on the upper right hand corner:  Bottom box corner is split and wrinkled; corner of lid is nearly split and wrinkled down the side for approx. 3 inches; the corners of the conference maps are wrinkled; and if you look close, you can spy some minor wrinkling on the corner of the board.
The good news is that this game is unplayed.  Conference maps are still attached as a pad, all four clips to hold map sections together are present, as is the original rule set.  Finally, all the pieces (WOODEN) are present and accounted for...still in factory sealed bag.  Shoot, even if you're not a big Diplomacy fan, those 112 wooden playing pieces are quite a draw.  I almost kept this set for myself, as I learned the game with the wooden pieces, but maybe someone out there would appreciate the game more.
Traded away at GameStorm16 math trade for Justinian.

RATING: N/A
Wonderful condition of this classic.  WOOD PIECES!  Upon counting, this set has the correct number of pieces (112), however, there is an odd count (intentional?).  All countries have 8 army blocks, and all but two have 8 fleet blocks.  Turkey (yellow) has 9 navy blocks, while France (turquoise) only has 7.  As it looks as if this game was never played, or only played once, these seem to be the original blocks that came with the game.  Go figure.  Board is in great condition, and box shows minor shelf wear only on the corners.

Great game but unlike modern games this takes ages and it is almost impossible to make a decent come back if you get behind.  The negotiation and deal making are both its biggest strength and its greatest weakness as they lead to a very long game and a game in which there will or should be a lot of double crossing.

Old school diplomacy in game and by name. Negotiations and backstabbing. Lots of it. More Backstabbing. Not for the faint hearted, very hardcore. Game can take a while. Technically a wargame but feels very euro.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Surprising depth out of a simple mechanic, and great interaction. But it's a long game where people drop out early, created in the bad old days before designers learned that games could be fun start to finish for all players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This game it's more than a board game, because, as the title tells, diplomacy is really the basic of the match. You have to talk, reach agreements, secret pacts, but be ready to avoid traps and betrayals. Remember: Diplomacy player can identify themselves a lot in real diplomatic, and they're willing to do everything to have their Country rule! Diplomacy has many expansions, but I think the original board and the ancient Mediterranean Sea are the best.

RATING: N/A
I am not comfortable with a design that forces you to betray an ally, or allies.  This whole idea of stabbing someone in the back, by design, is not my idea of a fun few hours.  I like the concept of political and military movements, but not the betrayal.  I have seen students turned off of wargames, or what they think are wargames, because of Diplomacy.

My first exposure to a proper game with all skill and no dice. I was hooked from the first day I saw it.

As I learn that the designer Allan BC has died this week, I was prompted to revisit my rating and comment for this game. I am somewhat ashamed to have written so little, mindful that this game is substantially responsible for my enthusiasm for board games. The mechanic is simple the depth is as deep as it gets.

The only problem with Diplomacy is that you need so many people to have a good game. Once you do round up enough people, though, nothing beats it. You wheel and deal your heart out, but you can never really tell what's going to be revealed when the actions are declared.

We set 7-10 minutes per negotiation round, and then play out the orders. It makes for enough time to tie most things but doesn't go on for too long.

I LOVE the negotiation. I'm the kind of player that loves making deals that benefit both parties but mostly me :D

This game would be an 8 if it was faster/shorter. It's what I'd rate the online game at playdiplomacy.com
The physical game, though, I cannot rate that high, as I can hardly ever find another 6 players, time and place to play it. And even then, someone is probably going to resign because "he's getting screwed". A 6 it is

I've been a fan of Diplomacy since college. I love social deduction games because of the bluffing and insight required when engaging other players. This takes my favorite part of social deduction and turns it into a war game. If I can find people to play a full game, I always do. I end up playing this online a lot, because it's got a pretty small, dedicated following.

A vile exercise in all modes of conduct that should be discouraged in humans, and banned in gamers.
To win this game, you lie to your friends for the momentary benefit of winning a game.
With this line of reasoning, whats wrong with the next step........ a little cheating.
I last played this back in the 1970s when I was young and immature, with others who were young and immature, and saw it ruin friendships.
It is a relationship breaker.

This is a great game but you could lose friends playing it. I have actually developed a play style in which I never lie and always give fair warning before a change in alliance.

Not without reasons is Diplomacy the classic it has been for over than half a century: it has depth and interaction without being overly fiddly. It’s just a little difficult to grasp at first, as granting and negating supports is not always as intuitive as it looks.

Alliances, betrayals (both intended and unintended), rivalries and paybacks just add some spices to the fun, as they make interaction the core mechanism of this game (which, being it titled «Diplomacy», is to be expected): sadly though, since it is the key element, interaction also drags the game and stretches it overly too long.

Firstly, this game suffers immensely from Analysis Paralysis... i.e. players that take F-O-R-E-V-E-R on their turns. This is the reason I will not play this game.

Secondly, too many people get angry over the eventual, and pretty much required, betrayal they will face by the end of the game.  Alliances (i.e. Diplomacy) are often what help you win the game... but if you want to win the game as a single player, that means you WILL betray. This isn't a problem for my group, but it is for many.

Diplomacy is part of the history of war games!! An astounding game!

RATING: 7
On a purely sentimental level, Diplomacy is probably my third most-loved game, after Axis and Allies and Euchre.

It's my primary link into the world of organized boardgaming. I'm associated with the Potomac Tea & Knife Society (http://www.ptks.org/), although I no longer live in the DC area. My favorite regular tournament is DixieCon, run by David Hood in Chapel Hill, NC. (http://www.dixiecon.com/) 

I strongly prefer face-to-face to email/judge play (e-communication is too low context for me to enjoy.) If played online, I prefer gunboat (no talking). 

Both the simultaneous movement and non-binding negotiation aspects of Diplomacy appeal to me. I'm a "Survivor"-contestant-wannabe, and those two aspects of Diplomacy present strong parallels to what attracts me to the game of "Survivor".

A game i WISH I had 6 other friends who would play it more often. Have a new gaming group now, so maybe it can come out of the shadows of the past now! One of the greatest gaming experiences you can wish for (regardless of what you hear, we've never thrown punches or had harsh feelings, just laughs & memories). I've even used it with my soccer teens, tho w/ a turn limit so not to completion, more emphasis on cooperation and the need to help others and vice-versa. We always ended before too much backstabbing could occur. Good teaching tool, if done right!

RATING: 5
I like the idea of a 'war game' without no dice whatsoever. However, this game is basically 90% lying to your friends. Like bold-faced, "I swear to god I'm not lying" type of lying. And it goes on for hours. I can see how feuds are started over this game.
Best played with strangers. Under no circumstances should you play with your spouse!

May be the only game I've ever played that didn't depend on luck of the roll, but still one of my favorites.  One of the best player interaction games out there, but they don't call the "friendship ender" for nothing...  I've found it best played with teams of players for each nation--this increases the uncertainty about whether or not a deal will be honored.

RATING: 6
Remarkable game of alliances and, ultimately, betrayal set on a map of Europe prior to the First World War. Notorious for causing rifts in friendships when players begin their descent into betraying allies. That this is a game of skill seems to add salt to the wounds. Fun, but needs a group that can set aside their feelings. (Wood block AH and Metal AH/Hasbro versions.)

RATING: 7
I must have played this game hundreds of times, primarily when I was in high school. Diplomacy is almost entirely a social game. It is most enjoyable when played with the same people multiple times over an extended period of time. Succeeding under such conditions requires you to manage your reputation over time, which is the key element that makes this game fun. Namely, how can you screw over your partners without getting blamed for it?

RATING: 9.5
This is one of the best games I own or have ever played. If you like highly social, strategy games, give this one a shot.

Pros:
-No dice! It's like Risk (based on world domination), but you aren't left to the mercy of multiple dice rolls.
-It is very social. In order to last even a couple rounds you must form alliances. This is the games major appeal for me - everyone is interested in forming alliances.
-You have to break alliances eventually. This is why the game doesn't get boring - anyone can turn on you at any time. How long do you trust your allies?
-Moves are made simultaneously. I like this mechanic - everyone writes down their rules, so there is no waiting for your turn; it's always your turn.

Cons:
-Time. I have managed to organize about five games of diplomacy in the many years I have had it. Unless you have a dedicated group of game players with enough time on their hands, it is difficult to find people to play this game.
-Difficult rules. It takes a long time to teach the game to new players.
-Move resolution is a lengthy process. It can take a while to resolve everyone written moves. If the players aren't competitive, they will quickly lost interest in the part of the game.

The pros heavily outweigh the cons for this game, if you have the time and right group of players.

If they talk about "The Game" then they are talking about Diplomacy. 

No luck, no dice, no turn order, no random machanics whatsoever. More than enough variants or types of gameplay to satisfy anyone. Am amazing game of negotiation, strategy, trust, truths, lies and double deals. 

Playing Diplomacy on the net in late 2006 got me back in to boardgames. Playing Diplomacy face to face at a con for the first time in 2007 was an experience! That led to Boardgames and BGG.

The number of UK players is back on the up as I (and players like me) did something about it...

A very 'nasty' game - you need to negotiate to win, but you'll have to back-stab as well, which means everyone knows all the negotiations are likely to be not worth the paper they are written on. Game runs too long and has player elimination. Doubt I'd play it ever again.

RATING: 6
Hard to rate this one on the BGG scale. Definitely a classic worth 10 on many fronts, a near perfect rendition of simplicty and elegance, it is not a game so much as a phenomenon! Yet I can'trae it 10 which says: "Always want to play and expect this will never change". That's just not true. 

The reality is it's a long game, hard to play well, highly entertaining but also very draining at times and emotive with treachery at its very core. It suffers the dropout phenomenon, as in you can be eliminated and have nothig to do, or just as bad all but eliminated and an army to push around. 

So while it is nearing perfection as a fantastic game, it's also a real chore to play and doesn't find much place in my life. So I can't give it more than the 6 which sates "will play sporadically if in the right mood".

Juego de negociación pura. El escenario es europa con 7 potencias (francia, uk, italia, alemania, austria, turquia y rusia) en primavera de 1901. Hay dos turnos por año.. primavera y otoño y cada uno tiene una fase de negociación, otra de establecer ordenes (se escriben en un papel ocultas) y luego ejecución.  No hay dados ni azar en absoluto. Todo depende de cómo seas capaz de negociar con el resto de los jugadores y de los compromisos a los que llegues. 
Al final de cada año, hay un recuento de puntos de producción y un ajuste de las unidades. No hay combates ni bajas (normalmente). Me gusta porque además incluye un número muy reducido de fichas..

Altamente recomendable para 7 jugadores. Yo, además de la vez que acabo de registrar en la bgg, la jugué hace tiempo en otras tres o cuatro ocasiones y siempre triunfó. Influye en gran medida el talante de cada jugador. 

Recomendable: Evitar perfiles tipo sergio.

Played it a few times in college and loved it, but that was more for the bribes that could be offered in exchange for help in the game -- "If you support my army into Germany, I'll totally make it worth your while later."

Some games help me to understand the real world through a new lens. Diplomacy is one of those games. It helped me understand the complexity of diplomatic negotiations and the ever-present possibility for someone to renege (or be won over by a different offer) to disastrous consequences. Really well thought out game. 

You must utilize your neighboring countries to win. But that might also be your demise.

It can take a long time to play. I often use the online version for this reason, but settling down for an in-person conversations adds a different dimension of acting and deceit.

RATING: 8
RULES: ***** - The rules of the game strike me as very clear and easy to comprehend. The artwork in the rulebook may seem a little bland, however, it is effective at explaining the main concepts and it's not difficult to understand the mechanics of the game.
STRATEGY: ***** - The planning aspect in this game is huge. Every country has a lot of intermediate objectives to choose from, and choosing the right allies for these objectives are crucial. Careful planning is very rewarding in this game.
TACTICS: **** - The tactical choices may be a little bit restricted, because the units do not offer much variance in the game, however, every once in a while situations arise, where a wise support or attack may catch your opponent unexpectedly.
LUCK: ***** - There is absolutely no luck in any form of randomizer, which I find an awesome feature as I prefer to be outwitted by my opponent and not by my lousy dice rolling (which is seriously lousy) or tile drawing. Of course, you may not always outguess your opponent, so there is definitely some luck in the game, but at least it's controllable.
PLAYER INTERACTION: ***** - Player interaction here IS the game, its body and its soul. Order resolution and battles on the table are just a minor addition to the great psychological wars that roam during negotiation. CAUTION!!! Please do not forget, that Diplomacy is just a game. Treachery in the negotiations is but a part of it. If you take it personal, with all due respect, you're an immature prick.
REPLAYABILITY: **** - The games do have some repeating patterns in them because it is quite a bit analyzed all over the Internet, however, litterally thousands of variants of this game will keep it fresh for you even if the original game will lose its taste for you.
THEME: *** - The battle system is quite a bit unrealistic and usually provides no deaths in the battlefields (most of the armies diperse because of lack of supplies), however, on strategic level it simulates linear warfare quite good, and the diplomatic aspect of the game is simply great. Overall it does feel a bit too abstract.
BALANCE: *** - Since the map is not symetric, some countries are stronger than others. Personally I find Italy and Turkey very dull and Austria is simply a cannon fodder. Despite that, I have seen all of the countries play successfully, it's just that some of them require quite a bit more effort than others.
DOWNTIME: **** - You have a lot to discuss during the negotiation phase. Sometimes you have so much to cover, you run like mad from person to person. Order resolution may be duller though, because it's just a lot of mechanical work pushing armies and fleets around, however, it's still usually fun to watch how everything folds out, so it's bearable.
ACCESSIBILITY: ** - This game is insanely long and requires insanely many players. Quite frankly, you almost don't have a chance to play it as a board game, however, this game is more than suited to be played as PbeM. Actually, I find it at least ten times more fun that way. A turn a day instead of a turn every 30 minutes will make it quite a bit easier to find seven players.

I *still* haven't gotten this damnable game on the table -- and I've owned it for nearly 20 years! I'm a bit frightened of the prospect, truth be told. It has quite a reputation as a friendship-ender.

2/25/2010 - Finally got a game in! This was a full 7-player game, and it wasn't nearly as confrontational as I thought it would be. This is partially because we went into it with the right attitude (with the foundation of "everyone else in this game WILL betray you. It's not a question of 'if' but 'when' this will happen." It was a fun game, and I think everyone else in the game group enjoyed it as well.

I've played Diplomacy a few times, and while it's an excellent game, it takes a lot of time, and it's rare to find exactly seven players (it's really best for exactly seven) who all have the time and inclination to play. I successfully traded for my copy with another BGG member. Yay!

I think to be a true gamer (not something everyone who enjoys playing games should or needs to aspire to), one has to master the play of Diplomacy, and should at least win from time to time. It's sort of a trial by fire that everyone who aspires to grasp the Zen of gaming should pass through and master. It teaches you (sometimes brutally) all the skills you need to be a good social gamer: the ability to both play quite competitively and still walk away from it at the end of the day as just a game, realizing that winning isn't that important; the ability to assume a role in a game that is not you, and appreciate what's happening in the game as important and interesting but apart from you as a real person; and the need for constructive social interaction even within the confines of what is a cutthroat game, and that being a jerk is no more productive here than in any other reality. And of course Diplomacy is a masterful game in and of itself, with simple, easily-grasped rules that enable a tremendously rich game experience. I particularly like how Diplomacy games evolve an interesting narrative and do so organically, without the "plot coercion" common in modern games (especially the card-driven games like Here I Stand or The Napoleonic Wars, even with all their strengths).
---
A true classic which everyone should play ... once, at least.  Must admit to being a little surprised about the length compaints; I once played 3 games in one day (not somthing I'd recommend), and games took about 6 hours - long enough to be a problem, admittedly, but still faster than many American games (Junta is longer, and has a fraction of the content). Still, it hardly needs to be stated that the nature of the game will change dramatically with the players, and players who can't separate games from reality will not be desirable to play with. Still, many years ago, this was the staple of my gaming diet. Rather long by today's standards, has a rather sever player-elimination problem, can be arbitrary and a bit vindictive for the kinder, gentler gaming generation; but for a negotiation game with an international power-politics feel, it can't be beat.
---
Edition Notes: Basically, to get a good copy of this game, you need to go back to the old Avalon Hill bookcase edition with the wooden pieces. Most other editions of this game have been crap. The plastic pieces (stars and anchors) that Avalon Hill introduced in some editions were strange, and were so small they made the board look vacant. The "new" AH edition, that used the Monopoly cannons and ships for pieces, was actually fairly nice, but the gargantuan box was a bit of a downer. I kinda liked the Gibson Games edition with garish colors and the bullets for pieces, but more for its brazenly tacky color choices than anything reasonable. The new WotC edition has a nice price point, but the pieces are not great; at least it's a small-ish box!

RATING: 7.5
By far the most enjoyable way to lose friends. :)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
This is my favourite board game of all time. The complex strategy aspect (while still easy to learn), the secretive deal making (and deal breaking!), the nerve-wrecking order resolution phase where things fall apart before you're eyes, and the sweet revenge of a well-played stab in the back - these are all things that make this game very awesome.

On the downside is the fact that it takes at least 6 hours to play, and that's if everyone is experienced. And it can easily take longer, especially if you play all the way to the end (which you don't have to). While I don't mind playing long board games, most of my friends do, and so it's really difficult to get people together. And the game really only works if you have all seven powers represented. So you need seven players - no more, no less. But when you do manage to get the time and the people together it's one of the best board game experiences you can have.

It's also great to play online asynch, either via e-mail or through a website.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
An absolutely phenomenal and engrossing gaming experience. It's hard for me to imagine a game that is more emotionally involving than this. The only downside to me (and the reason I don't rate it a 10) is that the end game can be a bit of a drag. There can occasionally be situations when there are only a few players remaining in which the players are simply trying to outguess opponents or when there are stalemates in which it is impossible for either player to advance (baring someone seriously screwing up their moves). 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The perfect diplomacy game, it's pure negociation.
No randomness will come and ruin your day, it's all about interraction with other players. 
Rules are really simple, interactions are at the maximum, but the game can be quite long.
It's also a real brain burner and there is a lot of room for very clever/crazy planning and backstabing.
It's the kind of game I don't rate because I feel they don't fit in the BGG rating. It's a perfect negociation game, but I don't really want to play it as it's not my thing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
In the beginning, there were wargames, RPG and Diplomacy.  Dip stands in a class of it's own.  Fully deserves the title it shares with real diplomacy, "The Greatest Game."  Brilliant mechanics on the board, and even more spectacular off board, because it really takes place within player's minds.  It is the essence of all multi-sided games boiled down to the essentials.  Excellent face to face, but reaches its highest potential (so far) in anonymous online play.  Like any game, can get repetitive after repeated sessions.  Having time and the right mindset are absolute requirements for enjoying the game.  Played well over 100 games of this.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
It isn't merely a game, but a genre - and for some, such as me, a hobby. In elegance and sophistication it's right up there next to Chess. And a whole lot more enjoyable and satisfying - though Chess afficionados are bound to disagree.

There are literally hundreds of variants. The Standard map is excellent, but I'll argue that the 1900 variant surpasses it. Anyone into Diplomacy, owes himself checking out 1900.

That said, Diplomacy isn't for everyone. (But then, Chess isn't either). For the full experience, you have to have the right sort of players.

Further, this game works brilliantly per email. Indeed, I argue it is thus "purer". Face-to-Face and PBEM are quite different and both great. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The marathon-length play time and player elimination mechanic turn a lot of people off from this game.
But if you've got seven players determined to see it to the end, there is no game finer.
I personally love the complete lack of luck, other than what you can make for yourself by working out back room deals with your fellow players.

A beautiful, elegant game; one of the greatest games ever devised.  Simple rules, straightforward mechanics...but ever so hard to win.

My favourite all-time game, but the problem with this is finding enough other people who are willing to play. Does not work as well with less than 7 players, in my opinion.

[04 August 2007] I recently went to a games convention hosting a diplomacy tournament. Although I intended to participate, I didn't play any diplomacy all weekend. Maybe it was the early start to the tournament games (9-9:30 am), maybe it was the apparent intensity of the other players. Maybe I was nervous, having not having played anything but online for several years.

Anyway, I feel obliged to change my rating from a 10 to an 8, even though I still have a very fond attachment to the game. Obviously, I no longer "always want to play".

Everyone should try it for the experience, especially non-gamers.  Not everyone will want to keep playing it, and that's OK. I would never play it again under any circumstances I can really think of.

I played the game once and could just never get into it. I know some folks are madly addicted to it. It takes too long to play, for what you get in return.

If you like lying, duplicity, selling out, and second-guessing, this game may be for you.

Diplo is a powerful game.  It lives in a particular space of social interaction that few other pastimes reach; it has the innate ability to destroy friendships.  The incredible thing about Diplo is that it takes two opposite ideas- co-operative play and ruthless, cut-throat competition - and combines them in a simple, abstracted ruleset.  Is it an enjoyable gameplay experience?  I don't know.  Diplomacy sessions seem to transcend being just a game and becomes an Event.  You look forward to playing it with an eerie mix of dread and wonderment.  So while the game itself is excellent and rates perhaps an 8, it deserves much respect for the environment it creates around the table.  It could be argued that there is no greater political simulator.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I have a love / hate relationship with this game.  With the right group and with time limits enforced, it is a good game.  The no-dice resolution system is clever for such an old design.

However, if you do not enjoy getting backstabbed and are not willing to enforce the limits, the game can become way too slow and hateful.

Online however, this is a different story, and the game would probably play much better.  I heard there is a facebook app that plays this.  If I ever get a facebook page, I may verify this.  :)

The classic no-luck war game.  I love the map, and the concept.  However, in practice, the game (for me) is very dry.  You go negotiate with people (often not in good faith) and the write down your orders.  I appreciate the game, but don't necessarily want to play it.  For me, A Game of Thrones does it much better, and is much more interesting.

One of the longest, most strategic games there is. There is no randomness to this game outside of which country you start as. This game takes easily 7-8 hours or more so it is something you have to set aside a whole day for. 
My main complaint with this game is that everyone has to come and be totally prepared to try their best to win. If anyone is uncaring, it can totally ruin the whole game for everyone and with something this long that is no fun. Be prepared to plot, scheme, make alliances, and be brutally betrayed. Be ready to make and lose friends.

On reflection, I admire the hell out of this game but if I'm spending 8 hours gaming with people I can think of a number of other ways to spend that time.

This is a great game that is flawed in three respects:
1) it requires 7 players. Yuk.

It caused me to have a lot of nervous energy - nervous to make sure I wasn't missing something obvious and nervous because I wasn't really sure what to do and why.

Requires a lot of time and dedicated players, but the interaction (meaning the lying, backstabbing, and empty promises) make it a true gem.  Makes up the majority of my best gaming memories.

Keep me away from this game. Depending on who your playing with it can be a 2 or a 10. I'm a political crack addict. Negotiation games are perhaps my favorite. I'm usually giggling like a maniacal fiend at the start of this game. I am so confident in this game its got to be megalomania. On the other hand the chances of getting a successful game finished is remote most games seem to bog down.

I really want to like this game. I really do! There is no luck, only strategy and planning. Socializing with friends is a must if you want to do well. 

The only problem is you NEED 7 people to play the way it was meant, and more importantly, they all have to WANT to play. This is a hard thing for me to come by, so, I can't rate this game any higher.

Still one of my favorite games of all time, even though I don't play it much (tough to find 6 other people who like it and have the time to play). Have started playing it online. The benefit of online is you can act without having to worry about getting friends mad. The problem is you can't "read" your opponents. Love the no luck aspect.

Diplomacy is a game best played with friends who can take a knife in the back and still be amicable afterwards. The rules for the game are fairly simple, but they function well. The real game is in the negotiations with the other players. I've found this one is best played via online correspondence.

For me: The best game ever!
Even though: it is so hard to find the people to play it, it is unbalanced, it is unfair, it is mean ... oh - I love this game!!!!

And for me, THE game, that was the gateway to boardgaming. I had my first game being eight years old (back in 1977 - oh my!) ... Visiting my Sister in New York, we actually played it with also some professional diplomats ... it was an amazing expirence for me - even though I drew Austria-Hungary ... and ended up with only one army in Trieste. Of course all the adults where feeling quite bad for having me beaten up so bad - and offered all kinds of pacts and support - but I decided to move my army in the adriatic sea - rather commiting suicide, than to survive only upon the mercy of others. But deep inside, I swore to play better in the future! 

Great, great game - where we had the most amazing roleplaying going on around this game, with spying, hiding under the table to burn up the negotiation-map during the negotiations of the opposed alliance ... so everybody had fun. but also I had several quite serious rounds, where the hard negotiations went on and on ... great, great game ... the best game I know - so simple rules, so much depth - and so much open space for players to create their kind of game, while playing it.

There is a lot of obsession around this game. It's a great deal of fun and one of the first board games I remember playing outside Monopoly and all of it's various spin offs.

In terms of elegance and simplicity, Diplomacy is a standard.  Classic negotiation game where you play the other players instead of the game.  I think playing online is much more manageable but backstabbing someone online is a little different than looking into their eyes while you do it!

I own 2 garage sale copies, both 1971 versions.  I paid $8 for the first one, and considered that my best buy of the garage sale year.  I paid $2 for the second one.
I have only played the game to completion once.  The second time I played we didn't get the rules quite right, and we were adding new units to the board after every round instead of every second round!  We abandoned the game once I realized we were playing it wrong.
This can be a very long game.  And feelings can get hurt.  It's a serious, serious war game.

There's a board but very few components so not really getting much for your money

Needs people with thick skins (and with something to do when they start getting eliminated).  Still, the tension is massive and the pleading, whining, cajoling, threats, and promises, make it a blast.

Flawed but beautiful. Just such clean lines.

We've found the best way to play is to get exactly 15 people together. 2 per country (3 is too many because one player will sit out, and if you're alone it's easy to get offended) makes 14, and 1 dedicated referee to read orders and fulfill them. At that scale, you're always going to have new players, and it's important to have the ref read over the first few seasons of orders to avoid feel-bads when people submit impossible moves.

Online is a completely different game and totally absorbing, but it's too much for me these days.

Diplomacy is certainly a seminal game for wargamers.  the concept that one can have a wargame without any randomness (no dice, no paper scissors stone) is a great one, and for that I appluad the makers.  My reservations about Diplomacy are that the rules are hoorendously conplex and quite innaccesable for a new group of player to get to grips with.  Some rules even seem self-contradictory when one reads them for the first time.  The game take a VERY long time too, which puts a lot of people off; lots of friendships can be put to the test during a game!  

Getting over all of these difficulties will leave you with a highly engaging game though, one that all serious gamers should take time to try.

Some don't like this game because of the possible (and likely) treachery aspects. I don't mind this "issue" - it's an vital part of the game and adds to the tension when playing this sort of "negotiation"-games.

My grief is a different: The game takes so loooong! And, while a long play time might not be a downside in itself, it is very likely that some players will be eliminated in the course of the game.

The combination of both: expanded playtime and elimination is, what distracts me from this game! It is almost unplayable in private gaming groupes, as sooner or later one player will be excluded.

("Diplomacy" might be interesting to play on a gaming convention, when you may easily find another group to have fun. But then, it simply might last too long for this occasion, too...)

One of the best games of all time.  Pure genius.  No crazy dice rolls.  No phone book thick manuals.  Armies are equal in strength and the only way to win is to convince some sucker to help you.  What a victory in gaming.  One downside to this game is that it really only works well with a total of 7 players.  And in addition, it also suffers the same fault of all FFA (free for all) games; players give up.  Even if they are not losing, once they "believe" someone has the advantage they tend to stop trying.  So good games suddenly end.  Good team games help prevent this!

RATING: 9
Best game ever!  Pure-strategy and negotiation, no dice or cards.  The only problems I have with this game are....  You need exactly 7 players who can be dedicated to the game for the entire day.  Players must leave the game as a game and not bring in outside influences or hold grudges after the game.  My experience is that most people cannot handle it when someone lies to them and will throw tempers and/or quit the game, which then throws off the balance of the game.  If you have any newbies in the game, they are always getting their written orders wrong which really messes up the game.  I am generally willing to act as game master (an 8th player) to run the game, collecting and validating orders, providing simple help to newbies early in the game, and acting as time referee.

This kind of game is fun in limited doses, but Diplomacy is a very long game entailing one negotiation after another, with multiple betrayals throughout. It's exhausting. I prefer the face to face negotiation to online play, but ultimately the length kills it for me.

I love this game. 

The fact that it uses no dice means that little is left to pure random luck.

I have played it a couple of times "live" with the players around the table but I enjoyed it much more when I played by postal normal mail (not e-mail).

Playing by e-mail withe a human umpire is also good fun but not as much as by snail mail.

Diplomacy was one of my favorites in college;  we had these marathon all-nighters where one by one countries were taken over by their neighbors.  I love the pure strategy and &quot;diplomacy&quot; of this game.  Much as I love Axis &amp; Allies and Risk, there is something to be said for a game that has no reliance on luck.

RATING: 5
Ultimate negotiation game. The on-board mechanics are simple & bland and all the action occurs out of the room. Devestatingly boring if you're eliminated or sidelined early. 

I'd only ever play this by email these days. Or in a blitz-style with no secret negotiations and time-limits (effectly as an abstract wargame). Anything else is prolonged torture.

RATING: 5
Likes: No luck factor, lots of intrigue and deal making, (I find myself really getting into the role of a diplomat from the particular country I am playing as), metal components are well made, is suited for play by email.

Dislikes: Needs the right group to play well, would rather play other meatier games for the amount of time required to complete a game, player elimination leaves some players feeling left out, writing tons of support orders each round gets tedious.

The ultimate friendship destroyer!
This game is a classic.  Easy to learn, a lifetime to master.  There is a fantastic community of gamers around this game.  I used to play tournament and Play By Mail Diplomacy back in the day and I have the mental scars to prove it.
Diplomacy is very much like Chess, but between 7 players.  It has its opening moves, counters, etc, and the character of the game unfurls, but with a non-binding 15 minute diplomacy period between each turn which is where the real action happens.  It is a lesson in trust, learning how to read people, detecting lies, and, ultimately, how to accept defeat and betrayal, which makes the winning games even sweeter.
Having a thick skin is mandatory.  Holding grudges is something best left at the door.  
Trust no-one!

Old classic, but has several strikes against it. You need seven players, the nations have unequal chances to win, and it takes a degree of deception and nastiness to win.

But I will say that Diplomacy is something every serious gamer should try at least once. It's a seminal design.

Strip off all the chrome of a multiplayer, wargame and you have this.  Excellent game that I've only been able to play twice (once was via email).  It all comes down to your ability to negotiate and convince others to attack someone else.  This is really the core of most multi-player wargames.  A lot of those games try to pretend to be something else (ala Twilight Imperium)...but it all comes down to diplomacy.  Why bother with a game like TI3, just play Diplomacy instead...there's more action.  If I could get a group of 7 to play a 6-7 hour game of backstabbing and player elimination, this would be in my top 5.

I play frequently by forum. I also own a vintage copy of the game but have only managed to play once, and we didn't quite finish.  I greatly enjoy the tactical calculations, and seem to do fairly well at this game.  This is very difficult to organize and play in person, so my rating includes the consideration that it can be played online over a longer period of time. Also, I think I prefer taking the time to work out my moves carefully, and you can be pressed for time to negotiate and calculate in a live game depending on the pace.

Awesome wooden blocks and a deluxe hard board map. The game follows the usual Diplomacy rules. A lot of discussions going on on who will support whom and who will be back stabbed. Decisions are written down for moving each army / navy block and revealed at the same time for all players involved. Some will be puzzled by the results others surprised and a few betrayed. There are no dice rolls and rules are very simple. If you are in for intrigue and backstabbing this is your game.

A great game if you have 7 players and all day to waste.  The mechanics are brillantly simple and the secret negotitating can be really exciting (I think more fun with friends than strangers).  You can play with 6 if you have to, but anything less is just plain dumb.  The biggest problem is once you get back stabbed and put into a weak, losing position, you are still in the game with your few pieces and then have the choice of wasting more of your time doing basically nothing, or quitting the game leaving your troops in civil disorder which has some impact on the game which is bound to piss someone off.  Haven't played in years, but wouldn't mind with the right people.

RATING: 10
I love this game.  The designer said he took elements of two of my other "10" games: Chess and Poker.  It has the strategy of Chess and the player interaction of Poker.

This is the game that led me into Eurogames and Ameritrash.  It has elements of both (balanced game play, no luck, wooden components (my first version) AND player elimination, war and conquest).

The best game invented in the 20th century.  It has been around long enough and still has a big following to show it isn't a fad.

The design is genius.  They key to remember in this game; it is just a game.  You can't take it too seriously if someone backstabs you; just think of it like a bad roll of the dice, and move on.

It is best played with seven, so it has a unique status as a "Strategy" game with me.  It is my favorite specialized strategy game in that you need the right crowd, the right time, and the right amount.

It is an excellent game to play on-line, as it was often played as a mail game long before the internet came around.

The classic game of negotiation and tactics; the former being much more important. Play your opponents, not the board. Either loved or hated by anyone who plays it. Obviously I'm in the latter camp.

I'm not the kind of person that likes to give 10s: I am a being of change and can't say that I'll always want to play this. But right now if there's one game in my collection that makes me think about giving it a 10 anyways, it's this game. I love Diplomacy. No game mixes tactics, strategy and pure negotiation so well together.

Unfortunately, base game pretty much requires 7 people, with definite constraints on what kind of people can handle it, so it's hard to get this played in person. But online Dip is it's own beast and an absolute blast when you're playing with a bunch of other competent, lyin', schemin' dirtbags, even when things don't go well. Which they often don't... 

My favourite game.

I've owned this game for about 4 years now and never got a game of it in. It's simply too hard to get a group together who's willing to get a play in.

That said, it's a great game - I've played online and the layers of careful negotiation and planning are brilliant. Best to play it with patient, level-headed people who'll take rumors with a grain of salt - so many lies about one another. Also so much better when you role-play it up a little - don't need to go crazy, just get into the theme.

My brother has this game.  It's o.k. but it takes people who are all playing to win.  If a couple people team up and aren't willing to take each other on, then it stinks.  It's great because it's pure strategy (no dice), but some of the countries (like Turkey and Russia) are definitely better than others (like Austria-Hungary). - - We've developed some standard sheets that you can print and use to write orders too, which speeds things up a bit and ensures that everything is clear.

RATING: 6
Simple but deep game of alliances and negotiation; I admire the mechanisms of the game.  But it is too dependent on backstabbing; the game’s free-form alliances seem somewhat broken.  If a strong alliance sticks together for most of the game, they are not very beatable, and there seems little incentive to backstab due to overlong game length, since games almost always end before two players are left. The game also takes too long to negotiate with everyone, and the “bouncing” mechanic can get frustrating and lead to many stalemates.  Not a very playable game in face-to-face gaming due to game length and player elimination (it is far better via email, but very intense).

Love it or hate it every gamer should play this at some point. I mostly play online these days as it works well on a  PBEM server. THis used to be the family game in my house when i was growing up. Mostly ended in tears from me or my brother (we started playing it around the age of 12). I played though my teens quite a bit. Maybe due to the ages i've played it at, or its mechanics, i've seen more people get physically upset playing this game than any other. I suspect this is due to lack of randomness. In other games when your beat you can accept that the cards didn't go your way or what ever. Here you know you were just bullied out.

RATING: 10
This is a truly beautiful game.  Deterministic but with Incomplete Information, resulting in an exciting, excruciating, unpredictable game.  So compact, only uses a few simple tokens, but has unlimited replayability.  One of the few games that utilizes stalemate as a mechanic, and for that reason alone it stands head an shoulders above the crowd. I like all strategy board games, and love many, but Diplomacy is my favorite by far.

Eerily, (and I can't really explain how this came about) when push came to shove, and my friends and I pulled out the knives, we were all either emotionally bothered by the impact it had on us, or on other players at the table. Something happened. Despite the fact that we knew going in NOT to take anything personal, it stopped feeling like a game, and started feeling like what would happen if people were really acting this way.

We didn't like causing each other to feel that way seriously, even though it was just because of things going on in the game. I've realized something about games from playing Diplomacy, that "it's just a game" only carries so far. Even though I really, really appreciate the uniqueness and structure of this game, I'll be surprised if I can really bring myself to play it again. I used to be the person who said "If your friendship takes a hit over a game, what kind of friendship was it really?" It's just, in a way, it stopped feeling like a game. And it just wasn't the kind of game I ever wanted to play again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
This game is a great and classic game.  However, it is simply to long and that turns many people away.  I really enjoy this game but it is too long and too mean.  I like war games but they can bring a lot of frustration and fighting.  If this doesn't bother you.. than go for it.  Risk is good because it is quicker. Diplomacy is more a game of "diplomacy" and not war like Risk.  It is a deeper strategy game for gamers that are more mature.

RATING: 4
Fair. Unfortunately it is not consistently interesting across the length of the game.  It is best at the beginning, when the powers are more-or-less equal and the negotiation is sharp.  After a few powers have been eliminated, the opportunities for negotiation are cut at least in half and often more: usually the lines are drawn and obvious, but you still have to play it out or accept a draw.  The game system itself is perfectly-suited for the beginning of the game, where it should be simple so as not to overcomplicate the diplomatic aspects, but towards the end of the game it is too simple to hold up on its own.

The best diplomatic game ever. Only warrants a "10" with all seven players. Find an older edition if possible.

Arguably the best territory-acquisition game of all time.  I love it to death, but it suffers from some major limitations: (1) takes forever to play (2) plays best with 6 or 7 players (3) it's an elimination game, so you can get knocked out early and be uninvolved for the rest of the party.  It's probably best played in an office or online in a "one turn per week" format.  If you liked this, check out Game of Thrones.

A game that shows the importance of treating games for what they are. If players go in to it with the realization that they may be betrayed, fun can be had by all and no friendships lost. The best of the negotiations with backstabbing genre. I have combined the 1999 version with the 2008 one to have metal pieces combined with the nice board.
-
After finally playing it in person, I found the game very intense and engaging, but I am not sure if it is worth the effort to convince other people to play a game where most of us are going to be feeling betrayed by the end. I still want to play it and enjoyed this play, but I will likely be trying to play other games before this one.

RATING: 8
El juego en mi opinión es extremadamente interesante, sin embargo para que tenga el mayor potencial de diversión, tienes que juntar a las 7 personas para las que fue diseñado... Las variaciones para menos jugadores no son malas, pero luego es dificil lograr que las alianzas varíen o que haya traiciones, etc, porque tu mismo te puedes ayudar con otro de tus países.

Otra "desventaja" es que sí es pesado... puedes tardar demasiado en un juego (hasta 8 horas de hecho) que incluso podría terminar en empate.

De ahí en fuera el juego está muy bien pensado y diseñado, por algo es un clásico.

Il mio 8 è un tributo alle centinaio di partite fatte e di ore spese per questo pezzo storico (io ho l'edizione originale).
Il gioco di per sé è molto poco moderno: lento e un po' ripetitivo nei primi turni. Inoltre, è un classico rovina-amicizie in quanto si basa sul presupposto che ci si tradisca.
Detto questo: divertente!

Brilliant, elegant, rich in tactical and strategic play, and because of the human component, the most challenging game I have ever played.

Really enjoy this game, yet I only play it online through Diplomacy judges.  I do not have much desire to play this one face-to-face.  The game is much more measured and analytical if played through correspondence--in the early design process for this game, communication was written.  Maybe at one point I will play it face-to-face just to see what the experience is like.  This game is not as backstabbing as believed; trust plays a bigger part than deceit in this game.

I am not that good at games that rely so heavily on negotiation.  Not only that, my one play took up most of a Sunday.  I decided to unload this game.  Couldn't be talked into playing this one again.  Too many other games that play in the same length of time, but which I enjoy much, much more.

I've never finished a game of Diplomacy, and therein lies the game's greatest weakness in my eyes. It takes too long. Without some sort of way to limit the time between turns, this game won't hit the table at all. When it does though, with the right crowd, it's pretty good, but I don't expect to play this ever again. Stabbity-stab-stab.

The only thing stopping me from giving this game a higher rating, is that fact that due to how long it takes to play, and that fact that its best with 7 players, it makes it next to impossible for me to play a game of it.  Not really the games fault...but still..if i had 6 other friends who liked it and who had hours and hours and hours of time and patience to play with me, then it would be a lot higher

Diplomacy is a very good game of negotiation.

In order to win you need the other players' support, so you'll spend your time trying to draw plans and make deals with them, while keeping an eye on who they talk to and what they seem to be planning. Will you really be able to trust them or will you end up with a knife on your back? Your negotiation skills will decide it.

The downsides? It plays best only with exactly 7 players and it eats too much time, 4+ hours. But if both conditions are fulfilled, this is a game that really shines.

Can be amazing, but any game will lead to at least some of the players spending the best part of the game doing very little, and it can drag on, so should always be played with a timer for the negotiation phase (10 minutes is about right). I have many fond memories of playing this as a teenager, but nowadays if I wanted a similar but better experience I would play something like Game of Thrones: the Board Game.

RATING: 7
I love and hate this game in equal measure. I find playing it a real rollercoaster and no other game has pi**ed me off as much.

But then I keep coming back for more. It's the way the game draws you in. There is an emotional involvement because of the very direct player interaction and their inter-reliability. You can't win without the help of others but these others are also trying to win for themselves.

It's a simple area control 'war game'. But the real meat of the game is in the diplomatic negotiations and the eventual lying and back stabbing that follows. There are not many tenser moments in gaming than when the orders are revealed.

I'm learning to be a better loser.

Played this via email 2 times and in person once with strangers. Elegant, and true negotiation game that I enjoyed much more via email.

Great game of deal-making and deal-breaking. A ton of fun, and serious to boot! The only problem is that you really must have the full contingent of players. Also, you have to remember that it's just a game: I've heard of people who won't speak to each other after having been stabbed in the back during a game. 

One caveat: this game is loooong. If you've got all day, and people committed to playing it, it's great - if not, then don't bother.

Great game.  So fun.  Some games try to add diplomacy on all of their fluff, but to quote someone else, "if you want to play Diplomacy, play Diplomacy".  It's not too hard to learn, but newbies make game-altering mistakes often.  Best played by email, as getting 7 people together for long enough is much too difficult.  

I used to rate this higher, a 7, but you really do have to be in the right mood to play this game. It is too long and stressful for me to play regularly.

There's a lot to like here, but so much to hate.  The rules are elegant, the negotiations are fun, but as elegant as they are, the rules are seriously flawed.  I almost want to rate the game as a 1 (broken) but I could be convinced in the right mood, to play again.  The rule problem, is that I've never played in a game that went to conclusion (and while I know it can happen, it's very rare, even in tournaments)--people always give in to a team win of some sort--yet the rules specifically do not allow that.  Besides that flaw, people can get knocked out--what do you do then, you've been invited over for a game, that can last 12 hours and you're out in hour 3.  Which leads to the other problem, it plays waaaay too long.

exellent game. require strategy and diplomacy. players negotiate between themselves but yet they can lie and stub your back when you get weaker. the game is builded to players talk and do "buisness". the war the tactic is very simple, yet has a lot of deapth to it. the players reveales the moves that they wrote on paper together so part of the game is to forsee what player will do what and should you count on him or not. simple, exellent, wonderful, great. 

update: ratings went down, no more favorite of mine. too tense. too long for my taste right now. i prefer to invite people for less time and still play 2 games.

rating again went down to 8.

Yet another update: i played last night diplomacy again. i didn't play for a long time becuase it takes so much time. ahhh wonderful game! i love it! again rating went up!

I have played this game once upon a time back in my youth, but I don't think I would ever do so again.  Certainly not with people I consider friends.

It's a game that seems purposely designed to bring out the worst in me as a gamer, therefore I simply won't play.

RATING: 6
As a game, Diplomacy could rate a 9 in my book- simply because it is a "pure game", in that it relies completely on the players, while the only luck that exists comes from the fact that your fate rests in the balance of the other players' intentions. Not many games live up to their title as well as this classic. 

Unfortunately, because of the negative side effects regarding diplomatic engagement,  necessary backstabbing, and very long playtime (6+ hours), some are put off by this experience. Many friends are lost over this game, which is also why I bring my rating down. The game can be a fun or miserable experience, depending on the nature of the players and what happens to them. But a game like this deserves at least one try by everyone!

RATING: 5
My complaint about this game is based on the fact that I rarely if ever got enough players together on the same night and at the same time to really play the game. I know that PBM was possible but I never got into that so the game except for a very rare occasion sat on the shelf and gathered dust.

RATING: 7
[b][i]Diplomacy[/i][/b] is a no-luck war game that requires strategy, negotiation, and (often) backstabbing to win. It's a long game (5+ hours), and it basically requires 7 people to play. Consequently, games are rare and provide experiences to be treasured. Because of this, Diplomacy is not a game so much as it is an event. The hours of play leading up to a moment of strategic brillance and, perhaps, a betrayal make every game memorable. Diplomacy deserves a higher rank, but it sits here because of the difficulty of getting it played.

Many have maligned Diplomacy because of the back-stabbing element. The synopsis of this is that the game allows players to make non-binding agreements and then people sometimes get mad when other players do not follow through on the agreements. If people cannot handle this in a light-hearted way, then they shouldn't play.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Absolutely no luck involved, except at the very beginning (chosing your nation).  Not a game for everybody, very long, 7 players (almost) mandatory, but Diplomacy is definitely the purest boardgame there is since it's all skills, no luck or dice throwing.

A cut-throat game of backstabbing and betrayal.  What more can friends want?  No luck of any kind, extremely simple game mechanics, the game is all in player interaction.  It is very easy to take the game personally though and hard to get 7 people to commit to 4-7 hours of gaming.  Use a timer for turns!!

We never played with a full player count, and we never had the time to finish a whole game. So maybe my rating isn't really fair. But hey, if a game is only good with a huge number of players, and 5 hours to play it, that is not my kind of game.

In spite of it's length, Diplomacy's intrigue and player interaction make it a winner.  However, this must be played with the right people in the proper mood.

Outstanding negotiation game.
Like Junta : perfect to loose friends.
But it has generated so many analysis & session reports that the strategic options do not seem so broad... Does game variety suffer from experience ?

RATING: 7
[Original comment] A great old classic, but plays best with six or seven, and takes a bit of time. Also, not good with players who cannot accept backstabbing in the spirit of the game.

May 2009 -- It is likely that I will never play this game again, but I enjoyed it so much many years ago, that I consider it a collector's item and will keep it.

RATING: 8
The classic negotiation game - players are the heads of European nations around the time of WWI - each player secretly make deals with any and all other players to oppose, support, and back stab and all is then revealed in your written orders when your real intentioms become clear.

The game requires a dedicated goup and a long time to play. It can suffer from the usual Risk game problem of king making although turtling is less of an issue.

If you have the time and the group - excellent.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
I think this game has been eclipsed by others that use its diplomacy, non-dice rolling mechanic.  Even though I like the principles of the game in general you need too many players to play it and the game is so darned stressful that I don't find myself wanting to play often.

I find that the game plays much better by e-mail and actually plays the best online with people you don't know--having plenty of time for negotiations (days) means that calculations are less chaotic and stabs are better planned and less emotional--the game takes on a little bit more logic.

Something like Game of Thrones completely fires Diplomacy for me.

Finally, I don't know what else to say other than that there are some poor design problems like the common stalemate positions in the game.  I suppose you could argue that all the players usually know about them so it's not a problem but I still think it is a problem.  Add in the unbalanced starts which I am normally fully in support of.  Some players in a vastly better position than others and game design has to come into question.

The original temporary alliance game. You can't get through the first two turns without an ally, but you'll have to stab that ally in the back to win. Learn to be nasty. An all-time great game; rated 8 because it .. takes .. all .. day to play.

2/19/12: FANTASTIC game.  Love playing it.  This version has beautiful metal pieces -- far more intriguing than the wooden boxes in other editions of the game.  (Although, I think I prefer the cleaner and greener maps of the other releases).

11/17/15: Haven't gotten this to the table in years due to the length and the logistics, but still scratch the itch online for time to time. Tremendous social game that requires creative strategic and tactical thinking. Really forces you to determine your mid-term objectives and map out flexible paths to get there.

Played it once during the winter of 2009. It took a long time (three or four Friday nights). We pretty much just got board of it because it stretched out over such a long period of time. Before this we had been playing a game of risk every Friday night but then I convinced everyone that it would be fun to try this game instead. Long story short we never ended up finishing the game and never got back to doing our Friday night risk games either. I really did like the rules though.

The ultimate classic wargame... more than Risk!!!  Risk is just that; grab five dice and lets go.  But here there be no dice to rely on.  You and what you hope to be victims of deceit are all you have.  Wits and skill at timing are your weapons and what weapons.  Some of my friends never liked it because it was too close to exposing real character strengths and flaws.  See your therapist after playing or look at your and their reactions: classic.  I love it and love it more and more.  PBEM is the way to go, no one is hurt... well not too much.  OK I owned it three times and each time one of them has got water damage.  I'm about to fork out for the Hasbro ed.  Sad sad days.  Get the original if you can: wood rules.  It's a grandpa to A Game of Thrones.

Vicious game and tough on friendships but it is fun to play.  Lots of strategy in guessing other people's moves and not letting them guess yours, as well as timing when to stab.  Unfortunately, the base game is not balanced. (Poor, poor Austria).  However, alliances and self-interest can help overcome a lot in this game.

A tough game to play just because of the effort needed to get that many people together for that amount of time. And then once accomplished, the play isn't that exciting.  Play is all about negotiation and back stabbing which can be problematic depending on who you play with. If a player is out, he's out for the game doing nothing but spectating which is incredibly boring. I'd say, everyone should play this game at least once, but once that box is checked, I doubt people will beat a path to play it again.

This game is all about what takes place off the board - negotiation, alliances and backstabbing. Takes 5-7 hours to play, many friends refuse to play ever again due to backstabbing necessary during end game. If you fall behind early you can't recover and must grind out hours of boring play. Consequently one must be very careful writing out their moves - no mistakes. Best with 5-7 players.

Don't understand why this isn't given a higher rating on Board Game Geek. It's absolutely enthralling. It's a game entirely about people. Yes, it promotes backstabbing ... but that constant tension is what creates the interesting social dynamic! An outstanding design. Simplicity in action!

A classic, but it takes a long time and it's difficult to do well without being a little backstabby.

I love this game, but you really have to play-by-email to pull off sophisticated and awesome moves. Also, the slower pace of email really makes it feel like you are maneuvering armies around Europe. On a board it's very fun, and the "no-luck" aspect makes it really intense. It will take you about 8 hours to finish this game face-to-face, and after a few hours some people will be eliminated, so not a "friendly" game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Brilliant in its unqiueness. Unparalleled in its ability to turn friends into enemies. This game not only requires exactly 7 people to be played at its best, it also requires them to be thick-skinned enough to see it as "just a game." I have no problem with games that have backstabbing within the game rules. But Diplomacy requires exploiting peoples trust OUTSIDE the game. It's metagamey at best, and outright lying at worst. I am really surprised by how many people find this type of game appealing.

Good in th days but not nowadays.

Multiplayer only (need at least 4). Interesting mechanics and very subtle game system. Maybe a bit too simple (boring) and still lacking flavor.

A brilliant game of pure negotiation. Not so great face-to-face as it suffers  early player elimination (usually 1-2 players get squeezed out early on).
I used to enjoy playing in tournaments and via mail - however I think email is the best format for this game - provides an optimum mix of player interaction, diploming and turn around time.

I possess two version : one used copy with the plastic ancre and star pieces and the latest Hasbro/Avalon Hill/Wizards of the Coast edition.

This a game that needs two things in order to succeed : dedication and a tough skin. Dedication because learning it takes a long time, the games are long and you have to be an active participant throughout.

A tough skin because it's very easy to feel betrayed, frustrated and generally being picked on by the other. Keeping it cool, detached, unemotionnal is a requirement if you want to be able to enjoy a game.

Not everybody can play this.

It is not necessarily bad.. i see what it has to offer.. it's just that i do not enjoy backstabbing per se.. and backstabbing you have to do a lot, if you wanna win.

Furthermore it takes ages...! My playgroup started really pumped up about it.. but after 4 hours where everyone betrayed almost everyone the faces were getting long.
At that point you ask yourself what am I doing here..? Is anyone enjoying this right now..?

Not me, but it certainly has a following.

come on, it's just a game fergossake.

The game is good. It just takes too frickin long.

We played this a lot back in high school, but we were never able to finish an entire game due to curfew. Years before, a family friend gave me his copy of Diplomacy. This was the Games Research, Inc., edition from 1971. However, the copyright was 1959. Plenty of good memories, although the games were incomplete. We even ventured out to creating our own variants, such as "Fantasy Diplomacy", which was scribbled out with permanent markers on giant butcher paper. Nostalgia rating: "8".

It's just too hard to get seven players together these days, who are willing to spend 6+ hours back stabbing each other, just to get a stalemate?

It is a landmark design: no luck; winning is based on pure skill based on negotiating, manipulating, and collaborating. Do I want to spend 6+ hours scheming and clawing my way to victory? I'm really not that good of a liar, or a negotiator, and I don't like to piss people off, so this doesn't work for me. Current rating: "6".

Diplomacy is incredible.  The combination of the elegant, deterministic, simultaneous order resolution system and the open or secretive negotiation of human players is ingenious.  Perhaps, without annoying practical issues, it would be the perfect game for me.  However...  Practical issue 1: 7 players!  Practical issue 2: a whole day to play!  Practical issue 3: if both of the above are solved by means of the internet, the game lasts for weeks and I become obsessed like some sort of drug user, wasting countless hours of time poring over the current situation and pondering tactics...  People always talk about making the perfect "Civilisation in a couple of hours" game.  For me, it would be "Diplomacy in a couple of hours" which, of course, is impossible...

You can't say it was luck that did you in, after getting hosed in Diplomacy you *know* you have been hosed. No dice, no spinners, no cards, just mano a mano deal making and deal breaking. A number of my game friends won't even play this one after getting whacked so hard. Best played either with people you know and love (and will forgive), or with people you will never see again.

Unquestionably a classic piece of game design, this often works better in theory than it does in practice. Ostensibly this is a negotiation game, the problem is, there is little that can be usefully negotiated with a liar. This means that rather than being a game, Diplomacy is really a metagame that essentially consists of the players collectively deciding who, at the table, will be the next player to be picked on and eliminated. When this happens, there's little that you can do, no amount of argument or skillful tactical play will save you and unless you survive the first round of eliminations then Diplomacy is no game at all. Small wonder that some resort to cheating, either approaching a game with a pre-arranged alliance with a trusted friend or playing more than one nation in a pbem game under different aliases.
As you can probably tell by now, I'm sharply conflicted as to the virtues of the standard game. I've had some of my finest gaming moments at Diplomacy, in amongst hours of boredom and misery. I'm no fan of the standard map as it tends too easily to stalemate, some of the small map variants (see 'Hundred Variant' for a good example) eradicate the above issues and so represent a huge improvement, as well as removing the obvious practical problems (the need for 7 players and a playing time so insane that the vast majority of games end as some form of draw). At this stage of my gaming life I'm pretty much done with Dip, but new players should try it, a few times at least.

Some of my most fond gaming memories are based around Diplomacy. I can remember playing games of it at college, where we would all submit turns twice a day and discuss moves during classes. I can remember multiple other games where we would show up at someone's house and play until the wee hours of the morning, getting angry at each other for betrayals and then immediately offering to ally again as soon as the moment was right.

I can also remember that I've literally never finished a game. I've also had people who got mad enough to not talk to me for days afterwards, and while I'm sure the majority of that blame is on me, I can't help but feel that the game brings it out of people as well.

It's an experience that I think everyone should have at least once, but I honestly don't think it's a very good game. Mechanically it's nothing incredible, and other games can fill a similar niche in far less time.

In short, I look back on Diplomacy fondly, but I would not recommend it as a good game, and would also be unlikely to play it again.

Very tight heavy negotiation based board game which i like the point of view the game has. The player elimination and the time needed for the game is the worst parts of the game and should be solved by house ruling. I suggest short game variants for playing.

Just played it twice, but it's THE game. Sadly it isn't easy to find a good group to play it, but the game is everything a good game should be. Every game designer should know that the way to make a good and funny game isn't any rule or mechanics, it's to let the player use his skills to make the game go as he wants to go, or better so, as he thinks the game is goign where he wants it to go, while every other player thinks the same. This game, with Illuminati, is the best at this point, and therefore, they both are my favs and absolutely a must have for everyone.

Only play this game if you want to lose friends.  Seriously, I played this one a couple of times and I enjoyed it.  The game works best when you have 7 players however.  I was controlling two countries and trying to play each with seperate agendas.  I gave myself a nice headache for three days from that one.

The reason this one is not played more often is due to the length of the game.  With 7 players, it is going to be an all-day campaign to play especially with the secret meetings, backstabbings, and general taunting that is sure to go on.

I would love to try this one as a Play by Email.  This seems like a perfect for it and the extended time between rounds will allow for lots of dealmaking and backstabbing.

Wow!

I never thought it would happen, but I've found a second 10 to go along with the one I gave to Settlers.

I can't say enough about this game.  The level of player interaction is off the charts.  The game isn't played on the board it is played when you play with the minds of the other players.  The tension right before orders are revealed and the sometimes jaw-dropping moments are truly priceless gaming moments.  

Just a note about the playtime and the bitter feelings which are the two most common complaints.  This game is in its element in play by email where it truly shines.  This perfectly suits people like myself who have a family and can't easily get people together for one hour of gaming let alone 8-10 hours.  Secondly, please play this game with the right people.  Don't play with your spouse.  Don't play with anyone who is prone to not being able to separate the game from reality (they will see your in-game stabs as an indictment on your real-life character).  Playing online tends to solve this problem as well.

Do yourself a favor and go play Diplomacy online - NOW!

Way too long and unsatisfying. Hours of "dude, help me attack X and move away from Y"--no thanks.

Three neighboring countries. All three make deals. All legitimate deals from a strategic standpoint. All mutually exclusive. One country, therefore, must get screwed. I've been on both sides--the winning end was not really that satisfying, the losing end especially so.

I don't like the feeling of implicit collusion that pervades. I don't the think meta-distrust is part of the game. Or IS it... bwahahaha. Ahem. Just too many other fun things to play out there, without spending 24 hours on a 3-way win.

I played this in the '80s.  The first time I got really, really hosed by someone was the beginning of the end for me.  Somehow, the serious hosage didn't happen right away.

Well, the game is aptly named; it is the archetypical game of diplomacy. Some people like diplomacy games, some don't. I used to like it, but these days, "diplomacy" to me mostly means broken promises, pathetic whining, backstabbing, lying, and that stuff just isn't as fun as it used to be. Still, I can't deny that the game is a pretty nice piece of game design.

RATING: 10
A masterpiece and perhaps my favorite game of all time.  The game is about human dynamics and human nature - pure strategy and negotiation with no luck (other than perhaps choosing your starting power).  The rules are remarkably simple and logical, and the simultaneous movement mechanic not only offers exciting gameplay, but also much more realistic than turn-based war or civilization games.

The game is at its best and most delicious in the first several turns - as everyone is still in the game and still has dreams of world domination.  The greatest thing about the game is that even as a small power with just 1-2 supply centers left, if you negotiate wisely and shrewdly, you can still maneuver in the game to regain influence and power, and perhaps a chance to win the game.

While postal / mail games are popular, I greatly prefer face to face games since the time commitment is actually more manageable - face to face games only usually take a day or a weekend, while online games that span months end up feeling like a second job with offers sometimes written like contract legalese.

Now, I understand the game has a reputation, but I believe they are unwarranted and comes from playing the game incorrectly.  I've hosted and GM'ed countless all-day face to face games, and we've  never had anyone leave the house with any fewer friendships than they arrived with.  As I tell all players at the beginning - Diplomacy is a game - what happens in the game stays in the game; nothing is personal.

Moreover, I do believe you can win this game without backstabbing.  The fact is, I have done so myself.  You need to work with other people in order to win.  And you don't have to make any promises that you can't keep.  The best players know that the meta-game is just as important (or more) as game strategy, tactical play, and transactional stabs.

**NOSTALGIA RATING** 

This is a fantastic, lovely game. It enthralled me for years as a kid. Loved the interplay, the intrigue, the betrayals, the strategy, the cunning, the screw ups, the blown orders, and my first run at a programmed command structure in a board game. 

Very long with a full boat, wonderful for play by mail games, will consume you if you play it well. 

Direct confrontation and treachery is required to win...no ifs, ands, or buts about it. You can not win without turning on someone at some point since every country has multiple fronts to defend quickly...aside from the Witches that is.

I've always called Briton and Turkey the Witches for some reason (it had something to do with the corners...). Boil and Toil...You have 3 dark prophecies coming Hamlet. 

**THIS GAME IS NOT FOR EVERYONE*** Be warned, but it was my only "10" at one time in my life. Simple rules, tons of straight strategy, wonderful double think and 'reading' of players, offers, and the straight board 'truth'.

Love the metal pieces (and the fact that there are enough of them!) and the supply center ownership markers.  Just wish the map was a bit bigger, and the conference maps had the full names on it, not abbreviations.

Just make sure you keep the thing UPRIGHT position when you carry it :P

Has 1971 Games Research Ed. rules with it, so not sure if that was put in as substitute and it's really the 1961 ed. or what; but the box indicates it really is the '61 ed (old-style American address in corner).  Love the wooden pieces; just wish there were more of each color so you do not run out as you get closer to victory! Very nice large map which folds in half! Another downside: no supply center ownership markers, as the 1999 Hasbro ed. has.  Like the AH 1985 ed., there are only 8 army blocks and 8 fleet blocks per player so you might run out as you get closer to victory.  Unfortunately this has never been a problem for me in Diplomacy :(
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I love the plastic stars (armies) and plastic anchors (fleets) because unlike the wooden blocks they do not obscure the names of the supply centers the way they sit upright.  Minor downside however: unlike the 1999 ed, no supply center ownership markers, which I personally find rather useful.  And again, there's only 8 armies and 8 fleets for each color so you might end up running out at some point.  But of course, I generally get eliminated before then anyway! :P

A great game, with a simple and effective mechanic.  The only downside is the lack of control that each player has in the first 1/2 of the game; it is very easy (in fact necessary) for a player to get knocked out early, regardless of their relative skill level.

The standard map is hardly "balanced", and it's tough today to find 6 or 7 players for a 5 hour + game.  Still, this is the "Creme of the creme" if you like negotiation games.  Remember - if you have to trust someone, it's already too late!  Always negotiate from a position of strength.  A single player win requires you to do some serious backstabbing at some point.

Single player elimination and game length make this "cult classic" very dated when compared to today's game choices.

The fixed starting locations have been analyzed to death and some players have a definite disadvantage.  If this game was released today, it probably wouldn't get past it's first print run.

I enjoy the game as long as I don't have to play face-to-face... it's best savoured via long play over phone or email.

the classic...what can I say
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a long game but brilliant. There is no luck involved at all and once you learn how to submit your orders then the game blossoms. It becomes a game of trying to predict others movements... find a balance between advancing and holding a defensive position. There's nothing better than holding a defensive position and stopping some one cold in there tracks..... But nothing worse than holding when nobody tries to attack you and you could have advanced.
Add the this the ability to support other people's troups and have their armies support you, and you end up with fragile alliances that could fall at a moments notice. You need friends to grow but grow to big and your friends will turn against you. 
Remember this is just a game and it will be fun.... very cutthroat.

Really want the old AH version.  Needing seven players can be a drag, and woe to the guy who gets Italy.  Best played over cheese, sausage, and beer.

Anyways, the goal of diplomacy is to be the first nation to control 18 supply centers.  To do this, you must, through sheer force of numbers (two pieces > one piece; three pieces > two).  And to do THIS you must negotiate, intimidate, threaten, backstab, double- and triple-cross your opponents.  No dice in this game.

Fun game with the right number of players. Lots of strategy with nothing left to chance(no rolling dice).  Can be a bit overwhelming with too many. The best number of players in my opinion is 4-5. Don't play this if you're easily offended or are playing against people that you want to remain friends with, as players get eliminated thru broken promises and back stabbing

There is a steep learning curve to this game. You need to know the rules to be able to play the game but the rules are difficult. However, like learning to ride a bike, once you know the rules you're unlikely to forget them.

It is a brilliant game which requires a high level of strategy and a high level of diplomatic skill.

The major drawback is the length that a game takes, which is why I tend to play the game online with 2-3 days between phases. 

Very good web based implementation found at, http://www.playdiplomacy.com/

The classic Diplomacy session for me is the one where my friend Jason and I had an agreement involving spheres of influence, and Norway. Since he was taking his time getting there, I went ahead and grabbed it after a few turns - upsetting him greatly.
A week or so later, as we played allied fleets in a multi-player game of Wooden Ships & Iron Men, he abruptly emptied all of his broadsides into my fleet, while screaming "NORWAY!" at me.

Diplomacy is pretty much the embodient of everything I hate in games: long, overwrought, lies, backstabbing, and king making. After hours of this deceit-filled craziness, somebody must finally give up, ally with another, and end the sordid affair.

I played it so I can say I did but won't ever do it again.

In my lone session, the host of the game refused to let anyone (half were first timers) change their moves after making illegal ones. I suggested the teacher emphasize the spirit of the game; they suggested the rules were the spirit and that players should be punished for violating them. Wow. We called the game 5 hours later still 3 VPs away from victory, as people became too exhausted and annoyed to continue.

RATING: 6
I have never played and don't have a great desire to do so. I have read through the rules. You move to new areas to take control of supply centers. Support helps break ties. After some negotiation, the moves are written down and resolved simultaneously. Much of the game is the negotiating. Games sound a bit long for my taste, but the length can be shortened. If negotiating is going to have a big impact I would rather play something shorter like Werewolf.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A classic game of almost pure negotiation, and honing of those "soft skills" which are rarely targeted by games.  Downsides is you need 7 players, it takes a long time to play (with player elimination a real possibility), and those players need to all have the "right attitude" (i.e. back-stabbing is all in the name of fun, and don't take it personally).

Back to nostalgia lane. There was a time in the early 2000's when I played Diplomacy at cons. I participated in German and European championships with the highlight being 3rd at the German championship 2005. I haven't played a single game since then but I still admire Diplomacy for being so far ahead of its time and generating enormous strategic depth with only a few rules.

Play this with guys from the Diplomacy scene or leave it. Doesn't work with multiple players new to the game.

Diplomacy was the first game that I played that really sold me on board gaming.  Sure I had played quite a few board games previous to this, but they were mostly of the Sorry variety.  I had also played a significant amount of roleplaying games like board games, but I *knew* that they were meant to be played differently, I just hadn't figured out how yet.

But Diplomacy really opened up to me how a good board game could envigorate in me a great sense of excitement and provide a fun way for me to socialize with my friends.  While I understand that this game has its flaws overall, its heavy reliance on negotiation and trust really fits my mode of play, and is almost as-perfect as I want.

Diplomacy, classic that it is, is also, in terms of fun or enjoyability, entirely dependent on the personalities of the people playing. A genial group might have a good time, others may not—

—and something that I have found crucial to realize about the game is that it's ability to create tension and stress is strongly correlated to the length of time allowed for negotiation. An online game with 24-hour adjudication periods is intensely stressful, whereas an in-person game with five minutes for negotiation can almost be comical.

Still, for all the cleverness of the map and mechanics, I prefer negotiation games with more compelling mechanics or deeper theme—and that is entirely a personal thing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
A perfect 10. You don't need much to play.. the map, the pieces, and a lot of straight faces and the willingness to backstab your best friend, or your life partner, or even your own mother. This game is vicious and is mostly all about negotiation and backstabbing any allies you have before they backstab you. If you don't enjoy crushing an opponents best laid plans, or even watching it happen, this game isn't for you. But it's worth a try, just don't blame me if your gaming group breaks up afterwards... :D

Diplomacy is a 10.  It's a 10 because I want it to be.  I don't know if I would enjoy it as much now - I'd probably say it was too long for what it is.  But it was the game that opened up board gaming to me, so to it I will be forever grateful.

Negotiation and simultaneous movement really made this game what it is to me.

You can't fault Diplomacy on its mechanics. It has an excellent mix of deceptively simple rules which play out in complex ways, and cut-throat negotiation which makes no two games alike.

I have had friends storm out of the house furious after being screwed over.  There is a reason this game is nicknamed, "friendbuster."  heh  A speech is definitely necessary before play to explain that this is just a game and to not take anything personally!  The speech didn't always work, though.  heh

I own a copy of this, but have never played it FtF.  I have spent countless hours playing PBEM, and it is simply the most nerve-wracking, intense game I've played.  I've also never won, although I came close once as Russia.  I had about 13 centers, and made a stab move that gained me 4 of the 5 I needed.  The last I failed to take because of an incorrect order, so I had to settle for a draw.

Ugh, talk about a punch in the gut.  This game is totally broken if real alliances get formed.  We had two gamers who wanted to win together and basically would not attack each other.  The idea of the game is subverted in this instance.  But I can't deny the brilliance of the game design, even if I'm sure I won't play that often due to the length, even with timed turns.

A landmark negotiation game, but limited by an unbalanced map and the need for seven players. Further limited by the 4+ hours needed to complete a game. If you can't distance yourself from the game, and not take it personally, you shouldn't be playing. These days I prefer the 1900 variant map. Here is my interpretation it [image=1647898][/image].

Incredible game, even bigger difference. Strategy and diplomacy drives this game, nothing else, amazing. But, not fun to be in the middle (Austria, Germany, Italy!) and is hard to tie people down for a full game of this. Takes a long time to play.

This is a great game! I love the fact that every unit has the same damage weight. This game does a great job of global domination with alliances and breaking alliances. Though this game takes a long long time to play, on average 7is hours, it is worth the play time! Unlike risk which relies on huge die, luck rolling diplomacy relies on the use of allies, and the hope that they stick with you until the end! Great game would recommend to anyone anytime! My favourite global domination game ever so far!

At this point in my life, there are other games that I'd rather play but Diplomacy was once one of my very favorite games.  The simple movement and supply mechanics (no stacking, no recordkeeping, no factors) complement perfectly the real point of the game: free-wheeling negotiation and scheming.  Some people are put off by the malevolent duplicity necessary to play this game.  Personally, I love the tingling of anticipation and fear as "stabs" are being plotted.  Not all of the countries are equally likely to win, but they all have their own personality and can be fun to play.  The game can last a LONG time and sometimes bogs down or becomes stalemated with sustained best play.  In face-to-face play, the winner is often the player who can establish an early lead and then simply outlast the stamina of the others.  For these reasons, the game is better suited to PbEM in many ways.

This game may not be what you expect. Infamous for breaking relationships and causing treachery-induced trauma, this game can also be a very complex dance of strategic thinkery along with the mind-games that come with the extensive interpersonal interactions. Definitely a must-play for any serious gamer, despite its somewhat aging ruleset and unforgiving early game (classic Avalon Hill style).

RATING: 7
It's a solid game. The internet has greatly supplemented this game, since gathering 7 people together for a few hours isn't very plausible.

I feel that many of my losses have occurred in similar ways - Someone who doesn't want to negotiate with me puts me in a bad position to negotiate with other players. Although there is no luck in this game, I admit frustration at seeing my planning, strategy, and negotiation spoiled by other players' poor decisions. I also feel that the attitude many players have about this game is "Because I can stab in this game, I will." 

As a P.S., playing as Italy is truly a drag.

P.S.S. It's difficult to gather 7 players to play, so all of my playing of this game has been online. Some players online just choose to ignore or write single word replies to proposals I make. I'd prefer if they stabbed me in the back and lied to my face. This game is only fun if everyone roleplays to some degree.

This classic game of pure negotiation. Players represent one of the seven "Great Powers of Europe" (Great Britain, France, Austria, Germany, Italy, Russia or Turkey) in the years prior to World War I. Players instruct each of their units by writing a set of "orders." The outcome of each turn is determined by the rules of the game. There are no dice rolls or other elements of chance. With its incredibly simplistic movement mechanics fused to a significant negotiation element, this system is highly respected by many a gamer.

I played extensively during my high school years, and I almost always lost. But this is a gem among games. A pity that it needs 7 players to really shine, which can be a tad difficult to arrange. It is worth noting that many players think that you must stab your adversaries every chance you get, when in fact truth and long-term alliances are as useful as lies and stabs --- and much more easy to pull off.

One of the classic games of all time:  easy to learn, easy to play, hard to master, and impossible to win.  Yes, all the rumors are true:  this game WILL descend, and rapidly, into backstabbing, rancor, ill will, and even destroyed friendships.  It's also as fun as hell and something I wish I could play more often (a problem, insofar as you generally need seven players).

The design is pretty timeless; it's not that much to look at, unless you have some fancy edition, but it's not the looks that makes Diplomacy appealing; it's the winner-take-all fiendishness of the play.  It will bum you out if you let it, but if you're in the mood for some pure cutthroat winner-take-all strategy, there's nothing better.

I've only played Diplomacy a few times, and have found it best as a play by email game (which generally takes about 3 months).  7 players is the only way to go.

This is the Kaiser of Play By Mail games. It of course works to play face-2-face but it can be hard to get enough players. Also, this is a game where it is important who you play with; not everyone is capable of playing this game and face the consequences of your actions...
I did run a PBM fanzine (Lepanto 4-ever) and Diplomacy was always number one in it.
There is an (international) hobby with World and European championship that does attract a lot of good players.
Maybe I should have ranked it 10, but I am not sure I can stand the frustration that you can feel sometimes.... But I do regard this as a game that really should be top 10.

A very nice game with a brilliantly simple design. It's very straightforward: you can move, support, build or convoy or hold. All moves are done simultaneously. That's it and that is the beauty of the game. Diplomacy is definitely key in the game. The only problem is the length of the game; we could've fitted in many other games which are equally enjoyable. Second is the tension level is so high, that you either love it or hate it. I was engrossed in the competitiveness of the game but my partner wasn't used to such high level tension for such a long period of time. This game practically screams at you to backstab someone, and it is something that is bound to happen sooner or later, especially when the timing is just perfect. Regardless, it's a game I will never suggest due to it's length, but will always be happy to play again.

A fantastic party game.  A "pure" strategy game, no luck involved.  The pieces/board are the least important part of the game, as most of it is played in various rooms of the house.  Almost never get to play it however, as the major downsides are numbers of players needed (need at least 6, but really should have 8), and of course, playtime.  I don't think I've actually ever finished a game.

It's a shame that this game takes so long to play because I think it is really intersting. Unfortunately for the game to really acquire its full majesty, you need the full complement of seven players and several hours (if not days) to complete.

It was great when I was in the Navy and we would do a campaign or two each time we deployed. We taped the board behind Plexiglas on teh back of one of the RC panels and did one turn every 24-hours.

Known as a "classic".  Lauded for its simultaneous movement, and its emphasis on player negotiations over game mechanics.  Unfortunately long to complete.  Some are disappointed about its requiring a player to ultimately betray his ally/allies to win the game; but many have enjoyed this aspect the most.  Legend has it that President Kennedy played it with his staff--a chilling thought.  Inventory 2007-09-15

A classic Avalon Hill game.  I have played it mostly over the judge online.  It is a tremendous amount of fun; however, it is not a good game for folks who are easily angered by lying or treachery.  Treachery is the key to the game and you have to revel in being the victim as well as the stabber.  Also you need 7 for this game and it takes at least 4 hours and as many as 8 hours to play.  Ideally, with a face to face game, you need to include an 8th as a gamemaster to keep this moving and reconcile moves. 

I love the game, but almost never get to play.

I really don't like Diplomacy.  I'm not sure that I like diplomacy.  What I really don't like is the forced backstabbing and all the away-from-table-talk.  I'd much prefer a straight-up in-your-face game of conflict.  I'll acknowledge that there could be a good game here, but it amounts more to an activity, rather than a game.  And if it's a lying contest you want, just play Werewolf.

AWESOME! I found this at an antique store where I live for 6.50! It was one of the most exciting shopping moments I've ever had. The copy I found is in near mint condition, a little fading on the box was the only real damage. The coolest part of the whole thing is that the tagboard control tokens were still unused on a single perforated sheet as well as the player cheat sheet maps were still stuck together with none missing. It's obviously been opened before and possibly considered a play or two, but hasn't been played yet. It was like Christmas!

RATING: 8
Diplomacy is a classic and deserves to be considered as such.  The secret orders and lack of random elements give it a unique feel in the realm of map & territory strategy games.  I think it's the gold standard for great power strategy games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
I consider Diplomacy to be the purest, most elegant, and most ruthlessly efficient - or is that efficiently ruthless? - board game of all time. If Texas Hold'em is the Cadillac of card games, then Diplomacy is the Bentley of board games. Your success is solely in your hands, without the worry of getting "screwed by the dice" or otherwise crushed by chance.

If you are willing to betray your closest friend or significant other, if you are able to lie with a smile on your face and then sleep well that night, then Diplomacy is the game for you.

Cann recommends it.

Games can last a VERY long time (6 hours) and practically speaking, you need 5 players at a minimum to make the game worthwhile fun.

Might be worth getting, but definitely not something to rush into as it likely won't hit the table too often.

50th anniversary edition apparently doesn't look too nice. Avalon Hill/Hasbro version is apparently a lot nicer.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Lovely finish on the deluxe edition with satisfying metal pieces, and all strategy no luck (in the conventional sense at least - though you can still be 'lucky' with other players' decisions). On the downside it is a long long game, and by far the best to play with a full complement of players. Interestingly Turkey has had the edge in the 2 or 3 games I've played, particularly when seizing the Black Sea early on, whilst Austria-Hungary and Italy seemed the most difficult to play. I can admire the game, but would question how much fun it is despite winning twice. Quite possibly we just don't have quite the right blend in our regular group for this, as it is difficult to get 7 keen and evenly matched players together.

Perfect pure strategy & diplomacy game
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Among the greatest games ever produced.  This is not strictly a boardgame, it is more a game of competitive personal interaction.  It requires the abilities to nurture trust and cooperation, to deceive, lie, beg, cajole, to create and decipher intrigues, and to weigh risk and capitalize on opportunities when they appear, often by a vicious stab of your erstwhile ally.  (This is not for everyone!)  And, despite the relatively simple game mechanics, it demands a great deal of tactical prowess to succeed.

For a few short years, I practically lived and breathed Diplomacy, especially playing postally.  It's been 15 years or so since I've played in a face-to-face game and I'll almost certainly never do so again.

A wargame with no random element. 
The idea (simple rules, a lot of negotiation, simultaneous orders, no luck: the given orders determine what happens) is great. 
Unfortunately it needs seven players to be at best (and at least five to be interesting), is VERY long, has player elimination and possible "vengeance" from previous games (plus it puts many of the players in a "bad mood" as treachery and betrayal are keys to victory).

Played a lot in college. [-]I'd play again in a heartbeat if I could get 6 other thick-skinned people together for several hours.[/-] [Who am I kidding? The opportunity cost of playing this instead of a few other great shorter games is a tough sell. Diplomacy is worthy of praise, but it's almost a lifestyle game.]

Play by e-mail with automatic adjudication and regular deadlines (like a day or two per move) is pretty good, too.

Best with experienced players.  One of those games simple to learn yet not so easy to play to victory all the time.  You need good people skills for this game – must be able to convince others to do you a favor as ally or bidding as you duped minion.  I won Best Germany in one convention that France allied with me.  I lost quickly as Italy in game I thought I could trust Austria in.  Life goes on.

I have played in tournaments at gaming convention – it has the advantage of no consequences for backstabbing later on (complete stranger easier to deceive then guy who drove you to convention and who just might leave with out you).  PBEM is okay but it tends to have high dropout rate.  Best when turns are a few days apart (if not weekly) so the hashing of deals and conspiracies go the full course.

If you play with newbies try to help them out.  Don’t just dogpile on them with your buddies and turn them off to a good game.  Good Dip players take time to develop – need to build up the calluses on the old ego.

Played seven player - I was Germany.  Early deals with England and France kept me safe but boxed it.  I encouraged England to overextend against Russia through Norway, then assisted France in taking the British Isles.  For my troubles, I took Belgium from France... that didn't go over well.  It only lasted two turns.  I couldn't make headway toward Italy, and saw moving east as my only option.  I also saw an opening on the British Isle, once France began to move it's 6 (!) fleets south against the growing Turkish threat.  We called the game when France (Paul), Turkey (Jay) and I were the only countries with any force remaining.  Although I was in third at the time, I think I could have forged a deal with Turkey and limited France's advance on the continent because of his lack of armies.  It would have been interesting, but long!  We got to this point in about 2.5 hours, but stick to strict 5 minute diplomacy phases, even with 5 new players (and I'd only played once in my youth).

Wonderful game of politics, great to ruin longtime friendships (he, he). Not for everybody, though. Usually, you will need one strong, unbreakable alliance to have a chance.

An Epic battle of wits and negotiation.  I;m sure you have heard it before, but only the best of people can play this.  Everygame is a new challenge, tactically, strategically, and mentally.      If I play this with a friend and he is angry at me because of the games outcome than he wasn;t a good friend to begin with.  The only thing wrong is that it needs 7 of the right people; conceptually it's one of the best games ever made.

RATING: 10
This cross between a wargame and a negotiation game is the best in its genre, by far.

In order to win this game, you have to do well  in both war games and negotiation games. You need to be clever in manouvering the few pieces you own in order to make even a small gain. But, far more important, you need get other players to move THEIR pieces so that they help YOU to win the game!

The game can be played by mail, but is best played face-to-face. This way, a game can easily take eight hours and still feel like a fast-paced game, without a single minute of 'down-time'! It is a turmoil of little chats, strategic discussions, and tactical plotting. You have to try to influence the other players in doing the right things, while constantly be aware that players may not tell the truth and are scheming to backstab you. And finally, you have to complete your complex orders under the pressure of the clock.

I really appreciated this game when I was younger, but I don't ever see myself playing it again.

Firstly, playing less than the full 7 players is so much less satisfying, and finding 7 people happy to spend an entire day on a game can be extremely difficult.

Secondly, not only does it take over six hours, but the game will usually be effectively over for two or three of players within the first hour and a half.

Thirdly, it can take a long time before players no longer with a chance of winning are eliminated, and these players have usually lost a lot of interest, their actions affecting the outcome for other players but not themselves.

Also, there is significant mismatch between starting countries.  Players usually have preferences, but Austria, Germany and Italy have significantly lower win rates.

This is a great game, and the skill of how you interact with other players is brilliant, together with weighing up your strategic position.  I now enjoy playing games for more than just those reasons however, and prefer games where everyone can enjoy some time together.  People might be sick of hearing the words "victory point", but it does solve the problem of player elimination, and keeps games to a length where serious gamers, and not so serious gamers can enjoy it.

Diplomacy is a wonderful game full of negoation and backstabbing. My main gripe though is that it is very hard to find enough players to make this game fun. 5 to 7 players is about the right niche and any less the game becomes dull.

Quite fun, but quite long.  With the possible exception of Gunboat, there is no such thing as a quick game of Diplomacy.  Also requires maturity amongst the players since betrayal is part of the game.

The game has players take on the roles of the great powers leading up to WWI. By forming teams you carve up Europe, trying to get the most supply centers. But in order to win, you will have to betray allies.

RATING: 10
The extreme difficulty in getting 7 folks to commit to playing Diplomacy (and the even GREATER extreme difficulty in getting one of those 7 to commit to playing as hopeless Austria!) only INFLATES the extreme satisfaction when this rare confluence of individuals actually occurs.

Despite all it's ugly points and hectoring opponents, I still say this is my #1 favorite strategy game. All time. Period. There's just nothing like it. The discussions behind closed doors mechanic is simply phenomenal, and FAR beyond it's time.

Straight up player negotiation and interaction. This game makes you feel like you're conspiring with others to crush your enemies and take over the world. however the gameplay can overstay its welcome, but that seems to be the case with all of these type games, cosmic encounter, etc.

RATING: 6
Utterly compelling. Shame about the play time. I've become convinced that PBEM offers other advantages than just solving the time problem - you can't be overseen chatting to your enemies enemy and it actually feels morel like a game of 1900's diplomatic communication when you can't see the people you're playing against.

I guess (though didnt know it at time), my first proper game.  Friendships were broken over whole day/whole weekend sessions.  And my iron will and slick influncing skills meant I ALWAYS WON (except when cursed with Austro-Hungary...).  I wish I had the time and friends necessary to accommodate a few more plays of this beast of an experience.  But I fear this is a game for teenage years, not when you are grateful to grab 2hrs max for a quick gaming fix every now and then...  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
A highly imbalanced game in regards to player count. The game itself is long (actually recommended to play it online) but no matter what you do, there inevitably will be one or several players that will get kicked out of the game early on. So gameplay would be: 7 people meeting to play this game for whole day but in 1 hour 1-3 players get eliminated and have nothing else to do - maybe play some other game or just go home. Your game is over. If you want a modern version of this game with far more balance in regards of this player loss issue, then play Game of Thrones - it is obviously based on diplomacy but greatly modified to cover all the issues, amount of diplomacy itself slightly reduced (but still necessary) and game time itself shortened 1.5-2 times. This is a very old game and it probably was very good back in the days. Not recommended.

RATING: 2
Sometimes I find the rating system on BGG a little wonky.  Giving Diplomacy a 2 seems harsh.  However, based on what a 2 in BGGs rating system means, it's the closest to how I feel about the game.

Diplomacy is a war/negotiation game set in the years leading up to WWI.  The 7 major European countries are represented on the board, which is in fact a map of Europe.  To win, a player has to control 18 specially marked provinces on the board.  Every country starts with three of these provinces, except Russia, which starts with four.  In order for anyone to do well at all they are going to have to form alliances with other players.  However, these alliances are fragile at best as players never know how much to trust each other, and are always looking for an opportunity to turn on their allies when it's most advantageous.

Diplomacy is an incredibly well thought out game.  All countries have more-or-less even strength to start, and are immediately threatened by at least two other neighbouring countries.  I really appreciate and applaud the game for its design.

I hate long games.  I just don't want to invest hours upon hours of time to one game.  Despite this I really wanted to try Diplomacy, which has a reputation of going long.  Now I've played it, and my desire to play has been quenched - forever.  This is why I rate Diplomacy a 2.  It's because a 2 indicates that I never want to play the game again.  For one thing, the game had gone seven hours before the first (and as it turned out only) player was eliminated.  A big reason for the length is that you can only go so far before getting bogged down in stand-offs with other countries'  military units.  These impasses are frequent, and slow progress down considerably.  Second, you have to lie to other players and stab them in the back.  This is known about the game, and my group even discussed it before we started.  We reminded ourselves that it's only a game, so don't get too upset when someone turns on you.  However, when I stabbed my friend in the back, who thought we had a rock-solid alliance, he was angry.  I didn't like making him feel that way.  I also didn't like betraying his trust in me, even though it was only within the game.  I've realized that if a game causes negative emotions I'm just not into it.  I sold my copy of Intrigue after one play for this same reason.

So, I doubt I'll ever play Diplomacy again.  For the reasons mentioned I can't recommend the game either.

The players make this a great game.  The combat system is overly simplistic, but along with the geography of the board there is a certain strange elegance.

This game is not a game of backstabbing as much as it is a game of subtle coercion and quick wits.

I love the idea of secret conferences, but hate that your odds of winning/losing are overwhelmingly increased if the other players favor/don't-favor you personally. There should be much more "game" reason for winning or losing, especially in a game this long.

Also: the fun of stalemates, joint-victories, non-binding negotations, arbitrary ally selection, player elimination, and 1 or 2 players almost always get beat down early and have a long boring game ahead of themselves.

Should be called "International Politics for Boring Assholes". Move generic units. Make unenforceable treaty. Break treaty. Attack former friend who was former enemy who was former friend. Get attacked by former friend who was former enemy who was blah blah blah blah. It might appeal to certain people who find the United Nations general assembly fascinating, but I do not want, even for one minute, to hang out with people like that. I'd like to state the following for the record: If you lost (or could lose) a friend because of this game, you are a blithering idiot. What kind of wanker would break a friendship over any game, let alone one this excruciatingly dull? With its moronic all-units-are-identical setup, the endless negotiations and a so-dumb-I-can't-believe-it's-not-a-joke combat system, a session of Diplomacy rivals C-Span for tediousness and dental surgery for unpleasantness. Scheming and wanking, scheming and wanking. I'd rather be stretched thin, twisted into a meat pretzel and shoved up a donkey's bunghole.

Need the right group of people.  Used to like this one more, but too many stalemates relegated this to the dusty shelf.  A pity, but at least i have the memories of the great games of the deep past to look back upon: some of my best gaming memories came from this one, so it does not get traded.  Machiavelli fixed some of the problems, and I would play the latter game again.

I really like the interaction between players in this game.  I also like the feel of a war game without the typical battles that must take place.  It can be a bit brutal, but I think that adds to the enjoyment.

Definitely not my cup of tea -- overly long, lots of negotiation/whining/backstabbing, and lots of downtime while players write their orders. Players can be shut out of victory fairly early, which can make for an even longer game :)

I don't like negotiation games but this one is very impressive as it's pure negotiation and it was created in the late '50s.  It's perfect for what it is... so I give it respect but don't really like it too much.  I enjoyed the angst involved in wondering if your allies were going to stab you.  Trying to plan how to get ahead of the pact without being too dangerous (and ganged up on).  Basically it's a game where if the other players don't want you to win, you won't.  I know I could get some flak for saying this but my ideal game of Diplomacy would be 5 minute turns and no talking inbetween.  I enjoyed it's simple tactical aspects and the simultaneous action selection.

RATING: 10
This is hands down the best game I have ever played. Unfortunately, it comes with a huge caveat: you need to play with the right people. Playing with people who are oversensitive is simply a recipe for disaster, and you need to recognize this going in if the game is going to be any fun at all.

This isn't a game you can just take off the shelf and play at a game night - plan in advance, gather your six least sensitive friends, and spend the entire day. It will be worth it.

The rules are simple and the strategy deep, but it is the negotiation that truly makes this game shine.

At first it seems like a GREAT game. But!... when you play it too much the diplomacy goes away. People can't be fooled anymore and it's not the same fun. Go play "Empires in Arms" if you want to get the diplomacy back.

RATING: 9
Absolutely love this game.  I can play it with friends, and with strangers, but usually not with a mix.  The chief reason for this being: I love the balance of this game.  The large push to escape the "random chance" element that is always so prevalent in board and card games.  Instead, there is a heavy reliance on your own social skills, strategic wisdom, and even your overall willpower.  However, when there is a combination of strangers and close friends in a single game, I feel like it unbalances the diplomatic element.  Some people know others well already, and so there are all ready unbalanced relations set up in advance.  But maybe that mirrors real-life diplomacy.  I'm probably just bitter from always being betrayed my closest friends in this game haha.  Definitely a favorite though.  It would be a 10, if it weren't for the replay value.  After 10 or so games with the same people, they start to replicate past games.  Needs a changing crowd.  But love it nonetheless.

This game is amazing, the rules are perfect I have never been in a situation not described in the rule book. The gameplay is so much fun: negociations, treasons, taunts, bribes, lies, everything that makes us human is in this game!
2 problems: play with french rules. With original rules the game losses any interest when one player becomes strong as he has no more reason to negociate and just destroy everybody. With french rules the time limit forces the big guys to spare the little ones who can help the opponents to get the one center that will cost the victory.
And on internet people tend to play several games in parallel so they don't have time to negociate and games tend to be boring.

My favorite game. Usually I'm more of an elegant Euro-player, but, Diplomacy is something beyond war/euro game. Diplomacy is a game of its own. So clever, so engaging, so elegant, strategic, intense, deep. Its a divine game, an inch from being the perfect game. It provides hours and hours of whispering discussions, writing notes, carefully planning moves. If only there was a way to rank a game 11.

I studied the map so much when I was young that my European geography is permanently stuck at 1900. Most games end in a stalemate draw of some combination of the starting players - which makes a solo victory all the sweeter. A game that lends itself well (better?) to PBEM.

One of the great multiplayer wargames with simple rules.
Played about 30 times in the 80's.
Powerfull theme, good mecanics, simple rules, full interaction (wargame w diplomacy). But a bit too long (4-6h) for so many players needed for a good game (6 or 7pl). Players must be chosen carefully, also. Players' maturity is important. Played with people from about 15 different countries. It seems some cultures deal better with tense relationships than others, but this is another story.
Underated. 6 or 7 players: Both games are equally good since alliances can be balanced. 5 or 4 players can be playable also but it loses some of the richness of negociation.
Does not get a 10 because of the conflictuality of it. Players must be great friends... or total strangers. And be aware that backstabbing is inevitable...

My only pure ten, and this game is so superb, "it goes up to eleven." If I have the number of people (and for me that even includes six or five with a variant board), I will always suggest it first, and I will always chose it over another game. Why? Of all the boardgames I've played, this is the one that had the most profound psychological impact on me while playing, the one that challenges me the most intellectually, the one I learn the most from playing - both about strategy, about other human beings, and about myself. And because it is the only game that I've ever played where the metagame is drawn so far into the forefront of the action, it actually feels paradoxically HONEST to play it (that is to say - since ALL games have this metagame layer - Diplomacy is the only one that acknowledges and incorporates this layer as honestly and directly into the play itself, so that to play it correctly is to play the metagame as much as the game. Most games require players to deny the metagame, but it's always there, just below the surface of the actions, affecting our choices and perceptions. At least in a game of Dip, I know players are going to try to manipulate me and each other openly. To me that honesty is a kind of relief.)

To be a master of games, a worthy opponent, an ubermensch of strategy, is to acknowledge there is no game free of metagame, and that ultimately all games involve negotiation, even if that negotiation is nonverbal/unspoken. Mastery of Diplomacy, of it's elements of deception, politicking, manipulation, and backstabbing, and even more importantly, mastering all of the above happening TO YOU, and still being able to walk away with a smile, realizing that is IS all just a game, are essential elements for mastery of all other games. Hell I'll go a step farther and say mastery of these things is necessary to live life happily and well. 

Or if you dislike my hyperbolic rhetoric, let me put it another way. To borrow from clearclaw, Diplomacy, for me, more so than any other game, seems to highlight "the intersection of the mechanically deterministic aspects of games with human ambiguity."

RATING: 4
BREAKDOWN OF SCORE:

Cleverness and game mechanics of the game: 9
Length of game, combined with the horrible sickness-to-stomach feeling that I feel throughout EVERY moment of EVERY time i've played this: 1

Average: 5

I'm just don't have the fortitude to endure this game, although the diceless and cooperative-while-simultaneously-backstabbing element of the game is very unique and clever.  Also another complaint:  the cooperative win condition of the game enabled me to win my first game (played during my junior year of high school, on the only day of classes i ever skipped) when I, playing as England, realized that between myself and Russia (whom I'd never interacted with or cooperated with for the whole game) could win the game simply by declaring an alliance, because between us we had enough regions to win.  A very lackluster finish.  (but of course, I couldn't avoid the opportunity to win it as soon as possible, given how sick I felt at backstabbing by best friend as Germany).

A final note: I've seen so many people get so upset at people lying to them, that the bad feeling has persisted beyond the game.  I know that lying/deception is a part of many games that I really enjoy (e.g. poker), but I guess the directness and the extent to which you must lie and betray an ally in this game for the ploy to be successful makes the consequences a little more severe.    This is the one game I think would be much better to play with strangers than with friends.  (although, on second thought, Poker too might often be better played with strangers)...
For this final issue, another point is deducted from that 5.

It's a good way to learn that games are not life and death; if you can survive (emotionally) the trauma of a good backstabbing (or even a bitter, useless one) and come back to fight another day, you'll be a better person for it.

This is a deceptive game; it's easy to play, and it's fairly easy to get people to play online, and it's a game without any random element whatsoever.  Sounds like fun, eh?  Well, it usually is, but it suffers from one big drawback:  from my experience, the sort of people who tend to win the game the most often are the people that you'd ordinarily not want to hang around with.  No offense to people who win often and can distinguish between the game and real life, but some of the people I've played with tend to take the same approach to real life as they do Diplomacy, and for me that tends to lessen the fun of the game a bit.

Nevertheless, as long as you can play with people who realise it's just a game then this is a superb strategy which has no reliance on luck aside from the initial drawing of countries.

I like negotiation games, and Diplomacy is the origin of many.  It has wonderful game mechanics.  There are flaws which stop me from playing it though.  It is really long.  It has the same setup every time.  And, the worst flaw of all is that the game gives you no reason to attack one person over the other.  Your first victim is entirely random, which makes playing for another 5 hours afterwords feel useless.

One of the best games around proving simple usually is best!  :-)  Unfortunately game is slightly imbalanced and a couple of the nations (Italy & Austria-Hungary) are very hard to keep in the game in a prolonged competitive session, while Turkey seems to have a far too easy road most of the time...

Diplomacy is a great game, but I'll never play it again.  Played with my long-time friends, the outcome is predictable from having played too many games together.  And the game is too evil to play with people I don't know- this game should only be played by people who will always try to win for themselves (i.e., not just do things to hurt others) and who don't hold a grudge for things that happen in the game.

Diplomacy sounds really cool when people tell you about it. It has some problems though... you have to get 7 people together for a decent game. And a game can last a full day. 

And the Austria player, if he or she isn't really good, can be eliminated about an hour into the game. This game also has a long history of destroying friendships due to frequent backstabbing and frustration, so be careful with whom you play. (strangers are best).

I still like the concept of the game and occasionally play it online. I think that's where the game works best. There's been some attempts to modernize the idea of Diplomacy (Game of Thrones, the Boardgame).

My lifesblood, unfortunately...

I prefer this over PBEM unless you've really got the right group and the right time limits.  It does tire one out and I always need a significant break from Dip games, unless we're changing to one of the variants.  Then I'm ready to go...

What I can't understand for the life of me are all the BGGers who hate this game so.  They play negotiation games, aggressive war games, and GoT (Dip's weaker cousin) with abandon, but somehow only Diplomacy makes you mean and nasty.  I've played many a Dip game without lying or breaking an agreement.  The game didn't lose you friends, folks, YOU lost your friends!  The game may not be for you, but take some responsibility!

RATING: 3.5
I respect the elegance and purity of this game. However, its probably the most personality-sensitive game ever made so it can either go very well (rarely) or (commonly) can piss of friends and people you've only just met. And this is my biggest problem with Diplomacy - its more metagame than game. If you try to play with people who you don't know so well and they're all friends then you're just going to lose no matter what. Furthermore, it gets boring with repeated plays inside the same group. Finally, it goes on far too long, especially for those players who are eliminated early and have to play a filler while they wait for the main game to end (or deadlock). I definitely won't play this again unless by PBEM.

I like this game a lot!  The mechanics are simple and the politics of playing are fun.  The downside is finding seven players to play.  I recommend playing by email, which is what I do.  The only reason I rate it a 9 and not a 10 is that I would not play it with everyone I know, but I will never turn down a game.

Lots of rules. Orders are written down on crowded pads. These get cluttered and make it hard to decipher. Not particularly worried about cheating from that aspect, but when you have a large army, it's hard to remember what you were moving where.

I won the first ever game of this that I played, then suffered a mauling during several play-by-mail games and haven't played it since (and that was a couple of decades ago!)

RATING: 6
The 'granddaddy' of negotiation games, Diplomacy is often touted as a pure gaming experience due to the fact that no dice or cards are used in any way. For me it is a little dry and the play is highly dependant on the personalities involved and how they respond to one another. I find too many people bring personal baggage into the game that results in vendettas and generally ruins the experience.

Can be a good game though if the players can play the game for what it is and treat each new game as a new experience - leaving their 'hang-ups' at the door.

I got a really nice copy of this at Goodwill, so I thought I'd try it out. Turns out that Diplomacy is incredibly outdated and unnecessarily long. I don't see how people still want to play this when there are other games that do the same thing, only better. The fact that the game recommends you take 15 minutes between each turn to go off with other people to make deals and/or eavesdrop on them is ridiculous. This feels like the precursor to a reality show or something. Not to mention that the decisions in the game are pretty basic. I like that you can do more than just move units around, a la Risk, but why does this need to be such a long game? This might be fun with the right group under the right circumstances, but this really isn't a game for me.

Would rather play Clockwork Wars.

Way too long for an elimination game! Even worst though is getting only 'mostly' taken out and then having to actually sit through hours of "gameplay" you can't actually contribute to.

The king of strategy games where negotiation skills is everything and chance plays no part. In my best games, I have managed to balance the other powers while growing slowly and waiting for the right moment to stab. However, it is also in Diplomacy's nature that not all players participate to the end so for game nights alternative games are needed. 

Pros: Simple rules, chance plays no part, secret negotiations and movements adds excitement, possibility to come back after bad start (and fail in spite of good start)
Cons: Long game sessions, needs seven engaged players for best games, not all players participate to the end

RATING: 5
The game works (there's nothing dysfunctional about it) although it was really designed for maximal player count: both the talking and the simultaneous resolution of 20+ orders make each turn last very, very long and player elimination must be taken in count so that players have a plan B once they're out of the game. It's just unlikely that I'll ever get 7 suitable players committing to the prospect of that game for 7-12 hours (possibly less for a few of them), relegating Diplomacy to the realm of play-by-mail computer games. I also emit some doubts concerning the balance of the map.

You might wonder what kind of prejudiced snob I am for talking about "suitable players". Well, let's just say that on top of the "must like negotiation/wargames" filter, there is this subset of people who have a hard  time separating the gaming space from the rest of their life and tend to take things quite personally. Diplomacy is longer than any film you've probably seen and is all player-driven narrative, no filler. You will grow to care about that nation you've been impersonating for the last 4 hours and there will be betrayal at crucial points. If you can't handle the thought of your best friend or your significant other casually blowing up what you've been building with care for god knows how long or have demonstrated anything close to being a sore loser, I would highly recommend you stay as far away from Diplomacy as you can.

Hours of real-time negotiation merged with simple yet deep troop movement decisions.  The only thing keeping it this low is requiring 7 players and having some balance issues.  The former is probably the larger problem.  The latter is easily solved by negotiation in the game.

This is the best game made before the 1990s, at least, of this type.  Right now the only game I have above it before the 2000s is Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective, and that's still 22 years after.  I wish this game beat out Risk in popularity.

There's no experience quite like this, when you actually get the 7 people together. It's pure gaming bliss. I've played quite a few games of this with a particular group, and we always have a blast, but perhaps it's also of note that we rarely actually finish the game... 

UPDATE: I just docked A Game of Thrones a point for being unbalanced, and so I feel obliged to bring Diplomacy from a 9 to an 8 for the same reason. We've never had an Italy, Turkey, or England win, and only one freak Austria one.

Classic game of negotiation, and simple movement of units before WW I. Played this game many times in high school. Sure it's fun when you are on the winning side of an alliance, and it is not much fun when you are getting backstabbed. I think it had a niche market back in the early 80's, but the game length, and player elimination makes this a less palatable game now.

RATING: 8
I cannot stand liars and cheats; one of the few things that makes me really furious is when I find I've been lied to by someone I thought I could trust. So, all things considered, it's a bit weird that I like Diplomacy, in which all those things I hate are the very core of the game. 

I had a series of games with a group of friends and we really got into it and nobody ended up hating anyone else. I think it's important that we kept up the disconnect between our real selves and our in-game roles; it was always "France, I want to talk to you", rather than "Dave, I want to talk to you". Given the amount of personal interaction involved, I could see how this could easily get messy if people have the wrong attitude to the game and take things personally.

Getting enough players to commit to the time required is a bit difficult, unfortunately, or I'd have played it more.

I really think this game IS amazing, but i can not give it a higher ranking because this game really only depends on whom you can ally with. I KNOW this is all this game is designed to do but it can be very unsatisifiyng when on a game evening after one of seven hours one ore more players are defeated and can go home. This is player elimination extreme.

I really want to enjoy this game but it is hard to get a group of players together to play this game with. I tried it at work (1 order per day) but it was too time consuming for most of them to keep up or stay interested in the game. I have also tried to play in-person but it took too much time for them and most people in my group are not very communicative or cooperative which means I am doing a lot of the heavy lifting, often at my detriment at this game.

RATING: 8
This is a very special game, and I find it difficult to compare it with most of my other games, due to the length of time (months!) over which it is played.  My rating is strictly for a one-turn-per-week PBEM game; I would never consider playing this face-to-face as a boardgame (way too long, yet also too rushed -- very painful!  In that format, I'd probably rate it about 2).  Note that this game is NOT for the faint-hearted; it's all about well-timed, vicious acts of betrayal that may cost you friends (if they can't distinguish the game from reality) so be careful who you play this with! Preferred roles: Germany or Austria-Hungary.

Really excellent game, but intimidating and I suppose impractical, cos it generally takes a long, long time! Requires at least a whole day or possibly several sessions (days) to get through. But then each turn covers six months, so what do you expect?

Really needs seven players to shine, imo. Six players is also good, but it's a case of diminishing returns the fewer players there are. Playing with three will probably lead to murder or divorce, and a two-player game is never-ending and involves very little diplomacy, somewhat defeating the purpose of the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
It's the ultimate game. It breaks down over the stalemate lines, and there IS luck involved depending on what players get placed around you. (If you're surrounded by nations being played by people who came into the game with a prearranged treaty, you're in trouble already.) But the simplicity and depth of strategy is brilliant design.

 The game can also drive you crazy, because it brings out the worst in some people. It's important to play with the right people, otherwise it can be a terrible experience full of childish drama and insults. For good sports only!

An absolute classic game.  It does suffer from the problem that it takes forever to play; I haven't played this face-to-face in many years because of this.  Playing this over the internet or PBM has other advantages too, as it allows more time for diplomacy and hides who is conspiring with who, and you'll often need a lot of time to plan your moves to find the most reliable strategy.  The game does have weaknesses in that it is too easy to set up stalemate lines, and other well-known deficiencies in the map such as Venice and Trieste neighbouring each other.  I'm not sure if I'll play this game much in the future, but it will always be a favourite of mine.

[size=10]Diplomacy was created in 1954 and is arguably the archetype for all negotiation games ever since. There are no dice, and there is only one player unit per occupied territory. At the beginning of a turn, a non-binding negotiation phase allows players to discuss possible movements and support among one another, publicly and/or privately. At the conclusion of the negotiation phase, each player secretly submits their final binding movements via written orders. All player movements are revealed simultaneously and resolved with a simple set of rules for the resulting chain reactions.

[color=#3388cc][b]One cannot be told what it is like to play Diplomacy. You must play it to understand.[/b][/color]

[size=10]Anyone [i]can[/i] play Diplomacy, but not everyone [i]should[/i]...[/size]

[inlineimg]https://cf.geekdo-static.com/images/icons/silkicons/information.png[/inlineimg] You cannot be a sore loser.
[INLINEIMG]https://cf.geekdo-static.com/images/icons/silkicons/information.png[/INLINEIMG] You are likely to lose, and possibly very quickly.
[INLINEIMG]https://cf.geekdo-static.com/images/icons/silkicons/information.png[/INLINEIMG] You might lie to other players.
[INLINEIMG]https://cf.geekdo-static.com/images/icons/silkicons/information.png[/INLINEIMG] Other players might lie to you.
[INLINEIMG]https://cf.geekdo-static.com/images/icons/silkicons/information.png[/INLINEIMG] You might backstab your friends.
[INLINEIMG]https://cf.geekdo-static.com/images/icons/silkicons/information.png[/INLINEIMG] Your friends might backstab you.
[INLINEIMG]https://cf.geekdo-static.com/images/icons/silkicons/information.png[/INLINEIMG] You will have a constant level of paranoia.

[INLINEIMG]https://cf.geekdo-static.com/images/icons/silkicons/delete.png[/INLINEIMG] If you [i]do not[/i] find any of the conditions above to be enjoyable in a game, then you will find Diplomacy to be the worst game you have ever encountered. Worse than Monopoly, Dodge Ball, or Slug Bug Yellow. If you have only heard about Diplomacy, you will give it a BGG rating of 2 to 8 based on your perceptions. If you accidentally play Diplomacy, you will give it a BGG rating of 1 and tell everyone that the game is horrible.

[INLINEIMG]https://cf.geekdo-static.com/images/icons/silkicons/accept.png[/INLINEIMG] If you [i]are okay[/i] with the conditions mentioned above, then you are likely to enjoy the game, and will probably give it a BGG rating of 9 or 10.

It should be emphasized that the negotiation phase is non-binding. Any player may propose any movement or support, and share any information about any other player's proposals. A player's actual orders for the current turn are not final until they have been written and submitted via written orders. Any unit in the game that does not have an order is considered to be "holding" its ground in defense. Invalid orders, which happen more frequently than expected, are discarded. 

There is a constant buildup of suspense throughout a turn, until all of the orders have been submitted and are revealed. When playing in-person, the level of negotiation and paranoia increases dramatically and players retain a great nostalgia for epic plays, years after the fact.

[INLINEIMG]https://cf.geekdo-static.com/images/icons/silkicons/information.png[/INLINEIMG] [color=#3388cc][b]Hardcore/Professional Play:[/b][/color]

With the proper guidance, and even re-themed, I have read of many successful classroom diplomacy games as demonstrations of negotiation, support and concession. We have found that the game works best when players can commit to a slow game with one turn per day or week. A game usually lasts ten to sixteen turns, which can be two weeks or several months, depending on turn frequency. 

There can be, but not required, one neutral participant that acts as Game Master/Judge and accepts all player turn orders via email or by hand. 

All players should have access to an online or printed photo or drawing of the map that shows the current status of owned/occupied territories and all units in play. Players can negotiate any time and any place they desire, as long as they submit their final orders prior to the turn deadline. 

At the appointed time, all players should gather in person or video conference, around the official map board and playing pieces. When the final orders are revealed and resolved, each player can experience the jubilation, dispair, triumph and defeat, and see the emotions on each other's faces as alliances are formed or betrayed.

[color=#3388cc][b]Variations?[/b][/color]

There are multiple map variations for different numbers of players. The Diplomatic Pouch and similar sites have many maps to suit your tastes.

[color=#3388cc][b]Pimp it?[/b][/color]

When playing with more than seven players, you have to create additional playing pieces. I have used FIMO clay to create ships and infantry units. There are  many colors and you can cut simple meeple shapes with an xacto knife and bake the clay to harden it. The clay does not shrink and will maintain its bright colors, unless you overcook them. Or you could acquire multiple sets of Diplomacy and paint extra pieces to meet your color needs.

Trying to rate this game really highlights the flaws in the BGG rating scale. I will very rarely 'feel like' playing this game. And I would likely turn it down unless a number of factors lined up just right. But it is an excellent game. And it deserves better than a 6. So, there you go.

RATING: 10
[2010/01/01] +4 plays before recording


disclaimer: i don't actually "own" this game, but i have a great web server i play it on...
-
in fact i could not imagine playing the board game version again (i played the board game version once, and i like the web version FAR better)
Why?
Diplomacy is a mammoth of a game... the board game version would require too much table space for too long, and I dont think you could ever schedule 7 people not in college/retired to spend all day playing 1 game

In addition the web server adjuncates the moves atomatically; it provides the perfect interface for truly secret diplomatic messages; it allows you to view that games movement history; and it lets you view the history of all the games you've played.

To top all of that off, the web game is far superior for all the players that lose the game early on... (they aren't just stuck there as a non-participant, but they can view all of the remaining moves at thier leisure)
______________

So now that you know why the web version is better than the boardgame version... here is why Diplomacy is the greatest game of all time:

First lets do the book vs movie comparison/analogy... A book typically takes longer than a movie thus allowing you greater time to learn the characters, the plot, and the intricate details. A movie can be good for what it is, but I MUCH more enjoy a good book than a good movie.

Diplomacy is the "book" of boardgames... you will not finish diplomacy in one sitting... every year is it's own chapter, and the feeling of the game can dramatically change at any time

like chess, this game requires prediction of your opponents moves... but unlike chess you start with 6 opponents; you all move at the same time; and you can influce your opponents moves.

The real magic of diplomacy is the unique skill set that you use to win... With chess: its all strategy... with catan and other eurogames: it's a mix of tactics, strategy, and sometimes random-chance... Diplomacy involves NO random chance and it only requires BASIC strategy and tactics to play, but they are both subserviant to the skill of diplomacy... and if you aren't certain what that means, let me describe it as the ability to influence others into a desired course of action. Nothing is sacred, and and any course of action is acceptible: You may lie, mislead, ignore, doublecross, join, backstab, plead, threaten, support, guide, accuse, plagerize, help, cower, or abstain.

In the truist sense you are playing each of your opponents... they are the game, and any information you can gain from them is valuable. the map simply serves as a way to measure your diplomatic success. (but if you are a strategist or a tactitian, it will help to complement and support your diplomatic skills).

The first game I played to completion took a total of 2-3 months (10-60 mins every other day on average). I played against a great gaming friend from home (he is one of the top diplomacy players on the web, with 10 or so active games at a time.) I did not let him know that he was playing against me, and it was such an incredible experience to play against such an talented opponent.

I highly recomend this game to anyone who meets this criteria:
*THICK SKINED (your best friend could crush you)
*RESPONSIBLE (you will need submit orders on a regular basis)
*GAMER (you should have a love for board games, and have a decent level of strategical and tactical ability)
*DEDICATED/RESPECTFUL (this is a game for 7 people... I have seen people last with "1 unit" up until the bitter end... even if you are losing, you need to respect your fellow gamers, and play your peices untill the game is over or untill you have no peices left)

if you are lacking in these areas, this game is not for you, if you meet this criteria, then i hope you can research/learn/and play this game...


I WANT to play this again, but i would prefer to play it with people i know over the web interface... I'm trying to influce people to play now

The great conceit of this game: no luck (aside from starting position assignment), and a very simple combat system, is a really worthwhile idea.  Though I am no fan of reality television, this game is good for the same reason "Survivor" remains watchable after so many seasons: the different mix of personalities always makes the games/seasons different each time around.

I really love this game. No luck involved, very tactical and after three rounds everybody is completely paranoid. It is hard to get 7 players together though.

I may have to try this game online, but as a board game, it has one inbuilt flaw that totally breaks it for me - and that's NOT the backstabbing aspect. It's player elimination combined with an extremely long play time. There is no better way to spoil a good evening with friends. Or, even worse - plays where a player is only almost eliminated, but still forced to watch the game without having much to contribute. That is not only insuling to friends and/or guests to someone's house, it is also the opposite of what a board game should do.

There are other, much better games with similar elements, like Junta (because it offers different ways of escaping from a dreadful position, while it's also very humrous and has more exciting moments), Game of Thrones (because it's more thamtic, more random and has limited play time), or simply Risk (because it's short with missions).

Truth be told, this is a hard game to rate. I highly recommend everyone to play at least one game of diplomacy. It's a one of a kind experience.  So with that out of the way, here are my thoughts:

First, playing online at Dipbounced.com is far and away the best way to play this. It actually captures the spirit of the game better than playing face-to-face with friends. 

The main drawback for me is that it is just too long of a game and even then it can end in a stalemate.

I own one of the big flat-box editions with the wooden bits.  Apart from the length of the game, which makes it more suited to the masses of play-by-email options out there, it's hard to find a better pure negotiation game.  There's a reason the game has been popular for over 40 years, and it's aged quite well.

  This looked like such a great game, but it proved to be the worst gaming experience of my life.  A real "feel-rotten" game, where negotiation, deceit, and backstabbing are a must.  I play games to feel good, not bad.  This one makes me feel bad.

When you have a group of competent and mature players, the race each turn to connive things your way, to rescue situations going badly, to truly see how things all around the board are affecting each other, and manipulate them and take advantage of them ... it can provide an adrenalin rush and a satisfaction hard to find in other multi-player games. I'll tend to only play it by email now, preferring it to face to face (unless all the players know what they're doing, and are game-mature, which can be hard to find).

I try to give unbiased reviews and so my rating is not based on my personal preference but on how well the game is made for it's particular category of game.  It's an 8.5 at what it does.  It is a negotiation game.  Purely negotiation - forming alliances and backstabbing.  You should set aside a whole day to play it.  So if you are into that, then you will certainly like this game.

My favorite game of all times. The brilliant simplicity of the mechanics is unsurpassed, I believe, and the theme is compelling. The only problem with this game is that it ruins friendships... The absence of luck is really a crucial component. The only downside is that it's hard to collect seven people for a board game that lasts forever. I have never finished a game in real life. But the game lends itself perfectly to playing by email or, in the old days, by letters.

A game I played a lot when at school. Found people either loved or hated it. The more players you can get the better. Not likely to find enough players willing to play this nowadays, and anyway I can think of lots of other games that I would rather play instead.

I used to LOVE this game (would have given it a 10), back in the days when we had TIME (read: student days). Been there. done it, now I don;t bother anymore.

I would still recommend everyone who hasn't tried it yet to try it, since it's a classic and would be a shame not to have played this at least onece in your life.

Diplomacy-type games are not really my cup-of-tea anymore. Players approach it too differently, which can really turn it into a frustrating experience.

A classic that relies on the duplicitous nature of us all. No luck, pure negotiation and clear written instructions. No matter how casually a game begins within a couple of turns everyone will be sharpening their knives.

Personally I play this game in as relaxed an atmosphere as I can muster and luckily those I've played it with have been very reasonable and rational players.

Whilst I am aware that the game has very exact rules with regards unclear orders or ambiguous situations I would hate to play this with anyone who stuck rigidly to these. As far as I am concerned if a ghist was clear enough and others agree then that is good enough for me and my group.

I like playing this from time to time. It's best with the full player count. Some games are very dynamic and exciting, others can be frustrating if players form early alliances and won't budge on them. I think it's best when all players are total strangers.

UPDATE: Traded at "Alphaspel" in Sweden. I really would like to play this one more time at least. But I see it hard find 7 people (optimum sweet spot apparently) who are prepered to play this Marathon game for 7 hours in a row.

***

I never thought that I would get my copy of Diplomacy to the table. But I did - at least once I did.

After 3 hours "Germany" flipped and start yelling to us all just before he left the table for a poker game with some others playing at the same place. Of course, we had a great time and the game had been really tense and interesting up to this point. We were five remaining players that continued the pursiut of dominating Europe. But you know what, in 4 more hours nothing more exiting really happend. We tried to attack and make pacts, but it became a stale game with rather fixed borders. We ended the game after over 7 hours, that was before any official winning conditions was reached. We just choosed the leading player as the winner.

It started really fine and it provided a nice psychological drama, but in the end it just gave me headace. I think Imperial and Struggle of Empires have just as strong meta-game as Diplomacy, but they are more distinctive and have more paths and options.

In some aspects Diplomacy felt like a light game. But the the part of resolving combat/bouncing were rather complex at times.

If you have 7 people and lots of time this can be a great experience.

I play with the Windy City Weasels in Chicago and it's a great group of guys who are very nice.  Come join us.  We play at least once a month and even get 2 tables going so we have a large group.

I can see why they call this game a way of life.  It took me a year of playing to get decent at the tactics, the strategy and of course the negotiating.  I will be a learner for a long time.

If you haven't played Diplomacy don't dare to call yourself a gamer! The game teaches you a lot about how people think and how the world works. This is the sum-of-all-games (IMHO).

Suggestions:

1) Only play with 7 players.
2) One game in an evening does not makes sense, thus: Play in a one-year-per-week concept, for instance at your work place.  See the social structures evolve. Backstabbing colleagues. Eavesdropping. It's all in the game! (One of the few times that the blurb on the box actually does not promise too much).
3) To maintain the administration and (essential strict) deadlines for handing in moves, use an on-line arbitrator robot ("judge").
4) Don't need to actually BUY the game. Just print a map and the rules. So, best game ever AND free. What more does a person want?

THE classic strategy game.  Easy rules.  Play 3-4 players to learn. 7 is very tense from the start.  There are no dice or cards for luck -- everything is negotiations with the other players.  To do well you'll need to make alliances.  To win, you'll need to backstab your allies.  Can jeopardize friendships if taken too personally and not all personalities should play this game.  Excellent played possibly in somewhat abbreviated fashion as a classroom exercise grades 9-12 for world history and geo-politics understanding.

A total classic. An old game, but a design master piece. People still play massive tournaments of this game. It takes the negotiation game system and boils it down. So the rules are real simple.

An excellent, almost perfect game.  Simple rules, but very complex gameplay.  Played it often in high school so many years ago.

I own three copies of this game I no longer like and will no longer play - after scores of FtF, snail mail, and e-mail games. (Most before BGG was created, so not noted here.) Kissinger, who like myself is a former diplomat and learned in diplomatic history, reportedly is a big fan of this game. Probably our differences IRL and on this game stem from the fact that he is ok with a diplomacy that is far more devious than that which I support.

RATING: 3
I guess I understand why this game was huge in its day, but man do I hate it.  Hours upon hours of waiting for players to be eliminated.  Huge downtime issues, very very dry and mechanical and you have very little control over your own fate.  If it played in half the time, it would still be too long.  If it were twice as dynamic, it would still be boring.  Interaction with other players does not constitute an entire game.

Tons of interaction between players, however I feel like there is too much time spent doing nothing in this game.  The idea of a variable endgame is interesting in theory, but in application it turns into a fest that can last (literally) forever.  Negotiation and backstabbing rule the day, but they can take a LONG time to get through.  Even after orders are in, you need a flowchart to determine what goes where.  Play A Game of Thrones if you're looking for a game that just kept most of the good parts of Diplomacy.

To be fair, I was setup to dislike the game.  At the 2008 Buckeye Games Fest they needed 2 extra players so that they could start the Diplomacy Tournament.  I agreed to play.  I entered a metagame unlike anything else I had ever been in before.  These guys knew what they wanted and how to totally manipulate the new guy into getting it.  In the end, I lost all of my blocks except for one, and was stabbed in the back by so many people and with so much subtlety that I still don't know who did it or when.  Perhaps this game is fun, perhaps it is brilliant, but not in my book.

Better than Lethal Weapon 2 

I only play it online and my attempts to run games IRL have been failures. The betrayals can hurt and allies can be frustrating but you'll learn to accept that. 

It's not balanced, I have not enjoyed stabbing friends, but I love it. 

One of my favourite things when I play I enjoy making up fake newspaper headlines describing the events. Sure there isn't a whole lot of chrome with supply lines or internal governance but it is streamlined to focus just on what matters.

The negotiations can be too long.  You have to play with a timer.  Those who don't write their orders by the time the timer goes off are assumed to have no orders.  Major problem with this one is getting enough people who want to play (exactly 6 in my book), the time required to play, and early player elimination means that someone is going to sit around for a few hours with nothing to do.

02/08/16 (P): Why do I have bad feelings about this game, I suspect I am about to be stabbed!
09/08/16 (P):Gunboat variant: Am on my way out of this one as E against a F/G combination. have weakened F but not long to survive here methinks. Although suspect G may now cruise through F.
09/08/16: (P): Much better here but stalemated in North. hoping southern allies get the breakthrough which will give a chance for a push.

05/11/16:(P): Dis - There could be a break through coming!
20/11/16:(P): Danaerys: Opening up but could go either way! Interesting to see next turn!

06/02/17: (P): Krukhut: Trying to push a new alliance & Danaerys: Trying to stave off an attack!
09/02/17: (P): Looks like possible game end as a draw, not a lot I can do about it.
09/03/17: Played intimate Diplomacy ( 2 player version) - excellent 2 player game.
07/04/17: (P): Krukhut. Hmm - well the stab has hit - can I hold the line - only time will tell.
01/05/17; (P): Danaerys: Now the battle commences.
12/05/17: (P) Krukhut: Time to form Le Grand Alliance:
13/06/17: (P): Danaerys: Hmnn going out here, Turkey has got A/F/I/R all under control. Grrrrr
26/06/17: (P): Kruhkut: Oh well, no one is listening, so we will all go under one by one!
16/07/17: (P): Danaerys: Looks like I am going down - all of them under Turkeys thumb. Won't give up tho!
23/07/17: (P): still unsure which way this one is gpoing.
11/08/17: (P): Danaerys: 6 way draw - better than expected.
11/08/17:(P) Kruhkut: Stuck in a hole!!!
01/10/17:(P) Very frustrating, having to defend against a leader , whilst other country gets undeserved 2nd, and two others fight each other and ignore the rest of the board! Grrrrr.
05/11/17: (P) Krukhut. See previous comments - Frustrating:
23/11/17: (P) Kruhkut. Not my happiest game.

? - I bought this game several years ago as a replacement for risk, dice do not generally like me.  I have opened it, read the rules, prepped the game, and never once been able to convince enough people to give it a shot to the point that Diplomacy has become a running joke that the game is in fact meta-diplomacy because in lieu of playing it most of my group would rather play anything else and they will begin negotiations to play anything at all besides this.  I rather enjoy this almost as much as I think I would enjoy playing the game so it continues.

The primary problems are the number of players needed and the elimination factor along with the game length. Feel that later games such as Struggle of Empires, Pax Britainna cover the multi-player aspect better.

Also my rating reflects that I like the early and mid-game which I would rate a 9. However, I feel the game deteriorates as it goes along and I find the end game to be distinctly disappointing so I would rate that a 3. - Hence my 6 rating. 

The game would have been better to play a set or variable number of years, or to the first person to a say 10 or 12 centers - a good amount but not half the board.

IMO the game doesn't work if you haven't got 6-7 players. Too much to think if you have to concentrate more than one nation. Otherwise A classic.

I got to play this a lot during High School with my friends. We played so many games, including some online. Therefore it still has a warm spot in my heart, and I do still love it. But I've come to realize that the player elimination aspect coupled with long play time makes it incredibly difficult to get to the table, especially with the 7 player requirement. And even when I do get it to the table, something is missing when playing with newer/inexperienced players who don't know the nuances of the gameplay that can also really impact my enjoyment of playing this one. Still, I will almost always play this if there is a chance to--simply because it is so difficult to get a chance to play.

Much better than I expected after hearing so many horror stories, but I can see how this might go awfully wrong. Our group was fantastic, many of my close friends and easy going newcomers. But, the game itself is not really what makes or breaks the experience but the players and my rating incorporates the assumption that you play with the right group, because the game itself, in terms of design and intrinsic value is not necessarily that great (the basic idea is good). Still, a fantastic experience.

RATING: 10
Here's the thing - this is not a game for everyone. But in the same way that Go and Chess have a simplicity and elegance, Diplomacy is along the same lines. The simplicity of mechanics and the need to convince others to go along with your plan make this a perfect game for me. But being a perfect game doesn't mean I want to play it exclusively. In fact, I haven't played this game in years. The only randomness in this game exists within the minds of the players. It can be brutal, when backstabbing or being backstabbed, and that's really the only downside. It can sting when you trust someone and it all falls apart. I am told that some friendships have been damaged by this game. Playing online with strangers offers a clean slate every time.

RATING: 4
Great game!  I just recently discovered this game.  However, I am slightly concerned with how the game is played and how backstabbing seems to be a necessity to win.  I wonder if it would be interesting to have victory conditions.  One such condition could be that no one wins within a certain number of years.

Downgraded slightly.  Diplomacy is an odd game.  Victory conditions are too stern and you must play with a group of people at the same level.

Down graded even more.  Ok.  I no longer think this is a great game.  I think it shows its flaws.  There really is not that much diplomacy in games with experienced players.  It is just random stuff going on.  Sorry Jim, Doug, Edi, Laurent, and company.

Run from this! Try something else!

Mind you, this is after at least 10 ftf plays and 100 online plays.

Last time I played this I didn't enjoy it, but I would like to play it again just to see if I ever could enjoy it.

By far the best concept for a game I have ever experienced.
With the right group of people this transcends boardgaming entirely and becomes a dark and twisted form of LARPing.

The elephant in the room is that in execution, Diplomacy takes FOREVER to play through.  I'm talking 6+ hours if you do it without breaks.  Potentially a week if you want to eat and sleep.  And you absolutely must have a full player count.

My recommendation is to set up a Diplomacy day weeks ahead of time, with lunch and dinner pre-set for delivery, and allow no one to leave.
Will it be a boardgame day or the setup for a murder mystery?  Why can't it be both?  I mean, by the end you'll likely want to murder your friends anyway...

Keep your allies close, but your enemies closer.

I love this game. Everything about it is exactly up my alley. It is Risk, but instead of playing the game, you are "playing" the other players. It is all about having a silver-tongue and poisoning the minds of those else.

It unfortunately, takes forever to play (devote 4-7 hours depending on number of players, and even then, more if you have those who really want to win). You know how Mario Kart for the Nintendo64 destroys friendships?

This is the boardgame equivalent. Only those that can beckon the sociopaths and cold-blooded intentions inside of themselves will win this game.

I&#039;m beginning to feel burned with negotiation games - I&#039;ve discovered I haven&#039;t got the patience for endless discussions.

Great game but I have to take a deep breath to play - not really a good sign.

On the surface, this game is brilliant. It is the ultimate in zero-luck games. It's just you, a map of Europe in 1900, the opening position, and your opponents. After that's it's survival by your wits alone. Unfortunately, as this simulates the diplomatic efforts and command decisions that took place leading up to and including World War I, with no luck mechanic to blame when things go wrong, it gets pretty tense around the game table as nation after nation gets stabbed in the back or ganged up on. Not for the casual gamer or the faint of heart.  Beware this game's reputation: Where friendships go to die.

If you are able to keep things in perspective, Diplomacy can be fun. If you let things that happen "in game" carry over into other aspects of your life, then perhaps you should stay away.
It can be difficult to get all the people necessary to play and so I've only played it at conventions or Diplomacy events where there are usually three or four games in a two day period.
That being said, after one game I've had my fill. Two games in a day is just too much for me.

It emulates World War I in a luckless game of simultaneous movement through written (secret) orders to armies and fleets. Has good strategic depth, but victory cannot be achieved without skills on diplomacy and deceit. The game also needs seven players to work well and, therefore, its sessions can take a lot of time. A classic that will appeal only to gamers that can handle well the mandatory "backstab-to-win", player elimination and, above all else, the exhaustive amount of time that it takes to be played.

Have tried very hard to like it but have not managed it.  I respect the elgant idea of the game, but had trouble with the fiddly details and was really bugged by the back stabbing.  It is an elimination game.  You don't want to elimninate a player (because then they will be bored with nothing to do) but if you let them live you know you will regret it.  Takes far too long. If you are negociating with Germany for any length of time, everyone know that you may be backstabbing them.  
If I was ever going to try this again, I would do it play be email.  Having bought Game of Thrones, I doubt I will ever play this again.

Interesting conflict game - I don't know if I'd call it a full blown war game, but I guess it might be one.  I like the ideas presented and the mechanics, but not something that I'm clamoring to play again.  I don't have the commitment to be good at this game -- while not a life style game on the level of ASL, getting closer for sure.  A couple PBEM games convinced me this wasn't for me so I traded it away.

(When rating games I focus on the "how likely I am to play this game again" part of the BGG description rating, as opposed to the "quality" part of the rating.)

The downfall of this game is its duration--otherwise, the magnificently intricate planning and negotiation would catapult it to an emphatic 10.

I will never play Diplomacy face-to-face again, but I absolutely love playing via PEBM [backstabbr app]. Diplomacy shines when played via PEBM, due to the zero luck element, simultaneous order writing and resolution, without the 7-8 hours required to play in person.

Epic game of negotiation, deal-making and conflict. Players represent one of the seven Great Powers in the buildup to WWI. Each turn army and fleet orders are documented and revealed simultaneously to hold or move troops, allowing players to move their armies, take control of hotly contested supply centers (which expand armies), and displace opponents. Troop "support" from neighboring regions (provided by oneself or an ally) is key to winning conflicted regions. Support chain management and displacement of support are critical, but it is the timing of partnerships, when to ally, when to reneg on a deal, and the understanding and anticipation of other players' moves and motives that are key to winning

It's really easy to comprehend, though it does suffer the usual plague of world-war games: the areas are odd enough shapes that it's hard to keep track of which ones are touching.

Number of plays estimated. Only played the full version a few times, to the usual bitter hard feelings. I actually preferred it as a two player game. It then becomes more of a guessing game as you try to predict your opponent's moves and try to counteract them.

RATING: 9
With seven players who really get themselves involved in this game it is OUTSTANDING.  But as much as I like Diplomacy I can think of many hard feelings and arguments it has caused with family and friends over the years.  I originally played this game while in college in the 1960's. We played it both for fun and within a Military History class as part of an assignment.  I have the Games Research version copyrighted 1961.  Large map with one fold and nice large wooden pieces.

Without a doubt the most overrated game I have ever played.  Could be I just had some bad experiences at a convention devoted solely to Diplomacy.  Or maybe it&#039;s those Dippers who insist you can&#039;t play a &quot;tournament level&quot; game with 6 at a table (you can, but it requires something most don&#039;t possess: ingenuity).

I love this game, and I'm (probably) never playing it again.  It's not the game, it's me.  I get very uncomfortable with this kind of negotiation, and since that's the whole game, I don't really like it.  However, it is a truly beautiful concept, and I love the game design.  Best admired from afar (by me).

My all-time favorite board game. It takes forever, and you really should have 7 players for the best experience, but nothing comes close in terms of an immersive, exciting, and strategic experience.

Loved by Zillions - which just goes to show ....something. Unremittingly dull & mind-bogglingly pointless. Cutting up a block of cheese, distributing the pieces & then spending the night negotiating & backstabbing until the block is entirely in the possession of 1 player would be a preferable exercise to this AND probably closer to the 'theme'. Vapid, nasty & plays like an anesthetized version of Risk. Did I mention that I don't like it?

RATING: 6
I am of the belief that a proper play of Diplomacy must be done by e-mail, rather than face to face. It encourages the right attitude on private alliances. Diplomacy is an elegant game. It's simple, strategic, and carries with it a fantastic capacity for negotiation. I cannot, however, rate it highly because I'm rarely in the mood to invest the time and effort to play a game. 

Also, it is a frustrating game to play with people who have studied the stalemate positions on the board. I would much rather play it with people who haven't reverse-engineered the whole game. To keep the game fresh for me, I have specifically avoided such study.

It's no surprise it took Calhamer years to perfect the balance, and in this game of 7 world powers vying for control of Europe, you're only at a disadvantage if you fail to create (informal) alliances with your neighbors. No luck, just tactics and communication win this game. My favorite.

Okay, I played the computer version, and it was almost really brilliant there.  But from what I've seen of the way the board game version would be played, I don't know that I'll want to bring this out often.  It seems too easy for people to take betrayals personally, and the write-and-move mechanism seems to be clunky.  Having said that, I've never played the board game version before, so I can't know for certain.

There are no words to adequately describe how much I detest this thing (I won't call it a game because it's certainly not that). It is so mean-spirited by design that it can actually drive you away from board gaming as a hobby.

I probably couldn't count the number of miserable times I have had with this Diplomacy. The game itself has virtually no mechanics, so gameplay relies entirely on user interaction - before every turn players discuss with each other their plans for expansion and work deals out based on that. The way we played, everyone met each other one to one in private and exchanged their "strategies." What this boils down to is making empty promises, getting frustrated that other people break theirs, and way more time wasting than should be ever reasonable for a board game. Even worse, I have found that as time goes on people take the game more and more seriously and pretty much everyone gets angry and bitter towards one another. Not at all my idea of a fun board game night.

Difficult game to rate because I recognize the brilliance of it. The rules are incredibly simple, but the gameplay allows a deep and unique experience. 

I actually look for interactive and cutthroat games, but I just feel the human element in this one is more than I care for. So much of the game is in the negotiation part of the game. It is intensely social in that way. Reading emotions and making deals is what sets it apart from many other board games. While I may enjoy that once in a while, it's not the self-contained logic puzzle with clearly defined player actions that I normally look for. It brings in the messy world of human relations and all of their emotional reactions.

In the end, it's a game that I will come back to on the right occasion with the right group of people, but not one I want to pull out every week.

On the one hand, Diplomacy is a great bit of game design.  It features tough and interesting choices coming from a very simple set of rules.  On the other hand, you can't win without a) convincing someone to help you, and then b) stabbing them in the back.  I have resolved NEVER AGAIN to play this game with people I consider friends; it's just not worth it.

A classic from my youth. No game does a better job of leveraging the power of persuasion and maximizing the impact of betrayal. Hence its perfectly fitting name. I played many games in high school and college; I liked playing Turkey most of all.

In high school we played a format where one person was the moderator, and the game was played out on photocopies of the map with the unit placements drawn on them. A turn lasted a few days, which gave you time to do your wheeling and dealing without other players' knowledge. Then you submitted your orders to the moderator, who resolved the turn and handed out the updated maps. A game would take a couple of months to play; this was a really fun format.

Diplomacy's capacity to ruin friendships etc is greatly overstated, but just to be on the safe side make sure that you only play it with sane and relaxed folks. 

I think it is best played on a turn-a-week basis, or left set up for PBEM, as this allows plenty of time for thoughftul play, proper negotiation, and calming down (if required).

This is still one of my all time favourite games.  I don't think I've ever enjoyed a face-to-face game though, my love of the games derives from anonymous play-by-email.  The problem with face-to-face games is finding seven people who will commit the time it takes to play the game and play it in the right spirit (cut-throat, everyone for themselves, not bringing extra-game relationships into the game).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
One of the first games I played and one I value highly. The necessity (much, much higher then in AGoT) to plan together and in secret requires negotiations in private, making the 20 minute turns from rulebook very hard to reach if you're forced to talk with several parties. Also, none of my plays (one lasting three days) resulted in reaching the end game condition of world domination.

I therefore don't play it any more and find it best suited for online play and focused on player rankings, allowing the winning factions to share the points and victory. Would gladly play this with friends again over email if it were possible.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
In theory one of the greatest games ever. But in my opinion not playable as a boardgame, but only as PBEM. Takes at least a weekend to play and you always have to find seven persons to play. And these seven persons shouldn't be oversensitive, because this backstabbing can get pretty rough and nerve-racking. Never played this game to the end yet, and probably never will. But anyway, at least the game mechanics are great and it is a nice idea for a game.

RATING: 8
The first thing to remember is that Diplomacy is inherently unbalanced. Russia starts with 4 units. England has more fleets, but less armies. Austria, Germany and Italy have to contend 4 or 5 direct opponents compared to Turkey's 2. The second thing is that this game will take at least 6 hours, and that's with a moderator to keep time and hurry players along. There needs to be a place with multiple rooms so that people can deliberate their warplans without being overheard. The third thing is that this is not a wargame. There are four basic orders (each with their own nuances), but most of this game stems from having the better alliance and then possibly breaking it. This is the ultimate game to make friends fume and cry, and while that shouldn't put you off this game, it's definitely good to go in knowing that it's just a game! The game plays out in simultaneous turns with orders written down on a piece of paper and resolved once everyone has put in their orders or the time is up. This makes for exciting and tense play and most of the time, there isn't too much downtime as players will always be talking with each other or watching the outcome of everyone's orders. This is a very exciting must-play game for the right people if you can find seven mature players, a moderator (ideally), 6-8 hours of free time and a place with plenty of places to talk. Otherwise, it can be difficult to organise.

Ah, what a classic. I have to admit that I haven't played for years. It's not that I haven't had the urge, just that I've not found five or six other players who want to invest an entire afternoon backstabbing each other.

RATING: 9
This is my all-time favorite game. I would play it forever and always if I could. The complete lack of any random element makes this one of the purest strategy games I've played. The diplomatic/coercion element makes every game startlingly different.

There are really only two downsides to this game:

1. You must have EXACTLY seven people to play. Any fewer and the game gets ridiculously imbalanced. Any more and people have to be on teams. This CAN work, but nothing is worse than in-fighting on a team ruining your game.

2. While I am a big fan of asymmetrical gameplay, I feel that the starting positions for some countries are significantly stronger than others (*cough* France *cough*). This makes it hard to bring new people into the game, as they lack the acumen to turn that frown upside-down.

However, barring these two relatively minor complaints, this is my favorite game of always.

This game will hurt your feelings. The game mechanics are incredibly simple, so your strategy lies entirely in -- well -- diplomacy. Getting people to do what you want. Manipulation and negotiation in a very pure form. Naturally, this may include lying and backstabbing, and this is where folks get their feelings hurt, but it's part of the game. Diplomacy is the closest thing to being on the TV Show "Survivor" if you remove the starving, bad hygiene, uncomfortable quarters, and cameras...

RATING: 7
The epitome of classic boardgame.  It's main and only fault is it plays best with seven and probably only then as a PBEM kind of set-up over weeks and months.

RATING: 10
Classic game.  Have played face-to-face, PBM and PBEM.  I prefer face to face (so much you can do by just talking to someone) and the ability to make your "enemies" paranoid by just talking to their neighbors...about ANYTHING.  I've been playing 20+ years and it is still fun.

RATING: 8
Diplomacy itself is an outstanding game.  In my top 5 favorite of all time.  Nothing else really compares to it.  Player interaction is HIGH.  
However, do not buy the latest version featuring the box art in the picture given.  The components are absolute JUNK.  The manufacturer couldn't have done a poorer job choosing cheap cardboard components that are difficult to distinguish from one another.  The only thing worth using in the game are the rules which are well done.  I took the time to make a huge 8' by 6' map and use pieces made from a large wooden dowel.  The result is worth it.
Diplomacy itself is outstanding, this version of the game is NOT and is not reflected in my rating.

Everything everyone says is true, except I have never lost a friend playing it.  This is the game that made me realize I am a manipulative bastard.  The post-game Congress of Vienna bull sessions were sometimes better (and longer) than the game itself.  Best face-to-face, in my opinion.

I was introduced to this one afternoon in a six-player face-to-face game.  Much to my surprise, I found it to be a quite pleasant experience.  Since then, I have found myself playing through several games by email.  This has been even more fun -- so much so that I am afraid that it has spoiled the face-to-face game for me.  Still, I wouldn't object to giving this another go on the table.  The part of the game that holds the most interest for me is the jockeying for position that occurs early in the game.  After about the third or fourth year, I find I am less and less interested.  It seems at this point that the game is only truly interesting if you are intent on stabbing and winning alone -- and then only minimally of interest.  So far, we seem to have not evolved from our "Care Bear" ways, which means we tend to cut the game off sooner rather than later and start a new one :) [02/17/2008]

RATING: 6
A strange game indeed. I have it, read it, didn't get it, repacked it, forgot about it.
Seriously: I never fully understood the rules on breaking support etc. Too difficult to understand. And how about all that writing down orders... I don't really take to games that need a pen and paper. 
The negotiation and leaving dice behind is okay. But someone should invent an easier way of giving orders without need of a pen and paper. Furthermore I need rule clarification, major clarification (I can prove this game is to hard to interpret since even PBEM clubs need a referee to interpret what actually happens on the board.

Edit 6/2/08. Since yesterday we started a PBEM game complete with Gamemaster. That means that in all fairness to the game I need to adjust my rating since a 3 says one will never play the game again. Final decision may depend on the playability of the e-mail variant and I suppose factors as length etc.

29/02/2008 Ok, so now that I played PBEM Diplomacy, what is my verdict¦ I didn’t like it, and here is why. When I was still on the prowl for girls back in the day, I would write a lot of sms and e-mails to them with all sorts of garbage and indecent proposals of sorts. What I hated then is what I hate now: the waiting... Waiting for a reply when negotiating or waiting for a confirmation that someone (a temporarily ally for example) received your set of proposed orders, or not. Waiting for that ally to respond, hoping it's not a negative response since you only have an hour left for the deadline¦ All of this and more made me feel like I did when I was chasing after women back then: I loved the game: but hated the waiting. Like someone in our gaming group said: send mail F5 F5 F5 F5 F5, then phew¦ I think it says it all.
Besides that I really put in ALOT of time into this game, with excessive writing, 'cause I want to feel like I am a nation’s leader in heavy diplomacy. However, that excessive writing and agonising crunching over the game board on all options, costs tons of time. Time which is likely well spent when you are winning, but it feels less rewarding when you conjured up nice plan in several hours, only to be betrayed by your fellow players. Basically you fall into a downward spiral of: much time spent => orders do not deliver as promised => less time spent => less quality orders => more orders do not deliver => less time spent => less quality orders => etc. etc.
Also: because this game is very unforgiving it is important that you make sure everybody understands all the rules. Once a mistake is made - especially in the opening rounds (first year) - it is hard if not impossible to recover.
I will play Diplomacy again, but only face-to-face or in one weekend, PBEM is not my cup of tea.

This was a very fun playthrough with a full 7 player match. Italy got screwed, as is normal from what I understand, but my France held its own, keeping Austria, Germany AND maybe Turkey.... at bay.

It was a great time of diplomacy, broken promises, alliances that held to the very end, and bitter defeat for some (Italy had a single territory left when we called the match at the 10th turn due to time)

A true classic!

Played twice and never again. Long and tedious, Diplomacy is like jury duty. Jury duty where you are sequestered, the jury is divided on basic issues of the case, and you keep doing endless votes that fail to break the deadlock. Admittedly, jury duty would be more exciting if it included seeing Austria-Hungary getting back-stabbed by Turkey.

Diplomacy is a highly stressful tense emotional roller coaster ride. There's no other experience quite like it. Playing with players you know is a much better experience.

Diplomacy takes out any luck elements and forces players to interact and join forces to obtain power. It really makes the game live up to its name with lots of negotiations, treaties, back-stabbing, spying, revenge etc.. It's a good game but the downtime and potential stalemates can drag the game down. It's much better as a play-by-email game.

Első játékra úgy érzetem nem lesz az én játékom, de érzem, hogy mély lehetőségek vannak ebben a játékban, a profik bizonyára nagyon jó partikat játszhatnak le vele.

There's so little detail in the military aspect of the game that really it could have been anything else without anything being lost; rather than armies and fleets taking over supply centres to make more armies and fleets it could have been investors putting money in businesses to make more money. There's no morale, no terrain (so for example defending in Italy isn't any easier than attacking in Russia), no quality (so for example a Russian army will fight as well as a German one even though the actual warfare of the time shows very much otherwise), no supplies (so an army half the continent away will fight as well as if it was in its country's capital). Clearly the board was designed to make numbers and therefore alliances the key to winning even though in real life leadership, training and better weapons make the difference. When the board could as easily have been anything else there isn't much point to there being physical locations at all; it could have just been a series of counters and tracks and instead of moving pieces around you just negotiate for this and that which is really all the game is anyway.

A strategy game with no luck except selecting what country a person plays. I love it. The negotiating phases are great. The troop movement and attack mechanics makes players think a few turns ahead.

I respect the design of the game, but I just get no enjoyment out of playing this.  I liken the game to 7 people driving bumperboats in the dark.  You simply must work with someone else for anything to be remotely effective otherwise you bump around blindly until someone does something stupid or the results of the chaos fall in your favor. Generally, when you decide to work with people you end up relying entirely on other people's lies.

So much time is wasted over a couple simple movements.  More often than not you just end up wasting your turns getting bumped.  This game feels like moving one step forward and one step back. More often than not you end up bumped or defending yourself to hold which is more or less the same as losing your turn.  There are very few games that I even remotely enjoy that have the ingenious "Lose your turn" aspect.

My experience with Diplomacy was an excercise in balancing irritation and boredom.  I normally love negotiation games, but this game is a joyless soul eater.

The game is clever.  I am fascinated by (war)games that have no room for chance.  However.  Game ratings cannot be made without taking into account your experience playing them and I have never played a game that didn't end up in anger for everyone.  Fans will say we're immature, but I find the players who like this game are not players I'd like to sit at a table with.

Poker is a fantastic game, but I would not be able to stand 5 minutes sitting next to the clowns in the Poker Championships.

Wow - so after one play, I'm inclined to give this a 9.  Due to player elimination, though, I have to hesitantly place it at 8 for now.  But the experience is just so much fun, and tense as heck.  For a game with such SIMPLE rules, it has amazing depth and tension.  I loved our first play.

RATING: 9
A classic design, my favorite as a teen.  As I've aged, though, I've found that all the lying and scheming required really isn't my cup of tea.  This game does maintain the distinction of forcing me to buy my one and only jar of model paint.  I simply could not abide the ghastly dingy blue-green of the French units, so I took matters (and baby blue paint) into my own hands.  The results were quite satisfactory, if one were prepared to overlook the bits of newspaper stuck to several of the French armies.

While this isn't a bad game quality-wise, it is not a game I wish to play.  It's a long game that can generate many bad feelings between people, as in order to get ahead, you do have to lie and backstab at important moments.  I don't mind this in a shorter, lighter game, but Diplomacy is a longer and involved game that I don't enjoy playing.

I ran a few games of this when I taught, and it was a hit. I enjoyed it, even from the outside, but would like to actually PLAY a lot more.

For what you get out of this game, it takes far too long to deliver. There are better and shorter negotiation games. That said however, if you absolutely must have something of significance on the line in a negotiation game, this kind of works since you have hours (or weeks, if PBEM) of already invested time when it looks like you might lose. For me, if I want a high stakes game that gives me what Diplomacy gives me, I'll play some for-money Texas Hold Em.

Played with the right kind of people (either really close friends or persons you'll probably never meet again), Diplomacy is a fantastic game.

Is there another game out there which is this well-loved despite significantly unbalanced starting power levels?  I think Diplomacy gets off easy on the strength of its core movement/combat system (which is incredibly well-designed) and the fact that it's quite unique.  But the reality is that the "diplomatic" aspect of the game usually lasts for about 3-5 turns at the beginning, then crops up again when the 3-4 players at the end re-draw alliances based on the map.  Given all that, it's just not worth the time commitment to play this game FTF (not to mention the difficulties associated with plotting with your friends/enemies--everyone rushing off to a different room in pairs and feeling obliged to talk to **EVERYONE** else so as not to give anything away).

As a PBEM game, though...It's markedly better.  Perhaps the single best PBEM game I'm aware of.  The game is practically designed for it.

No luck but I really don't like the mechanics of this game.  So much effort is required to plan everything properly with the other players that it really isn't worth playing.

Player interaction is at the heart of Diplomacy. The game mechanics are simple, even dull and boring, but the board and pieces are secondary in Diplomacy, will you stay true to your word, wil you betray an ally at an opportune moment, will they betray you? This intrigue lies at the heart of Diplomacy, a game infamous for ending friendships. It can be very difficult to gather a group, willing, able and mature enough to play, but when a game can be formed, all players will be rewarded with a unique experience that should not be passed up!

have very little interest in playing this now hence lowered rating. That's not to say it isnt a well conceived system; the problem is: absolutely dry (it functions exactly as abstract) and it's too long for this sort of thing. There's not much history here. It's a sad comment on the culture of the 1970s that people started playing this by mail and such. It's not worth that sort of investment but the alternatives were: Cosmic encounter, dungeons and dragons and that play by mail spaceship thing.

wonderful game.  This one usually ends with everybody angry and cursing the fact they were the first out.  It is the only game that gets me genuinely worried that the game may end abruptly and only for me.  I love that this game has pretty much zero luck except for maybe your country draw at the start.

For anybody thinking of purchasing, try to find the previous edition out there anywhere you can because it comes with some very nice metal components that make a big difference in my opinion(though, the map is not as pretty).  Also, be wary of playing time.  The hardest part for me in this game is convincing people to finish.  Since it does not end at the same time for everybody that is another thing to consider.  But on the flip side, what other game plays 7?

This stalwart has been played F2F, by post, by email, and online. It's advantage is that it can run in the background as another game, while you get on playing other stuff over a gaming weekend. Just don't let your emotions affect your game-play elsewhere and vice versa. Some of the variants can be good too, including a Scots Clan one that then led to a combined Diplomacy-DBM-style campaign.

The classic diceless wargame, but pretty much requires players to backstab.  I love multiplayer conflict games, but the backstab is something that should be an option, best kept in your backpocket, not something required to advance your chances to win.

Not to play again.

I only played once, for about 8 hours, and we didn't finish the game. I love the element of persuading someone to protect you while you stab them in the back with a smile. I only wish the game itself were meatier. All the meat of this game comes from the players, not the game. The simplicity is brilliant, yet makes it feel like it's missing something.

An interestig game. Only played it three or four times many years ago. One thing I don´t understand are the claims, that you shouldn´t play this with your friends. Even if you are a sore loser (I can be!): Why sould you hold a grudge over a game??? I mean, if you can´t take a backstabbing in Diplomacy why should you take an attack in any other game less personal?

Pointless if played quickly, tedious if played properly. It has a combat engine, but really it's a bluffing game, only you're expected to be tactful and polite (diplomatic, even!) instead of merely deceptive -- at least, if you want people to work with you. Give me fighting with a little more flash, or let's just play Go instead.

In terms of raw game quality Diplomacy probably deserves a better ranking than this. But at this end of the scale the real criterion is "Which game is a less colossal waste of my time", and Diplomacy is a very long game.

Wow, what a thrilling game!  I was apprehensive going in to my first game of Diplomacy, due to all of the stories that you hear about ruined friendships, etc.  Our first game was completely absorbing the entire six and a half hours we played!  I can't wait to get this to the table again, or to play by email!  The strategies are deep, the tactics are edge-of-the-seat exciting, and the alliances are unstable at best.  Excellent game!  If only it wasn't quite so long.

A 7 with 7 players, a 3 or worse without.  With the full complement of players, this is a definitive negotiation and deception game.

A perfect blend of psychological and strategic gameplay, Diplomacy is my favorite game of all time. It is not a perfect game. The game is very long, there is player elimination, and it can take some time to get comfortable with the concept of physically writing orders. Despite these flaws, it remains my favorite game of all time.

The rating is based off playing with 7 players. Playing with less players drops the score dramatically.

I play this mainly at http://www.dipbounced.com

Diplomacy is the ultimate game for testing your skills in manipulating and reading other players. It is not a very [i]Challenging game[/i], and its [i]Variety[/i] is limited by its fixed starting position and a lack of any random elements; however, it has the highest [i]Atmosphere[/i] of any game I have played. The skill of [i]Gamesmanship[/i] is an absolute requirement for this game. In order to derive fun from Diplomacy, you must embrace and personify the concepts of betrayal, lying, and manipulation, but you must recognize the boundaries between the possibility space of the game and reality.

Love, love, love the theme! World leaders negotiating World War I, so cool! At least I think it is. Mechanics are complex but also great once you get the hang of them. There are many rules for movement, and since it is simultaneous you can wind up with weird corner cases. That doesn't bother me though. In fact, it is actually a plus since it adds to the tactics of the game and makes you feel like a scheming war-strategist managing to pull of an unlikely maneuver.

Unfortunately it is way too backstabby to play with friends, which kind of ruins it for me. It's also player elimination, which sucks.

Have not play this friend destroying game in a long long time. But there was a period of time when I play nothing else. First played Diplomacy at 14 and couldn't afford to game. I loved it so much I made a hand made version. I can see myself playing this again once I am stuck in a retirement home and I have 6 others I can convince to play. This game is diplomacy pure and simple. Such simple elegant rules that has generated many of my all time favourite gaming memories. I should do PBEM, sigh there is never enough time.

One of the best games i have ever played!  Loved it back in college when i was able to get a group of people together for 2-3 hours.

Nothing left to chance.  All strategy and negotiations!  The key is to know who to screw and when to screw them, as well as who to trust and when to trust them.

Best played with all 7 players.  (FYI - Austria was nicknamed "Dogmeat" in our games...)

A phenomenal game that brought hours and hours of excitement and fun.

Diplomacy is certainly not for everyone, but it's also certainly for me.  I love playing this online at www.dipbounced.com because I have a terrible poker face, which is a must for playing this in person.  I'm one of those people who thinks you shouldn't bother playing with less than 7 players, but if you've got 7 people with a whole day to spare (who won't stop being your friend because you backstab them), then this is the best game out there.  The lack of luck and the myriad strategies, combined with the player interaction, make this game a classic.

THE classic strategic diplomacy game, still top of the hill in its category. There is no randomness and all depends on your ability to use your strategic and diplomatic skills to get ahead. Important to have the right group of people though, and playing with tournament rules if you play live is a must as not to make it take too long. (Better play to sessions with different countries.) This game is _really_ good over the internet, by PBEM for example.

Early Avalon Hill edition - I really want to play this game, but getting 7 players together (nobody seems to want to play with fewer than 7) has been a show stopper.  Plus, the rules and note-taking abbreviations are hard to realize until actually playing, so I'm not sure how it will go when I ultimately play.  I've heard at the very least you lose all your friends!

It's a sport rather than a game, and it's really not that much fun.  When you leave a game session wiped out, angry at others, and generally downright tired from the game experience - how can that be fun?  I give it a "3" instead of a "2" because it is an excellent teaching tool.  A tool, not a game.

Unplayed....every time i think about walking my group through this game, I just say screw it.  

There are two weak gamers in our group that need to be helped through some pretty simple stuff.... add in the concept of written orders, and I think it may be too much for me to sit through.

Don't take this as a complex game though..... my friends tend to the stupid is all.

I don't mind giving up a day of my life to play Diplomacy every once in a while, but it needs to be played correctly. My group would play until the point of 3 or 4 players remaining and share the victory, and this changes the entire dynamic of the game. The weakest player just gets picked on over and over again, and the major powers never have any reason to pick fights, because they know that ultimately they'll both win. It's not much of a game when played that way.

Used to play this on the judges, and switched to the 1900 variant after a while. The king of negotiation games, and still quite a bit of scope for actual move-by-move analysis. But it just takes so much time... Online games with full press will last months and require huge commitment, which feels less and less tempting.

RATING: 7
Pros: influential area control game, strategic negotiations make up bulk of gameplay, extremely high level of player interaction, moderately tactical, no luck

Cons: player elimination, extremely lengthy playtime, limited player count, extremely prone to devastating kingmaking

I don't own the physical game and have only played face-to-face a few times and only ever with sub-optimal number of players. Obviously, this game is best with seven, and except perhaps for the Escalation variation (haven't tried that yet), I would only ever suggest it when seven players are available. However, if six of my friends and I ever had an afternoon completely free, I would petition HARD to get this to the table! I play  online regularly, and it is superb!

A nearly perfect game, when you can get the players and time lined up. I once spent a whole summer playing by mail with friends. We were so into it, we put out a little newspaper and wrote our own articles for it. I can admit that here. After all, this is BoardGameGEEK.

Great game, almost to the point where I think it should be required playing in high school.  Needs a good group of friends.

The best games I've had were ones we played at work, with one major turn a week.  Talk about a productivity killer, we'd see a closed office door and the BS would start.

FtF is ok.  E-mail's better, but I like the chance to savour and plan with weekly FtF.  The e-mail games are either too rushed or they don't complete intact.

A very long 7-player strategy game, which often is made into an all-day event. Which is why I haven't played it in over a decade. This is the board game that chess masters seem to like the most. You can now play for free online, with everyone taking a turn each day (or week) and then discussing and negotiating with other players between moves. I only give it a '7' rather than a '10' because I just don't like long games anymore, though I'd love to play this once every few years if I can get the right group of folks together.

This is one of those games that I can lean toward any way on any given day.  
   The thing is, it just plays way too damm slow.  I mean, I know some war games are slow, but Diplomacy is slowwww.  And don&#039;t even bother playing this game with just you and one other person. (so many damm orders to write!) Might as well write a book on what you&#039;re going to do next!
   But I guess on the positive side, it&#039;s a great strategical war game, and gets quite interesting with more players involved.  And the ironic thing is that the less coutries you own, the less orders you usually have to make.
     I liked this game at first, I really did, but when I played it between my friend and I, we ended up talking about what we did that day more about writing our orders down.  This game is definetely for the &quot;hard-core geeky spend my entire day of how to write my orders out&quot; type of war-gamer
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
The game is absolutely fantastic ! The simple rule set system, enables players to be much more creative and gives the player more storage memory for strategy instead of rule memorizing. Also the secret diplomacy makes the game very intense and alive with lots of nasty surprises. This game is not for little kids or for the pacifistic recourse gathering types. A man to a man a wolf. 

Any way I would have given it, even a higher score if it wasn't for the time issue. A game takes at least 6 hours and if all the players are well balanced then it might not end at all. That is why I barely played plus it's hard to assemble 5+ players for a 7 hour game.

Probably the most rewarding game ever.  Definitely the most emotionally exhausting.  The tactics and strategy are minimal; the negotiation is what lends this game its timelessness.  A must have game for anybody with a game library.  Period.  This game almost seems made for play by email, which is odd considering that it's been around much longer than electronic communication.  PBEM allows players to dictate pace as they wish, and put as much time as they wish into the game.  It takes longer that way, but makes for even more tension.

I have played this couple of times as a teenager and two full games as an adult. First one was an email game second one used playdiplomacy.com as platform. One of the rare games which I prefer to play without sitting around the table, because it is good to have secret negotiations as secret and it is easier to stay within the time limits.

A classic game, simultaneous order phase followed by simultaneous action phase. It works quite nicely after you understand the basic of the rules (couple of rounds of the first game should be enough). The trick is that alone you can't accomplish that much, you need allies and you need to make some deals. And the backstab and get backstabbed. Not a game for everyone, I admit.

This is the game that doesn't end... Or it seems like it. Unfortunately it is also the game I get to play least-regularly.

I love and hate this game at the same time. Seriously, this game can really tell something about your personality. When we played it at a games weekend a while ago, and we refered to moves after we finished, the others could totally tell who was which country. In addition to that screwing people over is remembered and being used in future games (even if they're totally different games) Over a year after one particularly nasty game people were still talking and apologizing about 'attacking warsaw'.

Reduced the score from 8 to 6. As I only play online, it's hard not to find cliques of players that refuse to actually negotiate because they are already organising things between themselves.

I used to love this game when I was a teenager, I played it all the time with my friends. More than twenty years passed and I tried the game again in 2003. I just hated it with passion! Did the game change? Surely not! But I did, I'm a different person than I was in my teen years and this game simply doesn't do it for me anymore. The playing time is too long and the need for backstabbing just kills the enjoyment for me. But I can understand that some people will love it dearly and give it a 10.

So simple, but human interaction facilities almost all the fun. And it IS fun. This game made me feel emotions I'm not sure I've ever even felt before... deciding when to betray someone, having a great offer come in from someone that you're not sure that you can trust, taking the offer, then instantly feel torn as you talk with your old ally. I've never mentally flip-flopped with my decisions in such a short period of time ever before. I was 100% dedicated to starting a huge war one min, then 100% against it the next due to some negotiations. 

From a immersion and break from reality/unique experience perspective, playing this with 5 other new players was unmatched. As a game, while I love the simplicity and understand why it's kept simple, it might be a little TOO simple for my own personal tastes. It also is a bit lacking in other game features, like requiring you to manually write out orders meticulously, or have a physical gaming space where you can get away from other players to scheme, or even being short enough to be able to actually finish a game in a session. The profound experience does counter-act most of these issues fairly well, though. My overall stance is that it's a brilliant, mechanically simple game akin to chess, but not a game I want to play constantly due to it's few but valid failings as a game.

After more plays, I can summarize this game as... frustrating. Either the fault is my own personality or the players I play with (Unlikely since I also play online with randoms and have similar experiences), but it seems many games come down to the same situation. I need to ally with the smaller of a 2 person alliance to backstab the dominant power who has overextended themselves. However, the smaller ally seems content with 2nd place and never does. I use logic. I appeal to their emotions. I appeal to friendship or metagame from older sessions... nothing works. 

This is a great game for the first 2-5 turns (and 2-5 hours) but it's like they forgot to design sensible end conditions and it just peters out into a frustrating mess or you get a victory because your ally was overly loyal. In summary, Diplomacy is a great system that desperately needs a redesign.

A nasty, nasty game. Interesting in the simplicity of the rules (a wargame with no random elements), but it is necessary to use treachery and backstabbing to win, and that leaves most of the players in a really bad mood. This would not be that bad, if only the game would not take so much to play. As it is, I woul rather not play it again.

RATING: 9
Like Civilization, Diplomacy is a classic hampered a bit by its playing length and player-number constraints (the game really does demand a full complement of 7 players to be balanced and fun). Oddly enough, Diplomacy perhaps plays better over email or through the post than it does on a table, face-to-face; the most enjoyable games I've ever played were done this way, and the best stories I've heard of the game were played this way. Internet play also makes it quite possible to enjoy the game without having to roust up 7 players all by yourself, and this is the way I cut my teeth on the game, playing solidly on the internet for three years or so.

Diplomacy is an unremittingly nasty, interactive contest that counts as much on your negotiation skills as it does on your tactical/strategic skills. If you take nasty player interaction personally, or don't like it, do not play the game. I haven't played it in years, and probably would only play it at this point with people I knew, and who I knew would not take the game personally.

I played this in the early 1980's & really enjoyed it enough to purchase a copy. Unfortunately once high school ended, I never met another group who wanted to play. This game did not survive my purge of the 1990's. Still, plenty of positive & some less than positive memories. Overall, a grand game.
Edit: I truly regret letting this game go, but, it was a logical decision to give it away.

RATING: 5
The luckless combat system and mutually beneficial co-operation combined with the art of the backstab make this game entertaining. But, it's long. Got through a couple of PBEM games years ago...used it as a Junior High History schoolteacher for the lessons on WWI and secret agreements. And once, as a party stunt. But it mostly gathers dust.

RATING: 10
Earns the perfect 10 despite its now-obvious flaws (player elimination, kingmaking, winner obvious well in advance etc.).  Combination of incredibly simple rules, with simultaneous moves and multiplayer strategic complexity - a game theorist's wet dream.  When I first met this game I couldn't think about anything else for weeks.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Always the first one eliminated. I would rate it higher if not for the high back-stab potential. I don't mind being deceptive, but I don't like lying. A strange distinction, but it's real for me. Admittedly, I do like playing The Resistance and Die Kutschfahrt zur Teufelsburg.

Best game ever made. A few warnings however: Don&#039;t play the game with less then seven players. Don&#039;t play the game with people who needs to go home at a specific time. Don&#039;t play the game with non-gamers. Don&#039;t play the game with people who can&#039;t accept lies. Don&#039;t start the game if not having 7+hours to finish. i.e. not a game you play very often.

Still it&#039;s well worth it&#039;s ten and I would rate it even higher if possible.

I don't really consider this my "gateway" because it didn't get me wondering what else was out there, but it was my introduction to hobby gaming. This is an absolute blast to play if you have the right group of people and a total nightmare with the wrong group. It's almost pure negotiation (though I think being able to see unconventional maneuvers and a few turns in advance is an under-appreciated key to victory), and it can get nasty. You really need to be able to leave things at the table. It also takes so long to play that I've never actually finished a game; usually after the second or third player elimination it's reasonably apparent who would win and we negotiate a ceasefire. The mechanics also make this a near-perfect play by e-mail game, and I've run several successful games this way. Not for everyone, but when it works, it's great.

RATING: 7.5
I'd refer to this game as the closest to multiplayer chess. On the plus side, there is no element of luck involved. You practically control your destiny with your own two hands. The rules are pretty straight forward and there is no downtime as each round is resolved simultaneously by all players involved. There is intense diplomatic bartering between players and this tends to appeal to all involved. On the negative side, you absolutely need 7 players present for the game to be properly played otherwise the ballance of the game is seriously ruined. Another big minus is that in the mid game inevitably some players are eliminated or fall so back that they have no chance to win the game and thus can loose interest. This I believe is the most serious defect of the game. Who wants to sit and observe others play while he sits back and does nothing for 2-3 hours?

I love this game. The negotiations are the best part. Trying to decide who to befriend and if and when to betray them is the key to the game. Not good for people who hold grudges. Downside is you really need 6 or 7 players and that's not always easy to come by.

One of my favorite games although I have not been able to play it that often. On the first game I ever played two of my friends got into such a fight that they didn't talk to each other for half a year. This is how intense this game can be.
The game is all about communication. There is no luck involved in this game. You try to get other players to do things that are favorable to your own strategy and you to that by trying to talk them into it. With 7 players that is a monumental effort, to prepare strategies turns ahead, to coordinate and to have things playing out over multiple rounds... the name of the game is really the best fitting one they could have picked.

I have not lost a game yet, and nor do I intend to ;) This game really brings out my manipulative evil side. Hehehe

Difficult to get game together - time and participants.  Also some fault for having an "elimination" element (i.e., some become bystanders before the end).  Otherwise, I've rarely encountered a game structure that requires as much long-term planning, collaboration, cajoling, threatening, deceipt, and other forms of immersive behavior.  Best when everyone is at same level and plays "hard".  Very rough when one or two members of the group are lighter gamers.

RATING: 5
It's a classic, and a truly great design. But for me, three things stand out: (a) the illusion of control, (b) the ambiguity of the victory conditions (draws are...what, exactly?), and (c) the primacy of conspiracy over negotiation. The simultaneous resolution system is mostly clever (and would be entirely so were it not for stalemate lines), but it's too long and too random. The nastiness I rather enjoy, but early player elimination in such a long game is unforgivable. What kills this for me, though, is the fact that information you don't, and can't, know is what has the most import on your position.

We're just not cut-throat enough to make this game work.  For the first half dozen turns the game is very dynamic as alliances shift and people feel out who they can trust.  A few people are eliminated and then we settle into two unbreakable alliances and everything just stagnates.

[Rating for online] [www.webdiplomacy.net] [www.playdiplomacy.com] Highly rated, and rightly so, for the negotiation element. My playing Austria as a new player was more than disheartening and cost me five years of happy gaming, so buyer beware. The variants purport to address geography and/or unit composition; when re-balancing is achieved I'd score the system even higher.

I have found playing Dip online, indeed Dip in general, makes more sense since the kids have arrived!

Speaking of Diplomacy (See Cutthroat Caverns), this game is the grandaddy of friendship killers. I still enjoy an occasional game for the sheer strategy that must be employed to win. However, because of its nasty and unpredictable nature, I tend to stay away from this one.

It is amazing what you can do in this game.  I can remember some games where although I was not a major player in any one conflict, I controlled the tempo of the board, something that is great to experience in any game.

Both a good and a bad game. It involves a lot of manipulation of your opponents, so if you're doing it with friends you better be used to double dealing each other in games.

Not being good at this title is not a bad thing, but more an indication you dislike manipulating others (or being manipulated).

Perfection. No luck, All conflict. filled with planning, deduction, deceit and strategy. You play the players as much as you play the game. Has some cons.. It really NEEDS a full 7 people to be played right. And it takes a long time. My group actually decided to play by making one move a week because it was near impossible to play in one gaming session. Even at that, because of the player count and investment it requires it doesn't get played as often as I'd like. When I do play it though it is such an incredible amount of fun that I can't imagine ranking it less than a perfect 10.

The no-turns mechanism is, I think, great in a war game. The fact there are no dice or other elements of pure chance in the actual play also makes for a great game. The name "Diplomacy" is perfect for this game because it's all about the negotiations and what you do or do not convince other players to do.

In university we had several games of this going in the dorms.  I was generally the moderator, and people would have to track me down twice a day to get their orders in.  The games would generally take a week or so to play and it got to the point where people were trying to hide tape recorders in my room where the board was set up to spy on other alliances.  I liked playing it in this fashion MUCH more than trying to play it in one night.  We've talked about trying to do a play by e-mail type of game but that has never come to pass yet.

I really think this is a masterpiece but I don't think I will ever play it again that is why I don't give this a perfect 10.  People just get too mad at each other.  I am able to put my emotions to the side when I play this but no one else can. People just get too mad so I will not play this again. *correction - I am pretty good at putting my emotions to the side, but being repeatedly betrayed by all players does test that as I recently found out.

Played again recently, and I am downgrading this game to an 8 (from 9.5) (may drop lower if I think about this more). Elegant design. Just no fun for most the players involved. Try getting backstabbed, then backstabbed, then backstabbed, then backstabbed. 

That first turn is one of the best experiences in games, in general. But the next 7 turns are not fun if you didn't make any inroads.

Only a couple of the countries are any fun to play. 

This is probably the first time I have dropped a rating after losing (I don't know if I have ever really dropped a rating). Normally that doesn't bother me - losing that is. But losing in this game is not fun; especially since hope seems to be there each turn. So you are brought up and then taken down, then up, then down. That last game I played was wicked. And I have completely lost my love for this game. I won't play this again. All I know is I played my last game honourably.

Now I am just plain exhausted. All my previous feelings are gone, and I just am plan done with the game. Can 100% say I am done with the game. this game takes too long (played it online over several days) - don't want to play a board game for a long time now. (game is now a 5) Elegant design does not equal fun anymore.

Played hundreds of times face-to-face and several times by e-mail or web. A game with multiple layers, most of which I really enjoy. The tactical rules are simple, yet allow for beautiful combinations; the negotiation multiplies the number of possibilities (even though I am not an expert at this part); and the tournament play adds even more subtleties. Reasonable people should understand that what happens in the game should stay in the game. I have met wonderful friends, visited lots of places, and had a lot of interesting experiences thanks to Diplomacy tournaments.

I'll echo that this a game to lose friends over.

My memory of playing involves getting back-stabbed by a very timid Luke Maxon. That was fun to watch.

If you're a good player, and the other players know it, you're toast. Or at least you should be. Between a set of equally good players, the toasting is arbitrary and there's nothing you can do about it. How is that a game? Interminably long.

(Trade Interest: high) i don't know if i could be convinced to play it.  probably not.  my experience with it has been universally lousy.  maybe it's because i don't like the pure negotiation aspect, and i'm not a politician.

One of my all-time favorite. It's better to play it through email rather than F2F (because stabbing someone you don't know more "comfortable").

RATING: 7.5
Enjoyable if long. Can be difficult to get enough players, and may lose friendships if people take things personally, remember it's only a game!! When you get a good group together to play it though, it can be a real pleasure.

RATING: 6
Fun game with the right crowd, but can get especially personal and nasty. Good for once a year or so, or via PBEM, but takes too long, and leaves too many bruised egos and hurt feelings to see the table more often.

I can see what people love about this game, but every time I have played it has been &quot;much ado about nothing&quot;: after hours of verbal wrangling and frequent backstabbing, the board looks suspiciously like it did at the beginning of the game.

Have owned the game for about 20 years but have yet to play a full game (did start some play-by-email games though). One of those games that you have to find a large group of like-minded people to play with, and sometimes that is hard to do.

For being as old as it is, the game has held up pretty well - the board is nearly pristine, and I still have most of the original country sheets that came with the game. The plastic pieces held up well, too - thankfully I thought to bag them all those years ago.

I like this game, though I've only played it twice (and neither time we finished...though it was apparent the second game who was going to win).  If you can take what happens in this game with a grain (or three) of salt, then you'll come out of it unscathed.  Otherwise, be prepared to lose some friends.  That's how nasty it *can* get.

I've only played the online version, but same deal.  In some ways amazing, but also majorly flawed imo. If you like this, play the online game "Triton: Neptune's Pride" which utilizes the diplomacy side of this, but also adds a RTS element.

RATING: 6
This game is pure negotation and requires players to work together initially knowing that they will be stabbed in the back eventually because initial cooperation and ultimate back stabbing is the only way to win. 

I've only played it a few times and don't feel like I've yet wrapped my head around the important strategic elements.

It is the backstabbing that puts this game this high in my ratings.  I love games that invoke an element of strategy in which you've gotta backstab.  A game of purity. One of the best from AH.  A great game to teach beginning players. I would say buy this game only if you are looking for a game that can truly be cutthroat and last for several hours.  Also in this is the fact that you have the potential to be eliminated from the game early on, meaning you will need to play fillers while you wait for the game to end.

Great concept.  Not particularly to my tastes, but with carnage rules and a pleasant set of opponents, it goes up to about a [b][bgcolor=#cc99ff]&nbsp;5&nbsp;[/bgcolor][/b]
 for me.  With no strict time limit and/or unpleasant opponents (since player interaction is 94% of the game), my rating dips to [b][bgcolor=#ff3366] 2.5 [/bgcolor][/b].

This is my favorite game.  There is no luck in this game, totally up to the "political" skills of the player.  Most fun when played with a backstabbing group.  A totally honest group just makes this a game of math and probability and really boring.  It does take a while and is difficult to find enough players to make it fun.  We played it my dorm with weekly moves, it was a blast and made you paranoid all week!

You have to lie to win. That's a huge problem for me.
People who love this game try to compare it to chess and say there is no luck. This is a load of garbage.
People who love this game repeatedly claim people are in some way defective if they don't like this game. That is also a load of garbage.

RATING: 10
The classic game of negotiation and maneuver. Elegant mechanics keep the focus on the strategy and diplomacy. There's also a high incentive for aggressive moves, since a) "combat" usually doesn't lose you units, b) even peaceful borders can require a fair amount of bumping against each other, and c) small gains can translate into a significant strategic advantage. It's very cut-throat, though, and can be long compared to today's games. Online play solves this problem nicely.

Many say the game is about backstabbing, but primarily it's about building trust through moves on the board, cooperating to break down/fight off a common foe, and balance of power.

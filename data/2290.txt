decent game, but i'm not a fan of the big box production on the version i owned.  this is the sort of thing i'd love to play online or as some sort of table installation at a local bar or whatever.  you know, like the places that have chessboards drawn on the table so you can play while you eat lunch.

A great bluffing game. It feels very light, and has a high amount of luck, but it's short play time and it's high tension add to make a winner mix. There are better options now, but this little game is still fun for everyone!

RATING: 3
Well, it is blindingly easy to explain, so it does deserve points for that.  Unfortunately, I abhor it.  Pure bluffing/deduction game that manages to fill be with frustration, not fun, every single time it has hit the table, regardless of what the outcome was.  Stratego fills this role much better, if this type of game is your thing.  Not unplayable, but the fun content is questionable.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fun little bluffing game in the same general vein as Stratego.  Glowing ghosts add little to gameplay since you can't really see the dots when it's dark enough for the ghosts to glow.

Ghosts is a fun and light filler loaded with a pinch of bluff: it plays so easy and fast that you need more time to explain it than to actually play it. [i](November 2011)[/i]

RATING: 3
Probably one of the dumber games I've ever played, as the game is a complete crap shoot without having any aspects that make it any fun.  Move a ghost one space, capturing an opponents ghost if you land on it.

The ghosts are two different colors, but the colors of your opponents ghosts are a secret to you.  Likewise, you're the only one that can see the colors of your own ghosts.  Capture all of the opponents yellow ghosts, and you win.  Blue ones, and you lose.  You can also run a ghost out the other side of the board to win, but only a yellow one.

In the end, it's a bluffing game, but the kind of bluffing game where there's no way to tell if your opponent is bluffing or not.  In the end, it's a complete crap shoot, with the redeeming value that it will all be over in 2 minutes.

RATING: 6.5
This is a great, quick-playing abstract game with rules that take all of 30 seconds. My 5 year old loves it...yet two adult gamers will also find the cat and mouse aspects very enjoyable.

Sure, the crux of the game comes down to guesswork and trying to trick your opponent. There is considerable strategy in positioning. You can try to force your opponent to take gambles be either deliberately capturing or NOT capturing ghosts which could threaten to escape. 

One of my proudest 'daddy' moments was when my 5 year old tricked my sister-in-law (an adult) into capturing a "bad" ghost by pretending it was a "good" ghost trying to escape. He just came up with the sneaky bluff on his own, and pulled it off. He's going to be a tough opponent in the near future for a lot of stuff.

Simple enough for kids, but with more strategy than things like Geistertreppe.

My six year old deliberately lied to me about the strategy he was playing ~ and I fell for it.  I thought he was advertising his next move.

Anyhow - cool little game.

I found a sealed copy of the MB version at a thrift store for 4 bucks. I almost passed it up thinking it was probably stupid. Then came home and saw the ratings and was like wow I did good, but still had my doubts.

Well let me tell you. I am really glad that I didn't put it back. This is really a great little game. There are different paths to victory. A lot of trying to bluff your opponents and the game plays in like 5 minutes or so. What a terrific little filler this turned out to be.

After the first play my friend and I were like wow. That was pretty cool. Let's play again. We wound up playing 4 games and were both shocked at how fun it was.

Don't pass this by if you get the chance to pick it up cheap. This is a great game for everyone from children to gamers looking for a really quick and fun filler type game.

Oh and the ghost are pretty big and glow in the dark to. It was worth it just for the bits.

Very good if played quickly and as a series of games (i.e., best of 9).

The clever victory conditions distil the game down to a "rock-paper-scissors" mechanism, but that's not as bad as it might sound. There's still enough scope for bluffing and tactics to make it worth your while and by playing many games in a row, you begin to recognize your opponent's "style." The ability to read these tendencies elevates the game to a slightly higher level. But it does require playing speedily -- if you're agonizing over a turn, you're playing it "wrong." (A match of 9 games should take about 45 minutes.)

It’s been awhile since I last played this. I’m not sure the rating would hold as I’m much harsher with them these days. I only played the German edition, but I had fond memories, so I bought the recently released Asmodee edition.

When I play it again, I will come back and re comment, for now I’m downgrading its rating to a 6.0. A game I would like to play from time to time, but perhaps it is way too light for my current tastes.

At last I played the game again and, surprisingly, I really enjoyed it. When I read the rules it seemed impossible I would enjoy it but as simple as it is, it is very fun. 

The key aspect is the fast playtime. You can finish a game under 8 minutes BUT it has strategy, interesting decisions (basically which ghost to move but each movement can represent many things) and bluffing. It also has some luck but I think the game can be deeper than initially thought.

The game components of the Asmodee edition are great as is the art. Perhaps the game comes in an unnecessary big box, but for now at least I will keep it in my game collection and I want to play again soon.

After some consideration, I’m downgrading the game´s rating. I no longer have a desire to play the game again. It is very basic and light for us. I already sold my copy of the game.

Geister edition.  A simplified Stratego-type variant of bluffing and double-bluffing using good and bad l'il ghosts.  Deeper than it looks with regards to the games multiple victory conditions.  Quick & slick.  -Traded
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.9
A good game.  Almost a mix of Chess and Stratego in a way.  Chess in how the grid and movement of ghosts move (though all pieces move the same way) and Stratego in having your phantoms color being known only to you.  There's actually a fair amount of thought that goes into playing.  I enjoy this quite a bit.

It's one of these games that has the game length going for it. 15-20 minutes of playtime, tops, that's it.

Another hit by Alex Randolph.  This game is mainly bluff and daring and it can be a lot of fun trying to guess what your opponent is up to.  I like how quickly this game plays, and slightly prefer it over Xe queo! because of the cool ghost pieces.  In essence they are similar games.

ボードゲーム初心者でもすぐにできて楽しめるいいゲームだと思う。ルールも簡単、短時間で終了するので繰り返し遊べる。初めてでも、プレイ中にブラフをいろいろ考えるに集中できる点が素晴らしい。
最終的には購入したのだが、自作も可能。カメラのフィルムケースや乾電池でおばけの代わりを作ったら面白かった。
妻の駒をずばずば当てまくっていたら、妻は「もう二度とこのゲームはしない」と言って怒ってしまった。
久しぶりに７歳の子どもとプレイしても、ルールが簡単なので子供の方も迷いなく遊べる。子供としては、親をだましたり、親のだましを見抜くのが非常に面白く感じるらしい。二人専用のゲームという点がマイナスだが、我が家の定番ゲームとなっている。

Played the Rai-Net Japanese version which belongs to a student here on campus who was excited someone else wanted to play.  Typical Japanese game in double-think and bluffing being involved in being successful in winning the game in trying to make your opponent believe the tile s/he is in position to take is virus (bad) instead of a link (good).  Plays quickly.  Not one I plan to buy, but am happy to play from time to time.

Played only on BSW.  I really like this game a lot, but YINSH and StreetSoccer have kind of bumped it down on my list of games to play when I'm on BSW.  Still, a very fast, quite fun game of bluffing with just enough tactics to hold it together.

UPDATE: I recently played a session with Alexfrog, and it rekindlied my appreciation for this game!  Back up to 8 again.  

UPDATE: I'm starting to get played out a little on this after a lot of play, so I'm dropping my rating to 7.

UPDATE: dropping to a 6, although I suspect playing this with the right person could bump it back up again.

This is a fun and FAST game for two players.  A great game for kids (ultra-simple rules) but also very useful for two players who want to kill some time while waiting for a larger game to start.

RATING: 10
There's no better example of how an author can improve a game than Geister. Alex Randolph's Evade was already a very nifty tactical game, short and stripped-down but ridiculously addictive; nevertheless, by expanding the board, adding two more pieces per player, marginally restricting their movement and offering an alternative way to win the leap forward in Geister is so huge that it feels almost like a different game, not as vicious but way more filling: the tactical riddles are more complex and varied, bluffs are not as risky at first so that the play can start off nice and nasty, and it's easier as well to prepare a win through pure skill. 

The usual "less is more" lemma concerning Alex Randolph's games doesn't entirely apply for Geister: here adding a bit more turns a fantastic game into an unforgettable one.

RATING: 6
A deceptively simple game, Jekyll & Hyde (or Ghosts) is like Stratego Super-lite. Both players move their pawns across the board, both movement and "combat" is resolved by the same rules, just move sideways, fore- or backwards. Both players have to take out the four "correct" pawns of the enemy, while preventing from having your own takes. The crucial thing is however, that the other players cannot tell which of your eight pawns are the one he is supposed to catch. Thus, there is a lot of bluffing going on, luring the opponent into attacking the wrong pawns etc. A great and quick game. HX

Quite a good light bluffing game, in the mould of Stratego but much simpler.  Works well with kids because their random play makes them difficult for (this) adult to read.  The downside is that because it is so fast, there is a temptation to take a risk and blow the game rather than take a more patient approach.

Very good (2 player only) kids game with an elegant design and cool bits (that are unlikely to be swallowed or destroyed by little sibs).  It's a streamlined version of Stratego (ghosts are good or bad, no point values) with an emphasis on bluffing rather than memory.  Nice intro to bluffing and to multiple victory conditions.

Fantastic two player filler. Each player has four good ghosts and four bad; you win if the enemy captures your bad ghosts, you capture their good ghosts, or move a good ghost off the board.

Hardly any rules, but a brilliantly dynamic experience of bluff, feint, and deduction that gets better the more you play.

If only the box and board were smaller!

[Drei Magier 'guten und die bösen Geister, Die' 2001 edition] {Horror, kid, couple, filler; stratego-variant} Ghost! is a short, simple and interesting game. One can make an intrigue to lure your opponent to catch your bad ghosts. It's exciting when you have caught 3 bad ghosts of your opponent. It's also funny when you found that you guess wrongly and let your opponent go through the corner easily.

The ghosts are cute but the game is quite expensive. (Actually, most Drei Magic games are expensive) The only problem is that ghost figures are too light and can easily be knocked down or shifted.

This was a very simple Stratego-like game of hidden movement and bluffing.  It's a great game for kids, and while some people would say the same for adults, I disagree.  It's too simple for adults to enjoy.

Real fun to play with my stephson. Although five years old, he grasps (and love) the idea of tricking me where his pieces are.

Also a future investment in a come-to-be gaming buddy since I have so few nerdy friends. :(

RATING: 6
Almost entirely luck based and will often come down to a 50-50 guess as to whether you win or lose. The ability to gain information is severely limited as the board is so small, but this is honestly kinda fun for a simple filler. Perhaps shows its age more than a little, but I'm willing to cut it some slack...

Duchy is a simple, basically children game, about good versus evil fight. Every player has both good and evil ghosts in his team at the beginning. His task is to either run away with one of the good guys or to force an enemy to capture all his evil spirits. Ghosts attack each other and make the defender into prisoner. But when you attack ghost, you never know, if it is good or bad. It has no influence on the attack outcome, but you can lose a battle, if you capture last evil ghost of an enemy. This makes game tense, but also a lot random. You would not be able to find figure positions for hex side of the board and on larger space, there is also bigger chance for ghosts to run and chase each other. This could be solved with other victory condition, escaping with a good ghost. Duchy will catch your children eye with interesting processing and simplicity..

It's a good two player game, but I suggest you play it at least three times in a row with the same opponent, so the bluff and double-bluff factor of the game can really shine.

This is a pretty pure bluffing game and I don't really like that. The ghost-to-the-opponents-corner bit adds a little strategy, but not enough for me.

Ghosts! is what you get if you take Stratego and make it less complicated while keeping the depth.  It's an abstract two player that plays super quick.  Basically you have eight ghosts with hidden color markers, four blue and four yellow.  Your goal is to get a blue ghost to the opponent's back rank without taking all four of your opponents yellow ghosts.  Whenever you attack an opponent's ghost you take it without revealing what your ghost is.  Simple, yet requires strategy and there's a big bluffing game here as well.

Beautiful and ellegant light game. Ups: 5min to play. 3 ways to win. Great bluffing experience. Funny! Downs: A bit repetitive after 20-30 plays. Not really tactical play, nearly all is bluffing.

Used to play this game when I was a kid.  It's like a simplistic game of Stratego.  I recently unearthed it from my parents basement. 

I have an extra board for this game.  Don't ask me how.

Light filler with rules that can be explained in 20 seconds (even to a 5 year old, so it appeared). Games generally play in 15 - 20 minutes, which is perfect for a game this light. Game is very suitable for nongamers and players prone to analysis paralysis, as bluffing and guessing are its most important ingredients. Nevertheless, some tactical insight is still required! Got the Drie Magier Spiele edition, which is plain lovely to look at.

Old game from the 80ies, like a simplified Stratego with just two different pieces. Bluffing all around.

Like most Randolph games, this is one of pure bluff and double-bluff, stripped down to its barest of essences.  Whether or not this is the best of his designs will take some more plays, but my first impressions are good.

I will probably always hold onto this because it was a game from my childhood, but there's not a lot to it.  It does, however, have glow-in-the-dark ghost figures.  How cool is that?

Showed it to my 4 year old daughter. She liked it but tired quickly - I think it was too advanced for her, I'll try again in another 6 month or a year.

The rating is for playing with her. Still playable but not great with adults, I'd give it probably a 5 in that case.

Wasn't expecting much but was pleasantly surprised.  One of the best MB games I've ever seen.  I'm not sure there is a lot of 2nd and 3rd level thinking going on for most people playing this game (me included), but it is good for a few funny moments at the very least.

A simple, fast game that always calls for one more playing every time.  Making spooky, taunting ghostly sound effects when your opponent captures your pieces adds to the giggle factor. We don't use pink pegs in our game for the colorblind player since it's easier to differentiate pegged vs. unpegged ghosts.

This filler is a nice bluffing, strategy game. The solid gameplay has remained untarnished by the twenty seven years since this was made.
Howls and laughter usually come hand-in-hand during sessions of this little gem. Frustration can also be a factor against newbies, if you are good at this type of thing!

I have the Rai-Net Access Battlers game. It's based off the original Ghosts! but has a bit more to it.

I like it,because it is very hard in difficulty deck building cooperative game and you must try to think a lot of our movements with the teammates. The most times we won it and with great difficult sometimes.I recommend it a lot to people who wants to play cooperatives games in hard and very hard mode.

Quite an interesting deck builder here, although the deck building part itself is a little slower than other co-op games. I really enjoyed the Taunt mechanics and how you approach each location's monsters, what with a Defending player each round that will be the center focus while other players assist them. Some might be turned off by the dice mechanic that some of the heroes have, but you can always mitigate that with the others who do a static amount. Art and components are solid, I'm hoping they can one day expand it with more heroes from the Red Dragon Inn universe.

Even when losing (which will happen often), I find this game incredibly enjoyable. It takes a bit to teach to others, but it has a great flow once everyone is used to the way things go.

I really like the game, but it is hard.  In fact, it is so hard that the difficulty impacts my enjoyment of the game.  That said, I still like the game, and I will play it from time to time as a fun solo experience.  I do think that Aeons End is a better game, though I am happy that I have both in my collection.

I really want to like this more than I do so far- may update in the future. The plays we've done have all been grueling slogs and were not enjoyable. It's cooperative yes, but overall it really feels like you're never able to do enough on your turn. Never enough shields or taunts available, and the mechanic of everyone playing cards on your turn means people will inevitably run out of cards, or have few options available as the game continues. With no way to recover health at all, if you get unlucky early in, you can end up just screwed later on, leading to a frustrating and unenjoyable game. Apparently to have the best chance of beating some of the missions you have to play as specific characters, something you're apparently supposed to just figure out. Seems to me if you need to have certain characters, or shouldn't bring others, then the scenario should give recommendations. Overall, haven't had a good experience with it; even when we won, I didn't actually have fun while playing it.

Tentative rating.

Vanilla RDI is a fun game, but not one I would point to if given options for a game night.  It might be something of an opener or a closer, but never the reason you get together (imho).  So it's no surprise that Greyport flew way under the radar for me and ended up on the table via my girlfriend, so we gave it a shot.

As far as design goes, it's solid.  There were very few ambiguities in the ruleset and those were immediately cleared up with the revised rulebook online.  Each player will have their starting hand, like in any deckbuilder, which contains people or items/weapons.  Generally, you get to only play one person (your player character also counts) and one item on that person and then you fight randomly-drawn monsters that are placed either in front of you or in the location.  The location card itself determines what special rules are in place and how to set up the current encounter.  The whole point is that monsters at the location will constantly chip away at its health while players need to fend off their own monsters in order to get to the ones attacking the location.  Obviously, if the location "dies", then the players lose.  Things are made a little easier should the luck of the market draw (a shuffled deck as opposed to Dominion's pick-and-choose style of market) serve you, but your money is limited by the location setup and so far, I haven't seen a way of getting any richer.

In terms of how engaged I was for this game, it varies.  Thematically, this game does little for me.  We've seen it all before.  It was described to me as Fantasy Sentinels of the Multiverse (a somewhat valid, if loose comparison) and like I said, the design is solid and it works.  It didn't really get exciting until we were really really close to losing (which is a state that's pretty easy to reach) and just working out card combos in order to trudge forward without dying.  Even still, the game didn't speak to me.

I don't think it's bad by any means, but it certainly didn't knock my socks off.  It just felt like I've played this before, even though I haven't, and to me, that suggests it didn't really bring much to the table.  It's a variant of stuff we've seen before.

All that being said, there's fun to be had here and if you're not already neck-deep in the hobby, this is a great place to start.

Once I get my hands on a full campaign, I will likely revise my findings/rating.

RATING: 3
Battle For Greyport is a brutally-difficult game that's on the verge of impossible to win. It may be that the "introductory" scenario is just poorly tuned and that other scenarios do better, but perusing the game's numbers doesn't seem to give me hope that it's much easier.

It's a real shame, too. The heros are fun, the effects are fun, the artwork is nice, the components are solid, the gameplay is interesting, and you get to do cool role-playing game kinds of things. You have to decide what monsters to taunt, whether you should use your big items to blow away a group, decide what items to buy, and so forth. It really feels like you're doing a World of Warcraft raid boss... except your raid group came in wearing starter gear and didn't quite level up enough.

RATING: 10
Amazing coop/solo card game with deck building elements. 
It mixes beloved mechanisms from games like "Warhammer Quest ACG", "Sentinels of the multiverse" and "Thunderstone" and also incorporates some new and interesting ideas.
The gameplay is very intense, every decision matters and there is a very rewarding escalation of power in the new cards you buy as well as in the enemies strength. The level of interaction/cooperation between the players is very high, compared to other "coop" games. 
The game got a little flack when it first came out because it was too hard. Now, with the rulebook 1.1, there is a healing step between each encounter which balances the game quite nicely. It is still very challenging now but not insurmountable, which i enjoy immensely. The art design of the card borders could have been better but otherwise the component quality is very high (great tokens, custom dice, oversized location cards etc.). 
I hope this game will acquire a more wider renown which it surely deserves. I am looking forward to possible expansions!!

I feel the game is was too hard to defeat (even with latest rules version). It's a cooperative game, and traditionally they are difficult, but after losing a game, I think of actions I would do differently and I may have won, but at the end of this game I have no ideas what to do differently to win next game.  I'm hoping an expansion changes this. I really do enjoy playing this game and the mechanics.

Different scenarios (target different bosses in stage 3).
Monsters assigned to location or heroes.
Pull monsters away from town/other players to help them (at your own risk...)
Play cards to attack your monsters, except special effects to attack further monsters.
Buy loot / helpers from the town, add to deck.

Thinky, a bit difficult on normal difficulty (try easy first!)

'Intro' level is super fucking hard, to the point of frustration.  Skip that and go to the first level it is enjoyable.  The main issue I have with this game is that there isn't room for error, you have to pull on every turn minus one or you lose. There really is only one strategy and if you dont execute it to a t you lose.

Fast gameplay, even in a learning game.  For how much it comes with and the number of players, it's surprisingly simple.  Component quality is fantastic and there is an extremely functional insert.  There's room for expansions, but current components don't slide around or get jumbled.  Needed some sandwich bags to keep tokens separate, but that's it.

I liked a lot about this game. It was a great twist that you had to buy a card every turn, and you could only buy one card. I also liked that weapons were useless unless they had someone to carry them, and that you had to match weapons to the right heroes and each hero could only carry a certain number of weapons. 

The implementation for two player was flawed though. You were able to use your super-powerful character card so often that it seemed to unbalance the game. The other hero cards were less valuable than they otherwise should have been. This wouldn't be a problem if you played with more people.

Good: 
Artwork is of the same quality as the Red Dragon Inn series. 

Card quality is good. 

Winning a game is a challenge.

Scenarios scale in difficulty.  

Bad: 
You work with the other players to whittle down foes, but there wasn't much team synergy or combos. 

The characters are unbalanced. The wizard was the most useful character of the group we selected because he could do AoE damage. 

This doesn't have the whimsical feel of the Red Dragon Inn series. 

Equipment and spells are pretty lackluster. So when it comes time to purchase gear there isn't any tough choices but more of a "meh' I guess I will take that one to help build a combo".

Really liked this when I tried the print and play, then I was just disappointed. It was such a seemingly cool game and I wanted to enjoy it, but it just doesn't work. It's pretty much impossible to win and it just ends up being a struggle to stay alive for all players. Just not fun.

Really uninspired game that claims to be both a deck builder and a cooperative game, but doesn't really feel like either. I'll give them this: it's better than the Red Dragon Inn stuff, but that's not really saying much. This is simply a game of playing cards to attack other cards, with some dice rolling thrown in to keep the RDI audience from thinking this is too serious of a game. Even though I wasn't that big of a fan, Aeon's End recently came out, and it makes this game look like a half-baked imitator of other deck builders in comparison.

Great game and great production (although the insert could have been more refined and the rules clearer...). However, don't let the light Red Dragon Inn theme fool you: this is a brutally hard coop game... which may become doable once your judgment and anticipation has improved (although you'll still need luck). Inexperienced coop players may want stay away from this title; otherwise, you're heading for an ego-shattering experience. I'd rate this game higher if the designers had been more mindful of the casual players and provided a better scaling of difficulty. This game will appeal more to the "Mistfall" player niche. This being said, don't get me wrong: the game is great!

Ok, so this game is hard, but i LOVE that. This makes me work for my wins, and the challenge is enjoyable. 

Make no mistake, this is not you easy-peasy RDI experience, it's connected to that happy-go-lucky game by name and graphics only. This game will try it's damnedest to kick your ass, and will probably succeed a time or two.

Spoiler alert - this is how you win -

One for all and all for one. When everybody goes above and beyond to save their friends, at the cost of their own safety. then you will all triumph. ;)

I thought this game was going to be a fantasy themed version of Sentinels of the Multiverse.  It's got a similar concept - you use a character with a deck, you have a location, there are enemies that you must defeat.  That's as far as the analogy goes.

It's definitely very different than SotM.  I love SotM, but my wife finds it too fiddly with all the rules and chits and such.  She loves this game - and so do I.  It's challenging and offers amazing variation in scenarios.  You must be very strategic and work together well if you want to have any chance of winning.

I've seen some people complaining that his game is too hard.  I haven't found that to be the case.  It's a cooperative game, and traditionally they are difficult.  In my experience, cooperative games usually have about a 40% chance of winning.  If you are put off by losing that much then cooperative games are probably not for you.

After having played this game several times I've found it far better with more heroes.  Playing 4 or 5 heroes is much better than 2.  Obviously it's nice to have 4 or 5 players too...but if you solo the game or play with 2 players I'd recommend controlling 4 or 5 heroes.

Brutally unforgiving cooperative multiplayer with some strange balance issues. The introductory and easy quests are apparently harder than the medium ones, meaning that anyone starting with the recommended "beginner" quests is in for a rude awakening.

That said, the theme of the game is great. It has great art, and the actual mechanics of recruiting heroes and items is really interesting.

But overall, Sentinels of the Universe feels much more balanced (and much more winnable), and really gives you more opportunities to feel like you're helping the team. In Greyport, you'll spend most 4-player games starved for cards and unable to do anything but throw dinky 1-damaage acolytes around.

The game is fun if you like boss killing games.  It is also challenging.  They have updated the rules so be sure to play your first few games with "Rest Healing 2" as suggested.  The tutorial game isn't really a tutorial and it's actually easier to play the other "easy" boss.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A decent adventure-sim deckbuilder, this game is a lot of fun in places but also stumbles quite a bit in others. The game falls into the all-too common flaw of deckbuilders where if you lose, it will either be early in the game, or largely because of damage you TOOK early in the game, because challenges start out as absurdly hard, then become laughably easy as your deck improves. This is true even using the errata rules easily found on line granting healing between missions (which you need to... game borders on impossible otherwise). It can also feel a bit clunky, unthemed, and dull IMO, which is surprising given how much flair and personality Red Dragon Inn had.

At the moment, this game fills a niche that is basically unique alongside Clank, so I don't regret buying it or see myself parting with it any time soon since it's the best thing to scratch that itch... I also don't see myself taking it off the shelf much compared to other titles in my collection though, even if I keep my catalogue small.

Battle for Greyport takes place in the same world as the Red Dragon Inn games, but is a completely different game. Whereas RDI is a competitive, take-that card game, Battle for Greyport is a cooperative deckbuilder. I remember when BfG was on Kickstarter, I saw it and immediately thought it was just another expansion for RDI. I think many people also had and continue to have this misconception, which is a shame because BfG is really an excellent co-op game.

BfG has similarities to Shadowrun: Crossfire and Warhammer Quest: the Adventure Card Game, but I actually like it better than both of those. I like how all the players are actively involved, no matter who is considered the Defending player. I enjoy how the characters each feel a bit different with their own strengths and weaknesses. The encounter system works well (allowing players to level up each time they complete an encounter) and the scaling of player counts seems sound. BfG got a bit of a bad rap because some people felt the game was too difficult, but Slugfest has provided some small tweaking that adds in healing between encounters as well as a more gentle introductory scenario. I highly recommend downloading the updated rules if you give this one a try. I initially put it on my wishlist after hearing people talk about how it was such a hidden gem (and overlooked because people assumed it was another expansion for RDI). I’m very glad I wishlisted it (and my friend decided to gift it to me as a birthday present) because this game is extremely solid. I hear there is an expansion in the works and I’m very excited to see what it has in store. Great co-op deckbuilder that I highly recommend.

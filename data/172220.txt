Day after day, I grew to enjoy this game and the material more. What better is when combining all the games from this system along with self created content and modified rules. The system provided such a good platform for creative gaming.

RATING: 6
I was surprised how well such a simple dungeon slayer could work. And as a matter of fact, I started to think that this is close to the optimal level of streamlining. The game moves fast because you are not spending time on looking for the right pieces or information on reference sheets. Moreover, there is no need for a dungeon master which is a huge bonus for the owner of the game (who in my experience is almost always forced to assume that role).

Of course this simplification is a trade-off with depth, but in my opinion it's a justified one. Now everything moves really fast and the game is action packed. I'd definitely play again.

This game also marks a milestone in my hobby being the 500th rated game.

RATING: 7
The gameplay has been tweaked so that a combination of both enemies and encounters are not as commonly dealt with on player turns. Traps can now be avoided altogether or disarmed. The difficulty of the game has not diminished because of these changes.

Temple is a great step for the D&D Adventure System.  The campaign mode makes it so I can't wait to get back to this game for another session.  The more random monster generation  breaks up the "move-fight-flip" repetitiveness found in much of the rest of the series.  Gambling on a trap token (also new to the system) makes for some fun moments, as well.

Wow, love the new updated rules and game play. I think this tops Ravenloft.

Managed to play and found the combat hard with less than a full party. Excellent addition to the System. Looking to incorporate the Campaign rules into the other three.

RATING: 8.5
While Ravenloft and Drizzt might have a little more personality to them, Temple of Elemental Evil has swiftly become the best of the D&D Adventure Board Games due to some of the newly included mechanics. There's an advantage/disadvantage rule now from 5th edition D&D, and also a much better advancement system. Once you've hit level 2 you can then spend Gold to purchase upgrade tokens in Town. And that's another thing, Town Phases! And there are also some Town adventures and tiles. Good times, but otherwise it's extremely similar to the other three games in the line, and even the new rules are compatible with them.

RATING: 4
Snoozefest.  Takes out the only fun part of D&D, the role-play, and leaves the boring mechanics.  Random weird athematic unexplained event/encounters thrown in on top of a terribly thin storyline make this one just awful.

WOTC has finally got the D&D boardgame thing right! I really liked the other 3 games (especially Drizzt), but wow, this one just feels right. The balance is spot on. Heroes are powerful, but more monsters come out. The trap mechanism introduces a nice push your luck aspect as well. The Campaign mode (3 adventures in) is a blast! Being able to get better as the game goes on, AND have the game get more difficult, is so cool. I really like how the characters not in the adventure get money as well as I play solo 3 player and like to swap out characters. I hope Wizards continues to make these as I will be a loyal customer if they are as good as this!

RATING: 8
For being at a point in my life now where getting together with a group of people for a 2-4 hour DnD sesh is just not possible, this is a nice little alternative.  It probably isn't the best dungeon crawler out there, but it is a simplefied version of one that, for me anyway, scratches the DnD experience itch.  I can play it by myself (sad) or with a buddy who's just as busy as I am (not as sad).  I am looking forward to seeing what kind of creative ways I can combine the Elemental Evil set with the Legend of Drizzt set.  I've also found an alternitive passion for painting minis...badly, but I'm having fun and that is what counts.

RATING: 6
Dungeon and Dragon themed board game. The board is split into tiles. As you advance your character to the edge of the current tile, the next tile is chosen at random and expands the current board. Each tile dictates what events and monsters occur in that tile. The game comes with a significant amount of figures. I found some of them to be rather fragile. This game also takes a significant amount of time to set up and take down. There is no exp to level your character. Instead you have to spend gold that you get by defeating monsters. This game can also be combined with other sets of similar nature.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
With the new additions, it really feels like a DM-less session. These improvements make the game better:traps make sense now, an actual campaign mode, variable amount of monsters per room. Now, how can we add these improvements to the earlier games? Great entry!

Need to play this in a campaign setting but it plays like the other DnD adventure games with new heroes and LOTS of traps to either disarm or move past.  Monsters are beefier in this set and the leveling happens as part of the adventure instead of when you crit.  Definitely an enjoyable game.

This is an outstanding game based on 4th edition D&D. It plays well, the threat level is managed so it's always exciting and never overwhelming. Definitely works better as a board game than a RPG (not a fan of 4th Ed D&D as a RPG).

RATING: 6
-traded away in a MathTrade-

I really really like this game a lot.
First, I come from a DnD-PnP-RPG background and have played the "Temple of Elemental Evil" in PnP and as a PC-Game.
Secondly, I love Dungeon Crawls.
Thirdly, I love Co-Op games.

...and with this gane I get everything in a well structured rule-set, with well functioning mechanics. I appreciate it when there is (the possibility of) an automated overlord. This game, like the Co-Op-expansion from Descent, does it really really good.
It was the first game I played solo (just to test it) but it pulled me so much into the game...I don't have words for this.

Great game.

Components are also very well made. There could be more different miniatures but that is okay, since you could combine it with the rest of the DnD-series. (...and my Firebats were broken when I got them...but that's nothing glue can't fix)
The cards are a bit thin but the cardboard is very sturdy.

I can truly recommend this.

Now that some time has passed the randomness bothers me quite a bit. Draw the wrong card, fail to disable a trap - boom - you're done, and there is nothing you can do about it.

RATING: 6.5
Played this in a group of 5, all of us fairly new to it. Overall I definitely liked it, but it had one specific mechanic that wasn't to my taste and puts me off:
- Encounter cards felt a little frustrating. They frequently took out a quarter of a player's HP and you generally ended up drawing them almost every turn. I think the lack of interaction or control over this element (which was where the vast majority of the difficulty came from) felt somewhat "cheap". I would have preferred more monsters and tougher monsters to increase the difficulty.

Other comments (neutral & positive):
- A fair bit of down time. A lot of this was the fact we were new players, but later on it was a good thing. We'd be discussing tactical choices for how to make it out by the skin of our teeth. The good kind of downtime!
- Nice miniatures
- Nice mix of character skills, some of them complementary. Really got you working together.

For some reason, this one seemed a lot cleaner than the other DnD board games.  I'm not sure if they actually improved it, or I'm just getting more used to how these games play.  I am a little disappointed that the figures are unpainted, but since they are roughly available through the miniatures boosters, I should be able to upgrade the game with those.

What a fantastic game. I have played D&D tabletop for about 10 years now since I was 17 and I always loved the immersion you could get from a good DM but I understood the problem people have with the amount of time it takes to do it. However this game definitely scratches that itch. It lets you crawl through a dungeon and come out the other side feeling you actually accomplished something. It's not D&D in a box, but its damn close if you have the right group. The mechanics are superb, the pieces are fantastically well crafted, and the campaign system is great. I highly recommend it. 

Edit: After playing this more I can say it's about a 7. Good game but not great. The thing that bugs me, ironically, are the outdoor missions.

Improves upon earlier editions by adding campaign option.
BEST FEATURE
Many beautiful components: unpainted miniatures, interlocking dungeon tiles, & other tokens. Also the interface with previous editions is seamless.
WORST FEATURE
Game gets a little bland after many replays. Cooperative dungeon crawl is not everyone's cup of tea.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Very tentative rating.

I am an old time D&D player, but I haven't played the main system since AD&D 2nd Edition (aka: the stone age). Lately I have been getting co-ops to play with my gf though, and this game was part of that, as it has the campaign feature that we are looking for.

By and large ToEE is a pretty basic explore, hack and slash affair. There aren't a lot of terribly complex decisions, and the game has a healthy dose of randomness due to the way the tiles, monster cards, and encounter deck are stacked. That said, it is a pretty effective dungeon crawling experience and one that we are both enjoying for the time being. It also has the virtue of not overstaying its welcome, as it plays in about an hour or so, which is perfect for the complexity level.

There aren't enough decisions here to really make me want to play it heavily, but it's a good little experience game that I know we will get through the complete campaign when it's all said and done.

Also: A on the components, very nice tiles and great mini sculpts.

Aside: we use line of sight house rules for ranged attacks. It just feels odd to play the game any other way to us.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Really satisfying co-operative campaign. The components are top notch with tonnes of minis and nice thick cardboard.
Had a great time playing this with my D&D group when we couldn't get an actual game going.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Played through half the campaign so far, and while it is definitely a fun game it is not without its flaws.  There simply needs to be more customization of your character either through gained abilities or through unique items from the item deck.  With just a a few changes / upgrades to that the staying power could last the 12 missions, but without it it sits on my shelf half finished.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.9
Wow!  To preface my comments, I love co-ops and I love D&D. I also really liked the first three games in the system, but they were missing something - a campaign mode. This game nails it. Theme - great linkage to the Princes of the Apocalypse D&D campaign. Campaign mode seems exactly what I'm looking for in that after you hit second level you can still enhance your character. The game can still be brutal with the Encounters, but you seem to be able to gain enough space to avoid the worst. The will put Descent down further on my gaming list. I love this game!  Number two in my collection!

This is my least favourite among the D&D adventure system boardgames. It adds the unnecessary level of complexity of campaign play that I enjoyed NOT being in the other games. However I can see that it adds a great element for those who want it. Also, it is the least interchangeable with the others. As with the others quality of the components is good but the rules are still too ambiguous.

I've got enough plays of this under my belt now to say that I really enjoy it. Some people say that luck plays into it too much and that it can be swingy, but I think that's just part of the fun. It's also just a matter of fact with a game with so many random factors. When you've got random map layout, random traps, random monsters, random events, and random treasure, it's impossible to have it balanced for every single situation. But it sure makes for a good time!

RATING: 8
Good game. Like all coop games, a fair amount of setup and work between turns, but fun. On successive plays, I've increased the rating slightly (and setup doesn't take as long).

Why did they put the temple in Faerun? Forgotten Realms sucks. The pantheon has the depth and complexity of He-Man. Terrible design choice. No Hommlet? No Tharizdun or Iuz? It's like they wanted to intentionally ruin it.

Still, try to pretend the town is Hommlet and the cards are Greyhawk characters, and you're back to enjoying it.

Played once solo and once with two players.

While the box represents great value, the game just isn't that exciting so far. Both plays resulted in a bad loss on the very first quest. The monsters and combat are fine (a bit repetitive) but the constant assault of random, unavoidable damage coming at you from the encounter cards is just frustrating! Possibly more players would help, but that would just mean more encounters anyway.

I'm really hoping to get something more out of this one, so will attempt to round up more players and hopefully we'll see some more variety later into the campaign... If not, I may have a go at doing up some rules for a skirmish type variant using all the dungeon tiles as a battleground, with multiple heroes in charge of squads of monsters etc.

Okay, I'm a huge fan of D&D 3.5 edition, despite its many flaws ... D&D 5e has returned to its roots while 4e was utter failure, in my opinion. That said, the D&D board games are [i]exactly[/i] what 4e should've been all along!

I've always loved the Dungeons & Dragons board games. They bring flavor and dungeon crawling to the table in an easily digestible package. For a while, however, they ended up taking the back seat to other games in my collection (or on my wish list) since I did not get to play them as often as I would like. But then I started playing these games more and more with my kids and their glory returned to the table once more!

These games are interesting, challenging, and captivating, whether you win or lose. I love how this game revisits the old adventure classic!

RATING: 7.5
A light to medium campaign style dungeon crawl. Some great miniatures in here. Easy to learn and play. One of the big pros here is that you don't need a DM (as in Descent) because the game itself controls the opposing villains and monsters, so everyone can play. However, this does mean the enemy actions and attacks lack the variety that comes with a DM controlling them.

RATING: 7
Co-op dungeon crawler with no DM and a light campaign. The rules are fairly accessible but don't cover every situation. Luckily I could find the answers in BGG.
The light progression aspect and adventure is great and it really motivates you to keep coming back.

As the campaign progresses some parts are becoming grating. The first is some of the rules are quite loose, like the concept of line of sight. The second, more pressing, is that the game punishes you for not moving forward. You explore because you don't want to draw Encounter Cards, but it's very likely that you will have to anyway. As a result I feel like most levels are more of a race than a dungeon crawl.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fast-paced, simplistic dungeon crawl with nice looking components.  The campaign rules add a grand new dimension to the game. Players have more invested in the characters and decision-making can have more effect on the overall campaign. I like the simplistic way that trap tokens were integrated into the map. I like the simplistic way in which the campaign gains difficulty and characters advance. I don't, however, like the reward for failure: keep all cash and treasure and try again. As with the sister games, some rule details are poorly explained which leads to confusion. In the end, the campaign system adds much-needed depth to the game, but it is still limited to light play. With that fact stated, the game does fit the niche well. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Lots and lots of small pieces to this game. Wizards of the Coast needs to consider a better way to allow owners to accommodate the pieces of ToEE. Two large trays on the insert are just not helpful. There has to be a better way. 

I had to contact Wizards of the Coast to get a stand for the black dragon, but that was no problem and they shipped it quickly. 

With all of that said, I like ToEE board game a lot. It's fast and fun. Brings the D&D theme to life and is very easy to learn and teach. I took it a bit further and got the painted Icons of the Realms minis and all of the monster minis from WizKids boosters to in place of the solid blue or green minis in the ToEE. Makes game play a bit more thematic. Certainly not even remotely necessary. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
This game has very limited lifespan. It is only a shadow of what the real Temple of Elemental Evil is. The mechanics are too simple. It is way too expensive for such a game, you only pay for the miniatures, the game is not worth much. I prefer playing Warhammer Quest the board game, it is a much more rewarding experience for fans of games like this, it is also replayable for hundreds of games. Also, you can keep your characters if they survive from game to game as well as their gear and experience unlike ToEE which is just a one hour game that you might play twice just to see if the new game will be different from the other.

Don't buy unless you want a bunch of miniatures. The game is really not worth anybody's time.

A missed opportunity for the 4th time. The rules have pretty much stood still since Ravenloft. Every release is another chance gone by to develop this into a more sophisticated system. Even just un-generic some tiles. Anything! It wouldn't take a lot. Just do something, pretend you are trying, a bit of new photoshopping, a new deck. Some extra character levelling. Monster levelling. Any fucking thing!

As it is, the adventure game system, hangs on the edge of greatness, and it appears there it will stagnantly remain due to laziness from WoTC. Just another box of unpainted Wiz Kids minis and a near photocopied Ravenloft rule book. Yawn.

Bring forth the holy grail damn you! The mythical official: combine all sets into a giant campaign rule set! Make these titles worth buying!

Played it three times as a campaign. So far I like the changes a lot. Traps, campaign mode, ability to sell off unwanted treasures to buy level ups and additional once per adventure powers is a welcome addition. I felt that the series was getting stale, and although the theme of the last one (Drizzt) was really nice and fun to play in the Drow verse, it seemed like it overstayed its welcome and the challenge curve had dropped considerably since the original Ravenloft (Drizzt's abilities were overpowered). The challenge should go up as the series progresses, not down, as people become acclimated to the system and can fully take advantage of it.

In ToEE, the challenge level was reset (for 3 adventurers) and we felt like we were very close to disaster but pulled it out each time. The addition of town tiles provides a different experience there every so often which is interesting and opens up possibilities. I think this game is a good compromise for those that don't want a Descent style experience where a GM is required, or who seek a fully co-op experience, ala Mice & Mystics. It carves out its own niche quite well and has caught up to modern co-op adventure games.

I can't see playing this game (or the others) as stand alone adventures. It really, imo, requires a campaign element where the challenge is upped as the adventurers progress. I don't know how I feel about the other three games at this point because we've played almost every adventure in them. Not sure if this "fires" those games but I will probably update this review after completing the campaign (13 adventures).

RATING: 7.5
Simple dungeon crawler based on the temple of elemental evil storyline.

Sometimes gets pretty hectic as it feels like there's very little time to breathe between encounters and stuff is being thrown at you constantly.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Playing through the campaign is definitely fun. Unfortunately, it's way too easy, though. Except for the first mission I beat every scenario in my first try without spending a single healing surge.
Also, the new way traps work is a step backwards. They hardly ever matter in any way.

Let's hope the Tomb of Annihilation is more challenging.

In the Dungeons & Dragons: Temple of Elemental Evil Board Game, you play as a heroic adventurer. With amazing abilities, spells and magic weapons, you must explore the dungeons beneath the Sword Coast where you will fight monsters, overcome hazards and find treasure. Are you ready for adventure?

Temple of Elemental Evil includes multiple scenarios, challenging quests, and co-operative game play designed for 1-5 players. The contents can also be combined with other D&D Adventure System Cooperative play board games, including The Legend of Drizzt and Castle Ravenloft.

This takes me back to my youth.  Pretty simple mechanics.  Good fun dungeon crawler but with some great co-operative elements.  Great components and great design.

This introduced my kids to the world of D&D and they loved it.  Love the monsters.  Love the characters.  Doubt I would pick up the others now I own this though as I feel it might all be a bit too repetitive.  One box is enough for me I think.

Seriously underwhelmed with a first play through. Got bored about 30 minutes in when I realized I'd be doing the same thing over and over again - the game is just prolonged for no reason whatsoever. Totally  monotonous. You either flip a tile and fight some monsters, take damage from an encounter, or take damage from an encounter and fight a monster. Its the same shit over and over. Miniatures are great. But for a dungeon crawl Level 7 Omega Protocol is way better (yes that requires an overseer).

I have made it through Adventure 7 and have really enjoyed this game. My 8 year old son and I have played the whole way through. Like many games it was initially hard to absorb all the rules, but once over the hump you can cruise through the steps very quickly and easily. It has been quite possibly the most fun I have had playing games with my son. The co-op aspect and the leveling up have made it a perfectly enjoyable experience.

I don't like: Played first 9 missions and nothing surprises me - quite similar. Elementalhumans are boring enemies. Did not like townmissions either. And also: feeling quite stupid when you don't draw a dungeontile you must draw and usually get big encounter - takes more damage than bigger monsters.

[b]D&D: Temple of Elemental Evil Board Game [/b]

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (6 -> 6)[/COLOR]

[i]This is my son's game that he will occasionally solo when he can't get his D&D role playing fix. This is the second in the series we've played, Drizzt being the other, and I prefer the improvements made in this version that I outlined last year. Unfortunately this still isn't the type of game I am clamoring to play, but if my son requests it I will happily play. If you are looking for a great gateway into dungeon crawls I think Temple of Elemental Evil is a great starting point. The rules aren't very difficult, the monster AI works well and outfitting your character with spells and abilities may be the most fun element of the game.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]My son has become a huge D&D role player so we got him this game to play with the fam for his birthday. We previously owned the Drizzt D&D adventure game, but eventually traded it away because we found it to be too easy. I have to give credit to WotC because they take time fine tuning the game play with each new release of these games. This one seems to have a much more compelling and cohesive story arc that we'll be playing through which is significantly helped because now you earn gold while playing and can spend it in town to get upgrades for your character. There are also consequences after each mission based on whether you won or lost, these include adding new cards to the monster, encounter and treasure decks plus gold, etc. for your character. The ai for controlling the monsters works well and I had much more fun playing as more generic D&D characters as opposed to Drizzt and company. Well worth checking out if you have any interest in D&D and are looking for a fun dungeon crawler.[/i]

Same rating as all the other D&D games using this same rules system. This does some nice things though which may make it the best yet. I like how the tiles vary the number of monsters (0-3) that may be generated, and the addition of exit-traps that block exploration spaces and must be dealt with (and which will inflict 0-4 damage if not disabled). I like the more disciplined campaign structure, although I'm not a fan of the treasure deck moving from a primary focus on enhancements and potions towards just receiving gold - revealing a treasure card is more often anti-climactic as a result. I do like the town scenarios though as a point of departure from the other games, where you start with a set board and reveal an encounter every turn (which generates both straight damage and the monsters to be battled). If I were to get just one of these that have been released so far, on balance this would be it.

This game is just to monotonous. You either flip a tile and fight some monsters, take damage from an encounter, or take damage from an encounter and fight a monster. I'm going to finish going through it but only to say that I did. The miniatures are great though and have been painted for my D&D sessions. This game is more benefit for my D&D sessions than an actual stand alone game. Not mad that I got it for that reason alone, but I am not impressed with the game. Descent 2.0, Level 7 Omega, or Star Wars Imperial Assault are all way better.

Big heavy box, great quality components - huge plus there.

The various classes work well and quite enjoy the dungeon crawl mechanics. 

The ability to follow a campaign and level up along the way is very nice. A new player joining the campaign will not be so far behind as to be useless - they can definitely contribute immediately. Also the mechanic whereby the game adjusts to how good you are - by adding rewards but levelling up enemies if you are getting through levels too easily, very nice touch!

It's my first of the D&D board games, but I really like it!

I had high hopes for this D&D series but its really simple. I mean, far too simple. The simplicity doesnt stop there, the way the phases work is rubbish and every enemy having a bonus to hit score just means that the playtesting was never done very well. Avoid this series if you actually like boardgames because this really is nothing other than a pretty box on the shelf.

Just played the first adventure today and, as someone who *owns* the original AD&D ToEE adventure, I say make your own themed EVERYTHING! IIRC, In the Temple the different elements were enemy factions. Why is a hobgoblin teaming up with an air cultist teaming up with a fire cultist in a room with the earth element glyph? Instead of a themed game reflecting the uniqueness and epic AD&D adventure, we have yet another hodgepodge of generic monster stats in a generic dungeon. I say go through all your D&D Adventure Games and make monster, event, and dungeon tiles decks reflecting the four elemental factions. 

Oh, well. At least I can paint the miniatures and run the original ToEE with man-dollies now!

The more I play this the more impressed I am. This is Descent lite. Great as an intro for kids and some nice simple mechanics but nonetheless a challenging game. I particularly like the mechanic whereby if more than one monster of a type is in play they all activate every time one activates. Really puts the pressure on and our games have all been tight. The campaign element Just's adds that bit more than I believe the other games in this series have.

Dungeons and Dragons, the classic, the originator, the slick, mass produced, efficient...what? That's how I describe this board game. The minis aren't top notch, they look kinda mass produced. The cards are very plain looking but extremely efficient. They have no art other than the mini that is to go out on the board when you draw the card. The text is large and readable on a clean background. There are different colored, clearly labeled card backs so to easily tell which card deck is which. Everything card and board tile is adorned with the D&D logo keeping with the overall art of the entire package. The gameplay is quick and to the point without any fiddly bits or rules. The rulebook is easy to read. If you condensed the text spacing it could easily be half the pages but it's not. Just efficient and easy to play. Nothing at all wrong with that but I have to say I am really surprised. I thought if there was a deep dungeon crawler it would be the Original, right? Nope. It's the cleanest, and dare I say sterile, board game I've come across. Lots of fun, though, I'm rating it an 8. If there was some more theme thrown in, maybe some actual artwork, a little deeper gameplay, I think it would be perfect. As it stands now it is the board game I get out on to the table the most. I am sticking with this one until the next cycle though. I've seen some playthroughs of the newest D&D board game Tomb of Annihilation and it is waaaaay similar to this game.

I've been playing D&D since about 1979 but I haven't had much to do with since around the 4 edition or so.  As a whole I really like how they have boiled down D&D mechanics to a more simpler way of doing things.

This is my first run with this game series and I will say I was surprised by the amount of fun I had trying it solo at first then with my wife and sister in law, they both had fun with the first adventure.  After we run through the adventure book I may update my thoughts then.  I do like the idea that this can be added to with the others in the "series".  Gives for great replayability.  

Game is easy to pick up and there shouldn't be much to any arguing over rules, things are very boiled down.  My biggest gripe with the game is that the figures aren't pre-painted.  Painting figures really isn't something I enjoy a whole lot any more, but these will get paint at some point.

A fun dungeon-crawler which doesn't require a player to act as GM. Many of the rules come from 4e D&D, so it's best to play with people who already know that system.

This is one of the more fun dungeon crawler type of games I have played.  I am still not a huge fan of this style, and while I enjoyed my first 3 games in our campaign I felt the game was getting a bit old.  I could see enjoying maybe half a dozen games and then moving onto something else.

Love this game. Random dungeon generation means great replay value. Rules/mechanics are pretty straightforward, and the game moves quickly. Success is not (always) easy and takes luck and strategic thinking. It could be a wonderful way to introduce someone to concepts and nature of D&D, as it adapts many of the mechanics of 5E wonderfully well (even levelling up!). Keen to get the other games in the Adventure Series.

Not a bad game. I like most of the abstraction and streamlining. But then some things like traps are pretty out of place.

Automated dungeon crawl, where evil forces have programming on their cards.

Addition of campaign elements and the town etc provides a nice feel similar to computer RPGs. Dungeon crawl, head to town after adventure, buy/sell go back into the depths.

Great solo/coop game for fantasy lovers. It's D20 die roll so there is a good dose of luck. But I like what it does and it's just simple and good fun.

Worse than the previous installments in a couple of ways - e.g., vanilla monsters that are overly similar, a repetitive trap system - but the campaign model is fresh and well-implemented.  

[i]Update:[/i]

We finally finished a leisurely two-player campaign (one character each) that - off and on - lasted five months.  Overall it was solid family fare, though some of the village scenarios were only 10-15 minutes long with the two characters that we selected.  It was good for ~16 plays total, since a few scenarios needed to be repeated due to healing surge losses. [i]Warning[/i]: There's a player decision in the final scenario that is ridiculously unbalanced in a 2-player game.  Probably best to ignore it altogether.

Examining the coop line as a whole, the non-campaign D&D games (Ravenloft, Ashardalon, Drizzt) are more suitable for random play, in which gaming partners change from week to week and no one cares which scenario is being played.  ToEE is for families or game group regulars who are willing to commit for the long-term. The earlier releases have more interesting monsters and effects, admittedly, but you miss out on the character build-up and sense of progression that you find in [i]Temple[/i]. 

Anyway, I consider ToEE "completed" and don't need to play again - except perhaps with grandkids in 20 years.  But it was an entertaining barrage of loot, monsters, encounters, and advancements while it lasted.

Hmmmm, the campaign rules are nice but it lacks thrill.
To easy for us.

We have to be doing something wrong, but not sure what. We die within a few tiles. That makes it pretty discouraging to attempt. :-/

Not sure why it's rated so low. I think it might compete for the best game of all four. The campaign has been designed in a much more modern way compared to its predecessors. I like the theme a lot, the outdoor side of the campaign is also a very nice addition. Not a billion tokens but I think the game has added exactly what has been missing to the series, nothing more nothing else. A full hit for me. The black dragon is nearly unbeatable in 4-5 players groups, that is what I call an epic fight. The game reaches its full potential when combined with the others in Epic mode.

This was a great break from the standard card games my family normally plays.  My daughter, niece and I loved playing and couldn't wait for the next adventure.  Once you get passed the first adventure, the rules get much easier.  I found that some of the rules aren't crystal clear so we would decide as group the rule and implement it going forward.  We have failed a couple of times to win an adventure but didn't mind starting it over.  Fun characters, nice sturdy design and forces you to think.

More of the same as Castle Ravenloft and Ashardalon.  Not a bad game but will only purchase if I want the monsters from it.

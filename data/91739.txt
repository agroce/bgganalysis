I'm not going to rate Somme 1918 because I have not played it.  I was too lazy to read the rules before buying the game.  Had I done so, I would have known that this game was not my style.  Clues: the outline basic game sequence in the rules fills a page; lots of marker chits for this and that; fiddly stacking rules; a TEN step sequence for each combat; needing to keep track of the units that did not move, because they can be declared reserves; a set-up (scenario two) that took me two hours.

Those are all issues of wargaming taste.  I do have a few gripes that aren't:  hex numbers in brown against a pock-marked brown background were almost impossible to read; the counters had the worst die-cutting I've come across in a while; in scenario two, French air support reinforcements are listed in the scenario, but not on the reinforcement sheet.

A very enjoyable game with some interesting nuances. The way combat is handled with tactical rolls alongside casualties leads to interesting outcomes.

Preliminary review based on out-of-the-box inspection.  Wow!  Very nice components, top notch.  Quality is very high, and everything is printed in color. Looking forward to getting this interpretation of Operation Michael on the table soon.

RATING: 8.5
Approachable one map wargame showing the late war breakout from the trenches back into mobile warfare.

The tactical co-ordination rolls, which modify combat to allow advances, exploitation, gaffes and withdrawals - and can offer the chance to move nearby unengaged defenders - lifts this greatly. It adds decisions, interest and breathes life into each struggle with one extra roll and look-up.

Quality components - although the counters are almost too thick - and the English rules aren't bad. There are a few oddities and head-scratching moments but nothing horrible.

Tanks, air warfare, some interesting random events chits and a nice artillery system in which it can be lethal but can also be mitigated, rounds out a very solid WW1 game.

The rules are not overly complicated but not very well organised. Rewriting them and debugging them a bit wouldn't hurt. Otherwise the system is very well fitted for this period. The situation depicted is quite tense. Simply the best game on the subject.

preordered at 21-12-2011. Received at 22-06-2012. Great components and design. The better I have seen lastly. Great rules (like predesor). Waiting to take a taste of it.

interesting and clever design. High counter density and starts with a somewhat attritional trench position. Opens out after the break through but is it worth the effort? Simulation fans only.

Excellent system, but because of the initial situation, does not reach the heights of sister game Marne 1918.

Ordered from Nuts!

Too complex for my preferences, too many counters, too much detail. It does what it intends to do, but it's really long and requires too much active brain power to keep me going.

RATING: N/A
Working through the rules now.  Doesn't see too overwhelming, but need a dang set of forceps to maneuver the counters, which tend to be in large stacks for the German assault.  Could just be a minor thing...

Received the game last Friday.

It looks fantastic, especially the way the play aid cards are done.

Looking forward to playing it soon.

 A good game that I would like to give a higher rating. I unfortunately found the small hexes, plus a very high counter density to detract a lot from the enjoyment of the game.

The main battle field in WWI.  Somme, we never game it enough.....Let me see if I can get a chance to play it in 2018 for its 100th anniversary.

Somme 1918 uses one of the better WW I systems. It's not quite as complex as GMT's 1914 series, but like it uses a two-stage combat system to capture the chaos of tactical-level command-and-control in that war.  Was it really the tank that distinguished WWII from WW I or was it the radio?  This level of fidelity is always a three-edged sword in WW I.  First, it gives you a great simulation.  Second, it makes combat more complex, although not quite as much in Somme as in the 1914 series.  Third, any good WW I simulation bogs down as soon as an attack outruns its artillery support.  In Somme 1918, unless you break through decisively by the end of turn 1 (actually 3 IGO/UGO cycles since it's an offensive turn), you're going to be grinding away trying to get a bridgehead over the Somme.  I achieved such a break through in one playing and failed in the other.  That second time it seemed like I was always on the verge of racing west, but every time the French or British plugged the gap.  Great game if you like WW I, good game otherwise.  Nail biting in either case.

The rules are mostly clear, but a few gaps exist along with some typos.  Key gaps (as far as I can tell) include not stating what effect a step loss marker has on a three-step unit and not stating where in the sequence of play the marker adjustment segment comes. But hey it's WW I, you've got to expect some communication difficulties.  Everything is said in exactly one place and not always the spot you'd first think to look.  That makes for quick rule reading, but a slow first turn or two of hunting up details unless you've got a photographic memory.  The player aid card has lots of what you need to remember, but by no means all.  I wish they'd covered the back side with a crib sheet instead of artwork.  

The map is glossy on the back, but matte on front and sports 5/8" hexes.  That extra space relative to the 1/2" pieces is a big help as the most useful stacks are 5 pieces high and operate in groups.  The pieces are highly legible, even across the full width of the map.  The are, however, the hardest to punch out of the sheet that I've ever seen.  If you hate corner chads, you're in for some work.  The glossy player aid cards are robust, but printing the information on top of dark artwork did not make them easier to read.  The glossary was a nice touch, but was not alphabetized.  Perhaps it was in the original French?

Bottom line: great simulation and tense game that plays out in one really long day.

The components are first rate; I'd say among the best in the hobby.  

I definately plan to buy the third game as soon as it is published.

First impression of the system is positive  after a scenario played two times: sharpness and the subtlety in the practice.

The power of the artillery and the specialization of the units as the stosstruppen is well enough retranscribed.
Fights are bloody. Come as you warfare...

Première impression positive du système après un scénario joué en aller-retour: de la finesse et de la subtilité dans la pratique.

La puissance de l'artillerie et la spécialisation des unités comme les stosstruppen est assez bien retranscrite.

Great components that give the will to play the game immediately.

I can't wait to give it a try ...

Milestone battle of the first world war, basically one of the first times one of the participants managed to break the trench stalemate on the west front. 

The game shows you why it was possible with special rules for the introduction of the Stosstruppen, the new German artillery doctrine and the crucial coordination rolls which allows the defender to trade terrain for losses, and the attacker to advance after combat/exploit.

pros : high quality components, clever mechanisms, nice amout of chrome with the campaign rules and the special events chits, interesting battle, can match the historical outcome pretty closely while still providing lots of options for the attacker.
cons : uh not a whole lot, it might be a bit one sided in the beginning but later the French have the possibility to launch a counter offensive, the first couple of turns take a hell of a long time and finally stacking is a bit cumbersome.

Excellent design. Not very fast, but exciting for both sides...prepare to wet your pants as the Allies during the first offensive

Updated to a 9...maybe the best WWI operational system out there...less fiddly than 1914 from GMT

Toujours l’excellent système de Marne 1918. Le système aérien et de renfort a même été affiné. Cependant le jeu est de moindre ampleur : il n'y a pas ces allers-retours d'attaque contre-attaques de Marne 1918. Il y a (il me semble après une partie) des offensives allemandes et si l'Entente survit une contre-attaque.

Fantastic components, box cover, the rules are clear, but the campaign is quite one-sided, in the one I played, because Combat are so hard, the allied player made 2 combats during the whole campaign. To high density of counters for me.

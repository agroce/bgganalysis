"Stripped back" or "streamlined" are often positive terms in board gaming, but there needs to be enough left to keep a game interesting. This game treads a very fine line. There is enough here that the game makes sense, and there are a few decisions to be made (albeit they are not all that interesting). There isn't enough here for the game to have any personality, or innovation, and hence it feels a little pointless. The game recalls Rattus, which I enjoy very much specifically because it has so much character. I think there is a place for 10-15 minute games, but I don't think this one quite does it for me.

RATING: 6
Area control and set collection tick just the right boxes for me. And this one plays fast too although not in 8 minutes. Perhaps 8 minutes per player would be more appropriate.

I liked how quickly the rules were explained but still the game succeeded in offering meaningful decisions almost every round. You are balancing your actions between denying things from opponents and gaining yourself. It is this kind of trade-offs I especially enjoy in games.

My only concern about the game is, that with a little bad luck you might achieve close to nothing in the game. You are expected to lay cubes and spread them across the map. However, your actions are strictly limited to the options available on the 6 visible cards. If you do not get the right actions, there is nothing you can do about it. In our game, I experienced a couple of rounds that did not benefit me at all and I can imagine a scenario where you get nothing done in the whole game. Luckily the game does not last too long.

Complaints I have about the board that is too small to accommodate all the cubes comfortably without a risk of losing track of where they belong.

In the end I enjoyed the game. With no major flaws it is clearly game that deserves to be played.

The other kind of filler. Plays in about 10 minutes not 8 if everyone knows the rules and plays quick.
Ver fast. Not as good as the classic fillers like King of Tokyo or so, but still some kind of variation and will hit the table often because of its short period of time needed to play.

RATING: 7
It's a Euro filler and pretty decent at that.  It's not an 8-minute game.  If you know what you are doing, I would say it's 8 X (Number of Players) minutes, but that still spells "FILLER" to me.  Good rich choices.

Da justo lo que ofrece; un filler para pasar el rato de manera divertida en pocos minutos.

Ideal para jugarlo entre juegos más pesados o para cuando no hay tiempo para nada largo;

Me ha gustado , la expansión legends mola por cierto.

For fans of area majority games, with straightforward limited resource calculations, this is a really nice, quick filler that really hits the spot.  From a game design point of view, the designer set out to accomplish something very specific (see the title) with this game, and accomplished the goal.  Well done.

RATING: 6.7
Sweet. Should really be called Eight Minutes Per Player Empire but I suppose that's not so catchy. That aside, it's an elegant and engaging game. I'm very fond of the way the economics of declining prices applies to unwanted cards, and the potential dilemmas offered by the two choices on each card (resources/tactical moves). 
Major concern: the randomness of the shuffled deck means that some games have been marred by an early lack of cards allowing for overseas movement, giving a huge advantage to any lucky player who has expanded across the sea. 
On a design note, it's annoying that they've made a board that folds into quarters leaving acres of space around it in the box instead of a board folding just once in half.
(note: inadvertently previously posted this under EME: Legends).

This should be called Eighteen Minute Empire, but it is fast. Take turns drafting cards and taking the actions, which are mainly "Add units to the board" and "move units on the board" and also have a symbol. Cards cost 0-3 coins, of which you only start with a few more than cards you'll draft. When you are done (8 cards with four players, a bit more with less), you get points for each region you have the most units, each continent you have the most regions, and for collecting sets of card symbols.

However, the game does have a significant advantage for the last player, and is rather dry. Not bad, but you can't compress a good empire game down. So, not great.

UPDATE: This one is going in my closet and is up for trade due to the fact that EME:Legends can be played pretty much the exact same way AND has more when players are ready for the extra stuff.

I love this game.  Even though games take more like 10-20 minutes (not eight), this game has A LOT of depth for such a short experience.

Rating based on the fact that it is very simplistic and plays very, very quickly while retaining an adequate degree of interesting decisions. With rules explanation it took about 15 minutes with five players. 

It is an area majority and set collecting filler that doesn't overstay it's welcome. It has a place in my collection because of the Euro feel and quick playtime. The artwork and style helps with the theme and looks great. I could see the games coming in at quicker than 15 minutes with experience. Recommended as a filler for Euro gamers.

RATING: 6
A short, area control and card drafting game in which you try to earn the most points (from territory control and end-of-game card bonuses) in a limited number of rounds (8 or 10).  It takes more than 8 minutes but probably under 30.  The cards with end game bonus points are very specific so sometimes it's better to buy a card that's very valuable to your opponent to keep it from him rather than buying a low value card for yourself.  Money is used to buy/draft cards, and money is tight/limited, which makes for some interesting and difficult decisions.  Overall, it's decent for a small and simple area control game, but I'm not fond of the genre, and some of the cards seem to be swingy/unbalanced (especially the immunity to attacks card).  Maybe the advanced rules or expansions improve these issues.

It's a minimalist, bare bones, stripped down empire building (area control) game played over a fixed number of rounds.  The "Dire Giant" card that makes you immune to attacks seems like a broken card (too powerful).  It's definitely longer than 8-minutes (1st game = 3 players, 30 minutes).  I'm not fond of area control games.

Others say:  dry, significant advantage for the last player.

Hey, it's only 8 minutes right - so it can't be bad? 

This isn't for me, I'd rather make the coffee in the 8 minutes than play this, area majority isn't my favourite mechanic and there's nothing here to make me want to spend 8 more minutes than the 16 I've already used playing it twice.

Kickstarted

While we were waiting for the rest of our usual Tuesday night group to show up we were able to get a quick 2 player game of this in... I can see that this game has some potential, but I don't think it's ment to be played with two players. With that in mind I'm going to hold off making a descision about it until I've played it some more.

Because people are nosey I've lowered my rating of this game.

What a great simple, fast area majority game. Each turn choose a card from the track of six and there will be a cost unless you take the first.

No, it doesn’t take 8 minutes, but it’s not that far off. I guess if you had played it a couple of times before and were only 2 players playing, you could finish it in 8 minutes, but in my experience it takes around 15-20 minutes – which is still an acceptable timeframe. The game itself is okay; not good, but not bad either. Actually, considering it only takes about 15 minutes I think there is some meat to the game. I like area control games in general and this one does it fine considering the short play time. It mixes area control with set collection, both of which are very important in order to win.

The different abilities on the cards are neat; I like that you want to get a lot of similar cards in order to score more points, but that you also need to focus on the abilities the cards provide. And while you’re evaluating these factors you also need to consider how much the card costs; the row of cards cost between 0 and 3 coins, and you only have 11 coins to buy all of your cards!

I’ve played it twice, once with 3 players and once with 4, and I must say that I definitely think it works best with 4 players. The reason is that the board becomes much more crowded which translates into fierce competition. With 3, two of the players fought each other and neutralized each other which made the third person win; the one who expanded the other way and didn’t face any real competition… I guess that’s how it goes for all these types of games when playing with 3, so it’s always something that this one plays so quickly.

A very quick, simple area control game.  It succeeds in being fast to play (and to learn), yet reasonably fun to play.  Nice artwork, reasonably interesting gameplay for such a simple game, and playable in a short timeframe.  Worth packing as something to play between larger games on the weekend.

A fine game, but boxed in by the premise, unfortunately -- there's just not enough here to make you forget about really good area control games but adding anything more would ruin the fundamental hook of "it's a real game that you can play in, um, eight minutes, err, more like twenty."

Again, it's aight but mostly I just think that you could invest an additional 20 minutes and play King of Siam/The King Is Dead instead...

2014-07-12: Played this for the first time last night, all of us were newbs, and it was a fun game.  Plays fast, and the game is more about "civilization" than about conquest.

[floatright][imageid=1973896small][/floatright] Eight Minute Empire is a perfect way to introduce a quick little area control/influence game to your spouse. 

"Hey honey, do you want to play a game tonight?"
"I'm really tired"
"It's called Eight-Minute Empire."
"Why is it called that?
"Because it only takes eight minutes* to play"
"Really?! Ok!"

[i]* Eight minutes is a tad on the optimistic side...but you get the point - it is short! [/i]

Eight-Minute Empire is a very fast card-driven, area control and set collection game. The order in which the cards are introduced into the game can really change the overall flow and strategy of the game, which makes for a very enjoyable little filler!

RATING: 3
A simplistic sort-of majorities game disguised as a civilisation builder... which ultimately fails by not doing much at all. I don't think I've had the pleasure yet of making acquaintance with a game which was [i]too quick[/i], yet EME manages it. The problem as I see it is that the board starts out with all players having a few cubes in a single region, and then have but eight actions to introduce new cubes, move them around, gain majorities, and possibly prod butt a little. If the actions enter the game semi-randomly (because your financial means are limited, so you often end up taking more or less what is cheapest, which is a random card), and new cubes only in the starting area or an area with a city (which takes a valuable action to build) then having 8 of them really aren't much to accomplish anything. Contrast to King of Siam which is also about cubes on a map, 8 actions, and eventually majorities: that game is a brain burner of surprisingly epic proportions given the parsimonity of your options.

Oh, what was I thinking: this is a Kickstarter design which has since been picked up by a major publisher. Now while that is an achievement to be justly proud of, I can't help but wish it had happened to another design because to me EME is just another example of the shapeless and tasteless lukewarm grey goo with lumps pre-order factory Kickstarter hurls out onto its masochistic backers. [i]Le plaisir de se voir imprimé[/i] can be very satisfying, but isn't it about time we collectively realise this isn't what Kickstarter ought to be about?

Adding insult to injury, there seems to be a re-edition out, EME: Legends, which deals with a lot of the above issues without sacrificing quickness of play or its accessibility. Why wasn't [i]that[/i] game picked up by the publisher then...??!

Have only played this as a two-player game to date, but the game was very enjoyable.  Teaches and plays quickly, as intended, although it was more like 20 minutes -- not eight.  My wife enjoyed this game and asked for more plays, even though she did not win. 
This game is a great balance of quick setup and play, with enough strategy to make it you want to play again.

Revised.  Now 10 games with 2, 3, and 4 players.  I am rating this an 8.  A great, light game, that plays and teaches quickly.

Played only 2 times. It's meant to be a filler but I'm not eager to take it out to the table. In fact, it seems to be a waste of time.

I don't get the feeling of building an empire or conquering new lands. I feel like gathering resources, which is good. But still, I need to play more to give an objective rating. I want to like this game.

EDIT: After some more plays it still doesn't feel like a game about conquering. It's more random with 4-5 players (you have no option to influence all your opponents) but I know it will get better after getting to know the game more...

Do you buy empire, legends, or legends and the expansion?  Buy all three and it's as much as twilight imperium.  That's a bit bonkers for such a cheap, small game I keep in the car.  The components are a bit cheap in empires, especially the board which appears hand laminated.  Pretty fun for how simple it is.  However, this game would benefit from more direct player interaction without requiring the fantasy theme of legends.

This is a mini fast pace strategy game. For sure it takes a little bit more than 8 min. to built your empire but it is fun and recreational. The player is faced with very many options and alternatives which makes it hard to make up your mind when your turn comes because he can only take one action. The winner is the one who scores the most. Scoring is based on territory control and various goods he has gathered on his way to expansion. Each play is intriguing and shares no similarities with the previous one. The more players the merrier. The two different maps, the Mountains expansion and the Europe map board expansion add even more flavor for endless varieties. A nice addition to the boardgaming world.

Decent "meaty filler" that pretty much achieves what it aims for.   Cards are drafted from a row (a la Magical Athlete) which provide resource symbols and actions.   The symbols score in larger sets just like the Bean-O-Meter in Bohnanza.   The action on the chosen card lets you place cubes, move cubes, create new spawn points for cubes, or perhaps (rarely) attack another player.  The map scores as basic area majority.   Nothing new here, unless you consider the fact that you get 7 micro-turns and then the game is over in TWENTY minutes.  Not EIGHT.    Not bad, for a Kickstarter game.  Pleasant, but probably has a short shelf life.

Eight-Minute Empire is one of my favorite small box light games. Considering there are only a handful of turns and each turn you really get one main decision a lot can happen in that condensed time frame. Surprisingly the theme does work and it does have a feel of early civilizations growing and expanding across a new region. The sequel game Legends I feel is superior as a whole with the additional options and variations but the original has a cleanness that is quite desirable and allows both to feel at home side by side on my shelf.

[1 play] Not quite 8 minutes, but certainly could get close once everyone knew how to play. The card scoring is a little graphically confusing, but otherwise this game is OK. On one hand, this takes almost to an absurd level the current tendency to want to abridge everything.  Why can't we just accept that a game about the rise and fall of civilizations cannot be short?  On the other hand, if you want a decent filler with a vague thematic taste of civilization-building, why not?  there are plenty of worse games.

I like card drafting, and it was rather fun and cute the first time, but the second time the sheen wore off and it became obvious that the actions just aren't dynamic enough to make for an interesting game. The way cards come out and turn order will dictate far more of the game than player decisions, which is too bad. Had the actions been all more equivalent and tantalizing, there could've been some interesting decisions to be had. As it is, the choice of which card to buy is almost always automatic, and you know if you're in the running or out of it by mid-game.

I got the PNP off of Kickstarter. It's not a bad filler game, but don't expect anything too amazing. It felt like luck of the draw could determine whether or not you are able to take the sailing routes and build new armies (both of which you want to do), taking a lot of the decisions out of the players' hands. I liked the set collection aspect.

Decent enough filler. It really is a very fast area control game. It seems like the map dynamic would be very different depending on the numbers of players. With 3 there wasn't a lot of competition.

Interesting empire building, area control, set collection game.

Each turn you gain one card which has a good at the top and an action at the bottom. Multiples of the same good at the end of the game score victory points thus there is a set collection aspect. 

The actions at the bottom allow you to colonise the map by adding more armies (cubes) or a city, move armies around and one or two eliminate your opponents armies. Majorities in each area score victory points as do majorities in each of the continents. 

This is exactly what is says on the box... empire building in eight minutes. It is complex and deep as is to be expected in only eight minutes and is a welcome diversion at the end of a long gaming session or as a warm up at the beginning.

Each player has 8 turns, so it's considerably longer than 8 minutes. it's very basic, and much turned on which cards came out when. Going long on one suit seemed more valuable than covering land. I'm not convinced this isn't a flash in the pan.

Jó kis area influence, ami belefér 20-30 percbe. Van benne szerencse, de vannak döntések is bőven.

A good filler set collecting x area control game with more weight to it than the speed of the game belies. It reminds me of King of Siam in complexity, but with less depth and less reliance on intricate tie breakers. It packs a lot of game in a tight simple package.

Kickstarter game received May 2013. Cute lightweight and quick area control game that is amusing to play. Nothing more, nothing less. Might also be good with younger kids as a first taste of Euro cubes - rating 7 (July 2013). UPDATE  Actually, whilst i like the production, game wise it is unfortunately less than more - maybe as a game with Stevie, but i have no buy in with this game when i play it (rating down to 5 (Dec 13)). UPDATE Im still willing to give this another go as I like the concept (Rating 5.832 Jan 17)

I was actually surprised how well this one played. There is nothing new in this game (area control, card drafting on a reducing payment system, set collection) but it is a rather tight game and decisions always feel tough. I think that as far as a light euro goes, this is one that the kids in my school board game group would be able to fully comprehend and get as much enjoyment out of it as an adult. That's not an easy thing to do in game design without it coming off too light for adult tastes. A cute little game that is very nice for what it is. The game sort of forces certain moves out of you, but there is enough decision making there to make this one a very pleasant filler. Smart, compact design that doesn't try to be any more than what it is.

RATING: 6
Does what it sets out to do -- an empire, area control game in 15-20 minutes. And to that end, it's completely stripped down, which it needs to be. But that means there's not much here to bring you back, there's nothing to explore. It needs something else interesting to work out, but then that would make the game longer...which would defeat the purpose. So just merely good with little replay value.

For a standard game I would rate this only 6, but as a quick filler it deserves a 7.
Downside is the small map (compared to the box size), even with only two players the map gets pretty crowded with cubes. So some inches larger/longer would have been easy possible.

The mechanics are nice enough to ensure an enduring place at the table and it can be played really fast if you played at least once. Decisions abound and seem to hit the sweet spot between complexity and simplicity with a game of this type. 

All in all a nice little game. ;)

What a misleading title. I love the idea of a portable, fast-playing area majority game but so much depends on the random card draw that it can create very unfair situations. One of our players never got the chance to build a city or sail out of the main continent. In a game that's all about expanding, it's a sin.

Interesting little filler. Basically, it's all about choosing which card to buy, balancing three elements: the price (you have a limited amount of money for the whole game), the one time action the card offers (that helps you expand on the board), and the good depicted on the card (the more you have of one type, the more vp you get at the end of the game).

RATING: 5
Harmless little game where you acquire cards that allow you to place and move cubes on the map. In the end, you score sets of resources on the cards and majorities on the board. It's all fine, but the map should scale with the number of players, as I played with three and there was too much space, resulting in little competition for regions. The game is very straightforward and works as a filler, but the uninspired design, boring artwork and simple components don't put me in any rush to play it again.

For how short it is, its a very solid light filler game.  The set collection aspect of the game is pretty bland but there are some interesting choices in how you play the area majority part of the game and the set collection makes those choices more complicated.  If it took 30 minutes I'd call it too simple for what it is - but at 15 minutes its a cool little game.  I think its a bit too long for two players but 3 or more its quite fun.  Good non-gamer game too

Quick to learn, even quicker to play. Set collection with area control, this little euro packs a punch. There's a lot of game in this little box ad so far we've really enjoyed our first plays of it. I wish that it allowed for true two-player game play without setup for the potential plays of a third player, but it doesn't detract from the game too much. I see myself really enjoying this moving forward and can't wait to take it out with more players. Also, it's a Ryan Laukat game, so it's gorgeous with fantastic production quality.

Each turn, you pick up one card from the table and execute the action on the card. The further down the card is in the line [ie: the newer it is] the more expensive the cost is. The money that you start the game out with is all you get the whole game, so you need to weigh if it is worth paying 3 out of 9 (or whatever your money is) to buy the newest card on the board or wait a round and see if you can get that card later cheaper or for free. 

Early on it seems that most players pick cards based on what card actions they want. Most actions are placing cubes onto a map, move them around to other regions, or build a city. 

Near the end of the game, the focus seems to be more on picking cards to complete the sets players started earlier on. Ie: if you picked up two cards with the tree symbol, you get 1 victory point, but if you pick up three tree symbol cards, you will get 3 victory points. The game ends after everyone has 8 cards, so collecting sets can be tight, even with the help of the occasional wild card.

Points are awarded by how many regions you have the most cubes in and how many of the four continents you have the most regions under control. Points are also awarded for the sets you managed to complete.

The game is short. I think it takes longer to explain the game than to play because on your turn, you pick a card and do its thing. A nice filler game. I wish the game came with point tokens though to make it easier to add up points at the end. (You either have to get scratch paper or do it in your head.)

Very simple, very fast, some strategic play but you only have 7 actions per game, so random card luck does come into play so you need to have a plan and try to stick to it.  Balance the set collection with area control to win.  Nothing more than a filler, but seems like a nice one.  Don't think I'd get any of the others in the series as these are just the same game with minor tweaks that can easily be adapted to this version.

Not a bad game by any stretch, but just a rather unexciting one.  Pick a card, place or move a cube or two, repeat 7 more times.

In an era when other designers are trying to pack in every possible mechanic, this game is like a breath of fresh air. This is a euro game boiled down to its core essence, providing an experience free of extraneous fluff.

While this certainly falls into the filler category (our games last about 15 minutes), there are more decisions per minute than in just about any game I can think of. Scores tend to be very close, with the tiebreaker coming into play quite frequently, especially with more players.

In short, Eight-Minute Empire is a winner, providing a lot of "game" for very little time/money.

It's a short game (though maybe longer than eight minutes) that presents some fun decisions regarding actions and area control. It's a bit too light to be considered extremely strategic, but it does scratch the itch to play something in this genre.

Thematically light -- didn't feel like building an empire. Disliked the "act of god" removal of an empire. Found the actions permitted to be much too constraining.

One must admire the sheer ambition of a game involving continents, armies, cities, and goods, which mechanically handles all these aspects using just 30-something card drafts.

So, there's not a lot of game here, but of course, there isn't really supposed to be. For what it is, I think it does a good job.

RATING: 9
It's got ingenious mechanisms for placing and moving armies and cities that work together so smoothly.  It's amazing that they squeezed all that strategic depth into 8 or 9 minutes.  

It seems strange to rate a game that has a 4-page manual a 9.  I also give it points for being so inexpensive, though it does have high-quality components: a nice double-sided board, a deck of cards, chits, and wooden army cubes and city cylinders in 5 colors.

Cheap, strategic, easy to learn, and plays fast with 2-5 players.  What more could you ask for?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is an easy to teach and fast playing game of empire building.  You can teach even non-gamers how to play in 5 minutes, and playtime is 15-30 minutes.  It is a good introductory game to the "I've only played Monopoly and Risk" crowd, and a good time-filler for when a group of people is sitting around waiting for another game to end.

Initial Rating: 5.0 (March 2014)

I’m disappointed, I was expecting a better game :(. The game is very easy to learn and teach and the game components are ok. The playtime is very short but (generally) it is more than 8 minutes.

I didn’t felt the advertised “though decisions”, all is (more or less) obvious and straightforward. Also I don’t get why anyone would bid to go first as going last is a HUGE advantage. The game has a lot of luck in the cards.  I dislike both of these factors, but they don’t bother me much due to the game´s length.

Some friends love the game so I bought it along with the Legends standalone game. Perhaps that was a mistake.

For now I will play again and again (15 minute game after all) to see if I missed something, but as it stands, 8 Minute Empire (and Legends) is in my list of games to sell. The game has the potential go to down in my ratings.

The  playtime wildly varies, it depends on how fast are the players (obviously :P) but our fastest games have been in the 16 minute mark. If a player manages to exit the continent (not always is possible), he has more chances of winning the game. The resource variant is ok, it doesn’t add much to the game. 

Still disappointed in this game.

It is my belief that you can't rate this game compared to deeper and longer games - that's not fair.  Nor is it trying to be those games.  However, if I compare this game to other filler games, it just shines so brightly.  Depending on the number of players it is 10-15 minutes of fun with remarkably important decisions.  Plus, as a filler, it is just so different from other filler games.

This game is elegant and well designed, even the variants.  I get why people who do not like fillers would not like this game, because it IS a filler.  For people who like fillers (because you are waiting for players or do not have a lot of time on some nights) and do not mind a little direct conflict, it really belongs in your collection.

Eight minutes is pushing it, but if you double that you'll find a fun majority control and set collecting game that doesn't outstay its welcome.

Some of the card play reminded me a little of King of Siam, but it's not as tight and unforgiving (out in truth as tense and involving) as that game. Room for both, though.

I prefer EME: Legends, but this is also quite engaging.

Pros:
- Very fast, but a real game
- A very nice, simple core of gameplay (card = turn = action & resource)
- Very compact, both in box and on table

Cons: 
- Quite small parts, yet board is occasionally too small for some pileups.

Eight-Minute Empire is an interesting game and tries to pack a lot of game into a small 10 minute or so game.  In the end, it doesn't fail, it just feels to be missing something.  What is that thing?  I couldn't tell you.  It just left me wanting something just a tad bit more.  I have some expansions so, I'll have to see if those add the something.

RATING: 7
A pleasant surprise for a hyped Kickstarter-originated microgame although the price tag at least in Germany is above those of many full-fledged games barring it from entering my wishlist.

In a five-player game, each player has 7 turns, buys a card every turn and executes its action. At game end, each majority in an area awards a point, each majority on a continent awards a point and collected sets of symbols on the cards give points. With less players, there are more turns.

Eight Minute Empire manages to cram the feeling of a multiplayer-conflict game into a minimal structure at the cost of comparably high randomness (fine for the short playing time) and player order issues that bother me. While the start player advantage is mitigated by auctioning this position, a player following the start player will potentially benefit from this auction without any cost. More seriously, the last player has a strong advantage in the last round when it comes to shaping the final majorities.

Notwithstanding this major weakness, Eight Minute Empire was fun and I gladly will play it again when the opportunity arises. After all, its main selling point is its shortness that softens the negative aspects of multiplayer-conflict like direct player targeting and kingmaking.

A fun little idea for a game, and probably at its best when everyone is familiar with the rules and it actually ends in around 8 minutes. There doesn't seem to be much variability, and I'm not sure it would be worth the investment to get to the point where it plays in 8 minutes. Because at that point, I'm not sure if it would have much more life in it.

Eddig egy kétfős játéknál tartunk, az első benyomások jók, szórakoztató játéknak tűnik. Egyszerűek a szabályok, de este, fáradtan még így is sikerült félreérteni dolgokat. :)

Viszont szerintem a tábla méretezése nevetséges. Kétszemélyes játék során is kicsinek tűnik, de elképzeltem a látványt, hogy négyen körbeüljük.... Ráadásul amerikai videókon azt látni, hogy két darab kétoldalas tábla jár a játékhoz, itt meg a lóbádzset egy túlhajtogatott kétoldalas tábla található a dobozban. Oké, nem olyan drága a játék, de annyira nem is olcsó, hogy lefelezzük a lehetőségeket...:( Ráadásul létezik Európa térkép, de ebben a magyar kiadásban nincs...

További partik lejátszása után továbbra is, és egyre inkább problémásnak érzem a játéktáblát. NAGYON kicsi, és egyszerűen nem nyílik ki rendesen, a hajtogatások mentén mindig felpúposodik. A fejenkénti 14 egység tényleg túlzsúfolt még kétfős játéknál is (és én általában még le sem rakom a városaimat). Nem értem a koncepciót. Ez persze nem magát a játékot minősíti, csak a kivitelezést. A játék továbbra is érdekes, sőt javítottam is az értékelésemen. Mondjuk a játékváltozatok között szerepeltetni azt, hogy kockával dobjuk ki, hogy ki kezdjen, megint egy olyan pont, amin jót röhögtem. :)

2015.06.23 Have played this four times now, 2 2-player games, 1 3-player, and 1 4-player. The latter two had some non-gamer friends join in and they were perfectly happy in terms of length and heaviness, so that is a big plus in my book. In fact, I've been very happy with the variation in this game so far and how suitable it is as a filler that feels light enough to the newbies but heavy enough to keep me interested. 

We've only used the 4-continent side of the board so far. I'm still not sure on the ideal strategy, but it seems that with higher player counts, sticking to the original continent gives you lots of points fast and you should only move to other continents when it's easy. Since dominating a continent is not worth much (I feel it should be worth more), it seems better to just get as many territories as cheaply as possible, i.e. by sticking to that original continent. The 3-player game seemed to have the best balance between being able to move freely and having enough competition to compel you to spread out.

Played three times, 2p, 4p.  A very nice area majority game that, while it takes more than eight minutes, should clock in at less than 15 minutes with explanation.

Recommended, particularly for that filler position.

Less is more, must have thought Ryan Laukat, and indeed it is. What a great small game this is. Simple, fast, short duration but enough interesting decisions to make to make you want to play it again, and again and again.

It stole some ideas from El Grande, Risk and Rattus, but the result is a completely different game that focusses on a different goal, namely, have fun for 15 minutes without breaking your mind. Ideal as a filler. Even plays well with 2.

Some advice on selecting players for this game
- avoid aggressively playing people that prefer to lower the score of specific other players over scoring points themselves. These people hardly ever win the game, they only think it is their duty to eliminate others
- avoid people that treat this game as a strategic game and want to over analyse it. The game will take ages with these people, and at the end of the game they will whine that there is too much luck in the game.. duh..
- avoid people that prefer to talk and whine during the game, because the card that they need isn't there. 

THIS IS A FILLER GAME !! There is a lot of luck involved. Accept it.

Minus: 3 (replayability) - 10
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Quick, light area control w/ set collection. Would love to see a heavier version of this game where you buy the cards, but they go in to your hand instead of being played immediately - add some hand management.

Need to play this, China, and Rattus more.  They all seem somewhat similar so not sure I have room in my collection for all of them.

A fine filler.  I think it has an issue with seeming limited every game.  Like..."if only there were two more rounds I could do this!" type of thinking.

Really good filler game that leaves a little to be desired in the decisions making area. Not as much player interaction for an area control game as I would of thought. Only two cards in the deck really allow you to effect other players. Will definitely have to play again to see if I'm just missing something. But would be a nice easy game to teach to non-gamers.

+/-With 2p you can really play this in 8min, with more, hmm. If it takes 20min then we're quite close to China which is much deeper game, so..
+/-Depth, always play with the variant to add at least some
-Replayability. Yes the board has two sides but the sides are interesting for 3 games max. So that makes 6-7 8-min games. Hmm.

2-Player Comment:
*8 Minute Empire uses dummy setup mechanic for 2p, it's bit extra effort, but you can forget about it right after setup. You could also randomize the setup, which is maybe my preferred way to play. The gameplay is good enough for 2p making it one of the better 2p area control games.

Another filler game, with a bunch of print and play support. Eight minute empire is enjoyable, however I do not think that it was worth the $25 I spent to get it. It could be easily be played with a print and play map, a couple of extra tokens, and a deck of cards.

Kickstarted. I've played the PnP edition and really enjoyed it. It combines my favorite mechanics from small world and Spartacus but plays much faster. 

I like that it simulates all the conflict of expanding empires without ending up being a wargame. I'm looking forward to trying the new map with resources in key areas.

I would also love to see a mountain terrain type (with a stacking limit of 2) to allow for blocking of other players expansion.

Solid filler that takes about eight minutes per player. Money can be very tight if you aren't careful. The mix of action cards could stand to be improved. There aren't enough water movement cards. Will try next time with the variant of allowing 2 land movements to be used for a single water movement (when using land movement cards). This would allow for greater competition in the corner regions.

10/20/14 Obtained.
11/25/14 Played a four-player game in 21 minutes. 
The game was exactly what I wanted; a quick civ-lite exploration filler that still maintained a good deal of strategy. And it having another map on the back and the goods tokens for variety is quite a bonus. The components are just fine and the rules were very clear. Except for the silly/cute title that I knew couldn't be taken literally, there's no false advertising here. Eight-Minute Empire is a gem.
03/24/15 Played a five-player game in 30 minutes. 06/23/15 Played a five-player game in 25 minutes. 11/14/15 Played a three-player game in 34 minutes.
02/02/16 Played a five-player game in 33 minutes. 4/12/16 Played a five-player game in 24 minutes. We used the goods tokens for the first time.  Why on earth did they back print them?! If the icons had only been on one side I could have turned them face down and shuffled them. But noooo, that would be too easy!  
As of 02/14/18 I've played 16 times.

Rating based on a few 2, 3 and 5 player games.  It plays so fast that it's hard to dislike just because it's over so quick.  It packs a lot into a short time.  Reminded me a lot of Dynasties for a simple area control game but multi-player and distinct in the card play.  Plays tight with any number.  I like it quite a bit.

Eight-Minute Empire is short - but it doesn't play in 8 minutes. 

I like the area of control aspect of this game, but find the set collection to be somewhat boring. In my games, both aspects contribute to the score fairly equally, and you need both to win.

Generally, I would say that this game ends right when it feels like it has really started moving.

Unfortunately, nobody else that I have introduced this to has really taken to it.

Nice small game. Ideal to fill a small amount of time, ~15 minutes.

+ Easy rules. Can't have a lot of difficulties understanding it after the 1st time you play it.
+ Takes a good strategy to win.
+ Takes less than 20 minutes, a nice filler game.

- Small detail and simple rules doesn't allow  it to become a core game, only a supplement in your other games.
- Board is a bit small , though you can simply download any map in a A4 or A3 and play in it.
- Maybe a small change in the point system would do some good (Continents should count as 2 points, or the larger ones as 3, total amount of soldiers to count 1-5 as 1 point 6-9 as 2 etc.), as the most important thing now is to secure the rubees and the other high cost materials.

RATING: 8
Let's rate this as what it is: a filler game lasting 8-12 minutes if everyone knows what they are doing. There are 4x games with more depth, but for how lightweight this one is, I enjoy it and will always play for the sake of a few minutes. I've seen some people say that the map is too small: I disagree! I'd like it to be smaller, if anything. It plays best with 4 or 5 for me, as the lack of space really forces more interesting choices, like smallworld. I've also seen people say that the limited options can induce 'analysis paralysis', but really, it's only a ten minute game; you shouldn't be worrying about the choices that much! Overall, I think you'd struggle to get more game of this style in to such a small time frame.

RATING: 7
Filler material, but with enough depth to accept the needlessly big box this came in.

In this area control game, players first pay for a card depending where the card is located in the draft. Each card has a symbol, and some actions one can perform with the card. The possible actions on the card are putting cubes on the board, move cubes, move cubes by shipping and build a city.  Cubes can be placed only in your cities or on the start space of the board

At the end of the game, players score 1 pt for each majoirty they have in a region, and score 1 pt for each continent they control. In addition, they score points for the sets of symbols they have collected. 

The game plays quickly, typically 20-30 minutes, and being an area control game, you have to compete with your opponents. I like the game, and rating is likely to go up with more plays. There is lot of angst on which cards to pay for and what to leave behind.

One of this game's main strengths is that it is very finite and you can win with a variety of strategies. Focused area control, wide spread control, or card sets can each make or break your score. Balance is best, but dominating one area can win you the game.

When playing this kind of game I do prefer a longer game, with some more chance to develop things, but I think they succeeded very well in designing a "serious" game that fits in the amount that is normally reserved for fillers that are more based on luck or social interaction (or abstracts).
The combination of short and serious is not the best for me (not a big fan of abstracts either), but it offers a nice variation in filler options, and therefore it's a nice addition to my collection.

It's very basic, but it's been improved by the [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/142326/eight-minute-empire-legends2]Legends edition[/url]

I was quite critic with, but after playing it, I think it's a nice filler to play from time to time.

Gioco di successo che ha il grande pregio di sintetizzare (a dir poco) un gioco di civilizzazione in un gioco molto veloce. Otto minuti per un impero è infatti un gioco di civilizzazione ed espansione territoriale condensato in 8 minuti, per la verità saranno un po' di più. Il gioco offre grande interazione e la possibilità di programmare una mini strategia. Giochino di carte immediato e avvincente adatto per ogni occasione che però potrebbe alla lunga stancare.

[i]I found this to be a very bland area control game.
Two things probably doomed this game from the start, I played El Grande around the same time and I only played two player.
I could see this game being better with more, but not that much better.
Everything about the game is bland and boring and the set collection really doesn't fit in with area control.

This is one I was glad to try, because now I know it is not a game I want to own. Although I would play it again with more than two.[/i]

RATING: 6.5
Played both starter maps and old Europe on iOS.  Game is fun and quick to play with simple, however different ways to get points.  Turns and money are limited, thus made decisions often to think through.

The game has an issue with larger player counts, where getting the needed cards can be difficult/random and the number of turns very limited.  Often for area control games, they tend to shine with higher player counts.  I wouldn't play this with over four players.

A solid, fast-playing game reminiscent of Rattus.  I think it is a good bargain, and I can imagine it'll be played from time to time, but really not meaty enough to be a fully developed game, and too thinky to be a good filler.  It falls into a strange category...a crack in my collection that, frankly, I don't think needed filling.  But, it was cheap and entertaining for what it is.  Perhaps the expansions would help?

I've played this a couple of times and I think it packs a good bit of interesting decision choices in each turn and yet plays quickly enough. The mechanics are simple to teach and learn and that there are 2 maps plus variants through the goods tokens makes Eight-Minute Empire have a high replayability. 

However, one factor of concern is that the board is quite small and that in 5 player games it can get very crowded with the army and city tokens. Even with the current box size, it would've been possible to fit in a bigger board easily so I wish the publishers had done that.

Not terrible just very meh. Each player takes it in turn to select a card which contains a trade good an action. They perform the action which adds or moves counters on a board. At the end of the game (a fixed number of turns) they score points for board position (area control) and trade goods (set collection). The idea is clever but its nowhere as fast as eight minutes and the implementation is unfinished. Your play is nuancing only a tiny spread of points so has relatively little impact.

fast play and real choices.  8 minutes is a lie, but it's still short.  Conflict is minimal so spite and kingmaking is marginal.  Mostly it's about maneuvering for majority, and the troop numbers are so low as to make the lack of a second place non-problematic.

update:  ...but much of the game comes down to getting ship card when nobody else does.  Or, on some maps, it basically comes down to bidding the right amount to go last.

I really want to like the game, because it creates some many interesting situations.  But the more I play the less deep it feels and the more it comes down to fairly simple randomness (seating order, arbitrary actions of other players, how the cards come out).

This is a fun little package. I am a sucker for small games that come in very sturdy boxes. It's a bit too bland to hit the table too often, but a decent filler. The way board territories are drawn with ambiguous borders is a minor annoyance.

I like it. Very simple and very quick. Set collection and area control. There's some quirks regarding set types and what actions you'll find on them that'll reward further investigation.

There's nothing much to think about here, but it's a good filler. Generally I'm turning away from games with a lack of a decent theme (if cube pushing I prefer something like 1775: Rebellion), but this one is quick enough that it doesn't outstay its welcome. I wouldn't mind a more complicated version with even harder decisions to make regarding card selection and usage.

From Spirit games. Quick (but not eight minutes) and easy combination of area control and set collection.

Not too bad, although in high player games, there doesn't seem enough moves to fully move your cubes on the board. As happened in a recent 4P game, I was unable to get any movement cards on my opening 4 turns. Thus giving me little opportunity to expand my empire. Whereas another player struggled to get any shipping cards as well.

Sorry, but: No. The game is very unnecessary. It does not deliver theme in any way. It is not really interesting as a quick abstract. Very likely to bring out some analysis paralysis situations. 8 minutes is if you know it by heart, are experienced, don't have to think a lot and play the two player game. Otherwise its in between 20 to 40 minutes, which is too long for what the game does.

El Grande kicsiben, plusz egy kis kártyagyűjtés. A játékosok sorban kártyákat választanak a mindig rendelkezésre álló random jövő hat lapból. Ezekkel egységeket rakhatnak területekre, vehetnek le, mozgathatnak, stb. Plusz a kártyákon egy nyersanyag jel is van, amikből minél többet gyűjtve a játék végén pontok járnak. Egyszerű, akár öten is játszható, tényleg gyors játék. Talán csak az újrajátszhatósági faktorát kérdőjelezném meg, illetve azt, hogy hosszútávon valószínűleg unalmas lehet, de ettől függetlenül nem rossz.

The game actually took us 24 minutes. Still, it's a neat little area-control game. It felt a bit long, but that was just a play with a bunch of newbies; might be a nice filler, actually, although not one I need to own!

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
Players each start with some coins, and a few cubes in one central region of the board. 6 cards are put on display in a row. 

On your turn, pick a card (spending 0-2 coins) and use it (cards slide down to fill empty spot; replenish row). Cards allow you to add cubes (armies) to the board, move armies over land/sea, or build a city. They also provide a resource good: at the end of the game goods are worth points.

After 8 (?) rounds, tally VP:
- 1/controlled region
- 1/controlled continents
- goods (including regions with goods icons): make sets; each type has different value. 
Most VP wins!

RATING: 4
8-minute empire is a 20-minute small area control game.  You read that right.  In this game there is a small map of areas on a few different continents and each player has a small supply of colored cubes and disks.  Each round on their turns players will draft a card from a row (paying more the higher up the row they select from).  The cards depict a good as well as an action.  The actions are placing cubes and disks on the map or moving them.  The goods give points based on set collection at game end and the map gives points based on area control in areas and on continents.

That's it.  There isn't a lot of strategy to employ and by halfway through the game the winner is already pretty obvious.  A sub-par game that doesn't even abide by its namesake gimmick.  Really disappointing since while I haven't really liked all Red Raven games I have liked most of them and haven't disliked any until now.  One of the biggest charms of the games is Ryan Laukat's art and this game has no art in it besides the goods on the cards.

Although it's a bit longer than eight minutes, this is a very quick area majority game. The number of turns is very limited and so are your options. There's not much to agonize over. That's what comes with a stripped-down game, I guess.

RATING: 6
Quick-playing civilisation game with a surprising amount of depth. The object is to spread your influence across the game map in order to gain points for controlling areas. Each turn a number of cards are available for the player to buy and these allow certain actions to be taken e.g. place more armies, move armies, remove opponents armies etc. They also depict a type of resource and these are accumulated for extra victory points at the end of the game. The main strategic decision facing the player is attempting to balance the placement and movement of their armies with acquiring sets of resources, and this is the key to success. For a boardgame playable in around 15 minutes, you'd be hard pressed to find something with as much depth as this.

Ever since I played [thing=123499][/thing], [person=11854][/person] has been on my list of authors to watch. So the chance to play this short area majority game is not something I could pass on. And I'm glad I didn't. This is a small game in a small box with a short rule set. But it packs a punch, for it's size. It has a nice weight with decisions which are worth thinking about. I'm not sure if there's many different strategies to try, but it's a fine little game that should earn a place in many collections.

This would probably lost a rating point for every minute beyond ten that it lasted. There's very little going on here and I'm not sure I really see the point in bidding for turn order when being last seems to be massively beneficial...

For a Kickstarter game, and for a game that lasts about 12 minutes, it's perfectly decent but there's nothing there that would make me seek this out again having played it once.

I don't see a whole lot of fun here.  But it's quick.  Which I guess makes it tolerable.  To streamlined to feel like an 'empire' or area control game, and happens to quick to develop any feelings for your strategy one way or the other.

I'd play it, but not because I really want to, only because it's there, it's fast, and it gets over before looking for another game or waiting for a friend to arrive.

It's a quick strategic filler.  There's area control and set collection.  It's not perfect and there is some randomness in what cards come out and are available... but considering the length it's hard to fault the game.  Given how long it plays, it accomplishes quite a bit.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I will basically post here what I said for [thing=142326][/thing]:

[thing=131366][/thing] is an area control game mixed with set collection. The game is pretty straightforward: in your turn you take one of the cards of the row of six cards. The first card is free, the next two cost 1, the fourth and fifth cost 2 and the sixth, and last, cost 3. Every card has three parts: the bottom part has the action allowed by the card - it will usually be: put armies (cubes) in the board, move armies, take out armies of your opponents or build a fortress. The upper part has the resource type (iron, food, wood, crystal, stone or wild). The middle part has the amount of the resource necessary to score points.

You gain points by controlling territories and regions, and also by the cards that give VPs. After a number of rounds (depending on the number of players) the game ends. The player with the most points, wins!

First of all: the game does not takes only 8 minutes to end. Maybe [i][u]8 minutes per player[/u][/i] - it can be less, but the game will usually last 25-30 minutes do end. It still sits comfortably in the filler section. And a filler with some meat in the bones, for sure. Every turn there are choices: which card to take, how to better use the action. They aren't really difficult decisions, but aren't mindless either - you must consider, ponder about your game and the game of others. [thing=131366][/thing] is a tatical game by nature, but your choices could go from start to finish, since some cards are worth points based in your choices of cards latter on.

As an area control game, [thing=131366][/thing] offers a lot of player interaction, not always in the way of hurting the game of others, but mostly by vying for the same regions or territories. So [thing=131366][/thing] isn't really a game of you do your thing, I do mine, in the end we compare things and see who did better. In here you fight! Sort of.

Replay value seems to be high, since the order of the cards affects the whole game, and also the game comes with two-sided board. The game comes with variants that surely will help to keep the game fresh for longer. But takes this a grain of salt, since I can't really say for sure in this matter.

The game bits are great: the boards are sturdy, the box is just the right size, the card stock is fine. I would like that the chits for coins to be bigger, but I can live with what it got. The manual is well made and clear - it is easy to find informations on it. The artwork in the cards is excellent - Ryan Laukat is really a talented artist.

To sum it up: [thing=131366][/thing] is a solid game, a great filler, with above average components, easy to learn, easy to play, offering a nice set of decisions to be made in such a small frame of time.

RATING: 8
Kickstarted. Funny that I find something so simple to be so intriguing. All the players start with some armies in a common space, and from there colonize the world. Destructive actions are scarce, so this isn't Risk.

What drives the game is a pseudo-auction of action cards: You buy a card (for from 0 to 3 coins) to take the action; anything higher priced slides down a spot and the 3-coin slot gets a new card, so that the cost of a card decreases as players decline to purchase it. This is a great mechanic as it is faster than an auction and doesn't require cards to be balanced in value.

Every card portrays an action as well as one of a handful of resources, and there is a set collection aspect to scoring. I don't care much for this. You can never see the state of the set collection by looking at the board. (This could be a positive thing in making the current leader a little uncertain. Unsure if on the whole it is better to have it though.) Also, the resources don't exist in equal proportions, so each one has its own scoring system. That makes it take quite awhile (considering the length of the actual game) to figure out the final scoring.

It seems to happen frequently that there are no movement cards available, which means players can only stockpile armies in a static position. I'm not sure if this is actually a card mix problem or what. I consider one option, of saying you can use any card as a very weak movement if you want (i.e. move a single army).

...Up to an 8. I stopped using the set collection scoring completely and find it to be a strict improvement as you can quickly calculate everyone's scores. I still think the card mix is weird, but I can play this filler over and over again and always admire the final configuration of the board. Also I have yet to see a market mechanic that works as well as this one. (Though I do like the way the market in If Wishes Were Fishes keeps all money in a closed system.)

...Bought an actual copy and played all the maps. The finished game has some changes to the deck that might make some of my comments obsolete. But set collection aside, the game is about spreading out from the starting location as efficiently as possible, trying not to overlap with other players. I suspect this means the last player is theoretically at a disadvantage, not just because of his position in the initial card draft but because he is last in terms of initiative, which I think is a bigger deal. For instance, if player 1 heads north, the other players would be fools to follow him. So it could happen that the last player has no untrodden paths left to him by the time he gets his first turn. (...Actually, this isn't an issue of being the last player in turn order, but the last player who happens to have the ability to start moving somewhere.)

...Something worth mentioning is that players find themselves in different "phases," where what they really want at a given moment may be movement, sea movement, placement, or city building. This can make the value of cards different based on who would buy it.

Regarding Legends, etc.: This isn't how I would expand the concept. There should be more things that players can do or need to do on the map, not more ways to score points off of cards alone.

I prefer this over the legends version. I think its easier to look at everyone's cards a see what you need to do to affect other players. I think legends is fine but the added abilities of the cards and the addition of scoring the potions turned it into a bit of a crazy point salad game. I think in both by the middle of the game you'll know if you are winning and losing, which is ok since its a short game.

Entertaining euro-style area majority/set collection game that is highly portable and plays in an incredibly short time.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
A CIV-very light game with standard Euro mechanics albeit somewhat truncated for faster gameplay. For example, bid for turn order is only done once and then cards are purchased on a sliding price scale in a clockwise fashion. In another example, permanent special powers aren't that permanent unless you trigger the corresponding action.

I understand the game is trying to be short but game play just comes out feeling unpolished and somewhat constraint. Money is just too tight, thus limiting choices. Movement is too limited and hard to come by for an area majority game. Cost of overseas movement is too severe even with flying, making it hard to challenge for areas and finally, the map feels too limited. 

Perhaps the nature of area majority control games requires a few more rounds to fully flesh out some strategy. As it is, it is too short to pursue anything strategic. Feels rather unsatisfying even as a filler.

Did a couple solo run-throughs with different player counts; liking it a lot so far. Will need to play against actual people before rating. A slick combination of set collection and area control crammed into 15 minutes.

Update: 

A guy on Reddit's boardgaming sub summed up this game perfectly with "There's not enough to make it interesting, but it's too short to complain about." 

It's just OK. I like it better than Rattus as an area control filler, but it's never really a great experience - just meh.  

It sees a lot of play in my group, however, because it fills a nice niche in that it plays five in less than 20 minutes. So despite my mixed feelings toward it, we often end up closing out the night with it.

Update 2: 

8ME: Legends has pretty much replaced this. If I keep this around, it will only be for the possibility of creating some kind of "epic" variant using these player colors and extra boards from Legends.

Nice play on words with the "eight" but more like "48 minute" empire. Actually enjoyed this game but it feels very constricted with the 8 moves, which, I guess, is the point. Also an element of luck involved with the cards that come out in the market. Not a bad filler-ish game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
You can't go wrong with a short, engaging game like this, where all you do on your turn is pick a card and perform the associated action on that card.  There are only two incentives that drive your choices in the game -- sets of symbols at the top of the cards, and the actions at the bottom -- but what you're doing and what others are doing make it more than just a mindless game.  It works surprisingly well, and I can see getting a lot of plays out of this game.

A true micro-game that plays roughly 8 minutes per player, 8ME has players selecting actions on cards and then also collecting symbols on those cards for set scoring at end-game. For a game that mechanises with such efficiency, there are amazing opportunities for strategy and tactics.

Probably the game that teaches players the most skills in the shortest amount of time.

Nice idea, it plays really fast and it is very simple but unfortunately there are several difects: the map is really too small and it gets cramped for room ; if no "build a city" cards come out, everyone is forced to put armies in the Start region and it's a complete mess; probably games are always the same as not much can vary from game to game. 

[EDIT]: after my second play, plus .3 because the game flowed quite well, maybe just because cards were better shuffled, dunno. The shortcoming of the game are still there but i got a better impression this time.

[EDIT]: third play and i had to raise this again. it is actually quite a nice game in its simplicity. Played in 3 you just have to make your best in just 10 moves and there are interesting decisions to take. 7.

Simple and straightforward area majority and set collection game that fits in a travel size box. It does what it's supposed to do, although the title is somewhat misleading. The game isn't over in eight minutes, but rather takes about eight minutes per player. Still, a charming little filler game.

RATING: N/A
Light cube placement area control. Card draft from draw tableau to buy a good or action. Simple actions to move units over land or sea, remove an opponent cube. Collect sets of goods with varied value and score points for occupied regions. A little bland. This could bee a good game to teach light interaction and these basic concepts to newbs.

This is a very light and very quick game about expanding your population across a map so as to become the dominant population in each region and continent while securing resources (some from the map, but mostly through action cards). There is some limited scope for direct conflict, but not much.

Don't need to own, don't need to play. 

Between this and hopscotch, I'll take hopscotch.

Unless it's raining, in which case I'll watch an 8-minute "playful kitten" youtube video instead. They're just so fuzzy and cute.

I enjoyed this one a lot. Choose a card and take the benefits. Do it 7 more times. The money and cost of cards is a very good system.

[COLOR=#0000FF][b]Commentaires Personnel:[/b][/COLOR] J'ai bien apprécié ce petit jeu différent. Bien que je ne crois pas qu'il sera un jour un classique, c'est un petit jeu que je ne refuserai pas de jouer ou de rejouer. Mais attention, il s'agit tout de même d'un "filler". Très bien qu'un joueur de mon groupe le possède, de cette façon, je pourrais y rejouer, mais je n’achèterais pas ce jeu. Bien que si je retrouve l'ancienne version PnP, je pourrais possiblement me laisser tenter de l'imprimer!

[COLOR=#FF0000][b]Comments:[/b][/COLOR] I did liked this little different game. I doubt this one could ever turn to be a classic, but I will never refuse to play it. Don,t get me wrong, it's still only a filler. Someone in my gaming group own's it so I wont go get it, but I could be tempted, if I find the old PnP files to print it.

It's not actually a bad game, it's just not as thrilling as I usually like my games to be. At least it's portable and quick!

Not very excited to play it again honestly.

At first I was a bit let down - the game seemed to play itself. But repeated plays have shown it to create some interesting situations, and taking the play time into account that is very impressive.

Very fast, light area control game. You score points for most influence in a region, then by island. Some cards also score bonus points for matching types. Not a super deep game, but it plays in about 20 minutes - certainly faster than most area control games.

Game outcome significantly influenced by a combination of seating position and opportunities on offer from random card flips. Little control and simple decisions, managing gold appears to be the most important. The saving grace of the game is that it is very short.

Very light, but has an amazing amount of thought process to it. It has a bit of luck depending on what cards happen to be cheaper to buy, but this is negated somewhat by the purchasing mechanic. Very interesting small game.

Probably took more like 12 minutes, but certainly isn't all that involved.  Simple game to close out the night.  Total beer/pretzel experience.

Plays for the fantasy version included here.  The fantasy version is a good deal more fun.

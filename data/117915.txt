I love and hate this game. It is a beautiful game to play. It's probably the best, or at least in the top five, of Euro/worker placement games that we own. And I love the quests aspect where you have to collect certain items in order to complete a quest and gain money, victory points, and other goodies. But I hate the randomness presented with the event deck and never knowing if districts are going to be closed after you've agonizingly planned and executed your strategy to achieve your quest. But maybe that just means I need to peek at the event deck more often.

Well-produced, and some cool mechanics. Unfortunately there is way too much luck factor for a game of this length for my tastes.  You live or die by your mission draws and there is not much mitigation available for this.

Information is powerful in this game, as is flexibility and preparedness. If you want to sit in your corner and optimize your moves, then two things:
1) A computer will always do that better than you.
2) You probably won't win at this game.

It's not random if you know it's coming. Knowing is part of the game. It's a tense, tight struggle to achieve your goals, crowded for sure with five players, but that's where it shines. This is not Lords of Waterdeep.

LIKE: The watchman rotation mechanism is fun to manipulate and threaten other players.

DISLIKE: I did not like the bonus cards, felt they were tacked on. I had a hard time identifying some pictures on the tiles (bad lighting that day). Event randomness is very bad, as a dojo could be wiped out for no reason.

2nd play: The game is too long for the amount of random and backstabbing events it has. Overall, the game doesn't click for me. Rated down.

A good euro but suffers from two problems. Goes on a few turns longer than it really needs to, could easily drop to 8 or 9 from 11. Also, there is a large discrepancy between the values of the black cards and the top scoring cards are very rare. This means if you draw into a good black card you've got a good chance. Willing to play again with an experienced group to see how it goes.

This game is great. It is a game that you complete missions using items and being in certain places, doing this increase your prestige in Edo. The theme of this game is great and the art very beautiful. The theme fits fine with the mechanics and there are lot of interaction between players. I think it is a much better game than Lords of Waterdeep, the game closer in objectives and missions to Yedo I can remember now.

Nice, smooth step up from Lords of Waterdeep as far as complexity and depth of theme.  It's a really beautiful game, and so many components for a good price.  The only downside is it's definitely a long game, whereas Waterdeep doesn't have to be.  I'll play it again with relish, but only if I'm OK with that being the only game I play that night.

Again too heavy for my own collection. The length alone can keep this game off the table for me. But this is everything Lords of waterdeep wanted to be. The weapons you need to collect, make sense for the mission you do. The places you need workers to be, make sense for the mission you do. The buildings you add to your estate, make sense for the mission you do. It is everything I wanted waterdeep to be. Please re-skin to D&D IP.

RATING: 5
Mechanisms are neat. Graphic design is very pretty but borderline illegible in many spots. The game itself is unusually vicious to its players, and although you can prepare (spending actions to view the event deck) it does not feel good to "waste" turns this way. There are lots of things to collect, which feels satisfying but makes the game SEEM far more complicated than it is.

Also, in my mind, resource management games should probably not include screw-your-neighbor cards?

Yedo is surprisingly good, a lot better than I expected, a complex Euro with many decisions and enough interaction between players especially in the meta-game. Coming from Pegasus I expected a 45-minutes light Euro, but Yedo stands tall in its genre. It shows modern mechanisms, it is one of the very few worker placement games where having more workers is not necessarily the way to victory and it is highly thematic. This is the latest trend in Euro-games, they have evolved from dry yet strategic "classics" to games in which the theme is just as important as the maths behind. Yedo is a proud exponent of this new age of worker placement games.

RATING: 6.4
Enjoyable but flawed. The game is reminiscent of Lords of Waterdeep: worker placement in order to gather resources (weapons, money, geisha, etc.) to fulfil the requirements of hidden "mission" cards.

The mark of a good worker placement game is that there are always several enticing - sometimes critical - choices, and you can only choose one. In Yedo, it often seemed like most if not all of the choices were fairly mediocre or unattractive. In the beginning, for example, you can't afford to take advantage of many of the place actions, and later in the game, your requirements might be so specific that your options are limited. 

Part of the problem is that game seems like it could have used more development or playtesting. It's puzzling how some of the actions are almost useless, and I had the constant sense that many of the actions and mission rewards were poorly balanced.

Perhaps the biggest weakness is the amount of luck involved. I like some luck element in games, but here it seemed like too much rested on blind luck of the draw from various decks.

Finally, there are a number of "take that" cards that are irritating if you don't like such things, but in general the "take that" element isn't too bad.

More complex than Lords of Waterdeep, yet the same structure (the vast majority of VP are obtained by accomplishing missions). The game is quite long and doesn't play quite well with two - it can drag to 2 hours and the bidding isn't interesting. I ended up trading this one for Lords of Vegas.

RATING: 5.9
Rating based on two 3-player games.

Absolutely lovely looking game, with lots of flavour, and a gorgeous board (a wee bit too crowded / chaotic / hard to get an overview from, but acceptably so). Although games last a very long time, they don't _feel_ like it, never bogging down, with only a very small amount of time spent on upkeep. I also love the way bidding has been implemented (makes player order very significant).

In the end, though, the reason for this relatively low rating is that games are extremely swingy. There's a lot you could [i]potentially[/i] do to offset and/or recover from 'bad luck' (or other players being vicious), but actually getting your hands on the right cards to do so, depends itself on a lot of luck. The game needs to last at least its full eleven rounds for the luck of the draw to be mostly smoothed out, but even then, someone who through no fault of their own gets smooth sailing in the last few rounds will almost always win from someone who just doesn't manage to find any synergy in the cards. And this ultimately feels extremely frustrating for the player who can't catch a break, while the winner won't feel much of any accomplishment. Might be acceptable for a short game, but not for this much of a time investment. An absolute shame.

People who love Japanese theme and actually enjoy sitting down for 3+ hours for a single game with a very strong luck factor would love this; me, I'm very much not such a person. There's still a lot I like in the game, and I'm glad to have been able to play it, but having done so, there's no way I'd want to own it anymore.

I can't find better words to describe Yedo than "Lords of Waterdeep on steroids".
Yedo is definitely heavier than LoW, with much more options to consider, but they share that "thematic" approach to Euros that adds some value to gameplay and can suck players into the game's world. But where LoW falls short, letting players only feel the need "cubic adventurers" to fulfill missions, Yedo gains a very strong lead: missions are very thematic and you can really feel that your clan is doing some (dirty) work to score secret goals!
The only point in which Yedo is behind LoW is lenght: with 3 more turns (11 vs 8) and many more options (even inside the same placement choice), it lasts a full hour more than its rival... and that is maybe a little too much for such a game.
Anyway, the game is very fun to play, and I can't wait to play it again!

First play: Demo at Essen 2012. Very high production values and lavish artwork. The game structure is complex but logical and iconography is very clear. The build up of resources to fulfill missions is a well trodden path and nothing new however why the designers added a random event deck is baffling. 

Apparently we played with the Samurai deck which contains the harshest results. Some events have an atomic effect on some players zero effect on others. Apparently you can cut these harsh cards out and leave softer, less dramatic consequences but imho such randomness isn't acceptable in the 21st Century and I see no reason to ever play this again.

It's a sad reflection of developments in the games industry over the last few years that opulent artwork and lavish presentation can carry such a weak game mechanic with chaotic randomness to 2000+ owners on BGG. 

Was contacted by the designer to adjust my rating and comment. Denied.

I don’t like either eurogames or Eastern settings yet surprisingly I found Yedo an enjoyable game: I’m sure the key is in the mission cards, that give the game its distinct flavor and the players something concrete to do instead of randomly collecting wooden cubes and grinding victory points as it usually goes with these point salads.

Nonetheless, I feel Yedo still has some issues, such as it lasts too long: eleven turns are too many, even more so since the first half is too slow and all you can do is just trying to get the items you’ll need next to complete the heavier quests. [i](November 2012)[/i]

[b]Update[/b] - One of the goals I set for my Fall 2015 rating revise was to limit half-point ratings to a handful of games: since Yedo isn’t one of those, I rounded down my rating from 6,5 to 6.

RATING: 5
In short; This games takes much too long for what is essentially a fairly simple worker placement/set collection game. I guess why people rate it rather heavy is due to all the little extra rules, the busy board and the various piles of cards and resources.

Explaining this game also takes its time. All the cards, districts, biddings, upkeep, etc. have to be made clear. Most of the rules are simple and make sense, so they're easy to remember. But expect 45 minutes of laying out rules.

Each and every mechanic is borrowed from other games. While that can be said of most games, nothing stands out here. Most game designs have at least a small unique trait, but Yedo not so much.

The artwork is great for the most part, with an exception for the bland bonus and action cards. The board is massive and the player boards, tiles and main board all have a matte finish which is great against reflections. More games should do this.

Finally, for a game that easily takes three hours I don't like how prevalent the luck aspect can be. Synergy between starting missions can jumpstart you ahead of other players. Some event cards can turn out devastating for one or more players hampering their progress and while there are Catan-style trading opportunities, I played a game where a crucial weapon needed for three missions would not appear for multiple turns.

Solid Euro game. We played with the 'light' version, which was definitely not tight enough. Often throughout the game I felt I had too many actions and nothing really good to do. Not a good balance, and so I think playing the 'hard' mode would lift this up a full point. Still, great theme and art, and decent player interaction. Want to try the hard mode to really get an opinion.

09/09: Played advanced version. Not better at all. I can't understand how there can be so few interesting or good choices in a worker placement game. Definitely the mechanics focus on removing choices /progress / satisfaction, rather than enabling them. Which isn't really fun.  Dropping from a 6.5 to a 5.

Virtually the same game as Lords of Waterdeep, yet taking three times as long to play. Throw in crazy random cards that can really throw off one's game. Strange feel that there's really not a lot of good actions to take with your workers in the different districts.

So lacklustre that 4 of the 5 players didn't want to finish our first game.

Update: May 2015 (vs Aug 2013) gave a second chance. 
Raise from 3 to 7

It's a lot better than Lords of Waterdeep. More going on. The 4 player game was much faster.

Third game...some crazy randomness did affect one player who soured on his first game.

Beautiful board and components.  Excellent two-part worker placement/activation mechanic that provides one additional level of strategy.  Points are very tough to come by and Bonus Cards seem to be the key to victory.  I would rate this game even a little higher if not for the long playing time. With 4-5 players, expect to be well over 3 hours if any players are a)inexperienced or b)prone to AP.  Length of game can be shortened by mutual agreement to less than the designed 11 rounds.  Only the length of the game prevents this from hitting our table more frequently.

Yes, this one is far better than Waterdeep, and much more interesting. I love that you have a choice between easy missions that will give you quick cash vs. very difficult ones that will give you lots of points. Money is tight, and sometimes it can be worth selling your VPs for a few Mon if they let you make a big move in a subsequent turn; on the other hand, VPs are also pretty tight, so losing two or three VPs can be a huge disadvantage at game's end. 

The worst part about the game is in the arbitrary action cards and event cards. In our first game, we got an earthquake on the third turn, which made me lose a disciple and an annex, where another player who had still not acquired either of those was not punished at all. I spent the rest of the game playing catch-up, but there was pretty much no hope: that early advantage, basically giving the lucky player two turns over me, meant that she easily strolled her way to victory. My desperate last-ditch move was to go after a different player to squeak out a distant second-place loss (needless to say, that player was not happy with me). I suppose we could play in "Geisha mode" (a sexist and obnoxious term, BTW), but that somehow feels like cheating to me. 

UPDATE: Finally played with "Geisha" mode. Still a stupid name, but a much better way to play. Really like this game, but wish it were 2-3 rounds shorter.

I liked the game, really I did.  However, I have to say that the event deck can be brutal and ruin all of your planning...for several turns!  Between the event deck and the city watch (which basically makes one region unplayable), it felt like you were spinning your wheels at times with no good choices.  With a game that only has 11 turns, that can be devastating.

I loved the theme, art, and most of the mechanics. But there are too many chaotic elements that can ruin your plans. When one undefendable move can cost you 1/3 of your points, it ceases to be fun. I see the great game that's here, it's one I won't likely play again.

A very nice game of being a samurai? I think and trying to complete various missions for money, points and extras that move you forward in the game. Can be very tricky to get missions done but it plays very nicely in a Princes of Florence type way. Auction followed by actions with a bundle of extras thrown on top. 1 Play.

It's contract fulfillment, auctions, and worker placement brought together very well. The game's individual elements are masterfully intertwined and co-dependent, and if you lower yourself into the deep mindset of thinking several turns ahead, the game rewards you with a slew of rewards. I love the theme.

A good worker placement game with a nice theme, but the mechanics of its peers are stronger: Alien Frontiers has more strategies available and Waterdeep has a significant hidden points aspect that leads to tension throughout. A little overlong as well. But a strong theme, beautiful art and still a pretty good game all round!

It's 1) fun! 2) very long. 3) Even with the Geisha variant can still be quite luck driven. Overall an enjoyable experience!

During Summer 2013, Yedo was one of those hyped new games. A lot of times I think the hype is justified (Terra Mystica comes to mind), but this is unfortunately not the case with Yedo. It’s not a bad game, but it’s not a great game either – exactly like my rating shows. Let me explain why I think this is the case.

The major reason Yedo does not get a better rating is length. It takes around 2½-3 hours to play depending on the experience and number of players – and for such a light game (only slightly harder than Lords of Waterdeep), it’s waaay too long! Would you play a game of Lords of Waterdeep which took almost 3 hours? I doubt it. Even 2 hours would be too long, and I only think you can get it played in 1½ hours with 2 players – which is definitely not the right number of players for this game. Yedo would be much better if it ended after 8 rounds instead of 11, but that would obviously mess with the balance of the game, so I don’t recommend to house rule it this way.

Furthermore, it’s a little too random, especially if you play with the Shogun rules as they can screw you over so much you cannot even comprehend it! There is still a lot of luck involved even in the geisha rules; the weapons you draw, the random quest cards (which don’t seem particularly balanced, especially the black ones), the bonus cards and the action cards – you almost always draw from them blindly even though you can take actions to see/manipulate what comes up next. The black quests don’t seem balanced; you can draw some which gives you 3 VPs and other which gives you 10 or 14 VPs (if I remember correctly). This is a very big difference especially as you often just draw the top card. Anyway, the four different difficulties of the quests is a very good idea and one of the things I liked the most. I did notice, however, that the green cards are often espionage, the yellow theft etc., and this is very important to know as some bonus cards refer to this. Furthermore it’s extremely important to know what kind of stuff the black cards need – and I noticed that two of the four annexes are almost always used! This is very important as there is always one annex less than the number of players… The limited amount of annexes and geishas is another good idea as it adds some tension as you cannot be sure if you will get them or not!

Yes, as you can see there are elements of Princes of Florence (the auction and the limited amount of specific items you need), and lots of people have said that it reminds them of Lords of Waterdeep. However, I don’t really mind this, and to be totally honest I don’t think Yedo reminds me much about LoW; yes, it’s a WP game and you complete quests, but that’s basically it… The quests aren’t even completed in the same manner (you need to spend an action doing it), and you need to collect a bunch of different stuff, and you actually keep most of the stuff once you complete the quest. And whereas you can see what the other players need to complete their quests in LoW, in Yedo you have no idea and cannot really block the other players other than by coincidence… There is also a bonus half (which was a very good idea!), so I don’t think “Lords of Waterdeep” on steroids is quite spot on.

Another thing I liked about the game was the auction aspect in the beginning of each round. I liked the auction best with 2 and 3 players as you bid on an entire area and pick afterwards. Personally I think the black spots are too good as they give you 2 VPs each round you win an item there, so you can earn 10-12 VPs throughout the game which is quite a lot. Sure, the other spots are also very good, and an extra worker is almost always handy in WP games! But this is actually where Yedo is different than most other WP games (except for Tzolk’in I think); an extra worker is not always good because of the limited amount of useful spots to activate (and you can also lose the extra workers due to events and because of the watchman). 

The fact that there seemed to be so few good action spots felt a little odd. There often weren’t any meaningful action to take, even with 2 players! It seems like such a crappy action to change the cards compared to other actions! Sure, you can manipulate and take the top card from the deck you have changed the order of, but the other players also know this and might take the card. And it is almost pointless to change the three weapons etc. as all are going to be revealed and available during the next round… The only reason I would ever do it is if I had no other thing to do or if I really needed to know if an item or specific card would be among the top three cards, because then I would be able to place a bid on it during the next auction phase. Still, it doesn’t seem like a good action…
Regarding competition of the spaces, I actually feel that there is less tension in 3 and 4 player games than in 2 player games; in 2 player games there are only 1 space available in some crucial areas, so if you need to have a worker on each space you can get screwed without even being able to do anything about it. It happened to me, and it sucked! I was able to place my workers on the two spaces the turn after, but it delayed me somewhat, and it wasn't even an intentional block.

Two aspects of the game which looked great on paper did not work. The first one was the watchman. In our first game with four, none of us got in trouble and it was very rare that the watchman arrested us because we planned for it and because there aren’t a lot of action cards which moves him forward and mess with your opponents’ plans, which is too bad! I had thought the watchman would be a great mechanic, but in reality he didn’t do much in any of my 3 plays. The second aspect is the trading… It didn’t work, and especially not with 2 or 3 players! Part of it is because you need to be in a specific spot along with the other player you want to trade with, and part of it is because you don’t want to help your opponents too much. Also, as you aren’t allowed to say what the cards you want to trade do, nobody believes anybody (yes, I know you can also trade other stuff like weapons and coins and geishas, but besides weapons that’s often not that interesting). 

The end game bonus scoring wasn’t that big of a deal as you can probably score 12 points maximum or so, but will most likely score a lot less… Still, I have to say that I loved the bonus cards as they added some uncertainty and tension to the final scoring! And speaking of the endgame, the alternative endgame condition (the “kill the shogun” quest) was great! It can really mess with your plans, or even better your opponents’ plans! On the other hand I think it grants you too many VPs considering this fact; nobody but the owner of the card has planned for it, so people can get screwed.

Some final, minor concern about the game is that the board is very big – probably too big as you don’t use half of it, it’s really just flavor… Speaking of flavor; while the art is beautiful, on the other hand it melds with the background and it can be hard to see which actions you can actually make at the various places. Yedo was a decent game, but due to the length vs. the light gameplay it is not a game I would suggest to play all the time.

Lots of cool stuff in this Euro. The mechanics blend into the theme perfectly. The game length is a bit long but it doesn't feel that way while playing, every player is engaged. The random events are annoying initially, perhaps after more plays one can get used to that and find ways to mitigate. Overall, very satisfied with this one.

Yedo is a theme rich game in which you are, primarily, trying to accomplish different missions to gain prestige with the Shogun. To get the necessary requirements to complete missions, clever [b]worker placement[/b] and shrewd [b]bidding[/b] will be required. [b]Hand management[/b] of the various card types (Mission, Action, Bonus), selective [b]card drafting[/b] and [b]set collection[/b] (primarily of your weapons) all need to be carefully balanced to achieve the most prestige. [b]Negotiation[/b] and [b]trading[/b] is required to assist you on your missions.

The designers, Thomas and Wolf, have got to be some of the nicest and most responsive designers here on BGG. But I don't think I would ever want to play games against them because if Yedo is any indication, I think that they would be absolutely ruthless!!

This is my new worker placement standard in which all other games are measured. It is dripping in theme and is loaded with gut-wrenching decisions throughout. When done right, your disciples accomplish missions in a well orchestrated and flowing fashion that makes even the most seasoned gamer's heart skip a beat. If your planning is poor or is interferred with, Yedo can be unforgiving and relentless - it will beat you down like the scum that you are!

My plays have all been Samurai. This is the only way.

If you are in Calgary and are wondering about the upcoming reprint - geekmail me and we shall play!

Complexity for its own sake. Lots of worker placement games with the same theme are better (eg. Edo, Ninjato). Take that opportunities are interesting and plentiful, but the game feels overall repetitive: Collect stuff, do this mission, rinse and repeat. Similar reason I don't like Lords of Waterdeep.

Short version: The Princes of Florence, super-sized, minus the Tetris.

First play. Very enjoyable! The game was a bit long, but didn't really feel like it while playing. You can definitely plan ahead on your turn and be ready to roll. I like the whole thing about getting and completing missions. I also liked different difficulty of the missions. I like the placement of workers happening first, then the resolution when they're peeled off (like Asgard, but not quite as brutal). Money is nice and tight, which is goodness. It's [i]really[/i] hard to get out of a bad position, but I'm ok with that for now. There was some concern about mission difficulty / reward balance, but again, I'm ok for now. Lots to explore here.

When Yedo was announced, I decided to leave it be because of the formidable rulebook. The lavish artwork also rubbed me the wrong way. So if I was going to play Yedo it would have to be explained to me by someone who already knew the game. Quicker than I expected this came to pass; I was genuinely surprised about this.

To me Yedo is like Princes of Florence, but with a worker placement action phase instead of simply two actions. There are some similarities in the bidding phase, there are some similarities in shortage of certain game objects (the Annexes for example look suspiciously like Freedoms), there are similarities in how the Bonus cards function. But there are important differences too. There is no restriction on how great works, in Yedo missions, are completed: if you want simple you get simple, if you want difficult there is difficult. There are random event cards to spice up the proceedings. There is screwage with targetted action cards. There is some trade. There is worker placement. But still I found it helped considerably to think of Yedo's action flow in terms of PoF's. It also turned out that once you understand the various iconography, the game is actually surprisingly simple to play given the amount of 'stuff': Collect various things through bidding, purchases and trade; and use these to complete missions which net you points and money and some other cool bits. Bidding is done on most of the material; next a worker placement phase ensues for several other goods and conversions which is resolved; next round. And after 11 rounds, the player with the most points wins.

The first few rounds went by quickly, and I found I even liked Yedo more than I thought I would. The turn structure is clear, there are obvious advantages to bidding for one or the other object; and reading through the missions provided a short humoristic diversion (more on that later). But then we ran into some nasty event cards which dealt out screwage randomly. You could lose entire placement turns that way which is not fun. I also ran into a problem of becoming stuck on missions for which I needed weapons which just did not appear in the draw stack despite massive digging and prescience; and the only player with whom I could trade wanted a weapon in return [i]I[/i] was the only owner of. Ergo: trade was not a success under these circumstances. And then Yedo becomes long, frustrating, and not at all that pleasant. It would seem that the intent of the game is simply to go with the flow and just discard missions and weapons in the hope that the next will be better... But it is obvious that someone who is lucky to draw everything in combination will have an advantage that way which cannot be overcome save by unsatisfactory locking out in case something [i]does[/i] go awry ('You are nicely in the lead and want a weapon? You pay, and pay [i]lots[/i].'). I was surprised to see this design decision appear in a design of this day and age: it's simply not as good as can be, and in this game with some precise other mechanisms it feels 'off'.

The artwork is lavish to the point of unclarity. The board itself is also very big, and very little cardboard estate is actually used by the players: it is mostly flavour and 'thematic immersion'. I admit I liked some of the deadpan mission phrasings: kidnapping the apparently poor but in reality rich merchant's daughter is presented as a cool and easy way to cash, almost like finding a bank which offers a high interest to all who make a deposit there; and the card where I had to steal Geisha X's slippers had me secretly replacing 'slippers' with 'worn undergartments for your master's delectation' which amounted to the same thing, really. But Yedo is so obviously euro through and through that the combination feels somewhat strained. It could have worked had the Japanese background been allowed to become a little less pervasive by taking back a step or two; currently it's a bit too much.

All in all I think that with some more work Yedo might have become a fairly accessible game of Japanese scheming in the samurai-ages, and that the game itself although not ever stellar, would at least offered quite a clean bidding/placement-environment. My current opinion is that it misses out on both in a small number, but still crucial areas. Not by much, but still in ways which are hard to miss. If someone brings it to the table I'll play again, but currently I'm not going to seek out the game actively.

LD. But text is non-essential. Great looking game, nice components. Similar to Lords of Waterdeep, but with more strategy and choices and therefore longer to play.

I must admit i am not that much of a boardgame fanatic, even more,  I rarely play one due to a lack of time, or even better, other priorities. Call me a newbie.  When  I was confronted with the rules and the complexity of all different phases in this Yedo game I wondered  if my freetime shouldn’t have been spend in a better, more constructive way,  without relying  on full  brain activity in a glorious attempt to obtain victory. But nevertheless, the game was on and after a few rounds (well maybe 2) of Yedo I was really into the game, or better,  I couldn’t get out of Yedo anymore,even my brains didn’t protest.  A variety of level in missions, different actions and events, bidding, … in all its diversity the game went on smoothly and it was really fun playing. It’s strategy yes, but also a bit of luck, smarting out opponents and living on hope. Playing the game, 3 hours seemed to have passed away without any notice of time. Maybe boardgames are a lot of fun after all, Yedo guaranteed a nice and amusing evening  and even encouraged my  boardgame enthusiasm again.

I really liked the theme.  I really liked the mechanics of the game.  It had a lot of potential.  

The problems started in about round 3, it became obvious to all of us that the game is very similar to many games being churned out the last few years, it isn't actually play tested.  I think many games may be tested by the designer and their social group, but not by groups of objective and critical players, and this is a glaring example of that trend.  

If the theme were kept and all of the numbers/cards/spaces reworked completely for balance, you would have something amazing.  Instead you have a bunch of randomness piled onto variance with a little bit of luck mixed in, with absolutely no semblance of balance.

very disappointing because it had so much potential.

Good theme, in the well written backstory to missions, and the fact that mission requirements match the mission description (eg a kidnap mission require rope and be in the location of the victim).  Board and art are nice but icons are not that easy to see and a little small.  Player interaction is less than we hoped.  Enjoy playing this, but it's longer than some other similar games so tHis might not make the table as much as others.

I upped my rating from a 9 to a 10 because I will probably always want to play this game.  It's really an easy 10 for me.

I remember being concerned initially with potential AP among players.  But that is only the case with the players who get AP in everything.  It doesn't induce more than any other game I know of.

It's certainly a long game, but there is plenty of short-term satisfaction in each action you're able to accomplish, especially in missions.  The missions are far more gratifying than those in say...Lords of Waterdeep.  Each action is meaningful and can be tied thematically to your mission.

Players assume the roles of Clan Elders in the city of Edo during the early years of the Tokugawa Shogunate. The object of the game is to amass Prestige Points, mainly by completing missions. To do so, players must gather the necessary assets and – most importantly – outfox their opponents and prevent them from completing their missions.

RATING: 5
Could have been a great game, but is marred by punishingly random events. Normally, this wouldn't be too bad, but in a game this long (our 4-er lasted about 3.5 hours including teaching) it's just too frustrating. I really am surprised those events made it through playtesting. 

It seems the designer(s) tried to make the game punishing, but in doing so, made it frustrating in the process. I don't mind the watchman making it risky for players to place disciples in a region, but the screwage from manipulating his movement is just too harsh as well. And add to that that your disciples (beyond 2) are not just returned without doing the action, but are lost!

Apparently, you can play this game without the event cards (or, I can see even customizing the event deck). In that case, the game would be MUCH better, but would still run quite long for what it is. However, I'd be much more inclined to play it sans event cards.

The rest of the game is pretty good though. I see the similarities to Princes of Florence, as others say. In fact, it's a fair step above PoF in terms of theme at least.

Longer and more complex than Lords of Waterdeep, but it really does have a lot in common. The biggest difference is the trading phase, more random hidden scoring, and the loss of potential workers.

That being said, the game is tightly designed because a lot of missions are worth a similar amount of things. There is a hidden resource management game in here.

I want to rate this higher as the theme and gameplay are honestly worthy of an 8 or more but I don't know how I feel about the events and the watchmen. I'm not sure how common it is but in our first game, we had areas of the board inaccessible for 5 out of 11 rounds and that was not including Guard movement. Maybe that could have been some unlucky draws but it just really hamstrung some players

very strategy game.

I played this  game with 3 people. 
that is 4 players game. Samurai Version.

This game is very intersting. 
this game has so many options to be able to select. 

almost very good.

disadvantages: 
1.11 rounds are kind of long. 8~9 round is enough.
2.too many text to read (4 players must read English)
3.Borad doesn't have any English text to show location
eg: tavern, market etc only Chines character.

and then building and Geisha bidding phases have very strong position.
reason: +2 points is very strong.
In my opinion, if all buildings and Geishas are deplete, they has to give +2 points.

4.Bonus card is only acquired at Bidding Phase.
In my opinion, any Board location has ability of exchange existing bonus card with card on top bonus card deck.


5.Green Mission cards are needed more.
very soon deplete

Total evaluation:
very good game !!!
You can enjoy this game without knowing of time flowing.
I recommand this game very strongingly.

My biggest complaint is lack of variety in what you can do, meaning that replayability is not going to be good. The actions are completely static (unlike its "sister game", Lords of Waterdeep, where the buildings which come into play are different every time so the actions are different every time.)

The other big complaint is that this game is really long, but that many extremely random elements have a major effect on the game's outcome. It's not at all unlikely to have all your planning utterly derailed with no hope of recovery (or to receive massive benefits from favorable card draws, so much that your victory becomes all but assured). For such a long, brain-burning game, all this randomness makes the high level of effort expended seem a little pointless.

The components of the game are excellent. The board, in particular, is huge and gorgeous. The mission cards are very large and wonderfully done. The flavor text is also top-notch (but really only entertaining for a read or two.)

Ultimately, I expected this one to fire Lords of Waterdeep. Now I'm thinking I'll probably get rid of this one and get the expansion for Lords of Waterdeep instead.

I had a hard time rating this game. On the surface it is a really good game and I enjoyed playing it. After further reflection, it has some flaws that turn a really good game into just an ok game:
It's too long. Eight rounds would have been plenty. 
Getting blocked out of actions you really need can hurt badly. 
There is more luck than I usually like with a game of this length. Lucky players will win other things being equal. 
There isn't a great catch up mechanic. 
Like I said, a good game but not a great one.

[2013-12-02 Rating: n.a. -> 5.5]
I'm having a hard time coming up with a rating for Yedo. I bought it because of Rahdo's great walkthrough, already seeing there that Yedo features some mechanisms that I don't particularly like. Namely that would be the action cards which introduce some nasty 'take that' elements and a whole lot of uncertainty caused by the fact that a lot of the things you get (like missions, actions cards and weapons) are unknown to you if you don't take the appropriate steps to 'foresee the future'. Another thing I wasn't certain about was the long play time since in this day and age my gaming time seems to be rather limited. 

After playing Yedo, most of my concerns remain valid. I'm quite certain that Yedo has some built-in mechanisms that allow you to minimize the influence of the luck of the draw albeit I don't think that it is possible to eliminate it completely. This is something I would be fine with if the game would be shorter. I do really like games with risk management but in a game this long which has no built-in catch up mechanism, it can really sour your experience. It happenend to me when I took a gamble in an early round and did only draw missions that required a certain weapon that just wouldn't come up round after round anymore. Unfortunately, it took me too long to change my plans and so I was out of the competition quite early.

I guess, with further plays I would be able to compensate bad draws up to a certain point and could avoid making such mistakes. But I'm just not sure if I do want to invest the needed amount of time to get to this point. Especially since I think that a random attack or some lucky card draw can still ruin your chances of winning no matter how much you prepared yourself. I guess, I just miss the ability to plan ahead. Currently, I'm not going to seek out the game actively but I will play it if someone brings it to the table.

Two small things I didn't like about Yedo's graphical presentation were the board and the color coding of the annexes. While the board looks nice, it's just difficult to read. The icons meld with the background making it hard to see which actions are still available. Regarding the annexes, why did they choose brown and red as the frame color? They are just to similar under bad lighting conditions.

[2014-04-22 Rating: 5.5 -> 6]
My last rating was between a 5 and 6. After giving Yedo another try, I decided to up it to a 6. Maybe it was because I haven't had that much time to play games in the last few months (who knew that the birth of a child could do this :)) and so I was starving to get a game to the table, but this time I enjoyed Yedo more. I took a more relaxed approach and didn't mind the randomness that much. Heck, like I thought in my last comment, I even found some ways to mitgate it. Still, because of the long play time I won't actively seek it out but I wouldn't mind another play or two.

Someone described it as "Lords of Waterdeep on steroids".  I can kind of see that.   The missions and long term goals around missions are similar, but there's definately a lot more going on and lot more negative effects to deal with in this than Waterdeep.  The theme and components are stunning, but it does run a little long.  I didn't think the events were nearly as bad as people made them out to be, although we did play Geisha level in our first game.

RATING: 3
As the designer asked me to provide some insight on my rating here it is. Take it with a grain of salt as I only played the game once with three people.

My 3 translates into: 
"Likely won't play this again although could be convinced. Bad."

The game feels random to me to the point where it is pure chance. One of the three cards you can choose from fits or it doesn't. That's it. This randomness multiplies with the effects of the bonus cards for endgame scoring. You might argue that with more plays you will be able to control the randomness as you know what is coming up next but with 11 boring rounds of the same and a playtime of 3h there won't be any more plays for me.

Though this game has a gorgeous board by Franz Vohwinkel, the game itself felt a bit dry and mechanical to me. It didn't really have any new mechanisms that impressed me in any way.

RATING: 7
Players are a family, running around medieval Japan, completing missions for glory.  Players run through 11 turns, with every turn reading like a check list of typical Euro game mechanics.  We have auctions, trade phases, worker placement, and so on.  The good thing is it all feels very familiar, indeed for this Princes of Florence veteran found the auction portion of the game almost a carbon copy.  

The rest of the game involves visiting the seven locations in Edo and either taking actions there, or completing missions.  The missions come in four levels of difficulty, and are divided not four thematic groups - warfare, theft, etc.  Completed missions are a source of victory points as well as the ever needed cash.  

Despite the lengthy rulebook and learning curve, this is a well designed game that looks absolutely glorious.  There is a large chunk of chaos in the game, foiling the perfect plan brigade, but this can be mitigated by playing the Geisha version of the game, rather than the full Samurai game.  

Good fun.

just because its 'new' and 'shiny' doesnt mean its a good game.. another 'cult-of-the-new' fan favorite that really a big disappointment with cumbersome mechanics.. should be playtested more before release.. 

Bought on a whim based on lot of recommendation and sold it in less than a week because of the disappointment.

*edit: i stand by my rating even when the game creator asked me to increase the rating. The personal request via mail from the designer to increase rating also add salt to the wounds because i suspect everyone who rate this game as 1 will be influenced to increase its rating because of the mail..

A really tactical game. First impression is that everybody plays on his own. But the more you play it, the more you realize that the worker placement is really important and sometimes it's more important to control the possibilities of your opponent instead of completing your next mission.

Thanks to the different missions, the replayability is limitless. Based on your starting missions it is important to decide on your strategy during the game.

Great game.

Great worker placement game that adds a fun auction mechanic at the beginning of each turn. Can get pretty brutal at the samurai level difficulty, some of the random events can screw you over pretty bad. It plays a little better at the geisha level, it's not quite as brutal or random.

RATING: 7.5
A delightfully-brutal take on the worker placement category that is low on points and high on tension.  A bit long in the tooth, but ultimately less an optimization exercise (which I hate) and more of a long-game-planner (which I enjoy).

I normally do not enjoy most worker placement games when they are delivered with standard fare (place, get points, move on), but Yedo (not to be confused with Edo) is a different beast altogether.  One of the key elements here is that everyone gets to activate one worker at a time instead of their whole lot, and another key element here is that activation is the very last step.  There is an intermediary phase between when you put your people down and when you pick them up, placing them at risk of actually being lost to you or having the board change after you've committed to spaces (forcing you into actions you didn't want to do).

When I say "delightfully-brutal", this is the kind of thing I mean.  You also have an event deck that is lightly peppered with good stuff, but mostly populated with bad stuff.  High-powered, yet hard-to-get action cards also turn the table upside-down, usually when you absolutely cannot afford to have it do so.  I love it.

For the vanilla Eurogamer, Yedo can be a frustrating experience because the game and other players are really out to get you.  While there's no direct confrontation, combat rolls, or anything of the sort, there are ways to manipulate the board (which has rotating resources, for example, and a patrolling watchman who will arrest your workers) not necessarily in your favor, but to another player's detriment.  While that may sound terrible to your typical "let's all just get along" gamer, there is an intense need to get up in someone else's business and it somewhat plays into the theme of Japanese shadow agents running around getting some intrigue done - basically, the points race is TIGHT unless you let someone get away with murder.  If you're not mucking with other folks at the table, you're going to find yourself trailing behind.  Oh, and the event deck?  Forget about it.  That thing is going to collapse your intricate plans before you've even made them.

To me, this is an absolute joy in this kind of game.  Here you have a game that relies on you to keep focused on your long-game, but it is constantly trying to mess with that long-game.  You cannot get so hyperfocused that you sit out of the game for more than a couple of rounds.  The key to this game is completing missions and the meat of play involves ensuring you have the resources and requirements needed to get them done.  With four difficulty levels of missions, by the time you're in mid-game, people are working on much more complex things, and resources, money, and workers are limited.

Yedo is less about not-getting-everything-done and a lot more about just-getting-SOMETHING-done and hopefully the game won't confound your longest plan to get that black mission card under your belt.  It hinges and swings on your ability to be adaptable and to put yourself in a good position to either protect your stuff or ensure you're never in harm's way.  It's not really perfect information, but it is a game about intrigue, after all.

Definitely worth checking out!

My impression from a 5-player game: Random event cards and cruel take-that action cards derail this game.  It's not fun to spend the game working toward a goal and then have the rug pulled out from under your feet from a single card play.  On a positive note: the artwork is beautiful.  Great theme too.

RATING: 8
Oh man this game is great!  It's cardboard proof that truly thematic Euros can be made.  Its unlike any worker placement game I've played.  I think it kind of stinks that it's compared to Lords of Waterdeep because the gameplay has a much different feel to it.  Maybe I'm just a soft touch when it comes to worker placement games.  I haven't met many I didn't like (although I haven't met many I've kept either). I don't know...

Anyway, Yedo is all about building up your house and sending your disciples out into the city to complete missions.  The points in Yedo are really hard to get and you can really get screwed as competition for action spaces is really tight.  

I also love how you can build up your house and pull off a monster chain of mission completions in one turn.  Careful planning is highly rewarded here.  This game is awesome!

2012-11-04 : Played it twice now and I like it - it's got a correct amount of luck and everyone is pretty much either interacting or trying to figure out his move(s) all the time, so very little downtime. Points can be made in various ways which is a plus as well. Another plus is the great UI, the back page of the rules and the board pretty much explain the entire game.

Third play and a problem emerged that a player (or 2 in our case) can get completely stuck early on due to bad luck with the missions. I wonder if some of the more useless actions (like looking at and stacking the top 3 cards in a particular deck) could not better be used for drawing extra cards. Especially in the "weapons" area.

Worker placement that kinda reminds me of Lords of Waterdeep with a mix of dungeon keeper because the events can be ruthless and destroy your strategy. Its a fun game to bring to the table occasionally when you have 2.5 hours to burn.

RATING: 6.5
Enjoyed my one play. More thematic than most Euros and I liked the twist on worker placement, that is, that a placed worker can be used to gather resources or complete missions and one or more workers need to be a certain locations to accomplish these missions.

I did feel the game went a little long and at times, it felt there wasn't as much to do as others...

Need another play to determine if this sits in the 7 range or if it will be something I may potentially trade.

Great theme, amazing mission cards, and very smooth flow from round to round. This game has so many great details from the beautiful game board and the oversized mission cards, to the flavor text on the mission cards themselves and what you need to complete each of them. Win or lose, I really like looking through all of the missions I've completed at the end of the game to see what my clan has achieved. I normally don't like bidding systems in games but the way Yedo handles it is fantastic. It's quick, fun, at times tense, and compliments the game instead of being a focus of the game. The mission cards create a great dynamic where you never know where your opponents will need to place their workers and why they are going to each district.

Perhaps one of the most beautiful games I've seen.  Great theme, love the worker placement, coupled with an auction.  There's a lot of interaction and limited spaces on the board, but a lot of the spaces are pretty uninteresting.  A lot of people hate the random event cards. And I can see why. But I enjoy playing with them but without the samurai cards. They are two significant of a game changer.  If I'm going to complete a mission like "killing the shogun", I could spend several turns collecting everything I need to complete this mission which will bring about the end of the game and score a buttload of points.   And one bad event card could ruin everything I've been building up to, and essentially throw the game... Well that is frustrating, it typically impacts everybody on the board however it often impact some more than others.

RATING: 9
We found that once everyone knows the game it moves along pretty quickly.  With 2, whilst there's less auctioning and trading, it's still tight and the focus is on how to leverage relatively few moves to maximise points.  The changing order of the (mission, action, event and bonus) cards provides variable play conditions even with two.  

I played once when the event deck was edited to exclude the harsher cards, and another time when it was excluded entirely (by the person who was teaching to first-time players).

45w5.

[b]Rating based on - 8 plays, 2 player[/b]
Yedo is a fun, thematic Euro (auctions, worker placement, and hand management with a dash of set collection) that is strategic yet exciting to play. The only thing that keeps it from hitting the table more often is that it is LONG, but we try to get it to the table at least once a month. 

We always play on Samurai level now. Randomness happens in life, and it adds an extra element to mess up your plans  in the 2 player game especially (other than your opponent). It can be frustrating when every mission you have requires entirely different sets of weapons to complete, but I love having secret objectives in games so then it becomes a time pressure puzzle to figure out how to get everything done in only 11 rounds. I would like more mission cards though. Even in as few games as we've played, we seem to have the same missions turn up quite regularly. It's very satisfying when you complete an especially difficult mission having had to dodge the Watch Patrol, survive earthquakes and tsunamis not to mention navigate through the inaccessable districts...

I first saw this being played at Gaelcon 2013 and had to have it, due to a combination of theme, graphics and the worker placement mechanic. I've played one game so far and thoroughly enjoyed it.

The closest point of reference for me is Lords of Waterdeep for mechanical and thematic reasons, but there are some important distinctions: Yedo is a little more aggressive, the night watchmen mechanic adds a touch of semi-predicatable danger and Yedo lacks LoW's buildings mechanic so the board is less variable.

2014 is bound to see a few more plays of this.

A version of Lords Of Waterdeep, again with worker placement covering for choice denial, and getting stuff to fulfill missions. I found it a little fiddly (WHY DO GAMES HAVE SUCH BLOODY TINY ICONS!!), I got confused with some of the symbols and slightly frustrated. But overall, it was enjoyable and my next game will be a lot quicker. many of the actions turned out to be pointless or futile under the circumstances. In particular, the game board is way over sized and the background graphic way too detailed and makes the action symbols harder to spot. But over all, on balance, it's a nice enough modern game, very much in vogue, but almost no interaction beyond a teeny bit of screwage and some tension over timing of actions.

only one play.  It was heavier than LOW.  Theme was okay flavor text helps out a lot but still fairly weak on theme.   Lots of choices and decisions to make.  I enjoy the overall actions portions and the auction is interesting. 

However the randomness of cards is too swingy and too much take that in a game that is this long. Yes there is some mitigation in some actions.  It still is too brutal for what it is.  The game length is brutal and does not benefit from the wild swingyness from bonus, action, weapons, and quests.  Too many random elements and the events can hose a player's actions.  Where in some cases rich get richer.  Sometimes there is a catch up mechanic and sometimes another players actions could mess up ur entire turn.  Again in an 1-2 hour game that would not be a huge concern.  But this game's length is easily 3-4 hour minimum.  

I'm a player who does not mind some risk or chance it was just too many I feel that ruins the experience.  In the end was the game fun or satisfying?No I rather be playing LOW which offers the same experience for a third of the time.

Looks amazing, great fun, but a little long.  

It's obviously going to draw comparisons to Lords of Waterdeep as the core mechanism is much the same. However it's a much deeper game and plays over more than double the number of rounds leading to a significantly extended playtime - our 3 player games took around 2.5 - 3 hours.  I'd expect a 5 player game to take nearer 3.5 hours.  It remains to be seen if this can be brought down to a more manageable length as the rules and understanding of the game improve.

Nagyon nagy csalódás számomra ez a játék. Nagyon jókat hallottam róla mindenkitől, de nekem nagyon nem tetszett. Tudom, hogy minden nyersanyag menedzselős játék valahol ugynaerről szól, de nagyon az arcunkba van tolva, hogy most három bigyuszt és négy izét váltsál át három pontra és két pénzre. Ez már eleve érdektelenné teszi. Ezt súlyosbítja az, hogy küldetések láncban teljesítése nélkül olyan pénzhiányba kerülsz, hogy semmit se tudsz csinálni. Ráadásul a tábla tele van értelmetlen pszeudóakciókkal. Mi értelme van minedn paklinak berendezgetni a felső három lapját. Csak ha lenne rá húzóakciód, de ez aránylag ritka. A design is szerencsétlen, totálisan átláthatatlan a tábla, mert minden akció beleolvad a környezetébe és még kicsit nehezítendő random helyekre is vannak lepötyögtetve. . Szerencsére csak 8 köröset játszottunk, el nem tudom képzelni, mit lehet ezen 11 körig csinálni, mikor mindig tök ugyanaz történik.

In more than one way, Yedo is clearly a crossbreed between Princes of Florence and Lords of Waterdeep. That doesn't necessarily mean that is is entirely derivative, though. In fact, I might like the basic framework a little more than either of its progenitors despite it being rather plain and a little on the long side (made somewhat worse by using variable player order).

There are, however, a couple of points that severely mar that good initial impression. The most important is that for me it is pretty much unacceptable that a game of this length (expect roughly 3 hours with a table of 4 or 5) is decided by completely random and arbitrary events in the final 15 minutes. This issue is much more prominent in the Samurai setting, obviously, but even in the Geisha setting drawing the right mission cards or being targeted by some of the offensive action cards can make a huge difference towards the end.

Turns out I'd rather play Princes of Florence or Lords of Waterdeep after all.

Versteigerung, WP, Missionskarten mit unterschiedlichen Schwierigkeitsgraden, Mangelwirtschaft - obwohl YEDO ausschliesslich bekannte Elemente verbaut und über 11 Spielrunden üppig dauert, bleibt das Spiel stets spannend, kribbelnd, abenteuerlich. Das Spielgefühl mäandert zwischen Wunschdenken, Klemmigkeit, Mangel, Erfolgserlebnissen und ärgerlicher Schicksalhaftigkeit und lässt darin dem Spieler Raum, um sich mit Plan und Geschick bei gleichzeitigem Kontrollverlust durch Ereigniskarten, die wie Blutgrätschen dazwischen gehen und einem die Runde verhunzen können, sich in einem durchaus thematischen Spiel im alten Japan selbst zu erleben und zu erproben.

I like this game. The mission completion mechanic that it shares with Lords of Waterdeep is something that I find really engaging. Yedo is a bit deeper than Lords of Waterdeep, but that depth comes at the cost of being a longer game.

I think I actually prefer Lords of Waterdeep mostly because of the shorter playtime, but partly because I also tend to prefer games that are less deep at this point. 

Yedo is still one I hope to play again in the future, and may actually end up in my collection due to the theme.

Conveys theme better than LOW, thereby more satisfying. The game board is a visual feast, if not a bit too busy. There is some joy in trying to accomplish the missions while being able to trade with others- all while keeping an eye out on your opponents, preventing them from doing the same, and blocking them by using the guards. But in the end, the game lasts far too long for what it is, and boredom sets in around the 1/2 way point. You can shorten the game, but then it's not the same & not worthwhile. If we're investing 3 hours into a game, there are others to play.

Excellent game.  I like Lords of Waterdeep, and I was told this was like Waterdeep Plus.  That's a good assessment as this game shares some mechanics with Waterdeep (the drawing of quests that must be completed) but there is also more to it in terms of mechanics and options.  I like that all players' quests are secret, so that you have to be more observant if you're going to try to anticipate another player's moves - it's not all spelled out for you in terms of what items the others need.  I also like the bidding and trade mechanisms.  The theming is fun as well, and the quests are pretty clever!

Way, way, way too long for what it is.  Other worker placement games are more streamlined and have more meaningful decision-making. Spending about 3 hours to have a game decided by random events is one possible outcome you might face. If the game was enjoyable, that could very possibly be forgiven, but as it is, the game is repetitive and not especially engaging. Have zero desire to play this again, and wish I could have the 3 hours I spent on it back.

By the way, I find it amusing the designer is seemingly asking people who give this game low ratings to raise their ratings. Note to designer: You can spare yourself the effort in my case.  What you see in this comment says it all.

Lords of Waterdeep "heavy". Play is very similar - collect resources to complete missions which give VP and bonus resources, bonus cards (think Lord cards) give end of game bonus VP. Add in some action cards (like Intrigue cards but potentially more impactful) and an auction phase for additional resources at the beginning of each round.

Then add an Event card phase and potentially destroy all your hard laid plans - this is the CON from our point of view - the game play is quite long to have a random event potentially majorly impact your plans.

All the bits are very good although the board is much bigger than needed and very brightly coloured and detailed which makes reading the icons more difficult than necessary.

The rules are very well written.

Superior to Lords of Waterdeep.  One of the best worker placement games out there.  Sure it takes a little while to play (2-3 hours), but this game requires some thinking ahead, and adapting to bad situations.  You have to work for those prestige points, as opposed to finding the right combination of quest/mission wins to create some sort of point/money/card combo (though it is possible for this to happen, but it requires more timing and strategy than LoWD to pull off, and it's a gamble trying to pull off those combos, making it all the more sweeter if you manage to do so).

Wow, fantastic game!  And best rulebook ever.  So clear, so concise.  Perfect.  My wife and I fell in love with this game halfway through our first play.  For her to say "Okay, I get it now, and I like this game." on her first play is enormous praise.  She HATES learning new games, but this one just makes so much sense.  So well designed.  Very very smooth with a lot of tough choices.  I'd love to try a 5p game.

UPDATE: I've played a few more 2p games and last night seemed like the game really came into its own for me.  My wife struggled each round with the multiple layers of planning, gathering the right gear in the right order, scheduling her worker assignments in the right order, paying attention to the city watch, and activating in the right order.  Where she grew frustrated, I grew more and more interested.  After the game we sat and talked about the experience a bit more.  It seems like there are some games out there that we just aren't smart enough to play.  Trying to play them just makes us feel dumb and we can't overcome the challenge so it's not fun to be frustrated the entire time.  Some games are too easy where they don't require enough thought and we end up bored.  And some games flirt with the edge.  This is just such a game.  It seems like it's always asking you to think about one thing too many, if I only planned for *one more thing* I would've succeeded in that round.  It feels very carrot-on-a-stick where it's encouraging me to get better at it and I'm feeling more and more motivated to keep trying.  Whatever this is, it feels fun to me.  My wife seems to be a little further down the scale of difficulty than me, so her edge might be a degree or two easier, but she's reserving her opinion of the game for a few more plays.  Overall I really really like this game.  It feels fun and cool and each mission is its own puzzle to solve.

UPDATE AGAIN:  My wife and I played again lastnight.  I crushed her.  This was the first time we had such different experiences in a single game.  Where I was completing quests (11 in total) she only managed to complete 4.  She had a 5-round string of bad luck.  The City Watch was in the wrong spot, she didn't have an action card to control him, an event made the district she needed inaccessible, I took the one spot she needed, or I played an action card and moved the city watch to arrest her.  I had fun in that I was firing on all cylinders, but I didn't have fun because my wife was unhappy.  We tend to "play nice" and despite her trading in mission cards for new missions, she never got anything remotely compatible with the weapons she had.  At what point should you abandon everything and start over?  :P  All that being said, she was only 10 or so points behind me at game's end, so it's obvious that scoring in the game is very tight.  It was just a bit of a downer that she didn't have a good time.  I think this is true to the spirit of the game, though.  We're *competing* clans and every bad thing that happened to her was anchored in a thematic context.  Of course our carefully laid plans might not work out due to unforseen events.  Of course the events happen *after* we've made our plans.  Of course we're going to bump into each other in worker placement....that's the whole point of worker placement :P  There's never going to be enough room.  And of course I should play the card that moves the city watch one extra spot to skip over me and arrest her instead.  It's just that it ALL happened to her the entire game.  In 5 games this is the most bad luck any player has ever had.  I really love this game, but we're new to player conflict and interaction.  It's just taking us a little adjusting to accept the right competitive mindset.  I'm going to ask my 3 brothers to play... we have zero problem beating each other up.  I think this will be a big hit with them.  :)

UPDATE: I've played a few more times and notice the unfortunate train wreck some players can fall into where fate, events, the city watch, or someone's action card can just negate multiple rounds of planning and preparation.  Each time this has shown to be debilitating and they never really recover from the hit. The emotion this creates at the table isn't one I care to have for anyone on game night.  When this train wreck happened to me, it just solidified my desire to trade/sell the game away.

I've only played this game once and it's already one of my favourite games. This is a big-boxed game with great value if you count everything inside. The board is a lot to take in at first, but once you get down the actions of each area, things start to look less busy.

I love the fact that it's mission based and how I have the control of choosing the difficulty of my missions. Game sessions are at least 1.5 hours depending on the determination of your missions. This is definitely an underrated game and everyone should be promoting it.

I hate clones. Particularly not so good games like Lords of Waterdeep which is for me an incomplete or should I say 50% of what it should have been. (Edit: Was the other way around LoW is a clone of Yedo. Didn't check the dates. :/ The game is a bit better than LoW, but not that good.)

People should create their own games, not copy other's, especially crappy ones. (Edit: LoW, not Yedo)

If you didn't find Lords of Waterdeep fun, don't even try this one, it's pretty much the same but a bit more complex. It has limited replayability also, but more than LoW.

EDIT: To add to the wrong comments, not that the game is unplayable, or not entertaining, or badly made. To my taste, it is just a matter of depth and replayability... the two things I think are the most important in a game.

If someone gave me this game, I wouldn't throw it away, you can still enjoy this one... unlike Lords of Waterdeep... note the difference between the two ratings I give the two games (this one is blue the other is red or pink I think. ;) )

I can see why it is often compared to The Manhattan Project and Lords of Waterdeep, but I don't think I would rather play it.  I disagree that the theme comes through.

So the mechanics are pretty solid, and based on a reading of the rules and what you read you get a bit worried about the event cards. And then you play the game, and discover that the events are relatively fine, but every other deck (of which there are several) are wildly imbalanced and out of whack. It's almost comical how little thought there was to how the disparity in event, bonus, and mission cards would affect the game. Who wants to play a 3 hour euro game where there is so much random nonsense? Apparently many people, but I don't know what they've been smoking.

RATING: 6
Nice game with a nice theme. Reminds me a bit of "Princes of Florence", but in a heavier, longer way, even though it's not really a heavy or complicated game.

I would like it more if it would take less time, aswell as being less luck dependent. There are many options to look at the top cards etc. but that doesn't help that much, as others can/will change evertyhing with their actions.

Still a good game, but nothing I would ask for.

After 10 games already I can say : "This is a very good Workerplacement game with a big TAKE THAT level" I love it.
Too all the people complaiing about this game : if it is to long, play the geisha version & play 8 turns, remove the black mission kill the Shogun (= For the Designer); if the game is to harsh for you don't play it ot swallow your pride & hit the enemy back.

In short, Yedo is a mission-based worker placement game with a bit or 'trash aesthetics thrown in for good measure. If this game had been built from the ground up (e.g., like a Knizia, Kramer, or Splotter classic) and came out in a period in which the market weren't over-saturated with games which are similar in scope, length, and weight, I would rank the game more highly (and would also enjoy it more). I don't think this game brings anything new to the table, but what's worse is that the way in which old elements are blended together doesn't necessarily work for me as a gamer: 1) the worker placement in conjunction with the shear amount of hidden information means that my options to get creative with putting sticks in the wheels of another player (who might be making a points-based getaway) feel limited (or worse, haphazard); 2) the ways in which interaction is included is, first, through a one-and-a-half times around auction, but nothing on the chopping block feels *needed* in a bidding war sense (i.e., all options are generally good), and second, through "take that" type cards which feel too 'easy' (i.e., considering how complicated it is to otherwise hamper opponents, to rely on randomly drawn but extremely effective cards seems contradictory). It's not a bad game per say, but the complexity level for the different interacting parts feels off. Not too mention the time-to-weight ratio. If I play a game of that length, I really want it to feel much more involving (e.g., non-stop negotation such as with Traders of Genoa, brain-burning and rewarding depth and complexity such as with Neuland).

The upside of knowing that this is often called the "gamer's Lords of Waterdeep" means that I won't have to play LoW to see what the fuss is all about!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
More complex than Lords of Waterdeep, however NOT deeper. I would actually argue that there is more randomness in this game than LoWD. And to seal the deal, with 5 players it took exactly 4 hours to play, excluding rules explanation. Oh, and I forgot too mention the take that moments, they really suck!

This game has a cool theme, artwork is above par, but ultimately it's a way too long luckfest!!! This game hits all the wrong buttons for me!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Yedo is a auction/worker placement game, using some of the strengths of both to limit and to empower the players' clans in a feudal Japan.

The artwork is pretty stunning; cards could be better quality but seem serviceable (if damageable).  The Cardboard punchouts are also of a lighter grade- but really it's fine, if players are careful.

The play... I think it would be useful to have a Turn Flow diagram readily accessible, but it all works, and works well together.

Players bid in an auction at start of turn for the best prices on valuable resources.  After this the market is reset and players see the Event card for the round.  Workers are then placed in various locations- and it is very possible to get shut out of something you needed, for those who love Agricola. After this the Provost- oops wrong game- the Watch move, and round up any Workers in the section of town where they stop (unless they are distrcated, or bribed, or...). And this can mean losing extra workers at a very critical moment. (definite screwage possibilities in this game)

THEN players get to use any workers left on the board in turn order to take actions, either selling/buying, collecting resources, or actually fulfilling missions (the biggest source of VP).

This game blends ideas from PoF, Agricola, Caylus, and other time-tested games in a thematic and interactive Japanese setting- there's a lot to love here!

So after a 1st solo game, this is starting at a conservative 7.25- but I don't think it will stop there.

This already seems like a good buy- bet it gets played again soon!

RATING: 3
Rating is provisional, based on one play with 4 players.

It has an interesting theme and very nice artwork, but it's a very long game (it took us at least 3.5 hours) with a huge amount of chaos. Blind draws, reliance on inter-player trading, take that cards, random events. Entering a round with little money is a death sentence which can eliminate you from the bidding phase and leave you with no good placement options, which pretty much makes an entire (excruciatingly long) round about as thrilling as watching paint dry. (Granted, entering a round with no money is a bad play, but you're punished pretty harshly for it in this game.) Seems to straddle the line between Euro and Ameritrash and at least initially feels like the worst of both worlds.

I'm totally open that this was just a poor first impression for me, so I will play it again and revise accordingly.

Update 7/3/2014:
A second play cemented my opinion. This game has a completely irritating amount of chaos given its length. A single card can undo 15 minutes of real time, and despite your best efforts you may not be able to mitigate against this sort of thing. That's fine in an Ameritrash but IMHO has no place in a Euro.

RATING: 6.5
All of the comments and reviews were right: Like Lords of Waterdeep, but this has more going on and more choices. There is more going on, and while it's definitely deeper than LoW, it doesn't seem to add enough depth to make the extra stuff seem worth it...if that makes any sense. This game is very thematic, so definitely scores points with me there. It plays a little too long for what it is, but it's easy enough to just play to 8 or 9 rounds instead of the full 11. It's a very cutthroat game...i.e. one move from an opponent or a bad event card can set you back big time. I usually like "take that", but yikes, this game can be mean lol. I enjoy it, but not something I'm likely going to play often.

A great worker placement game in every regard. Why the low score? It's just too long and tight(and quite punishing) for my tastes. Yedo is fantastic. I love the design and mechanics. But... the event deck and the guard mechanism can leave you in a world of hurt at many times causing the loss of a worker, which will need to be paid for again, money and precious resources. Also, worker allocation, resource, and money is extremely tight in this game, which leaves a very small window for error, which will turn off many.

Even with these beat down moments, I enjoy the game immensely...problem is, it's hard to get it to the table because of the length and steep learning curve of game play. Especially to those who have played Lord of Waterdeep, which is still my go to worker placement game in most scenarios. 

I would love for a second edition of this game, which shortens the play time and unwinds the tightness of the design.

There's a lot of Princes of Florence/Colosseum in this game; you're auctioning from certain sets of items and trying to make a set that fulfills certain requirements. Unlike those games, however, there's a take-that element and a lot more chaos. It's also more complex in ways that I enjoy, but the chaos gets a little frustrating. (1 play)

Once you've explored all the avenues of Lords of Waterdeep, move on to Yedo. This has a lot of the same feel as LoW, but with more decisions to be made and timing your actions so you can get the most bang for your buck. Because you're putting a lot of effort into getting one or two points, this can give you a bit of brain burn. But, it is also very rewarding to plan your moves just right to get a whopping five points!

The board for this game is beautiful. A little overwhelming at fist because of all the bright colors you see, and the different sections of the board have a lot going on. Nothing to complain about the components either. It is a fairly lengthy game so don't plan on unpacking and getting this played in less than two hours.

I have been eager to play Yedo for quite a while. What a disappointing game! Not fun. Too long. The action cards do uninteresting things and many unpleasant "take that" effects. There are insane crushing event cards--I was like: did that really just happen, really?!?!?!, am I playing In the Year of the Dragon?! Then many events block an area of the board for an entire game round, yet all the big points black missions require being at three different game areas. The action spaces are annoying and not that good. All the actions are expensive and its not easy to collect lots of cash. Hmmm Complete a bunch of easy missions so I can start rolling cash in to buy actions to build my engine so then a devastating fire and an infernal earthquake come to destroy the hard work of my past two rounds? Then the areas I need to go to to finally collect the jumbo points mission cards will be blocked the final three rounds? No thank you. The game board is beautiful. The action and purple cards are drab and boring and ugly. This game is a resounding DODGE! I would play it again, reluctantly.

RATING: 7.5
Heavier version of Lords of Waterdeep where you place workers, gain resources and complete missions.  Where LoW is fast, Yedo is not.  It has the common problem of making you grind to accomplish simple tasks but throws in random events that can close down vital game areas preventing anyone from being able to do anything on that round.  My initial excitement has faded, although this is still a very sound and involved game.  It needs to allow for players to gain additional money and weapons.  The interactive parts can be a little too interactive and may need to be removed from the game.  Likely trade soon.

Ok, this game is awesome but SO frustrating!! I worked hard to complete a black mission and was so close to victory and it got swept from under me. there went my 10 points and a bonus card that would have also given me 7 additional points. I felt pissed off and enjoyed the game at the same time. It was a weird combination but am looking forward to playing again.

This was described to me as a more complex Lords of Waterdeep, and that description is spot-on. I liked it more than LoW, and I'm not really sure why -- a cooler theme, a little less dry,  or maybe it's just because I won my first game :) Still, this is a game of collecting items to fulfill "tasks" on cards, and that's just never going to excite me much, no matter how well-executed.

This is a great worker placement game. Superficially, I can understand the comparisons to Lords of Waterdeep; it has analogs of quests, buildings, and Intrigue cards, but they're all implemented a little differently. Also, the worker placement mechanic is quite different, as is the resource management. The theme is fantastic, the art is beautiful. Out of the box, it is a better game than LoW. Scoundrels of Skullport might push LoW a little bit higher. Still very different, though.

Yedo provides the ultimate worker placement experience. The mix of auctions, missions, and event/action/bonus cards is very fluid. The missions are very thematic and really add to the feel of the game. Great synergy, a multitude of options each turn, and every decision matters. Design and attention to detail are extremely impressive--the flavor text on mission cards is indicative of dedicated, thorough designers. An extremely deep and well-executed game.

Engaging little worker placement game.
Multiple actions per turn, means you can really get some combinations of actions going. 
The theme is great too it fits very well.

I really liked the moving guard mechanism which made some of the actions un-takable on certain turns without playing a card to stop it, also you could play cards to influence the guards to move differently to usual which meant you could sometimes hinder your opponents.

Replaced by Champions of Midgard, given the choice between the two it would always be that game.

Got a nice offer, so sold it off. I am going to buy the 2nd printing with the corrected cards at Essen 13.

Great mix of auction, worker placement and hand management. Does not feel like Lords of Waterdeep at all (since you don't really use other peoples buildings in this one), but that is a positive in my book. This game is very much it's own thing. Played a couple of rules wrong in my first play through (3p), but it was still very enjoyable (nothing game-breaking). Good narrative too. UPDATE: More games played, more fun had, upped rating to 9

Way too many layers of randomness and chaos for such a long game: between the events, the missions, the available weapons, the action and bonus cards, and unpredictable, major Take that from other players' actions, the winner is seldom the one who played best. Also has infuriating moment arising from those Take that effects.

In short: fun game, great art and lots of possible strategies. 
A bit longer: The objective is to have the most points by the end of turn 11. You can try to sneak away with a few points at each round or you can work your way to a few big missions which give you lots of points at once. (or a combination of both strategies) The same applies to the interaction between players: do you go solo and try to achieve everything on your own or are you an active trader who prefers to obtain what you need from other players which doesn't cost action points (but helps them as well). Do you use your action cards to protect yourself from other players & world events, to obtain an advantage or to sabotage others?
The game offers a variety of strategies, a very nice setting with plenty of flavouring (such as the texts on the mission cards). It uses some elements and game mechanics that have been seen before but combines them in a very attractive and highly enjoyable game.

Since I'm married to one of the designers, I had to make an account to back their superb game!  I'm not a gamer at all, but I saw all the hours they put into it.  I also experienced the numerous testplayng sessions,...and everyone went home happy. 

So no, finally, way too late, i want to do a little effort .  Only because of the troubles to get it into the shops, all the work, love ,... this game deserves a 10 ;)
( I know, I'm biased :p)

And don't forget that this is their first game.  Not only first published, but also first ever homemade game.

 A shame that I can' t give more than a 10 ;).

Played the prototype several times.  Since I'm not a hardcore gamer, I was scared to play the game the first time.  But the designers promised me that I would be able to play the game alone after turn 4 at last.  And surprisingly I could.
Even my 11 year old son could play the game ( even better than me :p, don't tell him please ;).  
Every time we played the game, we found new ways to try to win.  So no chance of getting bored.
First I doubted to post my comment and ratings, cause I'm not that familiar with such games... but than I thought that all opinions matter, even the ones of people who don't play so much games ;).
I hope to have a real gamebox in my posession soon, becaus  my son loves it too, and than we don't have to ask the designer over and over again if they have time to play the prototype with us ;).
And I heard the graphics are really supurb. 

Changed rating from 8.5 to 10 because i got the box with the real deal. Prototype was great but final games graphics are really unbelievable beutifull!

Very fun mission based worker placement.  Definitely have to play more.

Update: Brought it to game night and played the designer recommended "short game."  It was...pretty good.  Not great.  I feel like the randomness of weapons in the shop and the general flukiness of mission requirements which could be easy or impossible with your current resources requiring a lot of extra actions or none is a missed opportunity.  

If you actually did some engine building instead of this rich get richer VP/money/stuff accumulation the the endgame would be more satisfying.  The first WP game I am just not good at.

Ninja Waterdeep, along with trading and more difficult to complete quests.

There are just so many better 2+ hr games that deserve my time.

RATING: 4.5
Downtime is pretty brutal, so game has to be played with people who make rapid decisions.

Getting the guard moved onto you is a disaster, and relatively difficult to control if he moves unexpectedly.    Shutting down the sector is a sufficient penalty methinks.  Too often I would make elaborate plans (and this game definitely requires elaborate plans, which is a good thing) only to see my good work unravel due to an unexpected move from the guard.

Feels good when you complete a card fully and get the bonus.

Again though, watching other people play is a bit boring, so make sure you play with fast people.

03-14-2014 - Eh, I'm not a crazy fan.  I think the game is actually pretty easy.  Last time I played I didn't fare so well, but it was mostly due to card draws (though there were some things I could have done differently for sure).  I doubt I'd request a play but I'd agree if it came out.  7.

Alright, finally got a chance to play this properly, with three players. Game ended on turn 6 because of one of those black missions. It's not too complicated and a decent amount of depth. Still, it is not a real hit: with three players, the bidding mechanic wasn't terribly interesting: every turn, each player could use at least one action in each group, so it was really lacking tension or meaningful dilemmas. 
Sold, because we rarely play these kind of worker-placement games, and I've got one in my collection which actually does it better: Lords of Waterdeep.

Very nice game that mixes several known mechanisms to a nice working result.
Played it just in a two player game but already could see that there is more strategic depth if playing with more.
A very big plus are of course the game rules which are in my opinion the most clearly written and created i ever have seen.
Every functionality is clearly shown and in doubt everything can be found easily.
The game board of course makes also most things self explaining.

In the strategy game Yedo, players assume the roles of Clan Elders in the city of Edo during the early years of the Tokugawa Shogunate. The object of the game is to amass Prestige Points, mainly by completing missions. To do so, players must gather the necessary assets and – most importantly – outfox their opponents and prevent them from completing their missions.

There are several ways to reach your goal. Will you try to complete as many missions as possible and hope that your efforts catch the Shogun's eye? Or will you choose a more subtle way of gaining power by trying to influence the Shogun during a private audience? You can also put your rivals to shame by buying lots of luxury goods from the European merchants. It's all up to you – but be careful to make the right choices, for in Yedo, eternal glory and painful disgrace are two sides of the same coin...

Only made a trial run so far. I enjoyed how what you wanted to achieve also was what scored you points, which is not always the case. So while I have hopes, I’ve found myself less attracted to games with more straightup worker placement…

I find several mechanisms that is similar with Princes of Florence and with Lords of Waterdeep (both games I really enjoy - especially PoF).  

The main issue I have with Yedo is the negative effects from the events deck along with their random timing.  It doesn't seem to fit into the balance of the rest of the mechanisms, which are hard enough to skillfully navigate.  The randomness of the events throws off the auctions and vice-versa, in my opinion.  Auctions are used to balance the price/cost of various choices or items.  The events deck just randomly disrupts this (and the rest of an already challenging game).  I personally found that events, through no cause of my own planning or choices or plays, disrupted many of my options through no fault of my own gameplay.  It was frustrating for several players to just sit out of at least 3 consecutive rounds in the middle of the game, accomplishing relatively nothing just because very bad event cards.  The events deck is large enough that one cannot really plan of the possible calamities.  You can play very well and skillfully but the events can knock you completely out of the game.  I think either (1.) the events deck contains too many cards that adversely effect players, or (2.) it's a totally unnecessary aspect of the game and should be ignored.

I'd rather play Lords of Waterdeep or even better, Prince of Florence. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Ultimately, while I enjoy this one, I've found this game tends to drag a bit over the middle rounds as the transition from easy missions to more difficult ones does not usually go very smoothly.  My opponents often do not appreciate the potential chaos of the event deck and the action cards in many situations as they are difficult to prevent/plan.  I sold my copy as a result.  

===============================================

Yedo is an interesting worker placement game that will bring about quite a bit of angst whether it be caused from nasty event cards, nasty action cards, opponents blocking you from placement in a necessary district, the city guard kicking you out of a district (whether it be because you weren't paying attention or someone plays an action card moving the guard farther than expected), or just blaming the card draw when you can't draw mission cards that work well together!  This game is all about working through the all the pain the game throws at you and making good decisions on whether to hedge your bet or go all out and take a lot of risks.  Some of the pain and agony of the game can be reduced or mitigated by having a blessing on hand.  Be aware that there are some mission cards in the black (hardest) deck that can grant a large number of points (8+ points) which can be a bit of a shock otherwise!  Turn order can be important and money can be tight if one doesn't complete a number of green missions early and continue to complete missions throughout the game.

Your first play will take some time so be prepared to hanker down and learn the cards and what they do.  I'd recommend when you introduce new players to the game that they be shown some of the particularly nasty event and action cards so they have an idea of what could occur.

So far, the five player teaching game took us 3 hours.  A three player game with one new to the game took around 90 minutes.  From my limited experience, this game appears to handle 3-5 players very well.

Well implemented Euro in which you gather resources to complete missions.  There is never enough time to gather everything you would like so it becomes a matter of seeking the most efficient means to your ends. Random events and other players "take that" action cards can play a large role.

Lords of Waterdeep killer.  Same basic idea, but with more player interaction, better theme (and art), more variability, and more depth overall, without overly increasing the play time.  It is longer to play/teach, but is sooo worth it.  Game play almost feels too fast because there is a lot to think about when it's not your turn.  It's not often my partner and I play a 1.5-2hr game back to back, but we've done it many times with this one.  Super good 2 player, super good 4 player as well (haven't played with 3 players).

It feels like Princes of Florence, but with an unappealing theme (to me), and lots of other mechanics thrown in around the auction. It was pretty much broken with 2 players, and was overly long for what it was. We also didn't like the events or the screw-you cards.

Maybe it would work for a group of 5 people who love the setting commited to playing it many times. It just wasn't the right game for us, and we'd rather play Princes of Florence any day.

It is indeed a very nice eurogame with a great story and theme.
After studying the rules I had some doubts about a couple of points (like trading phase between players and foresight action) but dissipated when playing looking how everything work smoothly.
Only complain is the length of the game but that's my fault, with young kids you don't have so much time as you wish to spend it on (great) games.
Vote could easily increase after more games.

I am very conflicted on this one.  This game with he Samurai cards can be very frustrating.  There are whole turns where you cannot do anything.  And I hated that aspect to the point where it is angering.  

Even without this, there are still elements that you can get messed up with the watchmen or whatever he is called.  The artwork is excellent.  The worker placement mechanic is strong.  

It has aspects that are fun.  But there are these frustrating aspects as well.

[b][thing=117915][/thing][/b] works well as a two-player and I enjoy playing it quite a bit.  But am not completely enamoured by it.  Playing two-player, it becomes pretty apparent by the mid-game who is probably going to win.  Although it is possible to have large VP swings by completing the more difficult missions, I do feel a sense of momentum in the game.  And if you start to fall behind, it's difficult to catch up; there are no real catch up mechanics besides a few random event cards which give money based on reverse VP position.  The game rewards long term planning (in the accumulation of Annexes and weapons) as it's virtually impossible to complete the difficult missions in a single turn.  Though it is a worker placement game, it isn't like [thing=31260][/thing] where you take the action immediately.  The order you place the workers isn't necessarily the order you'll activate them - rewarding players with flexible/multiple plans.  As for the theme, it annoys me.  It's supposed to take place during the reign of Hidetada Tokugawa, the "golden age" of the Tokugawa Shogunate.  The lords that the players represent would not dare be doing half the missions that they're presented with in this game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Mixed feelings after 1 play. On one hand, I like what this game is trying to do. Worker placement with a lot going on (there are often difficult decisions to be made), the ability to hit other players with various nasty cards, secret goals and missions with widely varying prerequisites, and looks very nice too with great production values. With a game this complex, you don't really expect things to go smoothly on your first play, and I certainly made a number of big mistakes. I definitely hope to play again soon, and expect my rating to go up if anything, but there are 2 critical things here.

First, time - it took almost 4 hrs for our 5 player game (though 4 of us were new to the game) and we were trying quite hard to keep it moving. Assume maybe 3hrs for 4 players, where it apparently shines best. Second, in principle the longer the game, the less of a role I want luck to play in the outcome, and anything hitting the 3 hr mark needs to persuade me that I have an appropriate degree of control over how I fare in the game to reward the time and effort I'm putting in.

Even having removed the 4 worst disaster events as we did, at times luck played a significant role. The remaining event cards still produced some very damaging effects (some of which you cannot defend against - i.e. a location being rendered unusable for a whole round), players block each other accidentally quite often, the nasty action cards can do you/other players serious damage (I call this 'luck' since it depends on who draws a given card and how whimsically they use it), the extent to which your mission cards overlap will vary quite a bit, I could go on.

I suspect the balance leans slightly too far towards luck than I'd like in the long run, but deeper knowledge of the game may reveal ways to mitigate some risks (a couple of ideas on this have already occurred to me, which shows I am still thinking about the game). Finally, the latter rounds did feel like something of a marathon, even though I generally enjoy getting stuck into long/tough games, so I would not recommend playing with 5 players unless perhaps all 5 already know the game well. I wouldn't be surprised if I liked it most with just 2 players, but can see 3 or 4 working too.

Edit: 2nd game with 4 players (all of whom had played before) was much smoother, finishing in 2.5 hrs. There is still plenty of luck involved, and as in the 1st game players were hurling cards at the table in frustration as events beyond their control turned against them, but the level of luck seemed less of a problem at this reduced game length... having said that, the word "unbelievable" was used I'd say over 20 times, often combined with an unprintable adverb. To some extent the twists and turns of chance added quite a bit of excitement, and this time I did a better job of mitigating against the risks, made wiser choices, screwed my enemies over at every opportunity, and enjoyed the victory quite a lot. Those who lost bemoaned their ill luck, were very frustrated at times, and enjoyed it less. I guess that may be the way it goes with Yedo, but fun was just about had by all, even those who lost most badly. For now, I would not turn down a game with up to 4 players.

Finally, the loudest complaints over luck always stem from the event deck, but remember you *can* mitigate against this - perhaps the most overlooked action in the game is to look at the top 3 cards of this deck to check what is coming.

I like this as a 2-player game, and as of today (2014-10-23) I've only played it that way.  It may be more interesting with 3 or more, but the fact that it plays much more quickly with 2 is a big plus.

RATING: 4.9
with each play, my rating drops.  Too much work for (what feels like) very little reward.  You can spend 3-4 turns preparing for a mission, then 1 event/action card can set you back another turn or two.  Also, get behind in the money game early, you're done...and the rich get richer (via cheap auctions).  No significant catch up mechanism available.  I feel as though the good decisions made to progress toward goals are thwarted by uncontrollable outside elements.  Knowing that disaster management is the key factor is fine in a 60 min game, not one that takes 120+ mins...unless you're playing Adv Civ, of course.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Plain worker placement game that just lasts too long (with 4 players). Who wants to invest brain time when the results can easily be undone by a randomly drawn card or an event that happens out of the blue.

This game feels very much like [thing=555][/thing] but with a lot more randomness, less depth and much longer playtime.

I can understand that action cards can be interesting for family games, but this is a dead serious game of 3+ hours playtime (with 4 players). These action cards can have serious effects. And we already have the "event card" mechanism that can hustle things around.

Game material is beautiful and appealing, although the board contains so many drawings and icons, that it's sometimes hard to find the information you need (especially during a first play). Rulebook is clear.

Minus: 2 - 3 (playtime!) - 5 - 6 - 8 (too much luck based on cards)

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Big and bold, and this goes for both the colourful game board and the brave idea of coupling a 2+ hour eurogame with a good dash of luck and take that. This flies in the face of conventional wisdom about what players want, but rather than uncomfortably sitting on the fence between euros and adventure games, I feel that Yedo manages to land in the happy space also inhabited by Dominant Species. It’s worthwhile to have a plan, but those plans can be horribly busted, and being the best player does not guarantee a win.

Although it is often described as a more involved Lords of Waterdeep, I see a far stronger bond to Princes of Florence, especially visible in the initial auction round and the bonus cards. It is, however, no more than a clear inspiration, and nowhere near to the blatant idea theft of, for example, Trains. Yedo certainly stands on its own, and I’d be happy to try this again, and might even buy it at some point.

I don't know... I guess I enjoyed it ok.  I think that sometimes people take a popular trending mechanic (like worker placement) and a popular trending game (like Lords or Waterdeep) and throw a new theme on it (like Japanese Shogun stuff), and then convolute it unnecessarily to make a new game.  I just don't know that this really needed to be made, and to me personally it feels like some elegance was sacrificed for some additional thematic elements that really don't add to the experience much.  It's just a bit more to think about than I think was needed (thinking specifically of the events - especially on hard mode.)

Also, I get that people want some "take that" stuff added, but I just don't think I like putting plan in place that's going to take 3 or 4 rounds, and having someone just "break" it by throwing a card down.  Some of the actions can get kind of nasty.  Just a bit too nasty for me for the type of game this is.

But like I said, I enjoyed it ok.  Neat theme, neat art, and I can appreciate the work that went into it.  I just don't know that I personally care to play Shoguns of Waterdeep version 1.5

ADDENDUM: Wow, guess the designers are responding to people rating their game less than positive.  Ok, so I guess if I read through the diaries and history of the game I wouldn't be so ignorant as to not know that this game was well into development before Waterdeep was published.  Sorry for the suggestion that this game was derivative of another, when that could not have been chronologically possible.  At any rate, my rating remains the same for now.  Maybe I'll play again and change it.  I hope my positive thoughts were noted though.  I do appreciate all that went into this game.  And it is the perfect game for someone that likes Lords of Waterdeep, but wants some more things to think about - and that enjoys Feudal Japan more than D&D Mages and such.

I love the questing in this one. It makes so much sense that you don't lose your buildings or weapons when you use them in a quest. I also really like the watchman and events. It adds an extra level of strategy, while still requiring you to stay adaptable.

... mmmh, generally this is 'my kind of game', but especially the absolutely unbalanced action cards pretty much ruin it IMHO. I can live with different 'grades of usefulness', but there shouldn't be cards that can ruin the whole game for another player (which aren't even part of the Samurai cards). E.g. last game I had a card to 'trade' a mission with a player who only had one black and one yellow mission left and was trying to get the 'components' for the black one. I could trade him another black mission which I wasn't able to complete and which the other player would never be able to fulfil since he was missing a necessary building. Since it was two rounds to the end the other player would never be able to recover...This would be OK for a 30 min 'Take That'-game, but not in a two hour and up 'heavy' game.

In the lapse of 2 or 3 years I have been part of the playtesting crews. I enjoyed every play, but noticed that fierce event cards can cast you back for a few turns in fulfilling some of your missions. This has been polished with the Geisha variant. Playing time 2.5 hours (with 4) never get boring. Short downtime. Brilliant game.

Nice thematic euro. I like the Japan theme a lot so it gets extra point for that. Especially the first 2-3 games are SO cool when you don't know the cards yet. It's good after that too though. There are bunch of decks and piles that are randomized for each game to make it replayable. It could be bit shorter, but other than that it's very fun (yes, fun!) interactive (auctions,blocking,occasional attacks) euro without endless resource conversions. Now that I think about it, another bonus point for that.

Oh Yedo, how we love thee. We tried this game on a whim off the library shelf at FallCon and were immediately impressed with the beauty and detail of the game. It's a gorgeous game. I love the challenges and the planning required.. A little strategy and a little luck come together to really keep you on your toes. Love this game!

Awesome worker placement game.

I like the aspect of "managing the random" in this game.
The game definitely has interaction, but it does not steal the show. 
You do not get hosed every time you plan on something, but you definitely have to observe where and when you make your move or else your meeple/rewards are gone.

There were no progress in the game. Nothing became more difficult. All rounds were the same.

We skipped the trading phase since we don't like those things in a boardgame.

The actions on the board was too bad. Sometimes it felt you had no use for your guys.

A great and extremely thematic worker placement game.

Great mechanism that sets it aside from other mission-based worker-placemen games is that you get to keep the items you need and use for the missions (most of the time), so you can make an engine out of them to complete many mission cards.

A nice combination of worker placement and a clever auctioning system with a one-round system where the starting bidder gets one final bid after the round.

So many clever systems working great together including trading that actually works and isn't available all the time and crazy challenging missions that you need to spend many turns preparing for.

This game drips with theme and flavor. I hesitate to state flatly that it fires Lords of Waterdeep, but that is certainly the thought on my mind. They could share the shallow description of "place workers to gather resources used to complete missions" but Yedo is so much more intricate, more interesting, more engaging, more strategic. Trading, auctions, and card play offer far more player interaction than simply blocking. Location requirements on missions is much more involved than simple cube counts. The game is just fun and sucks in everyone who plays it.

Just boring. Much too long. We wanted to love it but we gave up after 3rd try. In comparison to other Worker-Placement Games (E.g. Rokoko, Lords of Waterdeep, Caylus, Bruxelles 1893) the development takes too long and there are too less interesting decisions to make.

Lords of Waterdeep with more complexity.  

I am fine with this game.  People that cannot handle random events in a game will hate that part of it.  Doing take that parts between players some people may not like.  Finally, if you do not get good quests at the beginning that work for you, you will not do great (similar to Lords of Waterdeep and Ticket to Ride).  

It was a nice hybrid of Euro worker placement and Amerithrash random events and take that mechanics.  I'd play it again after I get through the other 10,000 games that I still haven't played.

Good game, which is on par with Lords of Waterdeep. It's possibly a little heavier, because there's a bit more going on, since you have auctions on top of your regular worker placement mechanics. 

My group was a little hot and cold with the event deck. It seems to have the potential to be a little swingy.

Dropped rating from 8 to 6. My first play was a little rough, but the game intrigued me and I put it down to me just being new and not knowing what I was doing yet.

My second play dragged on for an eternity, and I was pretty much ready to be done with it around the halfway point. The number of useful things to do on your turn just feels a little too constrained, especially when you just need a couple more items to complete a mission, and you get blocked out of the place you needed to go. I realize being blocked is just par for the course in worker placement games, and I suppose that just means you should always have a backup plan, but the game just wasn't interesting enough for me to want to put that much thought into it.

The base of this is a standard worker placement / mission completion game, in the area of 'Lords of Waterdeep'.  Put a dude down, acquire some good that is either temporary or semi-permanent (see below) and then when you have gathered enough junk that matches the symbols on one of your mission cards, you complete the mission.  One interesting element to the game is that you must have a worker in a specific region or regions of the board to complete a mission - the mission card indicates where you must be.

Interesting, but when paired with several other elements of the game, highly annoying.  As with most satisfying worker placement games, much of the challenge and tension with this game comes with the fact that there isn't enough spots for all workers, so blocking is an element of the game as is preparing out multiple contingencies so that you are never locked out of a meaningful action.  But, running against this are two things 1) there are highly random cards that can throw off most contingency plannings by shutting down whole regions of the board or destroying materials that you had acquired to that point - even those that are otherwise permanent; and 2) there are plenty of non-meaningful actions that you can take as part of an worker action.  In fact, looking across the board, many of the actions available involve scanning the top several cards of the many available decks.  Yes, one can acquire enough workers in a way that then uses them to scan the decks and then know what randomness could be coming up, but compared towards the reward of completing missions, this approach is low reward and extremely boring.  

In the two games I played an event occurred in the last round that destroyed the ability for me and other players to complete a black mission card.  The black mission cards are the hardest to complete and require a lot of materials and planning to complete them.  One may expect to complete 1, maybe 2, during the course of the game, and these would come late in the game.  Given the amount of preparation involved to complete these, one stupid random event that shuts down a region or removes an annex makes for a unsavory experience.  Taken with my final issue with the game - the sheer length of it, I can easily say that this is one game I have played 2 times too many.

First of all, my English isn't that good. :-) I played this game (prototype) with the 2 "inventors" Wolf & Thomas. 
The Theme is really well picked, the graphics are very Epic (with Franz Vohwinkel), the mechanics are good, there is a lot and something for every player ! except dice rolling :-)  Bidding, interaction, worker placement, little bit of bluff. A very good mix, a great euro game. 
I find that is has elements of many other games, but it has something that combines all these things in one.
You have to complete missions (The Black ones are very hard) and the fluff on the mission, little texts are quite amusing. To complete missions You have to send out your disciples into the town Yedo (old Tokyio) but be aware of the Watch patrol. You aquire weapons, building, ... the goal is to earn prestige points. 
I realy like this game & looking forward to purchase it at Essen 2012.

This game holds a special place for me, since it was the first proper Euro game I ever played following its Essen release in 2012. The game is a lot of fun. It's a worker placement game with a vibrant board and tons of theme injected into the actions you take. Doing quests here is a very satisfying mechanism, and while the game can be brutal and force you to change strategies on the fly, it usually doesn't feel like you're being singled out in that respect. Lords of Waterdeep with its expansion is probably the better-designed game, but Yedo has a certain charm about it that makes it a good alternative option.

UPDATE: Almost 5 years later, and this game is holding strong. Yedo has a tenseness to it that I rarely see in worker placement games, and that is why it has remained in my collection despite not caring about WP as much these days.

It's Prince of Florences with more chrome. 

The game takes a pretty long time, but it's filled with decisions. Managing cards and meeples may seem easy, but you need to keep your mind open and change plan all the time to be competitive.

The events are a bit random to me though. Given that there are other random factors in the game, I find it ok, players just have to play the game with backup plan in mind and managing risk.

Objectively speaking, this strikes me as a "better" version of Lords of Waterdeep with more strategic planning possible. The Samurai cards, which increase the level of random bad events and take-that effects, are something that I'd probably never want to play with. The big question hanging over the game is whether or not the game justifies its substantially longer playtime over Waterdeep (it could take up to twice as long) with strategic decision making. I want to say yes (indeed, the length of the game helps mitigate bad luck and allows time to recover from unexpected losses) but a run time that pushes near the three hour mark puts it in competition with a lot of heavier games that I'd probably prefer to play.

Never really played it because there was not enough reasons in its design as a 2-player game to take the worker placement spot of favorite Lords of Waterdeep + expansion.  

Not a fan of auction mechanisms anymore or the look-at-the-top-3-cards to plan ahead.

Also, it is mean-spirited, as most missions are about doing something "evil" such as kidnapping or killing rival family members.

RATING: 9
Until there's a fix to the game arc/game length problem, I won't be playing this again. The first 5-7 rounds I'd rate an 8 or 9, and then rounds 7-11 drag and deflate the momentum -- at that point, everyone already has all their people, their annexes, their bonus cards, and it becomes a slog to the end, eradicating all the built-up goodwill of this clever Princes of Florence-Lords of Waterdeep hybrid.
----
Two years later, I was persuaded to give Yedo another go. This time, all 11 rounds went by with a high level of momentum and fun factor. The first time was a 5er, and by round 8, I had felt stymied and genuinely surprised that the game hadn't ended yet. With 4, the game is still tight but not constrictively so. There is space to mitigate some of the bad luck (or maybe luck was not as against me this time -- there is quite a bit of luck in this game, from the events that hit every round coupled with luck of the draw in any of 7 decks of things). So this is a 6 for the 5 player game, and a 9 for the 4. Upping overall rating from 6
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Wayyyyy longer than it needs to be, with goals that can be too-often tampered with by others. I suspect the missions and/or bonus cards may not be particularly well-balanced. I further suspect that the whole thing is borrowed wholesale from Goa and/or Princes Of Florence. I have great respect for those two classics and laying a cool theme on those games isn't enough reason for me to want to play it consistently.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
There are actually a couple of reasons why I should (and probably do in these aspects) like this even better than Lords of Waterdeep. It has a little more depth, there is more planing involved, I love the added timing aspect of it and I really like the theme integration and it has some interesting twists to it like the guard and the events that are changing the game a little bit from round to round. 

In the end Lords of Waterdeep however still has the edge for me a little, mainly because of the amount players and the game itself can mess up your plans in Yedo a little too much sometimes which is why it can also feel a little too random sometimes. It can also be a little too long with more players. 

Still I do enjoy this game a lot and while mechanically similar and apparently a game mechanic that I enjoy a lot overall, it does feel different enough from LoW to definetley stay in the collection and see the table from time to time, when I'm up for something a little more "brutal".

This is the quintessential "recipe" game with a ninja theme laid over worker placement, bidding and set collection mechanics; those are the phases of just one of eleven rounds! Bidding, drafting, placement, repeat, ad nauseum. I'm making this sound boring, yet Yedo is a very tense, exciting game to play. And it's the perfect length: only eleven rounds. No mysterious end game trigger that interrupts someone's turn or strategy. Eleven rounds to complete as many missions as you can. The art is wonderful and very thematic and the flow of the game is simple to learn but deep enough to continually engage me. I definitely got lucky with this game: everything made sense to me. Which it usually doesn't: Tichu confuses me, Terra Mystica overwhelms me, but Yedo was perfect. When someone asks me, "What do you want to play?" I forget that Yedo was fun and painless experience.

For a game beset by Euro mechanic borrowings, it's awfully long. It's a bit of this, a bit of that, and a bit of wash-rinse-repeat over 11 rounds. Like all auction games, it's not easy to play well from the beginning as the mastery of fluxing valuations requires experience. This gives it replay, and at least the borrowings are all from decent games, lending it further replay. The events and action cards seem to provide a fair whiff of accidental collateral damage and winner determination, which is at odds with the length of the game and its Euro roots - that kind of thing is more acceptable the further down the Ameritrash end of the spectrum it is. All of which means it doesn't nestle easily into a niche that most gaming groups will be able to rally the flag around. I'm ok with giving it some more table time to see if it can find a (quicker) home, but it's clearly not a game for everyone.

"Solid worker placement (action drafting) euro. Seems to be playable without major screwage. The full 11-round game runs a bit long for my tastes."

What I like:
- There seem to be a lot of sub-strategies to complete missions for VP
- The theme is (mostly) nice, and comes through in the missions
- The 2p action spaces seemed reasonably tight

What I don't like:
- 2.5 hrs for a 2p game was long--90 minutes would have been better
- Buying and using geishas is very unappealing
- The board is quite busy, and the game has a couple poor graphic design choices
- The watchtower can be used as a form of attack
- I wish there were an action to obtain a new bonus card
- I'm not a fan of trading in games; 
- The 2p auctions are quite loose (which I didn't mind that much, personally)

I can totally see the "Lords of Waterdeep on steroids" description, as you gather resources to fulfill missions for VP. There is more going on here, for sure, but I see the weight as closer to 3 than 3.5. There are subtleties around choosing the minor actions (e.g. peeking at decks). 

I would probably want to drop the trading rule. It is almost meaningless in 2p, and would just make 3+ player games run even longer, which they don't need.

Beautiful game design. Loved trying this out. Even as a 2-player game this is fantastic, can't wait to try as a 5-player game (if I ever get that pdf file Pandasaurus). Will give it a full rating once I have played a full game.

RATING: 8
We got this game because of our liking of Lords of Waterdeep.  Although they are both the same genre, they play as very different games.  Its a little daunting to look at, at first because the board is noisy and prefers Kanji to Western character sets and words but you figure it out quickly enough thanks to an abundance of icons and fluff you can actually read.

Need to play Yedo a few more times to cement the rating, but upon first blush, I'll call it a 7.

Long playtime killed this one.  I could never get it to the table, and the randomness of the weapons, etc. made it problematic to commit to.

Played Yedo for the first time a few weeks ago, and I rated it 9.
Yesterday I got two more plays in(with two different groups), and it was still a lot of fun.
In both games there were times where we had those ARRRRRGH-if-I-had-placed-a-dude-in-that-spot-I-could-have-finished-an-extra-black-mission.
And I think those moments show that it's a great game... (And, for now, we haven't even read the thematic filler-text on the mission cards)
 Once again, a great and fun game...

The basic premise of the game is that you're trying to complete various "mission" cards by accumulating the stuff that's pictured.  Getting the stuff works a little like Princes of Florence: first there was an auction for some of the stuff, and then you could buy the other stuff (using worker placement).  The worker placement spots don't always work because of the guard, but careful play can usually avoid that.  There is a TON of different stuff in the game, which makes trying to get precisely what you want a bit of a challenge.  Unfortunately, it often seems to come down to either drawing the right mission cards, or being in the right place at the right time.  It's an enjoyable game, but it seems like the variety comes more from the sheer number of different items you can collect rather than quality gameplay.

Comment: You're a samurai family off to cause a ruckus in town. Only problem is, you're not alone. This game feels like Lords of Waterdeep matured. The game is very much about following your mission cards. Maybe to a fault. I felt like the artwork was nice, albeit a bit too busy and the missions felt incredibly thematic. I just felt like there was much too much chaos for such a tight game. It would be akin to Agricola if it had random events that could hurt you. No thanks.

Also, the game just feels too long. By round 8 or 9 I feel like I'm basically done with what I wanted to do. I understand why they made it so long, but it just stops being interesting by round 8.

My last complaint is the components. They felt thin and ready to fall apart. In fact some of the coins that I had literally started to fall apart while we played.

Optimal Player Count: 5 > 4 > 3 > 2
I'll play it with 2, but it's far more optimal with 3+ players.

This is a step up from Lords of Waterdeep for sure! I've heard a lot of recommendations about this game and I've finally get to play it at a local board game meetup. Let's put it this way, you won't win unless you get some games under your belt. However, this is a more fun version compared to Lords of Waterdeep down the line when my gaming level raises up to medium weighted games. I am sure the rating will go up in the future, but for now, I will happily play a less weighted game than this one until I understand the nuances of the game in the future. It certainly has more theme and a theme that I like more than LoW.

Yedo is basically a good game - and a beautiful one too! The mechanisms work smooth and the production value is high. The thing that bothers me with this game - after only one playing I have to admit - is the fact that you play for three hours and the game is decided by a hefty dose of luck in the last rounds. Let me elaborate: You can easily fulfill the green and the yellow missions without any trouble if you plan and act accordingly. When it comes to red or black, you are in need of the right possessions, action cards [i]and[/i] luck; the player, who has a little more the latter, makes the race. Our game was decided when the winner fulfilled a 10 VP mission (I think it was 10) in a round where the event card said "double VP for missions this round". I had a good black mission for the last three rounds (and everything that was need for it), but there was always something that hindered me from fulfilling it - the guard or an event card. This was a little frustrating for a three hour worker placement game. From this genre, I prefer Pillars of the earth or Stone Age. 

ADDENDUM: I just received a GM from [username=The Wasp] stating that there are rulings to prevent the card [i]"double VP for the mission this round"[/i] from being too powerful. This would be a) discard the card after turn 5 and draw another one, or b) use the rules in this thread: http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/896019/event-the-honor-is-mine

The game round starts with an auction and then moves into a worker placement phase. In placement, nearly the same things from the auction are available, but of course before you could have gotten them for dollars, and now you have to spend workers AND dollars. Calculating the value of one vs the other is a really fun aspect of this game. The fact that major resources aren't spent and can be reused if you are clever/careful is fantastic. There's a ton of game here, and it's like nothing else.

The game's various card piles have uneven effects in terms of power, which goes beyond the situation where sometimes you might get a card you just can't use. One action card might give you 5 bucks, and another might MURDER your opponent's guy. Sheesh!

Components wise the board looks very busy almost to the point of being unclear, and some of the components such as the player boards don't have the thickness they deserve.

An enjoyable worker placement game. While a longer game, it keeps you involved. 
I Liked the combination of auction and placement to accomplish your goals. By watching the player order, you can pretty well know what you will be able to do. The locations on the board acquire permanent items, and are needed for the temporary locations required to accomplish missions. More workers and items can be acquired via action which may be the most cost effective way. We didn't trade much which is something we overlooked. 
The missions are in 4 categories for easiest to hardest. The easy missions generally reward you with improvements, the harder add victory points as well.

I have such a love/hate relationship with this game. I enjoy it a ton, but there are a few elements I strongly dislike about it. They mostly revolve around luck being a deciding factor: either not being able to get the weapons you need to finish a mission, or being randomly locked out of areas you need to place workers in by the event deck.

Otherwise, I definitely enjoy the mechanisms and gameplay for this game.

Common mechanics, place your token, take resources, fulfill cards, get victory points. Much tooooooo long for that kind of stuff.

Bad: lucky/unlucky bonus cards distributed by random.

At it's heart, Yedo is a fairly simple worker placement game (resembling Lords of Waterdeep in execution). Collecting the resources needed to finish a mission is easy, but knowing when to make a move to get ahead of the competition is a different story. Actions are very limited and sometimes it's required to get friendly with your competitors just to get things done. 

Even though I love the mechanics of Yedo, I think my favorite thing is just how beautiful it is. It really helps give it an edge over the competition. The only problem I have with the game is that it tends to go a little long the more players you include, and I prefer to game in large groups. Still, it proves itself worth the extra time.

A current favourite. Hugely thematic euro with elements of luck that can throw the best laid plans into turmoil. A unique combination of auction, set collection, job fulfilment, avoiding capture (chasing) and meaningful trading neatly woven into an overarching worker placement mechanic that nails the feudal Japanese theme.

I particularly like the way it flips resource management, making it a viable strategy to search the mission decks for the perfect fit for your clans current skills/weapons ... instead of working to collect the right resources for the missions you drew blindly. Can be prone to some eye-watering backstabbery from rival clans!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
The best thing I can say about this game is that it feels very much like Lords of Waterdeep but better. The board is tighter, making competition over good spaces more fierce, and each action is meaningful. The order in which you activate your placed workers can make or break your game as much as just placing them in the right spots.

Combined with the events, various mission types and levels, action cards, bonus cards, and other options, this game really feels like a refined and well executed game of intrigue and jockeying for position.

My only complaint about this game is that the board is almost too colorful. Sometimes it feels too busy and can be distracting, especially to new players trying to learn the game.

A solid game engine completely ruined by high variance in luck, take-that spite, and painfully imbalanced cards.  Also the theoretical ability to decide the difficulty of the missions your draw is only sort of there -- some easy missions are effectively harder than some medium missions, etc.

With more development, this game could have been solid.  As is, it just has too many rough edges.

A more intersting version of Lords of Waterdeep with more interactions. Points are hard to come by as most missions are only 2-3 points but it makes the game very close.

This is an incredibly thematic game using worker placement to tactfully complete missions while also executing actions on the board to prepare for your upcoming missions. This is one of those games where you're constantly preparing for the future. Specifically, how and when to transition from your current mission requirements to the next. After playing Yedo, I tend to be quite satified with a sense of accomplishment.

Fun japanese-themed worker placement game.  I think playing with 5 players makes the game too slow, but it was still enjoyable.  I was pretty sure I was going to come in second, but my self-induced lack of bonus cards meant that I did not get any end game points to boost my score.  I should probably do that next time.  Looked great and the auction round was a great addition.  Would play again with the gaming group!

Frequently called Princes of Florence on steroids. It's  true in that the main mechanic of acquiring creators (missions) and collecting resources needed to fulfill them is practically the same, as is the outline of the round sequence - first auctions for resources, then take actions.  Yedo adds however so much to this concept, that it doesn't resemble 'Princes' anymore. Firstly, there is the worker placement mechanic together with possibility of gaining new workers, which governs the action taking. Secondly, there's more randomness, as you draw more things blindly and pick from fewer options. Thirdly, there's negative interaction in the form of 'action' cards, which can as soon help you as hinder another. Together with the watch patrol which can arrest your workers, there's quite a lot of unpredictability to this game. Overall, there are many more options and things to do, and while action management is still at it's core, it's not the entire game as in 'Princes'. It takes two-three times as much time to play and has a lot of chrome where 'Princes' where elegant and streamlined. It is still undeniably a euro game, but one which tries to provide a lot of theme, even resorting to flavour texts.  It would be perhaps best compared to Colosseum - another take on Princes of Florence. Both have more theme and mechanics, and both feature trading, but Yedo is even longer and more complex. All three are great games wich despite similarities feel different niches, and I like them all for different reasons.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
At its best, playing Yedo is an intense experience, richly thematic as you struggle to bring your clan to ascendency through nefarious plots and double dealing. The game mechanisms that implement this are splendidly crafted - there's randomness through shuffled cards and events - but ways to counter that randomness and even to make it work for you (through 'foresight' actions). Spectacular gains and catch ups are possible - or you might get out front and stay out front, blocking your rivals at every step, consolidating your power base. Or, and this might be considered Yedo at its worst unless you have a particularly deep strain of masochism, the game can be a long sequence of frustrations at every turn, making little or no progress, every possible event that could screw things up just that little bit further getting drawn, every lucky break that could put your opponents ahead working out for them. I don't believe that this is a flaw in the game. When I've had a truly horrible game (which pretty much sums up 3 games out of 8 played so far) the down turn in my luck was mostly down to a crucial poor decision on my part - a great goal discarded, an impossible mission hung onto for too long, letting an opponent in two player get the third and final geisha in the auctions (NB - do NOT let your opponent in a 2p game get the third and final geisha - do you really need to be told this?)... And only one of those three games was actually mostly a horrible experience to play. The possibility of total and utter ignominous defeat makes the glorious victories possible all the sweeter.

Comparisons: Superficially like Waterdeep because you are sending out workers and completing missions for veeps. The game which it most seems to resemble to me though is Mechanisburgo - another rich, intense and thematic WP. Significantly, though, Yedo has simple and intuitive rules, Mechanisburgo does not. The thematic depth should appeal to players who hate dry euroism, but with the chaos being quite manageable if you play it that way, the game should also appeal to players who enjoy a thoughtful, dynamic system that creates efficiency puzzles to solve. 

Play time: Two player takes 1 hour, with 3 - 5 the play time creeps up, maybe maxing out at 2 1/2 hours with 5 players who like to consider their choices carefully. For me 2 1/2 hours is by no means too long to be playing one game, and indeed the experience of playing Yedo is comparable to those games which usually take 3-5 hours to play - so I don't hold with the 'too long' criticisms. 

Random nastiness: As noted, through using foresight actions, the randomness is all manageable I just don't see it as a fault at all. It creates an environment of risk - in which you may take chances or proceed with caution as you prefer. There are some great "Gah!" moments in this game. 

Take thatiness/blockinginess: A lot of opportunities to cause people hurt and to block people's plans. Again, I think the balance is about right. With 2 players it seems nastier because if you can get ahead then you can probably afford to just concentrate on stymying your opponent. Woe betide you if they manage to find a way through, though. At times then the game can feature INTENSE conflict and competition, but this tends to be periodic, generally not completely determining the outcome of a game (plenty of steps you can take, action cards you can arm yourself with to defend yourself against the ill-intentions of others) - the fact that it can sometimes be critical adds to the frisson of excitement that runs through the game - am I going to get royally screwed before (or worse just after) I get this game-clinching mission completed? 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Very much in the style of Princes of Florence, with worker placement and a fair few factors out of your control thrown in. It's a long and deep experience set amongst some beautiful, yet somewhat not entirely functional artwork.

Players will be looking to some early and easier green and yellow missions to build up some cash - you don't want to run out of cash, but it's so tempting to overreach. Then once you've built your palace a little and acquired a few weapons you can go for the points and bonus card earning red and black missions. it's all in the timing as you spend actions to reorder card (or weapons) stacks, then play a card or take an action that allows you to pluck just the right one off the top.

However, there's a certain amount of unpredictability thrown into the mix as players play cards against each other to foil the best laid plans. There's the potential for four against one ganging up on the leader to cancel their action cards, bonuses and whatnot to bring them back to the pack. I'm not sure this will sit well with some players who don't appreciate their best laid plans being messed with - it doesn't bother me so much, but for some people in a two plus hour game they're not going to like it one bit.

Finally, turn order is a problem. As with any game that mixes up the turn order from standard clockwise to higgledy-piggledy you'll find the game slows down as a result. With turns having the potential to be really quick in Yedo you need to have someone cracking the whip and reading out player colours from time to time. It detracts from the enjoyment in some ways, but it's sometimes necessary as in another way it improves the enjoyment by keeping the pace up.

Overall it's a decent game. I'd say Princes of Florence and Lords of Waterdeep fans that want the dial turned up to eleven will get a kick out of it if they're willing to dive into a longer game. Rules are easy to digest. It's certainly a good challenge with plenty of choices and lots to think about. I'm looking forward to bringing it to the table regularly.

It'll be interesting to see which will be the best medieval Japanese themed game of 2012, [i]Edo[/i] from Queen Games or [i]Yedo[/i] from eggertspiele. Both sound interesting. Strange... I'd be interested to hear from Queen Games and eggertspiele how they both happened to come up with the respective names and themes both in the same year. I'm sure there's a tale to tell there. I wonder which I will prefer? I'm intrigued, so I'll be ordering both, although Edo's Simultaneous Action Selection is not a mechanic I'm fond of.

Did Queen Games see the Wolf Plancke and Thomas Vande Ginste game before renaming and changing the theme of their game? Did the designers of the game now known as [i]Yedo[/i] ever submit their game to Queen Games for publishing? I'd be interested to know.

In the 2010 Hippodice competition [i]Altiplano[/i] won the Special award best “full-length“ game. (The title was subsequently changed to [i]Edo[/i].) There's a nice photo and description here:

http://www.hippodice.de/index.php?option=com_content&view=ar...

I'm wondering who at Queen Games decided to change the title to [i]Edo[/i] and the theme to medieval Japan and what inspired the change?

It is definitely too long. There are comparisons with Lords Of Waterdeep and Princes Of Florence—but I could play those other games three times in the time it takes to play this once. I know it was a learning game and 4 new players, but this took 4 hours. 

Speaking of 4 hours, did I mention we played for 4 hours and I lost because on the last turn Luke played a Backstab card on me that cost me 6 points (3 VPs on the Mission card, and then 3 VPs I would have bought in the Harbor with the money I won on that Mission)? Those 6 points would have tied us, and I had the tiebreaker. But...you know...Backstab. 

Also, every single "attack" card played in this game was played on me. That gets old fast. 

I don't blame people for playing the cards, or even for playing them on me. I blame a game that has those cards available in the first place. I hate that crap. And this was the "nice" version!

I don't actually mind the Events deck. It feels like the action that lets you look at those is important. 

My other biggest complaint—aside from length and the take-that cards—is that often there weren't interesting things to do with your meeples—especially if you get shut out of where you want to go. Maybe it was just me and poor play, but there seemed to be a LOT of turns where I basically said, "I guess I'll just go there" because good spots were taken. Then when it was my turn, I'd just take it off and skip the action, because I don't really give a crap about looking at the top three Weapons again. I'm good on weapons. Thanks. "Oh, I can look at Bonuses?" Looks at Bonuses and realizes he can't fulfill any of them. Sighs... 

The auction is very much Princes Of Florence, but I would just rather play that game, every time, over this one. 

Finally, we do some awful things over the course of the game. What were the categories? Theft. Kidnapping. Assassination. Warfare. And one other I'm forgetting. "Hey, I killed some guy's son! Go me!"

Anyway, some good stuff. Some more stuff I disliked.

Frustrating gameplay. Come up with a plan, watch it go all wrong. Way too long for the amount of randomness. Do not recommend with five players and probably not for four either. I don't see myself playing this again any time soon.

Yedo is a fun worker placement game with two primary problems; it lasts a little bit longer than I really want it too, and the cards are not very well balanced. If you came up with a some kind of starting auction that allowed each player to start the game with more stuff and then cut the game down by 3-4 rounds, that would help with the length. The card issue would require tweaking the cards or at least removing the most egregious cases. I really enjoyed my play, but these two issues make me doubt I'll seek it out again.

I contend that with Worker Placement, you like the first couple that you play, and everything else is the same, just dressed up differently, with a different language of action spaces. I 'grew up' on Pillars of the Earth and Stone Age and always benchmark against that. Yedo throws together a bunch of standard Euro mechanisms, and offers nothing new in that department. It's slightly more complex than Pillars, and has a lot of similar elements actually (action spaces that gain immunity to random event, the market, free-VP spot and money-for-VP spots, the concept of an 'auction' to acquire resources at below-market prices). 

What kills it though is that all info is Pillars is open, while there's a ton of hidden information in cards here. So this one's more like Egizia: you do your own little thing that nobody knows (usually), and get annoyed when somebody doing their own little thing accidentally intrudes on your space, or grab an opportunity to push, I mean, nudge your opponent, in the rare chance it comes up. I want to screw my opponent with gusto and deliberation, not because our hidden objectives arbitrarily clashed.

The game's not hard once you cut through the icon and action space fluff, and learn which arbitrary things go together at each action space. I would've expected sequencing the placement phase vs. activation phase, to be more involved, but seemed like the moves were no-brainer (i.e. of course I do this one, with more competition, first). Caylus or Dominant Species this is not, which isn't a plus when this game is slightly above Pillars-length.

The theme here is purely cosmetic - the kind where you can slap on any coat of paint you want onto the bare wood without any leap in imagination. I will only read flavor text if the card actually corresponds to what you're doing in the game in a clever way; games where something is a theft or assassination just because you turned in a bunch of arbitrary resources and, well, because the card insists so, have zero thematic integration.

An optimization, do-your-own-thing game, which makes it worse than your average worker placement that at least has some screwage interaction.

2+2

Played a 4player game at essen, but did not finish because we didn't have the time.
What a nice board and atmosphere. It's certainly not a light game, but after a few rounds of assistance everyone was able to play without needing assistance. It will need more games to start seeing strategic opportunities, but i'm willing to invest the time :)

A very solid game whose auction doesn't suffer with less players.  There is good artificial tightening of the board and I never felt like I was out of it.  Really like the card limits and the variety should be good going forward.  Very solid stuff with room to go up with additional plays.  My only negative was that it felt like it went a couple of rounds too long, but otherwise the game was enjoyable.

RATING: 1
Played this the same evening as my first game of LoW. (We played samurai variant)

Comparison with LoW cannot be avoided, so let's do it: 
- Graphic design of Yedo is terrible. Icons meld with the background, the layout of the cards leaves a lot to be desired. Once you kinda accept your fate, theme and Vohwinkel's illustration do creep up on you and the game does work thematically. Flavour text is a little bit more developed here. I'm not sure though if Yedo feels a bit more thematic just because it's longer. 
- Yedo is or at leaves gives the impression it's far more strategic and serious, you feel like the effort you put in the game while trying to win is returned (while LoW is more chaotic and tactical). The progression of quests in 4 difficulties is certainly a good idea and makes the game less random - on the other hand, most of the points you'll get just by black quests which take a while to achieve if luck is on your side (so it's hard to say how much of this is your effort). 
-  At the end of the day Yedo is everything but the kitchen sink euro design we've seen lately and ironically it's LoW that's more streamlined. In Yedo you have some old school auctions, some Princes of Florence scoring, some set collecting of various types (for VPs, weapons), a lot of worker placement, some action cars, some screwage and so on. As far screwage goes Yedo has a bit more of it, I'm just nor sure it's justified - it just means you have to stock up on action cards to finish the harder quests (probably with the aim of avoiding optimisation and reducing the luck of quest cards draw). 

Current evaluation: Thematic worker placement with an ugly map and some luck thrown in. Would be enjoyable if it wouldn't be too long for what it is and a having a bit too much brainburn than I find justified. I'll play LoW over this any time as it's quicker and more light hearted. Given that I'm certainly not a fan of neither heavier euros or worker placement genre. If this whole idea of quests would evolve around some other core than WP (area control any one?) I'd find it much more worthwhile and original. 

EDIT: Rating down to 1.0 because: uninspired.

Played once each with 2P and 4P. While Yedo doesn't really bring anything new to the table and will be inevitably compared to Lords of Waterdeep, it still is a good game in its own right. The main draw of Yedo is its thematic immersion, especially since its just a resource conversion game. The flavour text and the detailed requirements for completing missions go a long way in providing a reason behind fulfilling missions. The once around auction prior to the worker placement phase is also interesting as a lot of things are available at a cheaper price, so players will want to choose their auctions carefully. 

The main reservation I have concerning this game is its combination of long playing time (~3 hours with 4P) with random nasty events. In the last round of the 4P game, the Chastity Week event was revealed and effectively locked one player out from completing any missions, as all his missions required his disciple to be in the Red Light district. While you can mitigate luck by using an action to foresee upcoming events, I prefer if such swingy actions and events were toned down given the level of strategy the game requires. Other quibbles I have are the unbalanced endgame bonuses, as well as the rather superfluous Watch Patrol mechanism.

While the 2P game does run significantly shorter, it also de-emphasises the trading and auction phase which I enjoy due to the interaction those phases offer. So I found the 2P game too pared down for my liking.

I wasn't sure what to think about the addition of another worker placement game in our collection, but the mechanics in Yedo (set collecting and auction bidding) are different enough from what we own to keep it very interesting. I really like it and prefer it to Tzolk'in, our other heavy thematic WP game.

Unfortunately, James thinks the luck factor is much too high and, after 8 plays, has decided that he hates the game, so I don't expect to play this one much anymore.

I like the theme, art and general game play (worker placement works well with this theme).  But it's kind of a mess in a lot of ways.  I usually don't mind randomness in games if there are meaningful decisions, but there just seems too many aspects that are random in this for my taste.  I probably need to approach the game with a more beer & pretzel attitude.

Finally logged one 5p game. Not sure I love it, but it’s fun. Definitely very long. And I got hosed at the end by the flip of a tile that ruined any chance I had of competing. That felt like a waste of hours. And based on the whole “Lords of Waterdeep” depth, the length is a problem. Up for trade.

It has a lot of things in it I like better than Lords of Waterdeep. I like the bidding, trading, the quests feel incredibly thematic, the town watch adds a good bit of tension and player interaction, and the art design is heads and shoulders above. But it's harder to teach and significantly longer than LoWD. There's still too much luck (with the availability of the weapons especially) and with this being a longer game, that hurts it more than LoWD.

This game feels very much like the next gaming step from Lords of Waterdeep.  It is a worker placement game where players have missions they collect resources to complete.  Even the action cards in this game have a similar feel to the Intrigue cards from Lords of Waterdeep.

I quite like it.  The mission-completion gameplay is really fun and the worker placement mechanics are all very well balanced.  I especially like the threat of the watchman and the limited availability of some resources or the number of resources you can have at once force you to make decisions about which missions to pursue (along with bonus cards that can help direct your strategy).  This is both a deep but reasonably accessible game (though not as accessible as Lords of Waterdeep) and the theme is done pretty well.  All the missions and even some of the other cards have flavor text on them to help saturate the game with even more theme.

One of the major complaints with this game is the length for what it is.  BGG says 2.5 hours and that's probably about right for a 4 or 5 player game.  With 2 or 3 you're probably flirting with 2 hours.  And that is long for a reasonably accessible worker placement game but like I said, it is very deep and I didn't feel like it was taking too long for what it was.  I enjoyed my experience quite a bit.

A worker placement described as "Lords of Waterdeep" on steroids with a bit more direct conflict, as you can purposefully remove other players' workers from their available pool and cancel their actions with cards. Can drag on quite a bit with new players. Production values are great, though.

First play. This looks intimidating when you set it up. Once you start playing it all comes together very logically. Smooth play with a sense of build up and progress. We forgot to do the event card twice which may have changed our game a bit. Jessica very much enjoyed it. That's a major plus. 

The mission text and what you have to do correspond thematically well.  I did miserable in collecting elements to complete missions. Jessica picked up on it right away. Tough decisions pop up when working out the harder cards to complete. Easy missions are very apparent in what you have to do. It ramps up to major forward planning for the hardest cards. The payoffs are worth it.

Point making can be scrappy or handed out as handsome rewards. There is also the possibility of interplay with board actions. I think we saw it with the harbor and the money making green cards. I hope to explore these synergies. Maybe the yellow/red cards have a path reflected in board actions as well?

First world complaint : I wish the cardboard tokens in the game were a bit thicker.

Okay, I'm being a little harsh and if this game was only six rounds or so, I'd probably quite like it, but I started getting bored of the repetition by round six and we were only half way through. Add to that, the random swingy events and the take-that cards and this is a mess of noise, chaos and luck.

Oh, I almost forgot. With the hidden 'shopping lists', you have no way of judging the relative values of each spot to each player. Need to get two, or even three, dudes into specific spots to complete a mission? Good luck. That's precisely what you'll need.

Alright.  There was a lot to like in this game.  It is decidedly Euro of course, but it is dripping with theme.  It combines many great mechanics from other games and weaves an enjoyable game out of it.

However, it is also very long.  Heading into epic game lengths, but unfortunately not delivering an epic game feel.  I'm told less players makes it play a bit faster, and this information lends me to want to try it again sometime, as I enjoyed the game.

You are easily frustrated when the game or the other players throw a wrench in your plans. At some point throughout the game, it is very likely that somebody will be huffing and puffing.  
 
You are going to play this with 5 players. The game easily takes about 4 hours with 5 players, unless you are planning to play it constantly (and with the same players)so that everybody knows the game really well. It will still take about 3 hours with five players though.

Hey, we had a great time to make yedo! 

And we have even a greater time following the game up here on the geek. So if you have comments, we are always available to hear from you. We try to thank and talk to the people playing and rating the game. 

Getting good comments is great, getting badones is interesting and we learn from it. So don t hesitate to let us know what you think about the game.

Of course we are glad with good ratings. But ratings itself is not our biggest interest. Though a bad rating always triggers us to know why... So maybe we learn and can do better in the future. We do talk to the people playing the game. If we contact you, it s to know why and to learn more about your thoughts. 

Thank you all for playing , rating and esspeccially

This game is fantastic!  It is essentially Lords of Waterdeep plus plus for me.  The game is a bit more complex than LoW, with additional mechanics such as bidding.

I really enjoy this game. It does take a few rounds to get going, and to get a feel for the decisions/options you have in the game, but once you're there, it feels good.

I enjoy the thematic integration. You can spice the game up a ton if you decide to read all the flavor text. But this comes at the cost of time, so we just read the really special ones. A lot of the flavor text has good humor in it; it always has interesting and applicable content.

The game does a good job of keeping players engaged in my groups. The scoring is tight, disallowing any strong pull-aways in the score. There's also a good amount of challenge-vs-reward. Some missions are incredibly hard and besides the green missions, there's always some kind of challenge--especially with the watch guard--but the reward tacked onto every mission is usually fitting with the effort put in to achieve it, with the exception of a few ...strange missions.

I'd be happy to play this game any time. It immediately goes into my Top 10 worker-placement games.

RATING: 9
Absolutely solid, delightful, devilishly and deliciously devious worker placement. Dripping with theme, in fact this is more of a thematic game backed up with solid euro mechanics. 
We've only played 2-player so far but it's very enjoyable and I can see how the player tension and interaction will only get better with more players at the table. 
This inevitably gets compared to Lords of Waterdeep, but it is a far deeper, thoughtful and, in my opinion and experience, more enjoyable game. I find LoW rather dry and the theme doesn't appeal to me (I've played with a set that had meeples instead of cubes, and metal coins - that was more fun!). I still enjoy playing it and have fun with my group, but I find Yedo a far richer experience. 
People have commented on the long playing time - obviously with 2 people it plays quicker, but I've been fairly caught up in the game and not noticed the passing of time. 
There have also been negative comments about the 'take that' aspect. Horses for courses I guess. We love it! My wife delights in playing mind games during the Bidding Phase, and the pain and thrill of planning your comeback following a Tsunami or Earthquake is a reason we sit at the table to play boardgames in the first place. 
I've rated 8 for 2-player for now, but will review and revise once we've played 3+

This game is most like Lords of Waterdeep, but implements a Japaneese theme, adds random events, changes which location is unavailable on a turn, and throws in some auctions and trading. What it adds offsets the additional randomness it brings. The most notable difference from LoW is that the quests actually feel like quests. You feel like you are actually achieving things rather than just getting cubes.

I will be honest and direct: I really liked this game! It is smart, fun, with many mechanics that work really well together, and also make players actually involved one with the other - first because there is an auction phase, but also because of the fight for spaces (something usual for a work placement), the trading (which require players to be in one of two regions of the board, so is necessary to talk beforehand), the use of action cards. Yedo has a fine space for strategy, while requiring tatical thinking, to work around restrictions given by the Events (and the Patrol), and also to work as fast as possible to fulfill some missions. The missions are an excellent tool to make the players really do about everything in the game - in the end of a play it will be unsual if a player hasn't used almost all the actions in the board. Our play, in five (four learning it) took us around 3+ hours, but everyone was excited with the game, and it appeared to be less time.

Also, considering the amount of things you can do in a given round, it is surprisingly easy to have a grasp of the rules and the flow of the game right from the start - it could be that this is because of the explanation that the owner gave to us, but I guess that this happened also because of the game itself, where everything works well and is knitted together. The Events can really hurt one or other players (in our game, the Earthquake affected only two players, and both lost a disciple and a building, while the other three weren't affect at all - so, the two players that suffered the full effect were sent back almost to the start of the game - the event occurred in the third round), but the game allows for some control over this: some of the Events can be lessened or even totally avoided by the use of a blessing token, and also, it is possible to use the Temple to see the next three Events and then you can prepare somewhat for them.

There is luck in the game? Yes, a good deal, by the way: from the Events, as I mentioned, but mostly in the Missions: in the auction phase, the player that takes the missions spot, can take three cards from the same stack and keep one of them - this helps a lot with the lick aspect; but using the Castle District you only take the topmost card in one of the piles, and this one can be something you are already close to do, or something that will take you a lot of actions/trades to accomplish (for example, two times in the game, happened that after a player took a mission card, using the Castle, that mission was already "made"). But, again, the luck of the draw is lessened by the use of a building: the Yashiki, that, when used, allows the player to trade one mission card in his hand and draw a new one. So, as you can see, the game do have luck, however all of is aspects have something in the game that works against it (like looking the top three cards of a stack - an action allowed by the Port, the Gate and the Temple, or look the top three weapons in the stack - this can be made in the Tavern; all of this will, for example, allow you to make a more sound decision in the next bidding phase).

One thing that also happened in our game was: if you lose an disciple because of the Patrol, things can enter in an spiral of bad things: because losing a disciple, not only means that you have one less worker, but also can signify that you won't be able to fulfill a mission, and because of this will be out of money, and won't be able to use your disciple in other place, which might prevent you do another mission next round - things, as I said, are knitted closely in the game, and one lost action/disciple can screw the timming of your whole game up to that point. So you must be [u]really[/u] careful with the Patrol. [thing=117915][/thing] is also unforgiving if you lag behind: there isn't any catch up mechanism, the only "catch up" is given by the actions of others: if you are ahead, you might find it difficult to trade, and also you might end up in the receiving end of some nasty action cards effects. But other than this, no - you will just have to work hard in order to try to catch up.

I saw some people comparing [thing=117915][/thing] with [thing=110327][/thing]. Well, I can see from where they come from: in both games the victory points come from fulfilling missions. But this is about it. [thing=117915][/thing], for me, is a richer game, with much more interaction between players. Also, [thing=117915][/thing] has more moving parts, and it takes longer to play more, which makes it less of a option as a gateway game, or a game to play with occasional players - [thing=117915][/thing] fits well for gamers.

The only thing I think it could be a missed opportunity is that the clans in the game - Hosokawa, Nabeshima, Toyotomi, Sanada and Maeda - aren't different in any game aspect, except in color and art. I know it is really hard to make different "powers" while keeping the balance of the game, but it still would be nice to have little things, like if the Sanada clan could use any weapon as a rope, or if, once in the game the Nabeshima could gain the bonus of a mission without having one of the requirements. I don't know about balance, but I would sure like that the clans would be a little unique. Anyway, a small complain, as it was a joy to play even without this.

RATING: N/A
A worker placement and quest completion game, it's - broadly speaking - a more complicated Lords of Waterdeep with a Japanese theme. It's pretty good overall but generates a fair bit screwage when other players take that critical spot you needed. This sort of thing is inevitable in worker placement games, but Yedo seems to me to have a higher amount of it than many others and this tends to turn me off.

Yedo is a typical worker placement game, with only a few surprises. It is also a pretty long game (2,5 hours for our first three player game). So I should not like it as much as I do! Whether it was because of the quick turns, the great atmosphere (no pasted on theme here!), the beautiful board or the perfect amount of player interaction, I do not know, but I felt engaged the entire time and was sorry when it was finally over. Cannot wait to play again.

This game disappoints when tries to join a gamer's game with random and "take that!" elements. On one hand, there's almost everything that serious euros can have - worker placement, auctions, little money, lots of choices, some of them not so easy. But, in the other hand, there's a lot of 'take that!' cards and random elements that absolutely don't 'fit' in the serious game it was supposed to be. When you spend almost three hours doing everything right to fulfill a very good mission and earn lots of points, and someone just play a card saying you're gonna score half the points - this is SO frustrating. That's why I'll probably never play it again.

Geisha and Samurai variants. After our second play we had a mixed reaction. On the one hand, the game has several interesting ideas, but on the other hand, we felt that there are two serious negatives: 1) there are too few means to mitigate randomness (e.g. from event cards, watch-patrol manipulation or from other sources) and 2) the game felt too long. 

Update: having tried the game again, I've given up on it: too long, too random, too arbitrarily destructive, ...

A great mid-weight worker placement game.  It plays exceptionally well at 2P and the little watchman doesn't become too punishing (which we like).  There is a lot going on in this game with a lot of choices available.

Pros:
+ Nice artwork
+ Unique theme that comes through stronger than LoW
+ Plenty of opportunity for you to choose your own strategy (lots of easy missions or fewer hard ones?  or maybe earning points other ways?)
+ Different enough to earn a place on the shelf alongside other similar games

Cons:
- Set-up takes a little longer than some other games
- Board uses a lot of iconography that can have you reaching for the rulebook a lot your first couple of plays
- Not as easy to teach to a new player as other mid-weight WP, such as Coal Baron

Only one play so far, maybe five was too many.  The game went too long and it felt extremely tight. A lot of aspects I liked, but was a bit let down expecting a "more advanced Lords of Waterdeep". It kind of felt just more restricting and convoluted. The constant inability to enter certain zones was a frustrating restriction. There was too much luck involved in the final point tally.  Feels like the game boils down to a constant searching and exchanging of cards and hoping you luck out to get the better ones.

I'm not generally a member of the Cult of the New, but Yedo has me smiling from ear to ear.  The designers took the best aspects of many of the games that I love and somehow threw all of it together into a bag and dumped out the most elegant and intricate design that I have ever played.  Although Euro-mechanical in nature, the parts of the machine link together like clockwork to propel the gamer into a Feudal Japanese adventure of assassination, thievery, kidnapping, espionage, and warfare.  Although there is a lot going on with the board and a player's options, even new players start to get the hang of everything after only a few turns.  My very few and small complaints are about inconsistencies with the components (the meeples are of different sizes and the money chits are a bit on the cheap side), and slight vagueness in the rule book (mostly due to imperfect language translation) but these are incredibly minor and only worth mentioning because I think they are my ONLY complaints.  The artwork and aesthetics are beyond superb and really help to submerge the gamer into the theme.  Some will think the game a tad long, but with repeated plays I believe even a group of 5 could get in a rhythm and finish consistently around the 2-hour mark.  I am truly impressed with this game and with the designers, who are almost obsessed with personally responding to every question, complaint, or comment on the forums.  You may hear other games compared to Yedo, but those comparisons will not be fair.  Yedo is in a different league.

Way too long for what it is, extremely mean and random.  New players are always kneecapped and have to now sit and play a game for 3 or 4 hours that they have NO chance in winning.  I say this as someone who is past that and has a good chance of winning.

While you can take different level missions at the start of the game, the only intelligent move is to take the easier ones, and as the game goes on take the next level of easier, as completing missions is the WHOLE GAME.  If you fail to complete your early missions, or you waste your money once, you are out of the race for the rest of the game.

The random events can be devastating and can ruin multiple rounds worth of effort.  You sometimes can't complete a mission for a 1/3 of the game because a single weapon isn't available, or all of one type of room has been bought.  You can lose a worker permanently that you just spent a ton of money buying.  Being mean to other players is one thing, but this game just ruins your whole plans which is not fun, and often it randomly happened.

Ordered from Germany and had to wait 7 weeks or so to receive.  But boy was it worth the wait!

The game is an interesting mix of mechanics and while I can see the comparisons to Lords of Waterdeep as well as Princes of Florence, the game does feel unique. 

The flavor txt on the cards is fun, the items and placement required all make sense which also adds to the enjoyment.  The board is big and well laid out, the cards are as well.  

Rating dropped a little, as it's become a game "I'm good with playing" but often it's not top on my list.

(Sept 2013 - after 1 5p game) - 3 newbies in my only game and they finished 1/2/3.   

Interesting worker placement game that had very high tension at this player count.    There is a bit of nasty in this game with event cards, limited spaces to place your disciple and that red/blue watchman dude in the middle.   I don't mind games where you have to manage bad things (such In the Year of the Dragon - events or Notre Dame - rats).

Our 5p learning game went long (3+ hours with rules) and I hope it speeds up on future plays as we get experienced with the options available to us.   

Enjoyable - I think this will hit a lot over the coming months.  Really hope to speed up those players prone to AP, but not much where they are making mistakes due to speed of play.

Very good worker placement game spiced up with an additional auction phase and a random event each round. Very tight economy with few ways to make money and much to spend it on. Quite cutthroat in both the auction, worker placement, control of the watchman and a few "take that" action cards.

Only downside is the long playing time. Played very quickly a 5-player may be done in 2 hours but 3 hours are more likely. However, it never feels long as you are involved and busy making interesting decisions all the time.

RATING: 7
A fun way to spend the night if you have time to kill, a 5 player count, and no better games to play. This game IS fun and the art and cards are beautiful BUT the randomness of the game can cost you victory and is impossible to mitigate every turn. I got lucky and won but could have been unlucky on 1 more turn and lost by the same token. Player interaction here feels high but is deceptive as it mostly involves blocking other players with action selection due to limited spaces on the board. Because the missions you need to fill are secret, players don't really know what others need, so there is no true "take that" blocking most of the time. Also, pretty long at four hours for five players. I'd play this again but not over better things probably. 

Edit: not bad at two. Still satisfying and definitely plays much faster. Drawbacks are that the trading is almost non-existent and there isn't as much fighting for turn-order but the bidding still feels contentious because several of the spaces are grouped together in a 2 player game as does blocking via the action spaces because 10 spaces are covered. There isn't much trading in a 4 or 5 player game anyway, beyond haggling, so I don't miss that, and I'd say the slightly diminished fighting over turn-order/bidding is worth it when it cuts 3 hours from a game. I'd still play it at higher player counts but probably not with people who are prone to really bad AP.

You've probably heard that this is a souped up version of Lords of Waterdeep and that's an apt comparison. The basic goals of the two games are much the same, but the path you take to get there couldn't be more different. Lords of Waterdeep is a pretty straight forward worker placement game. Yedo adds auctions, trading and negotiations to the mix for a much deeper experience.

The price of all this extra stuff is about an hour and a half longer play time. I think the added complexities are worth the time, but those that dislike the game do have a valid complaint. The game also features the gotcha cards of Waterdeep, which can be an issue when they sabotage the final mission of the game. Three hours of build up to have the rug pulled out from under you can be a very demoralizing experience.

I try to play around them, since I know they are coming...but your first time through it's easy to get blindsided. If you can get over it and come back for a few more plays, you'll have a much better time of it, as the stories that emerge from your completed missions are thematic gold.

Whoever said it is like a complex version of Lords of Waterdeep was right on. Same basic idea, with a ton of bells and whistles bolted on.

While I really want to like Yedo, it just overstays its welcome.  For what it is, it just takes too long.  If it would have been 7-8 turns, it would have been more fun.  The last 3 turns just drag on.

Where Waterdeep is streamlined and fast, Yedo is long and bloated.  While I like all the parts of Yedo, there just isn't enough to like for as long as it takes.

The first game I bought this year in Essen at Spiel 2012. Quite expensive €46. But the graphics are magnificent. I saw the 2 designers, nice chaps by the way. A really cool game, good mechanics, many roads to victory, I love the Nippon theme, the events can be quite nasty if you play the samoerai version, but the depth of the game is splendid. 
Edit 1 : If you don't like the harsh events, just play the Gheisa version ... I like the the harsh events, but my wife doesn't. Great game.

We are clan elders in early Feudal Japan seeking favor of the new Shogun completing missions under the cover of darkness and by usually nefarious means.  I originally passed this one up, but later heard it is LoW with meat and  I completely agree. Kidnapping, assassinations, Geishas and the like were initially a turn off but we could not help getting consumed by the rich theme and immersed in our clandestine affairs.  It is a long game but so much fun to play. Building annexes, harsh event cards, avoiding the night watch. encourages trade amongst players which is essential given the stingy resources. So glad I gave this a second look.

The mechanics of this game are quite good. It feels tight, not too random, and satisfying in terms of strategic options. What makes it really work, if you ask me though, is the flavor text on the cards. I know this tends to get ignored in a lot of games as they progress, but honestly it's some of the best in game writing I've seen. I'm not a huge Japanophile either, but I bet it really applies to people who are. It's really atmospheric, and it lends a real sense of story to the more abstract elements of the game.

Its not a bad game. Prefer by far Lords of Waterdeep. The problem it has on a 5 players game is that is way too slow with a lot of possibilities for delays in the decision making process.

Again, its not that it is not fun, but there are plenty other games that provide the entertainment more fluidly and in far less time.

I'm sure I dislike this game for the same reasons that many other people like it, but oh well!

This game takes far too long to play, 11 rounds is simply too many. The game grows tiring after round 8, but play still continues from there for at least another hour.

The game has too many "screw you" mechanics, mostly coming from the game itself, not the other players.  Negative player interaction is present, but fairly limited. The game's event cards are just brutal, and if you play with the Samurai event cards, you may as well just give up before you start.

The actions seemed far too limited. I always knew what I wanted to do, but there are so few ways to actually get what you need.

Thematically and component wise, I am very impressed.

And it's the combination of these two that really ruins the game: if you are behind, you have less power to protect yourself from negative events. If you are doing well, you have the ability to direct the negative events towards other players. Disappointing.

Typical decent Euro, but almost every aspect of the game you have already seen before.  I was hoping for the historical theme to come through stronger.  However, the theme felt very pasted on.  It did not really matter if I was conducting an assassination or something pretty benign (find out who's coming to the morning ceremony), it still felt like I was just collecting various items.  I may as well have been collecting apples or wood.  The main area where the theme is intended to shine are the various missions.  However, many of the missions are laughable - obtain the geisha house's guest book or learn what will be on the tavern's menu next week.  Ooh, I feel the Japanese theme dripping now.  The worker placement is a little bland.  There rarely seems to be enough decent options for your workers.  Getting two victory points for simply buying a geisha or annex seems out of whack compared to what you have to do to get the same number of victory points via missions.

Similar to Princes of Florence, but with a lot more going on. 
This does not make the game better though, on the contrary.

In Princes of Florence, you can seek synergies between your cards since you only draw missions in the first half of the game, in Yedo you draw them all game long and have to have the luck that your missions mostly fit the stuff you already have. Also 2 out of 3 possibilities to draw new mission cards dont automatically come with a way of choosing, you just draw 1 off the top. 

Also, other players moving the warden extra after you in turn order f***s you up big time.

The quick start rules are VERY ambiguous, but this looks like a really easy to use and fun minis rule set. It reminds me of Savage Worlds' skirmish rules, but it looks simpler and faster and squad based. It looks like it would work for man-to-man combat, as well; just let players group individuals into temporary firegroups at the beginning of each turn, so you can move people freely around and focus several attacks on enemies when you need to.

Action/Reaction system keeps games fluid and interesting for both sides all the time. Basic rules are easy enough to pick up on and get a game going. Emphasis on morale and training instead of weapons lists seems suitable for the subject era. Works well for solitaire play if opponents are hard to come by.

RATING: 4
The basic system is playable and interesting once you get it, but requires some effort to learn. Many of the minor/situational rules are badly thought out and some were clearly not playtested at all. Example: If playing by the rules, it is not possible to hit a Huey with a Vietnam era RPG, the math is wrong. The Osprey version feels like a copy and paste job from their original Ambush Alley books with randomly added extra stuff to make it more complicated.

The basic concepts are easy to digest and put the focus on the tactics while abstracting details (facing, insignificant differences between weapons, etc.) that bog other games down.  Easily playable in two tense hours.  

Rules presentation leaves quite a bit to be desired, but it's worth learning.  What I found was that everything seemed perfectly clear while reading, but got muddled on the table.  But even muddled, we've had some great games and rereading the rules has brought things into better focus with each game.

Update:  I still think this is the best miniatures game I've played, but the die rolling is starting to seem excessive.  And I have yet to find a truly balanced scenario.

Clean, fast, reasonably simple set of modern skirmish rules. My only quibble is how morale tests are resolved. I'd rather have a 2d6 system where you have to beat x with a -1 penalty for every casualty to the unit. Elites might need to beat a 3. Militiamen might need to beat a 6.

Temporary rating: I suspect it reads better than it can be used as a reference, but I've already noted some good design concepts in but two readings

Finally read through the infantry setion of the rules. These are the best written set of miniature rules that I have seen in years. I will give it an 8 just for that, but have not played yet. I do not rate till I play. Still worried about scaling. I have 6mm figures and terrian.

Fun, easy mechanics but fiddly with casualty and other specific situations. Also, as expected for asymmetrical warfare, very one sided in situations. Prepare to be beaten down if the side you play isn't a world power.

fof is a relatively "simple" modern skirmish game of the action-counteraction genre, very rich in detail and very fun to play, once mastered. So, for these merits it deserves a sound 8.

more on subsequent plays...

I find the rules to be interesting and some of the ideas fresh. I wish the rules wereeasier to follow though. I also wish I could use their forum. Seems like a good community once you can get in.

Gearing up for simulating tactical conflicts for Somalia and Middle East conflicts.  Starting out with some 1/72 infantry, and some diecast tanks, helos, HMMWVs, and Bradleys, 20mm buildings with removal roofs and/or backs, and some assorted terrain.

If this works out for quick fun play at this scale, looking to use this as a base for man-to-man modern warfare for other theaters: NATO & 80's WW3, Korea, China, US invaded.

Keeping this all 20mm/ 1/72 scale. 

As with other tactical systems, going to start with the simplest rules and infantry only, then slowly add other rule components.

I've leafed through the main book and have started building forces for some of the theater books.  I do have some concerns on in-game rule referencing, so I will start slow and solo, and will create living reference cards for step-by-step play and tables, at least enough so I don't have to keep referencing the books while playing.

More a set of miniature rules than a boardgame.  Picked this up recently when I was looking for some modern tactical rules.  It looks very interesting and informative, but haven't used these rules yet.

I'm probably more interested in the book as a source for information and to see how the author's recommend handling things like morale, ecumbrance and such, to see if I might be able to use this info to address similar topics in some of the board games that I play.

RATING: 7.5
On the plus side there are some solid ideas for 'kinetic' skirmish battles here. The system emphasises differences between regular and irregular forces and has a strong focus on troop quality. A lot of scenarios are built around assymetry. 

The game's coverage of the subject matter is comprehensive. Table sizes and forces are accessibly small. The gameplay has a lot of back and forth and tends to resolve things simply and quickly. On the whole it eschews 'rivet counting' of weapons systems, except for the few occasions where it doesn't and is infuriatingly vague (such as on the definitions of SAWs).

On the minus side the presentation is slick but the rules writing and organisation very poor. There's a lack of clarity on some rules hindered by inconsistent use of terminology. The reaction rules, for example, are the heart of the game, but the description leads to much headscratching.

I have some doubts about the morale system, because it is based on the number of active soldiers and not on the number of casualties (if you lose 90% of your unit, or just a few men, you can get almost the same probabilities of making or failing the throw).

With this and some other few rules I don't completely like (but easily changed), I find Force on Force a wonderful wargame system: it is fast, it is easy but - suprise! - it is often an accurate simulation of tactical modern warfare. I expect to play this a lot in the future.

Looking for the perfect set of modern rules.  Haven't found them, but this comes pretty close.

I was surprised to see one owner commenting that he artwork in this and a few other Ambush Alley games was poor quality.  He must not think much of Osprey publications, books that I use all the time for painting my game figures.  Amazingly, that individual only seems to like the artwork of a couple of board games, so perhaps minis are not his cup of tea.

Really enjoyable, well written and well produced book.  the game is simple to learn, but has enough detail to make it interesting and challenging, whilst giving fairly plausible results.

Having said that, its quite complex.

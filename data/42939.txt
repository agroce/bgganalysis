RATING: 4.5
As with all Flying Frog games, it is yet another 1980's style romp game. All of them feel like the last fight of an RPG - minus the story and interesting saga leading up to it. Frog games sit somehow between Steve Jackson and Fantasy Flight - unable to reach to really solid designs, but still managing a passable bit of silly fun without the terrible design of Jackson. This one I found better than Last Night on Earth, but only marginally. I like the theme better for one. And it seems like the Martian player(s) has much more to do. Still, the game lingers too long for me and easily becomes a slog. It is designed to let dice rolls work against both enjoyment and yet encourage duration. A great roll makes for a memorable moment, but a sequence of lousy rolls makes you long to be playing something else. Over all, one of the better Frog games in my estimation, but not something I find too compelling.

my son's game (he's 8 as of getting this) he enjoys the game and it's theme.  I think its an alright game but i'd recommend last night on earth instead. I just did not get into the game that much. one of the first games I ever seen that you can play this game TOGETHER with last night on earth for a more epic game. very strange and fun at the same time (the first time that is). some of the rules are not explained as well as I would like so you have to spend alil more time going to the website for clarifications first.

Man I liked this game - it was familiar enough to LNOE to get us moving but the new mechanics (especially for the aliens) are a welcome change. For some reason the theme added even more levity than LNOE. Hoping they will add an expansion to flesh out the deck more.

What an absurdly fun game.  I completely impulse-bought this one when Last Night on Earth wasn't in stock at my local game shop, and it turned out to be one of my favorite games in my entire collection.  When they say "no two games are ever the same," they aren't lying.  The only thing keeping its score down is that it can be easy for one side to get frustrated if things just don't go very well for a couple turns in a row.

Just like many of their other games, Flying Frog Productions has a game here that is very thematic, quick, and fun. Love the different scenarios and just the thought of circus freaks versus aliens is cool. The components are top notch and the stories that play out are always unique. Games are always close and it's hard to tell who could win at any given time. Love this style of game!

A dicefest game that is fairly similar to the game Last Night on Earth.  Too much time and effort for too little fun.  The constant dodging and shrugging off of hits... and the pile of sneaky action cards of the martians got to be kind of annoying.

RATING: 10
Ok, it's American trash, however, there is enough stuff, actions, in this game, especially for the Martian player, to make this a very good beer and pretzel game. 

The problem with zombies is, well they are just dumb, like being attacked via of a slow moving potted plant, not so the Martians.

The carnival theme grows on you. Think of Orson Welles' War of the Worlds and the Martians landing in a traveling carnival, imagine their surprise.

The Big Top providing enough to divided up the playing board, a buffer structure, something to deal with, versus open space and buildings only off around the perimeter to use.

This is a game that needs the miniatures painted, the dip method works well for this. I used Pledge Future Wax in the dip as Miniwax is pricey and dealing with safety issues of oily rags is not something I want to deal with. I also used pure Pledged Wax to glue on the Martians's helmets via of applying, filling the collar rings of the Martians's space suits. This stuff doesn't seem to fog the helmets after it dries if you get some on it like glue.


Within its ilk, a 10. More of a crazy enjoyable romp then a serious endeavor.

At the end of the day, this is essentially a combat game with a theme that came out of a cheesy 50s sci-fi B-movie.  With all the random cards and dice rolls going on, there is a high level of luck involved.  Despite the fact that I don't like combat or luck, I still found myself enjoying the game.  Not really sure why, but at least for now I'm willing to give it a few more trys.

RATING: 8
While it runs on the exact same game engine as Flying Frog's Last Night on Earth, the martians vs. carnival theme allows this game to stand on its own.

If, of course, you are charmed by the concept.  

If not, there is probably much to dislike.

I find it a hoot and actually prefer it to LNoE.  Not only do I find the theme a kooky blast - but Flying Frog Productions introduced a ton of game concepts with Invasion that would eventually seep its way back into LNoE.  In many ways, Last Night on Earth owes just as much back to its kookier cousin. 

Most importantly:  The martians are simply much more fun to control than the zombies of Last Night.  It is not even close.

More FFP goodness. It's very similar to LNoE, yet the martians plays sufficiently different from the zombies for it to require different tactics. Letting the rules allow crossovers between the two games is brilliant. IFoS is a good game on it's own, but almost an expansion to LNoE.
They're so interchangable, it's hard not to consider the whole just one game.

It's just like Last Night on Earth, but with Martians!  And best of all - it is fully compatible with LNoE as well

The Power Tokens give the Hero team more options than ever before and the Martians have some really cool things that they can do using the Command Console. As a result, this game ends up being much more tactical and strategic than LNoE - especially if you are used to playing the Zombies.

Considering how much LNoE really started to shine with its expansions - I just can't wait to see what the Froggers have up their sleeves for expansions for this game.

Ordered by 12spiel, Germany, and got as reply they took the wrong game in the "sale" and that was the reason they sent a different game to me... for the same price...!? At least I should have been asked.

I have to send the wrong game back and will receive ...nothing? Not really nice. Unfortunately not the first time I had problems with 12spiel ...but I'm sure the last time. Will reply what's happen after I have sent back the game. They have still my money.


After sending back the wrong game, i heard nothing..., two weeks later I sent a reminder... "Hello...?" ...and finally got my money back without any apologize or comment... 

Paid back with PayPal, so I HAD TO PAY PAYPAL FEE for their mistake... ! IDIOT'S

Couldn't more worse? Thanks a lot for this lesson.
 
DON'T PURCHASE FROM 12SPIEL, GERMANY !

I like that this is fully compatible with last night on earth.
Again components are top quality and a spooky soundtrack is included which is great.

Aliens are harder again for the survivor players to survive. I also like that the helmets aren't stuck on so that you can paint the models without first having to rip off the clear plastic bit, not that it detracts from the game if the models aren't painted.

I would like to play this more.

If Last Night on Earth is a 10 this is an 11.  However, if you did not like LNoE you will not like this either.  They are very much alike, IfOS has a few tweeks that I feel make it play even better.  I feel the Heroes have a slight edge unless the Martians get some good tech cards out first.  But, overall it is a fun game and that is what matter most.

RATING: 7
I like the LNOE (Last Night on Earth) game mechanics. I picked up the game via a trade with the intentions of integrating Martians into the LNOE setting. I really don't like the setting or characters concept of circus folk. I find most of the humor, such as "Small Hands" and "Smells Like Cabbage" cards, misses the mark. Yes - I am familiar with the reference. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
An interesting strategic/tactical game using the Last Night on Earth game engine and a odd but very well done Carnival setting. The basic rules are very familiar to anyone who knows LNOE, but have been tweaked and altered in many ways,  large and small, so that the Martians really do feel like Martians and not Zombies in disguise. The Heroes are also more powerful to counteract their strong enemies and the board has a lot of really neat new concepts (like the permanent cannon spaces or the Fun House). 

The components are the same quality as LNOE (above avg.), although it was probably a bad idea to give the martian troops such long guns (they bend too easily), and the whole thing has a great atmosphere. I actually like it a lot more than I expected (Carnival theme didn't sound too promising to me). My only complaint is the Alien saucer tokens don't look much like ships. We fixed that by using alien saucer figures from Conquest of Planet Earth.

there's that half point.  I need to re-rate it a 7 or 8 later.  Probably a 7.  It did seem horribly weighted to the aliens.  I remember feeling that way about the Zombies in LNoE though too.  Then I read that it's considered a given that the humans are at a disadvantage.  Well, now I feel it's a challenge.

I might have liked it more if it had come out before Last Night on Earth. Still, this game has nothing to offer that LNoE doesn't. The changes it makes are not improvements: power tokens just add more randomness, the scenarios are not as interesting, and the sides are much too similar. The asymmetry worked so much better in LNoE. The theme (carnies) really doesn't grab me as much either. It feels so much more fiddly, with various minor rules and procedures being just slightly different. The game is so similar to LNoE I just can't see ever wanting to play this one instead of it.

Flying Frog board game in which the heroes are circus people fending off a Martian invasion. It uses a lot of Last Night On Earth's mechanics -- with the added twist of automatic range attack for the Martians (which heroes can roll to avoid) and Martians can group up to three as one unit. If you like Flying Frog, you'll enjoy this one.

BIG PLUS: easy to learn, quality of pieces (Martians get clear helmets!), theme
MINUS: basic game is imbalanced to the humans

MEGA-HUGE PLUS:
the game comes with instructions on how to merge this with Last Night On Earth so you can have humans vs Martians vs zombies!!!

RATING: 8
Played twice in a row. Humans got kicked around like a soccer ball both times. Maybe we need to reread the rules?
Edit: Reread rules and we were playing right. :) Played humans again and got lucky on our picks. Martians lost, but we needed quite a bit of luck a few times. Barely squeaked out of some tense situations.

Not as good as LNOE to me.
Yet.  I need more practice before I can call this rating good or bad.

After 2 more plays, I saw my first Hero Win.  It was actually pretty glorious, so we will see.  It restored my faith a little.

New Update:  Game is still carnie impossible.  I don't care what you have to say about "learning curve."  I am decreasing my score, because this doesn't seem balanced.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
The Good: With the right group, this one is tremendous fun. Great theme, and components !! Love the wacky B-Movie theme of Martians attacking circus performers. Love the circus performers special skills. The balance is good so far. Heroes lost the first game handily, but managed a last minute win in the second. The Martian player is not a dumb role - lots of meaningful decisions to make.

The Bad: Long playing time: it took us 4-5 hours. This game is rules heavy (due to implementing the theme). Once you get started, the rules start falling into place and it is not that bad. Select a Martian player that has patience because he will experience significant downtime while waiting each turn for the heroes to strategize and then for every single hero to complete their turn.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Okay, this is one of the few games that I'm willing to play twice in a row.  I like this a lot better than Last Night on Earth, frankly.  It makes sense that the martians, as opposed to the zombies, move intelligently.  Also, the new power tokens for the carny heroes are cool and the command console for the martians is an ingenious way to increase the martian tactical options without adding complexity.  Really, I like both this and LNOE, but this feels like a better game mainly because the martians are more fun to play than the zombies.  All in all, it adds up to a fantastic experience that is perfect for those times when you want to throw some dice and laugh at the spectacle playing out on your table.

Its the same system as LNoE, which I like. But it looses something in this translation. It seems like much more of a dice-rolling power fest, and less of a game.

RATING: 8
This game plays like 'Zombiess!!!' or 'Martians!!!' on steroids.  Very similar mechanisms with some more advanced options.

Definitely a winner.  Because of this game, I plan on picking up Last Night on Earth.

RATING: 10
I wasn't that excited initially, yes, a re-themed big-box LNoE expansion, the more the merrier, whatever.
To my pleasant surprise, it's way more than that. It brought new mechanics and possibilities to the already great system, while retained compatibility with the original. Outstanding, primarily thematic engine which still requires strategic play, more than ever.

Quite a hoot to play.  Lots of mayhem and swings of fate.  Wish the Martians were not so darn slow!  As a game, too random to really care about winning and losing but it makes for a good stroy.  Not sure about the legs, but for a few plays I think it would remain quite entertaining.  Funny miniatures.

While it has the same base mechanics as Last Night on Earth, the zany carny theme is an absolute hoot.  

Most importantly, out of the box, the Martians side offers many more options than that of the Zombies in LNoE.

A lot of fun - which, in the end, is all that matters.

You had me at Aliens! 
But Wow...I am blown away! These Aliens are tough...oh so tough! If you are a fan of LNOE or AToE, you cannot go wrong with this game. Like many I was a little worried about the Circus theme. I shouldn't have even given it a second thought...this game is a blast to play. When playing LNOE as the Zombie player, I always felt that it was a little bit boring, certainly not as fun as the heroes. Well...upon reading the rulebook and playing our first game, I learned the Martians are way more fun to play than I ever suspected. The Martians are divided exactly like LNOE, but they have a board of choices, there is more Martian players interaction, and Tech cards. Oh those Tech cards are magnificent! The Martians also have the ability to build a Zard beast and Super Commander! Those poor heroes won't know what hit them!

I believe Flying Frog has created a genre of board games that scratches that bad 'B' movie theme itch that some of us have had for years! I will never doubt them again! This game blasts away my mediocre expectations of a game and thrusts it forward to one outstanding game, with a box full of plastic and cardboard goodness! And to top it all off it can be combined with LNOE for one mega carnage inducing game of Hero, Zombie and Martian pitted against each other. Who would win?

The artwork, cardboard, and plastic components are all still the best of quality. The scenarios are so good. I must admit I'm ready for more future scenarios. Flying Frog and Jason Hill are always so good about providing fresh new scenarios periodically throughout the year.

RATING: 7
An updated theme using the Last Night On Earth system. Here you're playing more mano on mano though, with one player, or team, playing each side. The zombies aka the Martians are easier to get out and take more shots, but also easier to kill. The Martian players have nice decisions to make on how to spend their action points each turn - investing in stronger powers to use later on, or doing instant now things like getting more troops out, or moving spawn sites. Which makes this version more interesting than the original. But it's still little more than various scenarios of dice, move, whack, dice. A thematic ride which can be fun with the right people, but don't be expecting much more than that.

RATING: 9
While it does have the same mechanic of Last Night on Earth this game has a dramatically different feel to it. The Martians are much more strategic and the heroes are inherently stronger. 

Although this has turned the tables to a point. While zombies started stronger the Heroes would grow through searches and items,the heroes tend to stand still with their abilities and only a few cards ever being drawn.
 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The Martians are fun even if they do have the longevity of a Tie-Fighter in a blender. They are helped by their tech cards and regular reinforcements and won all five scenarios one way or another. The eight Carnie Heroes are outnumbered and though they can kill many Martians were always mobbed in the end. If the Martians kill four Heroes (or the Heroes all the Martians on the board) it is a sudden death victory and this gave the aliens three of their victories. It could do with some more heroes and scenarios, but as it is compatible with Last Night on Earth I don't think this will happen directly.

I actually liked parts of it more then Last Night on Earth but my playing group wasn't as enthusiastic so I had to give it away. In stead of zombies it features aliens who become more powerful in groups. There can only be 3 in one space and they also shoot lasers at a distance. There are evasion tests involved since every hero has a certain agility value. The aliens also come with a leader and the Zard Beast - huge powerful monster that kills everything in site, including aliens. Other featrures include moving spawning areas, fire which spreads and crowds of people. The heroes are carnival folk and I really like their minis. The aliens also have helmets. I like the alien theme, variety of minis, more options for the villain and the fact that aliens are more powerful in groups. Surprised an expansion hasn't come out yet, but I guess that with the immense popularity of LNOE this has remained in the shadows. It can drag a bit with the agility tests and fire tests. I miss it.

I painted all the heroes and most aliens.

It is hard to judge this from one play. It is definitely more complex and involved that LNOE, with an emphasis on ranged combat (death rays, ray guns, cannons etc.) which makes movement much more tactical. The theme is great, but maybe a bit too far out in order to evoke the same genre familiarity as LNOE, because the are rarely any alien movies around anymore, let alone alien movies set on a circus ground. Anyhow, the production value, balance and tongue in cheek humour is very good, like all Flying Frog games. This needs more plays with better knowledge of the rules to be fully appreciated. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Flying Frog brings their familiar quality of work and bits, as well as their style of game rules back to the table.  Fans of Last Night on Earth will find a similar board layout, and the Characters are played in a familiar way in a co-op against a player or duo controlling the evil invading Martian forces.  The characters have a token economy similar to - but simpler to activate than - the one that is found in A Touch of Evil. The trade off for this is that it may be harder to acquire activation tokens.  The carnival/circus theme of the invasion site adds a lot of humor to the game when compared to the other two games in the Flying Frog stable.  I prefer this to either of the other two games, but I would gladly play any of the three.

Another nice theme filled game from FFP.  I really like this one, even after a single play.  
The martian players now have more to do than just try to overwhelm the heros, building tech or calling in the big guns adds to the experience.  

The game seems balanced enough even though the hero characters seem a lot tougher.

This games real value comes from the inclusion of Invasion + Last Night rules.  You can now mix and match the two games for Martians vs. the small town or Zombies vs. Circus freaks.  Really, this is multiple games in a single box.

Tactical game in the same vein as [i][url=http://www.juegosdemesacr.com/cms/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=200&Itemid=1]Descent: Journeys in the Dark[/url][/i], in which one player plays as the master that control the invaders and the others as the heroes, a bunch of circus performers that are the Earth first line of defense against the aliens. Nothing new to add to the genre, although the components are gorgeous and the gameplay is all right. Again, an outstanding retro B-movie setting by Flying Frog Productions.

4.15.12 (1st play) Love it! It's been a while since I played LNoE but I think I like this better. Martian champions were a great idea. 

I ended up getting rid of this one for two reasons. I didn't like the fire mechanic and getting loot was a bit of a chore that didn't always pay off. I did have fun with it for a few plays though.

10/13/10 - Initial Rating, Need a few more plays. Initial reaction is very good though. I like how they took the mechanics from LNOE but changed it drastically to create extremely different tactical differences between the Martians and the Zombies. Heroes play virtually the same, but have a few new varieties. I see myself playing this game quite often since I've played LNOE to death.

Martians RULE!!!! Same system as LNoE but with a twist via the Martians. The way Martians plays completely changes the how the heroes play. These heroes are also more suped up than the LNoE heroes. The icing on the cake is that you can mix this with LNoE and have a wonderfully chaotic 8 player match of Heroes vs Martians vs Zombies.

Got this on the cheap at Essen 2013. Have Last Night on Earth which I like, but my friends aren't that thrilled on it. 

Perhaps if I combine that game with this one (mixing aliens and zombies) they will like the game. :)

If not, both will be traded/sold as an unplayed game is a useless game.

Shellie got for her birthday and showed us at Francie's.  Really themey and is singular in its design as a cooperative against one player, who plays the invading Martians. Lots of attacking, the cards work great and are kind of cool, the bits are outstanding. I like the old Circus theme, great place for Martians to attack Earth for the first time. I want to play this again! The Martian minis with space helmets are really NICE!

I wanted this to be every bit as good as Last Night on Earth, considering that the two share many of the same game mechanisms. It is good, but I think moving from shotguns to ray guns is a little more than the system is able to handle. In order to make a believable alien invasion, both the Heroes and the monsters required a pretty hefty power up. That alone wouldn't be such a big deal, but the side effect is a whole lot of extra die rolls. The heroes have to roll an extra die each turn to generate Power tokens and the aliens, with their powered up ranged weapons, force the heroes to make countless dodge rolls. In actuality it's probably not a huge addition of extra rolls over Last Night on Earth, but it certainly feels like it bogs the game down a little bit. It's still a worthy addition to the Flying Frogiverse, it just doesn't stand up to the original Zombie flavored game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Seriously underrated game. The 1930s Carnival theme is really fun and different. The strategy is really well-balanced between the heroes and martians, but plays completely differently from each other and from Last Night on Earth. IFOS plays like an absurdist action movie, in the best possible way.

I really like this game more that LNOE, but I guess you just can't beat zombies for mass appeal. But come on! How often do you get to play an 8ft tall dancing bear in a tutu?

My third fave from Flying Frog Productions.  This would be my second (currently that is held by Last Night on Earth) except for the fact that this one is aliens and LNOE is zombies.  I love the game mechanics of this game slightly better than those found in LNOE, but the theme is less.  If the game mechanics for this one were in LNOE, then it would be a near perfect game.  I know, I know...the two games are virtually identical, but the interactive play from the aliens is much more than just drawing a random card and rolling attack dice.  The zombies game is a bit too vague in gameplay, but overwhelming in flavor which makes this one my third choice from FFP...

This sat on my shelf for quite some time before I decided to give it a whirl.  I am happy I did!

The components are the same high-level of quality as we can expect from Flying Frog Productions.  I am extremely happy with this purchase!

The miniatures for the martians are perfect in that they even included clear "bubbles" for their helmets!  These guys thought of everything!

The gameplay, in my opinion, is even more exciting than LNoE.  The Martian player has more going on in each turn which is by far a better playing experience than playing the zombies in LNoE.  

The heroes are not only unique in theme, but also have special abilities contolled by tokens.  To me, this makes more sense.  

Honestly, I was a little skeptical, because I already owned and loved Last Night on Earth.  Many fellow geeks complained that this was a watered down version of the same game.  I couldn't disagree more.

Definitely give this a try!  I think you will enjoy it more than LNoE.

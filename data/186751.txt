I don t understant the craze for this game.
I play tree games, and i always have the same feeling. Of course, you have somme fantastic drawing, the figure are amazing and you can play mythologic good.
But the game a last is not really interressting. 
- is best for two player. 
- it s way to long to install the game, draft and choose your caractere (went you have the god pledge) almost 45 min. ans after you need to put away
- the rules need to be more streamline
- to me, you have some rules for power or spéciale attaque illogicality. 
- you don t have a mutiple stategie to win the game.  If you re the strongest you win...
- some zone on the board are to big for my tast and give a really advantage if you contrôle the middle of the board

I've never much engaged with skirmish games, but this is simply excellent. I love how the mechanisms interlock and I have begun to appreciate the tactical depth of MB:P. 
Currently, I enjoy this so much that I am not even angry I did not get most of the expansion boxes - I feel even with my base pledge+ I will be having fun with this for a very, very long time.

The intro game between 2 players only took 40min to play - twice.  A full game between 3 players took 3 hours. With another 40 min to explain all the rules. I could see a 2nd game taking perhaps 2 - 2 1/2 hrs with 3 players.  A 2 player skirmish game should play quite quickly.  Lots of variation with scenarios with game.

Excellent developer commitment and communication. The game miniatures look great and the theme is good. Mechanically, it is very simple to explain. May take up to 15 minutes to explain the skirmish rules. Setup and drafting may take 30 minutes the first time since there are many cards to read. But no way this game is 3.0+ complex, it is definitely 2 at most, since the rules are very simple, and t has the easy to learn hard to master vibe.

Why is this game good?
-Aesthetically, it looks good. The theme is well woven into the game.
-The rules and components are well made, and it has been tested a lot.
-Replay value is high since the drafting itself leads to different games, and if you get bored of picking the same stuff, either ban it or get more expansions. The replay value is also increased because it is not only a 1v1 skirmish game, it also includes scenarios for more people, coop scenarios and even an RPG with an additional rulebook purchase.
-Phases: There is a draft phase and a battle phase. In the draft phase, you choose a god or a titan, and normally 12 recruitment points to make your army. Then, you go to the battle phase in which players take turns to draw cards (with a deck made of cards that come with each specific miniature) and play them to summon the miniatures, activate them, attack or collect Omphalos (a victory condition). To win, you have your god absorb four omphalos or destroy the opposing god.
-Strategy: The draft is public, so you can see what your opponent picks. Each named unit can only be picked one, so you can deny your opponent of possible combos or get units that are good against them. In the battle itself, there are many options: What to do with your cards, which units to activate, which abilities to use, and which victory path will you take. Also, in when units attack, they use a special dice system.
-Dice: The dice (d6) is numbered 1-5 with a blank face. The blank face is an auto miss or used to throw opposing units if you have such an ability. The other numbers can be grouped however you like to overcome the defender's defenses. You can take each dice at face value or remove them to increase +1 to any other result. Also, each dice with a number 5 is rerolled to add the new result to 5. So, basically your rolls go from 0-4 and from 5-9 or more. I don't know what happens if you reroll a 5.
-Units: Each unit you draft provides cards to your deck, and they have a recruitment cost if they are not gods or titans. They always give you unit-specific activation cards and some of them are 'smart' and give you ''Art of War'' cards that are used to activate any unit, draw cards, search for specific cards or activate special powers. Each unit has between 0 and 3 keywords that denote special but basic abilities such protecting other units or throwing trees. Then, there is a matrix of stats (attack, defense, range, movement, health, available abilities), of which one line denotes the current health level, and is reduced as it takes damage. This typically makes the unit weaker or unable to use special powers. Lastly, units have between 0 and 3 special powers, such as regenerating at the end of the unit's activation, doing area attacks, buffing/debuffing, and even increasing the available units in an army with free units or more recruitment points. The better the abilities, the weaker the stats for the particular cost tend to be.
-Play time: Expert players can get a game done in ~40 minutes, while explaining it for the first time and reading cards may take from 1:30 to 2 hours.

Even though the box and name aren't very appealing, once you get past it, you discover a very good game that is easy to teach, challenging and can provide a lot of hours of entertainment. The drafting aspect isn't typical to miniature wargames, and presents some challenges if implemented competitively, which is why it doesn't get a full score. Outside of the competitive scene, the game is very good, which is why, along with the points mentioned above, get a very good score of 9/10.

Veredict:
-Get this game if you want a Greek mythology themed game.
-Get this game if you want a self contained miniature skirmish game.
-Get this game if you don't like luck determining victory like in other games.
-Wait if all you do is want to play competitively, until tournaments are actually running and hearing the pros and cons after the fact.

Excellent game and production (apart of some not so good minis).

Gameplay:
The unit activasion system alongside with the tons of different abilities of the units, make up for a great experience which allows many strategy paths to follow and tactical decisions to be made. The dice rolling system implemented, brings some push your luck elements, where, you can go for safe plays or all in if you feel like it and depending on the dice rolled.

Component quality:
Most of the minis are beautiful and i like the card quality. There are some bad minis though, which are seem to be made from different plastic material. Thats only minor though, overall rating is very high here as well.

The bad:
It takes so much time to setup the game and put back everything in their boxes. The game desperatelly needs some kind of insert.

I like this game.  The only reason I rated it as low as I did it the sheer bulk of the game makes it difficult to get to the table.  Don't get me wrong, the variety that causes that bulk (especially when KS extras or expansions are include) enhances the game -- but it's still difficult to lug to game night.

Other than that, great game!

How did this game get past me? Even in its earlier cardboard edition? This is a snappy, fast, and fun game of battling gods and monsters, men and magic, heroes and villains. The miniatures are phenomenal, the rules easy to learn, the mechanics novel, and the entire package stunningly thematic. It's every Greek swords-and-sandals and Ray Harryhausen epic brought to life. A fantastic movie-skirmish game! I'm in speechless awe of anyone who has a complete set of Pantheon and all the expansions!

Received my God's EB + Typhon add on pledge. The sheer amount of stuff is crazy. I am very, very happy with what I received ...well ... except for those hideous cardboard rocks that is ;)
Played the tutorial scenario a couple of times and seemed that Ares had an unfair advantage as his troops are closer to the Omphalos. I thought that there must be something that I was missing ... namely, once a unit claim an Omphalos how can the unit lose it (besides being killed)... I did not find an answer in the Gettting started booklet ... but hear something in one of the Beasts of War videos. That is, when Hydra throws a unit it will drop the Omphalos.  Will investigate more ... anyways I want to play again!
Ok, in the rush to play I missed the section on special powers ... (in particular Mighty Throw) .  After I added the powers to my game play the game is just wow. Crazy good! Played the gane three more times. 2 against my alter ego and one against my lad.

20171212: Resistance at Thermopylae
這個 scenario 是用已定 人物, 只有一神一英雄和七小隊, 沒有拿gem, 玩特別地型。一玩家用 deck, 另一玩家每回合控兩小隊, 要善用 talent 和 complete 隊型得有效陣式。一個好的學習起始 scenario.
20171223 Rescue The Princess!
Mythic Battles...昨晚開四人的情景模式，三人分別控Hades, Zeus 和Athena 尋找及拯救公主大戰 Cerberus, Hydra, Medusa 和 Minotaur怪獸。遊戲中控神的三人都各懷鬼胎各自要爭取拯救公主不讓他人(神) 可獨自領功，控怪的亦可在非常時期剎死公主。遊戲中三神互相牽制但亦要對付怪獸。最後 Medusa 看守公主利用地形優勢令三神互相爭功而敗了。這四人情景模式妙絕及精彩，令我更肯定Mythic Battles 是我的 2017 十大。
補充:  遊戲的補牌機制沒問題，可以用來平衡有玩家利用手上大量 AoW 發動超級 Combo, 補牌機制好讓遊戲回歸起始的平衡，反而我們玩時大家協議不用 Recall 功能來避免一些太不合理的時空部隊轉移。

This game looks beautiful, with nice board components and superb minis. The actual gameplay is surprisingly good, with a nice central mechanic. Each unit has its own special ability, and these inevitably clash against each other sometimes, so game balance isn't perfect. It's really a two-player game with multi-player support bolted on, so 3- or 4-player games really don't work as well.

Still exploring different playmodes - so far the basic scirmish with the army draft in the beginning offeres already very exciting games - each one rather different from the other - from a very tactical, almost peaceful struggle for the omphalos to crazy onslaughts in the middle of the battlefield. I am not a wargamer - and I am not a minis gamer ... but this minis awakend the desire to go full on geek and paint them ... the scenery on the battlefield with the huge variety of scales for the different figures gives this game an incredible epic feel!

I was hoping beyond hope this was going to have the actual game play to go along with the awesome theme and amazing miniatures.  It has exceeded expectations!

We have found there are lots of layers to this game. It is not just run out and bash the other guy...although it is tempting to try and do so.  A chess analogy fits well. Gods are a mix between queens & kings (queen-like power, but the importance of the king)... Monsters are rooks...heroes are bishops/knights....troops are pawns.  

The dual goal of defeating the opponents' forces but also gathering omphalos keeps you flexible and games interesting. The boards are big enough to allow a little bit of strategic drawn up, but tight enough you can't turtle, run, or hide for too long.

Card management has a lot of CCG-inspired nuance that I don't think we have even begun to understand fully.  The dice mechanic is fresh and engaging with just enough push-your-luck.  Turns are snappy with little down time.

Believe the hype!

Mythic Battles: Pantheon is a skirmish game with miniatures, army drafting, dice combat, and hand management.  This game can be played 1v1, 2v2, or 3 or 4 player FFA.  In addition, the base game, compendium, and many of the expansions (Hera, Poseidon, Hephaestus, Titans, Manticore) come with campaigns that can be played cooperatively.  

Players take turns drafting a divinity (god or titan) and then the rest of their army using their Recruitment Points.  Once this is done, the players take to the game board and battle it out.  Victory is achieved by being the last divinity standing, or the first divinity to absorb a preset amount of power crystals (Omphalos). 

The action of the game can start off a little slow as units do not start on the board and must be deployed first.  Units can only be activated/deployed if their owner is able to play its activation card.  The maps themselves are just large enough to allow maneuvering and positioning, but not so big that the action is delayed.  

The combat is done with an innovative "exploding dice" system.  The 2 phases of dice combat takes a couple of times to get used to, but once you do, it becomes second nature.  It provides players with a bit of choice to either take fewer but guaranteed hits, or to push your luck for the possibility of more hits. 

The usage of Art of War cards, which can either fuel special attacks/powers or be used to activate an extra unit or draw extra cards, provides another layer of decision making in hand management. 

With so many diverse units, which have unique combinations of Powers and Talents, the drafting and counter-drafting is a very enjoyable part of the game.  Don't be surprised to find yourself theory-crafting with different unit combinations when not playing the game.  In addition to the units, the different maps and varying terrain and starting positions also provide a lot of replayability.    

The quality and detail level of the miniatures are amazing.  The cards are just ok so I would recommend sleeving them (something I don't usually do) since they are constantly shuffled.  

This is a game that I enjoy a lot.  Not only is it beautifully made, it provides a great combination of both strategic (army drafting and counter drafting) and tactical (hand management and maneuvering) depth for a skirmish game.  You don't need to be a fan of Greek mythology to enjoy this one.  

Although this game will most likely not be available in retail, those interested will have another shot at it with an upcoming Kickstarter reprint.  Highly recommended!

I've played the introduction game twice with my 11 years old son. The introduction game was a great way to learn the game and we are eager to play more. My son said that MB is like Battlelore (play a card to activate a unit) and Heroclicks (stronger units get weaker when they are injured) , two games he loves. This was one reason I kickstarted MB and I am not disappointed. The game felt like to tell a story. The best rule compenent is the use of the Art of War cards. The Art of War cards let you do a lot of different moves but due to the number of cards regulate how much you can do. Great! I am excited to see, if the whole game gets better.

Modifying the dice is the hardest part to grasp. 

In the beginning skirmish, if you are first player, odds are you're going to win. Seemed a little off balance because of that. But that's the beginner skirmish. We think once we try some of the deeper scenarios a lot more complexity will be added in, and it will feel more balanced.

Definitely willing to try again. Plus Greek gods. Love greek mythology.

Re-read the dice rules a couple of times. It will definitely help.

Much better than its forebear, and not just in terms of visual appeal (though that is hard to dismiss, its juvenile portrayal of most of the women notwithstanding)--the activation system is tight, the two different victory conditions are excellent, and the unit variety is stunning. I don't know if I'd like this as much with just the base box, but with the huge pool and the build-in drafting system this is easy to recommend.

I had a chance to play this at GenCon, and had a blast. I also brought some other friends who aren't too into board games, and they all also enjoyed it. A couple even decided they would pledge when the KS goes live.
It was very easy to learn, to the point that when I came back with a second group of friends on the last day of the con, I was able to teach them most of what they needed to know to play.
The artwork and miniatures are great. I love the theme, and the possibility to expand to other mythologies.

Played it at a show. I originally did not want to play it. I originally did not think I'd be the slightest interested by this game. I thought it was a MOBA. I was told it's not and that I should really try it. 
I tried it and forgot all the other games I wanted to see at the show. I spent my day playing that game. How could I describe it? Take chess (I don't like chess, but still), make the teams asymmetrical, give them hit points. Add the fact that to move a piece, you need to draw the card corresponding to that piece in a deck (with various ways to go around that), various types of attack, of special skills, and an extremely good combat system, using dice but with a very interesting way to decrease significantly the effect of luck. Add awesome miniatures, a really cool theme, and you got mythic battles: pantheon.
There's a good learning skill, plenty of combo capabilities, yet it's possible to have fun quickly. Seriously, I was really impressed by this game.

This game is Awesome ! 
We have 3 games mode : skirmish, scenario and campaign, the sculps are just amazing !

You are able to play a god with board separated by zones allowing you to moove easily without complicated rules of movement. The dice mecanism reduce the random result because you may explose a 5 and also use a failure with special powers of some creatures.

Just look more how a game works and have a close look on the current kickstarter campaign, you won't regret it if ancient greece theme thrills you

This game is amazing, I love just about everything about it, the gameplay, the strategy, the drafting, the dice mechanic is ingenious, it feels so thematic and cinematic, don't even get me started on the models and artwork.
The only negatives I can find are; the price is high but you get a tonne of content for your money, and the clips don't work great in all of the dashboards but they have already said they are looking into a solution for this. 
When this came out at my club it caused such a buzz. Seemed weird taking part in a game surrounded by so many spectators. Think this is the 1st time I've ever given a game a 10/10.

This game is definitely better than the Mythic Battles game it re-implements due to the inclusion of awesome miniatures, but I don't think there is enough strategy to carry it to the level of a highly rated strategy game. It is fun and drafting during setup is a great idea that is underutilized (compared to synergistic "lists" in similar games).

But... the reason those lists exist is because of the deeper strategy present in those games that allows for better synergy and planning. I think the weight here is vastly overstated, but I suppose I've only played the skirmish mode.

While the actual game has not arrived yet, I have played the PnP many times and this game is fantastic! I cannot wait for my Typhon Pledge to get here! Only weeks to wait now!

The miniatures are magnificent. The rules are not simple but easy enough to learn once you have played it a couple of times. It only takes about an hour once people are familiar with the rules. The mechanics are very unique and the use of card activated miniatures is very different from most other miniatures games. The exploding 5's and way you can manipulate your rolls by using them to bump up your results makes every unit useful despite who they are up against. The movement and combat rules are very streamlined which makes it easier to learn. And finally, the drafting of forces is genius! With all of the choices of possible combinations, you will never play the same game twice!

Saw the kickstarter and i was intrigued by the cool miniatures and the Greek mythology theme and although i am a miniature painter (and my son too) i denied this product to my self (and my wallet) because i just dont see any gaming future for this, of course the (possible) purchases of the needed expansions just added to that fact.
Overall its the same case as the [thing=160010][/thing] kickstarter project, awesome miniatures but the gameplay future of both of them was the X factor for [-]buying[/-] rejecting them.

[size=12][b]Why I like Mythic Battles: Pantheon:[/b][/size]
+ The theme of this game appeals to me.  
+ The art for the game is good.
+ The miniature models are probably the best that I've seen in a board game.  The aspect ratio might nonetheless be off if you plan to use them in another game. 
+ The availability of the game is apparently being approved with a planned reprint. 

[size=12][b]Why I dislike Mythic Battles: Pantheon:[/b][/size]
- I am not a wargamer.
- I dislike games that require a card to activate certain units.
- The dice reallocation system is a bit odd. 
- Some of the characters seem significantly better than others. I think that less is more in this case.

[b]10: Outstanding game. One of my all-time personal favorites.[/b]
This game, is great from the bottom to the top and all in between. Deep strategy, quick playing, fairly simple to grasp, huge variety of forces/combinations (I went Typhon). Beautiful art, minis, and a huge amount of campaigns (Both solo/co-op and VS), in addition to head to head skirmish pretty much guarantees this game will never leave my collection. 

It is a wonderful sandbox fighting game of 40 ft Gods and Goddesses, larger than life heroes, fantastic beasts, and historical/mythological troops.

Even with only the core box you have a decent amount of combinations for your army.
The game makes you think a lot of what movements you want to plan. Anticipate what your opponent will do. What card, activation, art of war, …you want to save.
At 2p skirmish it is taunting to grab a lot of units, but with some plays I think of not having a too big deck is more useful.
Even after the game you think what would have been better decisions and how to approach next time.
Way better than I had thought from watching the videos during the KS.

Only criticism: Scenario book has some printing issues. Sentences are not complete (hydra hunt, at low boil,…) and some rules are not specific this way.
Rule book is written well. But some rules are only thorough with reading the game terms in advance (like cards use of destroyed units) 
The player aid is really great.

I got this KS primarily for the miniatures!  Nice collection for $99 delivered, and right in one of my favorite genres.  Really excellent miniatures, I don't understand the complaints I've read about here.  And then later, I found it's also a highly rated battle game, so I played, and I happen love that too.  Double win!  Yes I like the exploding dice mechanic, and the card/deck/hand management play.  It's really a fierce card duel game at heart.  Very few different cards and the miniatures act as heath targets and damage launch points.  If you don't have the right cards at the right time, your units will just stare at the enemy as they run around - very very different from any other miniatures game out there.  Think Xena Warrior Princess, slightly comedic.  The characters must be yelling boasts and insults at each other if their cards are not handy.  :P

Now I'm actively searching for more players in the South San Francisco Bay Area.  Great fun to be had!

Not just a box full of expensive mini's, but it looks to be a very good game. Easy to pick up, loads of options, tons of different units all different from each other. Cool drafting mechanism, exploding dice that you can manipulate, even blanks give you options with some gods/monsters/heroes. The mini's look amazing and for $99 you get a ton of game. I'm all in myself with the Typhon pledge. First KS I back!

I work on the project, as a freelance and I generally choose on what kind of project I work on.

And this one is really fun. It's not just about the fight, it's about to be in the battlefield with gods and monsters, it's about telling a story. Not like a role playing game or in games like descent. No it's just pure amusement : the minis are really great and using Zeus or Achilles or all the names of the mythology, it's such a cool experience.

And, I have to mention the fact that the game mechanism (deck, explosion+bonus dices, draft) are well balanced and integrated. To my opinion, it's such a modern game. Not maybe the most revolutionary, but certainly one the most in the spirit of the times. And the minis, the maps... are so good looking !

Also, I want to mention the scenario/campaign mode. The game works without it, but it gives more replayability .

Last, as I'm in charge of it, I want to mention the organised play. We have made three tournament so far, and begun a league. FFG have told us they're pretty sure they will do OP, the game is perfect for that. It's another clue to prove that this gale will have a long life after the KS and the delivery.

cheers !

Awesome game! Miniatures are beautiful and numerous with the KS typhon bundle! You have many hours in front of you. The replayability is huge, if not infinite. You will not have the same game even if you play with the same scenario and the same units. Everything is a question of strategy and tactic. You always have to adapt to your opponent. I was afraid it was too cold and too thoughtful but you really are immersed in the greek mythology. Every unit have it's flavour. Battles are very fun. You have to be careful what card and when to play it. I highly recommend this game to all player who want an interesting skirmish game.

kickstarter - Typhon bundle

Probably the best game in my collection! And the best kickstarter campaign (and after campaign till Delivery) I experienced.

I like:
- Mythic background
- Very cinematic game: rythm between rounds and player's turn is fast, 
- Draft and recruitment  are very strategic and dynamic: you assemlble your army in function of the opponent's choices
- A lot of tactical options to go for the Victory
- Combat is resolved by dice but the mecanic  behind makes you never feel you loose or win only because of bad dice
- The core game units are well balanced (still to check for the add-ons)
- A lot of ways to enjoy the game: solo, 1-1; 3, 4, 2-2 and campaigns mode (with artefacts...)
- miniatures and art are beautifull and very good quality

Really amazing game. It would be a great skirmish game, with hundreds of matches,  But it's thanks to the scenarios when you can really appreciate how flexible the system is... Almost 80 with all the expansions, with campaigns and great variety, including cooperative scenarios (yeah, not only a 1 vs 1 skirmish game).

It's deep but not unnecessary complicated. It's fun. The only bad thing I can find in it is some lambdas in not Spartan minis and maybe, if you have every expansion, so many options for units that it's intimidating.

Oh, and the minis and the production is top notch: great component quality, great minis.

Tested the game multiple times at conventions, always had a blast!
Great mix of Skirmish with minis, card game and dice throwing.
All that with the possibility to mitigate randomness (explosive dice, art of war cards).

If feels cinematic, is dynamic and looks great. I could play this for ages.

The skirmish is kinda fun should be played with either 2 or 4 players.  The ending drags on a bit.  The co-op scenario we played had very poor instructions lots of ambiguity.

Over all OK game but there are a lot of ambiguity in the rules.

Minis look excellent and the gameplay is elegant but with nice depth of play. A skirmish game that accomodates varying player numbers 2-4 and a campaign and co-op mode that is based on Greek mythology is perfect for me.
Having now received everything from the kickstarter I can say that the minis are easily the highest quality and most detailed single part minis that I have had the pleasure of painting. The new compounds that they are using means no more bent swords and spears either which makes the minis looks so much better.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The VERY wonky combat system needs some getting used to.  The Initiative talent is perhaps too powerful, especially in Achilles. That Ares/Achilles combo is very overpowered
 in the introductory scenario. I suspect there will be some revisions of rules and power/talent revisions as this undertested game system hits the real world.

EDIT: Still missed some fiddly rules after the 15th play.
The scenarios I’ve played in the Hephaistos and especially the Rise of the Titans are not well balanced, in general. 

Played through the Hephaistos campaign and believe the finale is an easy win for Red (comments on that page.) 

Played through the 5 Rise of the Titans campaign. Problems: conflict in Forcrs for scenario 1 setup list and map; big problem with rule for gods and titans entering the rifts: takes 2 mvt. Points to enter and they cannot end their move there. Suicide city crossing. Biggest problem: the first 4 scenarios are ridiculously easy to win. Did anyone play test this?!?

In spite of all that, this is already my #21 favorite game, due to minis and concept. It shines best in skirmish battles. Scenarios are hit or miss.

Wow!

Quality pieces!  ARTWORK!  scenario!  Versatility!
Minis are fucking amazing!  The sculpting is sublime!  Some of the swords and spears are a little flimsier than I would like, though.  

The clips, the hero/god boards, and the playing cards are high quality stuff.  The artwork and quality is amazing!

Scenarios are fun!  You can even picking different gods, troops, and heroes on each board with a point buy system that would have been great for Conan.  You can still do that for Conan, but you can easily wind up with unbalanced sides.  And you probably still can in this game, but the point buy system helps reduce that chance and makes it easier!  

The Compendium!  OMG!  Get this if you do not have it!  It has more scenarios. a campaign actually, like 20 scenarios long.  And then at the end it has VERY detailed steps and photos of how to paint most of the minis.  And how to make and paint custom 3d terrain.  It is fucking PHENOMINAL!

Kickstarter. Titan-bundle (loads of expansions). Probably got a bit carried away and bought a few more expansions than I really need. Oh, well, I got a LOT of cool stuff. Components are really great. The rules are (probably) quite simple. But they are a mess. Full of inconsistencies. You have to go back to the French rules to find answers, and sometimes that only confuses even more. Setup is slow. Play is quicker. I've only tried it solo so far. It's supposed to be for 1-4 players. But solo/co-op is crap. It's probably best to run skirmish all the time, with two players (or perhaps four). I will try that as soon as I can find people willing to play with me. That will probably raise my rating a bit (6 or 7 is likely, but probably not higher). Right now the game is a little bit of a dissapointment though. Hyped.

I thought it as a sort of deck building skirmish game with great minis, it looked very promising.
A bit disappointed after ~10 PnP sessions though. Because of the random draws and low numbers of possible AoW cards in your deck (that can increase activations) the game seems to lack dynamic. The end-game can be exiting though, and pulling off some great combos is really where the game shines.
The realy bad/ugly part of the game is coordinating Troops units, which really is a mess. I don't see why they are so interwoven in the game and 60% of all Gods/Heroes have Troops related talents. 
Rules need some more streamlining and clarification. 

Not convinced yet this game will prove to be that good. 7.1/10

Only played the introductory scenario a couple of times so far, but the first impressions are good.

Very interesting game. It's a straightforward skirmish game, like Summoner wars or Shadespire but unlike those games, you can win this game by clever tactical play, avoiding combat and focusing on collecting and absorbing gems on the board. 

The combat dice re-allocation system works well and adds an enjoyable element of "push your luck" to the combat. The hand management aspect is slightly frustrating but special "art of war" cards can be spent to pick specific cards out from the deck and otherwise manage some of the chaos. The hand management aspect is definitely not as good as Shadespire, but the movement and multiple victory conditions make the game faster paced and more exciting. Not sure if the game might be more fun with the hand management part removed. Otherwise it seems a decent enough game. I'm looking forward to playing more and perhaps it will turn out to be more fun than Conan and Shadespire.

Some typos and misprints on the game pieces themselves (ie. Unit dashboards and activation cards, not just in the manual) when there were feasible ways to prevent it prior to release, shaves off a point from an otherwise beautifully made game.

Troops, though not useless, could also use a little more love.

I tested, for the second time, Myhtic Battles on a 3D demo table during a convention.

Since that, i want to buy the game and the table.

I mean, litteraly. I back the game on KS.. and I contact the guy who made the 3D board (he agreed to make me a perso 3D board)..

Normally it must reveal how I was impressed by the game I did.
It was awesome. I haven't play a so good game since a lot of years.
. 
So, great minis and wonderful gameplay deserve the best board possible.
For the same reason, I really consider to paint the minis, something I never wanted to do before (Mansion of Madness, Gears of War, Zombicide, Descent V1 etc... ).

I realize, as I am wrting, that I actually consider MB:P like my future best game among the 60 boardgames I have.

What a great game!  Three rounds in, loving it and learning some of the subtleties of hand-management or how to get the most out of the various talents, or the units.  Looks beautiful on the table.

Yet, sadly, another game not earning the top score it deserves through the needlessly male adolescent, blatantly sexist art.  It's embarrassing, the female figures in painted-on armor in ridiculous poses.  Enough, in any case, for me to give Ragnarok a pass, unless the art team grows up a little.

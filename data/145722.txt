Game has a ton more meat than is visible from just looking at it.  Love the decisions it offers along with the super short play time.  Love the theme & the artwork.  Very glad to have this in my collection, and one I can play with just about anyone.

This game is differently dependent on who you play it with but it is a fun and simple try and out guess your opponents type game and plays quickly enough that the high luck factor doesn't detract from it.  Played with four and worked nicely.

super light social deduction game.  I play with my little ones and it probably ranks higher with them.  For playing with adult players - i have better games with more meat in them for this style of mechanic.  

components are fantastic and thick chipboard, art is beautiful and even the box is funny on the shelf (spot UV coat and eyeball peeking thru the key hole)

Prenez les 3 petits cochons, le petit chaperon rouge et la mère-grand. Ils ont tous les 5 un point commun. allez, un effort... "Mais qu'est-ce que vous avez de grandes dents" "C'est pour mieux te manger, mon enfant". Dans ce jeu, nous avons donc : un loup, et de la nourriture. Le loup va essayer de manger un personnage pendant son sommeil, en espérant ne pas mettre la patte dans un piège. Il réussi, il marque des points, sinon il en perd. Tous les persos qui dorment marquent des points si ils ne se sont pas fait bouffer. Il faudra donc soit être prudent et poser un piège, soit avoir confiance en sa bonne étoile pour que le loup ne vienne pas. Le personnage du loup change à chaque manche. Un jeu court idéal pour les familles

Succinct in the experience of bluffing. Despite the dissimilar themes, this game has a lot in common with Sheriff of Nottingham, but much quicker and lighter. A filler version of the same bluffing mechanic.

Thick cardboard stock and great art.

[b][FirstPlayOn18thApril2014][/b] This game turned out to be a real surprise for me. I had the game and was waiting for the right time to pull it out. I read the rulebook and find that it was okay. As soon as we tried the game, man, it was surprisingly good. The game sets in the werewolf universe.

I really like the bluffing mechanic in the game and the push-your-luck element whether you'll get caught by the wolf player or not. The decision making in this game is pretty simple but what makes it very fun was the choice whether to gamble or not. If you choose to set a trap (this is done hidden, with a face down card), then you want the wolf player to choose you, so that you get points. If you choose to sleep, then you're hoping that the wolf player doesn't pick you so you could score points. That's it, only two choices for the non-wolf player and that simple yet agonizing decision is what makes the game so fun.

Very interesting for a such a simple game. The game has minimal components (can be treated as a micro-game) and it's just cool to see how well everything works together.

A pure guessing/bluffing game with very high random factor. Definitely not something I'll play again but I can see where others would enjoy it a lot as the rules are very elegant. My guess is that if you enjoy Maffia/Werewolf then you'll like this one (it's a bit like Maffia light, but without the communication).

It's less structured than Love Letter and has less things to guess (and a lot less rules) so it might be a decent children's/gateway game.

A reasonably fun bluffing/guessing game. It's probably a little too simple to be particularly strategic but just a little too complex to fully benefit from the simple fun of the premise. It's still entertaining, though. I suspect it's probably also more entertaining with higher player counts.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (August 2017)

I don’t remember why I bought this game and it was utterly unknown to me before I played it. I don’t like the cover art so my desire to play it was very low. Still, the game really surprised me and I enjoyed it a lot.

The rules of the game are ultra-simple. You can teach them under 1 minute. Playtime is around 15 minutes.

The art and components are good. The theme is also fun.

Eat Me If You Can! is a very simple bluffing game, but it is fun. The whole game is about outthink your opponents and I really like this kind of game.

The game decisions needed to play the game are very simple and many times, obvious, still I enjoyed it a lot and had a lot of fun playing it. In each round a wolf is selected at random and then he tries to eat one of the other players. The players need to secretly select if they will stay awake awaiting the wolf or if they will sleep the night. If they choose correctly they gain VPs.  It is very simple, but with the right crowd, it is a blast. 

Best with 6 players.

Bottom line, Eat Me If You Can! really surprised me, it is a good party/family game. I think small children can play it unaided. I wasn’t expecting anything good from it, but it is a blast with the correct game group. I will sell it because a friend wants it and I´m trying to get my game collection under control.

以幾個大家耳熟能詳的童話故事角色，創造出這個規則簡單的吹牛遊戲~
可以說是簡易版的漢汀諾警長，玩家隨機扮演小紅帽、七隻小羊、三隻小豬以及主角大野狼，由大野狼玩家選擇襲擊哪個角色，如果襲擊成功(角色睡死了)，大野狼從角色那裏得分~
如果襲擊失敗(角色不睡覺設下陷阱)，該角色從大野狼那裏得分~
這遊戲2012年由日本設計師佐藤純一所設計，當初以卡牌遊戲發行，去年發行有轉盤的立牌小屋子，以及可愛的美術，更是吸引小孩子愛不釋手，只是小小年紀學習爾虞我詐，不知適不適合?~

This is very similar to Nicht zu fassen, and each one have their own faults which prevent them from being truly great games.

In this one, the big problem is that certain houses are better than others - it's not fair that one player can earn 3, while another only 1. My kids are young enough where I don't think it's a big deal for them. They really enjoy it, and it's definitely a big plus that even very young children can play this unassisted.

Another one of these 'how much game can we get out of few components' the Japanese seem to excel at lately.

This is quite light 'I'll think he'll think that I'll think' stuff. Which can be fun with the right players, but it's more about the metagame than the actual game itself.

Fast, simple japanese filler.
There is some tension in the decision: will you strike for the big points (Red Hood, 3 p) or the low piggy (1P)?
And the piggy, will he try to score thinking that he'll be safe or...
And so on!

Cute for everyone, does its job very well: for a while.

Each player chooses to go sleeping or stay awake creating a trap for the wolf. The wolf then chooses who he tries eating.

A great family bluffing / double-guessing game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Played one 5P game. A very simple game of bluff, yet there is a fair amount of decision-making involved. There are three decisions made every round – the loser of the previous round assigning the different identities to players, the non-Wolf players deciding whether to sleep or lay a trap, and the Wolf picking which player is most likely to be asleep. 

The ability of the previous loser to assign identities works surprisingly well as a comeback mechanism. The loser might assign himself as the Wolf and give a low-valued identity to the player with the most points, with the hope that the player would gamble on sleeping for that round. Alternatively, the loser could assign the Wolf identity to someone else and take advantage of the Wolf not knowing the value of other players. 

Don't be fooled by the cutesy theme or pleasantly quick playing time; there is a lot of double-thought involved in this game.

RATING: 5
This is a cute little game that masquerades as a deduction and bluffing game.  For those with a great poker face and a fondness for reading opponents, this game boils down to bluffing to its core... I'm either setting a trap for you or I'm not.  In the end, it's more or less still just a guessing game.

tl;dr: crapshoot, the game

Pigs select if they want to sleep or lay a trap. They get points if the wolf comes to them and they laid a trap or if the wolf doesn't come and they sleep. They lose points if they sleep and the wolf comes to eat them. The wolf scores points if he enters a home with a sleeping pig, he loses points if he enters a home with a trap. So it's crapshoot the game. Luckily it's short but it doesn't have a high replay value.

I really love the looks and artwork of this game, but can only really enjoy it when playing it with the children. And even then, it should not be player more than two times in succession. For adults, there just isn't enough game here, not even for a gateway filler game (and I generally do like simple family games).

I like games where you're trying to out-think your opponents in a blind selection, so I like the way this one plays out.  The benefits for choosing one card over another at the risk of giving the wolf player too many points is interesting, and the point values of each non-wolf role card drive the decision-making process.  It's cute, plays quickly, and is engaging.

I love the Japanese 2nd edition of this game, as published by Junias, Kunpu. The small packaging is wonderful, and this game is plain fun as heck! This will be an oft used filler, and popular party game in my circles. In my experience this works equally well with gamers, and casual players. I've even managed to get ludiophobes (people scared of games, my mother in this case) to play it. It's pretty much all about reading people.

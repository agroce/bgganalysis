After a single solo play, I think that this may the Knives Chao of deckbuilders: I want to like this more than I actually do and may need to break up with it.

It's a deckbuilder, and double sided cards aside, doesn't bring anything significantly new to the table. you buy stuff with three different resources, and you fight stuff with the opposite side of the cards. There's a bit of strategy in what cards you buy in order to stack resources and make sure you have the right symbols to active your combos for fighting, but ultimately this feels like a less interesting ascension. You go through your deck a little faster because you can draw twice per turn with the fighting, which is nice, but it can still drag a bit. The art is great, but that's to be expected with the source material.

I'll post a more in-depth review after a few more playthroughs, but I can already tell this will be one of my favorite games. 

It's a deckbuilder with a handful of new mechanics. If you don't like the Scott Pilgrim comics or movie, this game will probably be a pretty mediocre one. But, if you love the theme, this game sings. The art and graphic design are spot-on for what you'd expect out of a Scott Pilgrim game.

The double-sided cards are a little strange to get used to, but they make sense once you understand the rules.

The box insert just has one big open spot for the cards and a smaller indent for the slightly oversized (and gorgeous) character cards. It looks like it's designed with sleeving the cards in mind, which I plan to do.

Update: I sleeved the cards, and they fit in the box perfectly.

Quite complex deck building with many currencies. And double-sided with combat cards in the back! Wow. Tough. Extra tough. But fun altogether. Not sure about the cooperative rules nor solo and I've only played competitive.

Worst deck builder ever. Chaotic, random and nothing but luck of the draw. Plus... FOUR currencies? Come on now, even three is pushing it but you really needed to add fighting among the other three? Sigh and my brother is a HUGE fan of Scott Pilgrim and he HATED it so it's not just my ambivalence towards the theme. It's different but in the worst possible ways.

SO cool to feel like I'm in the comic! Great thematic deckbuilder that lost it's luster once I stopped being excited by that theme. Especially when combined with some silly complexity and fiddliness with the flipping of cards and such. So happy to have played it!

Interesting concepts. but too fiddly for my taste. The idea is nice, but I just doesn't feel very exciting. Maybe for uber fans of the comics, but not for me. So many better/more exciting deck-building games available.

Plays best with Scott Pilgrim fans - though I enjoy the game. The creative use of alternative methods (with double-sided cards) to try and find a victory won me over.

There were some interesting concepts in this dual-sided card deck building game, but it was hard to learn, fiddly to play, and didn't separate itself from the plethora of other deck builders out there. The art was awesome, but the theme didn't come through in gameplay.

A bit confusing due to its 4 (5?) different currencies, but the various evil exes make me want to replay it.

I love the theme-- seen the movie 20 times, own all the original books and all 6 collector's edition color versions with all the extras. So I bought this on sight and was going to have a Scott Pilgrim party centered on it with my friends.

However, there are some incredibly obvious problems in the design of the game that make me never wish to play it after the two times I have already, let alone host a party for it! More to the point, it's pretty clear that playtesting was mostly negligible or poor in scope, which to be fair is not unlike most themed tie-ins.

tl;dr-- this game is needlessly long with many tempo-halting design choices, when they should have made either A) a simpler game to tie in the theme that just reskins an existing success (like Ascension) or B) a better game that tries to use these mechanics. It's worse than the sum of its parts, and I strongly recommend against buying this. It is not just a bad deckbuilder, it's just an overall bad game.

1) Downtime is quite long as turns are effectively twice in a row (the buying turn then the combat turn, each player does both in a row). Our first three player game took about 2 hours, and no one is new to gaming/deckbuilders/etc. It's just a silly design choice. 45-60 minutes is really optimistic if each player is actually trying to win.

2) The three resources are very poorly implemented in terms of an engine. There are three resources, Red/Green/Blue (love, work, and music, respectively or something close to that). Cards that generate Blue mostly require Blue to buy...meaning it's really easy to not have enough to enable this chain. MORE IMPORTANTLY, if the market is saturated with Blue and your deck is Red-driven, you are mostly out of luck. If there was a default card you could buy that'd help. As is, it's very easy to clutter your deck with useless resources (and "wild card resource" cards are not especially efficient)

3) Fighting is extremely hard above some basic baseline level. It's hard to get cards that both don't clog your deck AND contribute to your combos as well as draw them. We lost probably 90% of the fights, when a better design would make that more like 50-60% to not enable fatigue each turn. In fact, we largely just ignored fights both times, it's rarely worth it.

4) The double-sided cards are  clunky to deal with, but that's somewhat minor. It's just awkward to not be able to orient cards in a particular way.

5) The box+insert is an obvious ploy to sell it for a lot of money. It is 100% cards, that's it. The number of cards could fit in a standard Magic deckbox, and the insert itself is not even designed for these cards. It's really stupid and lazy and, frankly, insulting. I know, I know, gamers complaining about box size is cliche, but here's is incredible how much Renegade wants to get away with. 

Good points:

1) Art is cute and thematic. 

2) Choosing characters is pretty fun.

3) That's mostly it.

Nice implementation of the theme. It's fun to fight challenges that range from evil exes and their henchmen to dramatic life situations. The different characters feel different, but there is a high amount of luck and risk to the play. I suspect it is best at 2p.

I'm not really a fan of the source material, but despite that, I thought this game was shit. Way too many options to consider on your turn, no "improved starter cards" you can buy when you can't afford anything else, and far too short to be taken seriously. The one thing that keeps me from rating this a 1 is the combat. That was an interesting mechanism of combining cards to score damage, but the rest of the game just felt a little too obtuse for its own good. Almost like this was a design being kicked around since Renegade was part of Cryptozoic.

Deck-building game. Recommended to play with 2p to keep from adding a long time play. Interesting double sided cards with multi purpose. I don't have a connection with the theme but I am sure anyone who likes Scott Pilgrim will find this game entertaining and enjoyable.

Awesome art obviously and the concept of the double-sided cards are interesting. Mechanics are not awful, but I can definitely see why people don't like the game - especially with the whole 'discard your whole hand and draw a new one for combat' rule.

What will be Renegade's 2017 new deckbuilding game.  so stoked!!  Just obtained 10/3/17.

RATING: 7
Co-op and solo seem like an after thought (solo-win in x turns/ co-op win in x turns but score twice as much)
The evil x's don't effect the game all that much (example is all robot challenges get a +1 to dificulty. There is only 6 robot cards in the deck)

You can win most rounds without fighting the evil x you selected.

Most games picking the x is all about what score you want to play to

The theme is good, the art is great and it is full of some fun moments 

The double sided cards is a fun enough feature that I would choose to play it over other deck builders

Theme is the only thing saving this game - it is awesome at being a Scott Pilgrim game.

The down-time between turns is terrible.

Got the SDCC 2017 variant box and played it. It was pretty fun and if you are a fan of the comic you will probably like too. You will love all the cards and references. Gameplay is simple and fun definitely a light filler game for Board game Nights for me.

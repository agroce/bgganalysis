I like a lot of ideas in this game.  I set it up and grew aggravated with the large stacks of 1/2" counters.  I put it up and was going to play on Vassal, but decided that wasn't for me, so I bought a pair of tweezers.

I give it a place holder 6 rating.  I think the game will be 7-worthy but the counters will remove some of my enjoyment and desire to get it to the table.

Fun game, and its pretty close when the Germans are struggling to take an airfield on Crete. The Axis ALWAYS win on Malta though when I play. Only fault with Malta IMHO is that the Italian units are waaayyyy overrated. Anyone else feel this way?

For those of you who like VonBorries' recent games (the Barbarossa series, Kasserine, Invasion: Sicily etc.), this has a lot of what makes those games in a small fraction of the complexity (<6pgs of rules). Plus the whole invasion thing is inherently appealing to me. Not a great game, but quite good and is the right complexity for somthing that'll get played only a handful of times.

The Crete game is really 3 or 4 separate games since the beaches & airfields are so far apart and almost all units lack any real mobility. OTOH, I've played the Malta game a lot. The Malta game is tight, quick and fun although I feel the need to tweak the Brit artillery down a notch.

RATING: 9
You get a hard map board depicting the northern shores of the island of Crete (Greece), a rules booklet and plenty of counters and markers. The Axis player gets the task of planning and executing the air assault. The Allied player (British, ANZAC and Greeks) has to defend and hold the island at all costs. The game portrays with realistic game mechanics: air bombardment, paradrops, gliders, capture of airfields, amphibious landings, AA guns, port activities and fog of war. The game is balanced and players are able to achieve more than their historical counterparts.
 
The same occurs at the island of Malta having a different map scale and the participation of Italian forces. In all attempts, the first game turn is the most crucial of all. 

In the past, if you have been reading the ‘The General’ magazine, you will also find an add-on to this game – The air assault to Cyprus. A hypothetical scenario of what might have happened had the Axis elected this target after Crete.

Definitely a game for Chaos gamers.  In one game, I had the experience, as the Germans, of getting mauled on landing (the HQ units were particularly unlucky) and brutally hammered turn after turn until I won.  Still haven't figured out how that happened, but it was a gratifying moment. My impression is that the Germans performed the same way historically.

It&#039;s funny, I&#039;ve owned this game for over 20 years and yet I&#039;ve never played it, nor have I ever considered selling or trading it. Why? Well I&#039;m sure of my reasons, but I don&#039;t know if they will match yours. The game is elegant, the maps are great, the subject matter is compelling, and the Malta game is unique. In effect, it was an SPI game published by Avalon Hill. Ignore the ugly cover and if you can find a copy, buy it - perhaps we could play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
While mine is a minority opinion, the bigger game of Crete is better than the mini-game of Malta.  Very quick to learn (but not to play!), clean, and tension-filled.  This is one of those games where no matter how bad it looks, there's still a chance to win for either side.  

The only other game that can compare is GMT's OPERATION MERCURY which is far more involved and not quite as fun.  SPI's old DESCENT ON CRETE was a disaster of a monstergame and only dealt with the Maleme sector.  The Gamers' HUNTERS FROM THE SKY deals with the Maleme airfield only at a very tactical level.  

One of my favorites from the late 1970s and a highly under-appreciated game.

This is a strange game to rate low because you have two good designers, working on what seems like an interesting situation, but the game just did not work for me. I’m not sure if there was a mismatch on the scale or situation or what, but it seemed after the initial set-up, there were not a lot of choices and the game dragged. I thought the set-up and airdrops were the most interesting parts of the game. This rating is based on Crete alone, which is the main game; I didn’t play the Malta scenario, but I hear that could be the better of the two.  There are some good design ideas here from what I recall that show-up to some extent in Randy Reed’s The Longest Day, which is a good game.

I used to write the starting locations on  the backs of single sided counters to aid in game set-up... which I did for this game (before I read the rules).  I had to buy another set of counters once I read the rules and found out that the pieces were played face down as a fog-of-war element.  Even after all that... I think that I only ever played the Crete game three times.  The Malta game was quicker and a lot more fun to play.

RATING: 7
I highly recommend this game.  If you can find it on Ebay, get it!  Here's a real bargain.  You get two games in one: Air Assault on Crete and Air Assault on Malta.  Both are well balanced and provide good simulations of the difficulty of large-scale air assault operations.  The game itself is company/battalion level and can be played in a reasonable period of time. The only drawback is that the Crete game needs a fairly large space to set up all the maps.  This, in my opinion, is one of AHGC's finest!

This is one of the greatest games ever made for solo players like me. The small Malta game can be played in an evening & the Crte game on a Saturday or Sunday. Not too complex but enough to make the game mechanics fast & easy. I usually play one or the other about once a month. 
      The Crete maps make it a little hard to use but instead of spreading them out left to right, I stack them top to bottom so each battle is easy to see & plan for.

RATING: 6
This was one of the first AH games to introduce jazzy multi-colored counters.  The breakdown of the paratrooper formations into lower echelon units, which have to reform after the scattering of the drop to be more potent, was an innovative mechanic.  This is a fun game, though the "traffic jam" of support units trying to rush off the south edge of the long board, while perhaps realistic, does not really ring true. Also, the play becomes repetitive. I have never played the Malta scenario also included in this game.   
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
My first "real" war simulation of the hex and chit type; my first one beyond the Risk/Axis-Allies type games. The only one my dad ever played with me. Me (and my ancestors) are former paratroopers.  So I am sentimental to this game.

Like:
Its recreation of the complexities of airborne operations. No other game EVER before or since has offered such a realistic, complex, difficult appreciation of airborne opns at the tactical and operational level.
The bonus game examining a Malta gambit.
The abstraction modelling and presumption of allied naval superiority and axis air superiority.
The game conditions are set that either player can "win" even though the German will probably take the island in most games the UK can "win".

Dislike:
A system that is not common to other AH games - little of its mechanics, "look-n-feel", and tactics transport into other AH games.
The abstraction modelling and presumption of allied naval superiority and axis air superiority.
The extra burden of all the non-combatant troops to have to protect and evac (the remnants of service troops form the ill-fated Greek intervention).
Goofy (to me) unit types and symbology. Seems this game uses a transient or archaic type of NATO-esque miulitary unit/type symbology that you don't find in other games (I think the epic large game Longest Day also suffers from that format).
A lot about this game is too unique and non-transportable to other hex boardgames of its genre or manufacturer.

If you can get past the set up(not very user friendly) and layout of the boards it's not too bad of a game.  Once the Germans land it is a tough and difficult fight for them to seize an airfield.  Once they do the British side needs to figure out how to salvage things, usually by evacuating!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It's a little fiddly, especially at the beginning when the German paratroops are dispersed, but it's a relatively simple game that plays well and is reasonably easy to learn. The initial placement of the Allied troops appears to be crucial, as the Allied player must aggressively inflict early casualties on the weak units before they combine while also protecting certain crucial hexes and preserving non-combat units for later evacuation. I think it would take at least three plays to get a handle on how to set up. The German initial drops are less troublesome, but maneuvering to attack Allied strong points can be difficult.

The rating is somewhat tentative, as I've only played once. It might be a 7, but the initial drop, with the various smaller units spread around, make it difficult and fiddly. This drops it to a 6 for me.

Interesting game with a lot of different strategies available and thus replay value. A bit put off by the "fiddliness" of some very tall stacks and the inverted hidden units on the Allied side which make things even "fiddlier".

Interesting 'classic +' AH games. I say classic + because it was one of AH's newer wargames cast in the classic mode with many additional rules covering paratroop/glider assualts. Games allowed for smaller 'component' unit counters to be used in place of parent unit counter a la the old Chancellorsville game. Crete game used map boards arranged in an uneven configuration. Malta used a single map board.

RATING: 6
I really, really, really wanted to like this game more. I found the Crete game cumbersome and dull, with three to four individual pockets of action. The Malta game offered more promise and, to a certain extent, delivered it. My comments refer to that game.

Ultimately, the mini game is marred by a clunky, unsophisticated CRT and by one step units. The result is unconvincing: attack stalled, defender retreat, or attacker retreat, etc. Everything is rounded down to the 'nearest' without nuances made for combined artillery and armour attacks etc, with the result that attacking is a process of counting factors rather than making more thematic decisions as to proper use of one's tanks and artillery.

Otherwise, the game stands up quite well, if you can get past the artwork which is composed of the same colours they liked to make carpets out of in those days. The decoy, blind set up is nice if fiddly and the air power adds an element too. The situation does come down to the wire. 

Ultimately, I only solo'd this as best I could. The poor man's CRT and one step units issue mightn't be as much of one against an enthusiastic ftf opponent. But the game's age would, I imagine, still be on display.

This was my first ever board wargame. The Malta mini game is particularly fun and you can win as the Brits so long as you nail enough paras to trigger the early para withdrwal - then have fun mopping up the Eyetie infantry.

Sold it in 2003. Not so bad. I particularly like the Malta game, even though the Germans have little or no chance of winning.

A solid design with almost glitch-free rules. I liked the contoured mountains on the map and the use of terrain and the ability of the German paratroops to break down.

I used to play this game alot, but it has been twenty years since my last airdrop! It was a favorite AH game of mine. Being a former paratrooper I appreciated the scattering and confusion of the airdrops. Once an airfield is captured (Maleme is the easiest} the Commonwealth should head for the evacuation routes. Usually intense to the end. I might rate this higher if I ever get around to playing Malta.

Being part Greek, I wanted to like this one.  As you might expect from an island scenario, the chit crowding was nightmarish.  It gets to the point where you're not moving a stack simply because you don't want to go through the headache of having to pick it up.

One play of Malta, basic rules. Rules are a bit difficult to use. Inverted counters are a pain. Axis aerial bombardment only needs to be done 'blind' on the Air Assault turns or when plans are for attacking inverted units, otherwise (when attacks are planned for known units) air units can be placed along with movement. Defensive artillery fire seems too versitile (selecting single units out of a stack). Axis airborne limit makes for a very brittle force than might be best in 'turtling' after a 'secure' beach landing zone is established. Seems to go against airborne 'elan'.

Friend had this one.  To be honest, I don't we ever played Crete, we always went for Malta.  It had that '2 scorpions in a jar' feel, very claustrophobic, with no way to disengage, the Germans jumped right into a mass of Brits and both sides hoped they would prevail.  Lots of fun, and pretty quick game, easily played in an afternoon.

Cumbersome game system with Allied units setup upside down to reflect German lack of knowledge concerning enemy deployment.  Paratroopers fight to seize the airfields to bring in reinforcements.  Slow movement costs plus lack of innovation make for a ho-hum game.  Interesting to analze but not to play.  My comments concern the Crete game, never played the Malta game based on the same system

This game is very tedious during the air drops, but it is a blast to play with three distinct drop areas and the drama of whether the convoys will arrive or not.  There are enough variables that each game plays a bit differently.  Not many people play this game, though.

RATING: 8
Enjoyable hex and counter invasion game. The actual invasion of Crete, plus the hypothetical invasion of Malta are included.  I recommend you get a hold of some counter stands to permit defending units to be hidden, for a greater fog-of-war experience.

Interesting topic.  Airborne invasion is much different from standard wargame fare.  The game uses the tried-and-true Avalon Hill wargame system, with CRTs, hexes, ZOCs, and the like.  Nonetheless, it feels different from other operational games, because of the airborne and amphibious invasions.  This game doesn't features the usual sweeping offensives, but rather scattered skirmishes to get the reinforcement beaches and airfields.  Both sides feel very different, but both have lots of very interesting decisions to make.  Not the first game I'd pull out to introduce wargamers to the genre, but it's still the definitive game on both Crete and Malta.

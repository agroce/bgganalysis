RATING: 9
Very thematic game about corporate behaviour at its worst (bribery, big money, firing, etc.) that is implemented using an area-control, limited action selection, and some other fairly unique elements, with a sudden death end-game condition.

This game is seriously underrated and overlooked.  It's a deep, thematic, and innovative euro-strategy game that is easy to play but difficult to play well.  It seems to have good scalability (although I feel a bit scammed by the 2-player box advertisement only to find that it doesn't really play 2 players!), and despite the fact that it seems to have real similarities to "In the Shadow of the Emperor" and "Tribune", it feels unique and worth owning in its own right.
Do not be turned off by the cartoonish box art or lack of hype- if you like euros, if you like "gamers games", this is for you.  Recommended.

This is an amazingly engrossing game. Every thing you do rewards or punishes. Controlling is cool, but it can distract you from getting precious points. I love it, even though I've only played 3-player games!

(Traded away solely because it doesn't get played. Quickly regretted that!)

2012-11-04: Rated after one play.  What to do / how to play didn't become apparent until midway through the first play.  I'm looking forward to playing again and trying out different strategies.  Half the group liked the game while the other half didn't.  

Sold November 2014.  I couldn't find anyone to get another play in.

I'm not sure what to think about this game yet. It seems to have a few problems - a few victory conditions are much more difficult than others making for an unbalanced play. Money is too easy to come by in general. The area control mechanic is alright, but a bit too complex for the result. So a mixed bag for me. And the English rules still have problems. I'll keep it yet and give it a few more goes - but I'm not sure that anyone in my group really enjoys it.

This needs 5 players who know the game well so I traded it away, I already have Container filling that niche market. The actions vs winning conditions are just too obscure, it feels like you should be money efficient when you should instead be action efficient, if I play again with newbies then I'll drum this point home before we start. Quite a lot of rules to get through too, I prefer Tribune for its more streamlined nature and better visibility of actions to winning conditions.

A good area control game that provides a few clear route to victory. Yet the routes you take is secret to everyone till mid way through the game, where gamers will notice your concentration at particular paths. 

The various powers, time at acquisition and time of usage is limited.

The theme is weak as the actions could have other back ground stories fitting them too. Did not really feel that you are an office worker with office politics in the mist of it all.

The map and components are beautiful and functional. Overall, a maximizing opportunity game that has a reasonable interaction between players.

Power Struggle has pretty good fidelity to its office politics theme.  Everyone is an empire builder, reorganizations are frequent and the broken foosball table in the staff lounge is never repaired.  

Power Struggle also has an intriguing mix of mechanisms: area control that isn't an end in itself, instead it fuels actions that will gain victory points; action selection from - yikes - nine or ten options; special powers with Communications' control of the order of random events and the length of the turn, both the most powerful and the most difficult to use well); six different ways to score a victory point; and bribery. 

I find bribery a bit odd, particularly when players recognise that they are in the end game.  Offering or accepting a bribe moves me up the corruption track towards a victory point.  The privilege I am trying to get or keep and the money offered matter far less. Money is too plentiful and too insignificant.  

There isn't quite the level of interaction I would hope for from a game in which players pass envelopes stuffed with bills and jostle for control of divisions.  Ultimately Power Struggle feels too much like a grinding optimisation exercise in which a combination of four different goals is achieved in the minimum number of turns.

Production quality is good and the artwork is quite pleasing.  The Z-Man rules are a great improvement on the original Eggert edition.

Too me this game seems like a mixed bag of game mechanics. It's not a simulation and it's not a clean game system either. It's a Eurogame!

A [gameid=242]-style corporate game would have been much liked by me. Now I have played a game, that doesn't feel like corporate politics.

RATING: 7
Power Struggle was a pleasant surprise, a well designed, thematically strong game with area majority placements affecting income and "extra powers," stock purchasing decisions, and an amusing corruption mechanic.  In addition, the game features a nice "race to be the first one" victory condition.  

Replayability might be a concern, and it is a bear to teach, but all in all, this game should provide solid gaming fun for most euro gamers.

I am really impressed with the amount of interesting mechanisms in this game that drive player interaction and make for only a 90 minute game. The theme appears especially interwoven with the game mechanics, which is always a pleasure to experience for me. Now that I am familiar with the game, I can focus on the player interaction more and try to deduce others' interests and goals, which makes the game experience all the better.

RATING: 4
It's been a long time since I've run into a game that I didn't want to play again this badly.  I'm really not a fan of the area majority mechanic, and this is one of the prime mechanics.  The corporate world theme is also a big turn-off for me.  Firing workers to gain influence, and having to bribe to climb the corruption ladder were particularly unappealing.  Add to this the fact that the game seems particularly dry, and you get one that has vast unappeal quotient for me.  I think that I spent too long in the corporate world and have seen too many painful real world parallels.

This is a very personal evaluation based on a few key items.  I think that for others, this could be a very enjoyable game, it just manages to hit all the wrong buttons for me.

Plays best with 5.

First impression = wow!

What a wondefully cynical evil game, where all players compete to basically be the new Mr. Burns (the loser becomes smithers).  

While ive not totally wrapped my head around it, it feels like a worker placement game, where the mechanic for actially PLACING your worker is area control.

The other beautiful thing about this game is that the things you want are frequently not the things you actually want to try and aqcuire (at least not through conventional means)...you typically want to possess the things that someone ELSE wants and bribe away the benifits you really need.

it's surprising how much variety and depth there is in a system that constantly is shifting around beneath you.  Yet despite all that flux it does not FEEL chaotic.

Cant wait for more plays.

In spite of having the aspect of an economic game, this is more a tricky area control game, full of "atmosphere": you can really see all the people struggling to reach the top spots in the company.
The gameplay is very interactive, and I'd like to highlight the bribery and archenemy mechanics, that are very well themed and functional.
The production is quite awesome, with nice wooden and cardboard components, and a beautiful board. There are some small unclear points in the english rules, but nothing that can't be fixed after a reading on BGG.
In the end, an enjoyable game I'd like to play again...

RATING: 8
After working through the rather complex rules, having a few actions with no straight plan, I came slowly into the game and did understand the way the game works. Even with a reminder card, and because of the many choices and preveliges it's still a lot to know which action to choose. But I liked the system and hope to play this game some more. The way to win the game (4 of 6 criteria) is unusual and makes me curious for the next game(s)
Second play was much easier (and fast). Looks like I will like this game.

First Play: The rules cause absolute head spin. There is alot to take in here before you even have a chance to crunch that data into any sort of strategy. The enemy cards are an inspired way to limit draws and a good way to channel all players into different avenues of opportunity.

When the fog lifts there is alot going on with this game and it all gels together beautifully. I look forward to my next game soon.

Unfortunately my second game took nearly 2 years so the struggle with the rules was mirrored as I'd forgotten almost everything. And what I remembered it looked liked we'd played wrong in the first outing. Eitherways still a fantastic game, it really does need more table time.

The rules are vague and flakey in places so remember:

1/ 'Experience' on the secret target cards actually means the far right hand 'Counsel' column.
2/ Priviledge cards are not flipped when used.
3/ The share bonus is per tile not per 'share'.
4/ When an old Div head loses his post to a new div head, the old DH is moved to the board or counsel area.

This is basically The Office: The Game. At it heart, it is a very simple, yet nasty, worker placement game with hidden goals to trigger the endgame. In practice, it is difficult to teach as the rules have that awful tendency to use weird names for very simple things. This can be found on the cheap, and if you see it, you should try it!

Meaty game with a lot of interaction between the players. Still it plays very smooth and quick for such a game. The theme fits the gameplay seamlessly which is also nice for a so called euro. There are a lot of options you have to weigh each turn as your actions are limited. Another problem you face is that you don't know exactly how limited they are. The bribing aspect of the game is brilliant. You can really mess people over by making them an offer they literally can't refuse. Just be carefull as the price you get is not always what you expect. A very solid design where the only problem seems to be that the game can be overwhelming and hard to graps for a new player.

First play impressions:

My initial impressions are very positive for this unique title. The game is basically a race for controlling areas while using special powers that may be acquired each round. How you get the special powers, how to implement them and how to gain the area control in the "four of the six categories to win" is what is intriguing. 

For seasoned gamers, the rule seem obtuse at first, but after a round or two it all fits together reasonably well and you can concentrate on decisions versus rules. Player interaction is aplenty, but not enough to detract or hinder your plans. All special powers seem strong, but balanced depending on your strategic path. Tension and opaqueness in the race to win and plenty of table talk and interaction makes this a winning combination for me. All in all, I'm looking forward to getting this title to the table again.

Thankfully, there's not much negotiation in the game despite the BGG category for this game.  It's mostly a race to meet 3 of 6 victory conditions through area influence (majorities), economics and some bribes.  The bribing system seems to be unbalanced (being a bit too favorable for the briber).

UPDATE 2012:  This game is essentially a race to complete X of Y victory conditions (4 of 5, or 3 of 5 if you've bested your arch-nemesis in all 3).  The rules sound complex and tedious, but once you play a few rounds it all makes sense and fits together nicely.  There is some bluffing and a weird bribing mechanic that often involves making insultingly low bribes just to advance yourself on the corruption victory condition track.  From the rules, the game sounds like a simplistic and boring majorities affair, but it's actually fairly tense and competitive.  I enjoy the race to complete X of Y genre of games (e.g., Trajan, Anno 1503) so even though Power Struggle is an area control/majorities game, I can see myself playing it occasionally.

RATING: 6
There are a LOT of rules in this game, but that's because there are lots of options to consider when it is your action.  Although totally a Euro, this game definitely requires more commitment than a typical Euro... But it's very rewarding if you can get a group of players together who've played it once already and understand the machinations. I very much appreciate the theme and usually have a good time explaining the game because of the theme.  Who doesn't want to play a game where you can bribe the head of the R&D Division just so you can steal that same player's employee away and force him to close one of his departments!  YES!

Had a great discussion with friends about this game last night and realized how imbalanced this game really is.  Counsel positions are BAD, Stock is impossible, and having the wrong Rival or bad VP charts can be a killer.  The theme and some of the mechanics are REALLY fun in this, but overall it just isn't a great game in my mind.  Bummer...

Power Struggle was an absolute surprise (more so when I realized it was published so recently). The rules read like a modern euro. Describing it, it sounds like a modern euro. At the beginning of each round, one player creates an event deck that determines the number of turns in a round. Each turn, players can do a single action that helps them move forward on one of several tracks or makes it more likely to get a special power for the next round. The first player to get high enough on 4 tracks (or to beat his secret arch-enemy in 3 tracks) wins. OMG. I heard/read that and thought point salad, area control game. Yeah.... no, that's not how it plays out. 

First off, I won the game on the first or second action in Round 3. My guess is with experienced play, it's possible to win in Round 2. That's somewhere between 10 and 14 actions in the game. Every action is precious. Actions often affect other players and so there's this screwage feeling. Sometimes it is screwage, but more often than not, the action is helpful to both players, allowing players to advance on tracks (or position themselves to advance) even when it's not their turn. And once you see that and how fast the game can end, the whole feeling changes. Now, it's a race where players need to keep strictly to the path they planned while relying on other players to help move them along. Amazing game. After one play, I'm expecting to keep this long term.

More or less standard majority mechanisms, but with a fresh theme. Flavor text on event cards and some of the interrelations between actions are likely to produce a laugh for anyone working in an office environment of a not too small company.

For me, the ability of one "role" to determine the length of the action rounds (within a limit) was a nice, innovatoive detail. Also the Tribune style winning conditions are not used that often.

Don't let the poor choice of a silly cartoon cover fool you. This is one juicy meaty game that has some interactive mechanics that come together well. Great theme and the mechanics make you feel like you're in that dirty corporate world climbing to the top.

Game explanation can be lengthy but gameplay is not. The game is not easy to understand nor intuitive but it is innovative and unique.

It has an overall fresh approach to game mechanics. Not easily comparable to any thing other games. The closest would be a hint of In the Shadow of the Emperor (which is another gem that is grossly underrated here).

One extra bonus is that it is a heavy, meaty satisfying game that plays in 90 to 120 minutes!

One of the best of Essen 2009.

Update Sep 2011 to Aug 2012. Dropped rating from 8.5 to 7.5 It's a bit dry after a few more plays. Plus there seems to be advantage to the player getting himself as the nemesis.

Revisited July 2017. Revised to 7. It still holds up in terms of theme. The winner was again the player with himself as nemesis.

Certainly works much better with more players.  I found that the 5 player game had a lot more tension and was a lot more interesting than with 3.

Multiple paths to victory, although it does seem that the initial archenemy setup gives some players an immediate advantage over others, depending on what the overlap of conditions are.   It's not a game-breaker, but could be improved to give all players a fair starting point.

An innovative area majority game where winning the majority in an area gives you a unique special power. A fun theme, great story arc and engaging game play are hampered by a clunky rule set.

Teaching and learning this game will test your patience in a way that few others can, as evidenced by the fact that almost nobody has played this more than 10 times. It is not a game for non-gamers.

Fun and unusual.  Only played once, and although I know exactly what I wanted to do, I just never had enough of an opportunity to do it.

This game is the antithesis for [gameid=33154] for me.  Although there are cetainly things that you have to do to win the game, there are other things that you can do to "correct" any perceived errors that you may have made, and improve your position.  So, whereas I think the gameplay can be very similar with Wasabi! in terms of where you place your workers/tiles/ingredients, Power Struggle has a better built-in mechanism to make "fixing" ones situtation more palatable.  You will still suffer from mistakes, but it won't ruin the rest of your game due to its brokenness like Wasabi!

This is definitely something that I need to play again and again before I get the hang of it, but I have this strange feeling that this game will be my equivalent of golf - I love playing it, but I completely suck at it, and will probably never get better.  But I want to play it again after having just played miserably.  THAT is the sign of a great game!

RATING: 5
Rated "9" after one play. Wow! Of all the "heavier" games I own, I can't think of a game that has such a solid integration of theme and mechanics. This game is a blast. Want to skim some money off the top? Take over controlling. Don't like certain employees? Choose legal and sh*tcan them.  It's just awesome.

You've got nondescript gray cubes representing employees. Cards that reference the spa on the executive level and the lack of dessert in the cafeteria. I just love it.

The only thing hard about the game is the diversity of action choices. There's a lot you can do on a turn, and during our first play, it's easy to regret some choices. But all that did was create a burning sense to try the game again.

Oh yeah--the English rulebook is a real burden. But the effort to sort through it (with the assistance of BGG resources) is well, well worth it.

Update: 2nd play, and I'm dropping it to an 8. The reason why is that, compared to some other games of similar weight, Power Struggle presents a dizzying array of choices on your turn. You've got about 8 or 10 possible actions... it's a bit overwhelming. At the same time, a group willing to commit to playing this game with some regularity may overcome that barrier, and at that point, the game could really start to shine. Until then, it's an 8 for now.

Update: the bribery mechanic bugs me. Too often in our game I was forced to offer a lowball bribe, simply to bump myself up on the bribery track. I love the idea of the mechanic, but if falls flat in actual gameplay.

Update: Dropped to a 6, and traded away along with some cash for Planet Steam. With some games, I end up finding one or two nagging quirks or clunky mechanics that sour on my enjoyment, even though the rest of the game may be sound. I couldn't get past the excess of choices on a player's turn, and the ho-hum bribery mechanic. It's a good game that I'm sure others will enjoy, but for me, this would lose out to all the other titles I'm still itching to play in my collection.

What a quirky game! For sheer thematic wackiness and mechanismic bizarritude, I am going to say I dig it and will happily play again. The value of the roles is likely to continue to be an interesting problem for a while; the increased value to the briber (and the inherent value of being part of a bribe) is a cool twist.

This is all fixed in current version. Very solid, and more importantly original, game that I'm sad to see go for pennies on Tanga.

Wow. I actually work in a big company, and this really feels like working in a company. And it's a lot of fun. It's a long game, but we had one spectator who said he thought watching the game was at least as much as playing. The goal of the game is simple: be the first player to get to 4 points. One of the cool things is that there are various tracks you can progress on [i]toward[/i] your one point in each of those tracks. And 1 point can be from a secret goal. This game feels pretty different from anything else I've played. The bribe mechanic alone is awesome. There are strong incentives for the player on the receiving end of the bribe to accept, which makes getting bribed feel awful, which is a pretty good model.

Power Struggle is, to me, a very, [i]very[/i] rare exception that I never get turned off by a subject. I detest office politics with a passion—as it gets in the way of the primary goal of a company, making money—but put more than two two humans together and there will of course be politics. It took me a while to ignore the subject and see the game for what it was: somewhat contrived majority battling and occasionally letting go of departments because a game goal required focussing on some other aspect of all the interactions. Now I like majorities, so it stands to reason I'm predisposed to like Power Struggle. But not in this case: the game went on for far too long to be pleasant, mostly because at some point players could create lockout situations between themselves in order to hit on an archenemy even if their goals were different. I get it, you want your enemy to kept short... but this is not true office politics, it is a game. Get a move on! Due to such lengthy fights, the 90 minutes of fun were stretched into 150 minutes of boredom. 

Perhaps this is just inexperience, but it certainly had an effect on me. The game's owner has indicated that he'd like to play again, but to date the box hasn't hit the table, and that is fine with me as far I'm concerned. I'm not really sure what would change in a new attempt... but hey, stranger things have been known to happen. I'm a bit harsh with the rate, but I promise I'll review it in due time.

Based on comments and reviews, we were hoping this was a solid negotiation game. However, the negotiations in the game are limited to secret bribes between only two players. There is definitely none of the open-ended negotiation of games like Genoa, Chinatown or even Intrigue.

The game itself is not bad, but nothing seems particularly special about it. Some majority type mechanics mixed with some variable roles and a race to 4VP (or 5VP, for the longer game).

Fun theme:  Corporations are evil.  Oppressing workers is good.  Bribes are status quo.  We're all fighting each other within the company to make it to the top.  

The mechanics have a nice mix of solitary Euro resource managment intermingled with a little bit of underhanded messing with people's plans.

My biggest complaint is that the game is very difficult to learn.  Much more difficult than it should be.  This is partly because almost every rule has a slight exception, and partly because the names were poorly thought through.  For instance, there are departments, department heads and major departments.  It's hard to get this straight when you're trying to learn the possible actions, because they all sounds somewhat the same, and get jumbled together.  They have a weird victory point cash earning thing which they call "stock", but does not work at all the way you'd expect stock to work.  It would have been easier to learn the game if they had called it "stuff".  

So the game is fun, but I have to knock my rating down a bit because of all the rough edges.

RATING: 6
After only one play - quite fiddly, and so many actions possible that it is overwhelming and somewhat innacessable in terms of planning a strategy. This will obviously improve with more plays but the question then remains as to whether you will like what reveals itself. Some of the Dept Head/Division head board manager promotions/actions are not intuitive and some of it feels a bit gamey rather than thematic. 

On first sight the dept's part of the board gives the impression of being a proper spatial board but play reveals this not to be so - you can play and move anywhere - for me this is always a problem - I like a board which is a little bit more than just holding boxes but that is all this is - very pretty though. This does mean that the more players there are the more chaotic it becomes - if everyone decides it benefits them to have a go at you there is no positional defence - they can all get to you.

It's not bad - it just didn't grab me although I haven't ruled out that it might once the struggle to work out what actions you can do and there affect become better known.

Only played once using the terrible English rulebook that leaves out half the game it seems. Nice idea but the game didn't work at all for me. Getting yourself as arch enemy is too powerful and the different goals are not balanced at all. Bribing is too weak unless we got that rule wrong as well, which is not unlikely.

Good try, but not good enough for me.

Update: After second play with correct rules my statement above still holds true.

A game you will be a bit confused by alle possible actions you have to choose from. When playing, it will make more clear what to play. The rules are sometimes confusing (especiialy when ressinging, what to do with department managers and employees of other players. The picture makes it clear).

Power Struggle is definitely the best game of the year, and may very well end up in my Top 10 before too long. It is a very interactive game with very few zero sum interactions. In the places where you can directly take something from another player, you will almost be giving something in return. The tricky thing is ensuring that what you give them does not help them more than it helps you, as many of the ways where you move against someone else’s position result in that player moving closer to the game’s victory conditions without having to take any actions of their own, and considering the limited number of actions you have in the game, anything that gives a player the ability to move closer to victory without any action on their part can be very, very valuable. 

These interactions are but one attraction the game holds for me, but are not the only thing that make the game stand out. Like Tribune, you need to achieve four out of six potential victory conditions in order to win the game. Each of these requires a different set of conditions to pull off, interlocking in interesting ways that make it so there is no clear power combo between any two. On top of the, one of the victory conditions is to defeat one, specific opponent on three different tracks at the exact point when you have achieved three of the other victory conditions. 

I enjoy this game, but rarely get it to the table anymore, in part because its best player count is not one that I see regularly. Alas.

I have since sold the game to a home that will give it more love and attention.

Very different feel than anything else I've ever played. A very entertaining blend of tactics, obvious taking advantage of other players' weeknesses (like misjudgement and greediness), and if you want, a bit of bluffing (by not instantly racing up the tracks you need to beat your archenemy).
My experience and rating come from 3 player games only and could very well change significantly in both ways over the next gameplays as I feel this game has still a lot to be discovered.

One of the most unique games I've come across. It delivers on strategic game play, theme, and table talk; we always laugh a good bit when we play this one. Like Tribune, you're racing to a small set of VPs (4 of 6) such that the game could last as few as 4 turns (though ours go a couple more than that). You need to get untracked quickly in terms of putting your actions to effective use. If you don't like that kind of pressure, then this game isn't for you. In a nice twist, one of the possible victory conditions is to outdo your assigned secret archenemy in some of the categories.

Each turn one person (the Communications Director) puts a set of event cards in order which determine how many action rounds there will be (from 4 to  7).  Each action round you can take one of several actions such as add people to the board, move people, dissolve departments, buy stock, etc.  This ignorance on the other players part of how many rounds there will be adds a nice layer of tension to the game because you don’t know how much time you have each turn to get done what you want. Should I resign that guy now or buy stock? Will there be another turn so I can get done all I want? You compete in the areas for special powers, but can always just bribe somebody to get one of them, plus bribing gives you corruption points (a VP category).

I feel a comparison with Tribune is inevitable – I've come to sour on Tribune somewhat and strongly prefer PS. You have a lot more control over your fate than in Tribune where turn order and the cards can betray you. While both games are similar in the race to a set of victory conditions, their styles are quite different. Tribune relies on set collection and blind-bidding whereas Power Struggle is about area control and effective use of special powers. 

So far, the game seems wide open in terms of strategies, though recently one player did immediately buy up a bunch of small stocks so as to make a bit of a money engine and I suspect we'll all try to do that from now on. But as far as going about bribing vs. adding workers vs moving them, it seems like there's no obvious path here. I'm several plays in and still trying to become more efficient.

To counter a complaint I've heard -- since you only need 4 of 6 VPs, I didn’t mind that the archenemy avenue isn’t always an option. I would have a problem with it if you were required to achieve it, but as it's optional, it's not a show-stopper. 

I only ever play with 5P, so I can't comment on other player counts. I much prefer the maximum allotment for as many competing douchebags as possible.

The bribe mechanic and arch enemies are what really sets this game apart.  The one thing I don't like is with the amount of control you have, it's a bit too easy to follow a particular path and given the arch enemy card it seems the strongest play to pursue the three categories on the card and only worry about a fourth once it appears you won't get the arch rival win condition.  Honestly, though, I think if you don't achieve the arch rival, someone else will, and you have a much diminished chance of winning.  

I can't help but compare the game to Tribune and find PS a little bit flat in comparison.  The extra hand management aspect in tribune is just more interesting, and throw in the expansion pushing it to 6 players and there's not really much contest for me and it unfortunately loses a point right there just because I'd always suggest Tribune instead.

Power Struggle is an "office simulation". Basically, it's an area majority game with a few twists. While many of the mechanics used are known from other games, Power Struggle often slightly changes the way they work or adds some icing to the cake (archenemies, for example). However, as much as I liked some of the ideas I did feel like the game didn't get the balance quite right, and some things outright bothered me.

Main departments seem to be quite a bit stronger than many of the other tracks, and players with the bad fortune to not have that track as one of their goals seem to be at a disadvantage (plus, it's also the easiest track to get a VP for). It also feels somewhat wrong that in many situations I want someone else to take a division away from me. Not only does this give my division head the opportunity to move onto the board or into the external consultancy business for free, it also means that someone else will get the often not very attractive division special power, so I can bribe them to get it back which will actually make it stronger and often quite useful.

Now, I'd certainly like to play this again to see if that was just the one game I played, but so far it didn't quite convince me.

I had Power Struggle on my shelf for years. I never really wanted to play it because it just looked like a chore to teach and I don't really like games with weird rules that serve the game more than the theme. That being said, there was something interesting about it - enough that I kept around. Well I finally got to playing it! And I'd say... it works... as a game... but... yeah - it's just not fun.  I'm not sure what it was. Perhaps that game was trying so hard to be a thematic game of humour at a corporation as you wrest for control on the departments and board of directors. But the humour was really limp and mostly non-existent.  Otherwise it was a muddy game of area majority with some really neat ideas - which at least didn't make the experience annoying or frustrating. It was just - everything fell flat and there was no enjoyment from anyone (except whatever you could squeeze out of the 'bribing').  Was that it? Was this JASE that tried way too hard to escape its roots? I think so. Power Struggle tries to be way more than it is.  If it was thoroughly reworked and rethemed, it could actually be something quite enjoyable. The variable player powers is really neatly implemented here. That mechanism alone could definitely be used elsewhere.

About the fiddliest game I've ever played, other than wargames.  The game basics are simple enough, but the options for adding and rearranging your departments will take a long time to explain.  Having said that, my gaming group, who usually play games like In the Year of the Dragon, are up for trying it again--someday.  Be sure and remember that if you control the Division Head but someone else then takes control of that Division, you get to choose to either move your outgoing Head to become a Board member or a Counsel--it's as though you took the Resign as Division Head action, but without affecting anyone in your offices in that division.  Easy rule to miss.

At it's heart this is a game of taking actions to generate scores in categories, which if you reach high enough, gain you a VP.  Within these categories, there are lots of tactics and area majority bonuses which help you on your way.  More could have been done with the theme.  Overall, gameplay is solid, and the bribery adds a nice twist to the tactics.

RATING: 5
The printed rules are a mess, but I was lucky to get a used copy with the revised rules. The game is fiddly and unintuitive, but it successfully mixes a number of common mechanics: area control, special powers, bribing, hidden objectives, and victory conditions a la "Anno 1503" (fulfill X conditions out of Y). The archnemesis idea is nice, but may create some serious imbalance. The game works, but it lacks that something special, even though it does not really feel similar to anything from which it borrows. But how exciting can be a game about work? The box art misleadingly suggests a humorous treatment of the climbing-the-corporate-ladder theme. It is all about greed, selfishness and corruption, and humor would have made that a lot more palatable, but unfortunately there is none.

I was looking forward to trying this.  It was an enjoyable game, but that's cause I was the 'Communications' person at least half the game.  It seemed like turns where I got that post were MUCH more interesting then other turns.  It does worry me a bit, when one person can be that much more involved with a game then others.  Granted it makes that even more of an intense battle.  But, again an area that 'seems' to make the game more interesting then other places.

My one major complaint, which may be different with repeated play was that EVERYONE could have won in the same turn.  Granted a few had more actions needed to finish, but others could do it in the same number of actions.  So, it was all about turn order.

While I don't fully get the comparisons with Tribune, this part I will compare to Tribune.  If Tribune didn't end so often with 'basically' a tie with most people ending at the same time, I'd play it more often.  This game might end up in the same boat for me.

I like games where you are never 'out of the game', but this one might be a little too much.

Juego de mayorías. El tema esta chulo porque nos recuerda a cualquier empresa medianamente grande donde hayamos estado pero a mi el juego me resulto insípido y plano con varios mecanismos que tomados por separado están bien pero que unidos no forman un juego elegante.

El juego tiene curva de aprendizaje porque es complejo, demasiadas acciones entre las que elegir sin un objetivo claro en cada una de ellas, por lo que se necesitan varias partidas para sacarle jugo, el principal problema es que el juego no me atrapo lo suficiente como para tener ganas de volver a jugarlo.

Los distintos objetivos se antojan desequilibrados, hay también un objetivo secreto basado en una carrera personal con otro jugador que no encuentro nada interesante en su desarrollo y el track de PV de corrupción es un poco absurdo porque te obliga a sobornar si o si en todas las rondas que puedas.

Tiene un nivel de caos aceptable, pero en este caso el jugador que controla Comunicación tiene mucho poder sobre lo que va a pasar en el turno sin que los otros jugadores puedan intervenir.

Recuerda a Tribuno. que prefiero por encima de este que me resulta indiferente.

It took me a second play to appreciate this; moreso than any other Euro in recent memory, this one takes a play before you can understand what's going on. You want to lose things, not hold them; money is almost entirely useless, unless you have a crapload; actions are extremely scarce, and the victory conditions obscure... There's a lot to process.
But it's brilliant. The bribery system alone is a work of art unto itself.

Underrated worker-placement / area control game with a corporate theme. I always enjoy playing this, but sometimes find it hard to convince a group to play (and it is a tough one to teach too).

This game matches its theme perfectly; what you do with these cube matches all too often the real world consequences of the things it mimicks - and that can be a turn off; humor is there, but it's dark humor.  Corporate boys will argue that things are exagerated, but I do not think so.

Theme aside, it's a game build around area majority, but where the areas won are difficult to evaluate in terms of victory; the values are shifting, and the additionnal victory point you get from your secret nemesis only makes it harder.  Lots of interaction, it's a great game when I am in the mood for dark humor and a reminder of what the corporate world can be at times.

Rating after 1 play. I see a few problems here. One, extremely non-intuitive rules. Two, it seems like players that draw their own card have the huge advantage that nobody is picking on them. Three, and this may be group dependent, but hardly any bribes happened at all. In fact I never bribed anyone because I had no use for the corruption track and because I never had enough cash to make it worthwhile. On the up side I did like the myriad ways of collecting your points, even if it took most of the game to figure out what they were.

Now that I've had a chance to play this with others, there are some pros and a couple cons that I noticed without playing alone.

The competition for divisional heads on the bottom becomes a very interesting area control competition.  In particular, Development is far more powerful than I first realized.  Using low bribes to strip employees away can be a great tactical choice that also works towards scoring.  It's a delicate balance which also enhances the value of Human Resources, and I really like how it's tuned.

Bribery is of course going to be more interesting when actually playing with other people.  The "secret sleeves" are a nice touch, and there can be some interesting exchanges of money for privileges.  Especially if someone is ready to retire in a division, but make some money off the bribe first, the timing could make for some great backstabbing opportunities.

I really like the archenemy mechanism, though on my first play with other people, we each drew ourselves.

On that note though, a big con.  You need to play with people who want to understand the game and win.  Similar to Container, where one person can bring the economy to a crawl or kingmake, this game can very easily kingmake or wreak havoc on the divisional heads.  One of our players decided (by random) to place 5 departments in Development.  Of course, there's no chance to overtake that if she was intent on holding it.  She made no effort to actually score any points, and instead decided to choose the other player to strip employees away from and attack.  In order to maintain his area, he had to spend turns getting employees and fending off her attacks, leaving me open to hold Accounting and the Board room, easily winning.

On that note, if we had drawn other people, whoever drew her as the archenemy would have had a lot easier time getting the archenemy point.  If even one player is unbalanced, the archenemy can become a very different point for each person to get.  I find it both interesting and frustrating.  I do look forward to playing this again with the same group who now hopefully understands the game, or with a group who is willing to learn and actually play the game to win.

I really wanted this game to be better.  It has a great looking board, nice game pieces, etc.  But it just didn't play "well."  I mean, it seemed as if it was better NOT to control a department than it was to control it.  There was little benefit in controlling departments until late in the round IF morale dropped low enough.

I don't get the sense there is enough tension, as money comes too easily. Bribes didn't seem to be playing a role in winning the game.

Hidden victory objectives are interesting, but it is rather disappointed to have the game suddenly end because of it. Somewhat an unsatisfying game.

(note this game is falsely labeled a negotiation game, there is NO negotiation just bribery, the admin did not want to include Bribery as a legitimate mechanic?????)


BRILLIANT GAME! 

A game about the corporate world where players are competing to become the most successful "operator" inside a large company (more or less). 

What you have on the board is the inner workings of a big corporate company, board of directors, different divisions, division heads, managers, employees, and at the very top a "chairman". It is your job to manipulate things as much in your favour in order to get 4 VP's out of the 6 possible, these are done on VP tracks (ladders) a little similiar to GOA but there are no abilities gained on the ladder, you just have to climb them to get the points.  

Wow just loved this game from the get-go. The explaination was long about 45 minutes as there is lots going on and takes a couple of rounds to get into the flow but once it gets going its very very cool, a very dynamic and fluid game, lots changing and moves quickly with no AP so don't be scared by people saying there is "too much" going on, meaty yes, too much no way. 

A VERY original and VERY thematic game that cant be compared to anything out there, slight shades of ITSOTE and GOA but you might as well compare Monopoly and Age of Steam. Might be most like Tribune but honestly I never even noticed until seeing comments here, the bribery aspect, theme and some other things really set  this apart from that title too. Nothing really new per se and its actually largely an area influence game but I tell you what, it does NOT FEEL like one at all, that is how strong the theme is (not up to FF standards, for a Euro). You hire workers and managers for influence, resign a position to explore another avenue in the company, switch divisions, promote a division head, etc, etc you are doing these things to change influence but honestly it feels more like you are doing it for "corporate power" and its all part of the typical politics and shenenagins you would expect inside a big company, overall I just really dont feel like I am playing an area control game at all but that is the main machanic along with bribery and variable powers. 

BRIBERY - oh how I love you, hehe. I loved it in Santiago and its even better here, and there is WAY more of it here. Very thematic and very evil, great fun! Each Division head has a special ability to help him along in the game, players can be a head in several Divisions so they will have several powers. These abilities can be bribed away IF the player being bribed accepts the cash. Bribing is encouraged and bribing and accepting bribes is one of the ways to get a VP! Sweet. 

SCREWAGE - Some little elements here that also stick with the theme like above. One ability lets you entice employees away from other players. Resigning as a Div. head means that particular power is no longer available, so if someone bribes it away from you and you want to be nasty and it fits into your agenda, accept the cash and then resign, they lose the power! hehe Note that these are mostly small things and none of them are going to "ruin" you or your game IMO.  

POWERS - These are a big part of the game and help you do things more efficiently essentially. Note that when a power is bribed away from someone it is more powerful so another incentive to bribe here (love it!) When someone does not accept the bribe, you actually fire one of their employees! Bad, how dare you not be corrupt LOL.    

HIDDEN ASPECTS - Dont be scared by this, they are relatively small and they actually put a very nice element of intrigue in the game. You have a secret agenda card and an Arch Rival card. If you are ahead of your arch enemy in all areas of your agenda you gain one VP. It can be hard to be subtle about your card but you do need at least one more VP not even on the card and the card is not necessary to win at all, getting 4 VP's without it no problem it just gives you one more option. 


NO LUCK (despite what the disgruntled poster below says, see my communications comment in next paragraph) and Multiple paths to victory here, several ways to skin the cat and a strategic game to be sure. There are going to be several approaches you can take and different combos of ladders you will use, your agenda card might dictate which way you go but doesnt have to. I think around 6 games to see all of them clearly (just a guess here) which is pretty nice so some nuances to explore. After one game my rating was 8.5 and I had a couple small concerns on whether the tracks were balanced as well as the secret goal cards, after game 2 I now rate it 9. I do think the tracks are balanced although I still think Council might slightly be easiest and the secret cards that have this on it will benefit the owners (easy tweak if true anyway, 3->4) but this is not confirmed yet and is not a big deal overall, everyone can go for this ladder if they want.  I thought the share track was too hard to climb after game one, turned out to be proven wrong in game 2, now it might be influence by a nose but I have a feeling that is for a reason too, things were very well thought out in this game and playtested. 

One other hint here, the Communications division is pretty good, make sure it is well fought over. This person does decide how many turns each round will have and that is valuable information. On the flip side, not knowing can make planning a little tricky (and this adds a bit of push your luck) BUT you do know there will be at least 4 rounds and max 7 AND when the payment card comes up it can tip everyone off that it COULD be the final round. Also there are some events which come up randomly in the game that have relatively very SMALL effects overall and mostly effect everyone (ie each dept head pays 100K), the communications dept head also gets to decide the order of these and can even stop some of them from coming out so a powerful positon indeed. Overall there is no luck, a slight touch of randomness (which one player knows ahead) and a very slight bit of player chaos (ie. someone steals one employee from another player). These effects are very low overall, some can even be mitigated so clever play is the name of the game IMO.  

Lots of interaction, room for clever play, intrigue, FUN and when the game starts accelerating, exciting. In our second game I could hardly sit still because I knew how close everyone was to winning, the tension was thick and it turned out we were all going to have 4 VP's on the exact same turn! very close and looks to be pretty balanced.  This might scale pretty good not really sure on this one, 4 was a great number though, 3 'might' be weakest because the hidden role card might become more important (easier to hit, not confirmed). 90 Minutes should actually be the play time which is awesome IMO and actually its almost impossible to go over 2 hours the way the game is setup. It could be 'slightly' group dependant on how well the theme comes out, a good competitive group should get right into this. If you try hard enough you 'might' be able to ignore the theme and just see cubes on a board....you could also staple your  junk to a 2x4 too with almost the same effect :P 

If it turns out there are no weakness's in this game, it's fully balanced, stays fun and has enough depth to also stay desirable rating could rise. Will probably come down to what kind of legs it has, after about 6 - 8 plays I'll know but I dont see it dropping under 9, nice to have another one of those around

Involving theme. Beautiful board.

A few too many things going on.

Rules, concepts, actions, cards overload for first play.

This was just O.K. for me.  I get it - I see the way everything interacts, I see the way the mechanics keep it tight all the way until the end, the theme is spot-on, etc.

But I just didn't LIKE it.  Maybe there's too much going on.  Maybe our group wasn't very good.  (I know we weren't bribing as much as we should have been, for example.)  This should have been right in my wheelhouse, but it didn't click.  I'll give it another go at some point, but count me as underwhelmed.

Power Struggle is a reworking of Tribune with a more interesting theme and additional complexity.  I only wish it didn't end so quickly.  The game feels to me like it wants to be 6-7 turns and instead we ended on Turn 4.  A bit of a shame.  The bribery is fantastic.

Still it's a good sign that at the end of the game what I didn't like about it was that I didn't get to play more.  The nemesis goal should help replayability.  This is a strong 8 for me - I don't see any likelihood of it dropping below 8, but it could rise to 9.

In Power Struggle, players are power brokers in a major corporation trying to gain influence, buy up shares, control departments and divisions, place people on the board of directors, and generally act like the corrupt a-holes they are. You can gain influence by firing employees, bribing other division heads to use their special privileges, canning your division heads and re-hiring them as pricey consultants, using the accounting department to get a discount on company shares and so on. The rules to this one are intimidating at first blush, but the game flows smoothly once you get them down. Power Struggle gives you 5 separate point tracks and when it is your turn 7 possible actions, most with at least two variations. That's a lot of options and a lot of paths to victory. The first player to achieve 4 of 6 possible victory conditions wins.

Each turn is divided into two halves: the directors' meeting and the department turns. The director's meeting is mostly maintenance, realigning the division heads and the makeup of the board that resulted from the previous turn's actions and getting the points and privileges associated with the realignment. The department turns go in a cycle of event - actions - event - actions, until another director's meeting is announced. The head of the communications division orders the events and determines exactly how many department turns there will be (between 4 and 7). Half the game board shows the 6 divisions and the various department rooms that make up those divisions. A player controls a division if they have a majority of department heads within it. Controlling a division accords certain privileges (such as controlling events, getting shares more cheaply, hiring more efficiently, and so on). Using the privileges smartly seems to be one of the main keys to the game. Players can also bribe privileges away from other players (passing offers secretly in "bribe folders"), not only gaining the privilege but making it more powerful to boot.  There are 5 point tracks on the board. Once you reach a certain level on each track, you have met that victory condition. The tracks are:

Influence (gained by being chairman, by having board members (which are promoted from division heads), and by firing employees)
Shares (purchased in blocks - the blocks are limited so that not everyone can meet this victory condition)
Main Departments (regular departments can be combined into main departments)
Corruption (1 point every turn you offer a bribe and 1 point for the player who accepts a bribe)
Counsel (fired division heads can become outside consultants for that division, or consultants can be purchased for 2 million each)

The 6th victory condition comes from beating another player head-to-head. Every player is dealt an archenemy card (a player's color) and another card that lists 3 tracks you must beat the other player at to meet the condition.

The economic and majority mechanics mix together nicely in unique ways, but I think what makes this game feel different, really different, are the victory conditions. Usually in these sorts of games you have complete companies competing against each other which, despite different paths to achieve the end, the end is usually boils down to a single victory point track or money. This game brilliantly takes into account all the various ways in which one can advance their own interests within a company and gives credit for each of them individually. It sounds like your typical "balanced development" requirement in many games, but it doesn't feel like it. Each condition is achieved in very different ways and you have to ignore some to advance in the ones that align with your strategy. It almost feels like 5 mini games are intertwined and being played simultaneously with a strong connective theme and numerous touch points. VERY thematic for this style of game. I can't say I've played a game like it.

Power Struggle has a great sense of humor, and that's rare to see in a game. You have to admire a game in which you can be your own arch-enemy - perfectionism gone wrong? Twisted narcissism?

Players maneuver around several cross-currents trying to worm their way to the top of a corporation. To win, you must meet four of the six victory conditions. There are several divisions of the company, and players may hire employees and form departments within these divisions in order to access special privileges. But here's the catch: you actually don't want to take power in a division that is crucial to your own plans. Instead, you want to take power in a division that someone else needs, because they will bribe you to access its privilege, which then becomes more powerful. One of the more enjoyable elements of Power Struggle is that there are ways to make money, but it's not a game explicitly about generating and accumulating cash. Money is a means to an end, not the end itself. Refreshing.

Power Struggle owes a lot to Tribune: Primus Inter Pares, which also blends a wide range of mechanics and features a set of victory conditions. Tribune is a faster, slicker game. Power Struggle is more amusing and perhaps meatier. Certainly the actual mechanics involved in both games are distinct from one another, even if the overall style makes them close cousins. I'm not sure which I prefer, and would probably recommend choosing between them based purely on theme. Be warned that both games rub some players the wrong way because the game ends suddenly when one player declares victory, with everyone else moments away from their own anticipated triumphs.

[Update: February 2011] After 5 plays, I'm of two minds when it comes to Power Struggle. I love the dark sense of humor and all the different possibilities the system seems to present. However, in our group the game is over in 10-13 actions. I think it's just that, overall, we suck at it. Only one or two players have really figured it out. So at this point, every time we play, you have a good chunk of the table that is trying to get a feel for how everything works, and before they've done more than dip their toes in the water, someone else has won the game. When I take a step back and survey the situation, it seems to me that bribing is the mechanic that ties the game together, and so far players persist in being really bad at it. I wouldn't say I'm great at it, myself. 

I want to love Power Struggle, but plays are quickly taking on a "throwaway" feeling. Toss another 90 minutes in the garbage as most of us fumble around.

Finally! An office game worth playing. This combination gets an extra rating point. Well-known elements as area control or action selection are combined with less used mechanisms as bribing other players and innovations as archenemies (also other players) in combination with secret targets. I'm only worried a bit about the main departments cluttering the divisions which reduces opportunities in the endgame. But this might be specific to our game group.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Based on one play, I think this is a cool game.  When push comes to shove, its basically area placement, and the theme is neat, you have an arch-enemy, and there is humor involved.  Good game!

I originally liked this quite a bit  even though we were misplaying a few things due to a classic hurried Essen rules explanation. For once this kind of influence / area control mechanism actually makes thematic sense, likewise for variable player powers. I also love the mechanism of just one player knowing when the round ends. All in all a very solid game that somehow manages to feel fresh despite the generic eurogame ingredients.

After replaying several times with the correct rules like it even more. Game moved surprisingly quickly even 5p with 3 newbies. With 5 players who all had at least one game of experience, we can constantly finish the game in 90 minutes, which is a lot faster than you would've expected from the bgg game description.

I like the theme, since it is fairly unique.  I'm not sure how well it's implemented, as it's evident that this is really just a cube-pushing game.

I like the archenemy element, but there is a little balance problem there, as if you overlap in two areas it is harder to score that victory point than if you only overlap in one area.

I also enjoy the bribing aspect, since you can legitimately acquire some good powers as the briber, and earn some good money as the bribee.  I like how you can also perform bribes that you know will be rejected just to increase your corruption.  Finally I like how you can finish a bribe and then turn around and stab the person that gave you the money by retiring your department head.

As long as everyone knows the rules, the game plays fairly quickly.  So overall I have a pretty good time playing this game.

Based on one play: surprised how little I liked this given how much I love Tribune. The area control part is nothing special, and the Tribune multiple tracks to victory was done better in Tribune. So what really pushes the game's uniqueness is the bribery aspect.

Unfortunately I just didn't find that particularly interesting. Makes for a fine game, but not one that I need to jump on. Oh well...

This is very enjoyable, particularly with a group who enjoy bribing and backstabbing - matches the deeply cynical theme of the game perfectly.

This looks like an area control game for the first couple of plays, and then you realise that it really isn't. Plays very fast with experienced players, with victory by the third board meeting, and occasionally even the second. Whether the game is quite as interesting once I play a few more times with experienced players remains to be seen, but I hope it is!

Power Struggle is missing the excitement AND that's the biggest issue here. It works how it works (=it's not broken)... but there aren't any (meaningful) surprise elements. You just do couple of prepare movements first and then to the goal AND all that you do the way that every other player sees what are you planning for. It's just that, who is the fastest... no real competition etc. The first Power Struggle game can take quite a while (our game took ~100 min.), but the later ones are much much faster (easily under 80 min.), so the problem is not the length, just that it isn't fun.

Lots of neat and original ideas in this high-learning-curve Euro-style worker placement game. The VP system takes a while to get the hang of, but makes perfect sense once you've played a few rounds. Some of the mechanics - esp. bribery, influence, and the way that executive positions circulate from round to round - are truly novel and ingenious. Compared to similarly difficult Euros like Agricola and Khronos, it had a bit less theme and flavor, but that's not really the fault of the design so much as it is of the fact that corporate culture is just a bit less essentially interesting than medieval farming and time travel. Reagrdless of this quibble, though, every fan of the genre really does need to try this one out.

Area-control with a twist of corporate-themed screwage.  Our first game started out with a lot of fumbling around trying to understand how to gain points in the various areas, but once we played a couple turns and a couple players had a few victory points in the bag, it started to get interesting/tense as no one really knew who was on the verge of beating their arch-rival.  Look forward to future plays.

Cuento corto: me quedé con un gustillo a El Grande, juego que ya vendí, porque la mecánica de mayorías simplemente me aburrió (salvo en el caso de San Marco).



Ayer lo jugué con 5 personas, todos primerizos. Reglas explicadas en 50 minutos; partida de unas dos horas y media de duración, aunque se intuye que con mas experiencia perfectamente se termina en 90 minutos

Uno de los jugadores no le impresionó tanto; decía: me gusta mas Le Havre; o Age of Steam. Otro se acordó que le gusta mucho Age of Empires III. O sea, ningún WOW.

Yo me quedé un poco decepcionado, particularmente porque muchas reseñas decían que lo de mayorías tenía un giro distinto al normal, o que estaba oculto. A mi se me apareció muy clara esa mecánica. Ahora, no es como El Grande que todo es mayoría, pero como es un sistema que no me convence, hmmm, que se me atraviesa (como se me atravesó en Confucius), hace que todo quede empañado.

Sin embargo, intuyo que mi valoración sólo podría mejorar (por lo menos por las siguientes partidas...luego, quien sabe). Eso, porque las otras mecánicas, como la del soborno que se hace a otro jugador para obtener un poder especial, son interesantes.


En pleno soborno...parte del juego muy entretenida, aunque al final de la partida ya nadie aceptaba sobornos.

Los componentes de juego son TOP, aunque el tablero es un poco grande, porque el área del Consejo de Administración y Presidente del mismo está un poco excedida.

Volviendo a lo de juego de mayorías, lo que me molesta es que, como en El Grande o Liberté, hay un cierto caos: no sabes en qué momento a otro jugador se le ocurre atacar la misma área que te interesa, desbaratando todo plan; o simplemente, usando un poder especial, te elimina fichas del tablero de juego (de hecho yo utilicé una facultad para, en tres acciones de turnos distintos, eliminar hasta 9 fichas enemigas...mis compañeros ya me odiaban...y subyacentemente odiaban un poquitito al juego). En efecto, no tiene la tranquilidad de planificación de, por ejemplo, Phoenicia (nuestro anterior juego de moda, donde la interacción estaba solo en las subastas). O sea, si recordábamos lo que hacíamos las semanas pasadas con Phoenicia, en Power Struggle las zancadillas son más directas, lo que molesta a jugadores que prefieren juegos como el señalado Phoenicia, o Caylus, o Le Havre. Además, tampoco tienes la sensación de ir logrando algo concreto, desarrollando tu ciudad o tu área de juego.

En cuanto a estrategias, debo reconocer que hace tiempo no andaba tan perdido con la variedad de posibilidades en tu turno (7 tipos de acciones, cada una de las cuales pudiendo desarrollarse en muchos sectores del tablero). Pero eso mismo demuestra que no es simple el juego y que, espero, depare sorpresas agradables, cuando logremos tener claridad en las estrategias/tácticas.

En esta partida, nuestro jugador más ganador, César, salió último...no logró meta alguna de las 4 mínimas para ganar (recordemos que hay 6 posibles metas, de las cuales el que logra 4 gatilla el fin de la partida y gana, salvo que haya empate en metas, caso en el cual decide el dinero).

Ely fue la ganadora, con 4 metas cumplidas, incluida la derrota del archienemigo en las tres competencias, que precisamente fue César. A distancia quedé yo con 2 metas cumplidas. Tercero Carlos con 1 meta cumplida y alrededor de 2 millones en dinero; cuarto Francisco con 1 meta y alrededor de 1 millón. Ultimo César sin metas cumplidas, pero muy cerca de lograr varias (al parecer su diversificación atentó contra su objetivo...como que se le acabó el juego antes de tiempo, y eso que duró más de dos horas).

El jueves 4 de diciembre de 2009 es nuestra segunda partida y haré los comentarios respectivos, para ver si hay evolución o involución.

ACTUALIZACIÓN: tras 4 partidas ratifico que es un juego de mayorías, no solo en la lucha en ciertos sectores obvios del tablero, como los departamentos, sino que incluso en una de las metas que pueden intentar los jugadores, y que en general intentan, cual es la derrota del archienemigo. Para lograrlo, la pista respectiva es como un nuevo juego de mayorías.

Bueno, y como los juegos de mayorías ya me tienen más que aburridos, califico provisoriamente a Power Struggle con un 6

One play so far. Lots of options and many cool mechanics. I like being able to bribe other players. I also like how taking over various departments rewards department heads with variable powers, such as the director of communications controlling the order of certain events, etc. Plays relatively quickly for a game this deep. Rating will probably go up with more plays.

Update: Played a few more times. Still great, definitely not a gateway. Don't get to play this enough.

An obvious comparison for Power $truggle is In the Shadow of the Emperor. Even though I'm going to rate the two the same, I do think the latter is the better game; I've just played it out for now, whereas Power $truggle is still fairly new to me. In both, you're trying to temporarily control areas that grant special privileges and give you a minor boost when ousted, but where In the Shadow of the Emperor comes together at the end of every round with the election of the Emperor, Power $truggle feels more disparate, like tinkering with the innards of a watch without getting to know what time it is. Or watching snippets from a movie out of order and without seeing the ending. Or something. Granted, there's a similar election in Power $truggle (for the Board Chair), but this position isn't nearly as powerful as the Emperor, and it's far easier to replace the current Chair. With In the Shadow of the Emperor, this is a tense battle every round of the game; even if you're not going for it yourself, you still have to pay attention to it, unless you want to lose the game.

That said, there's still plenty to like about Power $truggle. It's a luckless area control game with some subtle semi-cooperative aspects. The theme humorously comes through in nearly every aspect of the game. The Bribery mechanism is unique, and the whole economy of the game is something I've yet to figure out (if there is, in fact, really anything to figure out). Once you've played a couple times with the same players, you'll all know the rules and be playing more efficiently, allowing games to fly by in just an hour or so, which is about as good as it gets for a game this complex.

But getting to that level of familiarity is quite a challenge and is my other main complaint with this game. With six different victory tracks, around twenty different actions a player can take on his turn, three multi-step procedural events, and fourteen privileges, you're signing up for a solid 30 minutes (20 if you're really good) of rules explanation. (I've found that putting stickies next to the victory tracks indicating how you can improve on each of them helps with the clarity of the explanation, but not necessarily the length.) Even after you've gone through everything, players will be slowed by the sheer overhead of weighing all their options, and initial games will probably be around two hours, starting to push into "too long for what it is" territory. But if you can overcome this initial investment and get the same group playing this game more than once, it could be a worth endeavor.

One final note: After a couple plays, everyone has their favorite claim to how the game is "unbalanced." I've heard/read them all and have probably thought them at one point or another myself: Influence is too easy, Shares are too strong, Main Departments are definitely the easiest, Corruption is too hard, Counsel is the easiest. All of these and none of these are true: it really varies by the setup and the group. When I've tested this on my own, I never got into shoving people off the board, so Influence seems better than Counsel, since board members get paid while consultants don't. But then when I actually played with other players, board members were getting kicked off through out the game, making Influence a riskier proposition. I also agree that [thread=487547]Corruption looks difficult on paper[/thread], but with the right group you'll be flying up that track faster than any other.

The game had much more meat to it than the box shows  The first few turns I wasn't very sure of what to do because I wasn't aware of what would be more valuable to me or to the others at that point...

But with the turns going by I started to get it and be able to plan some moves...

The game is pretty darn cool... the interaction between the players is awesome... the bribe action is great...and the Arch-enemy feature is super-awesome!!
Really liked the game and hope to play it again in the future.

Power Struggle attempts to abstract the corporate grind, but only succeeds in abstracting, which bears little resemblance to reality . . . this is NOT how corporations work . . . besides, it is too "complex" (or unclear in the rules) for what you get . . .

Mon principal problème est que je regroupe rarement cinq joueurs autour d'une table, et je possède trois jeux exigeant d'être cinq joueurs que j'aime beaucoup: Power Struggle, Amun-Re et Santiago.

J'ai vraiment hâte d'y rejouer! Toutefois, je n'ai pas hâte d'avoir à l'expliquer à des joueurs n'y ayant jamais joué! Les règles sont quelque peu complexes au premier coup d'oeil. Aussi, elles sont mal conçues, notamment parce qu'elles sont répétitives.

The theme is interesting, and the concept is neat. I also like the fact that you are racing to get what you need while the goals are different among players. The options are overwhelming though, and the bribery part doesn't make much sense. With some rules simplification and adjustment it can easily becomes a much better game.

RATING: 1.5
A boring, loose, tedious, broken, repetitive and unfinished prototype of a game without tension. It forces players to do illogical or meaningless things for what seems like eternity, to achieve little more than slow advances on bland-looking tracks. It seems like a thematic (but torturous) inside joke to make a game laughing at the boring and repetitive nature of corporate life. The secret objectives/rivals play no real part in any proceedings, and the game has no hook or variation. There is a deck of cards full of similar/identical cards with merely different 'funny' flavour texts. The humour does not come from gameplay, nor does it resonate with the experience. Players offer meaningless bribes to each other for little more reason than to advance on a corruption track, and the penalty for not accepting a bribe is small and meaningless. This leads to turns and rounds of nothing happening. One struggles to care how much of (terrible-looking paper money) currency one has, since money has no interesting uses. The whole ordeal of bribing produces a few chuckles at best. Possibly my worst experience in board gaming. There are some decent mechanical ideas here, unpolished as they might be, but there is NO game. For a good track-based tight worker placement with many options and tension, look to Bruxelles 1893 instead. Power Struggle tries to be a joke, but well, it just ends up being a joke. Paradoxical.

This is a game that mimics the office environment. There are 6 departments (HR, communicatons, development, etc) that report to a board of directors and a chairman. Players are attempting to buy shares, create departments, hire employees (denoted by gray nondescript cubes) and bribe people. There are 5 VP tracks: Influence, Shares, Main Departments, Corruption and Consultants. Everytime you do something in the game, you will likely be progressing up these tracks. Each of these tracks has a point you have to reach to able to score 1 pt. The person who can score 4 VPs can declare an end to the game. However, everyone also has an "archenemy card", where if you beat the opponent in three of the categories, you get an other VP. It's actually got a nice theme, and the event cards are kind of funny, since they always lower morale, and when morale is low, heads of department get more effective use of their powers. 

The departments play sort of like an area control. Whoever has the most gets to be department head, and they get a special power. The department head can then be pushed up to the board of directors or hired as a consultant. 

The only part of the game I don't like is the bribes. You slip someone some cash in exchange for their department head power. If they accept, both of you go up one in corruption, and you get their department head power. If they don't accept, you get nothing. Thanks for coming out. 

Each round, there are a number of event cards. Play an event card, then everyone gets to play an action. Next event card, then actions. In between is a payout for shares, and the round ends with the election of board of directors card. 

I would be willing to give this game another try to see the various strategies. My initial ranking would be a 6.5, since I'm not fond of the bribing mechanic.

A fantastic euro set in the world of a corporation in which you win by offering bribes to department heads, out-competing a fellow C-suite member, and firing employees to gain influence, among less odious actions as joining the firm's counsel, buying stock, and promoting two managers in a vertical to a main department. Some mutual exclusivity between engine-building and point scoring means it'll take a play to understand winning strategy. There is also a unique mechanic in that one player (who has area of control over the marketing department) determines how many actions each person takes per round. Great stuff.

RATING: N/A
Bought this game -- I kid you not -- 12 hours before I was told that my management position would be eliminated.  Six months later, I discovered my position was eliminated in order for the VP to raid the funds from my department in order to hire more people in her own.  Six months after THAT, I walked two of my own team members through THEIR round of layoffs.

There's certain themes that some people find so patently offensive, they'll refuse to play it.  This game is mine.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
There's a mean balance between the role cards: The departments get hit a lot by the Development role and bribery actions. So, you need the Human Resources role to counteract that, and you also have to take bribery actions yourself in order to grab the roles without using departments. And the other roles are not any less important either!

The theming has been done very cleverly: The theme fits the mechanics perfectly, as do the card texts and graphic design.

The English rules are a mess, so stick to the original German rules.

The theme of this game is fun.  First game was with a bunch of first timers, so I am sure we did not hit the depth of this game.  There are so few actions, and usually at least a few of them are very enticing.  The bribing and arch-nemesis made the game for me, somewhat diverging the road to winning among players.

RATING: 7
You're using actions to get your managers onto the board in an area majority manner to firstly get hold of powers and then eventually give up those majorities and powers in order to move up the VP tracks. The aim is Tribune like - to be the first to reach the VP level on 4 of the 5 tracks, or on 3 tracks and be ahead of the player secretly assigned to be your enemy in each of those tracks. Each action you take is small but needs to be part of a designed strategy, aimed at taking advantage of complementary powers, to gain a leading edge. Thought is required. There's a bunch of fun on offer in the offering and taking of bribes (in order to gain ramped up powers). It's a bit of work to learn with so many action types and powers available. There's not a lot of tension ... the game is more about manouvering your managers here then there as your strategy dictates and as opportunities for easy wins arrive. The board manager theme is livened up by the corruption spin and boosted by the event cards flavour text. Very Euro, but with some fun included.

2 plays - terribly conceived rulebook, but once you've figured it out, this is surprisingly fun. You can directly 'hurt' other players, by removing their staff from various parts of the board, so you will need to be okay with that kind of game. However, I feel this strikes a good balance between chasing your own goals and player interaction. Ultimately, causing trouble for someone else is best done when it serves your greater purpose/ strategy, which is what games like this should be aiming to achieve (but don't always). 

The Dept. head tiles/ abilities are good, but could have been streamlined. I say this, because the abilities are only really viewable by those that possess them and like many games that do this, player aids would have really helped. 

The tracks you're trying to climb in the game (that ultimately will give you victory) all work fairly uniquely, which is not always the case for many games that use them. I think overall, this is quite fun with a satirical feel to it's own theme.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
There are six points available for each player, but once you get four, you win. Climb up different ladders and try to be ahead of your enemy, but you must reach a minimum level on each ladder in order to achieve a victory point. Others can see who is in the lead on each ladder and will fight you as you reach the top. To get points you battle for majority in different areas, which give you abilities, you bribe others and you get nominated to be the boss. Seems a little daunting at first, but plays very smoothly. I would say it is a must try.

Un tema originale e cinico ben rappresentato da meccaniche non banali. Un sacco di cose da fare e molti obiettivi da raggiungere con poche azioni a disposizione. Molto interessanti e ben resi i poteri dei dirigenti: la scelta della sequenza delle carte, da parte del capo della comunicazione, è a mio parere la più importante (troppo? Una sola partita è poco per stabilirlo). Nel suo complesso, il meccanismo sembra molto ben oliato. L'unica sensazione poco positiva è l'eccessivo caos a seguito di ogni azione dei giocatori, che rende molto difficile impostare una strategia chiara. Forse con un minor numero di giocatori questo aspetto si sente meno. Si presenta benissimo, con materiali buoni e grafica estremamente carina (non a caso, opera di Lars Arne "Maura" Kaluski, il padre delle illustrazioni di Funny Friends). [tengo basso il voto promettendomi di rivederlo dopo una partita completa]

Okay, so I didn't particularly enjoy this game with two players (which it admittedly isn't designed for anyway.) It felt like a lot of sitting around, counting money and waiting to take your one action... rinse, repeat. The thing is with more players, there will be additional waiting around. 

The mechanics really fit the business theme well.... but I guess I just found the business theme kind of boring!

I'm willing to try with more than two, but I think this is one of those Tanga impulse buys that will end up on the trade shelf.

Very nice and beautiful euro-style game !!

It's a very thematic game where you're trying to run a corporation by making the best moves as possible.

The game is not as dull as it first seems by reading the rulebook for the first time, because after the first few rounds, the theme starts to come alive with all the great humour on the cards and all the interesting possible actions to outsmart your opponents, such as corruption, hiring or kicking out your employees, etc.

To win in this game, you need to think like a shark and a greedy corporate CEO. Fortunately, it's just a game and we are actually having fun by making some very evil decisions. Soft hearted people be aware !!

Overall, this game is extremely deep in strategies, lots of options to explore, great theme, hilarious humours, tough choices, variable characters powers, a clever corruption mechanism and beautiful components.

This is a gamer's game indeed. Absolute perfection !

Feels like a game that was built around its theme rather than having the theme bolted on to generic cube-pushing mechanics. There are lots of moving parts and some really interesting twists on area majority that I didn't appreciate until I'd already lost the game. Firstly, losing a majority can be just as important as gaining one; and secondly, you usually don't want to control the things you actually need, you want to control the things other people need so they will pay to take them away from you. The rules explanation took a while and I was worried that I was going to hate it, but once we got going it moved really quickly, with little downtime, and a 5p game with 4 newbies was all over in 90 minutes. 

UPDATE played again the following week and was able to make a plan based on my goal card and execute it well. Great game, moved up to an 8.

Many people despise me for that philosophy but happily state it again. I like my euros simple and my ameritrash complex. This falls right into the wrong puddle of mud. Way too complex and dry for my taste. There is also not enough interaction. I am not saying there is none, but the game did not facilitate the kind of discussions and planning or banter I would expect from game that attempts to emulate the ongoings in a company like this. Id rather struggle with decisions because the strategic implications are hard to figure out instead of the mechanics itself. Not my cup of tea.

RATING: 5
Yet another area majority game. However, it has (or rather lacks) certain features that I find refreshing:

* No worker placement mechanic!
* Free placement of your influence tokens (your typical area majority game restricts where you could place them)
* You only perform one action on your turn!

Despite some BGG comments and the 16 page rule booklet, the game is quite straightforward to explain. It's an area majority game in which you're awarded a special power for your majorities. There are five scoring tracks on which you gain points for doing specific things during the game:

Influence: For having meeples in the board of directors or the chairman's position

Shares: For simply buying shares (money is only spent on shares and bribes)

Head Departments: For consolidating two of the "spaces" you own into one space (each "area" consists of six spaces).

Corruption: You may bribe your opponents to take their special power away from them. You get points for doing so

Consul/Experience: If you lose a majority in an area, or choose to abandon an area, you can get a point.

If you get a certain amount of points on a scoring track, you get 1VP. First player to 4VP wins. (Another refreshing change: simple to calculate winning conditions.)

There's a sixth way to get a VP: You receive a hidden objective at the beginning of the game. If you have more points in the specified categories than one specified opponent (your "archenemy"), then you get one more VP. This can potentially unbalancing: Because you have a limited number of actions to perform, it's hard to focus on all five scoring tracks. So if your archenemy is ignoring the categories that you have to beat, then you have a relatively easy win.

There's one thing that annoys me about the current crop of Euros. A lot of them make me feel that I'm playing on an Excel spreadsheet: Which column -- I mean category -- should I focus on? This is no exception. Although the calculation of a score is much simpler than comparable Euros, you're still simply competing with other players on different scoring tracks.

One BGG comment mentioned that there is no luck in this game. This isn't true: one player (who has won the majority in a specific area) gets to decide how many actions may be performed by the players during each turn, and when players receive money as well as when other special events occur. These special events are random. If you differentiate luck with perfect information, the imperfect information comes from the rest of the players not knowing when the action phase ends and the amounts players bribe each other.

On a related point, this is [i]not[/i] a negotiation game.

Power Struggle seems like it needs quite a few players. I played with five and that seemed like a really good number. So the basic premise of the game is that you are board member in this really evil company. You want a very inefficient company where you have a lot of employees in your division because the more employees you have, the more power you have in the company. There are a bunch of different divisions that the different players can be in control of: legal, communications, development, accounting, human resources, etc. Each division has a different special power that you get when you are in control of it, for instance Human Resources lets you have an extra employee whenever you hire new employees; Communications lets you establish the deck and determine how much the employees will be motivated (or demotivated as the case usually is). Each division can also be bribed and if you buy a special power from someone through bribing the special power gets a bonus. 

The goal for the game is to be better than you arch-nemesis in three categories randomly assigned at the beginning of the game. If you do that, you get 1 VP. You also get 1 VP for doing well in a bunch of categories such as bribing people a lot, buying a lot of shares in the company, etc.

I enjoyed the game even though I think it's got a learning curve.  I also really love the art style.  It's a game that I would buy for the classic 70's style artwork.

I won't rate this game after just the one play. I am told it's way better with 5 players than with 3. It feels a bit like El Grande to me, in the sense that you are taking actions with (usually) small effects in order to maneuver for dominance in a number of different areas. But the differences are greater than the similarities: the areas of dominance are of varying kinds, and there is a potentially high level of player interaction in the "bribe" mechanism (although in my one game, bribing wasn't used much).

A game of Office. You play as an important member of a large company, taking charge of a certain department, hiring and sacking employees, being elected as Board Chairman, buying stocks from the Company and bribing other contestants etc. Very ironical and a little sense of black humour. The theme is impressive but the mechanics contain so much fiddleness. A new player usually finds it hard to remember all of the rules, and thus fails to figure out a strategy. And the foreign company background is slightly different from our country as well.

From reading the rules, this sounds like a potentially delightful mix of euro 'worker placement' with a pinch of take-that gameplay. Add to that the rather low victory point threshold and bribing and it's beginning to sound good. Unfortunately though, there seems to be quite a bit to take in ruleswise, which might make for slow, ponderous first plays if not plays in general. Kind of wanting to play, but definitely not wanting to own...

A thematic mix between Tribune and Struggle for the Emperor. A hidden objective for each player adds a bit of mystery to the mix, but for the most part the victory goals are there for all to see. Players can choose from a variety of different special actions each round, and the timing of these actions can provide extra benefits or lead to a opportunity missed inefficiency. All up there's a wealth of choice and the game runs in at a little over an hour for experienced players. Good stuff for a seemingly dry theme. I'm interested in exploring this one further.

Wow!  These rules are bad!  They don't define key elements when they need to be defined, and they fail to clearly convey VERY important parts of a game - e.g. turning over your privilege tile when you use it (and which ones?).  We had to restart twice!

Well, on to the game, it is a great little system.  For how complex the overhead is to learning this, the game actually is pretty simple.  This game offers many fun decisions and really pits players against each other directly (a real relief in the new era of drafting and parallel play). 

Thematically everything works.  There is an acerbic wit to the game that is quite enjoyable. 

I'd be tempted to give this a higher rating but I have issues with the secret archenemies and secret goals.  In many games with this level of interactivity there is a sense of common courtesy where the first place player will try to better their position, but will also try to hold the second place player back, and all others will try to work their way up.  But if you archenemy is the last place player you are going to do you best to keep them crushed down to insure that you get an extra point. It is awkward.  

If you draw your own card it gives you a distinct advantage, for multiple reasons.  One, it means that you are not a target -- play will be based solely on someone's best positional interest rather than someone hobbling you. 

Two, stocks are finite and are substantially good with or without an agenda. If you have stocks as a secret agenda you are competing against all other players to move up.  It is very possible to not only get closed out with no way to beat your opponent, but to also the objective encouraged you to invest in it, and you may also get closed out of the green point by people that are buying stocks just because they are good.  That can be a two point swing (out of four) because of the incentivized caprice  of the other players.  Compare this to the other tracks where there is always a chance to move up on them.  If you pull your own character if one of your agendas is stocks you can choose not to pursue it and still get a point. 

The other thing about stocks is that when everyone is racing for them, few people are spending their money on bribes.  The bribes are the heart of the game.  If players have the option to not go for stocks then they can manipulate their strategy to give the stock racers money and get the bribed roles easier. If not there is such a heavy disincentive that the bribes aren't worth it.

I really like the game, but I think that the secret archenemies are so problematic that I think that from here on out I will only play this with the agenda set as if you get your own card.  

I also don't encourage playing this with three players.  It works, but I think it is a better game with more.

UPDATE: Played with 5 with your own worst enemy rules and it was great (although I liked it far more than anyone at the table)  With a full compliment and the adjustment to the secret enemies I give this an 8.5.

There is a lot going on--this rating might improve. It felt very similar in spirit to Tribune (but better!) for me--lots of interweaving mechanisms driven by area majority, and a choice of what victory conditions to shoot for.

Power Struggle is a very good game, but I'm not sure I'll play enough to make it a fun game. There were moments of fun in my one play but there was also a lot of work. That work, I'm sure, would become more second nature and intuitive with further playings.

The cynical theme reminds me of Greed, Inc., although it's not quite as heave here.  It's enough to interfere with my enjoyment of the game though, trying to move up the corruption scoring track for example.  Besides that, the somewhat fiddly gameplay just didn't capture my interest.  Add in a long rulebook and it's just not to my tastes, but that's at least partially attributable to my own quirks and biases, so others may enjoy it more.

I really, really enjoy this game. It's very well designed with all its aspects very well combined with solid and in certain aspects new mechanics. I like economic themed games but this one also comprises some kind of bureaucracy theme with it which I found cute and at the same time refreshing. 

The theme is well implemented and when players get the feeling of the game it all makes sense. If players push the right buttons this game can actually be lots of fun.

This one could be one of the most interesting games of this year.

Here's my Portuguese review: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/461143

I really, really like this game. Played it again with four players it improved. The way bribes work is pure fun. A great game. I don't like one of the cards of the game - it's too much chaotic when compared to the rest of the cards, but it's just a minor flaw IMO that can easily be solved by playing without that card (I'm referring to the card that dismisses the Chairman...)

This game is often very hard to explain to first-timers as the sheer amount of options they are allowed to do are confusing. When you do finally learn how to play it, you will realize the amount of options you can actually do are extremely limited (meaning everyone will be performing the same [similar] actions over and over until the game ends). Whoever owns the communications power is quite powerful though as they can completely control the flow of the game (and make the powers of certain other departments completely useless).

Not a fun game within a casual crowd. If you are with people who work in an office environment similar to the game or are playing literally in an office in a corporation/ firm, then this game will have more "fun" value for you.

A fantastic but opaque game. The mechanics seem to point you somewhere but actually a lot of the control you feel you want to exert is misplaced, actually letting go and moving on is better play - which meshes very well with the cynical and humorous theme. It really needs repeat plays to get to grips with which is difficult to achieve.

You need a game to absorb the rules and learn the strategies. All the powers and actions are not equivalent and some need to be pursued early while others in late game.

The game comes down to forcing others out of their strategy and capitalizing on their tactical choice.

[Zman 10 edition] {Corporation; area control, bride; optimal 4p} it is a tense and fun game. It is full of player interactions and it is thematic - full of ambushes.

It is difficult to teach this game as there are many avaialble options and many privileges.  And it needs a few games to master the victory paths, power of each department and strategies.

The error the bonus card is very annoying.

RATING: 7.3
There is a lot of game there and it's pretty good too. The morale cards have great flavour text and everything ties together surprisingly thematically.

My main problems with it are how much harder it is on newbies and tied to that, if your rival is doing badly then it is surely easier for you which could imbalance the game.

Update: It *is* a good game, but the turns can run a little long as there are so many options. The point you can score for beating your rival is very dependant on how good your rival is at the game and so playing with newbies does imbalance everything.

Even with this it's a good game, but just not quite a great game.

Rating down from 7.6 to 7.3.

The game is different from other games. On the main board you try to have majarity in the departaments, but be the head of a departament don`t give you points. You become points for influence (discarding cubes, that you need to be in a departament), shares (you need money), main departaments (you need departaments to make a main departament) and experience (when you lose a departament, that you control, you could put the ex departament head on the experience track). 

You can have point for corruption (when you try to corrupt, or somone corrupts you). With corruption you can buy someone`s card that he has for a departament - the departament head loses the ability and you become the bribbed ability (better than the standard). 

The most important departament is controling - you choice how many phases will be in a round. Only you will know how many time you have in a round and what event come  (you can change the order of the events).

That all is good, what i don`t like is the archenemy. You can have 5 points and the 6th when you are better than you archenemy in 2 of 3 categories. The problem is when your archenemy has different goals, than it`s very easy for you to make the point. Better is the version where every other player is your archenemy (you must be better than all other players in 2 of 3 categories.

Like so many games with a corporate workplace theme, this game feels like ... work. Power Struggle feels a bit like someone tried to turn Kremlin into a Euro game, but somehow all the fun and humor got sucked out of it in the process.

I have no idea why I wrote such a long explanation of why I like this game.

I am always happy when a game takes a well-known mechanic and completely flips it on its head, and allows the player to experience it in a new and original way.  The bribing mechanism in this game is one such instance.  We've all played games with variable player powers.  But what about games with variable variable-player-powers!?  That's what Power Struggle has.  And the way they work in this game are just clever enough to be fresh and original.  Bribing essentially "activates" a more powerful version of a player power, and these are constantly changing hands, sometimes by force and sometimes because you want to accept bribes (or suffer the consequences of not accepting one at all).  Or if you position yourself correctly, you can accept the bribe, thereby giving away your power, and then resigning next turn and disabling the power altogether!  Fun jerkishness achieved!

Overall, this game is great.  I will suggest it and gladly play it at any opportunity.

This is a glorious game. The art is fantastic. The game is simple but the explanation of the rules can be lengthy. Very innovative and refreshing "area control" game.

This is not a game for everyone, but if you like games like Goa, Caylus, and Big Kini, then buy your copy now!

RATING: 5
Tanga. Very strange game. Area majority to fight over some perks, but it's ultimately a race game to advance on five tracks. The secret goal cards are a godsend, without which I would have no clue which tracks I should focus on.

What is so strange to me about this game, is how unimpeded I felt by the other players. They can mainly stop your progress on the "corruption" track by refusing your bribes (which hurts both of you). But if you want shares, you just buy them. You want influence, you fire employees or pack the board of directors. Main departments, just merge ordinary departments, or buy one. Counsel positions, either resign as division head or buy it. These transactions feel very direct.

In my first game, FOUR of the five players attained the goal score in the same round, requiring a money tiebreaker.

I guess without the secret goals, there would be a risk of too many players going after the same thing. Especially influence and shares cannot be stockpiled by everybody. But the goals basically inherently spread the players out so that there is not likely to be congestion.

Why does the Communication head have to bother with creating an event deck for the round? Since most events are just motivation decreases (another thing whose presence in the game I'm not sure I get) it has little purpose but to make round length variable.

It just seems like there is so much needless stuff for what you get. The area majority struggle and the bribery should've been more important. You could probably accomplish both merely by giving the division heads more crucial abilities.

The feel of rising through the ranks (getting more points) is there, and there are many things to attempt to excel in, by doing various business-related (at least in name) actions. Efficient manipulating of your opportunities will win you victory points and, if you gain four, the game.

Not inherently bad, but very reminiscent of Tribune. Given that it has a theme I like much, much less than that of Tribune (ancient Rome may be overdone but this sort of silly corporate theme does nothing for me), has mechanisms that I like less than Tribune's, and seems likely to take longer on average, it's not likely I'd choose to play it.

Really love the theme here.  It's great satire in the context of the economic engine Eurogame from which it derives a lot of its mechanics.  Call me a raving leftist if you will, but business and growth are so ingrained as positive forces in the zeitgeist of boardgamers that it is refreshing to see it the other way.  Sure, being a capitalist is fun and all sometimes, but I can't help but being a little bit exasperated when there's yet another game that just came out about making shittons of money as a railroad baron.

Unfortunately, the gamplay doesn't quite measure up.  Though the mechanics flow neatly from the theme, and have lots of nice thematic touches, they don't meld very intuitively.  This is a game where you must beeline for your goals, and the mechanics are complicated enough that it's difficult to tell how to do that.  As a result, newbies often are out of the game before the first set of cards is finished, though they probably don't even know it yet.  The archenemy mechanic is original, though its also quite imbalancing.  If you get a weak player, the game is too easy, and if you get a strong player, the game is too hard.

Criminally underrated classic. There's many levers you can pull, and subtlety to how they can be used. Bribing is an integral part of the game and is done very well. This borrows from Tribune the "complete 4 of 6 possible victory conditions" concept and has the "reward for taking over but not for holding onto power" element of In the Shadow of the Emperor that encourages players to constantly shift their influence around and contest new areas, injecting dynamism into the area majority mechanic. That all said, PS is its own highly unique experience and if I might add feels more expansive and interactive than those other games. I love it!!

In this corporation-themed game, players compete to be the first to acquire four out of six possible victory points. You earn a point by reaching certain numbers along tracks, such as at least 7 on the influence track or 8 on the majority track. You also may earn a point by beating your secretly assigned archenemy on three specified tracks.

Reminds me of [gameid=30957] since each player has a choice of areas to aim for and score VPs in. However, here your objectives are more or less directed by the card you are dealt at the start of the game. The archenemy is a great idea, adding tension as you're always watching your enemy's progress and trying to outdo them surreptitiously.

This is not a complicated game, but there are a lot of moving parts which make it tricky to teach. I dislike the theme, and the event cards might as well not have any theme included on them as it was barely noticed in the game I played.

I think Power Struggle is commendable for the different interactions of each element on the board, as well as its take on the victory point condition.  I especially like the hidden goal of a nemesis.  However, there are a couple of problems I have with the game.

First of all, I don't believe all tracks are created equal.  Namely, I think the Corruption VP is set way too low at 9 while the Shares is too high at 18.  The former is easily obtainable because the act of bribing itself will give you a point regardless if you succeed or not, so you can low ball the offer with no downside.  If the other player agrees, you got a power you can possibly use later for cheap, but if he refuses, you can remove a cube of his, win-win.  It is also possible to get Corruption more than once in the same round if you accepts someone else's bribe.  Buying shares, on the other hand, requires at least twice the amount of money for the same point (and that is if the "1" blocks haven't been bought out), but that point is worth less because the track takes twice as long to reach the VP condition.

Then there is the fact that there is no way to remove someone's main department.  So as long as they control 3 out of 5 departments of a given division (with at least one being a main), it is no longer possible to take the control away.  Sure you can still bribe their privilege, but they could just as easily rendering the power inert by dismissing the division head.  Basically in the late game half of the board becomes somewhat useless because it is already a given who is going to end up with which division.  This also makes the powers of Development, Human Resources and even the Chairman less and less useful as the game progresses.

Power Struggle is an interesting game, but with its length and balance issue, it isn't one I'd be volunteering to play any time soon.

Very aptly named.  This is a power struggle, from start to finish.  It's fun, but it's not intuitive.  Be prepared to spend some time learning.

Really enjoyed my first play. Lots of interaction and for me an interesting theme (for another player it was a bit too close to real life :-) ). You need the right crowd to play this game and I think the game changes a lot depending on how you play the game (for example not accepting any bribes). Overall one of my highlights from Essen 2009.

Gave it 8.5 after first playing, good game really enjoy the theme of this, and the different ways you can build towards a victory. Had one or two minor issues with the rule book, but we soon sorted that out. Looking forward to my next playing now.  Reminds me a little bit of Tribune - probably because of the victory conditions.

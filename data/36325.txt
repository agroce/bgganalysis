Interesting game where half of cards are planes and the other half of cards are used as action cards. Depending on the planes' parameters, the player get to draw more cards (thus more options) or can play cards differently, etc. Without the missions (campaigns) the game is nothing special, but with those, it becomes a really nice card game. It's fast, it has some nice ideas blended in, it's an enjoyable experience.

RATING: 5
The game is an interesting hand-management card game, where your cards are both offensive and defensive in nature.

Basically, the game is an expensive 10 minute filler with a lot of cards.  In typical Dan Vessan ways, he added scenarios, but all they are are linked dogfights.  Do you really want to play the game 20 times?

I think this game would work better as a phone app.

Fun,fast & flexible. You'll neither need a pilot certificate nor a degree in maths to play this game, on the other hand it's not a sim proper, rather it gives you the feel of airplanes trying to outmaneuver each others. You can play 1 vs 1 fight (very random) to larger battle, each player can reasonably handle 2-4 aircraft.
Where the game really shines is with the campaign system, with a simple 1 page campaign display and a few rules the author turns this little card game in something more strategic. Moreover the 6 campaigns require different approach. Great playablity.

RATING: 8.5
I was skeptical that this would be better than the original 4-part GMT series, but it is a huge improvement!
 
Firstly, most of the cards now have a secondary use as maneuvers, so there's much less of "who drew the right cards" and much more canny flying and psychological guesswork. It feels a lot more like poker: will he chicken out because he;s bluffing? 

Secondly, each plane's performance now is divided into two card-draw phases. Some cards are drawn early to give even weak planes a reason to take  potshot or advantage an enemy. Then at the end of the turn thre is another card draw phase to replenish. So this adds a little for the under-powered planes to stand a chance against their high-performance brothers. 

It contains a great cross-section of planes from all theaters and years, as well as six varied campaigns. I'm glad to have supported this one with my pre-order (something I've doen exactly once previously). 
 
Rating is inital play. may rise due to simple fun and accesability.

A nice little cardgame that is light and fun.  The Campaigns really bring it up a notch otherwise it would really not have much going for it, but the campaigns give a longer term feeling of significance to the particular dogfights that you might find yourself in.  Definitely not a strategy game, but still a fun one.

A very good game with nice components. I do love the aircraft cards but would like to see some improvements on the action cards. I do like these better the way GMT did them.
Next to this the rulebook could use some adding in places, but the game plays nicely once any issues/questions are solved.

Absolutely love this game! Surprised at how good it is. Bought it out of frustration of Rise of the Luftwaffe taking too long and being convoluted. Haven't missed 'wingmen' at all while playing this. Combat is fast and furious. You're praying that your bombers will make it to the target to bomb. I like the simplified Campaign and bombing rules. A battle of wits between Flak pattern and bombing pattern. This game is so good I play it solo as much as I play it with others. It's very easy to set up and play. Brilliant assortment of aircraft available. Love the B17s. My buddies and I don't play Rise any more, we play this.

Terrific re-tweaking of the original DiF system. Unfortunately saddled with computery images on the cards and an over-simplified campaign and bombing system.

RATING: N/A
Down in Flame system with more campaigns.  The card art is revamped.  WWII air combat card game.

Still revolved around the card action and reaction (cancel) as the center game, an important change to the system is the differentiation of burst and damage in the former single firepower rating ("burst"). Bursts is now a measure of how many guns the aircraft has, and Damage is a measure of its shell size. 

So now you can see an aircraft with lots of light machine guns (ie the Spitfire I) and an aircraft with a few medium sized cannons (ie the Bf-109E), instead of both being assigned a burst rating of "1" only, the Spitfire I and Bf-109E, each have their own unique capabilities. The Spitfire has a Burst rating of “2”, with a Damage of “-1”, while the Bf-109E has a Burst “0” and Damage “+1”. This allows the Spitfire to take many shots, but they will inflict reduced damage, while the Bf-109E won’t get many shots, but when it hits, it will do extra damage. 

Note also how both aircraft still net out to a total Bursts and Damage value of “1”to keep the overall power balance in the previous system. 

6 campaigns are packaged in this game, offering more insight and depth of meaning to an otherwise single dull air dogfight.

[b]8: Very good game. Rarely disappoints me. High on my request/recommend list.[/b]

The Campaigns are where this game really shines. The one off dogfights are good if you only have 10-15 minutes or to teach the game. After learning the game though and if both parties like it, one should move on to the campaigns. Overall very neat mechanics (A little hard to get used to at first, but the payout is fun) and great fun "Gotcha!" "Nuh-uh got you!" back and forth style of play.

RATING: 5
Not a bad little game, all things considered. It's got just enough strategy to make it seem like it's not just the luck of the draw.

I think it would be more interesting if each plane had a unique deck that featured its strengths and weaknesses, or at least a few unique cards to add to a standard deck. There's not quite enough to differentiate between the planes, or at least I don't think so based on a first play. But possibly I am underestimating the differences.

RATING: 7.7
One of the few tabletop air combat games that can be played in something approaching real time. It's probably best played with one or two aircraft per player as otherwise juggling the separate hands of cards is an issue. You can get hosed by a bad draw but I see this as modelling the situation where one pilot is caught unawares and just can't think of anyway to escape or turn the tables.

The simple campaign system adds a little structure to an otherwise fairly light game and ensures the less glamorous aircraft get some air time.

RATING: 7.5
Fun, quick dogfighting game.  Does a great job of capturing the feel of a dogfight without all the rules of a usual hex-and-counter system.  Good refinement of the original Down in Flames.  Rules are a touch sketchy in places and components a little flimsy (though the cards are fine).

The game is excellent at what it does.  The cards are well made and very attractive.  

It is simple and easy to get into and gives a rewarding game play.  The simplicity dictates a lack of depth though.  So if you are looking for a deep experience, this would not be that game.  But getting young ones into it is very easy and teaching it is very easy.

Like I said it does what it does very well.  On that basis and comparison I score it high.

A great little card game with aspirations to higher things (npi).  Dogfights can be lightning quick or brutal tests of endurance -- fun is somewhere in the middle.  Great production on the cards.

finally played the new edition of DiF at KublaCon, after being one of the original pre-orderers, and I have to say...hmmmm.

Note, this is not considering the campaign rules which is where the original DiF really shined!

The artwork is VERY nice!  We played a couple multiplayer dogfights, and that may be a limitation as well, but I simply did not like the game as much without the wingman's ability to peel an attacker off of your tail.  This was a fundamental tactic, and just wasn't appropriately represented in the game--instead what you ended up with was these conga lines of planes.

I really like the draw phase at the beginning and end of the turn based on horsepower, but REALLY didn't like the way a defending plane is simply stripped of cards and left completely vulnerable to attack from other opponents.  Also, without a wingman, you were screwed if you didn't go first the next turn because you likely have only 1 or 2 cards.

Simply from the dogfight aspect, I enjoy the original game much more, even with the prettier artwork in the new version.

What a fun card game.  Altitude rules make for a very realistic (yet simple) addition to the plane combat mechanics.  I also think the card drawing mechanic is quite innovative with pre and post horsepower statistics.

This game seems to shine with more than two planes competing (free for all, or 2 vs 2)...or when using the scenario rules, but enjoyable nonetheless.

What a great card game - so many planes gives a huge variety, and loads of differnet ways to play.
Great artwork and cardstock means a fab gaming experience. Played this again and if I have a complaint some of the rules are slightly obtuse. It's only when we played that we started to understand them properly. But when yu do - my word! What a fab game with loads of replay value - and we haven't even done a campaign yet.
Well done Dan.

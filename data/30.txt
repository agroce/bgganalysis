RATING: 8
What a great game this was back in 1980. It was way ahead of its time as home computers were just starting to show up in stores and game systems were still relatively new. I loved this game!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I imagine this game is for others like Talisman is for me. I really like Talisman because it brings me back to long gaming nights in highschool with good friends, giving it a better ranking than it deserves. I just found Dark Tower boring like so many find Talisman.

Had seen young male teenagers playing the game, unwilling to communicate to the waiting girls! 
So I thought it MUST be a super game, because who is willing to turn down a talk to girls at that age!!!
Later I bought the game and had lots of fun...

Seems kind of like Talisman, but with a big electronic tower that tells you what happens to you, and it's largely multilayer solitaire.

RATING: 7
Dark Tower is a fantasy RPG that uses an electronic tower to resolve battles and keep track of players stats.  It's probably the first of it's kind and is a lot of fun to play every once in a while for nostalgic purposes (especially after a few drinks).

RATING: 3
*Rating based on 1 play.

Played a game of this with someone who wanted to play for sentimental reasons.  This game seems a good example of how far game design has come in 30 years.  The game is mostly an exercise in memory and bookkeeping with very little strategy and heaps of luck.  The electronic tower substitutes a random number generator for dice or cards.  It was halfway interesting to play once, but I wouldn't bother playing again.

RATING: 8
Man...  I love this game.  Probably because I grew up with it.  What it lacks in just about everything else, it makes up for it in atmosphere.  Bob Pepper's art is some of the best commercial art I've ever seen.  I rate it highly because of this.

RATING: 7
This is an 80's classic. I found my set at Goodwill, in good working order, for $2.50. Lots of bookkeeping, though. I don't think I've ever properly kept track of my food. Every so often, we'll just all do an Inventory turn to make sure we're on track. Brigands!

Loved this game as a teenager, so much so that I designed a mainframe computer version of it in high school. Gameplay is not all that great after experiencing the exciting world of Euro-games, but still very cutting edge for the time and well-implemented. Fine example of a hybrid computer/board game--I'd like to see more of that equally well done.

In so many ways opens a nostalgic portcullis into the 80s sword and sorcery craze. Cool looking map, fantastic art. Opening the tomb - creeeeeeeak!  

But you've got to track your food and encumbrance! Thank you E. Gary G!

It was very fun though. The red numbers flashing, your forces vs the brigands. Trending up? Trending down? Oh no. Oh man. Come on, fight you cowards!

Would love to play on the board with my kids.

Now we're talking.  I was 9 years old and saw the commercials with Orson Welles shilling "Dahhk tower" and had to have it.  Plus I was developing an interest in D&D and I suppose that helped.  We used to love playing this game, which was quite advanced for its time.  I believe I learned the term "haggle" from it.  My Dad used to joke about building up a huge army and just "storming that tower."  I kept this on my shelf until I was well into my teens, even though I stopped playing it around 11.  For whatever reason the box wasn't big enough to close completely over that unwieldy tower; how had it originally been packaged, anyway?  I had a set of star stickers with my name on them and proudly put one of them across the front of that big brown box.

OK, so maybe it's not a great game and the decisions are pretty obvious, but I still enjoy it.  Maybe it's nostalgia, maybe it's that cool electronic tower in the center of the board, and maybe it's the awesome "beep" music it plays.

This game was way ahead of its time.  I love the idea and the look of this game, but it's borderline unplayable.  There just isn't much of a game here, which is unfortunate.

With all the news of games that integrate electronic devices, I could easily see this coming back with an updated version that lets you use a smart phone to generate the events, the fluctuating market, treasure distribution, etc.

RATING: 8
I LOVED this game as a kid.  I can still hear all of the sounds from the game:  the creak of the Tomb door, the call to battle against the Brigand horde, the trumpet blasts of victory!  I still think this is one of the most original, most coolest games I have ever played, no matter that it's all luck whether the Tower blesses you with a "Lost" when you have the Healer or Dragons your Warriors to cinder.

RATING: 6.5
Some very fond family time from my youth was spent around the whirling and dizzying sounds of doors creaking, battle updates, dragons, and haggling in the bazaar. It's easy to comment on the technological leaps that came with the game (someday this approach to board gaming will rise again) and completely miss that this is also a very beautiful in all artistic respects. Not a great game, but it's fun to play every once in a while. I won't shell out big bucks to get one for myself---but I have very positive and fond memories of this game.

When I was a kid (up till the age of 12 or so) I would have ranked this 9 or 10. I didn't own it but everytime I went to my friend's house, I wanted to play, and it never got old. As an adult I purchased one off ebay to fulfill a childhood fantasy of owning it, but after playing half a dozen times it's lost a lot of its re-play factor. However, when my wife and I babysit our friends' kids, they ALWAYS want to play...just like me. This is the top of the electronic games that came out during the '80s...hell, Orson Welles did the commercials. And the artwork is still stunning. It would be nice if there was a more involved board game version using the same beautiful paintings.

RATING: 6
Used to have this game, played it incessantly - even gave up having a Christmas tree that year so i could have it.  Found a java version online and realized the travel parts of the game were too deadly to balance out the loot from battle, so remembered our various ways to cheat to make game play less tedious.  But a sentimental favorite.

RATING: 5
Children's / family game that bridged the gap from board games to eventual computer gaming.  An electronic Dark Tower would randomly issue effects when your token landed on various spaces on the board.  The gameboard was round with a handful of 3D plastic buildings on it for effect.

This game brought many hours of fun to my friends and I in elementary school. I remember there was a problem with ripping through the batteries, though.  In the end, my friend who owned the game got some of the first generation of rechargable batteries, but despite playing as fast as we could they invariably ran out before we reached the end of the game.  What a bummer!

RATING: 7
So what if the game isn't all that great?  It looks amazing (that guy's art is PHENOMENAL), the Tower completely rocks on every level, and it's one of the prime artifacts of growing up as a nerdy kid in the 1980s.  You don't play Dark Tower because it's a strategy game, you play it because you dig the beeps and whirs and yelling because you think the Tower hates you.  If only modern games were this much fun...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Had a blast with this as a kid, but I'm afraid it's a bit of a stinker as an adult.  I can still accurately describe the other players' activities by the sounds alone.  Pressing your luck at the bazaar was tense, and the Bakshi-esque art was neat.  And at least this game presents you with some decisions.

Guessing at number of games played.

I bought this game for $0.50 at a rummage sale.  All that is missing is the original box.  It has the orginal game box top glued onto a sturdy generic card board box.  Otherwise the game was mint and works perfectly.  Another one of my best finds ever!!!

Many fond memories of playing this one.  Fun solo game too.

My tower no longer works.  Hasn't worked for years.  Debating on getting the tower fixed again when the kids get a bit older.  

This game is ridiculously expensive.  Always wish they could get around the legal hurdles for a re-issue.

December 2009 - Opened it up. Cleaned the battery terminals with some steel wool.  Forced the movement of the main to make the carousel spin again.  Replaced the burnt out bulb.  Now it works.  Hot diggity dog.  Now the question is, do I sell it?

Kids love this game and have played it a couple times solo.  They all know that its pure luck, but enjoy the theme and adventure of it.

RATING: 6
I picked this game up, several years ago, strictly on a nostalgic fancy.  I remember playing this with the grown-ups in my family and having a really good time.  Considering these memories were from the early eighties, I should not have been surprised at the disapointment that I felt after playing a few games.  There was a single year in which this game was manufactured, which should indicate how successful the game was at merging video games with board games.  

Gameplay involves moving from area to area within one of four territories.  Players input this data into the tower, which generates an encounter and displays it by spinning, and lighting a single image on a transparent cylinder within the tower's window.  This continues until a player has found all three keys and can enter the tower and attempt to win the "Final Battle".  There is no player interaction.  Tracking data is done on a player peg-board.  Needless to say, with all the different types of dungeon-crawlers and adventure games out there, this is underwhelming and feels slightly automated.  The only decisions available to the player is where to move and when to go to the tower.

I don't have any regrets with my purchase.  The game looks good when setup and it helps me remember fun times as a child.  I'll definitely open it up and play it with my daughter when she's old enough.

+1 Personal Rating for nostalgia.

Condition: Tower works and game is 100% complete; however, the flags have issues: 3 have been repaired [neatly] but 2 are missing the wide bit at the base [have crafted a suitable replacement from pencil erasers] but 1 is missing the flagpole altogether. In addition, 1 figure is missing its sword. All other parts are complete and in good [and original/unrepaired] condition.

Box has wear issues including a tape-lift scuff on the cover and several split corners on the lid. However, overall, it is still both presentable and functional.

A silly game with ridiculously ambitious computer control for 1981.  Absurdly expensive at the time of its release (similar in price to current FFG productions!!).  I love this game in a fully nostalgic game.  There isn't too much to it, but it's not entirely brainless.  Mostly it's a game of logistics, as the tasks are more or less completed in fixed order.

While I give it a 4 overall it still should be played by anyone who was growing up in the era when this came out.  The wonderful production, the whiring, blinking and beeping tower... all of that should be experienced at least once for nostalgia's sake.  The game itself it completely random, the tower just replacing what would be a bunch of tables you'd otherwise have to roll on.  I played it a couple of times and then sold it off as it just isn't a very compelling game in and of itself.  Get it, play it and then get rid of it.

My copy is beat to hell and the tower has nasty alkalized crud in the battery compartment, so it may not work but I do still technically own it.  I loved this game back in the day and I suspect it would still be great in that "gateway game" way.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I was 21 when this game came out, so I was blissfully unaware of its existance.  In other words, there is zero nostalgia for me with this game and it has to stand or fall on its merits.  First off, the tower, which is the whole point of the game, is a very well built monolith.  Given its age, the presence of light bulbs, and all the mechanical whirring going on, I would expect mine to be in poor shape.  Heck, the box, board, and Pegasus chips sure show their age!  But no, the tower still glistens, looking like new.  As for the game, I find it to be dead, dead, dead boring.  Move a space, push a button, watch the tower, turn's over.  Finally, someone wins.  Yeah.  If it were just me I would give this a 2.  But my kids, well, they love that tower.  My 8-year-old daughter's eyes light up as she is watching her warriors thrash the brigands.  Obviously, this game still has the appeal for the younger crowd.  Perhaps she will one day be nostalgic about it herself.

I was excited to find this in my parents basement over Christmas. The tower *still* works (although the bottom panel keeping the batteries in is missing). And I have the board, but almost nothing else. I played mainly against the tower itself and it's still pretty amusing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Played for the first time just recently, with a friend who bought it at a yard sale a few years ago, and our wives.  It was fun, and I think it holds up reasonably well.  I think if it were published today, with a deck (or decks) of cards instead of the tower, those who dismiss it as a toy would probably take it more seriously as a solid "beer and pretzels" game.

The only issue was that the batteries started to go out towards the end of the game, so we weren't able to finish.  We're looking forward to trying it again.

I received this game as a gift in the early years of marriage. I spent most of that winter's free time playing with the game -- which I still have. The last time I looked at it, I thought it had given up the ghost, but a few moments fumbling with the Tower unjammed something and it came to life. Which was a pleasant development.

RATING: 5
The holiest of holy.  I know this isn't the greatest game ever created, but it is certainly the most lauded, and it has a deserving place in my collection of 1980s MB games of plastic and craziness.  The Ameritrash dream.  It is a very random affair. I'm glad there are decisions to be made in terms of which buildings to visit and manipulating the bazaar. But really that is about it in terms of major decision making. Regardless, a marvel of vintage electronics and just a great looking game given all its chrome.  I'm happy to own it, love the artwork, and quite appreciate for what it is as long as all players' expectations are matched.

I saved my money up for this one when I saw the commercial on TV.  I spent $44.89 back on May 12th, 1982(still have the receipt in the box).  I ordered it through Sears and waited anxiously for it.  I was intrigued by the game for the first 8-10 playings.  Then I figured out most of the patterns the computer runs through.  I recently have played several games with my son and daughter who think it is pretty cool.  I'll play it on their request since it is still fully functional (I even still have the replacement light bulb kit).

Breakthrough in its time (1981-82).  Earliest game suffered from some quality control issues, which in time killed it.  However, we were lucky I guess: ours lasted literally years.  Played A LOT; my bud's and my girlfriends really liked it (they could beat us at a "strategy" game).  Some great lessons here about integrated microprocessors and boardgames.  One hopes after 20+ years a game company will come to and produce something like it with 2008 technology...

If you don't like this game, you take gaming far too seriously.  DO NOT play this with the droid app.  Playing this game without the tower is like buying a Ferrari and storing it in a glass garage.
Some say it's all luck and no strategy, but these statements are not completely true. There are some elements of resource management and movement planning.  The best strategy is to get around the board as quickly as possible but it's easy to get distracted by the desire to have more troops or buy goodies from the bazaar.  Granted, if you can't stand games with dice rolls or elements of luck then you won't like how this game (or life, for that matter) treats you.  The fun is in the interaction with the tower's old-school midi sounds.  The gameplay itself is reasonably easy for most kids and non-gamers to learn but there is some strategy once you know how the game tower 'thinks'.  My goal is to simply get a rating by the tower of something other than 00!

I craved this game soooo badly as a youngster. I ended up with the Dungeons & Dragons Electronic Labyrinth instead (the actual first electronic board game).

I'm rating this to dissuade someone thinking of buying it who isn't familiar with it. Its only value is the nostalgia factor. Yes, it was fun as a teen, but even then only for awhile and for its "wow" factor. The technology is 22 years old and will not wow you now except in a "what was it like in the stone ages, dad?" kind of way. Once you get past the "cool" tower, the game play is extremely uninspired.

**PURE NOSTALGIA RATING: 9** 

truly, in my day this game kicked every games ass. Hands down. The tower spinning, the blare of the casio battle charge....the dark hordes of digital clock numbers unleashed against my red peg troops had me tense and sweating. I could totally relate to the eye of sauron spinning around the world (I know it's not Tolkien, but it made me think of it). My friend and I played this A LOT. Very fond memories and I treasure this game, the box, the bits, the tower. By today's standards...maybe a 6 or so - Ok game, some fun or challenge at least, will play sporadically if in the right mood. I'm going to break this out again and see how it goes.

Ok..not much of a game, but it has a cool electronic tower.  I owned this as a kid, not sure what happened to my original copy.

One day, the wife and I were driving around looking at houses and we saw a sign for a garage sale.  I turned to my wife and said, "They'll have a copy of Dark Tower for sale." (or something to that end).    A minute later, we drove by the garage sale and there it was.  I bought it for $1.  I couldn't get my wallet out of my back pocket fast enough.

Cool concept... but absolutely no player interaction.  For its time though, this was 'cutting edge' electronics.

Make the right moves at the right time, win a few critical battles, and you'll be on your way to victory.  It's basically a race game with a lot of 'bells and whistles.'

Fun to watch the Tower perform for a couple of plays, but not much else.  A dice roll for most of the actions would have done the same thing.

Played this game a lot.  A luck driven "dungeon crawl" where the tower is the DM.  A cool part of the game is seeing how much haggling you can pull of at the bazaar (3 for a warrior, once) plus since it's a race of sorts no one can get way ahead (unless that key just never comes up for you). Great bits, easy play and fun.  Has choices but isn't going to give you analysis paralysis.

A not-horrible bit of nostalgia from the pre-Internet Age, the tower is even more of a novelty as a spiffed up calculator that is so huge that it doesn't even fit properly back in the giant box.  Yeah, Space Age 1981 tech meets bastardized Tolkien in a Geeksplosion, but the game is barely worth playing.  Strangely, it reminds me a bit of Runebound.  Give the Flash version a try before you shell out big bucks to put this one behind glass for the Ebayers of the future.

Where to start with this one? Well first of all the actual design of the tower, and the implementation is pure genius. WAY ahead of it's time.  It does seem to be randomized, unlike the R2-D2 from the original Star Wars Trivial Pursuit.  

Now, onto the bad stuff: This is basically Talisman trumped up with an awesome gadget.  It also seems like the game plays you rather than the other way around. It also suffers from horrible 70's/80's fantasy art (although to be fair the art is better than the 2nd edition Talisman art).  The components, other than the tower, are just plain horrible (well I take that back, the sculpts for the figures and the buildings are quite good, and the colors were well chosen).  The player boards are just plain horrible. Why on Earth would you make it necessary to place a peg into something that is basically paper thin?  The flags were also falling out of the board.  An update to the board, and player boards would greatly improve the experience of this one.  

The Dark Tower itself gets a rating of 10 in my book, the game on the other hand, not so much.

This game was SO COOL when we first got it!  There was nothing like it!  I miss those jaded years, and it's not very fun to play as an adult, but the 7-13 range really does enjoy it.

RATING: N/A
My brother and I had this when we were kids, we were both too young to know how to play the game, but had a blast playing with the electronic tower... I can still hear the attacking / bazaar / door opening sounds in my head!  Everything but the tower was gone rather quickly (we were WAAAAY too young for the game), but remember seeing the tower under the bathroom sink a couple of years ago.  Next time I'm back home I'm going to look for it and see if it still works!

For what this game was in the days when it was produced, this was cutting edge, high-tech and pretty awesome. the electronic tower keeps track of every player's progress (you can play solo if you want) and delivers random encounters, even offers haggling at the bazzar.

I took a lot of heat from my parents when I asked for this game as a kid.  Back in the early 80's this game cost over $80... which was a mint for a game back then. (still a bit much to pay for a game today!)  They finally relented, and I loved it!  The simple computer, and the great artwork. I got many solid years of play out of this with my Jr. High Gamer pals.  Like an Atari 2600 though, the games have become much more advanced nowadays.

This may be a 30 year old "computerized" game that seems a bit disco these days, but it will always hold a place in my heart as a childhood favorite.  I spent many days playing Dark Tower as a kid.  Nowadays, I wonder exactly how having a healer when you get the plague makes another soldier.

RATING: 4
I had one of these as a kid and loved it.  The reason for the low rating is my tower broke after a few games and that was the end of it all.  The quality of it obviously wasn't too good.

I did play it again using a PC version (I still keep that on my machine and play it every so often).  One tends to realize though that almost the entire mechanic of combat was based off luck or the tower's whim.  You could have a ginormous army and still lose to a handful of brigands if you were lucky.  More often than not though, it's the huge band of brigands that gets defeated by a handful of soldiers.

Either way, it's worth the walk down memory lane.

Dated and primitive by today's standards, Dark Tower was nevertheless an astonishing achievement when it was released in 1981. Every aspect of the game was monitored by a small computer inside the black plastic shell of the tower itself, an unheard of innovation at the time. Players input their moves on a small membrane keypad each turn and the computer took over from there, doing everything from conducting the progress of battles to keeping track of how much (or little) food was left to feed the players' always hungry warriors. It could even play recognizable pieces of music at significant points during the game.

I still have my original copy from 1981 and the tower is still working, lights and all!!  Yes, maybe nostalgia has a lot to do with the high ratings for this game, but that does mean something, right??  I still enjoy playing this game with friends... when I can get them together that is!!  This is one game that should DEFINITELY get a sequel at some point!!  How about a tower with a LCD screen??  Instead of still pictures they could have moving hand-drawn animation!!  Add some more bad-guys to the mix... and fix the fighting element.  Make the number of "brigands" that you fight be RANDOM instead of always being close to the number of warriors that you have!!  That way, you might actually want to retreat right away if they have some huge number over you!!  And how about upping the number of possible players to SIX!!  With six seperate kingdoms on the board you would have to collect FIVE keys before returning to your own Kingdom!!  Can you imagine trying to solve the riddle of the keys with FIVE????

I had been told about this game by some guys in my group.  Then low and behold at BGG.Con 2012 they find a copy in the library and it makes it to the table.

I can imagine this game was a technological marvel in it's day.  A little cheesy now, but what an awesome theme.  I didn't care that it was outdated.  We had a blast playing it.

A blast from the past this one.  Possibly one of the first electronic games I played.  All these years later the game is still great fun, if very simple, to play.  A race to the finish game with lots of luck thrown in.  A classic.

RATING: N/A
Condition Let me say the box bottom has ware and tear you would expect for a 30 year old game. As for the top let us just say it’s destroyed and then you will be surprised no matter what. Acually the top is present but very rough. It has brown tape around all edges lots of split sides and corners . Someone has used a little pen ink on the box as well. There are also a few sticker residue marks from some Gummy Bears stickers that I removed from the cover. So Like I said the box top in particular is very rough the box bottom is not great.

Components wise there are a few blemishes. 
1 Gold key is missing, 1 Pegasus token is missing and the dragon flag that goes on top of the tower is broken the flag part is their the pole part is not. All in all nothing essential for sure but a few minor things that I wanted to let you know about.

Tower has been used to play about 5 games recently and it works.  I will retest it before I accept a trade.

Great game, and entirely like magic when it was initialy released in my childhood. I remember begging my uncle to take it out of the closet everytime I was over visiting. Later in my adulthood I snagged a very clean working copy off of ebay at a marginally reasonable price. My wife and I enjoy playing it still. 

There's a flash version of the game i've played but its just not the same without the mechanical whir of the carousel as you await your fate to be backlit.

Having never owned this as a kid, I am free from the mind-altering nostalgia that has unfortunately affected numerous people. Yes, in 1981, this was a REALLY cool gadget. But even in 1881, any sane person should have been able to see that the technology was covering up an atrociously bad game. Your "decisions" amount to pressing the right button on the Tower and correctly adjusting the Battleship-like pegs on your character's cardboard sheet. We played a few rounds before the batteries died (a very common problem it seems) and rather than make an extra trip to get some new ones, we all decided that we had seen enough and that this game is better left as a find memory (or, for those of us that never had a chance to play it back in the day, a mysterious techno-oddity from a much simpler time).

I've been playing this game since 1984 or so, and it's still entertaining enough today.  Absolutely amazing technology for its time.  Don't go nuts and pay a ton of money to acquire it though... there are better non-electronic fantasy board games for a 1/4th the price available these days.  Dark Tower's better as a museum piece than anything else in modern times.

I've had mine since I bought it new "off the shelf" ($60). This game is king of the hill in the electronic / boardgame combo genre with Stop Thief taking second place. Sure it won't appeal to people who believe that every gaming experience needs to be a 6 hour, head pounding, mensa marathon, but for those with a little imagination and a willingness to play for the "fun" of it, it's a great game.

A nostalgic game for me, but one that doesn't offer much in the way of a game. I play this solo the same reasons I'd play patience solitaire. There aren't many interesting decisions, you just go where you want and you randomly get what you needed or you don't. But it is a fun 20 minutes.

Much better, but still not amazing, as a multiplayer game where the race against the opponents is what matters.

This comment is spoken by me at age 12:   The best fantasy boardgame ever made.   :)
Dark Tower doesn't get the appreciation it truly deserves.
Its use of technology/electronics is STILL, to this day, unsurpassed by any other boardgame. That is absurd that boardgames haven't taken advantage of the creative opportunities that Dark Tower showed could be brought to mainstream America. It even had a TV commercial featuring Orson Welles!
If game designers had taken note of Dark Tower more, boardgames might not be the red headed stepchild of American entertainment that they are.

RATING: N/A
Very Fine Near Mint condition. Found a fantastic copy on Ebay with a box that looks like it just came off the store shelf. The tower has 30 year old batteries in it but the corrosion (there was a ton of it) somehow stayed inside the tower and I was able to clean it out and it looks new. With a little reading on the Internet I was able how to figure out how to get the motor spinning again with minimal effort. Looks and plays like new. If you are even remotely handy with tools I recommend finding a great looking copy of the game with a non-functioning tower. You may be able to fix it yourself and towers in near mint condition are very easy to find. Finding a Dark Tower box in NM condition or a map board that does not have corner damage is extremely difficult. You can find both at once but you will pay through the nose ($250.00 or more).Feel free to contact me if you have any questions.

Rating is for nostalgiac reasons--this game was so fun when I was 9 years old--keep in mind, no PCs, no DnD (at least not for me at that age), no nothing.  This was pretty darn cool.  It definteily loses something so many years later, but I still pull it out every now and again.  Probably not very engaging for "seasoned" gamers, but it's not abysmal.  If I played today with no background, I'd probably give it like a 4.5-5.5 or somewhere in there.

Aquired a copy at a rummage sale. This is something that I would have LOVED as a kid. However, the game pretty much plays itself. The tower keeps track of EVERYTHING. The only thing a player really does is decide where to move. No real need for anything else. Sold on eBay $$$

Alright, it's a classic. But it did not age well at all. Be reminiscent all you want, this one is a stinker nowadays. You just walk aorund the country getting decimated, then going back to the bazaar buying new guys to be decimated again.

Had this when I was a kid and it was a blast! I loved the artwork and the anticipation of waiting for that creepy, creaky vault door to open. Like so many others, though, this went to the curb at some point and I now occasionally browse the ebay listings hoping for that lucky (affordable) find.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This is more of a competetive solitaire type of game.  There is very, very little interaction between the players (there is one time in the game where you can "curse" another player) but quite a bit of suspense.  It's essentially an exploration game.  You carry food, gold, and warriors with you on a quest to find  keys to open the tower and defeat the demons within.  As you move, your warriors consume food - run low on food, and armies start dying off.  Your armies fight monsters at ruins and caves as you search for the keys.  All in all very simple and not deep, but the tower sounds and lights add an element of suspense that was incredible at the time.  I think the technology is very dated now, and wouldn't impress, but was a great advancement at the time.  A good example of using technology to enhance a game, and not just to dress it up.

Played the online version.  It was probably fantastic in its day and I remember lusting for it as a child, but my parents never bought it for me.  It baffles me that this sells for so much as it really isn't that much fun.  Only nostalgia keeps this game on so many people's radar screens.

RATING: 6
Wow!  We had a whole lot of fun with this one back in the day.  It was like Dungeons and Dragons with a computer boardgame.  How cool was that?  Looking back, though, while a lot of fun to play, it was pretty scripted, something I picked up on a little even then.  I had a strategy mapped out that I was going to follow as close to the letter as possible.  Sure, random events could interfere with it, but ultimately, would only delay it, not stop it.  For that reason, it is not a game I would seek out to play these days.  However, I would willingly play it every now and again simply for nostalgia sake.  [08/20/2007]

need to pay homage. a realization, i've really been a geek since the 3rd grade. loved, loved this game. i remember asking my mom "what's a brigand?" ... went thru new batteries daily. it likely wouldn't stand the test of time (it's predictable & the map routes don't change.) but, damn, this was the business when i was 9.

RATING: 7
Rating is purely a nod to nostalgia. I remember saving up my money for weeks to buy this as a kid. Unfortunately sold it with a perfectly working tower many years ago but then repurchased it because of it's nostalgic value. For it's day this was an amazing game...solely due to the electronic tower. To have a "computer" streamline and manage essentially all this information for up to 4 players was revolutionary to board gamers back then (think i-phone today). My rating for 1981 is a 9, for 2017 it's a 5...so I went with an average of 7.

Let's play again was the response to this, at least in early 80's when it came out. Ok, it was fairly simple but the tower was almost mind blowing at the time. Wore out the electronics in a few months and never saw it again.

I played this thing quite literally to death.  The Tower eventually stopped functioning.  I'm amazed MB hasn't rereleased it, as I believe it would hold up well today and still find quite a market!  I can only assume the suits fear it wouldn't be able to compete with videogames.

Without the tower, this game wouldn't be on anyone's radar. In fact, the game-play is on the boring side. But there's something geeky-cool about that  whirring, beeping black overlord that salvages the game and makes it fun to break out on occasion.

RATING: 9
A slice of board game history.  Awesome 1981 MB release, one of their finest moments.  This is dripping with theme, unlike many other contemporary counterparts from the stable.

Longish game with mostly outstanding components.  The tower makes very pleasing analogue blips & whirs.  The instruction manual is extensive and very well organised.  Always commence each game with a new set of batteries.

Criticisms: the box.  If the original insert is lost, storage becomes problematic as the tower is about 2" too thick for the box and the lid does not fit securely AT ALL.  The scorecards could have been designed to be a little more user-friendly.

May very well be one of the greatest games of all time!  They need to solve the law suit that has kept a re-make of this game under wraps for years.  However, there are a lot of folks out there making money repairing the towers, and selling pieces of the game.  Did you happen to see the sealed version floating out there that went for over $2,500.  That should tell you something.

This was my first boardgame that was truly my own. Incredible electronic interaction for the time and beautiful sculpted bits made for a great game. As I lost pieces and the board wore out I ended up memorizing the board and playing only with the tower.

RATING: 4
Runs on its gimmick of the tower.  It's a great gimmick, but ultimately the only purpose it serves is a randomizer, but with bad electronic music thrown in.  Charming, but unsatisfying from a gameplay point of view.  Mostly luck-driven.  Few interesting decisions to be made.

I loved this when I was a teenager, back when computer games had blocky graphics and nobody had heard of the Internet. Gameplay is simple and random but predictable after a while.

Even 25 years later, this game never ceases to enchant me.  Though the box is well-worn and some of the pieces are broken (mostly the little flagpoles that held the various banners of each country), the Dark Tower is still going strong!  I have never had to change a single lightbulb (and yes, I still have the bulb replacement kit)!  One of the best boardgames ever!

RATING: 7
One of my favortie pre-computer elektronic games. I played this countless times as a kid since I was fascinated with the setting and the electronic tower. However I took it out recently and while I consider this one an important game for me, it is so because of its history. It is still an enjoyable game but since I do have a computer now I know that so much more can be done with the concept - even with hybrid computerboard games.

What escapes most people is the reason this game re-sells for so much.  In an age when computer games were mostly text based with marginal PC speaker sound (atari 2600 and arcades were there too) Dark Tower had lights, pictures, and sounds above any multiplayer computer game.  It set the multimedia stage for computer games to evolve into.  Historically its one of a kind -- despite its poor gameplay.

A little gem. Very easy to teach and learn but with a surprising amount of depth. Player interaction is high although not of the "take that" kind. Clever integration of worker placement/auction/tile laying/pick up and delivery that feels right and not forcefully bound together. The second edition (which I own), fixes many complaints about the board which was too difficult to read.
Best at 4p.

Surprisingly fun old school game. I only played with 2 variants suggested in the rulebook and 4 player. The variants are: Variable turn order based on bidding lowest and score 2 and 1 extra point for having most money. The gui in this game is not the greatest. Ended up using the provided stickers to cut out smal squares and wrote how many houses each tile contains. That improved the gameplay speed... i like how this game is not a typical engine builder and that it has intresting bidding, tile laying and cruncy multilayered workerplacement. But the variable turnorder variant is a must. Its also nice to look at your bord afterwards and your acomplishments. Replayability is unfortunally low. With an expansion that ads varity i can see this game be an 8.

Played this at a local game fair with three players. Reasonably quick to learn, this is a breezy worker placement game. It's an intriguing mix between mechanics as tile retrieving, tile placement and bidding for abilities.

This being a fairly light game, I'm wondering how this holds up after repeated plays. It's good to know the 2nd print run of this game addresses the hard to distinguish tiles and player order, which is extremely important for claiming tiles and bidding.

Interesting game but not $80 Funagain interesting

Players place markers on a central grid.  They can either take the tile under where they put the marker or one of two actions on the row/column where the tile is.  Then it's a "build your city, get pizzas and deliver them" sort of game.  But the action selection/tile acquisition sounds interesting

An outstanding game seriously hampered by ghastly graphic design decisions.  Whether it is the indistinguishable purple and brown player pieces, or the overwrought and indecipherable town tiles that are the key to the game, the artist and other consultants who put this ghoulish mess together should be ashamed.  Otherwise, a fine set of mechanics with lots of decisions and pathways to victory.  Would have been better if we weren't forced to spend so much time figuring out things we shouldn't have had to bother with.

Lovely theme, nice components, good to play a couple of times. I didn't find anything novel or exciting, the most interesting part being the tile placement. The bidding seems contrived and a lazy design solution, and the slider increase idea borrowed straight out of Goa. Just an ok game, would play it if in a pinch, but will never seek it.

Thema sehr schön: Pizzaservice aus Napoli liefert auf der Vespa Pizzen aus. Mechanisch treffen sich bewährte Dinge: Setzspiel, Legespiel, Bietspiel, Entwicklungstableau, Logistik. Vor allem Logistik. Alles greift gut ineinander. Lediglich die sonst von mir geschätzte Buntheit wirkt hier wahllos und ist mehr Irritation statt Augenschmaus. Warum PAPA PAOLO bei mir dennoch nicht meinen Gusto trifft, ist geschmäcklerisch. PAPA PAOLO lässt sich gut berechnen. Gute Logistiker werden nach wenigen Partien das Spiel perfekt beherrschen. Dann entscheiden minimale Kleinigkeiten. PAPA PAOLO ist ein Zielfotospiel, indem die eine Pizzeria knapp vor dem anderen gewinnt. Das genüssliche Thema steht hier im Gegensatz zum mathematischen Wesen des Spiels, das mich diesbezüglich und in puncto Punktunterschiede am Schluß etwas an SHAKESPEARE erinnert.

Opinió després de un lectura de regles: no té mala pinta, però és massa euro i em sembla que li falta interacció (cada jugador forma un barri mitjançant losetes davant seu i reparteix pizzes en el seu territori només, sense poder influenciar en els dels demés). És com una especie de Carcassonne barrrejat amb el food Chain Magnate però amb mapes individuals.

RATING: 6
An OK game about pizza delivery to Italian neighbourhoods. The game phases feel very disjointed from one another. It's as if you're playing multiple different games that is combined into a single package. Some game mechanics also feel like its recycled from other games (ie Bruxelles from the row and column auction). The houses on the neighbourhood tiles are also very hard to differentiate from some of the facade (bear in mind I'm not color blind). Very poorly thought out design for the houses. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
First comments focus on the disjoint between the simple theme of delivering pizza in Naples and the multitude of mechanisms ranging from tile-laying your own quarter of the city, gaining majorities in a central action grid, developing your engine on your own player board and auctioning deliveries.

None of that is a problem. The mechanisms are well intertwined, they work smoothly (with the possible exception of a too tame auction system with not enough money in the system and too many alternative options). My problem with the game is the lack of differentiation. The scoring categories are limited. The results will be very close unless a player makes severe mistakes such as not caring about money supply. An ok game with entertaining tactical races for tiles, actions and majorities but nothing outstanding.

Played once. Nice puzzle to build a neighbourhood where you can efficiently deliver lots of pizza's. Mostly wonderful components, but the roof colours (esp. red and yellow) are not always clear - but I hear this was improved in the 2nd printing.
The auction feels a bit disjointed from the rest of the game, and interaction felt low, but having played only once I don't know if that is typical.
On the whole: good fun, solid game, would like to play again.

Pizza delivery in Naples. Area control, bidding, tile placement, pick-up and deliver, a lot mechanisms are included. Players place workers on a grid representing the city of naples. You either take the tile and place it in your district or take the associated action of either the column or the row. Actions are baking pizzas, express delivery, get money from bank, or build additional pizzeria. Majority in each column and row gives money. 
In the second phase you build on delivery tokens that show how many pizzas you can deliver and how far (counting the tiles between your pizzeria and the house you deliver to). When you delivered pizza to each house on a tile (1, 2, or 3) you advance on one of four tracks depending on the house color (red, green, blue, and yellow). This allows you to improve the actions in the first phase, getting you more money (yellow), more pizza when baking (blue), express delivering more pizzas (red), or deliver in multiple directions (green, not necessary when you build your district with foresight). Your lowest track gives you bonus points.

It is medium weight, plays fast (20min per player) and offers a well blended mix of mechanics. The bidding phase, however, ruined it for me,  as most available deliveries are good enough that we did not fight over them and everyone got theirs for the minimal bid.

Game about the process of starting your pizza company. Building pizzeria's, baking pizza's and delivering to customers acquired is all part of it. The game does have very busy chaotic graphics that you have to get used to. But once you get over these graphics, a very solid game remains. The process is well translated into game mechanisms, that I recognize from Bruxelles 1893, a game the designer likes a lot. So known mechanisms, but interactive enough and implemented to this theme, it all comes together very well.

A euro mishmash of games we have seen before, Papa Paolo pulls them together smoothly. We see the tile matrix from Automania, the skill tracks from Hansa Teutonica, auctions inspired by Amun Re, even Food Chain Magnate's delivery system. Building your neighborhood and delivering pizza (both passively and actively) is a fun optimization puzzle and focusing on different skill tracks can give you a slightly different experience each game (speculated).

In my one play, all four players ended within two points of each other. I don't call this out as a problem in all games, but here it especially felt that no action taken by anyone was all that differentiating. No choice felt clever. I'm not certain what "good play" looks like here. I enjoyed my play. I'd play again. But I have no drive because it felt like all the choices were equal and thus no choice was tense.

Gioco semplice ma non banale. E' stato demolito per la sua scarsa aderenza al tema e per l'infelice scelta del titolo a fronte di un'ambientazione napoletana. Il gioco però è un tipico piazzamento scooter (ops lavoratori) con gestione pizze (ops risorse). Un paio di meccaniche incrociate e un 'asta comunque originale rendono questo gioco a mio avviso apprezzabile anche se non un capolavoro.

Papa Paolo is a game about delivering pizza. Players draft tiles from a grid board that have houses to deliver to. Alternatively, you can perform special actions, whose effectiveness is determined by your tech track, to do things like get money or buy ingredients. Majorities in the rows and columns of the grid can yield some bonus money. Then, there's an Amun-Re style auction to determine both how many pizzas you can deliver and how far you can deliver them, as well as tech track advances. There's a lot of mechanisms here, but it all fits together. The game was fun, but nothing special.

Worker placement delivery game. All about delivering your pizza! I love the theme, I can't help it. I LOVE pizza! :D There is an interesting bidding mechanic each round. Having play this first game I know I will do things differently next time. Tie breaker is most money... Ron and I tied so this is very important to know. Actually the scores were pretty close and it is not necessarily a good thing. I definitely enjoyed my play and want to play again.

This game was ok. Good, not great. The rulebook was quite poor, and the components are needlessly hard to read. The game itself is a little messy, but not bad.

Essentially, there is a grid of tiles. On your turn you place a worker on a space in that grid, then either add the tile to your tableau, or you resolve one of the up to 2 actions that are printed at the ends of the tile grid. For the most part the actions are either get money, spend money for pizza tokens, pay money to insta deliver some pizzas to empty house spots in your tableau, or build another pizzeria location tile in your tableau.

Once everyone has placed their workers, players bid for tiles that will determine how many pizzas they can deliver, and how far they can trace their delivery path away from their pizzaria tiles. Whomever gets the worst of these tiles, then becomes the new starting player.

In general, I enjoyed building my little city, and I enjoyed the process of tracing the delivery routes. When a tile is fully supplied, you get a bump on the tech track of the matching colored house. The tracks give you extra effectiveness when you resolve your other actions. 

One big flaw to the game however, is that while each player has a marker for the turn order track, once starting player is assigned based on who did worst in the auction, turn order is then simply set clockwise from that person, meaning the player in the lead could wind up going second due to seating arrangement. The game was amusing enough, but despite improving your techs, it never really feels like you are building to anything special. Each turn feels pretty much the same, with the slight variation offered by randomness in terms of which tiles are available when you are done making pizzas and are ready to start adding new tiles to your board.

I would play this again, but I'm not super anxious to.

[u]The Positive[/u]
(+) The game pops with beautiful box and board art full of lively colors and bustling with humoristic details. The components are cute and a lot of fun to play with (pizza boxes with italian stickers on them, delivery scooter pawns, ...).

(+) The theming of the game blends well with the mechanics: you try to deliver as many pizza's to as many houses as possible, improving your skills as you go. This makes the game accessible, easy to understand and fun to play.

(+) There are some neat mechanics implemented in this game, offering interesting choices all of the time. The game engine revolves around a 4x4 tile grid with streets and colored houses on the tiles. Players need those 'town districts' to build up the neighborhood around their pizzeria(s), in order to get their pizza's delivered. Having delivered pizza to each house on a tile gives the player a skill-upgrade: do you choose tiles with many houses so you can deliver many pizza's close to your pizzeria (ensuring many points), or tiles with few houses to increase skill-upgrading speed? It is also possible to neglect the chosen tile in the grid and perform one of the 2 base actions related to the selected grid spot (2 out of 4 possible actions: obtain cash, bake pizza's, express delivery or open a new pizzeria). What's more, at the edge of the grid there are gold coins blinking and there is a majority thing going on in the rows and columns of the grid, with the coins going to the player best represented in the corresponding row or column of the grid at the end of the round. You need money to bake pizza's, make express deliveries, open new pizzeria's and bid on means for regular delivery at the end of the round. Easy but varied mechanics (worker placement, tile placement and bidding) with only four base actions, but they invite players to think things through and to plan ahead.

(+) The game is quick to explain and quick to play. The five rounds are over in about 90 minutes in a 4-player game. The gameflow is smooth with little downtime (some limited downtime is possible when a player is thinking what spot to choose in the tiles grid - but this is totally acceptable).

(+) The game will be different from game to game depending on which city tiles come out early (many houses mean slower progress on the skill-tracks, different colored houses boost different type of skills, ...). This way, one game can see a lot of money getting into the game if lots of tiles with one yellow house come into play early and the next game can have very little. This increases replayability.

[u]The Negative[/u]
(-) The colored houses on the tiles are not always very clear (especially some red and yellow houses). This is a minor annoyance, the game material is generally very good and the game is perfectly playable. Colorblind friends will get challenged, but for them each type of colored house also as a non-color related 'hint' (example: yellow houses have windows, green houses have satellite dishes, red houses have antenna's, ...).

(-) I admit I don't have enough experience with this game to put this point down as a real disadvantage, so let me put it as a 'concern' which may be elevated with more play-experience. My concern is that, when played right, scoring might always come down to more or less the same end score with turn order becoming very important in your chances for victory. Let me explain: you have 20 (maybe max 25)actions/tiles to use in this game and with only 4 base actions you will find yourself cycling through a logical sequence of actions (make sure you have money to pay actions and bid on delivery equipment, make sure you have pizza's, make sure you expand your neighbourhood with enough houses, deliver pizza's (express and/or standard delivery)). A major component in scoring is number of pizza's delivered, and honestly - chances are big that each player will take more or less the same number of tiles and obtain more or less the same number of houses to deliver to in the course of the game, unless they really screw up. Further points can be gained by boosting your skills, but those skill tracks also move up by delivering pizza's and each player gets the chance to boost one skill at the end of each round (so not a big difference to be made here either). If this concern proves to be valid, this might mean that the end scores with minimally skilled players will often be very close to each other and the final score can feel a little predetermined with a significant advantage for players who have often been early in turn order (statistically granting them the more interesting spots in the tile grid, allowing for superior action and tile optimalization). For this reason, I would advise to only play the variant in which turn order gets determined by bidding on delivery equipment (not simply the standard clock-wise gameplay!). If this problem gets confirmed, this might cause me to lose interest and reduce replayability.

[u]Conclusion[/u]
Papà Paolo is a sweet, lively and playful game bursting of atmosphere. It is a medium-weight very accessible euro game revolving around a tile/action grid which ties together different type of mechanics to create an interesting gaming experience, striking a balance between strategic and tactical play. With a smooth gameflow and a very reasonable play time the game does not outstay its welcome. My only real concern with the game is that I can not (yet?) rule out the possibility that due to the way the game works an important part of the end score is 'predetermined', unless players really screw up for some reason. Significant extra skill in playing this game might only score you marginally more points, while the effect of turn order might cause more significant point differences, resulting in an undesired situation in which skillful play doesn't get sufficiently reflected in game scoring. Please note that this point of critisism is susceptible to change ([i]maybe there are also strategies possible in which players getting a lot of money bid on the end of round tiles in order to deliver extra pizza's (via express-delivery or an extra bake pizza's action), breaking out of the classical patern (obtaining money, obtaining tiles with houses, baking pizza's, making deliveries) resulting in more or less the same end score each time you play[/i]) - but for now I'm not convinced that after multiple plays the game will offer ways for experienced players to improve their scores. Nevertheless, this concern has not been proven just yet, and for now I must say that based on the tons of interesting mechanics and the charming atmosphere, the developers clearly put a lot of love and thought into this little game with a big heart!

[u]Tips for those going in:[/u]
(*) Play strategically with an eye on which skills you plan to improve and often use first. For example: Having a lot of money and making express deliveries can be powerful if you combine it with an early investment in red houses and a good connected steet-layout with lots of loops in your neigbourhood. Another example: if you invest heavily into baking pizza's, it would be logical to try to take tiles with many houses as close to your pizzeria as possible in order to deliver more.
(*) Keep an eye on your overall strategy when selecting grid spaces, but also play tactical: maybe another spot in the grid renders similar results, but nets you some much needed coins, or it takes away the possibility for your opponent to bake pizza's this round?
(*) Try to get the maximum out of every action you get: you only have 20 - 25 actions. When baking pizza's, bake enough! When placing tiles, try to think ahead how your delivery round will work.
(*) If you plan to build streets in all directions around your pizzeria, invest in the green skill so you can deliver in multiple directions.
(*) Always play with the variant in which turn order for each player is determined by bidding at the end of the round (not simply clock-wise!). I expect the game to be much more interesting that way!

Slightly fiddly worker-placement game that has a gorgeous central mechanic in which you have to trade off taking actions against building your board.  The theme is amusing and there's decent tension involved in getting your timing and placements correct.  
It's possible that a couple of bad or unlucky decisions on round 1 could effectively rule you out of the game without that becoming apparent until too late, but that's hardly a problem unique to this game!  And the grid system means that everyone should get something they want whilst still being able to swear at others for their choices...
Generally, this is a game that will be liked by people who like this sort of game.  I wouldn't use it as an introduction to the genre but I'd certainly rate it amongst the better entries.

With a gorgeous art (not a strange thing if you have the artist from 'Dungeon Lords' and 'Dungeon Petz', albeit without the huge amount of humour those fantastic games depict in their boards and components) what has truly captivated me about this game is its combination of different mechanics, how fast can it become once you have grasped them and that constant feeling of not being able to get to the end of the round as you would like to that is so "Agricolalike".

Papa Paolo is a game about delivering pizzas. There's three main phases of the game: action/tile selection, bidding for delivery tiles and pizza delivery.

In the first phase you place your workers on a grid. The spot you place on determines either the tile you take (the one there) or the action you take (either of the two actions on the row or column... this also flushes the tile that was there btw). You must choose one or the other. Additionally each row and column has a majority contest for bonus coins (1-3). Being closer to the coin breaks ties. So deciding which tiles you need, which actions you need and trying to work the area majority into that is a tough little puzzle.

Actions include making pizzas (buying ingredients actually), making a speedy delivery (flying pizzas out to one of your tiles) and taking a money action. How well you do these things depends on your development chart. Later on when you deliver pizzas to the matching colored houses on a tile (and completely fill that tile's houses with pizzas) you'll get to bump you your stat for that action's color on the development chart. Blue increases how many pizzas you make, yellow makes your money actions more profitable, red increases how many speedy deliveries you can make, and green lets you have more than one delivery guy. Some tracks require multiple bumps before they start paying off.

After that phase is resolved, there's a bidding round. There's enough delivery tiles out for every player to get one, but they vary in how many routes you can take and how many pizza's you can carry. You have to place your worker on a bid spot. If you overbid someone they have to move to a new spot... but they have to move to a horizontally adjacent bid (which is usually a buck higher or lower) or bid higher. This makes for painful bidding situations where you get outbid for the thing you want but still are committed to paying a lot of money for a tile you didn't really want. After getting a tile, you also get to tyake a bump on one of your development stats, but each stat can only be triggered by one player, so if you really wanted to bump green and someone else gets to it first, you'll have to pick something else.

Finally you deliver your pizzas and take the money for them. Then you rinse and repeat for a couple of rounds. The way you score is according to your lowest development track, kind of a knizia scoring thing, less any undelivered pizzas, and a bonus if you maxed out any delivery track.

The action/tile selection mechanism was the best part of the game. The rest of the game wasn't quite as good, but was still enjoyable. Unfortunately the game is marred by a number of design issues, most notably that it can be hard to make out the features on tiles.

Build a neighbourhood and deliver pizzas to houses. Actions are selected on a grid followed by an auction for pizza orders.

Lots of things going on from tile placement to auction bidding.  Medium weight Euro.

I love the theme and artwork. The mechanics are nothing new but OK although they didn't always connected with the theme (you don't get money for delivering pizza's but you get free money from an action). The design of the tiles are poorly done though. The coloured houses aren't always very clear, they don't 'pop' out.
HOWEVER, despite these quirks it's a pretty good game.

Worker placement and tile placement.  Pizzerias in Naples compete for largest market share. Distinctive aspects are found in the 3x3 action grid that doubles as a tic-tac-toe area control row/column mini-puzzle. Also distinctive is the tile placement of city blocks on your neighborhood player board and perhaps the first pizzeria tech tree.  Lots of stickering if you are inclined--me, not a big fan.

We had the opportunity to try this game in Cordoba. It was a prototype copy but I believe it was really close to the Verkami release version that will be out very soon.

I am afraid that my table didn´t enjoy it very much.
We were hoping to find some fresh mechanics in the game but we found re implementations of mechanics borrowed from other games (standard drafting, role selection, worker placement, etc).

We found the mix of mechanics too confusing and you didn´t feel like you were playing a whole game but many unconnected mini games.
These mini games are not very well connected between each other and most of the time you feel like you are drafting for the card that will affect your desired mini game and that is it.

Most of the roles (cards in the draft) have a free automatic ability and a choice between two activated abilities that have little interaction with other players.
There are 9 cards in the draft so that adds up to almost 27 different abilities that you need to know about. The drawings and icons that are meant to help you understand them are small and a little bit counter-intuitive so is hard to keep track of what is going on when you are new to the game.

The game board is a little bit saturated and it has small drawings that would look cool printed in a card but don´t work great as icons or tiles because the detail is too small.

I don´t  usually add comments in BGG but we felt so differently when compared with other people that had added comments to this thread that we felt that it is just fair to have everone´s opinion in here.

Bottom line: The people that demonstrated the game to us were very nice and friendly! Double thumbs up for them!! :)

Despues de probar el juego , creo que hay mecánicas que no están del todo pulidas y opciones más óptimas que otras, con lo que incita a elegir una opción más que otra.
Además, bajo mi opinión las acciones de los personajes no son muy intuitivas y el juego en si no es del todo muy fluido.
En cuanto al número de jugadores , debe de ser de 4 para que todas las opciones estén balanceadas. 
Lamentablemente no cubre las expectativas puestas en él.

Played as a close to final prototipe (rules, not graphics nor materials).  Relatively complex game, with role selection mechanism.  Quite a few paths to score points, seems well balanced.  A bit too complex for my personal taste, to me it was not easy to really remember who was doing what, since each character has two actions and some even a third one.  Once you get this feeling and really get the different areas in the board, the game offers quite a lot.

Very good game, looking forward to back it on verkami's crowdfunding website.

*update*

Backed.

*update*

Played the final version and it has been polished in some minor details, now the game comes from very good to great. 

On the other hand, the rulebook is a little bad organized in my opinion and first play can drag a little too much because of some rules checking is needed and they are hard to find. But all efforts are going to be whorthy at last.

Incredible good game. OK, it's another point salad but I prefer it, for example, over its contemporary Mombasa because I feel more real impact with my decisions. 

I hope Plus Ultra gets to a wider audience soon, it deserves it.

Played in 2014 as jury in award Zona Ludica. Very good game with role-put-worker mechanics. Not complex but very funny to play

A very good underground eurogame, with a touch of oldschool euro. This game  is in the vein of "Whats your game", "Hans in gluck!" companies. 
If you like the true form of eurogame try "Plus Ultra". I think that it is a little hidden gem.

The theme is well represented, there are many actions to choose from and therefore paths to victory.  I like that it is not easy to predict final scoring positions far in advance.

Solid game. We find the rules too complicated but otherwise a fun and competitive game with well implemented mechanics.

This is a rock solid game: elegant, thematic, fast, not complicated but complex. It's well balanced, but not in an inert way. Lots of interaction! Several strategic choices with tension.
I particularly love the historical theme, vivid simulation of the reign of Emperor Charles V. It really reminds me the movie "1492: Conquest of Paradise".

Positives: 

- small box with a lot of game in it. I wish more games were space compact like this one. 
-  theme is fun, a lot of roles you can choose. 
-  I like the hidden new world track that you can explore. 
- A lot of mini games, reminds me of Trajan. Helps with the theme, but many of them feel pasted on for theme sake. 
- secretary of states character card looks exactly like Will Forte in ‘last man on earth’, including the large eyebrows. Hard to tell if this was done intentionally but I had a good laugh.

Negatives: 

- Too many weak mini games. Magellans voyage and the painter do not work in two player games. They don’t feel strategic at all. It is just “Do this five times amd win points”. Building the church also never happened in our game. There were never enough tiles in the market for anyone to bother. 
- The rule book is the worst I have ever seen. It looks like it was translated from Spanish by goggle translate. Wrong words (besides) , extra words, made up words, (‘bidden’?) bad sentence structure adds to confusion, and the organization is a total mess with almost nothing in a logical space.
- too many choices. Not only do you have 15 character cards with 3 options each, there is a common action pool with another 8 options. Some are definitely pasted on and much weaker than others.
- we played two players, which is not optimal. I can imagine this game with 4 players will take a long time to play. Some options, like Magellan’s voyage, building the church, are hard to get done in a two player game if one decides not to participate.
- Three lines of card power icons (with up to five icons in one line!) are often explained in reverse order in the rules from how they are listed on the card so I spent a lot of time staring at icon lines and wondering why they weren’t where they were supposed to be. I spent my first game completely buried in the bad rules looking for answers. 
- Making this worse is that the game has zero presence on bgg and youtube so you can’t look up answers, or even find a decent play-through in English because no one has bought the game. I have never owned a game in 25 years with so little info on it. It has been completely forgotten. This is really perplexing since this is a Euro game that seems to tick a lot of boxes that people would enjoy so either they did not promote it properly or they didn’t make enough copies, or they didn’t care about the English audience. The only saving grace is that a bgg user made a good player aid for it, which really should have been included by the original publisher. 
- I was so frustrated by the bad rules, I offered to clean them up for free, but I am now thinking this is not worth my time, as it is also badly organized and could take days of rewrites. This is really not the customers job. If there was a large English speaking audience for the game, it might be worth doing, but no one cares about this game on bgg. I subscribe to it and no one has posted anything new in it for a year. It has barely 15 entries in the forum, total. 
-  I probably won’t get a chance for a second play as my gaming partner called it her “least favorite of the last ten games we played”. This practically guarantees that I will never get it to the table again. And I can see that I will have a hard time even selling this for $15 since nobody cares about the game or knows about it. 
- Severe iconitis. There are way too many hard to fathom icons on the cards and this is slows the game a lot. My wife was just randomly choosng cards because they were not easy to decipher and no player aids were included. She constantly asked me “what does this one do?” Then, for the 30th time, I had to look it up in the rules. Nothing kills a game faster than not understanding the cards you hold, which is the main mechanism of the game. My wife got very annoyed and was quickly bored with the game. And we were only in the third round! This leads to another problem. 

- To say this icon reading gets easier with more games is possible, but the chances of having a second game after this experience are almost zero because of this bad first experience. And remember that I am the one who studied the rules and explained the game. It was a LOT of work, and then very disappointed to find your partner is bored and frustrated because neither of us can decipher the cards. We only played with the base characters so you can imagine how hard it’s going to be once you add in another six characters from the expansions. I don’t think I would ever attempt this. 


I am glad that I at least only paid $14 (and free shipping!) for this game as my store finally dumped off all their copies that were in their inventory for two years, (regular price $50) It really needs a complete rewrite of the rule book and more detailed explanations on the cards, with larger icons, or more text descriptions.  If there is a lesson to be learned here it is that a rushed rulebook, too many icons, too many options, can hurt a game.  Other problem is that I will probably have to give this game away as nobody is interested in even paying $10 for it.

Fourteen characters to choose from each turn---which ones will best fulfill your strategy?  This enmeshes with an auction-style worker placement involving sending regiments into the European wars to make this game a standout. Each turn you contemplate settling colonies, supporting the church, the level of belligerence in Europe, and backing Magellan's voyage, among other things.  Paths to victory? Could be a dozen, will take many plays to truly know. Nice depth and complexity.

Mecenas Verkami. No daba un duro por el juego y esta bien, lastima que algunas expansiones no funcionan a dos
Y tiene acciones de "relleno" como el pintor de palacio

RATING: 6
Not the most innovative game, as it is another tile-laying, area control, with limited actions, but there are some difficult/interesting decisions to be made, and it plays well with 2.  The theme is fairly thin, but still adds to the game somewhat.

I like this, BUT:

it's very long due to the AP that almost every turn necessitates
for a two hour game you could be having as much fun elsewhere
I'm not sure how replayable it is.

If you've never played this, I suppose Carcassone and Fjords have a surface similarity - but this is much more cerebral (three or four times more so).  That could be a big plus!

I played it with 3 and that was about as many people as I think I'd like to play it with.  Any more and the downtime for thinking through each move would just become painful.  Hey maybe you could play Bison against the clock...but then again part of the charm of this is its critical decision making and if you try to play it fast it would lose that strength.

Buen juego de control de mayorías. Muy feo en su presentación, los tableros son oscuros y tristes, pero el juego deja buen sabor de boca. A más partidas que vamos jugando descubrimos nuevas posibilidades al juego, que sin ser el mejor de su género, cumple con un notable bajo. Por otro lado es fácil encontrarlo en alemán por menos de 10 euros, y con su pequeña caja lo llevamos a donde haga falta.

RATING: 7
This game is quite good for what it aspires to be.  It has nice tile laying decisions, good area majority decisions, good resource engine building decisions, good player prediction questions, and like Hansa Teutonica and El Grande, difficult decisions about bringing in additional pieces from "off the board" (in this case purchasing/trading resources for new pieces).  

We played our first game with the variant that allows you to upgrade and build canoes as many times as you are able to on a single canoe action (same with teepees and teepee actions).  This made the game more interesting I think, and yes, more challenging.

I think this game initially received lower BGG numbers than it deserved because its box is small and it did not have all the glitzy production values of the mask series.  Yes, these things are true, and yes, I do wish the tiles were nicer, both in shape and appearance, BUT this game is solid, even brilliant, on its own terms, and deserves to be in at least the top 500 on BGG.

It plays to me like a mix of Carcassonne, Trias, El Grande, Tikal & Cavum, all games that I ahem...enjoy.  April 2013.  8 of 10.

Second game, I am not quite as impressed.  Lowering to a 7.  July 2013.

I SOOOOOOOOOOOO want to LOVE this game. The theme of the praries is integrated fairly well and not so well at the same time. For the Kramer & Kiesling fans it's a MUST as the resource mechanic to manage your action points in amazing! However somehow the gameplay comes up a tad dry and finding people who like to play such a game is hard to find unless you have just the right group.

I sold this game to a friend who only owned Settlers.

This is one of the weakest games of Kramer/Kiesling; after Celtica again a minor game. Although it looks like it has the potential of their fantastic triology (Tikal/Java/Mexica) it is for some reason not that good. You haven't that much possibilities, because you may not play twice the same action, and that's a pity. Secondly the board looks a bit unclear. And third, with four players, there's not a lot of time to go in a confrontation with one of the other players; mostly a third player is the lucky dog when you do it anyway. I heard variant 1 is better, but I didn't play it yet.

RATING: 5
Too bad the small box and bland components are not as appealing as say Tikal, especially since Bison is perhaps the better game.  A quick fix is to substitute the wooden cubes for meeples!  One other negative is that my tiles are all slightly warped, so the card stock should have been thicker.

Bison is similar to Caylus, for the timing of your actions is key!  I love that players only perform 1 action at a time and that each of these actions can only be performed once per round.  My favorite is the "Hunter gathering" action.  I also love that the animal tracks reset to zero before the final scoring.  Otherwise a player could simply perform no actions involving hunters and just move up the animal tracks to 15.

The main downside to Bison is that it does feature a random tile draw and that there may be a turn order advantage.  I recommend playing with the official variants in the rulebook.  Players may now enlarge and/or reduce any number of Teepees or Canoes.

Update: The random tile draw and turn order advantage are a huge downside.

A worthy addition to the K/K pantheon of action-restricted majority games.

Somewhat of a different take on area control games that I have played.  I liked it and it worked well with two.

Dec 2012 - Bumped up to a 7.5.  A tough resource mangement game.  Played with three and it was tight all the way through.  It reminded me a Carc: the Castle just a touch where the only time you add people to the board is when you lay a tile.  Your hunters are limited so you have to build canoes and teepees to bring them back into the fold to place them again.  You have three foods that are the resources you use for everything.  The area control part earns you food back and at the end of the game, a final count of the food you gather is what your score it.  We were pleasantly surprised by the game.

Kinda boring.  Mostly annoying.  1 play, basic rules.  Most plays seem obvious.  The 4 random tiles you get during the course of the game have a major impact on your success.  There shouldn't be tiles with only 1 type of animal (i.e. 3 turkey or 3 fish)... there should be at least 2 types of animals on the tiles so that the person placing the tile cannot suck up all of the good stuff.  Maybe this game would improve if players started with all of the tiles they would use for the entire game.  It takes a long time to build up anything in this game, and often other players can jump your claim pretty easily.  It's annoying that you cannot build multiple teepees or canoes on a given turn in the basic game.

Liked it much more than I thought I would! Bit dry, but very clever mechanics, take control of various hunting grounds - holding grounds gives you food, but you need to spend it to take more.

Poor start might be hard to recover from, but it's short so that's forgiveable.

** update - seems a significant play order advantage, going later in the last turn is good, going first is bad ... :(

The game is too restricting. Not a lot of good choices to what you can do. If another player comes along and screws you, there is very little opportunity to react. The limited ability to introduce new hunters onto the board is frustrating. Definitely didn't like the last round scoring from zero.

Very surprising that this came from the same authors of Maharaja, which is one of my favourite games.

A nice little area control game that plays very well with 2.  Having to clear the scoreboard and score the final score after the last turn is over is a great idea, and really levels the playing field, preventing a runaway leader and making the endgame tense.  I like the theme too.  Nothing mind-blowing, but a good little game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Interesting, challenging Kiesling & Kramer "action-allocation" abstract game on a small scale. The only random events or information come from the tiles themselves, which make up quite a bit of your strategy as to when and where you place them. Having only four actions is very limiting, and leaves you with some tough decisions to make. Often the game comes down to that crucial final turn (which is essentially the only turn that matters for scoring). Great two-player game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Not at all what I expected.  A decent game, but nothing that blew me away.  I would gladly play it again.  It is a bit of a brain burner trying to look at where all the scoring is taking place.  Although it didn't happen too much in our game, I could see this suffering from "analysis paralysis".

I liked Bison. The action point system is very Kramer-ish, and with its "reserve" vs "ready" pools, growing board, and different types of areas, it actually has significant similarities in feel to the classic El Cabellero. It's not anything that's going to set your world alight, but it's a nice "heavier" Carcassonne or "lighter" El Cabellero. The endgame scoring is clever; during the game, you need some balance between the three food sources (fish, turkeys, bison) to get at your reserve pieces, but at the end of the game, though, you just count up the total of what you've got.

But, it's a game that needs to proceed at a reasonable pace. In one game I played, one of the players just totally locked up, the game proceeded at a crawl, and it was bad. In that way, it's not dissimilar to Tikal or Torres or the other "Kramer action point" games. The analytical problems are not that hard, and nor do they need to be explored in great detail to play well, but some players will feel compelled to grossly over-analyze. It's not technically the game's fault, people should really know better than that, but the game provides more encouragement than it should.

Interesting game this and will need to review my rating after more plays. Using animals to feed your indians allows them to perform several different actions that ultimately earn you more animals. the player at the end of the game who has the biggest combined totals of Bison, Turkey and Fish is the winner.

Reading back my original comment dating from—at the time of writing—well over two years ago, I admit to being a little puzzled over it. Yes, Bizon is a rather standard majority game with a few cute twists. The graphics are not as contrasting as one would hope, although good light will go a good way to solve that problem. The most annoying aspect is the 'waviness' of it all which makes it difficult to see where areas begin and end. I suspect it was a combination of the latter aspect and a not-too great rules explanation which soured me on this title.

Forward to the time I'm writing now. The publisher organised a sale during which I was able to get this title for a very agreeable price, and so could attempt the game anew. I liked it a lot better than way back when, mostly because I understood what needed to be done. It's actually a bit more clever than meets the eye because of the fact that you cannot simply dump influence cubes at will: you are restricted to the tile you place to bring fresh ones into play. That means you will easily drain your stock of animals in getting hunters to the fields, but if you [i]don't[/i] use them as planned, you'll be having trouble the next round. Quite the balancing act. Yes, it's a simple-looking game, but to play it well requires a bit of brains! So... apart from the design, which admittedly could be better, what was not to like again?

[b]Update[/b]   With 2 players, this game is too much tit for tat to be interesting: a well-known problem in majority games. The rating is 4 at best in this case.

[b]Update 2[/b]   I decided that despite its good central ideas on how the majority mechanism should function, the execution really was putting me off from bringing this to the table. It's a shame, but sometimes this sort of thing seems to happen. So I sold it off, with some regrets.

Components: Chunky wooden cubes and cool teepee/canoe tiles. The landscape tiles warp a bit, preventing them from laying entirely flat. They are a strange shape, fitting together in an interesting way, but I didn't like the artwork, which seemed almost photorealistic. I would have preferred something more cartoonish, like there is for the teepees and canoes.

Experience: This game felt like hard work, like balancing my monthly budget. There were tough decisions along the way, but they weren't fun to make. It costs so much food and so many actions to move a hunter from the market to my supply, to deploy them to the board, to move a teepee from the market to my supply, to convert the hunter to a teepee, and then do it all over again to upgrade the teepee; it just wasn't fun.

There could have been some tense battles for control over regions, but it was too difficult to mobilize my hunters for the skirmishes to be fun. Also, to do all that work but only end up with as much food as I started with was disappointing; my poor hunters were barely subsisting.

I definitely like having six actions, and being able to use four of them in any order; I'd like to see that used in another Kramer/Kiesling venture.

Players lay tiles containing fish, turkeys and buffalo, then attempt to achieve majorities over the food sources.  Players play tiles to expand the ever growing board, bit like Carcassonne, then take alternate actions.  Actions deploy hunters onto the board, then move them around and turn them into teepees/canoes.  At the end of each turn, food is awarded based on who has the most influence on the different food areas.  Food is both victory points and money to deploy pieces onto the board.  Not a terrible game, but rather ugly to look at and nothing original at all.  The turkey is rather apt.

Bison is a much bigger and much better game than is suggested by its small box, low price and modest BGG rating.  It mixes area majority and tile placement nicely, and the odd shaped tiles are an interesting point of difference.  Works well with 2 players.

Lots of familiar mechanics packaged into a nice blend.  The tiles are pretty neat although the map looks increasingly like something Dali would have drawn from the sky while being completely wasted.  Since the terrains do not have to match, the sudden changes from plains to hills looks awkward.  Contrary to popular belief, one does not need a balanced diet to win.  To wit, those sturdy indians feasted on salmon, buffalo and turkey.  Most never had a bowel movement in their entire life.

A 60 minute brain burner with enough twists to keep it interesting. Not your standard area majority game since, for example, a single value 2 tepee would beat 3 value 1 tepees and 6 hunters. It's all about timing and managing your "money" to be able to upgrade at the right time. So far I've only played as a 2 player game, and I can see where it would probably be even better with more. Great game.

A very original majority game, a lot more strategical than most others of the genre. The goal here is to generate a good "revenue" since the scores are reset at the beginning of the last turn. This is strangely reminiscent of bigger management games such as, say, Age of Steam. To support this, the game moves more slowly than typical majority games: majorities are hard to take over and second and third players still get an interesting revenue. Strategical pawn placement plays a key role.

RATING: 6
Bison is a fairly standard area control game. It takes a lot of mechanisms known from other Kramer/Kiesling games and combines them in slightly different ways (action points, majority scoring, tile laying). Players are restricted on where to place their tribesmen, and since movement is also rather limited (and costly) the only luck factor in the game, tile drawing, has a much bigger influence than I would like. The board also becomes rather messy towards the end of the game, and since there is only one VP scoring round turn order has a huge impact.

The double K's offer up another action point game here, and add tile placement.  I can understand the negative comments as far as just being tired with an areas majority game, but any attacks against actual game play miff me. I find Bison plays quickly and smoothly.  AP is always an issue in these types of games, and maybe it can bog down with some having to be aware of three terrains and resources, but things are rather clear on th board and so i agree with Chris Farrell when he suggests this is more a player issue.  Optimization is key, along with timing - when and which way best to perform an action.  The scoring is interesting, and opens up a lot of different ways to attack solving the resource battles.  Sometimes third is better than second, although it most likely ties up needed hunters.  Bisons offers the ability to change the values of areas by adding tiles, so you never feel locked out of a game deciding territory.  I believe Bisons offers a quick, medium weight challenge that is underrated here on the geek.

I'll reserve final judgment on this until I've played by the right rules--when I playtested Bison, we were each using all our action points per turn all in one go (Tikal style), rather than rotating around the table.  Nonetheless, this feels like a pretty strong area control game.  I did find the board to be a bit chaotic; one cannot simply glance at it and immediately grasp the spheres of influence for each player.  I thought the theme of the game was reasonably well connected to the mechanics, about as well as one can expect for an abstract area control game.

Nothing special here. A game board that develops and becomes sore to the eye to try and see where everything is and then calculate it all.

Just another worker placement, area majority game with a tacked on theme. I never felt like a hunter/gatherer. I just felt like I was pushing cubes around and waiting for it to end.

It's a shame. I was really hoping to like this one, as I've always wanted to try it, but it just fell flat and is now on the trade list.

I hate to say it, but I'd rather play Carcassonne, which has already been traded away.

In some ways I enjoyed this, but nothing about it really jumped out at me.  This game contains classic Kramer goodness, but the game is pretty abstract and the artwork is pretty drab.  If you want a good Kramer game where you can never quite do everything you want in a turn, there are far better options out there.  On a positive note, this game is very compact, and I get the impression that it scales well, so that is certainly something to consider.  Not a bad game, but there are others.

A kind of reduced to the max game about area control with majorities. If you like Mykerinos you may like this too even the games do not have much in common but serve the same target group of simple and low luck games with more tactics and strategy. However the graphical artwork is not that exciting, but for every once and while it's an OK game.

Somehow I believe this will become one of the either really obscure games or a collectors item, it suffers from a simple flaw, the last player usually has the opportunity to win most of the time.

It's a bit ironically sad that Kramer and Kiesling get a cold reception when they deliver a family game in a big box, and now the same for a gamer's game in a small box. Indeed, this is a much heavier game than one would usually expect from the size of the box. Tile laying, resource management, moving your cubes and blocking your opponents, upgrading your pieces, scoring regions... There is a lot to do and to think about, especially if you use the official variants. The tiles have an interesting shape, but the artwork could have brighter colors. I would also have appreciated better-looking hunter pieces instead of the overused wooden cubes.

a huge surprise. It got a rating of 8.0 after the first play. Really fun area majority game. Fresh. Excellent mechanisms. I like that in some cases 3rd and 4th might score more then 2nd. I think it adds an interesting twist to have to keep ion mind. The only think keeping it from a 9.0 is I wish it wasn't all scored based on your last actions in the game.

Great and completely underrated game. Yeah, it may not win the "show of innovation", but how many games do anyway? Point is, that this comes in a small box and is still able to play much bigger games to the wall.

The actions and their sequence play a huge role, specially as each action can only be activated once per round. I can see this being dry for some people, but I like it the way it is and find the theme and gameplay (the way known mechanics work together here) somewhat fresh.

It's not a game you need to own or know, but it doesn't have to hide behind Kramer & Kiesling's big box games, though.

I'm a big Kramer and Kiesling fan -- so I pretty much love everything that I've played so far that's come out from the two of them. This little gem of an area control game also has interesting (yet not overly complex) interlocking mechanics that help distinguish it from others. It has the tile laying aspect that we have seen in Kramer's earlier El Cabellero, but the placement becomes less cut-throat when you consider that the 'dudes on the map' can move around. Overall, a great game for both 3 and 4 -- while it is also good with 2, there's a serious snowball effect that can occur (and no 2 vs. 1 balancing effect).

[b]COLLECT AS MUCH ANIMALS AS POSSIBLE, AVOID LEAVING THEM ALONE AND SAVE FOR THE WINTER[/b]

Clearly, Bison: Thunder on the Prairie is an underestimated game. It may look weak and boring, but after a few turns and games, it may start catching on, especially when played with more than two players.

Strategies and tactics go deep within the very limited game board, which interestingly enough, is being built as the game progresses, much like Carcassonne. However, said profoundness may be annoying for some players who approach the game as a somewhat simple and easy kind of game, when in reality, is much more than that. “Bison” is a rough diamond, with lots of defects on the outside, but on the inside, it’s a fairly good game, even mind-daring, especially during the last turns of the game.

Granted, the theme is not exactly that which arouses the interest of many players, but it is only accidental. It could do great with many other themes, so I admit it’s not a great choice. I’m merely holding on to the mechanism.

Without a second thought, I would most definitely play this game again, but only sometimes though. It’s not a game easily accepted and embraced by "Carcassonne and Settlers" players, but it sure is a great game for the collection of more modular board experienced gamers.

Recommended, but it's a bit too expensive. When buying it, it’s a good idea to consider this game was created by Wolfgang Kramer and Michael Kiesling, the minds behind Tikal.

[b][i]II. Sliders[/i][/b]

Abstract [b]__[COLOR=#FF0000][3][/COLOR]_______[/b] Themed: As previously mentioned, the whole American Indians is not the best theme the designers could’ve picked, and I would really digsagree with anyone stating that the whole theme is the very core and essence of the game. I think that a more “approachable” theme or symbology could do better for the game, For example, maybe replacing the theme of Indians with cavemen or Ancient Civilization’s earlier beginnings could be a more suitable theme. Also, replacing some of the animals with minerals, plants or other things important to young civilizations may be a very good idea. But still, we may never understand why Bison is about American Indians.

Simple [b]______[COLOR=#FF0000][7][/COLOR]___[/b] Complex: The rulebook, though extensive and sometimes way too interested in showing certain situations in the game instead of actually explaining the situations or solving certain issues, is a very nice work, but still short from a good rulebook. Some of the players to whom I’ve introduced “Bison” have complained over the unnecessary complexity of the rulebook, and on a mutual agreement, have decided to “skip” certain rules when playing the game. Surprisingly enough, disregarding some rules have resulted in the game being more accepted and even faster, without compromising the core mechanics and turn flow.

Strategic [b]___[COLOR=#FF0000][4][/COLOR]______[/b] Tactical: The possibility of “colonizing” or “taking” some of the “hunting grounds” shown on the various board pieces as they appear, allows the players to relax their grip on every animal they see and plan a few steps ahead of their current turn, possibly delving into some effective strategic game play. However, tactical game play is also a very effective and fast way to play “Bison”, which makes the whole game appealing to both types of gamers. Combining both ways, in my personal opinion, is not a very good idea though.
 
Luck [b]_______[COLOR=#FF0000][8][/COLOR]__[/b] Skill: Other than drawing a certain board piece may be good or better for you or your opponents, “Bison” has little to no luck involved. Skill and action management, as well as administration of animals/money is the core of the entire game. For short, no board piece you can draw is bad for you. They are just "good or better" for you.

Fiddly [b]____[COLOR=#FF0000][5][/COLOR]_____[/b] Elegant: The “Bison” rulebook is both a blessing and a curse. If you’re a “rules lawyer” kind of gamer, you’ll probably think this game is too fiddly and you’ll turn into a “let’s not do that instead” kind of gamer, in which case, the game is a lot less fiddly, but not elegant enough to call it “elegant”. There’s too much confusion and lack of term precision in the rulebook, and the graphic examples within it, though sometimes helpful, can’t make up for its defects.
 
Indirect interaction [b]___[COLOR=#FF0000][4][/COLOR]______[/b] Direct interaction: The most interaction players get in “Bison” is the kind of interaction you get in race games, in the sense that, once a good board piece is revealed, the players will most likely race to get for themselves as much of it as possible. Other than that, players are usually much more calm and focused on their respective player boards, administrating their goods and planning their next steps. In that sense, I really like this game.

Cutthroat [b]________[COLOR=#FF0000][9][/COLOR]_[/b] Friendly: As a result of the almost exclusively indirect interaction between the players, there are very rare occasions where the players act viciously and aggressive towards each other. The most aggressive moment I ever witnessed was when someone took another player’s fish before the latter one had the chance to build a canoe. It’s all good friendly fun… Mostly.

Heavy use of language [b]__[COLOR=#FF0000][3][/COLOR]_______[/b] No language needed: Again, after reading the rulebook, good players will decide to follow the rules to the letter or to improvise around them. Either way, “Bison’s” game play it’s almost completely free of language. Instead, the presence of symbols  in the player’s boards are most helpful and easy to understand!

Played a couple of times (months apart) with 3 and 4 players. Bison is a mid-weight majority-control game that has an attractive theme and a couple of unusual aspects that make it different from other games of the type: namely the tile tesselation, and the fact that true scoring only occurs at the end of the game. Our games lasted a little too long, but the end result surprised me on both occasions. Probably gameplay would be quick enough if we were familiar with the game.

Tile-laying:Area control

WOW! One of my favourite designers newest and most disappointing games, in fact it is my least fav from him and I have tried and I own a lot of his games with several in my top 10. I feel kinda bad giving this rating but I got to call em as I see em. 

Very slow moving and prone to AP, dry, kinda boring really and I won the game, three of us were trying to quit to play something else but damn we finished the game. The game should be XXX rated as everything is SOOOOO Restricted re: getting guys on the board, upgrading, moving etc etc. I kept thinking we must be playing wrong but alas we checked the rules again and again to no avail. 

The scoring and the modular board layout were the strengths here but then that got totally ruined when we were told that all the scoring will be reset to zero RIGHT before the endgame scoring, so no matter how efficiently you played throughout it really didn't matter squat, it was all about setting up for the final scoring (like Tempus in this way). This didn't sit well with anyone whether or not the novel idea was there to give everyone a chance. 

WAY too much time investment for what it was, it could be tweaked here or there but there are so many already good games with these mechanics in their raw form that it would not be worth it. 4 players was quite bad, it might be better with 3 or maybe even 2 but I hope to never find out and I already own much better games in this genre for those numbers. By BGG's rating system I could rate this a 2 because I will not play it again. 

For a MUCH better game similiar in theme and play but with many more elements implemented much much better look at Kramer's "Wildlife".

I really love Kramer's and Kiesling's action point system games but this game befuddled me a bit. The gameplay is simple enough but there are sometimes a lot of options of what to do, not all of them always good options though. While I'm not usually subject to analysis paralysis, this game caused a lot of it and therefore took longer than excepted.  While making hard decisions is a good thing, in this game making those decisions didn't often gain a lot.

Another area control game that doesn't really do anything clever or new. Closest thing to 'interesting' about this is the shape of the tiles. 
Plays fine, but it's nothing to write home about. High cost of new assets seems to cause problems; it's easy to add onto someone elses prarie / mountains / river and build a bigger force to claim it, but seems very difficult to react to it with any kind of speed. Get shafted on all 3 resources at once and it's a very difficult hole to dig yourself out of.

Did ok until the last round, I was spending less + pulling in more food.  What I didn't see (hopefully I'll play again before I forget this), is that 3 & 4th place positions might have been more efficient use of people, compared to getting into the 1st place battle... there were some easy points to be had... but I couldn't get near them (too far away), so had lots of food, but few useful actions the last round... went from pulling in the most food all through the game to pulling in the least food at the end of the game.  Aargh.  ;-)  Great fun though!!! Very, very competition through the game with agonizing choices to be made.

I bought this because I love the theme, Native Americans competing for resources and Counting Coup on other tribes. The box art is unexciting as is the quality of the components. You place tiles similar to CARCASSONNE while the end scoring is heavily influenced by TIGRIS. The whole game centers around the resources of Fish, Wild Fowl and Bison which you use to pay for all your actions.

Entirely solid game, but does not contribute much to the genre.  As in many games, players are vying for leadership in areas.  Leadership is not majority based but more like Entdecker - a single "big" unit eclipses any number of lesser units.  Also, as in Entdecker, tiles are added during play and the areas competed over grow according the the ways players position the tiles.

The innovation here is that when players win mid-game contests for control, they don't get victory points, but rather more resources which are used to bring units onto the board or make them bigger.  Also, units may move (giving a little of the feel of Kreta), although are very limited in their movement.  Then a final scoring takes place - and it is done in exactly the same way as the mid game scorings, only now the stakes are VP's.

Art is UG-LY.

I can easily see this growing in interest with more play, but for now it is eclipsed by more obviously appealing games such as Entdecker and Kreta.

RATING: 6
The luck of the tile draw has too big an impact. Also, the person fourth in turn order in the first round is at a distinct disadvantage. They go last in the first round when going first is important to claim areas, and they go first in the last round when going last is important to maintain majorities. 

I do like how you have to manage three different resources, and how end scoring works, but overall the game is underwhelming.

This seems like a blend of Tikal and El Grande. The tile placement is not a mechanic in the same way as in Carcassonne, where placement is key. Here it is more important as a way to make the food point (victory point) areas fluctuate in value. The limited actions make each choice seem to really count, so it can get brainy with our group. The theme works and it is a pleasant-loking game on the table.

I enjoyed this more than I expected, but I still don't envision this getting played too often.  Luckily, the game didn't take as long as I anticipated, but I would still really only want to play this if it were a 45 minute game.  AP can be a huge problem in this game and it would definitely kill the enjoyment.  

I think there are a lot of options and intriguing decisions to make, but the whole game doesn't feel that much different from any other area majority game to make it stand out.  There seems to be a huge amount of luck dictated by the tile draw, though I guess more experienced players should be able to deal with it.  I like the differently shaped tiles (reminiscent of Mesopotamia in their oddity), but in practice they are a little annoying, easily becoming messed up with just a little nudge.

Rating is based upon an initial solo run-through in order to understand the rules.  There is a whole lotta game for such a small box!  Decisions are brutal and there is an ongoing struggle managing your resources.  For an area control game, this seems surprisingly good with just 2-players.   3 - 4 would be even better I am sure, but I fear that it would make the game a lot longer than people would want.

In the past I stated that El Caballero is what Carcasonne should have been, but I think Bison does it even better.  

Really disappointed in the visual presentation of this game.  The teepees and canoes blend into the background... would have benefited from something a bit nicer.

UPDATE:  This is a very good game! Played full 6 rounds in a 2-player.  The entire game was tense and focused. Still dislike the artwork.

Bison has the typical Kramer & Kiesling touch: a tile placing / area majority game with a constant feeling of not having enough actions and/or money (food) to do everything you want or should do. The (minor) variants certainly add to the game and it is recommended to include them, as these offer even more possibilities and options. The components are simply beautiful.

Nothing new, nothing special --> a very basic majority game. But what a  awkward victory point system there is! Components aren't best one either. So... because there are a lot of good/great majority games, there is no reason to play this...

RATING: 7
One play.  4 players.  Considering I pretty much hate their other action point type games, and the fact that I got owned in my single game, I really thought this was a good game.  We never had trouble figuring out who was where on a tile, nor was it that confusing how many animals were on a tile.  This is really quite a bit different from a standard action point game in that, you can really only do 3 different actions on your turn, plus a compulsory move, and they all cost the same in "action points", that is, one point per action.  Now, how many resources that action will cost is different depending on how strong an action you take (the more hunters involved in an action, the more resources it costs to perform).  My only problem was figuring out movement across tiles, but I don't think that'll be a problem in the second game.

Fairly standard area influence game. There is an economic angle to it with having to raise bison, wildfowl, and fish in order to purchase more braves, teepees, and canoes at the market.  The scoring is a little interesting and feels a little like Ingenious (and actually uses the same concept to break ties).

I like Bison quite a bit and would choose to play it over some of my other area influence games.  Good components. Wish it supported more players though.

Putting it up for trade. Just can't seem to get it to the table any more.

Nice small box! nice, tight & economic game, good with 2 and 3, and with 4 players if you don't mind a tiny bit of backstabbin chaos.

Seemingly a dull combination of been-there-done-that mechanics, this game is quite a fresh surprise once you get the hang of it. The modular board ensures that the area majority principle is modified as areas change as you play, making this game quite suitable for 2 players. In fact, I play it strictly 2p, as more players induce AP and unwanted chaos to the game. 2 Player games allow for all kinds of luring and decoy tactics which cost too many resources in a multiplayer game - but with just 2, this is quite a heavy-thinking 1-hour game full of twists and turns.
Update: a 3-player game was surprisingly fun and the AP / chaos elements were not as bad as I expected. Still avoiding 4p though.

There is a lot to like in this game, but the tile mechanism breaks the whole thing up for me. As laying a tile down is the only way to get new indians on the board, drawing a tile that matches your objectives (or that can be put on a good spot on the board) has a big impact on the game. Because of that I would have liked to have a tile queue, or maybe the option to pay some extra points/ressources to look at x tiles/draw y, or something like that.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
True it's another K&K majorities game but I found it really intriguing.  Players earn food determined by their majorities in three different region types on the board.  You get fish in the streams, turkeys in the mountainous areas and bison in the meadows.  The food is used to pay for action points (to feed the hunters) and to buy teepees and canoes (which add to the majority totals).  There's a tile-laying mechanic too which can be used to create new regions, expand regions or join regions.  The choices in the game are difficult for a few reasons: you have a limited number of hunters to work with (although those can be melted down to teepees/canoes and returned to your supply to be bought back later), actions are expensive... you won't always be able to pay for the number of hunters you want to move/activate and the scoring, although easy to understand, is difficult to parse out quickly.  This is one of the heavier area-control euros out there.

A somewhat convoluted and unconvincing rule set doesn't really do justice to what could be a much better, and more streamlined, game. The level of ingenuity and component quality is great for the price, but the Carcassonne-Hellas hybrid mechanics just don't sit happily enough, for reasons I can't quite identify. It might have something to do with the fact that they're like Carcassonne and Hellas of course. I seem to be in the minority in finding the artwork quite pleasant.

This is a neat little area control / action optimization game. What's cool about the design is that Kramer sets players up to fail, or succeed, or whatever--it's entirely up to them. It's possible to totally hose yourself by making poor purchases or getting out of position, and that's great; too many Euros let everyone do well. There is a bit of luck due to the tile draw, and that's awesome too.

The downside is it's a little long, and can suffer from AP.

Some interesting terrain effects, but it seems (after 1 play) that placement and movement are too costly to provide major shifts, so the game degenerates into 1 or 2 battles that king-make the game, and therefore too stagnant and AP/min-max prone for fun. It works nonetheless, just too slowly.

This is a tight in your face game where you are always wishing you had not one extra turn, but ten extra turns. You can never do everything you want or even half of it. You must really fight for every resources and try to be in first or second for many of them. However, do not get caught in a huge battle for one field since you will leave too much area free for your opponents and the two people fighting will fall behind. The score will always be close, in the games I have played; the winner had at most two more points then his opponent. The game is designed to keep everything near by and not let anyone simply run off and do their own thing. It is a great game, but be sure not to be put off by the first few turns since it does seem a little simple at first and may get frustrating. But by the end, I liked it a lot; as did almost all the people I played with. Kramer and Kiesling have not lost their touch!

I've become a big fan of Wolfgang Kramer and Michael Kiesling games and this is not one of their games I can recommend checking out. I was excited to play a game with such a strange theme. Buffalo. Awesome. And this game has a turkey track? Yeah, I was in. I saw some online reviews, and found out that it's more of a Native American resource collection / area majority game, which was less exciting, but still. A k&k game with a turkey track. Still in. Well, in the end the game is fine, but not very exciting. Once per turn you place a tile with a few cubes, and then you take two other actions that are either moving your cubes around very slowly between tile features, or converting them to structures that win for area majority. Then you collect whatever stuff you are sitting on, rinse, repeat. Then for endgame scoring you zero your resources and then collect one last time, and whoever collected the most stuff at the very end wins. It's mechanically competent but it's missing something for it to be in any way interesting or special. I'd say this guy might just be a victim of his age as it's a 2006 release, but el grande was 1995 so I really don't know what the excuse for this being so dry is.

An interesting game, with some tile laying, an economy and area majority. I like the simplicity and consistency of the rules, even if it takes a well to "get it". The balance between dynamism (fighting for and winning areas) vs defence seems about right. The tacics are interesting - timing and turn order is critical. The strategies are opaque to me, and I don't do well in the game, but it still intrigues me. Quite aggressive for a euro game. Recommended, especially with players who don't dawdle.

Area control, tile placement, and efficient use of resources. The animals collected during the game (bison, turkeys and salmon) via majority scoring are used in specific ratios to purchase canoes and teepees, as well as to move hunters. These, in turn, help players win the three area control rounds to gain more animals, which are totalled for end of game scoring.

Alguem teve uma ideia genial para um tabuleiro modelar e depois andou a dar voltas à procura de um tema e de umas coisas que encaixassem. Achou que com indios e bisontes, o jogo seria uma selvajaria e ninguem daria por isso, mas enganou-se! Há alguma substância em Bison, mas não é muita, joga-se mas demora muito tempo para o gozo que permite. O criador não teve o apoio que um jogo destes precisava por parte do editor. Não é um jogo mau, mas facilmente poderia ser melhor!

I wouldn't quite say this is a hidden gem, but it surely does not get the recognition it deserves.

A tile laying, area control game with a couple fresh twists. If you're familiar with the Kramar style of area control, you should know what to expect.

Each player gets 4 actions during a round, and the game last 4-6 rounds depending on the number of players. What does that mean? Well, it's satisfying area control in a filler length game. That's definitely something that fits a niche in my collection. There's a bit of randomness with tile draws, but it all seems to even out by the end while keeping things from becoming predictable.

I'm not a huge fan of the artwork (is it blurry photography?). Other than that, I can only praise it for its quick play time, clever mechanics and interestingly deep strategic play.

This is an interesting area control game.  Having to buy your tents and canoes (area control pieces) is the key that makes this one feel different for me.  Managing your limited actions, your dwindling food stores (money), and planning ahead in order to allow yourself room to play hunters (control markers) to the board can be a real challenge.  I also love the fact that you can withhold your tile placement until other players have taken threatening actions.  Overall this is a game I think I can enjoy in several repeat plays.

Another generic Euro area control game. Not Kramer's finest hour... excessively tactical to the point where planning is useless.

It's nice and portable, in the event that you feel a burning desire to experience mediocrity on the go.

Multiplayer pick on the other player. The player who gets picked on the least will usually win. Sure you can work on putting yourself in a position that makes it harder for the others to work you over, but it's all a bit unsatisfying in the end. It's not terrible by any means, but as area majority games go it doesn't grab me as anything special or fun.

I like this game a lot more than I thought I would.  Mechanically, the game evokes the feel of carcassone.  However, the area control aspect is more pronounced, and the spending of food (which is also points) to do anything leads to tough decisions.

This is a farily interesting cross between Carcassonne, Tikal or Java, and Kreta. For the time being I like it allright. It's good, but not particularly fun. I don't see playing it very often, before long it'll probably hit the shelf :/ In the meantime I will enjoy playing it for as long as it holds out!

It didn't hold out long. I just traded this away. It's far too mathy to relly be fun. I do like it better than Torres and Java though.

Ooof. This is a tough game.

I really think that I like the way this works, but it is just downright hard.  The decision making process is very limited and every choice you make is very important.  There is a lot of information to take in and you really need to make an informed decision.  This equates to a requirement of excessive brain power.  It is so easy to get your goods taken from you and so hard to take them back that it is essential to weigh not only all your options but the options of others (those they've can take now and those later in in the season).  

It is difficult to really make your decision on your turn as your options can easily become vastly different with each action that other players make.  The scoring is very kooky, so often you are spending your time mathing out the reprocussions.  All in all, this is a serious brain burner.

That's not to say that I don't like it, in theory. The result though is a game that just requires too much and ends up being A/P heavy and overly long.  To make it worse is that it justifies the effort, so you can't ask others to play quicker.  The only solution is to play with less players.  (I've only played this with four).  I suspect my rating will go up with three players.  If anyone thinks that any of the other mask games force players into catatonia, welcome to Bison.

If I have a real gripe about the game, I think that the tile draw is unconscionably lucky compared to the weight and gameplay of the rest of the game.  Drawing a three turkey is just flat out better than drawing a diversified tile.  If you were allowed to place your pieces on any or all of the terrains when you laid the tile down it would at least even the odds and create a choice (although still a weaker option).

Even though it is absurd, I think that the size of the box is actually the biggest downfall of the game.  If this game came in a bigger box people would be more forgiving of the weight and length.  That, and if the tiles used real art instead of the awful computer graphics.

At the end of it all though, while it is technically a "good" game, I don't find it either fun or compelling.

Tepee or not tepee, that is the question. Canoe see the blatant fowl?

RATING: 7
There are, I think, some hidden subtleties to this game, which require a playing or two (or three or four) to fully appreciate. For example, while placing a tile (and hunters) is often chosen as the first of the four actions one can perform, it is not necessary to do this first. There are sometimes good reasons to hold off placing the tile as your first action. Then, too, there is the issue of how many hunters to commit to the board. And what exactly constitutes a 'safe' area? (i.e., one that requires the committment of only a single teepee. Try not to say "teepee' too many times. It gets to sounding seriously silly.) Overall, an enjoyable 'middle weight' game experience

RATING: 7
Played three times.

Decent area majority game with a modular board.  Players vie for majorities in areas that contain game (fish in rivers, birds in mountains, bison in plains).  Movement of your pieces (Indians) requires payment of food.  There are four actions on each turn out of a possible six that mostly involve movement of Indians. After everyone has taken their fourth action, animals are harvested from the regions controlled by each player.  

You only have 8 Indians to place, but you can get them back off the board by building teepees or canoes (two of the six actions) as permanent placeholders.  The teepee/canoe/Indian economy is the most unique part of this game, and keeps it, in my mind, from being lumped in with all the other AC games out there.  A scoring twist makes it possible to score well even if you hold third place or worse in a region, which adds some depth of strategy.   

It's quite gamey and the theme is thin, which is the case with most pure AC games.  There may be an issue with turn order in the 4p game, but it may also be that it just limits the decisions that player 1 and player 4 make in the first and last rounds.  A scoring twist makes it possible to score well even if you hold third place or worse in a region, which adds some depth of strategy.  All in all, I'd rather play El Grande.

RATING: 5
Bison feels like an advanced Carcassonne, aimed at gamers rather than families. I grew up on the prairies, so I appreciate and enjoy the theme; others may not. At its core, it's an area majority optimization game, which means it can be tense, and there are many opportunities for cutthroat play, but there's also potential for AP as players decide how best to use their limited actions. Better than the average euro, for sure. My rating might be low, but the production values could be a lot better, which, unfortunately, affects how much I want to play it. With Mexica offering a similar but superior experience, Bison is left out.

1 play. Area control game. Seemed very limited with the basic rules and 4 players - couldn't do much with your actions. Also, turn order seemed to be overly important. Would like to try it with the variant rules, although I'm not sure we'll be able to get it back to the table with our group.

Plays fairly quickly, but its reasonably brain-burny.  Lots of limited choice mechanics; limited actions, limited resources.
I would like to rate this a '7' - however, after a few plays, it seems there may be a serious turn order problem.  The player in the 4th position seems to be pretty much doomed from the start, while the player in 2nd position seems to have a huge advantage.  (Going early is good in the first two turns, while going late is a huge advantage is the second two turns.  The poor 4th position player is stuck going last first turn and having all the good spots already taken, then has to go first on the critical scoring round and can't protect resources).

Fun stuff in a small box and love the art!

UPDATE: Been playing it more and well, I'm liking it more and more. Underrated game for CERTAIN.

This game was surprisingly good at 2 players. I didn't expect it to play well at all and even said so before we started off but man did it prove me wrong.

Bison is a Kramer-Kiesling game.  Right there, I already half like it, as I just enjoy almost every game they make.  This is another riff on area control with a limited set of actions, like several of their other games.  In this one, you're trying to get control of as much food (fish, bison and turkeys) as you can, but you need to spend those resources to further stake your claims.

I really enjoyed this one.  It doesn't necessarily do that much different than several of their other games, but it does it well and it was fun.

In Bison every player is representing a native American Indian tribe. Aim is to settle in an area rich of bison, fish and turkeys. The tribe need bison as food and clothes (leather), they need fish for food and the turkeys and their feathers for rituals and adornment. The players catch bison, fish and turkeys and keep the score as markers on their own overview board. The animal markers are used to survive, to explore new land and to buy canoes and tents at the market. The player who has the most animals wins the game.

OK majority game with some original elements (like using your indians both as population and building blocks and the ability to score even if you do not have a majority).

Bison is definitely a relative of Tikal/Java/Mexica, and I find it the least enjoyable of the series (though I haven't played Mexica). The brain-burning is serious, and makes the game last far longer than it should be. The majorities are determined in a kooky way, which makes the AP all the worse. Tile draw and player order have a huge influence also. I'm sure this gets better and quicker with repeated plays, but I have no desire to invest the time in it, not only because the art is terrible, and the theme weak in comparison to the three Mask games.

In my only game of this so far there wasn't really an AP issue, which seems to be a prevalent complaint about the game (our game was with 3 though- maybe more players would be a problem). What did bother me was the scoring mechanic wherein the third place player in an area sometimes stands to gain more points than the player in second (unless the rules were explained wrong). It would have been a lot cleaner and less gamey if a simple "full points for 1st place, half points for 2nd place, no one else gets anything" mechanic were used. Instead there are byzantine rules for 3rd place and beyond that undermine much of the tension in my view. Granted, I've only played once, and otherwise I actually found the game quite enjoyable albeit not earth-shattering in any way. Definitely need to play this again, or at least make sure the rules were explained right.

Vesión de Borrás del clásico del 86' de Waddingtons. Fantástica la ruleta!, aunque los componentes de la nueva versión son mejores, el plastiquete y la ruleta le dan una pinta retro-nostalgia 80' que oye, mola un monton :)

Survive es la nueva edicion y The island, la misma nueva edición en castellano pero son iguales. Y también han sacado una nueva versión de Survive! en el espacio xD

Used to play this quite a lot as a kid. Beautiful components even with today's standards.

2015-10-27
4->6
Found this at my parents' attic and to my surprise realised that all playing pieces were there. I was quite sceptic about the quality of the game because this was from '86 after all, and as a rule of thumb, the best games from my childhood have been disappointments when played again in 21st century. However, when I started to read the rules, I thought 'hey, we might have a game in here', and Atlantis proved to be a thumb breaker.

Most of the decisions a player has to make are tactical in nature, and are played at the very moment. Especially with four players there is less room for devising longer sequences of moves, since the board evolves so much every turn. The decisions are meaningful, though, offering nice trade-offs to think about. 

Admittedly, the game is not spectacular by today's standards but you cannot call it a bad game either. Actually, I quite enjoyed it and so did everyone else in the table. I also liked the dramatic arc of the game. The story inevitably pushes the game towards the end and the final showdown.

If there is something to whine about, it is the rules. Atlantis suffers from the same syndrome with many other games from its era. Despite being well written, the rules do not cover many of the special situations you encounter during the game. This leads to too many house rules, which isn't good.

Anyways, a good game and extremely beautiful components.

RATING: 7.5
I like this, but it's not as good as I hoped it would be. Whether Survive is any better, I don't know.

The pieces are great and it's one of those great British games from the 70s and 80s that are clearly antecedents of some of the Euros we have now - others being Mediterranean, Mine a Million and Escape from Colditz.

It starts off great, but there is not quite enough sea-creature movement and the endgame tends to be too long.  However, I think this could be easily cured with house rules:  end the game so many turns after the last piece of the island disappears, for instance.  We also have the version with the spinner - which I like, BUT it's not very bloody.  The dolphins move far too often.  I guess I could maybe open and amend it or else make some dice and use them...or perhaps get some cards.

There are strong similarities to the idea behind Pompeji, though I have to say that the newer game is much better for adults, though maybe this one is better for young family play.

RATING: 5
Good family game, even if eliminating pieces could potentially cause bad feelings. I've put together a hybrid of the two Waddington editions. Basically I had a full later edition, but picked up an incomplete copy of the earlier version for the spinner (the dice are too dolphin-friendly). I found I also preferred the wooden pegs to the plastic people, and the smaller sea creatures are easier to fit on to the hexes.

nicht wirklich häufig gespielt, Anleitung verloren aber als pdf wieder gefunden. Die Plastikinselelemente sind nicht wirklich schön (oder kommt es mir heute nur so vor?). 
Dies Spiel könnte man sicherlich als das Gegenteil eines Koop-Spieles nennen. Habe es 2013 dann noch einmal in der 30 Jahre danach Neuauflage The Island angeschafft. Diese Version mit Inselelementen aus dicker Pappe sieht schon ganz gut aus (jedenfalls viel besser als die Plastikteile).

UK version of the classic "escape from the sinking island" board game. This version is very three dimensional (plastic sculpts in place of island hex tiles) with very nice bits - the Meeps and sea creatures are much better than the North American versions. The rules are quite similar but not identical. Matter of taste as to your preference. This was one of those "value village" treasures one occasionally stumbles across and I'm thrilled to have in my collection. For more information, see Survive: Escape from Atlantis.

Childhood memories:
"WHOW this game looks reeeeeeally kewl. Muuuuuum! Daaaaad!"

Late 20s:
"Wait there was a game I always wanted but never got...something with Atlantis and taking away tiles."
Bought it used for 2 EUR and I really love it...for what it is. A childhood memory.
It came out in the 80s and you really feel that. But nevertheless it is a short fun game that you should never play with angry people.
It's a good game as a filler with nostalgic bonus and a lot of "Take that, sucker!".

When I was young, I had the related game Survive! and in a recent fit of nostalgia bought this version online.  While I love it, I think the added features of the original make it a much better game.  Pretty plastic pieces don't make up for interesting variants and a board that can't really fit the game on it.  Still, for classic game fun, you won't find much better than this.

(Not sure why this has a separate entry from Survive!--just a couple rule tweaks and different bits)Wow. There are some significant differences between rulesets of the different editions. I find the rules with dolphins (that only protect, not instantly transport to safety) to be the best.Although I haven't played with hidden values of Atlanteons, I can see how that would be better, and will probably mark up my pieces at some point. This is one of those fun simple games from yesteryear that stand the test of time.

The plastic bits in this game are phenomenal. But it
didn`t have the varied scoring points on the villagers.
When I bought the new reprint "Survive:Escape from Atlantis" I saw what the older version was missing.
That little difference made alot of added tension. Where
did I put that high scorer again? In all the chaos and 
shit that`s happening around the island you sometimes lose track. Must be Alzheimer setting in. Anyways perfect
game for young and old to play around with. Highly recommended. Just remember to keep swimming when jaws
is on your tail.

A classic? Perhaps indeed... A testament for that honour is that it still can draw in kids today. That is, my two (videogame loving ) sons! They were quickly immersed into the game's atmospheric  theme and didn't mind the take-that nature of the ruleset.

We own the 1996 Parker version in Dutch.
----
About rules: 1.) came into play before the second game.  2.) while playing that second game and 3.) at game end. For our third game we may implement other ideas.

Personal houserules/interpretations:
1.) One of each monster and a dolphin are placed on the board at setup. (At the board's edge, on the four spaces centered between the islands. SeaMonster and Octopus on opposite sides, Shark and Dolphin on the other opposites.)

2.) Swimmer protected by a Dolphin may move 3 spaces. It can switch protection benefiting the player on turn, either for swimming or protecting.

3.) Moving to (+climbing onto) a boat or moving to a Dolphin is considered as having used up the 1MP for that swimmer. (Except when a.) climbing onto a boat while moving with a Dolphin, b.) you have MP left for another Atlantean on the same boat.)

Great, no... FABULOUS bits. Unfortunately they're also impossible to fit into the hexes.
Basically Survive. Action-point system of running away and directing baddies at your opponents.
Fun, if a bit random, particularly when flipping the land tile (anything from a whirlpool to a ship!).

RATING: 5
The components are a big problem in my 1996 Waddington edition. The sea creatures are too large for the hexes, and the citizens too easily fall off the tiles. None of this would matter so much if the game play were wonderful, but there's quite a bit of "take that."

Underrated game! Great fun and for all its seemingly randomness it is well-balanced in the end. A slow-the-leader factor is present but not overwhelming. Hidden scoring via secret pawn values is genius. shared boat movement provides benefits to partnership, and can also lead to backstabbing too! Great fun in a simple package, highly recommended for fun factor.

This is a family/kids oriented game but whenever is setup I wouldn’t say no to one more challenge. The theme is well known – the island of Atlantis is about to end in Davy Jones’ locker! Every player gets a number of Atlanteans with a matching color. The island consists of several land tiles. Each land tile supports 0 to 3 inhabitants and every turn a land tile disappears under sea. The object for each player is to save as many of his inhabitants as he can by swimming or ferrying them to a near by stable land. The player with most persons ashore wins the game. Easier said than done. Sharks, whirlpools and giant octopuses which are moved by your adversaries in turn are luring in the area for prey. There is no real planning, a chaos unfolds and fates of your inhabitants are left to Lady Luck.

RATING: 7
Oh-the sheer destruction of an eddy! A very fun game to play - haven't tried the integrated rules of Survival-wuzzitcalled but this edition already had whales and giant octopuses and whatnot in it. 
I suspect that the only difference between the two editions are the numbers and value of the different stowaways which could be easily implemented... if one really wished to, that is.
It just looks a little unfair to me, I mean: it doesn't exactly reward a fellow's cunning and misanthropy! Why, it may even completely turn the tables on a dastardly plot begotten by a sleazy, merciless and cunning criminal mind! What an injustice!
Just what traits are we trying to cultivate in our children anyway?
A big plus in favour of this game is the feeling of omnipotence you derive when you remove tiles and physically sink the land - a bit like the old game Populous, in a way!
Edit: I investigated further - the other game does bring a different if not additional level of machination to the game - I'll have to try it!

This old game is just plain fun to play with correct group. The "patend pending" roller that you roll at end of your turn to move monsters creates great moments.

Played as a family game is great. I own the wadd version. After reading the suggestions of the designer of the game (thank you very much, honoured, see article) we are enjoying the game a lot.

I've always wanted to try out Escape from Atlantis as I group up with the earlier 'Survive!' when I was a child. I was surprised to not like this version as much as I was hoping I would. The pieces are great! Nice, chunky 3D stuff that would have blown my mind back in 1986. And pretty much the same game as Survive, but all the significant changes I thought were a step back. The people no longer have values (each is simply worth 1) which kills some of the tension. The game doesn't start with any sea monsters. The dice are set to get dolphins and 'Dive' most of the time and because you don't put people in the water when you remove a land piece, it is very rare to have swimmers unless luck favours the octopi. Because everyone is the same value, you can determine before the game ends who will no longer be able to win (which makes their continued play redundant). There are no tokens which prevent attacks from following through. Overall, these changes seem to make things nicer and easier for younger players, but kills that sort of adult-friendly nature of the game. Too bad! The hunt still continues for a Parker Bros. 1982 edition.

Recently obtained in trade, my copy is a somewhat recent German edition from Schmidt Spiele entitled "Atlantis."  Huge box (the large board has but one fold) and truly excellent plastic bits.  The "Atlanteans" are plastic figures of a type that were not in the image-base of BGG so I addressed that.  This edition uses a spinner to move the creatures rather than dice.  Atlantis looks like a fun game to play with kids or as a "beer and pretzels" game with adults.

I gave this game to a member of my game group who has several young children who will actually play the game.

Escape from Atlantis is essentially Survive!  I do like the different values of people in Survive! so I may incorporate that into Escape from Atlantis.  The biggest difference between the two games is the overall component quality.  Escape from Atlantis looks great, especially the land pieces and boats.  This game has aged well, and it is pure backstabbing bliss.  I have the '96 edition.

RATING: 6.5
Survive is a much better game.  I can't stand to play this without rule adjustments.
So far my recommendations are:

i) Whirlpool doesn't destroy land
ii) Modify die so that there is one less dolphin and one additional octopus
iii) Give the people values like Survive
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A fun game that looks gorgeous. I prefer the more modern version (Survive) since the rules are slightly better tweaked there and since the plastic figures here have a strong tendency to keep falling off the island, but it's still a great game.

RATING: 7
A fast, light, funny, cut-throat game, with a bit of tactics and a lot of chaos, not to be taken seriously. First I bought the 1996 Waddingtons edition, with the best-looking pieces. But the dice completely spoil the original distribution of creatures movement: dolphins come up too often, all creatures move too little. Then I just had to buy the 1986 edition with the cool spinning device. I took the spinner along with the box and rules, kept everything else from the other edition, and sold the other hybrid to a friend.

A great light family game. I prefer Pompeii, which scratches the same itch and has way more strategy than luck, but that doesn't stop this being tremendous fun. I found this for £1 in a charity shop; the box has selotape/price sticker damage, but everything inside was mint.

[q='rickkeuler'][b]The Ultimate Whirlpool[/b]

The game end phase begins when the last piece of the island is sunk. Then, after the player completes all three phases of their turn (i.e. Move, Sink and Monsters), the Ultimate Whirlpool begins, destroying every single piece in the center hex on the board.

The next player takes his turn (now only Movement and Monsters) and then the Ultimate Whirlpool expands one complete ring on the board (six hexes), destroying every single piece (monsters, dolphins and boats included). 

This continues until the whirlpool has cleared the board, or all the Atlanteans are dead or safe, at which point the game would end.[/q]

This is the 100th game I bought. I got the 1986 Waddingtons version off of eBay.

This game is a blast. I enjoyed playing it though I did change the rules a bit to make the game a little bit more ruthless with a lot of eatting or ship destroying going on.

The game also is a lot more interesting when points are placed on the bottom of your guys to determine the winner rather than simply the amount of people you save.

Allyson and Larkin bought their own copy of the game after playing it with me a few times. We love the carnage!

RATING: 4
My memories of this game were better than the reality. Looking beyond the nostalgia, there’s not much more than a random exercise in player bashing. The movement steps for the own pawns are decided by a simple speculation on the highest survival probability. The destructive steps of sinking an island tile and moving a sea monster are free-for-all take-that gameplay. In the German version, the dolphins add a strange element of a perfect shelter that doesn’t fit with the rest of the game. A few other rules in this edition are suboptimal as well, e.g. distributing the survivors from a sinking tile on other island tiles.

Other editions probably have more coherent rulesets but the basic form of gameplay will remain. Not a type of game I’m interested in playing anymore. From this time, there are other games like Auf Achse, Dampfross or Café International I still enjoy notwithstanding their high luck factor.

Very unique race-off-the-island game. Its a very quick game that seems a bit unbalanced and random (whirlpool?), but is still fun to play. The components for the newer version are fantastic although a bit fiddly, and the map seems a tad too small.

I had the 80's version called Survive! with cardboard tiles when I was a kid. We loved the game, and would take every opportunity to eat our opponent's little guys. Now I have the Waddington's version with all the fun 3D plastic bits, and the game is still just as enjoyable. 

My only word of warning is to be gentle with younger kids, as they sometimes get upset when you sink their guys. Overall it's definitely a classic that can stand the test of time.

Waddingtons did well with this game, it has everything that a good family game should have. Lots of action, swimmers to rescue, a sinking island, eating your opponents swimmers with monsters and sharks and plays in about 30 minutes. This is a good introductory game for non-gamers. One warning though - get the version with the swirler.

Ein Kinderspiel, aber mit viel fun und Schadensfreude ;)
In der Brettmitte ist die Insel Atlantis aufgebaut, auf ihr unsere Pöppel, die es gilt übers Meer ans rettende Ufer zu bringen. Dabei fällt Atlantis imemr weiter auseinander, bis nichts mehr übrig ist. Haie, Seeungehäuer und Kraken machen es schwer, seine Gefolgsschaft zu retten. Schiffe und Delfine helfen einem, aber die Mitspieler funken meisst dazwischen und schmeissen einem Seeungehäuer zwischen die Beine.
Ganz spassiges Spiel, das ich bei einem Bekannten als Kind gespielt hatte. War jetzt recht happy, das ich es nochmal spielen konnte ;)

[b]Interesting game with quite a bit of atmosphere if you play it with the right people. Can overstay its welcome, though, if players play cat and mouse by alternating the same moves over and over again. There is a lot of "Take that!" going on, which can lead to "Why did you kill my swimmer and not his" whining, so I wouldn't play this with everyone.[/b]

I liked this as a kid when I played it at a friends place. When recently the game was hyped again due to the new publishing of Survive, Escape from Atlantis, I deceided to buy a second hand copy. However when I played it again, it was not as funny as I remembered and therefore I think it is better to trade it. 
Update: traded it together with Tempus for Steel Driver.

3 / 5 - Good.

This is a good, fun family game with rather more tactical action that it might appear since you can use boats, creatures and your own people on the island to block other players moves.

A fun but chaotic game of escaping from sinking Atlantis. With four players you're always not trying to effectively escape to safety as you're dodging seamonsters and sharks. Your people have better chances with just (two or) three players but it's a really fun experience with four players seeing hopeless attempts of escape. Plenty of chances for some very mean moves.

I have played with a variant where escapees have a (hidden) value instead of being all equal.

RATING: 7
I own the '87 (approx) edition from Schmidt Spiele.  In this version, survivors count one for one, there's a spinner (not dice), and some rules are a bit vague.  Still, I was playing this extremely quickly with my girlfriend and we both enjoyed it.  Took only about 30 mins per game, and it was all very simple.  Not too much screwage, and for 2 players it is a bit anti-climatic because most pawns are able to escape safely before the island disappears.  Would be much better with 3 or 4 players. 

Update: Good fun.  Simple and fast.  A smidge on the kiddy side, but it's OK.

As a kid, I found the prospect of the gameboard being a sinking island amazing and I reckon I still would. Although I tweaked the rules heavily to turn it into a sort of Survival/Disaster game, the base game is quite good as well and a nice way for kids to be introduced in fantasy boardgaming. 

EDIT: I played this again and found it really fun. Nice components and screwage without being too serious.

EDIT2: Played it once more and found it a bit longish and too random

I had this as a kid.  Loved it then.  There always were a couple of holes in the rules that drove me crazy, though.  (In the Canadian Waddington-Sanders "Escape from Altantis" version, at least.  On a side point, when I was 10 I used the pieces for this to design my own game, based on Peter Pan.  One side was Pan and the Lost Boys, the other was Captain Hook and his pirates.  The rules that I wrote up are still in the box at my family's house...  I read them recently and was impressed by one of the mechanics I designed!

RATING: 8
Sometimes known as 'Survive: Escape from Atlantis', this seems like it would be a frothy game aimed at parents of young kids, with not much going on. Wrong. While I'm sure it would work perfectly well in that situation, it also offers enough sneaky betrayal and cunning movement to satisfy people who would otherwise write it off. It's no Twilight Imperium, of course, but it's a nicely fun game for all.

The older Waddingtons edition from 1996 can not compete with the new Stronghold Games edition but still has the feel of a frantic game of survival. The light-heartidness creates the fast pace and therefore Escape from Atlantis is a fun game of laughs and backstabbing.

A hit with my gaming group, think we like the "screwage-factor" more than saving our people. Wish the game board was larger with more tiles to allow more turns per player. Also, most everyone forgets the value of the pawns after placing them (kinda important) but it's a solid game for sure.

While the pieces are much better here, I fear that the gameplay suffers in comparison to Survive.  That said it is still great.  I've fashioned my copy to more resemble the play of Survive (putting #'s on the pieces) and I put a volcano in one of the Grey land molds.  So now best of both worlds, the vote is still out on the spinner, I've adjusted the numbers to make it a little more nasty with less dolphin action.

Overall this is a fun game if you don't set your expectations too high going into it.  The bits in this game are fantastic and if you play with the right group it can be a lot of fun.  The only complaint I have is, due to the random dice factor, there aren't enough chances to move the monsters you really want to move to devour your opponents' swimmers.  I wish there was a better way to balance luck and the ability to choose to move a certain monster when you are presented with a golden opportunity.  Oh well, still a fun game when you are in the right mood.

Basically, Survive!, but with 3D plastic island pieces. The game is ok, but the whirlpool pieces wipe out so much of the island that it takes a lot of fun away for me. For this type of game, I prefer Pompeji (burning others with lava is fun).

Reimplemented as Survive! in America this is the British Waddingtons version of the game.
 One of my wife's and my favorites.    This is a great game for 2-4 players and creates a lot of tension you try to save your Meeples while everyone else is trying to save theirs and kill off yours.

I didn't remember much of this game, but I loved it as a kid... and then, 15 years later, when I couldn't find it anywhere (it still has to be somewhere, lurking in some shadowy corner of the attic or something), I bought it again... childhood memories sure can be deceiving, and I only play the game with my niece nowadays. It's decent but nothing too enjoyable (I still adore those little sea dragons, I think I'll paint them someday ^_^)

This is a game with what I'd like to call the best out-of-game interaction I have yet seen. The group was just perfect for a very, VERY silly session of drowning Atlanteans. This is and will be (I need to get this) a great relieve as opposed to some of the brain-burning games in my collection. Because that is what this game is definetely not. Nor should it be played with over-analyzing minds. This is really great for the kids and of course for the light-hearted. I believe this game should not be played too seriously. That would be against its nature.

Still fun, but a 9 is too much: 7.0

I've always liked to play this but nowadays there are way better games :) 
You try to rescue your people. Dice rolling determines which "monster" you can use to chase other players' people, e.g. if you roll a 3 and the symbol of the kraken, you can move the kraken three spaces towards your opponents' people and "devour" them. The player with the most saved people at the end of the end is the winner.

[b]A BIT OF A LAUGH IN TRUE B-MOVIE FASHION.[/b]

This game evokes the movie Warlords of Atlantis very well, though I'm not sure if that's the aim! A well thought out redux could take the Geek by storm, mark my words.

The box is stuffed to the gills with great bits of plastic: the modular city of Atlantis; hordes of plastic sea monsters; galleons; and four atlanteon tribes.

The game is surprisingly cutthroat, with plenty of gleeful opportunity for screwage. There's little as satisfying as sending in a purple sea serpent to sink a fellow player's ship, crowded with survivors, sending them all screaming to the depths.

At heart, this is a family game, but a Geek player can find many hours worth of fun moving sharks, etc, in for their feed... ...on another player's meeples!

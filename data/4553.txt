Just...awful.  A cross between Apples to Apples and Slapjack, with the worst of both.  I might prefer playing Give Yourself a Root Canal than this.  I think I made it 4 hands, then I had to quit before insanity took over.

Pretty fun, and while the sheep system cuts down on the humor in Apples to Apples (depending on the hipness of the judge), I enjoy the improved gameplay and the discussions that arise over whether a given attribute really fits or doesn't fit.

It's pretty similar to Apples to Apples but perhaps more silly and less thought-provoking.  After a few bottles of beer it's fun, especially if someone comes out with an odd or saucy word to match.The element of slapping you hand down on a card first makes for hilarity and sore wrists.

Good with the right crowd and possibly a few drinks.  The scoring system essential, arbitrary, and stupid.  Much better than the rules in the Z-man are the symmetric version, where you can either gain or lose points on both red and green cards.

RATING: 6
Adds a little more complexity to the ultra-simple Apples to Apples.  Players make up the categories themselves and some players try to not match.

It's still a party game though, and a little boring, but it's a decent choice is that's what you need.

RATING: 7
Fast-and-funny word association game. Maybe not the best idea to play twice in a row, though. Still a bit miffed that, when the topic was "fish" and I slapped "nutritive", I lost a point -- but ah, hell, it gives me something to give Ray guff about for a long time.

As played on BSW, this is a gem of a party game. It's very reminiscent of Apples to Apples with a certain distinctive element of strategy. I would recommend playing with at least 4 people. It is also important to make sure you play with individuals who have the same level of language/communication skills, otherwise the game breaks down. This is a small problem on BSW with the number of 2nd-language-English-speaking people online but it shouldn't be a problem in real life.

We needed an end of evening filler and this was thrown at us. We puzzled over the rules trying to fathom the game and the tactics where the bluffing comes in.

Doh! There is no game there is no bluffing. You have to choose a card with a word that either matches or doesn't the word chosen out of thin air by the active player. A card with a red or green sheep determines whether it should or shouldn't have a link, but unless you have picked the word, the chances are it won't. So you have to guess if the the concealled sheep is green or red and whether or not you should grab someones card combo.

Or just flip a coin. There is no skill, there is no game. It's a long time since I've encountered such a steaming pile of nonsensical crap. It doesn't even warrant a 1 rating.

Utterly dreadful.

Just to rub it in I 'won' the German language version of this on the lookout stand at Essen 2010. Just when I thought it couldn't get worse.

Given away. Thanks Derek!

Not a bad variation on the whole idea of Apples to Apples, but it feels perhaps a little too structured for my taste.  Some of the scoring can be extremely confusing for people, and the subjects can occasionally be a struggle to come up with.  Still there are moments where interesting or funny conversations will sprout up, which is probably the focus of the game.  Z-Man version has the most ridiculously oversized box.

A very interesting take on the Apples to Apples style of word association game - great for classrooms and parties alike.

I like the system of + and - cards, where you are trying to get rid of some cards and keep others.  Some players will be put off by having to come up with topics on their own, but realy this is straight forward (look around the room if you struggling!)

All in all a solid game, although more of a gamers word game.

This game is very much in the Apples to Apples vein of games, except perhaps a little more gamery, and featuring more convoluted scoring.

If you liked Apples to Apples but wished there was a little more to it, you might try this one.  If you hate that style of game, pass on this.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
In terms of laughs, this one is TOUGH to beat. Better than Apples to Apples in every way (though more complex.) 

The added depth just makes this game so much more interesting, funny and above all FUN. Due to the black/white sheep dynamic and the fact that players pick their own topics, you can't really get screwed by a bad hand and gives this game crazy amounts of longevity. 

On the minus side: The scoring system, in my experience, frustrates non-gamers and can even confuse seasoned gamers at first. Besides having a lot of little scoring rules to remember, you can get into a situation where you keep drawing white sheep cards it is impossible to get as many points as people who draw black sheep cards regularly.

The dexterity aspect also may turn off some players - especially when you get into a situation where everyone has a green sheep and the odd man out is blocked out of points that round.

But really, this is a party game. If you're focusing on the scores this game is not for you. Set those thoughts aside and you'll have a blast!

Fun game. Very similar to Apples to Apples, with less of a party game feel. More of a gamer's party game, which is nice, but I can't think of many situations where I would have the opportunity to play. Apples to Apples has a much more leisurely pace, people taking a few minutes to explain why each card is or isn't a contender for best choice, debating choices, etc. This is much more bang, bang, fast-paced moving along. Making your own categories is a nice change though, and results in much more replay value than Apples to Apples.

One play - which I enjoyed very much.  Like most part games a lot of the enjoyment depends on the people you play with.  And it doesn't have much in the way of balance.  But it IS silly and social and makes you rationalize out twisted logic ... which is something I enjoy in a social game.

Very similiar to Apples To Apples, but better in that everyone gets to try to pick the good connections every turn, rather than just the active player. The kicker is that some players are forced to play matching words, while others are forced to play mismatching words. You only want to grab wrods where players *meant* them to match. Many people can get points each round, which packs a lot more scoring potential in the game, rather than having to wait your turn. But in the end, it's still a light word game, which means it won't be a staple for me. And you have to make up your own categories, which can be a bit of a challenge when you're tired late at night.

You don't play this game to win.  You play it to have fun to find out how other people associate words and concepts.  It's particularly interesting choosing people you know as the topic to match to...

Where Apples to Apples's freeform judging provokes a  silly/whimsical/psychological game, Attribute's scoring system rewards only and exactly those that can correctly match concepts in a positive/negative correlation.  That probably makes it superior for some purposes (word exercises in an English classroom?  "serious" gaming?) but inferior for the kind of light and frothy get to know people or laugh with your friends kind of fun A2A is known for.

Much better [i]game[/i] than Apples to Apples - though with less hilarity. 

Make sure to use the original scoring rules discussed in comments of [url=https://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/179055/wacky-scoring-rules]this thread[/url] - the simplification of the US version makes scoring both less fair and less intuitive.

Components: Functional cards, though the font is a bit hard to read from a distance in a hurry.

Experience: It all happens so fast, with such chaos, there's no time to revel or really discuss the word choices, and the scoring can be very confusing as players after-the-fact try to figure out whose card they grabbed, and whether there is a plus or minus associated with it.

Take Apples to Apples, remove noun cards and add some complex like-unlike negative-positive scoring and a speed-grabbing competition instead of spirited discussion about what cards match best. Its clearly a party game, but the rush to grab cards kills any party-like discussion and the point scoring is a little fiddly to those that have had a few too many drinks.:) All-up its a bit of a mismatch to me.

RATING: 5
Nice alternative when you inevitably tire of Apples to Apples. In AtoA, players try to play nouns that match an attribute that is written on a card. In Attribute, players try to play attributes that either match or contradict a noun chosen by a player. The scoring in Attribute takes some getting used to, however.

Strange game.  Players hold 4 "attribute" cards and either a red or green sheep.  Somebody announces a topic and everybody plays their sheep/attribute face down.  The attributes are revealed and hands fly everywhere grabbing pairs.  If you take a green sheep you gain a point, red sheep you lose a point.  Reverse this if your sheep/attribute stays in front of you.  Quite similar to Apples to Apples in style, but simply not as much fun.

People will have a set of four attribute cards which is typically (always?) an adjective.  Each player will then be given a sheep card which is kept secret.  The sheep card will have a negative or positive.  The active player will choose a topic and then each person will secretively choose one attribute card to go with their sheep card.  If you have a positive sheep you want to add an attribute that matches the topic.  If you have a negative sheep you want to add an attribute that does not relate to the topic.  Once everyone has selected their attribute cards they are revealed simultaneously and players at a first-come-first-serve basis can choose to pick any players attribute card other than their own.  You don't have to choose a card if you don't want to but if you don't you will miss out on a scoring opportunity (whether it's positively or negatively depends on your intuition).  If people didn't choose your attribute card you can score positively or negatively.

I'm not going to describe rules any further as there are game reviews for this sort of thing.  I'll just say it's here are the cools parts of the game: (1) This game can be really funny based on the completely open-ended topics.  One example of an interesting topic is when someone chooses the name of a person playing the game as a topic. (2) It may be a party game but it's actually a game rather than a social distraction because the rules/scoring will encourage people to properly match their sheep with attributes or lose points. (3) It's pretty quick, it accommodates a large number of people and is pretty compact (if you don't bother with the actual box) with no pen/paper required for score keeping.

People often compare this to Dixit.  Here are few reasons to own both or to just acquire Attribute: (1) Dixit will need more picture cards and a lot sooner than Attribute would need more attribute cards. (2) Attribute is cheaper! (3) It's easier/quicker to come up with a word association about a random topic of your choice than divining 'just the right' clue about an abstract picture. (4) Attribute accommodates more players.  (5) Overall, Attribute also seems to have a lot more comedic/funny moments compared to Dixit which tends to be more reflective/creative which gives it greater general appeal.

I think the biggest disadvantage of the game is that it can be hard to position players in such a way that it's easy for everyone to have easy access to any persons card when everyone reveals their attributes during the quick-time event of the round.

Played once.  The game is similar to Apples to Apples, but there's a bit more going on.  Sometimes you want a player to take your card, so you're trying to match your adjective to the noun, and sometimes you don't want your card taken, so you're looking for the opposite.  It's OK, but doesn't excite me.

This is Apples to Apples done correctly. Instead of having a judge who can pick cards based on pure whim (which really turns the game into an exercise in frustration), everyone's trying to match their cards with the colored sheep they receive. There's more strategy than A2A,  objective scoring, and endless replayability (since you choose your own topics instead of having the game do it for you). And it's more forgiving with people who may not know each other extremely well, since there's no opportunity for the abuse of in-jokes and insider knowledge that makes A2A so ridiculous. 

This is definitely one of the better party games out there--quick to learn, easy to play, and can support a large number of players. Don't even consider A2A if you can buy Attribute instead.

[b]Update:[/b] Dropped from a 7 to a 6. I think some of the fun does depend on the group playing; it isn't always guaranteed enjoyment.

More fun than something like Apples to Apples, really enjoyed playing this several times, being able to come up with categories makes it very humorous.  
The scoring is flawed so I prefer the original German scoring mentioned [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/179055]here[/url], where you also get: +1/-1 point if your card got slapped and you held a green/red sheep (although this game is more about the social experience than the scoring anyway.)  
Another [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/321340]house rule[/url]: no commenting on your card once you've flipped it over, although commenting on others cards is allowed!  Also, no retracting slaps once they're done!

Excellently fun little party card game.  I haven't played too many party card games I like, but I do like this.  One thing though, is everyone has to sit around a table so they can be able to grab each other's cards - timing is important, here.  You're better off not worrying too much about points or exact number of rounds.  Just play till everyone has had fun with it and gets tired of it then move on to something else.  For what it is, we have a great time.

Replay wise, it doesn't matter if you've gone through all the cards.  The topics people choose make the game, and there will always be a different combination of adjectives and red or green sheep.

The theme is sheep, but I don't see the connection--sheep have nothing to do with the game.  Very similar to Apples to Apples, which I like much better.  The other players did like it, so I guess I would call it a good family game, and a game where socializing is acceptable.

RATING: 9
[Word association] [4P+: 9] Pretty good party game, played for laughs. I like it much better than the overrated Apples to Apples. Players have a hand of adjective cards, and are dealt a sheep card. Green sheep tells you that you want to match an adjective to the "noun of the round". Black sheep tells you that you DON'T want to match it. The start player gives a "noun of the round". Players toss their adjectives onto the table simultaneously, then grab one that they think matches the "noun of the round". If you're slow, you miss out. Sheep are then revealed. If you have a green sheep and someone took your card you score a point. If you have a black sheep and someone took your card you lose a point. If you took a card that someone with a green sheep played you earn a point. If you took a card that someone with a black sheep played you lose a point. If you didn't take a card, you gain nothing but lose nothing. Attribute is fun because you can be creative with your noun of the round. Sometimes, your cards force you to be creative. All in all, not bad for a 30-minute filler. *** UPDATE: Talk about underestimation. Attribute is one of the best games in my collection. It's everything a party game needs to be. It's simple, intelligent, funny, fast, flexible and ultra-portable. It's got incredible staying power because the PLAYERS provide the heart of the game - you can NEVER run out of topics. We've played with as few as four and as many as eight players, gamers and non-gamers alike. I'll be damned if anyone doesn't have a good time playing Attribute with friends. If Attribute 2 is ever released in English, I'll move heaven & earth to get me a copy. If you have any love for party games, word games or just plain great games, you've got to get a copy of Attribute. Highly, highly recommended. Apples to Apples is a poor slip of a shadow compared to Attribute - sell your copy of Apples to Apples to a thrift shop and get Attribute. You'll not miss Apples to Apples for a second.

Even though the box is a lot smaller than Apples to Apples, it is actually more replayable in that you have an infinite number of words to try and describe your cards - since you pick them yourself.  There is a little more strategy, but the Z-Man rules also give a strong advantage to the player who gets dealt a lot of red sheep cards.  This can be fixed with a variant.

Nice game with plenty of laughs, but I wish the scoring were a bit less of a chore (when using the advanced scoring).  Regarding Attribute vs. Apples to Apples:  Attribute is better overall, and more fun with my regular gaming group, but Apples to Apples goes over better with non-gamers.  Attribute is more replayable because the topics are created by the players and therefore don't grow stale.

The easiest way to score is to place your red/green sheep card face down under your word card.  Makes it very easy and obvious who is gaining/losing points.  Then just collect any old card from that round of play (sheep or words) to represent a point.

Simple and fast and cool party game.  You do well if other players agree with you that your adjective card matches or doesn't match the topic in question.  Is Britney Spears squishy or not?

RATING: 6.5

Condition: played 3 times, cards are clean and in excellent condition.

===Second comment:

When people play to win, they tend to choose boring topics ("a chair", "air", "plants") just because it suits the cards they have in their hand. It is only a fun game if everyone tries their best to come up with potentially funny or absurd topics. This is better as a drinking game.

===First comment:

This is a HILARIOUS game. It's more fun NOT trying to pick a topic that relates to one of your cards. Just say a topic that evokes imagery good or bad and let the attribute cards make the jokes for you. A great way to end a night of gaming with a hearty laugh. 

IF YOU ARE TEACHING THIS GAME: If you describe this game in the abstract, people will not want to play it! My suggestion is not to say anything at all at first. Just deal the cards out. Tell them what to do if they have a red or green card. Then tell everyone what to try and grab. Then once all the grabs are done, go around the table one person at a time and explain the scoring.

[Initial Impression: 7] So simple it almost feels like it is not a game at all, but absolutely uproarious fun! Each player is dealt a green or red card which governs whether they should supply a descriptor that matches or doesn't match the "target" noun named by the start player. Players then grab cards that match - taking a card from a green-card holder gains you and that player one point each; taking from a red-card holder loses a point each, and players whose cards weren't taken get one point added (for red cards) or subtracted (green cards). That's the game, which can take many players at once. It is great fun to try to make the best fit (or non-fit) from your limited set of cards, to guess whether others will agree with your match/non-match judgment, and to just laugh at some of the bizarre combos. In our game, it was hilarious to see the descriptors applied to Paris Hilton! (I bet you could make some great variants by requiring all "targets" to be public figures or some other wide-scope category.)

Extremely fun game and almost instantly replaced Apples to Apples as favourite party game among my friends.  Most fun is to use other players or family and friends as the "category".  Hilarious moments include a guy calling out his own name as category and his girlfriend placing down "Improvable" as a green-sheep adjective... or when someone placed "bi*chy" down when someone called out their dog as the category.

1st played 10/18/07. Taught in ~5min, played in ~30min w/ 6 players. Attribute has good luck/strategy balance. The goal is to have the most points(pts) at the end of a round (all player deal once). Pts are awarded for accurately guessing whether or not another player's card played matches topic chosen. Deck consist of descriptive(adjectives) word cards. Each player gets 4 cards & either a green(plus) or red(minus) sheep card. If you draw a green card, you need to pick a card from your hand that best matches topic. If you draw red, pick a card that doesn't match. Dealer's left chooses & calls out a topic(noun). Players secretly decide which of their 4 cards to play that matches their drawn green/red card. Once all have chosen, all cards are flip at the same time and immediately each player races to slaps another player's card if they think that player has a green card. Pts are earned for correct matches (green) or if no one guessed a player's red card. Pts are deducted if players slap a red card or played a red slapped card. Use green cards slapped or red cards unslapped for score. Collect & shuffle green/red cards, then refil hands to 4 cards. It's worth a gameplay if you know someone who has it, otherwise I'd only purchase if you are in a need of a new party game.

RATING: 5
This game is very similar to Apples to Apples, consequently carrying most of its problems, while also introducing the totally new and horrid mechanic of speed grabbing.  The grabbing itself pretty much kills it for me, otherwise I'd probably like it quite a deal more.  As a party game it succeeds in being fun, generating funny table talk, and stimulating group think.  Unfortunately enough, the whole aforementioned grabbing thing and fact that some players can actively screw up scoring sinks it for me big time.

RATING: 5.9
Aug08: Well, after picking it up and seeing the components, I feared I had a dud on my hands.  However, it turned out to be a lot of fun!

The scoring was definitely the tricky part, but not that bad.  I really enjoyed making my own topics.  And the red versus green sheep cards added some real decisions to the game.

If you're at least open to Apples to Apples style games, then you should consider taking a look at Attribute.

Very simple rules, but for some reason takes new people forever to figure out. Can be funny with the right people.  Quick and you can play for as long or short as you want.  Since it sets up in a second it is a good game to bring out while waiting everyone to group.

I love a good party game and was looking forward to this after reading some comments/reviews but after first play I'm a little disappointed. I was playing with the right type of group for this but it just didn’t spark the kind of laughter and fun I was hoping for that other games of this type do.  Maybe we weren’t making strange enough topics, not sure, but because the answers are choices from a premade deck and not ones the people themselves come up with maybe this is why it comes out the way it does. I'll hopefully try it again but its not as good as I was hoping, I might actually like Balderdash better just because you come up with answers and sometimes they are very funny.

I enjoy this game more than Apples to Apples, because of the speed mechanism (grabbing another player's pile), and the need to form both likely and unlikely adjective/noun combinations.  I also enjoy the fact that you can make up your categories, which is more fun for imaginative groups.

Its a word-association party game. Players attempt to link words to free-form topics. My problem was that it never really reached the "fun" point. There were a few moments of laughter as someone picked a word by mistake, but nothing memorable. Also, the scoring system was horrible. I understand the need for having such a complex scoring system, but it really did slow down the game.

Fun game.  It's a good party game, the kind you just enjoy regardless of how it turns out.  Bought the Z-man edition when it came out a couple of years after I first played it - that box is just way too big (I like small boxes), but it works.  My kids think it's an especially hilarious game.

Like most party games, the enjoyement you'll get out of this one will greatly depend on the people you're playing wiht. On average, I found Attribut to be easier to get into and create funny situations than Apple to Apple, and would be my game of choice in the "word association" party game sub-genre.

Very creative word game. Conveying information about colour of a card has never been this much fun. I have a home-made Finnish edition; I'd like to buy the original at some point to support the author, but a game like this must be played in one's own language for the best effect.

I'm game for a little word association, but the luck of the draw in the goal (red or green) cards is frustrating here. It's a lot easier to see how the words in your hand are not associated with whatever word someone else has selected on their turn. Therefore, as long as you keep drawing red cards, you'll do well. Start drawing green, and you suck. It might be interesting to give everyone the same number of green and red cards to start the game, and you have to pick which one you're going with on any given turn.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Assigned either red or green card. Active player picks a word and you either match (green) or oppose (red) the word. Cards are flipped simultaneously and you try to slap a card you think is green.  Points assigned if right/wrong and if your card was chosen or not.

Sounds like a more objective apples to apples.

All of the fun of Apples to Apples or Cards Against Humanity backed up by scoring rules that actually give the game a point.

A little like Apples to Apples. Players have word cards in hand and are secretly dealt a positive or negative sheep card. A topic is chosen and each player chooses either a word that they hope will get picked as linked to the topic (positive sheep card) or a word that is ignored (negative sheep).
There is then some card grabbing once the words are revealed.
Points are awarded if you grabbed a card that was a positive to the topic, also if your positive word was grabbed, or your negative word was ignored.
Points are lost for grabbed negative words or ignored positives!
Scoring can be a little hard to get your head arround initially, but a couple of rounds usually clears it up.
Ok game for the right sort of occasion.

This game is like apples to apples but a little bit more involved.  The problem with that is that apples to apples is fun for when you want as little involvement as possible, just to pick cards and laugh, etc.  So I'm not sure adding more "Game" to apples to apples is worth while.  I enjoy it, but I could see people playing this and thinking "why bother with this extra complication, let's just play apples to apples"

Like any other party game, how much fun you have depends on the group you're playing it with. Attribute's structure creates the incentive to remain goofy while still matching things in a somewhat serious fashion, with no incentive to pick something that doesn't match (because you'll lose a point!). I worry about destroying its box.

RATING: 6
English Language Edition - Hard to believe that a simple thing like green(white)/red(black) sheep and the ability to choose the topic make to a game.  This is what Apples to Apples should have been.  The decision to grab a card (or none) to anticipate what others have played is what elevates this above the rotating pseudo-random judging of A2A. But like most party games, really depends on the crowd you are playing with to get the most enjoyment out of it.

Currently one of my favourite two party games (along with Taboo).  A fun combination of word-matching and how-fast-can-you-grab that can play as dirty or as clean as the group would like.  (I'm trying to think of a word to go with "horny"...  a toad!)  The scoring rules that come in the English rulebook are positively bizarre, so use the BSW scoring variant instead (i.e. the scoring method for the original German version).  Comes in a tiny box, so eminently portable.

Like Apples to Apples in reverse, but with broken scoring.  Drawing white sheep cards is always bad for you (either you lose points or someone else gains them), while black sheep are always good for you (either you gain points or someone else loses them).  Thus, drawing white sheep is a miserable experience, and winning can hinge on random draws instead of the supposed gameplay.

With house rules to balance out the cards you get, such as everyone playing on both a white AND and a black sheep each round (but not revealing which is which), or guaranteeing balance with N of each card per person over 2N rounds, it's okay, but nothing special.

No strategy involved: just hope you draw red sheep or have something that matches the topic... blegh. No room for creativity either, aside from raising a topic, which is weird since you also get to play against your topic.

Confusing scoring rules + lack of a drum-roll/reveal process (everybody just looks at what they grabbed and scored appropriate points without a central 'checking' process) also engender a quiet environment that doesn't behoove a party game.

Fantastic Party Game!  One part Apples to Apples, one part Slapjack!  Lots of fun.  The more the merrier (kinda slow and broken with three). I confess I created my own deck.  I'll buy it if they come out with blank booster cards.  If you want a couple party games in your collection, this is a must.  You need to thin the red sheep down by a third to keep the game more inspiring.

This is the game Apples to Apples wants to be. It's so much better--it has a point. It's rare to be caught with what feels like a useless card, there's less sucking up to the judge, and there's less frustration when your well-chosen card is ignored.

RATING: 6
A party game. One deck has cards with a word on each: deal 4/player. The other has red or green sheep: each round, deal 1/player (all face down). Players take turns picking a word or phrase (eg edible underwear). Everyone picks one of their cards that matches (if they got a green sheep - eg chocolate) or doesn't match (red sheep - eg GWBush): these are revealed simultaneously. Then everyone races to grab a card (but not their own) that matches, although you may choose not to grab anything ... it's very much like Apples to Apples except that you have to / get to come up with your own catagories. Points are awarded based on what you grabbed and the card you played: you earn 1pt if you had a red sheep and no one took your card, and/or you grabbed a card that someone with a green sheep played. You lose a pt (negative pts possible) if you had a green sheep but no one took your card, and/or if you grabbed a red-sheep card. Play a certain number of rounds.

This is much better on BSW, where there's some anonymity and the topics are a lot more interesting (ie risque). It would also be better with people you know well and are comfortable with. With a bunch of new people, it was not as good - it feels like more work creating phrases. It was esp bad for us since no one knew the rules really well!

6/10 but higher if you like Apples to Apples and play with a group of friends.

[Lookout "Attribute" English 2nd 2002 edition] {Party, word; word association, creativity, voting, real-time; optimal 6p or more} Attribute is a very fun party word game. It's fast-faced and there are loads of player interactions in the game!  IMHO, it's a cheaper and smaller alternative to Apples to Apples. Attribute is good for children to build vocabulary. It's not very accessible for non-English players because some words are uncommon. I think it'd be funnier for English-speaking players.

The fun of this game relies very much on the ability of a player in naming subjects. If the player is indecisive and takes a long time to select a trivial/boring subject, Attribute round won't be funny.

[variant] I usually use the variant scoring rule to increase the excitement because players could have negative scores. In addition, it encourages players to pick a card more wisely because a player will lose 2pts if his attribute card is not grabbed when he has green sheep card / will gain 2 pts if his attribute card is grabbed when he has red sheep card.

[Update] Z-man reprinted this game. There are no new cards in this edition. The box is horribly larger. I skip it.

This one was a surprise! I got this in the Chain of Generosity along with a copy of RftG, and I had sort of expected it to be one of those games that never got played in my group. Party games, in general, are not terribly popular at game nights. But Attribute's come out a few times and has been a blast to play whenever it has. Sure, the scoring system's a bit weird and people who are dealt a black sheep have a possible scoring advantage over those who are dealt a white one. But who cares? The game's filled with laughter and crazy across-the-table slapping, and people generally ask to let the game continue an extra round or two, which means it's got to be pretty good in my book.

I really like this game.  It causes great hilarity when people can't find suitable combinations of words and have to settle for some strange mixture.  However, the scoring system takes a bit of getting used to and confuses quite a lot of people on fist exposure to it.  It is a shame because I find relatively few people I know want to play it.  It is often confusion over scoring that puts them off.

Not about winning and losing, just fun.

I like it better than Apples to Apples, but it is slightly harder to teach than A2A and requires people to come up with their own subjects which is a turn-off to some.

Update: Dixit really kills this one for me, but it is still fun and likely more replayable than Dixit, so I will keep it around for now.



Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 5
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 5
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 4

Fun party game. If you're played out on Apples to Apples, this is a good alternative.

Great party game that finally made the leap from www.brettspielwelt.de to the Real World - it's all about interaction, not winning or losing.

Similar to Apples to Apples, so it only works with the right group of people in the right mood, but at the right time and the right place this is a real gem.  It's significantly better than Apples to Apples because it has objective rather than subjective scoring!

Very comparable to Apples to Apples, of course. Doesn't have that game's programmed-in cultural references, which is both bad (they're sometimes very entertaining) and good (much more scope for creativity, accessible to a wider audience).

Very fun party game. Goes well once people grasp the way scoring works.  Once over that hump, alot of fun to be had!

Like playing Apples to Apples but with more twist...  Great party game for large groups and not necessarily hardcore tabletop gamers.

Played just two games. With the right people this must be fun.

A convoluted version of Apples to Apples.  Not good enough to eclipse that game.

I gave this to Terri for Christmas 04.  It is a little more of a game than Apples to Apples, but some of the simplicity is lost, too.  It ends up about even in my eyes.

Not played with proper rules - only a kind of Apples-to-Apples with free choice of topic.  Well worth the purchase just for that.

Really fun game, a bit more thinky than Apples to Apples, and the speed element in this is a bit more fun. Thinking up topics is something I find fun, but a couple people seem to dislike it (but c'mon, just look around the room, it's not hard - shoes, your hair, television, facial scarring). Scoring is a bit confusing, so I reverted to the German rules with some changes.

Includes: Blank Cards

Just a couple plays, but people don't seem to be as into it as I thought they'd be.  Given away on The Chain.

This is a fun game of creative comparisons. I enjoy the game, though the speed component to it can sometimes be irksome.

Clever enough A2A spinoff. Wears out quickly.

As a game, it's ok, but far from mindblowing. I mostly use it in class for language teaching, and that's why I got it.

A fun party game that's somewhat the reverse of Apples to Apples in how it plays, but being able to choose a category adds juice to the game and makes it an easy choice over A2A. I've now adopted a house rule that the category chooser can't look at his or her new cards before choosing the category; this keeps the player from choosing a sure match, which makes everyone race to claim that care first.

I find it hard to slap the cards, especially with more people...

Reminiscent of Apples to Apples; Not quite as intuitive to learn, but at least as much fun.

Played mostly on BSW (French and English). A nice party game, which draws most of its fun from the weird themes and awkward justifications - which means you have to play it with the right players. Planning to make a French set with the blank cards I got at Essen 2006.

Love it! My husband and I have played it with diverse groups of people, and everyone has loved it, from my mom, sister, and brother to our best friends.

We like to choose a category or theme for our words. Our favorite is "mythological or legendary creatures." We play D&D, so it gives us great options...as well as real insite into the (warped) minds of our friends and family. "Buoyant" trolls? Come on! And who suggests "Succubus" when her mom is playing? (My own sister, apparently...)

Basically, the better your imagination and vocabulary, the better you will do. And the your friends, the more fun everyone will have.

LOVE LOVE this game... I hate to say it but it might just be better to play on BSW.  Clicking instead of grabbing cards is alot easier!  The whole purpose of this game is to have lots of FUN, but it's good to do well too.

Naughty Attribut ROCKS!!!

Great game as an opener for the night, it could get a little monotonous though. Also bad for players with weak language skills.
Update:
One group I play with really seems to "get" the game and that just makes it better. It turns into a raucous party game

Perhaps my favorite Party Game after Cranium Hoopla. Fun, engaging, and more frenetic and compelling to me than Apples ot Apples. For some reason, some folks have difficulty grokking whether they want to make a good or bad match. The only real downside is if you get a Red Sheep the turn you get to call the topic, you're virtually guaranteed one point, and have a great shot at two... However, since it rotates around the table, that's balanced out. Great fun.

After 1 Play: This may as well be called Apples to Apples: Gamer Edition.  I while I like that concept, the game struggles to find an audience because of it.  With non-gamers I'd say just stick to AtA, as they are not going to appreciate the more interesting scoring.  But in my experience, many gamers are reluctant to play party games - especially one similar to Apples to Apples.  None of this is a slight against the game itself.  I think the game is good, I just don't see having many opportunities to play it.

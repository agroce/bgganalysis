See Fluxx - but with a Oz spin. 

This is my least favorite version of Fluxx. I don't know why it is, but games of this seem to go on longer than normal.

This game gets points in my book just for being completely unique! Who ever thought of a game that begins with no particular objective? It's like "Calvin Ball: The Card Game"! Rather addicting, too--now I want to try Star Fluxx, too.

NEW: Now that I have been collecting/playing board games for about a year, I can finally pin point what it is that I don't actually like about this game. It has a high potential to get too complicated for what it is. Sure, it's portable.  And sure, the rules are easy to explain. But once more rules get added, people who like simple card games have to be guided and reminded far to often for this to be enjoyable. It feels like it's supposed to be great for your average dinner party group, but that feeling wears off quickly as the game progresses. Cool mechanic. I wouldn't lower my score because this is still a solid game. But the theme and gameplay are not appealing to my more experienced group and it escalates quickly in complexity with typical non-gamers which leaves me doing far too much explaining and babying.

This game is fun.  It's not great, but it's good family fun.  It is a hectic game with a lot of time and energy spent keeping the rules and goals straight.  I suspect it gets better when played with people who do not need to have everything explained every turn.

Yet another Fluxx.  My wife and brother and law simply love fluxx and all the themes.  I don't mind them, but no longer seek them out.  The Oz theme is another that works well for the Fluxx world.  I'll say this: they choose good themes and blend them pretty well into their mechanics.

RATING: 8
I bought this for my (adult) daughter last Christmas and we played it tons of times.  She couldn't get enough of it.  I've also played Star Fluxx (once) and Monty Python Fluxx a few times, but found this one seems better by far than the other two.  The gameplay seems to flow a lot easier somehow.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The only reason I have this one is because I'm a big Oz universe nerd. I bought it event tho I do not think those illustration are even good. I do not think it's the best Fluxx version, if I had to chose only one, I wouldn't even think of this one for a second. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Similar to Pirate Fluxx... low Creeper density, Surprises included, and no new mechanics, but not as much player interaction.  Harder to get rid of Creepers.  Less complexity on the individual cards.  Fewer Keepers that "do things" makes it easier for kids.  On the other hand, some of the New Rules and Actions seem more complicated than ever (especially The Golden Cap), so maybe not as kid-friendly.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
The only way to win is not to play.

However, the specially designed turn marker that ships with the store's promo copies is one of the finest heavy enamel coins I have ever seen.  That coin is a true heirloom item for gamers and non-gamers a like.  Acquire the turn marker at any cost.

I did not enjoy this one quite as much as some of the other Fluxx variations.  I think it might have been because there are more cards in it that are goofier than the other games, making it feel like it was directed towards a younger audience.

One of the Fluxx series of games with a Wizard of Oz theme.  A very light, whimsical card game, where the rules of the game change as it progresses.  Trust me, it makes sense when you play it.

Although a good addition to the Fluxx family, the balance of card types feels off. In two plays (with plenty of shuffling) we ended up with a total of two rule changes, tons of keepers/creepers, goals, and just a few actions.

Not sure how to rate this. Fluxx is a chaotic, silly game that probably doesn't fit into what most "serious" gamers enjoy... chaotic and silly fun has it's place though. Plus I'm a sucker for the Oz theme.

Can't imagine it coming off the shelf unless the group at my table can't handle a more strategic game - but that happens often enough to make it worth keeping.

Super fun game to play with a group of people or just between 2 players.  The game more often that not plays very quickly.  So far everyone I have played with has enjoyed the Wizard of Oz theme.  I bought this as a surprise gift for my wife who loves the Wizard of Oz.  So far she is always willing to play when suggested.

If you've played Fluxx, you know what to expect.  If you have not, you basically are trying to accomplish goals and change rules in your favor to win the game.  This game features a Wizard of Oz theme where with a special promo card and some courage, you can draw more cards by singing songs from the movie the Wizard of Oz.  Fun and hilarity abound with this version as with other versions.  Great game for a mixed group of people looking for something to do in their downtime.

I like Fluxx, but I like versions that add something new. Oz Fluxx adds nothing that wasn't already present in the most recent version of Fluxx. In other words, aside from the art, what's the point?

RATING: 7.5
I was pleasantly surprised by this one.  I'm not a huge fan of the Oz mythos or theme, but the cards work well and the games have a good flow.  This is one of the few Fluxx flavors (along with Zombie) where I thought the creepers added to the game rather than being a random punishment or frustration.

It's become my son's favorite Fluxx as well and he doesn't even really care much about the Oz books or movies.

Many years ago I played Fluxx at a friend's house and didn't like it.  I remember thinking that the game was too 'random'.  For $2 I decided to purchase Oz Fluxx and give it another go.  Well, I liked it despite losing 3 times in a row (damn Creepers!).  Perhaps it was the Oz theme (I love the Wizard of Oz) or perhaps it was who I was gaming with or perhaps my taste in games has evolved (or devolved).  In any case, I thoroughly enjoyed how quick and light-hearted the game was, while still being competitive with lots of play combinations.  It's the PERFECT filler game as well as, in our case, the perfect nightcap for game night.

12/12/17 Played a four-player game. We played for 19 minutes and did not finish. My opinion of Oz Fluxx was mildly favorable. For a newbie like me there was an awful lot of reading to do with every hand of cards. (Whereas the old hands pretty much knew at a glance what each card did and how best to use it..) Therefore I was basically playing blind. The card art was amusing, but not silly. The card text was clear; yet there was just too much of it for me to absorb enough of to form a viable strategy as a new player. I was given the impression the multitude of other Fluxx incarnations varied only in theme. In summary, Oz Fluxx was not as bad as I'd feared.  I'd play it again, but not too often.

The Fluxx I use as an intro one for friends before I move onto "harder" versions. It has the different cards (except Ungoals) but few of the Keepers or Creepers have special powers, so it's easier to keep track of everything (compared to for example Star or Cthulhu)

I was bound to pick up a copy of Fluxx sooner or later, since it is such a classic filler game. Oz Fluxx ranks 8th of the 30 or so versions of Fluxx out there, including delights such as Chemistry Fluxx, Jewish Fluxx and Spanish Fluxx (the last one sounding like a Renaissance disease). Given my choice I would probably have picked about 20 others before it, but when I found it new in shrink wrap for $1 at a garage sale, well, how could I go wrong?

One year later and it is now a favorite for my 13, 12, and 8 year olds.   Easy to take traveling - fun everywhere...  in airports, while waiting for dinner, camping, in hotel, etc.  8 ur. old even wins a fair share so easy to pick up.   FUN THEME

Why we culled it: See my commentary on the core edition of Fluxx for more details. The short version is that Fluxx is a fine background activity that doesn't have a relevant niche in our collection, so we found it a better home.

THE wargame. More of a hobby than a game. It's famous. It's infamous. Everyone knows of it.
So many armies and so much variety within each of them (I run a norseman-werewolf themed Warriors of Chaos list). Sometimes I think I enjoy the modelling/painting end even more than the game itself.

Outrageous geek-tastic gonzo-violent setting. Cool minis if you ever have the time to paint them. Players are given plenty of opprotunity to customize and personalize their army providing for a surprising amount of personal expression and emotional involvement.

But the [i]game[/i] is terrible. Freeform movement rules turn it more into performance art than a competition of wits. And the IGO/UGO has got to go.

See also Warhammer 40K.

2010-04-14 (rating 6):

An OK game.

But the rules although not easy and changing often are not very good either. Often I think they result in play which is not very realistic. Also often we arrive at situations which are not covered by the rules (or not covered enough). And armies are unbalanced in my opinion.

Also this is a hobby rather than just a game. And I don't like the other part beside the game. I don't like modelling or painting. I do appreciate battles with numerous beautifully painted miniatures and fine looking playground. But I don't want (and I am unable) to achieve it myself and buying all that is expensive.

The game is quite expensive.

Il problema di questo gioco è che richiedeva tantissimi soldi per essere competitivo e anche molto spazio per la collezione. Mi piaceva, ci avrei giocato spesso e volentieri e all'epoca (parliamo di 20 anni fa) collezionavo anche le riviste White Dwarf e le espansioni

The biggest part of the fun is in pregame preparations when you are composing your army for the battle that lies ahead. The playing part is also fun. However, I hate the amount of cash you have to spend to collect that army. I also hate the constant rule revisions.

Warhammer is one of those games that become more like a hobby than just a game for occasional playing. You can spend infernal amounts of time and money into building, painting, customising and showcasing your armies. The more you invest the more you love the game. 

As to the game itself, the juiciest lure is in choosing the right army for each battle. That is the moment when you lay the foundation for your basic strategy, and in principle the events on the table are just direct consequences of the pre-battle choices. Of course, you need to have eye for tactics since there is quite a bit of room for chance in the game (read, lot of dice rolling).

The first miniatures wargame I ever played, this is a very detailed game with a lot of rules, although simple to learn. The drawback of this game for me is its HUGE money pit, just like every GW minis game, but very enjoyable nonetheless. Fortunately, the Warbands rules are fun and make the game much more affordable.

Even though I've got some reservations calling this game a "boardgame" (it is as much a hobby as it is a game) it fascinates me everytime I play it. The latest edition (8th) is nice, but not the best I've played.
However, this game needs money (a lot) time (a lot) and patience (a lot - every true army has to be painted!)

I like wargames, and I like scale model building. Thus it is a pretty fun game for me. It is true that this game is a marketing scheme, it is also true that the miniatures are overpriced (way too expensive). It is also true that the rules are way too out-dated (you-go, I-go, lot of downtime waiting for moves etc.) I have play some games with annoying teenagers whose main goal in the game to bad-mouth the opponent, while some games with an opponent that don't know the rules and cheat. Nothing the less, one have to value the impact of Warhammer to the general hobby. It has introduce alot of new fresh players to the world of gaming (otherwise they may go for video games etc). It has the best marketing on the gaming industry, and it is not hard to find players to play (though quality of the players is another issue). Plus it help game store survives on the current market.

The only player input is in the initial deployment, and buying shiny stuff for your heroes. After that, it's only a matter of closing to melee and roll those myriad dice until the dust settles and one player is the victor.

I have the very first edition, that was both RPG and wargame in a single box. I liked it quite a lot, but somehow I found it worse in the later editions. As a 3D wargame, there are much better systems... And the world is not coherent from an edition to the nexts.

100% nostalgia for a game that I loved but kind of spurned me, like all the Italian girls in high school with the big butts. 

Moving a bunch of painted dudes across a field of homemade terrain was just the greatest feeling, even if it usually went to hell quickly when someone's army just started running for it at the drop of a hat or some random-ass magical misfire result. 

Still have my lizardmen in the closet, which only gets harder to justify to my wife.

Happily got out of the game. Power creep was getting way out of hand and the elitist players/extreme fanboys (the kind that make GW out to be some sort of deity that can do no wrong) I kept meeting made me hate the game. The extreme price gouging didn't help either.

This, like most modern GW games, suffers from over-powerful (and over-expensive) additions made for the younger players to drool upon. However, this is a fun game (and a hobby in itself) when played with "sensible" armies (and people).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
De facto fantasy miniatures wargame rules, multiple editions and high price point make entry into this game difficult.  Also the daunting nature of paint your own miniatures and build your own terrain can be off putting.  All of this can be done slightly less expensively and fairly easily (contact me if you would like to discuss).  All that being said, the "fantasy theme" for this set is incredibly well executed.  Rate as an 8 if considering "Warhammer in a Flash".

I love Warhammer.  I have my 5,000 points of Dark Elves, 3,000 points of Empire, and 2,000 points of the new Ogre Kingdoms.  A strategic, and fun game, and a great hobby to get into.  Downsides are that games take 4 or so hours to play, and in bigger battles, the time rises exponentially.  Recommended though.

I like tabletop wargames, and WHFB 6th edition is probably the best of class.  The rules are fairly easy to learn.  The biggest downer is the cost- this is an expensive and time-consuming hobby: by the time you're done buying your army and codex books you'll have dropped at least $300 and you'll need to spend some serious time painting everyone up.

The number of times I've played this game prior to BoardGameGeek numbers in the hundreds. My history with Warhammer is a long and tired one, but here are the highlights:

Sometime in 7th grade, I saw some people playing Battletech at school. I headed down to my local game shop and asked the shop owner about "That cool game with the miniatures". He pointed me to Warhammer 40k. I knew it wasn't the right game, but looked pretty cool, and played it for a couple of years.

Eventually, one of my best friends - Alex - introduced me to the world of Fantasy Battle. What intrigued me is that while 40k was a game of dice rolls (did cover even matter in 3rd edition? After all, if you were in it deep enough to benefit, the you also suffered from soft cover penalties) WFB was a game of movement, positioning, and flanking. Sure, dice rolls would play a big role but that could be evened out by careful positioning.

Soon after, i had a decent Orc force. I began working at a game shop, which gave me ample time to begin painting my minis, and I was able to run tournaments - allowing me to sit in on a ton of games to substitute for no-shows.

Soon, my buddy Alex and I were running weekly games of upwards of 4000 - 5000 points. I had a High Elf army, and he ran a Vampire Counts army. This was mid-6th edition, and VCs were horribly broken. I was never able to procure a win against his Vampire Counts, but was able to easily trounce his Dark Elves. Just shows how beardy the VCs were back then.

College eventually came and I had a lot less time for Warhammer, but since college has ended I've dabbled here and there. I've started a modest dwarf force and have slowly assembled and begun painting it. I guess we'll see when (if ever) I get to field it.

Warhammer itself - the game (if you can call it that, as its more of a hobby) is rather balanced. So many dice rolls in a game mean that you get a decent distribution of dice, and even if you're plagued by horrible dice rolls, you can generally pull a game out by utilizing decent tactics. While it is a game that I won't necessarily always want to play, it is a game that if I have the TIME for I'll try to squeeze one in.

--- 

I'll have to downgrade this based on the new rules set...

Terribly slow and cumbersome battle game. After four hours of playtime, most units are still in the same positions. Here and there a single wound is scored but not much else happens. Incredibly boring game, that really only gets playable after spending hundreds upon hundreds of dollars on miniatures. Also, special characters are WAY too strong compared to normal foot soldiers, and you can have an unbalancingly high amount of those leaders in your army.

Although I like historical wargames more, this game is an exception. Fantasy wargaming has its charm. It's a real wargame though. Very good and clear rules. You always end up with new surprising tactics and magic stuff. Short playing time, but a lot of investment in assembling an army. Ogre army, Tomb Kings and Empire troops, 2000 points each. Each 2000 point army will cost you about 500 to 600 Euro, books included.
I think that the rotating of new Army books (every army book changes after 5 to 6 years), is quite positive. It keeps the game fresh. 
To those complaining about it, which computer game is still being played after 5 years ? Answer None. In Warhammer at least a dwarf stays a dwarf and a skeleton stays a skeleton.

I had to correct this last sentence: I now play World of Warcraft since 2006 on a daily basis and loving it as much - if not even more - than 5 years ago...

Fun for nostalgia sake.  I played this one into the ground starting with 3rd edition.  That was a fantastic book, and Warhammer Armies was the quintessential followup release for me.  I poured over that book day in and day out looking at the armies, devising new army lists, making armies I could never afford, not to mention find mini's for (Pygmies and Slann anyone?).  Loved this game, and it never really loved me back.  I will never again say "Knights Panther" or "Frostblade" without chills running down my back because of JP and his God forsaken Empire army....

Current edition is garbage.  GW manages to muck up every game they try to "improve".  The only decent version of this game was 3rd. Edition from the early 80's, it actually played very well and the points system actually worked, I would have give IT a 7.  Now they are on like the 23rd. Edition or something ridiculous and they still haven managed to get it as good as that earlier one.  Requires TONS of miniatures to play, lot of time consumed making terrain and a passive look at any type of game balance.  GW's design team is a bunch of guys in the back room going, "Yeah, that would be cool!!!"  To top it off, they make their minis in ridiculous proportions so other companies minis don't mix well with them.  I cut my losses a few years ago and got out of 25mm Fantasy Armies, I now play only 10mm.  Warhammer Fantasy Battle claims it's a mass battle game, but it isn't...it isn't a tactical game either.  It really doesn't work as either.  What you end up with is tons of cool miniatures and load of moronic D6 rolling.  Here's what I mean about poor design and planning...The points system from 3rd Edition to the current edition haven't changed a bit BUT GW has managed to radically change the mechanics of the game and make inexpensive troops MUCH more effective in combat yet their points never changed to reflect this.   Which is why the points system in WFB is broken all to hell.   Move on to something else, spend the $100's on a ton of good board games or even a good miniature game.  Check out GW's Warmaster, for some strange reason it's seemed to escape all this garbage and turns out to be a damn good game.

RATING: 7
More complex than its futuristic counterpart, due to the extra mechanics required to govern the movement and combat of ranked units. Once again for those who enjoy the theme, it is an excellent game. The latest version (V7) is something of a disappointment, the rules for individual scenarios have been removed and replaced with a more complex pitched battle. I personally think that it's not a great idea, I prefer to have to make an army that can do anything (Pitched Battle, Meeting Engagement, Flank Attack, Breathrough, etc)

Actual rules for battle are simplistic yet fail to create a fast paced game. The points system puts too much emphasis on lone heroes with game breaking items. But the background story and atmosphere of the Warhammer world is excellent and the associated Citadel miniatures are second to none.

Also, while I am no big fan of the rules, they still let you adopt subtle strategies and reward predicting your opponent, like any good strategy game should.

While games with experienced and firm-but-fair GMs can be fun, most of the time it's a rules lawyer's "gotcha!" fest. Too many editions change the balance and flavor of the game and you have to be fanatical about Games Workshop's brand of fantasy miniatures wargaming to begin to get a grasp on it. Bump this up 2 points for games using "skirmish" rules (See Mordheim.) HOWEVER, Games Workshop is unparalleled in their support of their miniatures products. Lavish packaging, lurid photography, reams of backstories, galleries of fan art, and mind-boggling awesome painted minis and terrain of the finished products are all siren calls of the Games Workshop "Hobby." The "fluff" that GW creates for this game consumes all four points I've given to it! Abandon All Hope, Ye Who Enter Here.

RATING: 8
Not for the faint of heart.  These games are the most demanding type of game in the world.  The tomes to read, figures to buy, the assembling and painting of models, building terrain, understanding the rules and building an army on paper, and finding someone who has done all of this too to play.  The game is all war, but many people join the community just for the hobby aspect of building, painting, and army building.  

I have played this game since 1998 and have been on a sabbatical for the last two.  My largest complaint is trying to find someone as serious about the game who isn't a social outcast.

At one point I was offered a job with the company and I almost went down that road.  I only mention that because I have spent thousands of hours and dollars with this game and still like it.  I had a White Dwarf subscription for years and years and have owned every game (except lotr) that games workshop has ever made.  

I say previously owned because I have bought and sold thousands of dollars of armies over the years.  Yes I said thousands of dollars, but I have painted them and made money.

Great game, but it really takes dedication to do it well and stay on top of the ever changing rules and miniatures.  They do a complete revamp of the rules every five years (or so), making the old minis sometimes obsolete.

If you have been itching to get into a miniature war game and don't have the stomach for all the overhead and learning, try Arcane Legions or Battleground: Fantasy Warfare.

Warhammer is probably the most popular miniatures game out there. The newest edition (6th) is a good ruleset, with a fair amount of consistency and a good power level.

WFB is very much a dice pool game, where players often roll entire handfuls of d6 at a time. The mechanics are simple to learn, though there are lots of exceptions and special rules.

Games Workshop produces (mostly) very good quality miniatures, though they are by no means cheap. WFB requires a heavy commitment, both in time and money. If you can afford to invest both of those things, I recommend WFB, in part because this is a game you're likely to find players for relatively easy.

More a lifestyle than a game - if you get into this you'll sink a huge amount of time (painting) and money (buying figures). Quite liked the original game - we used cardboard figures, later rule sets, fine if you like that sort of game.

I'd probably play if you provided the figures.

Original white box version (which I owned) I'd rate a 4, maybe a bit more for nostalgia - wasn't very balanced and not at all realistic.

8th ed takes Warhammer to a whole new level of awesomeness! 
There are a few "flaws" present, but they are easy to fix: 
First off, since you only get points for units that are completely obliterated, there can be battles where there's just a ton of casualties yet hardly any VPs scored.
Second: Since forests basically no longer block line of site, the battlefields are much more open (too open). It might be worth going back to the old rules for forests (at least for purposes of blocking line of site).

This game can be an expensive life-style both in cost and time.  I'm all for GW making money - but I haven't shaken the feeling that some rules were deliberately broken/unbalanced in order to justify yet another edition or yet another series of units (i.e. miniatures) being scrapped to be replaced by something new.  I'm off the bandwagon on this game.

When I owned a game store back in the mid 90's, I actually had a Games Workshop sales rep say to me: "We don't really care if the rules are good or not. We're in the business of selling metal, not games. We redo armies every few years so that both we and you can make more money selling updated figs."

The game isn't much better than this bloke's morals.

i still have fond memories of this game even if GW has butchered things with their business practices and the Age of Sigmar remake.  wf appeals to me far more than w40k which might be related to the theme and my preference for medieval style warfare.  i still enjoy collecting and painting wf though i don't get to play it anymore these days.

I own the 5, 6 and 7th editions of this game. It's one of my all time favorite fantasy settings and the grandaddy of all the mini games I love to play. It gets major props for richness of setting and for the different flavor of tactics that comes from maneuvering blocks of ranked troops, calvary, and warmachines. I personally prefer 40k and WARMACHINE, and yet I'll probably always consider WFB my "primary" wargame.

Highly influential.

Love a good Warhammer game. I've played all Warhammer rules except the last one. Never really knew any though. 
Most games are too competitive for me though. Ho, and leave me alone with the optimization neverending mind game. I'm a wargamer, and I don't often see the link between warhammer and wargaming. I'm not a great player, but I have instinct in wargames. Following this instinct in Warhammer would drive me into quick defeat. This game has clearly got out of hand from its masters and lives on his own. 
I thank this game for providing me salary for so long. That was honest, as I was such a fan when teenager. And don't tell about the RPG, I am ashamed of no Warhammer game master. Bring it on dear, I had my own one, unlike any others.

Digressing there. Anyway, thank you Warhammer and my dear teenage customers listen to this : anybody taking this mind games seriously is wrong. Laugh at him.

I used to play this long ago (like 1989 or so) and had a great time doing it.  One problem my friends and I always had was "painting awe" from looking at issues of White Dwarf and wanting to create armies that looked like that.  We also had way too grand of notions as to the types and scale of armies we could field.  I really like the old rulebook I have (and the old Realm of Chaos books)... and would like to try those rules again using my newer collection of D&D miniatures.

A fantasy wargame from Games Workshop. No where near as good a system or in-game universe as Warhammer 40K, but it's fun.

Unlike 40K, WFB has a fairly terrible over-complex system which could do with toning down. The current 8th edition is a good start on that path.

Just as with 40K, the initial setup is going to cost you the value of a small nation but once you're into the game you can just save up and pick bits up as you go along.

Used to play this religiously mainly due to my friends getting into it, had two fully painted armies: Chaos (Primarily Demons of Nurgle & Slaanesh) as well as a huge Undead mass. The game rules are meticulous to the point of insanity though, and the continuous cost of this one is on par with Magic with an equal time investment involved because of the need to actually prepare the minis for play.

I enjoyed my time with the game, but the cost just doesn't justify the time and monetary investment. I honestly feel that the game behind all the pretty terrain and minis isn't altogether special. Scratch that, the game itself is unspectacular in the extreme. A lot of specialized rules for each army that you want to know about so you can play appropriately, typical mini LOS issues, and broken magic items aplenty which always cause arguments and house rules.

As an experience, I'll remember my WHFB time with some fondness but the game itself is nothing particularly innovative, and would never sell if the components were generic and packaged inside a standard board game box.

When I was done with this game I sold my armies and paid for most of a week long trip to Europe...so if you paint the minis up nicely and keep them for a few years you can look at them as an investment...or perhaps now you'll be getting a better picture of the money pit aspect :laugh:

RATING: 5
I give it a 8-9 for background material, but the game is very, very poor. I'll give 2 to the game, GW spoiled the game from every sublety concentrating its interest in selling expensive minis. It's merit nowadays lies in getting fresh blood to the hobby of wargaming.

RATING: 7
An expensive but eye-candy [u]table-top[/u] wargame regarding maneuvering a high number of miniatures and fighting with tons of dice to throw (high luck factor). Very cinematic! Miniatures must be assembled and painted. They are very useful to play other wargames too!
I own these books:
- Sixth Edition (Italian book).
- Seventh Edition (English book) from the [i]Battle for the Skull Pass[/i] set.
- Eighth edition (English book) from the [i]Island of Blood[/i] set providing the best rules up to date.
The 7th is more tactical and better for small armies, 8th is more fun and random with a lot of things depending on luck or choices. I think the 8th edition rules encourage buying more and more models but I don't have enough space to run over 1000p armies. So, I prefer playing a mixture from both editions, let's say a v7.5. Generally I use all v7 rules except: I eliminate guessing distances; charges must move straight forward with one free turning; first two ranks of a unit may now fire and CC; bows may volley fire; other minor rules.
Also, I own 4 armies:
- Orcs and Goblins - 2500p;
- High Elves - 1000p;
- Skaven - 800p;
- Dwarfs - 650p.

RATING: 9.5
Having been playing the game for almost 10 years, it has grown and become one of the most popular fantasy tabletop gaming systems in the world today.

its rules and gameplay are laden with action and interactivity of the highest level.

Furthermore, its miniatures and army books are a vital enhancement to making the game stand out from other tabletop games. However, the downside of Warhammer is that it is a very very expensive hobby and prices for miniatures and paints can be really an eyesore for someone who does not have adequate affluence and passion to take it on

But With the high grade miniatures and a large assortment of armies to play, this game will remain a strong force in the tabletop gaming world and draw many enthusiast to admire the workmanship of players/modellers on their miniatures and the dynamics of the game

Uggg, this game just will not die. GW has milked this teat so hard it has to be coughing out sand by now. Constantly changing rules and setting tournament rules requiring you to change out your minis every year or two at outlandish costs. A shameless marketing machine. Even when I was playing it, I was frustrated with the rules loops, juvenile themes, the players it attracts, and the money pit factor, and frequently silly designs (E.g. Noise Marines). Its all about the slow ass play, trillion die rolling, and 12 hour excruciatingly slow games.

Two words for you: Chaos Dwarves (~1995). Oh my god, WTF were they thinking. Worst mini's ever. Yet they still cycle some crap.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This is typical of mpst of Games Workshop's table top games, all flash bang and no substance.  It is satisfying to play a game over beautifully constructed scenery and wonderfully painted models, but they cost so much and the rules are so long and over-elaborate that you wonder why you bothered once the whole thing is set up.

Never the less, it is quite satisfying to have to roll 40 dice in one go and pick out the 6's.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Though i'm a little burned out on WHFB it still gets a great rating based on the amount of time i've spent playing this game, IMO The richest most varied fantasy miniatures rules to date, every faction feels and plays completely differently, and reasonably well balanced considering the scope, i haven't yet met the uber army that i couldn't counter within a couple of attempts.  Power creep is a myth put forward by people unable to adapt their tactics.

Less burned out since the new vampire book was released, bring it on!!

Some good changes in 8th edition, but also some very bad ones.

RATING: 7
This is a great modeling hobby.  Few activities are quite as relaxing as painting models.

In addition, the strategy aspect of this game is very good.  There are countless paths that a player can take in building their army which makes for quite alot of fun.

Now the downside is that building a "usable" army is quite expensive.  It is around $150-$300 to build a normal sized army and that is nothing to sneeze at.

Compared to 40k, fantasy is much more rigid and non-mobile.  Your units are placed before the game begins and typically they march straight forward to crash into the enemy.  But in 40k the units turn, rotate, retreat, and generally stay agile.  A unit can very easily cross the entire map twice in 40k, while in fantasy they are lucky to make it to the end of the map once.  

Finally, fantasy is usually cheaper than 40k.

RATING: 7
Can be super fun, and I really enjoyed it as a hobby. Each edition has its own flaws and positives, so your experience can depend quite heavily on which version you're playing. I mostly rolled with the 4th edition, the first "big box" version, and stopped after 5th edition and the rush of new armies was out and about. 

Moving big units around can be difficult (apologies to Randy Johnson), and some armies kind of demanded 25+ model units, so come prepared with movement trays or whatnot. Beginning with 4th ed each army has a very strong identity, with distinct troop types, magic systems, and special characters. Some armies are have a diverse array of elite troops to choose from, some have no cavalry and are limited in terms of mobility, some have great war machines to supplement their weaker troop-types, while some have next to no range attacks but are beasts in melee, etc. 

The Warhammer world is also quite well defined. Some of it is generic fantasy, but the mix of borrowed elements adds up well. It lost some of its off-beat humor in the pursuit of grim-dark over the years, but such is the way of these games. 

There is a lot of dice rolling. A lot. That actually helps mitigate the luck-element of it all, but it can take up a lot of time and be difficult to keep track of. Overall Warhammer is a lot of a lot of stuff, and sometimes difficult to keep track of or be accurate about.

While I have watched many battles of this interesting game, I have only actually played it 4 times. The first time was with a Dwarven army (not my own), with which I literally eliminated a solid enemy force!!!  It is the only game I ever remember, in which the roll of dice was so tremendously favorable for me, while being hugely unfavorable for my opponent at the same time. I am talking about 90% + favor. I kept winning the rolls and he kept loosing them, to the point of almost complete elimination of his entire force - except for the Dragon... which chickened out before making contact with my regiments... I don't know whether that was appropriate and abiding to the rules but, on the other hand, I had made it clear that my Dwarves were going to have dragon shish-kabob that evening. So, by retreating willingly the poor miserable guy won a minor victory in not having his Dragon skewered!! :-)  I am not much of a miniature player, I do always like and favor Dwarves however!

Probably anyone who's ever been to a convention has seen a game of Warhammer going on.  This unforunately is exaclty the idea.  Warhammer, is a game of 98% flash and 2% substance.  The miniatures are top notch, rivaled by only a few companies in the business.  The rules, however, are geared towards miniatures that have a lifespan of a few years (when the next rulebook makes them "outdated" or the army they belong to gets phased out only to be reintroduced later with "new and improved" miniatures.  The good news is that you'll always be able to find someone to play since it seems to be the only universally played game at most hobby shops which is sad since the hobby really deserves better.

Well, the miniatures are AMAZING (some of the best in the market right now, if not the best) but the rules are terrible. The system is extremly boring and simple

You can say "it has a loooot of rules" yes, but all those rules are just numbers and nothing else (+X to Y skill)

They have not changed the core rule system since it was born (1983) so... what are we expecting for?

The miniatures are great, the rules are all patched up (GW trademark, right?). My Tomb Kings Army is ready to take it to the field but in the current mood with the correct adversary (I'm talking here on the fact that almost all GW players are guys that dont know how to enjoy the game, by the game, and for the game in itself, the great driving motivation is WIN WIN WIN, against this mindset I rarelly enjoy gaming)

I used to absolutely adore warhammer back when I was a kid (4th-5th editions), but the constantly skyrocketing miniature and armies books prices, the everchanging rules, and the delayed army releases really took their toll on my enjoyment of the game. It seemed to me that every time they released a new army, it was better than the last. Then when you finally got used to the current system, they would revise it/release a new rule book etc. Frustrating!

Building & painting the models is great fun.  There are so many armies, each with their own book (not a recipe card, a BOOK) of special rules, so no game is even close to the same as another.  The sheer volume of rules can be daunting at first, but it's worth sticking to it to learn.

Fantasy Battles has always held a soft spot for me.  The idea of huge fantasy armies represented by hordes of little dudes is just so epic and cool.  The rules system is really in need of some streamlining, but at least I feel like I can get most rules questions answered if I dig far enough, unlike 40k.  The overpriced models also prevent this from getting a higher score.

Lots of fun when I was a kid.  But, with only two opponents, and no opportunites to go to cons/gaming events, it wore out it's welcome with me.  As a consuming game (consuming all your time, money, and other games), it's not awful, but you could do better by playing the 40K version.  Some super fun battles and situations cannot make up for the constant rules changes and confusing and often unbalanced hodge-podge of armies.

I spent many years and lots of hard earned cash playing this when I was younger. If I had the time and money now I may well be tempted to play it once again. I'm sure there are probably better games in the same ilk out there but I'm a fantasy fan so this appeals more than most other wargames. Plus the hobby aspect of painting miniatures and building scenery is quite enjoyable too. Sadly these days the new version is aimed at younger kids and Games Workshop is all about making massive profits rather than being more of a 'club' where people can come and enjoy the hobby in a pressure-free environment.

Rating is based upon last several editions.  I have NOT played the current edition.  All notes below about the company are still accuate.

I have played fantasy minis for over 35 years.  This is a fine set of fantasy miniature gaming rules AND it is played by multitudes of more people than any other fantasy rule set on the planet.  If you want to play fantasy minis with other humans chances are you will need to play with with these rules.

BUT, the company is a shark.  Buy their rules to play.  Buy their figures if you are rich or have too (i.e. you want to play in their company sponsored tournements).  Just shop around.  eBay is your friend and other figure manufactures 'do' make better figures at much lower $ than GW.  Rating downgraded two full points because of high cost and company's "marketing strategies" which include releasing book after book that get more powerful as they progress...it helps to sell the newest figures/books...oh and lets not forget the monthly rules updates that are released in their overpriced magazine or their trade practices that were found to be illegal in the United States after they were successfully used to put dozens of game stores out of business in the UK.

RATING: 3
As a game it's mechanics are moderately good, they can certainly be improved through good house rules but the problem with those is they are useless when you leave the house.

As a hobby however I have always found myself enjoying collecting and painting my army. Applying actual warfare tactics to battles seems to work. Though it works better and with more logic to it when used with the house rules I mentioned above.

I decided to update my ratings for this game since it is only right and proper to rate it by the latest available edition, not that other editions were perfect but I have worked on a rules set which fixed the problems of before instead of turning the game on its head. 

I feel 6th edition was worthy of a 5.5
7th was about 6
8th is about 3 at best
My brother and I did write a rules set which was pretty much 7.1 (so 7th with the problems of 7th fixed, much of our inspiration tallied with rules which were brough in under 8th, we just approached them in a more balanced way) - I would have given that about an 8 honestly

The problem with 8th is that there are 4 key phases to each turn; movement, magic, shooting and combat

Movement - used to be the most important phase of the game - due to march blocking, the importance of flank charges, scouts, fast cav... All of these things have been removed; fliers work differently so giving an eagle mounted character a bow means he can't fly 20 inches and shoot as before.

Magic - this has gone crazy. The new 'big spells' are too big and nobody plans a list that doesn't include a level 4 because of this. Dice generation has changed and is supposed to be more balanced than before, the dice cap is a good thing but the winds of magic and shared pool both suck.

Shooting - war machines are now more brittle. Instead of randomising hits as before they now all go on the machine but they've also made it so that strength 3 shooting even has a chance at damaging a toughness 7 machine :( to compensate they have made war machines more powerful by removing more skill elements. Gone are all guess range rules and tlos means they pretty much always hit. Another reason to take l4 over a killy character on some big monster.

Combat - asf has stopped being a defensive means to stop the enemy from attacking you, by killing them first. It is now just there to boost damage output. Step up means dead people fight back. Supporting attacks all just add to the melay and mean that units like spears which before were unique in the fact that they could fight through see now not unique. Then steadfast means that anyone has access to the stubborn rules; this was a good thing to bring in because 7th ed cav ruled the game and were too good, but steadfast went too far and wasn't given the correct caveats.

List design has also seen more changes to a new percentage system which really sucks and I cannot understand the reasoning behind it.

Finally games workshops attitude which hasn't changed and probably never will. Which is to make money at all costs. They would rather make a shit game but manipulate rules to force people to purchase more models... It makes me sad :( what's more is citadel say they are a "model company not a games company", 8th ed has a rule which encourages house rules and 7th has a rule which does the same. Yet when you try this you find few people to play against and such actions are always banned in gw shops.

Like the background, like the look of the minis, would never buy them.  Not only are they overpriced, but the game revolve around getting new minis to follow the ever-releasing codices and unbeatable heroes worth more than entire regiments of basic troops.  Add an alternating turn sequence where being the first to inflict damage is critical as it is applied before return fire, and you have a look good-play bad game.
With the painting and all, this can be seen as a hobby for some, but I'm definitely not the target for it.
Battleground Fantasy Warfare scratch the same itches, with all the things I don't like taken away.

This is a great game, but it is a table top game and therefore NOT for everyone. As a tabletop game the rules are good/ fair and work very well with the pieces. The game is supported locally IF you have a Games workshop store locally- but there is a big shortage of those stores so in practice it is NOT supported locally. The miniatures themselves are usually awesome, but that is based on personal tastes. My  kids are able to understand and play this game (ages 10 and 11) and even if your not a huge war gamer the models are still fun to collect and paint. I personally love the fact that you can customize your army to suit your own personal style and wishes. I can not give this a "10" only because it is expensive and Gamesworkshop seems to make this hobby harder and harder to get into... The rule books and pieces have really gotten to be expensive and you must keep up if you plan to compete or play with strangers at the store. It is definitely over priced.

If Mordheim is the best GW game this has to be the second best. Rules arent easy to learn but with time and help from your local gaming stores and/or friends you will learn. I really recommend this game to all who likes to paint and play with huge armies!

Personally ive been playing GW miniature games 15 years at least. Rules have changed hundreds of times but IMO for better mostly. Lets just hope that mayby one day GW has to lower some prizes...its getting way too expensive already.

Collecting and paiting miniatures is great fun, and when you come together to 'play' a game its probably just for an excuse to come together and talk about what you've been up to in the 'world of miniaturing'.... but pure from a 'greatness-of-the-game'perspective this is 100% useless crap....

Nothing really happens, you just measure and roll dice while all games i ever played is just 2 forces that crash into one another and tactical play isnt really making any difference... also completely unballanced and overpowered units.... i remember some guy convinced me to play a game some years ago, and i fell for it... we both brought 1500 point,... i brought orc and goblin, he brought darkelves... what i m about to say is true: He killed my entire army without losing 1 single point of his own....................   all ranged stuff was so ridiculous overpowered that it just doesnt make sense. worthless game....  great hobby

Sucked in, payed $$$$$$$$$ for the stuff then sold or gave away all WHFB stuff.

Warhammer is not exactly the boardgame, it's a kind of hobby by itself. It includes collecting, assembling, painting and playing the actual game is just a small part of it.

I was collecting and painting my dark elves army from my late school years to first grades in university and still played it only few times.

I think as a boardgame it's not the best (my rating reflects it). It requires a lot of time to play and includes much dice rolling. The armies also seemed a little imbalanced to me (some are much better against others).

But still it is a very nice hobby and I don't regret the time I devoted to it.

Interesting tabletop warfare game.
Excellent setting, lots of awesome lore and excellent models. Just oozes character.

Sadly enough a very expensive hobby, no longer supported by the company and really requires too much time. More a "lifestyle" game than a hobby game.

fun game when played with nicely painted and sculpted armies and with opponent who wants fun and not to discuss and cheat rules.

Although lack of good opponents and high costs (money, time and space) finally forced me to sell my collection. Still I have some fond memories of it.

Enough rules(close combat for example)are the same as Warhammer 40k that it makes it easy to learn one if you know the other.   There are enough differences that it feels like a very different game though. 

It also feels like larger armies would be more fun, which means acquiring a lot of miniatures.

I spent huge amounts of money on this as a teenager (as did most teenage boys in the UK, I suspect), and it's only looking back on it that I realise I didn't really enjoy it all that much. I mean, I did a lot of army-building and liked that part, but the actual game? It ended up being most of a day spent just running your armies at each other.

Loving this game! Not actually a board game but a tabletop.
I play Warhammer since 6th Edition and have a lot of fun playing it! In my opinion one of the best fantasy tabletop games out there. Of course it do have flaws and it isn't really balanced... two points which would highly count against a high rating, but it IS one of my absolute favourite games (if not the MOST favourite) and therefore I rated this a 10.
I do have a Greenskin, Chaos and a Vampire Army and I am always willing to play a game!
At the moment I raise a Skaven army as well...

RATING: 5
For the game system itself, I would even give a 3.
But without WFB, the fantasy range of Citadel miniature would have remain very poor. Moreover all the background of the "Old World" is like a compilation of:
- Tolkien for Dummies (Elfs, Orcs, Goblins)
- Moorcock for Dummies (Chaos)
- Arthurian Myths for Dummies (Bretonny)
- History of the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation for Dummies (Empire)
So because of this (twisted) cultural work that merit 7/10, this made (3+7)/2=5

I've only playe dit a few times, and while I will admit it was a nice change from what I usually play, I really hate the system, and the idea that I am going to spend a ton of time painting a formation of troops that are going to sit in a block most of the game and be limited on their movement. The models for Warhammer are awesome, but the games are basically: move all the units to the center and start rolling a million dice. Bought sixth edition once but sold it soon after.

When I was 11 years old, I transcended from HeroQuest to Warhammer Fantasy. At least that is whar I would like to believe. In reality, the game was so expensive that I had very few friends who owned an army of their own. Also the rules were complex and the game was very time consuming. Painting all of those miniatures was on a whole new level of time consumption. So actually the game saw very little play. Most of my time was spent assembling my armies and painting the miniatures. Warhammer was more of a hobby on its own than a fun game to play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
i love this game, but you must understand it is more than just a game.  it is a hobby in itself.  collecting miniatures, painting them and preparing them for the table, creating terrain for your battlefield, putting together the army list, and then the important tactics that occur during the battle.  it really is a great game.  yes, there are those who say that it is too random because of the dice rolls, but a good player is able to make the odds of the dice in their favor.  and it also relies on good tactics and employing concepts like maneuverability, using shooting to your advantage, picking which battles to occur.  overall, just an awesome game...er i mean a hobby.  highly recommended, but be warned that it is quite expensive because you will find yourself getting wrapped into it and investing several hundred dollars for a good army
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Several plays.  I think I like Fantasy Battle a bit better than it's cousin, Warhammer 40K.  And, when I was playing in the mid 90's, I loved it.  But it is much more expensive to get into now than it was then, and it's just not worth the cost.  A new player would be much better served buying several cheaper board games.  Probably the biggest drawback for me is, I have never enjoyed a game.  You really need the right players for this game to be fun.

A fantastic (ha) war game.  A lot of strategy (building army lists and preparing for others).  Plenty of tactics to balance out the randomness of the dice rolls.  Moved pretty far away from the "herohammer" days of yore.  The world is also constantly evolving with story lines and even new races to spice things up.  By far Games Workshop's best game.

Beyond early Risk, this was probably my first real "hobby" boardgame. Played extensively with my High Elves army in my school days, but since moving to Uni haven't played at all. Probably won't be played again, since my core gaming group has dispursed all over the globe, and quite frankly couldn't be bothered to drop the required cash to get the latest iteration rules and updated armies books etc. But still, fond memories :)

Updated rating for 8th edition (after 10 plays).  GW has knocked this version out of the park!  If you ever thought of playing but haven't since 6th (or even before) this is the edition to check out. Other editions I would put at 7-8 rating.

RATING: 7.5
This game isn't perfect.  In this rating I'm including the enjoyment I get from the hobby of the game - painting models, creating terrain, etc.

That said, I think it's a fine miniatures game.  The detail on terrain is not that found in Heroscape (at least not with the terrain we've so far created for Warhammer).  The miniatures are excellent, rules are serviceable, and we like to consume adult beverages during play.  

I will also say I came into this in 7th edition.  Will I buy the 8th edition big book?  Probably.  Will I buy a 9th?  Not able to say.

I have a number of large armies and am nearly always willing to play. But the price just drops the rating. Even though it's 'more' then a game. It's more a hobby in itself, painting up your miniatures, building terrain and killing other troops. And what is better then to say: "HA, my goblin killed your Dragon" when your precious and expensive dragon is not supported, flees and is overrun.

Complex, fun. Painting your miniatures is half the game :) After all the revisions, it is a very solid game with no ambiguous rules. Games can vary a lot in length due to the size of the armies you will decide t play with. However, even with very small numbers of armies, games can last for a solid hour. Truly a masterpiece.

I have a 4000 point Orc & Goblin army.  8th Edition is what 40K needs to be.  40K is just getting stupid with all the armor saves in the game.  This is a much more fun game with the armor save adjustments from strength and the new rules and nerf to the cavalry charge make the game playable again.

A horrible excuse for a game to con people into spending thousands on overpriced miniatures. Slimy business practice of making older units obsolete every few years is despicable. Negligible reward for skilled tactical play. Outcomes are predetermined by "metagaming" - building armies beforehand which is inexorably tied to your cash outlay. The final straw and my reason for lowering rating to "1" after careful consideration was their removal of all fan created content on BGG.

Great minis but flawed rules. Could easily be made more realistic and playable without added complexity by revising the rules. For some strange reason I nevertheless have three complete armies; Bretonnia (5000 pts), Wood Elves (2000 pts) and Night Goblins (2000 pts).

The latest edition (8th) corrects some rules flaws, but could have gone even further.

Ok - I now own every edition of the game.  Yup 1st (white box), 2nd (orange bookcase),  3rd ed (hardcover), 4th ed (boxed), and 5th ed (boxed), 6th softcover and 7th (battle for skull pass) and now 8th edition hardcover.  It has been somewhat frustrating to see the points values of models getting smaller and smaller.  This means you need to buy more stuff to make a minimum army.  After AD&D and M:TG this game has consumed more of my time than any other.  I have models for every army with my largest armies bing Orcs/Goblins, High Elves and Chaos.  I have almost every army book from each edition and most of the alternative supplements as well.

Wow - the money I have dumped into GW.  Insane. No totally insane. 

One last thing... as of Jan/06 I counted my miniatures.  I have 1500++ models and at least 1/2 are pewter/lead.  Now if I could only paint them all... I get frustrated looking at WD quality vs. my own.  I love making terrain and hope to spend lots of quality time with my son doing that.

Many people dislike GW's policies especially when they make models obsolete in new editions.  Just make your own rules and have fun.  That is what Warhammer is truly about.  

I better get back to ummm... painting.

Loved it as a kid, a wonderful medieval ruleset with crazy powers and a lot of maneuvering. Classic tons of dice to roll with 5+, then a saving throw, and remove what's left. The game has a meaning if the models are painted and the battle is played over a diorama; or else the pleasure is more than halved.

I give up 40K for this game and I definitely recommend this game to anyone who's willing to shell out (easily) $500-$1k. This game is win and loss on the movement, dice rolling is just a statistic aspect to the mechanic which most player can just do the math in their head before committing to a fight. If you are interested in the game, you could easily find a PDF version of the rulebook, read it.. find a couple chip or chits to "proxy" a game against a friend.

Great tabletop war gaming experience. It is the ultimate strategic war game, but its not for me any more. Takes an incredible amount of commitment on many levels: financial commitment to buy miniatures, time to assemble miniatures, paint them, design a competitive army and then the actual game can be a whole afternoon for one battle. Deserves merit but is for very patient people and realistically is a lifestyle game.

Although 'serious' miniatures gamers like this game much more then 40k, 'serious' miniatures gamers should be playing historical games, or at least games much more serious than silly GW games.
40k is much more fluid and fun, and the people who play Fantasy Battles I have found to be much more nit-picky and stiff-necked than most of the 40k players I have encountered.
I'll take 40k over Fantasy any day.

Used to play a lot, but then my then gaming group broke up.

The basic system is fiddlier than I like these days, but it works. The magic system used to be dire but in 6e it was improved to merely poor. Monsters, heroes and magicians tend to inflict most casualties, but grunts are needed to provide sufficient momentum to break the enemy. Contrarily to what some will tell you, I never found power creep to be an issue (but then I was never a tournament player).

Having found this and a lot of mini's at a garage sale for next to nothing I can luckily look at this game without regard for cost, of which I must say it's a pretty good time. While not terribly strategic it does have a nice epic feel to the action on the table and looks impressive all set up. 

To factor in the cost of this stuff at retail though I really couldn't recommend getting into it at all. The price to build a decent army or two is ridiculous, even by a questionably frivolous hobby like gaming's standards. Plus the constant ebb and flow of min/maxing that runs rampant in this game system with each new publication just means you'll be broke and burnt out after a few editions. It makes competitive Magic play look like an affordable alternative.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
The games are long, but they look good with everything painted and all that scenery. It's a shame the mechanics aren't better. Nearly all of the decisions are made before the game begins (army composition and deployment), the execution comes down to dice rolling, like running an experiement.

Serious design problems around game balance, vague rules, excessive randomness, lack of meaningful decisions and dominant strategies, not to mention the cost.

The entry point to miniature gaming. I used to play this a lot, I was a real GW-junkie. Now that I've grown up and I realize that this stuff is made up and bogus and gets changed every 5 years, I switched to historicals.

To quote freely:
"When you're 15, and you don't love WARHAMMER, there's something wrong with you. When you're 30, and you still do love WARHAMMER, there's definitely something wrong with you."

A pretty good game but tends to get a little unbalanced as new army books are introduced. 5th Ed was know as "Herohammer" cos one can pump his hero into a one man army. 6th ed corrected that issue.

GW's WH twins are something so essential in miniature wargaming world that they cannot be ignored.

I'm sure that they aren't the most logical games and the prices are just way too expensive nowadays... However, WH is so common that the lack of opponents won't be an issue - even in the smallest town.
I collected these miniatures a lot in past days and now got into them again. The world of Warhammer has had so many years to evolve and develop that it has become very great place. All the stories that world has to tell made me come back to the game after all these years.
Another reason was that painting the miniatures can be really relaxing. In the rush of these days, sometimes there is nothing as relaxing as to grab a brush and start painting.

Gameplay has it's flaws of course, but in my opinion, it's a fun dicefest. Tactics and strategical play cannot be underrated in these series ever. The idea is to maximize the odds, rest is luck. Luck is essential in battles, since anything can happen! The same is seen in ASL too and I have nothing to complain of the rules of Warhammer FB (I've read the 7th edition).

Almost all the miniature games has the common thing that they won't work if two players play only to win and won't think it all as an experience and a hobby. But when played as a mutual way of having fun, really fantastic stories can be told!

Uno de los mejores juegos de la historia de simulación con figuras, aunque los de la Games Workshop sean unos cabrones sacacuartos (¿y quién no?). Ya sabemos que cada x años toca revisión de reglas. Por otro lado, si no fuera así no llevaría todos los años que lleva dando el follón (25 añicos ná más), táctica que van aplicando otras empresas con más o menos acierto. Esto unido a su revista-catálogo White Dwarf y a los innumerables torneos que se llevan a cabo en todo el mundo nos asegura la permanencia del juego por muchos añicos más.

I've been playing this borrowing armies from a group that have a decent collection while getting introduced in small campaigns and simplified rules to start.  After three plays I am enjoying this game.  I don't think that I'll be investing in it.  I think it would also be huge fun with the assembly and painting of the minis.  I want to try more "war games" and I don't think this is a great place to start due to the bang-fo-the-buck factor that I also crave - no Warhammer investment means an investment in a handful of other games.  However, it is fun.

8th edition rocks!

11/29/2009 - Got in a few more games. One of the most frustrating game systems I've ever had to learn. I think I am still enjoying it quite a bit, though. I have a majority of my army painted now.

3/17/2010 - Went through a period of not being happy with my VC. I have started a lizardmen army now, but have not played it yet. I am really enjoying fantasy again.

9/26/2010 - Lizardmen are great, but I wanted to mix it up with some more fun in the new 8th edition so I now have an Orcs and Goblins army. I love 8th edition and had a blast playing in my first fantasy GT (Tides of War). Really liking the game a lot right now.

3/4/2011 - I have not really been feeling like playing Fantasy for the past few months. I sold off the Lizardmen and may also sell my VC. Just not that great of a game to me at the moment.

5/23/2011 - Sold my last army, not likely to ever play this one again.

Most of the fun rests in digging in to the races and learning their strengths and weaknesses.  Battles tend to be more fun when characters are utilized to support fighting forces rather than as the pre-eminent pieces in the army.  The necessity of having an open ended battle strategy and the on-the-spot improvisation increases the over all game enjoyment.  Infinite possibilities for game play exist as terrain elements and opponent composition from game to game are potentially always in flux.

But the game itself is enjoyed by thousands of people the world over and has some of the best support you can find in any tabletop collectors type game.

The granddaddy of all hobby games. I haven't played this in ages but I have painted hundreds of figures for the game and fielded armies for Wood Elves, High Elves and the Skaven. It has a lot of rules and a lot of dice rolling but with painted figures and good looking table it's very enjoyable. The space needed to store the figures and play area, painting, building of armies and checking the rules during the game all take a bit too much time nowadays for me to to play it any more. Hopefully some day again...

More the game of "fantasy skirmishes" than "fantasy battles," this always felt like it was at the wrong scale to convey the feeling it was meant to convey. A traditional miniature gamer might solve this by saying each piece represents ten soldiers, but that doesn't appeal either (why play with miniatures if you're going to do that?).

Even with armies being smaller than I'd imagine for fantasy warfare, WFB required a painful investment up front to have a useable force. Given GW's subsequent track record of repeatedly changing army lists, it's amazing that people still keep up with the latest rules.

Vous pouvez prendre mon avis avec toutes les pincettes que vous avez à votre disposition, étant donné que je n'ai pas beaucoup joué à Warhammer (une demi-douzaine de parties il y a quelques années), et jamais avec mes propres figurines, ayant quand même réussi à échapper au gouffre financier et temporel (?) que représente ce jeu (bien que je sois effectivement tombé dans [gameid=463] et [gameid=1270], à l'époque...)

Un des premiers jeux m'ayant fait renier les figurines, et même après avoir essayé [gameid=7742], pourtant manifestement encensé par les amateurs, mon avis n'a pas changé. Une partie dure des heures, pendant lesquelles on passe son temps à attendre son tour ou à lancer des dés, sans que rien de vraiment palpitant ne semble se dérouler sous nos yeux, sinon de jolis dioramas autour desquels le temps semble s'être arrêté. Comme à Magic, tout le « jeu » semble être dans la construction de son armée (et l'apprentissage du livre de règles — on ne peut ici parler de livret ni de manuel !) et son placement initial. Ensuite, ce sont les dés qui font la différence, mais pendant des heures, là où une partie de [gameid=463] dure dix minutes. Le jeu est statique au possible, et cette impression est renforcée la quantité de règles et l'imprécision des notions de ligne de vue ou de déplacement (au double décimètre, au millimètre près !), surtout avec des décors compliqués en 3D, qui peuvent entrainer des heures de palabres inutiles...

Bref, un passe-temps plus qu'un jeu. On ne m'y prendra sans doute plus.

I had previously rated this a 7.5, but in protest of GW's recent cease and desist letter to BGG, I am un-rating the game.  I was in the midst of painting my minis, and have suddenly lost all appetite to play the game, or any other official GW game.  Off to play their also-banned, fan-maintained, NetEpic.  If GW doesn't want to support their fans, I see no reason for BGG users to give them free advertising and product support.

See my comments on 40k and apply everything I said there to this. It's a load of fun when you have the time and money to invest but I just don't find myself caring about this at all any more. I would rather just buy another army for Battleground and play that than buy a single unit of anything in Warhammer these days... And now that they keep coming out with new editions to the rules everything I own is out of date...so I doubt I'll be playing this again any time soon.

As everything that comes from Games Workshop, the older versions are better.  There is not much acutual content in the game books.  I have found the self-advertising to be rather ugly.  Not being a painter, I feel that I miss out on a lot of the experience.  As far as rules go, this game has little depth to it.

The components are damn expensive and the game is unbalanced. The rules are among the worst I've ever seen and I need to remember hundreds of little details to be able to play.

Warhammer Fantasy Dark Elf lot. These figures were the core of my dark elf army that I never completed. There is over 450.00 US dollars worth of miniatures here and this will give you an excellent army set up for the game. I have the old dark elf book but you will probably want to get the new one. I checked on the GW website and all these units are still legal. The only ones that are different are the cold ones as I have the previous versions. What I have listed is what I saw glancing through my box. There are extras that I will throw in. If you want to play Warhammer, this is an excellent started set.

Witch King on Black Dragon box set unassembled
Dark Elf Beastmaster on Manticore in shrink
Dark Elf Witch elves unit x2 in shrink and partially assembled
Dark Elf Warriors Regiment x2 unassembled.
Dark Elf Corsairs, x1 unit partially assemebled.
Dark Elf Cold ones x1 unit partially assembled
Dark Elf Shades x1 unit partially assembled
Dark Elf repeating bolt thrower x2, on in blister, one partially assembled
Sahdowblade assassin x1
2x dark elf black guard blisters
dark elf cauldron of blood partially assembled
Dark Riders 1 unit partly assembled
Dark Elf Cold one Chariot partly assembled
Dark elf War Hydra partly assembled.

I ship for free in the US and you pay shipping to Canada or other countries.

That's a lifestyle, not a game. The amount of time it takes to prepare your models is really massive, and then the gaming starts. That's one of the best strategy board games I have ever played, with very complex rules and a really nice appearance, if the models have been painted well. I own an army of Wood Elves, which has been waiting for their paint for almost a year now - not that much time. 
A game for real geeks.

Have a lot of miniatures but don't really like the game.  Takes too long to play, and is too expensive with the scores of miniatures to a side needed.  Tends to be fairly easy to develop tactics once you know the armies.  Run up the middle, split the table, crush anything in sight.  Sigh.  Oh yeah, and don't roll a 1!  Painting the figures and making the terrain is the best part.

RATING: 7
Fun, unit level miniatures game.  The minis are great but are quite overpriced right now--there are much better competing minatures out there.  Although a bit of a dice-fest and prone to luck swings, nevertheless the strategy-element is much stronger than in 40k.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The game has more or less satyed the same over the years, but the company has just kept up advanes in their modelling, and molding techniques.  Collecting and painting a WFB army is very rewarding in a way like few other games out there.  

So-so game with great event support, ease of finding opponents, and tons of stuff to do on your downtime.

I play orcs and goblins.

RATING: 4
I have a strange love-hate relationship with this game. I love the background world and figures, but the rules are under-whelming and in some places downright silly--for example character challenges. The biggest problem is the flavor of the month power creep that is created each time a new Army book is released so GW can sell more product. I can't see myself going to a convention and playing this competitively unless I shell out hundreds of dollars on the "newest thing." Having said that if you are lucky to have several gaming friends or live in an area with an active community, you can usually find good opponents who enjoy playing and not just winnning.The miniatures are over-priced, but deals on used armies are easy to find online. I feel sorry for anyone who goes out and buys figures at full-price. I don't like the GW corporate culture and high-pressure sales tactics I have encountered in some of the GW stores. Much like Magic the Gathering it is a good game ruined by the company that produces it. I also would like to see more variety in Armies--maybe an Asian themed Cathay army, or fleshed out Kislevites and Dogs of War. 
I have had good fun with this over the years with other casual gamers who don't take it seriously. Miniatures games aren't for everyone. Some people don't like to paint figures or make terrain so guess what--you are probably not going to enjoy Warhammer. Now that I have discovered Warmachine and Hordes, I doubt I will ever play this again.

Too expensive. Too long. Needs to much space. And who has the time to paint all those miniatures? 

Add in the complex rules and the numerous exceptions for various troops, and you'll have a complicated but unrealistic warfare simulation which you'll probably seldomly play for time and room restrictions.

This is not just an excellent game, it's an entire hobby: there's army building, collecting, customizing & painting of miniatures, terrain building...

Extremely rewarding, but a royal pain for your wallet.

Edit: I'm strictly talking about 6th through 7th-8th edition. Age of Sigmar is an abomination and has nothing to do with Warhammer Fantasy Battle, which GW cruelly put down like a sick animal despite its many loyal fans. For shame GW.

Great game, definitely worth every afternoon I've spend on it. Three main drawbacks:

1. Playing time (including preparation of your army etc) easily takes a full afternoon and then some. So it basically costs a full day of gaming.
2. Learning curve is steep, lots of exceptions and very CRAP rulebooks. @GamesWorkshop: PLEASE hire a decent rulebook writer. Heck, hire/ask some folks at the geek. There are lots of diehard fans that can write those rules to something understandable and SHORT. This is costing you a lot of potential players, and thus money!!!
3. It costs a BUCKET of money to assemble an army. Tip if you want to start: buy a complete army from someone and only then add what you need. DO NOT buy your army one cohort at the time!!! And look on Ebay.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
3rd Edition is loaded with really cool stuff, and contains all the army lists in one book. Warhammer has the best background fluff of any fantasy wargame and is tremendously colorful (the painted models in the book are quite inspirational), but its game-mechanics are fiddly and sometimes clunky, and luck can often be a more important factor than smart generalship.       
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
I can't really rate this with honesty as I never got to play much, heck I never even managed to get 1 HQ and 2 troops painted up for it properly, still have the rulebook and those starting boxset minis on the shelf though... although these days the minis tend to get drafted into other games.

Druchii player. 7th Edition removed a few tactical options from 6th, which made the game easier to play at the expense of putting in situations that just don't make sense.

GW also went with some really bad FAQ rulings that lead to a grossly unfair advantage for some armies (Druchii included).

A greater tragedy was the removal of extra scenerios from the main rulebook, forcing most games to degenerate to Pitched Battles.

6th Edition was the better version.

The minatures and the world sucked me into this game and kept me playing, well, interested, for a number of years. Even into the next edition for a bit.

This was the better edition though. The art was cool, even if a bit less organised than later editions, but that kind of added to the freer form of the rules.

Shame about the ropey dice roll driven results, but there you go. If you like random dice rolls throwing carefully planned plans out the window then this is your bag baby!

But those miniatures were cool eh?

I have a nice undead army.  My only gripe about the game is that my army lacks much in the way of variety.  Add to this the fact that two new rules sets for my army have been released since that last core rules set, and I find my option are even more limited (not to mention a portion of my army is not useable.)  Otherwise it is a fun game, and the models look fantastic.

I started my Tabletop-Miniature-Carreer with this one. It was ok at the time but I jumped at 40k as soon as we discovered it. For me by far the inferior of the two Warhammer Tabletop-Systems.

I must have got this as a Christmas gift back in the late ’90s. I remember it had a ton of miniatures and the two armies were ‘Bretonians’ and ‘Lizardmen’; two armies that were new at the time. 
However, since I was only about 9, 10, 11 at the time I was not the greatest painter, nor patient, so it did not get many plays. Warhammer can be a complex (and expensive) game for a young kid. 
I gave the game away to my brother-in-law about 4-5 years ago after the box gathered dust in the loft.

My first introduction to miniatures wargaming.  I came from a background of playing some meaty wargames in the past and at first wasn't so sure about the depth of this but there is a surprising amount of strategy in this game along with a few 'gamey' elements.  Still the scale and rules work well for medieval/fantasy battles and it's great fun pushing the toy soldiers around.  Onward Skaven hordes!

Warhammer 8th edition is a nice improvement over the previous editions -- faster, bloodier, and more "fantastic" with the new magic and mysterious terrain rules. It's still going to take a big chunk of time and money to get involved, but it's a wholly unique gaming experience.

Lots of stuff, and almost all of the books.  While I still enjoy the game, I'm just not sure if I'll ever get a chance to play it again; there's no local "Oldhammer" community, and I was never into the hobby, just the game.

RATING: 7
When I was younger, I had an Orcs & Goblins army worth about 4000 points.

This was my first experience with a miniature's war game, so it wasn't a bad gateway game for those who aren't into historical battles. Like most miniature war games, it was a lot of fun because every battle is different and you have a lot of control. 

However, I think they could improve the balance of game- there are situations where a million units of one type are useless against a single unit of another type because they aren't strong enough to damage him. The morale system is also pretty shaky- if you have an army with poor leadership (like the goblins) you'll find your units routed before they get a chance to fight. Ethereal units are also entirely overpowered, being able to hit anything but only able to be hit by magical weapons.

Like many gamers, I have two-thirds of a Warhammer army, one-quarter painted.  Mine is Dark Elves.  Finding an opponent prepared to lug his army to my place is pretty rare.  I think I like this game (the little I have played), but I very rarely play it.

I prefer 'broken' fifth edition Hero-Hammer. I think the armies are more unique from each other than in the more recent editions.

----------------------
Looking for 4th/5th edition era miniatures, particularly OOP special character sculpts and bulks of troops (all armies)

-----------------------

The draw in this, for me, is the 'meta' hobby of terrain making and modeling and all that. As a game, it's good but not great. With all the 'verse that goes with it, it gets double-plus-thumbs-up from me.

I played the 6th and 7th editions religiously from 2000 until this year (2009).

This seemed like a lot of fun at one point in time but, I never had anyone to play with =( and Games workshop would not let you play unless everything was painted.  I still have enough to field a 3500 point High Elf army.  Almost all of the mini's are metal and I have just about every hero ever made along with all the OOP griffons, unicorns, etc... along with tons of extra bits and unopened blisters.  Lots of custom modifications to even the most basic units including a chariot pulled by three unicorns.

Two plays behind. Feels good as long as you don't take it too seriously. We didn't use all the rules and probably misplayed some rules, but it was fun.

It is not necessarily balanced either.

I grew up with WFB and therefore I have a certain nostalgia associated with the game. It is, as many say, much more than a game... In my opinion the best edition, strategy game-wise, was the third edition of the game. It was also a fairly lengthy game to play. Sixth edition comes close to recapturing the strengths of the earlier edition. All other editions I like to pretend don't exist... I certainly have no desire to keep repurchasing everything once every four or five years.

This is a fun game.  It took me a while to get into it, though.  Don't be afraid to try different armies, and be careful before you buy them, you may not like them after one or two games.  If you have a friend with multiple armies, that's always a good way to get a feel for who you like.  I've also heard people using markers in place to get to know the army.

Oops, there goes your cash! Despite what you may think of GW's pricing and marketing policies, this is a very entertaining tabletop game.

Still, I just love those minutes when the board is all set up with minis ... ready for mayhem.

Pros - Produced by the only games publisher in the UK to have accessable and dedicated stores/staff/support. Pretty easy to find opponents.
Cons - Potential money pit, years of painting. Also the older you are, the more of a perfectionist you'll probably be, so a bed sheet draped over a few pillows will no longer cut it for scenery. Cue hours of sawing, gluing and painting as you strive to build a better battlefield.

*Previously owned 2nd and 3rd Edition rulebooks.
Previously owned 6th and 7th Edition rulebooks plus 6th Edition Box set.

I think I'll always return to this game of toy soldiers, endless painting, converting and modelling.

I played this a fair bit through my teenage years. It really suffered from power gaming and "beardy" lists as well as the general arms race among friends that happens when people invest in new units. I remember having some fun battles but also some really frustrating games. I must have spent 1000s of pounds over the years I had Orcs & Goblins, Dwarves, High Elves, Wood Elves and some Chaos bits and pieces.

One of my favorite games back in the days, but too much investment (both time and cost). With the retrospective, I think I consider this game more as a lore than a proper game system. The game system is pretty bad when you think about it. It's meant to be a simulation but it just makes the game so slow, and leads to crazy situations more than often. I think building an army is the most interesting part of the game, then the rest is just a dice battle. There is almost no strategy once you have placed your units. Feels like a football manager game, where the team is set and strategy is set, then you let the CPU roll the dice for your games.

Some of my fondest gaming memories are Warhammer sessions... but I've really fallen out of the hobby since my daughter was born.  Fun to paint and play with a regular group.  Not a great choice for those that lack dedication :)

I use this for background.  The counters are helpful as well.

Good game, but I'm lazy to paint the models and to collect an entire army is too expensive for my wallet. So I stay in skirmish games.

A fantastic and strategic game - although a little pricey. Armies: Empire, Orcs & Goblins, and Wood Elves.

It lacks the speed and flow of 40K though, and often the tactical options are somewhat obvious. The game also tends to be very rock/paper/scissors.

Although the core rules are solidly, the most recent year or so of Army Books has been wildly unbalanced with previous releases. This makes the game all but unplayable if it's old army vs. new.

My first miniatures game.  I moved on when I found that this game was dominated by Uber-characters and army of the week syndrome.  It's ok for what it is, but there are much better options out there.

[i]GW game. The game isn't annoying, but the publisher is, to a degree that I will not play or support their products. Orginally rated this a 6, but GW just sucks the fun out of playing their games. Original comment:[/i]
Shane Yeager wrote: "GW's core competency is marketing, not quality rule sets for TTGs" Totally agree! 
I bought for hundreds of dollars. Empire and Orcs. 3000 points-armies. Then a new ruleset appears. Half my armies can't be used anymore, troops don't exist in the new&improved rules. The other half is worth half due to point-inflation. So I'm left with 2 750-point-armies. Tournies demand more, so I would have to buy more, go figure. Score: 7 points for the fun of warring with Orcs, but minus points for being GW

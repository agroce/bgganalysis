It isn't that bad, but lacks variety. There aren't very many card types. I do enjoy the multiple costs, but there's a limit to them. Gold becomes worthless and so does the other resource late in the game - then only military is worthwhile. This feels like a design problem somehow. The neutral cities also are boring. So it just doesn't reach the level of interesting for me.

De formar mazo tipo Dominion quiza con menos combos, pero con más opciciones de tipos de juego y más interacción (que es lo que no me gusta del Dominion, el plan autista). Subimos de 8,2 a 8,5. Está bastante curioso, pero llevo pocas partidas, para saber si es bastante rejugable. Probada expansión.

 After several plays, this game has yet to blow my socks off. Races aren't balanced, and the cards don't seem to play off each other well.

6/7/13
I have given this another shot, but i'm still not overly impressed. I can see why so many people have said this needs an expansion. There just isn't enough cards, especially in the event decks. I cycle through them so quickly. The number of neutral cards is sparse. This game really needs more. I'm wavering on getting the Oath and Anvil expansion...wondering if it adds enough to justify keeping the set.

RATING: 5
This game is dry and it uses deck building which is one of my most hated mechanics, I like the Runebound universe but this one even though it has great artwork it could borrow any theme. Some unique mechanics and clans play differently with variability in the type of scenarios but you need the expansion as it may quickly become repetitive.

Played once, although that was with expansion. I'm not sure how you could play without the expansion, since there are so few choices to begin with. Decent deck builder with the ability to attack each other more than say Dominion. But the races are kind of unbalanced (like Elves are pretty bad), which is a minus.

Gra na którą psiączą i chwalą pod niebiosa. Jeden z kilku pierwszych produktów powstałych na fali 'wynalezionej' przez Dominiona mechaniki deck-building. Mechaniką zajął się Corey Konieczka, amerykański Trashowiec. Ciekawa gra. Nie jedna z tych, którą po zagraniu u kogoś muszę mieć, ale jakby mi ktoś zaproponował jeszcze jedną partyjkę, to z chęcią bym pograł. Prosta, daje trochę możliwości różnego poprowadzenia rozgrywki, całkiem przyzwoita.

A combination of other more meaty deck-builders, with a Terrinoth paint job -  obviously Dominion, and a touch of Thunderstone. If felt too light, like there were not enough cards (in hand or on the table), and didn't have the same satisfaction of building up long chained plays. There were some interesting ideas, but the whole thing felt like a deck-builder for the sake of theme rather than gameplay.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
More plays will be necessary.

That said, I found the game a bit stilted and not particularly fun. I've only played a single, two player, experience -- I believe it was the Rise of the DragonLord scenario. Interaction with the other player was negligible, and the interaction with the game (i.e. combat encounters arising from events) were fairly dry. 

Most of the cards in any faction appear really geared towards direct (player vs player) conflict. This translated to many abilities not being viable in the game, something that makes the non-PvP modes feel tacked on. I somewhat regret the purchase, but more plays are necessary. Maybe I'll grow to appreciate it more. After all, we lost; I can't really say I understand the nuances till I can anticipate solid wins. 

One positive is the deck building seemed novel -- the game really gives incentive to keep your deck trim. Its an economical style of play which benefits most deck builders, but I rarely feel is actively encouraged by the design.

RATING: 8.1
I love it! I have a strong feeling that I am currently running the risk of burning it out as I have been playing it a lot as of late. The multiple scenarios and variable play offers a lot of replay ability for me.

RATING: 7
Great concept.  I want to love this game, but I'm not wild about performing combat with only the 5 cards in your hand.  Sometimes the flow of the PVP game gets very repetitive (kill dragons, buy dragons, repeat).  Looking forward to expansion.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
First scenario was ... unimpressive. I didn't understand the reasoning behind three currencies, and the influence currency was definitely unusual (in that it based on bases in front of you and was almost always going to be the same). I'm willing to give another try with one of the more interactive scenarios.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This is really close to being a decent deckbuilder, but has a few issues that really cripple it (some of which are fixed by the expansion)

A: as everyone on earth has noted, the elves are very weak, and dependent on the existence of strong neutrals.
B: For a deckbuilder, there is a surprising lack of variety, and it's extremely possible to screw one player out of the ONLY deck-thinning card in the scenario.
C: Linear strategies... while on a small level you can vary what you want to do with your deck, it seems that there is a pretty linear path to victory. More victory conditions would help here.
D: Player elimination in the PvP scenario. Ugh.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Seems like it could be good, but the learning curve is surprisingly steep.  It might end up being one of those games that one strategy will win, so it's just a matter of learning the game.  Not sure, but willing to play again.

After a handful of solitaire plays, I quite like the game, intuitive deck building mechanics and the abilities on cards feel appropriately thematic. It might be the 'smallest' of the Terrinoth games, and even with the expansion there are only so many scenarios, but you can vary them up between solo play, competitive and co-op and for what it presents, it's engaging. Art is nice too.

Rune Age is a fairly light deckbuilding game which adds some much-needed variability to this era of the genre. The game can suffer a bit from common deckbuilding pitfalls like "buy the best thing you can afford" or "I can't really do anything this turn," but other aspects of the game make up for it in the long run. The 4 scenarios vary in their focus, and the ability to play directly head-to-head (deploying units to destroy other players home realm) is a fun addition to a game that can also be played in full cooperative mode. Nice look and feel, too. The bottom line -- I always enjoy it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I mainly play this game for Cataclysm, a very tough scenario.  It is nice having other scenarios available though.  I'd probably rather play another deck builder rather than play another scenario in most instances.

Cataclysm is real tough and fun to revisit. Resurgance of the Dragonlords is also a scenario that I play on occasion.

I find that coop and solo play is why I keep coming back to this game.  It's not that this game is bad for competitive play, but I'd rather play some other deck builder for competitive play.

This game took a while before I started enjoying it.  I'm not sure why it's the case, but the first several plays, I wasn't impressed by the game and wasn't very eager to play it again.  I am quite fond of the game now though.  It probably has to do with getting used to the rules as the rulebook isn't the best.

Deck building in this game is about managing deck thinning.  Unlike most other deck builders, this game keeps decks pretty thin.

Pros:
Asymmetry due to different races
Made different modes of play
Component quality

Cons:
Very limited variability without expansion
With expansion still limited variability
Rulebook isn't the best

A good game within the Lore of Runebound. Deck builder with limited cards but with 6 different armies and solo play, co op play and PvP.

Base Rune Age is a fun deck builder with a few different ways to play. I prefer the co-op, but you can go full on attack mode as well. The decks are very asymmetrical and have a thematic feel. Solid game, but the expansion (see below) is an absolute MUST if you do get the base game.

[url=http://ballearicus.blogspot.com/2011/11/rune-age.html]Rune Age[/url] es el juego más temático, tenso y divertido que hasta ahora he probado con esta mecánica (DBG). Esta bien diseñado y parece equilibrado a pesar de ser asimétrico. Se vive la historia en cada escenario.

FFG lo ha vuelto a conseguir. Con una temática que tiene en exclusiva y la mecánica de moda en la actualidad, le da una vuelta de tuerca mejorando el sistema, añadiendo cositas que mejora las sensaciones de juego. El arte gráfico a las cartas simplemente impresionante y hace que se vivamos una magnifica aventura.

RATING: 6
There are just too many deck builders around and all of them look the same, which means exactly like Rune Age, even though - unlike most of them - Rune Age makes direct conflict with the other players its cornerstone, an improvement over the average card game.

Moreover, whilst on the one side its heavily-developed theme leads to a different basic deck for each faction (another improvement, over the typical mandatory equality), on the other the game’s lack of originality makes playing it quite shallow: you don’t feel like you’re dabbling with anything new or innovative as you try to build your deck and make the best out of the few available choices (a third improvement, over the usual cards bonanza).

All in all though, despite the attempt at improving the way it plays, the game feels dull.

I passed over this one when it came out because after 50+ plays I was bored of Dominion and had been thoroughly underwhelmed by Thunderstone.

Had a discussion about what I wanted to see in a deckbuilder with Damon last week and realised this one had most of it - some persistent cards, no artificial limitations on number of actions or order of actions, representations of armies and cities. Ordered it that night.

I've played dragonlords once solo, and cataclysm three times solo (with no win yet). Played Monument and Cataclysm with Dave last night, won the former and lost the latter.

I like the flexibility of the scenarios, especially the distinctions between Monument and Dragonlords. I like that the factions play differently. This might be the deckbuilder that makes most use of the mechanism other than Eminent Domain, especially after the disappointment of Core Worlds.

Others say:  high learning curve (experienced players will almost always win), base game is limited and really needs an expansion to add variety/options, pre-set variable player powers and pre-set race-specific cards can get old as players figure out the best card combos and this also means that experienced players should/will beat the crap out of newbies.

OK, REALLY getting sick of being bombarded with so many deck-building games, and it is too bad... this is a COOL deck-building game. This is DEFINITELY more fun than LotR, more fun than Arctic Scavengers, more fun than Tanto Quor, more fun than Ido, more fun than even Thunderstone.  If I hadn't already bought Thunderstone, this would DEFINITELY be my 3rd favorite deck-building game (1st = Dominion, 2nd = Quarriors) and I would buy it.

I like the Event deck a LOT.

I like that I can attack my opponents as well as cards in the field.  (My biggest complaint of LotR is that it is coop.)

I like the different factions each player has that give each player slight different strategies.

I like that there is a great game with PLENTY of replay value in such a small box with a small price!

But, I just don't love teaching yet another deck-building game to others and probably won't buy this.

UPDATE: I won it as a door prize at Barcon 2011!

Disappointing - but I had such high expectations (as I love Runewars).

The 4 races are different (although humans/undead seem a mirror of each other) but the actual deck building aspect is fairly minimal with only 3 shared card piles (that soon exhaust).

Played it and overall feeling was 'is that it ...' 

Like the art, like the idea, all a bit of a missed opportunity. Saying that I'd play this over Dominion any day of the week ...

No strong desire to own, might pick it up in a trade.

Es un juego de construcción de Mazo, tipo dominion, pero ambientado en el universo de Rune wars, y mucho más temático, desde luego. 
De 1 a 4 jugadores.
Cada Raza tiene sus propias características, aunque las unidades son básicamente las mismas. 

Se juega por escenarios, para los cuales, hay que cumplir un objetivo. El juego es semi-cooperativo. Todos luchan por ser el primero en cumplir el objetivo, pero también puedes atacar a otro jugador, si va demasiado bien, por ejemplo.

Está entretenido.

I like it that you have essentially three different ressources in Rune Age that follow each other. Our first game wasn't thaaaat intriguing but I'm sure that the others as well as the expansion will fix this. Well at least I hope so.

After a few plays the game leaves me pretty disappointed. The Co-Op scenario (that was our main intention to get the game) seems broken in the way that you can only win with the perfect draw. But we haven't tried the expansion yet.

Mixed feelings. On the one hand, the core game design is not bad - there is a neat balance with influence and gold, and the different factions are flavorful. But as is typical for FFG, it's a blender/microwave job of unfiltered ideas, and the scenario design is atrocious. Resurgence of the Dragonlords is railroaded as hell and  unbalanced against some factions. The ending conditions for both it and the Monuments, which hinge on getting exactly one huge hand, are dumb. The scenario advertised as cooperative has a backstabbing screw-you card which is totally out of place (I can't imagine anyone who wants to play a cooperative game wants this card in by default; it should be an option, instead of having an optional rule to remove it). The only sceanrio that appears rational is actually the PvP one. But then why do we have four scenarios? All four needed to be better-developed. And as usual, the rules are an utter train wreck.

Anyway. There is an interesting game in here, and I actuallay think many gamers will enjoy a few plays of this. But really, when I already have access to Thunderstone, Ascension, Nightfall, and Quarriors Rune Age just doesn't bring anything new to the table other than player eliminaton, attractive cards printed all the way to the edge, and the FFG universe. I wouldn't mind playing it again just to feel out the design space, but I can't see it having any legs.

---

I picked this up, and I'm not kidding in that I may have been swayed by the small box size, lower price point, and availability of store credits. The rules are the usual FFG mess, but it has some interesting features - rapid elimination and cycling of unit cards, some strategic options to hold and build up a good hand, and a streamlined card acquisition/turn process. Plus the event deck is an interesting touch, albeit somewhat sketchy as the first player will *always* have the first crack at acquiring rewards. And like most FFG designs, it definitely feels like more of a pieces-parts game than an actual design, with bits liberally stolen from Dominion, Thunderstone, and their LCG line with little that's very original. The "trying to be all things to all people" with cooperative, competitive, semi-competitive, and cutthroat versions doesn't inspire huge confidence, as I generally like to think that in today's market games should pick something and do it well. But ... it looks like it's got some potential and I look forward to giving it a try with the benefit of low expectations.

We're at the point now though that good deck-builders have been done, and if you want to do yet another one you'll need to do more than just throw some ideas together.

My first Deck builder (gasp, I know, I have never played Dominion).  It went very well, quick play, fairly easy and intuitive rules, and the connection with Runewars is well appreciated, at least by me and my gaming group.

A few plays in, but this is one I won't be turning down.

I liked this a lot more than A Few Acres of Snow - both games add on to the deck building mechanic instead of just cloning Dominion.  The different factions with their own marketplace of cards don't seem to lend itself to an expansive array of strategical options, but the tactical battles between players and the different scenarios offer up more than enough fun to make the game worth it.

A game that uses 3 resources. Money->strength->influences ->money etc. makes hand management very important. Unfortunately the common deck is lacking a bit and randomness of draw is significant and contribute to wild swing. 

I don't feel a need to play again although I wouldn't say no to xplore more.

I like many of the ideas what this game wants to do.
I like the different starting decks and different own "market". This is neat.
I like the 3rd currency over the regular gold+attack pair.
I like the art.
I like how you have the option to keep cards in your hand for future turn instead of forced to discard everything unused at the end of your turn.

But... sadly I don't like the game so much. These -above- are all good ideas which don't really work in practice.
I hate that stupid skull die. Bah...
We played with the expansion and knowing what it gave to the game I also feel like the base game is half-empty.

I'm in love with deckbuilding but this one is among mediocre ones.

RATING: 7.5
As a solitaire game, a bit of a bust, although it's a good way to learn the game and the deck-building process (which is a little more scripted than in Dominion, say). The best element looks to be in the way the players will interact in various scenarios, especially in an antagonistic way, but I haven't gotten a chance to try that just yet. Giving this a provisional 7.5 for now based on the promise of multiplayer, but dinged a bit for weak solitaire.

First impression is that there are a lot of cards to deal with for setup.  Especially since there is no box insert to keep them straight.  I like that you can play solo or with others.  I also liked the options on available.  The dual currencies in the game give you plenty of decisions until the cards start running out.  Culling the deck can be a bit of a challenge, but I like how that is part of the strategy.  I also like the feel of the different player decks.  Rune Age fell a little flat for me, but the second play really shined.  The rules could be much better, but once you get them down it would be easy to teach.  The special abilities are unique, but well balanced.  I'm looking forward to playing the rest of the game types & with 4 players.

I feel that this game integrates theme into the DBG genre much better than Dominion; I love the different races and that there are multiple scenarios to play through, depending on the type of game you want to play. For the relatively low price point, this is a great game (though I, like everyone else, would love to see some expansions for it).

Deckbuilding feels rather limited since each faction has its own offer and the neutral offer is rather small. Limited number of event cards may hurt replayability but there are more neutral cards to randomize game play. Elves underpowered. Good card art as expected from FFG. The various game modes piques my interest but the limited deckbuilding counters it.

If there were no other deck-building games, I may hold this game in a higher regard.  As it stands, the mechanics and rules are a bit too clunky.  It's probably due to the various scenarios that it must accommodate.  There's just other deck-building games that are tighter and less chaotic.  I do like the idea of choosing different races and them playing differently.  Unfortunately they are not balanced well and some are much better than others depending on the scenario.

RATING: 6
Rating reduced after playing the co-op scenario.  This one has a lot going for it, and a lot going against it.   The setup and complexity is high for a deck builder.   So once you get everything going, it needs to work.  When it works (Resurgence of the Dragonlords) it's great fun.   When it doesn't (The Cataclysm) you feel like you wasted a lot of time.

At this point I have been playing the game solo just to get a feel for the armies. I've done the Rise of the Dragonlords with both the Humans and Undead and one thing that has impressed me so far is just how different the two factions feel at this point. The other part that impresses me is just how adaptable the system is with so many different ways to play. Even if I never get to experience the multiplayer game the solo game has turned out to be a pleasurable puzzle to solve, or at least understand better.

PERSONAL COPY. Love-or-hate-it deck-builder. While probably the least varied deck-builder, the expansion adds A LOT to it and I highly advise against getting this without the expansion. Plays quick if everyone has experience. Beautiful artwork, and decent card stock. Varied fun factor with different scenarios. Best with 3-4 players, not good with 2. Horrible solo game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
● Impulse purchase, bought it only because of the artwork and also because I dig the Terrinoth universe (I own Runewars, Dungeonquest 3rd Ed, and soon Runebound). The realm of Terrinoth is plain awesome!!

● Love the gorgeous artwork.

● Has 4 scenarios, meaning 4 playing mode. That's cool!

● Agreed that the game is already good, but it would be awesome to get more stuff for this game. Hopefully expansion is planned and in the pipeline.

● Reminds me so much of Runewars when playing this game.

● Didn't hurt that it comes in a small box. Also good that since the game is basically all cards, with minimal damage tokens, I could use deck boxes to bring this game when travelling

● You can play the 1st and 3rd scenario alone (solo), which I've won both. On one day, I played a total of 7 games back-to-back. The first 5 games was the 3rd scenario, and I won on the 3rd trial. The two last game was by playing the 1st scenario. I won it on 2nd trial. Fun experience. All 7 games by using the undead; my fav faction, which I also use when playing Runewars.

● This is something that I feel will play often when compared with Space Hulk Death Angel (as it's also a soloable card game by FFG). SH:DA has too much too handle in solo mode (there's too many bookeeping for me when controlling 3 teams). 

● I need more out of this game! I hope FFG will release some expansions for this one.

Rune Age is a relatively quick and light deckbuilding game that comes with numerous scenarios to appeal to a wide variety of gamer tastes.  There's a scenario for the following: racing to defeat a neutral enemy (light interaction), a co-op scenario, PvP where the last player standing wins, 1 player vs. the rest, and more.  This game has 3 resources which you'll want to balance: combat (usually used to get influence/attack other people), influence (doesn't clog your deck, gets you better money, spells/tactics, and neutral units) and money (to get units from your own faction).  Despite feeling like a relatively light game, has a bit of a puzzle element in how to balance the 3 resources against how your unique faction plays, and against the scenario.  This game is probably lacking enough variety without the expansion to be unenjoyable.  With the expansion, I think there's at least one scenario that everyone would enjoy if you like deckbuilding games.

At the time of commenting, I've played the Rune Wars scenario once and the Dragonlords scenario twice. In all, I've played as three of the four factions. I plan to give the Cataclysm cooperative scenario a try shortly. 

Rune Age, unfortunately, is not the game I was looking for. With the limited set of cards available in each game and the goals being so straightforward, it takes very little work to tune your deck to best fit the objective; the card combos seem too obvious and the strategies too easy. There's something to be said about the player versus player combat, which rather reminds me of Sid Meier's Civilization or even Battle Line/Lost Cities, but its not enough to carry the game. Each group I've played this with has likewise found Rune Age to be only "okay" (or even "meh").

To me, Puzzle Strike remains the ultimate two-player deck building game, but it scales poorly beyond that, while Dominion and Thunderstone continue to be acceptable when playing in groups of three or four. Ascension and Nightfall fell flat, and Rune Age has decreased my enthusiasm for Mage Knight: The Board Game. The only DBG left on my radar is Core Worlds. Hopefully that will blow me away.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It is a really nice game - I heard variability of cards is not so big as in other titles, but the point is Rune Age doesn't need a ton of different cards. This game is based on gameplay and tactical choices, not on deck building - and that is perfect for me.

EDIT: Expansion is practically necessary for this game - it provides as many cards as in base set and greatly improves overall gameplay and possibilities.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
A solid deck building game, although some of it feels sort of half baked. For example, some of the faction's unit abilities only function when you're battling another player (not a neutral enemy), so if you're playing a cooperative scenario... useless. Stuff like that.

Also, it's a bit anemic without the expansion.

I had a very nice evening with a friend of my when we played many games of Rune Age in a row! The art on cards looks great (FFG), I liked the deck building element on this game, and the use of influence was a refreshing newness for me. We had most fun with the challenging co-op scenario.

I even bought my friend's game later with a reasonable price. However, the next time I played the game with another friend I noticed that I didn't like Rune Age that much anymore. First of all, the Daqua Lords (Humans) tastes too powerful and broken compared with other Factions. Besides this game is in need of an expansion.

RATING: 3.5
Little bit dissapointed in this one as I have played twice and both times the game has ended with someone winning by sheer luck happening to draw a really good hand. The game feels like it ends just when you are really getting started.
 
The first scenario we played you needed to amass an attack of 18 points of damage to kill a dragon lord. The human player attacked pretty much on every turn and kept getting to 13-16 damage reliable but not quite enough to finish off the dragon lord.The demons spent the whole game being beaten on as they could not really raise a defense (they were 2 points from being eliminated) and they happened to luck into drawing the only points of damage in their deck which totaled 18 damage and so they won with their only attack of the game.

The second scenario was a race to 10-12 gold. A player managed to luck into finding all 3 of his 3 gold cards and his only remaining one gold card to win the game when it felt like we were all just getting started.

I have played a third game of this now and boy was it tedious. It was the dragon lord scenario again and there are so few cards available that it felt very lather rinse repeat. There was no competition for resources because you can amass so much so quickly which meant all the powerful neutral cards were bought quickly and as a result it became a tedious wait to see who drew a good hand first. 

YAWN.

I got it to go with my Runebound stuff to see what they're doing with the milieu. If it wasn't set in Terrinoth I'd be rid of it in a moment - too much like a mediocre Silver Line game and not expansive enough.

Fun deck-building game with nice artwork and high replay value.  Solitaire scenarios are great inclusion for when FTF isn't an option. Watch the How to Play video, it helps!

I find myself wanting to play through each scenario with each faction to understand the correct strategy.  Addicting game that will be my goto filler for the foreseeable future.  

Acquired 5/30/2017 from fellow Geek in VG condition.  Need to locate the expansion.

A lot about the gameplay makes me think I should dislike the game, but I actually really enjoy it.  There are some things about the rules that bother me, but the incredibly difficulty we had beating the game (and we lost every time) makes me enjoy it more.  A co-operative game should be difficult, though not impossible.  I fear it could become too predictable after a while, but so far I've really liked playing it 2-player.

We've only played the coop scenario, but it's a ton of fun.  Art is nice, tand he factions are well differentiated (although balance is still a question).  It's an okay deck builder so far, combining the fast play of Ascension with seemingly deeper strategies of Dominion or Thunderstone.

Farely quick and relatively simple cardgame set in the "Runebound" unvierse, this is my fantasy deckbuilder of choice. Artwork is good, theme is there and it retains the "simple to pick up, difficult to master"-mentality of games like Dominion while adding some additional mechanics to keep it interesting. It even features multiple game-modes, which seem to cater to almost every kind of crowd. Player-interaction is strong with lots of battles and the fact that everyone gets to pick their faction at the start of the game gives every player some special units and powers unique to them, which I always enjoy. Big thumbs up!

RATING: 7
Deck/tablue builder card game - each player has their own set of "troop" cards to buy plus there are "city" and "mercenary" troops available from a common pool. The game includes 4 scenarios which range from a co-operative bring down the "boss" monster to solo efficiency mode to everybody bash everybody melee. The expansion is a must as it adds a lot of variety.

Rules are simple and well laid out but some (quite a lot actually!) card wordings are a  bit imprecise requiring reference to the FAQ and BGG which makes play frustrating. Also some scenarios favour the forst player significantly.

Components are typical FFG quality with good art on the cards representing the Terrinoth Universe.

Good but spoiled by the card wording issues.

Hay que juzgar este título como lo que es: un sencillo juego de creación de mazos que sirve para pasar un rato agradable, sin más pretensiones. Hay cuatro facciones con las que jugar, y cada una tiene sus particularidades; me da la sensación de que jugar con unas es un reto mayor que con otras. Existe la posibilidad de jugar en solitario. En cualquier caso, no es un juego para jugar intensivamente, sino partidas esporádicas, de lo contrario se hace repetitivo.

RATING: 7
An original deck building game, where the mechanism itself "disappears" in the light of the scenarios being played. No longer you're playing a game that's a "point engine", but you're facing a scenario using deck building.

That said, there could be more options in the cards to get, which seem too limited. And the scenarios could have more cards that would be selected from a larger pool, this would be rather cool for the cooperative scenario where the "Brother against Brother" card could appear or not, making it a more unpredictable game, but more fun.

RATING: 7
Dominion was OK, Ascension a disappointment and Thunderstone didn´t impress me the way it should
Therefore I judge RuneAge as the one I enjoyed most of all those deck building games I know `til now (ok not considering Mage Knight tBG as there is some deckbuilding as well).
The first scenario offers player interaction where other games didn´t. The graphics are top notch.
However my play was already with the expansion so I had two more units to choose from and profited as well from a bit more effect cards etc. This surely adds to the enjoyment. So you may deduct 0.5 from my rating to consider the effect of the expansion cards. As usual rating may change with further plays.

RATING: 7
Basic deck-building game, but I like that there are different factions and scenarios, although card choices are quite limited. It doesn't solve the problem of randomness that plagues other games in the genre, and in fact the events may bring huge swings of luck, but at least it plays a lot faster than "Thunderstone" or "Star Trek". It seems underdeveloped, there is likely some imbalance, and it has a clear turn order problem in that the first player always has first shot at enemies. There is nothing really special about it, and I'm uncertain about replayability, but so far I have enjoyed the setting, the nice artwork and the surprisingly simple and dynamic gameplay.

Construccion de mazos y ambientado en Terrinoth. 

Tal vez no sea el mejor deck builder per se, pero dentro del genero es uno bastante redondo, no demasiado complejo en interacciones (en mi opinion el peor defecto para esta clase de juegos), con bastantes modos de juego realmente diferentes entre si, y 6 razas distintas tambien realmente diferentes entre si pero al mismo tiempo bastante balanceadas.

Rune Age is a deckbuilding game set in Fantasy Flight Games' proprietary universe, Terrinoth. Fans of Descent, Rune Wars, Runebound, etc. will recognize some of these characters and artwork. A lot of people seem to think this is a cost-saving measure, and I'm sure that's true to some degree, but I happen to like the concept of the same world spanning several games.

This game owes a lot to Dominion, no question. The main change it makes is that rather than having 10 cards in the middle that anyone can buy, it only has 3. Then each player gets a faction which includes 4 cards that only they can buy. It really gives a different feel to playing each faction, yet it maintains the competition of being the first to get a certain valuable card before other players do.

I almost can't explain the variety and replayability this tiny $25 game offers. There are four factions that are very well-balanced against each other, but not in the way you might expect. You see, Rune Age comes with 4 different scenarios. One is co-operative, one is a race build up a set amount of gold, one is a race to defeat a huge dragon (though you can also kill other players to win), and one (my favorite) is simply about killing everyone else before they kill you. Obviously, these scenarios each require a different play style, but each FACTION also requires a different play style. It feels like you need to master about 16 different approaches to be able to succeed with any deck at any scenario. There may be a scenario where one of your cards is extremely useful, and yet in the next scenario you never buy it. Deciding how to build your deck is equally important to how you actually play the cards and what you attack.

It's my favorite deckbuilding game of all time. And it's so cheap you can't afford not to own it. Give this one a go if you haven't yet. I've found it has appeal to almost all types of gamer.

Only played the coop game.  Initial coop is rather difficult, if you don't have the right mix of races.

With the expansion [gameid=124300], the included coop is more enjoyable.

As a versus game, it is probably good, as each race has it's strengths and weaknesses.

Each race feels and plays very differently!  Typical Corey Konieczka goodness!  :)

One of the very few deckbuilding games I have. What makes this interesting is the fact that it's Terrinoth game (perhaps my favorite fictional boardgame related realm) and that it's highly adjustable. It's based on scenarios and depending on what scenarios you play, it could be PvP, co-op or even asymmetric gameplay. Recommendable.

I am still underwhelmed by this game.  Although each race feels slightly distinct, the small amount of shared pool cards means there will be nowhere near the deck composition variety that games like Dominion and Trains are able to offer.  The cooperative scenario is interesting, but feels like the difficulty is tuned way up.  The right drawing of cards can guarantee a loss.  Unlike games like Pandemic that provide a procedurally random landscape to clean, Rune Age feels punishing as there is no way to avert crises.  For example, the card that adds 1 token per player turn until an automatic loss once it has 8 tokens.  If you drew that event right away in a 4-player game, you may as well start over.  With only three total turns before you automatically lose, and no way to partially hurt or wound an enemy, you need a lot of strength very early on.  The rulebook is sloppily written and too large for what it offers.  Ultimately, this game fell flat for me and anyone I've played it with and simply superior card games fill this niche.

Rune Age is a different take on the deckbuilder, and for that alone it would deserve some love.

Unfortunately, like many a deckbuilder the biggest foes (objectives, etc.) require a while to build up to, or a near miracle hand.

The game, imperfect as it was, creates a lot of tempting inter-player stabs and sqalling, so it's a game to be cautious one's toes about.

Based on a 1st play, I'm giving this a 6.75 to start.

Es un juego asimétrico basado en cuatro escenarios distintos con la mecánica de los Deck Building Games (DBG) en el que las condiciones de victoria cambian en función del escenario (desde "el último que quede vivo, gana" a "tenemos que matar al jefe enemigo entre todos"). Como principal atractivo está su mejor punto fuerte: que hay interacción con el contrario. Además, añade gestión de recursos y gestión de la mano, al haber 3 recursos distintos en el juego: dinero, que sirve para construir unidades que te dan fuerza, que te permite conquistar ciudades que te dan el tercer recurso: influencia que sirve para nuevas opciones estratégicas o conseguir más unidades. Algunos dicen que es el mejor DBG, pero Dominion llegó antes. PROS: posibilidad de jugar en solitario. Añade interacción real. CONS: necesita expansiones porque se queda corto enseguida. Realmente, hay poco de DBG al haber sólo 3 cartas comunes en cada escenario.

Good game, with a DBG mechanic built into it. If your friends don't dig DBG games bring this game to make them appreciate the genre more. Un juego divertido que se puede jugar cooperativo y competitivo. Uno construye un mazo pequeño en rondas rápidas para enfrentar un mazo de eventos bastante agresivo. El modo solitario, sin embargo, es débil.

This might be the best combative deck building game thus far.  Each faction feels very different.  And there are plenty of meaningful choices, both in what cards to purchase and what objective/target to go for/attack next.  And there are several modes of play (free-for-all, cooperative, etc).  I'd love to play this one again.

Deck building of a very different kind.  In fact, since cards can be returned to the supply pretty frequently, it seems that it is hard to get a really good engine going.  Also, the scenerios (that I've tried) end just when they start to become fun.  I do, however, LOVE the art and the components are top-notch.  Maybe it needs an expansion or two to fill it out some.  As is, okay game.

Definitely a cut above your average "deck-builder". That mechanic feels like an important part of the game, but not the ONLY thing going on. The multiple factions and modes of play (co-op, last-man-standing, economic victory, non-eliminative domination) really give you a lot of variety. It almost feels like a smorgasborg of games. I highly recommend the expansion.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (April 2012)

At first I was very keen to play this, however after 2 plays some of the game mechanics let me down. 

I really like that each player has a different deck, however I’m concerned with deck balance, in our games the Latari Elves seemed to be underpowered comparing it to the other factions. I also like that the game comes with different scenarios (I have played the first one twice), however I found this to be unfair as the first players (seem to) have an advantage, perhaps this can be reduced between player`s attacks BUT I do not like this mechanic very much, however it is novel. It is nice that the theme has congruence with other Terrinoth games. The players have a personal and a common pool of cards, as the cards are the same and don’t depend of luck if you can get them I approve of this wholehearted. I also approve of the 3 different currencies of the game.

For me, the game comes with too few scenarios, I hope they release more soon. Also the games comes with too few cards per faction. Both of that factors led me to question the replayability of the game. The event deck has too much luck for my liking, although it offers a novel and thematic approach. Both of my games took a long time to finish, we bought all the relevant cards but we had to play a lot of turns until a player got lucky to get the necessary damage to win the game :S. IMO the game is for 2 players (3 max), with more the game begins to drag.

In conclusion, I have mixed feelings. I’m rating it a 5.0 for now and I want to play it again to re comment and re rate, however, Dominion still is the king of the deckbuilders for me.

I was all ready to not like this, as I feared it would be too similar to Thunderstone (which, in turn, I feel is too similar to Dominion).  But after playing it, I really liked it.

RATING: 6
Tough game to rate.  I find it offers a quick-playing diversion and the diceless combat actually works pretty well here.  However, the game is held back by its thin pool of cards.  The first is the available cards are very constrained - each faction's deck is geared towards a particular engine and with just four choices for cards, there isn't much variety when it comes to the deckbuilding.  A similar problem afflicts the neutral cards, where there is a very limited selection of cards for each scenario and these are assembled into piles which deplete quickly.  I sometimes wonder if an Ascension-style tableau (shuffle a broader mix of the neutral cards together but deal a limited # out at any given time) would make for more interesting play.

The expansion dramatically improves the core game - with Oath and Anvil thrown in, it is at least an eight.

My son and I enjoy this deck builder ALOT (he actually dislikes deck building games).  This game works because you have limited cards to build your deck, but it is very clear what each cards function is, quality over quantity.  

You get four races that play very differently from each other, but I do feel WITH the limited card pool you basically play each race the way they were intended with little in varying strategies.  I hope the expansions changes this.

I also love the inclusion of scenarios that give you different ways to play the game. Really smart idea that I'd like to see done in other games.

A clever and more intuitive version of Dominion. Unlike other Dom-clones, there is no restriction on "buys" which makes so much more sense to new players. Also, players get their own special decks which are built to work together. Great!

As a self-contained game, its works well. However because each scenario uses the same cards, there is limited replayability.

The limited card pool and issues with the importance of play order hem this one from reaching its full potential.

Still trying to make up my mind on this little deckbuilder.  I go back and forth from thinking it is quite good, to thinking it is bad to thinking in needs an expansion to make it good.  I still haven't yet made up my mind really.

*Edit* I've decided this is a good enough game to keep.  Though if you get it, you'll want the expansion soon as the options in the base game are somewhat limited.

My replacement for Dominion! Finally there is something more in deck building than just buying cards!

2014-07-21 - I need to lower the rating. It's a good game, but not for 8.5 ->7.4

As a result I will lower Dominion as well.

2014-09-03 - 7.4->7.1

2015-10-19 - It's fine 7.1->7. Deckbuilding is OK but not as a main part of the game for me.

2016-04-04 - 7->6 - Deckbuilders are not my genre and I prefer them sometimes as the mechanism, not the game itself, although I can play it from time to time.

感想：

2. 基本上我十分喜歡主題 (魔幻類)，但玩完後我發現我不喜歡玩牌組構築遊戲
4. 遊戲來說我喜歡他有不同模式 (包括死戰, 合作, 競速打王, 跑文明等)
5. 每個種族也感覺到其特式而做成的玩法不同
6. 那種不斷構築牌組，然後準備好便爆死對方的感覺不錯
7. 但文字量高是死症 (故此DISLIKE 牌組構築)，如何理解技能文字的描寫很重要

Great solo DBG - really challenging, another winner from FFG! A real bonus is that Rune Age is a blast to play cooperatively when combined with beer & pretzels!

This is a wonderful fantasy-themed, monster-slapping, Amerishtrash-lite solo-able game for euro gamers like me who generally don't like that sort of stuff. Terrific FFG production values - great artwork, solid components, great rulebook. Not a big game as such, with possibly limited replayability, but with four factions to explore and objectives of varying complexity there is a heck of a lot of game in a relatively small box for what is in effect just a deck-building card game. By the designer of Space Hulk Death Angel, so no surprise there. Plus expansion.

I expected to like this game, but then I got left behind in the beginning, and was stuck with nothing to do for a good 5 turns before I was mercifully put down by a crazed dragon. It seems like there needs to be more options later in the game, and you better not make newbie mistakes early on. At any rate, not alot of interesting options, and this is before all the cards ran out.

So far I have to say this game is a bit over rated for solitaire play. It adds a great splash of theme to the deckbuilding genre but the gameplay just isn't as good. Particularly discouraging is that the best part of the game (managing different kinds of resources) quickly becomes inconsequential and in fact a significant draw back to your deck. It's not very interesting to build up a good money engine and then run out of good things to buy.

Rune Age is a deck-building game of adventure and conquest for 1-4 players. Set in the fantasy realm of Terrinoth (Runebound, Descent: Journeys in the Dark, Runewars, and DungeonQuest), Rune Age puts players in control of one of four races, vying for dominance in a world embroiled in conflict.

Designed by Corey Konieczka, Rune Age is a unique deck-building game that centers around scenarios. The four different scenarios included in Rune Age present alternate win conditions for players, from an all-out war to determine the victor to a cooperative game experience where players all win or lose together. Scenarios not only dictate the win conditions, they also determine which card types will populate Terrinoth (forming the central card pools) and which Event cards will form the Event deck. The Event deck contains thematic challenges, enemies, and happenings that are tied to the chosen scenario, creating a new play environment each turn.

Gameplay in Rune Age centers around players working to develop their individual deck of cards. At the beginning of the game, each player begins with a small assortment of cards in their deck, drawing five cards each turn to carry out their actions. Each player's deck represents their faction's military strength and capabilities. These decks will be formed with their faction-specific Unit cards and a central collection of Neutral Unit cards, Tactics cards, and Gold cards.

Deck building que ofrece la posibilidad de jugar escenarios cooprativos o competitivos, combates épicos entre jugadores más logrados que en el Thunderstone (en mi opinión).

RATING: 8
This is a very good game. It is much more complex that it looks. So you need to play a few games before understanding the strategy of the game.

For those you who are experienced with deck building games, this game is generally fit for people who like the deck building mechanics but did not really like the popular games out there like Dominion and Thunderstone.

The reason why is that most deck building game focus on identifying what is the most abusive combos of the game and take advantage of it. In rune age, you are building an army that can be used for accomplishing various objectives. The game play is totally different since every player has his own set of cards from which he can buy his units. Cards can also be lost during battles.

Personally, I think it's one of the best deck building game and other deck building should follow this game's path instead of the dominion path.

The expansion seems to fix most of the issues of the game.

Rune Age is just okay really. Assymetrical deck building game, which sounds really fucking awesome just turned out to be "meh" to me. The idea still sounds really sweet, but the implementation didn't really wow me all that much. This is definitely one of the best looking deck building games out there, but the game play didn't match the artwork. I would definitely play again if given the oppurtunity, but in the long run I already have a better deck building game to play.

Tentative 8 with a high chance of rising.

Rune Age is like:

- Night Fall in that each player has personal draft piles

- LotR the LCG in that you choose a scenario which has goals and sets the central draft piles

- Thunderstone in that you have a main deck that brings out enemies and events

That being said it plays like none of them. It's a 30 minute game full of fast play and neat combos. 

Pluses:

- Awesome art

- Scenarios range from non interactive competition to fully pvp

- There are 4 factions each with their own style and unique draft piles

- Quick set up and break down 

I think the game fills the same kind of filler niche as Dominion but while taking the best of many of its fore runners RA remains a beast all it's own.

[microbadge=13167][microbadge=670]([microbadge=5792])

[size=18][b]Best of 2011[/b][/size]

Rune Age turns deck-building upside-down with a few different innovations.  First, no countable actions or buys make the game much more tense, since your turn is completely limited on your hand, and there are virtually no drawing-powers or deck-cycling powers (and the ones that are there largely rely on pseudo-trash cards).  Second, scenario based gameplay creates a number of different potential strategies from one simple base game.  Out of the box, the game supports team co-op, race for money, race for army, or free-for-all combat.  Find another game that does that.

(My other contender for Best of 2011 is another deckbuilder: Core Worlds.)

Rating after one play.

This one sits firmly in the "Meh" category. Technically, there's nothing offensively bad here, but there's nothing particularly good here either. What you get instead are mechanics tacked on the basic Dominion-clone of a game, a generic fantasy setting which is a pain to look at, and a pretty boring game in general. Nothing here to grab my attention.

This is another one of Konieczka's designs which I just can't appreciate in any way.

[Played 5 times]

The engine works fine, but the extremely limited card pool kills much of the replay value (having four scenarios is not nearly enough, as the tools to face them are mostly the same).
Luck has quite a role (not only drawing cards - and event cards in particular - but the die too).
I've also some doubts on balance (only partially excusable because of the asymmetry).
Overall, more promising than fulfilling (and less interesting than many other deck builders).

Bought it very cheap in the past mostly for co-op scenario. While it can be played purely co-op by removing one card that makes it PVP for the turn and it was fun for some plays - it didn't last for long. Since you always use same deck of event cards for co-op scenario (goal is to finnish deck without dying) it grow stale quite soon even if you can try playing it with one of four factions. Quite good game just don't have any replayability as co-op game. Also co-op scenario is very very hard (can't remember if I won, but we really came very close few times).

RATING: 8
Rune Age is the second game I’ve played after Nightfall that can claim Dominion as an inspiration instead of a blueprint, and it is the first one to really succeed for me. Its biggest changes are the asymmetrical factions and the subtly different goal of having to optimize your hand rather than your deck. Colourful fantasy illustrations and a reunion with the Runewars factions help with making this feel a lot less abstract than most of the other deckbuilders so far.

From a couple of two-player sessions, cries for an immediate expansion strike me as a completely unnecessary knee-jerk reaction - even when sticking to the same scenario, playing with different factions is a noticable change in pacing and strategy, and the different order of event cards can also have a serious impact on your game. Furthermore, the high level of interaction due to the possibility of attacking other homerealms and (a bit less obvious) the thin supply of the powerful neutral cards should be a big boost to replayability.

So far, I’m very happy with this, and I can see it rising further if it should prove to be as much fun with a bigger crowd.

A nice flexible deck building game based in Terrinoth. I am a sucker for Terrinoth themed games so I am a bit partial, but this game just plays nicely. The different scenarios all give you a different way to play.

First look it always looks like there are not enough cards on the table for you to purchase, but the game just plays right, and plays fast.

An expansion to bolster the event decks, player barracks, and neutral cards would make this an exceptional game.

And remember you don't have to play with JUST the cards they tell you to, put out your own neutrals and have fun!

Once I figured out what the heck to do with this game (the included rule sheet is baffling in its omissions and lack of explanations on actual gameplay) I discovered that this is one heck of a card game.  Great theme, and the added objectives and scenarios and player interaction take the deckbuilding idea and make it much richer.  This is a very, very fun game, and even though FF gives it a 14+ rating, I've enjoyed it greatly with my 8 year old, and he loves it as well.

The worst thing they could do to harm Rune Age was featuring 'Deck Building' on the cover. It's far more than that. Because of the direct confrontation and the seriously limited shared and faction specific resources, it's much more about hand management, timing and skill, and thus the experience is way closer to something like MtG or Condottiere than Dominion.

Not a bad game, but not a whole lot going on from turn to turn. Just as easy to play alone than play with a group.  Maybe just an issue with the genre (deck-building), but I was kind of bored with this one after one game.  I did like the art though, and enjoyed the mechanics of playing the Undead deck (my favorite).  Reminds me somewhat of Magic in that each deck plays so differently and forces you to consider that when taking on that faction. Purple (Undead) plays like a hybrid Blue/Black, Green (Elves) like a White deck, Red (Orcs?) plays like a Black/Red combo deck, and white (Humans) plays like a Knight/Soldier deck.  Give it a shot and see what you think. Plays 1-4, fyi.

The Runewars competitive scenario is by far the best part of this game, and I think it could have been better by focusing on that instead of trying to work with a mix of scenarios that require different design goals.

The decks are so small that there is not much variety in strategies once you've become familiar with them.

[u]06-Sep-2013[/u]:  I picked this up specifically for its solo play.  While my first play or two didn't grab my attention that much, I'm increasing enjoying this game the more I play it.

It's a deckbuilding game (a la Dominion) set in FFG's Terinoth universe.  I like the setting, the theme, the art, and the quality of the components.  My initial trepidation is in the seeming lack of choice for the solo player in the first solo scenario (Resurgence of the Dragonlords).  I was able to win this one with all four factions rather easily and through rather obvious strategies.

I have only played the second scenario twice so far and am not ready to comment in detail.  So far, though, it seems more of a challenge.  And that's a good thing.

The game is lighter than I expected and plays rather quickly.  Once I got into that headspace when playing this one, I began to enjoy it more.  However, I can already see the potentially increased fun factor of the mulitplayer game.  It appears that with additional players fighting for common cards and goals, the competition would probably add to the game's overall feel.

For now, I'm pleased with the game.  I want to play out the second scenario with the rest of the factions and just the base set of cards.  Then, I'll add in the expansion and hope to see additional challenges and choices.

[u]24-Jan-2014[/u]:  This was tied for my second most played game in 2013.  I had a lot of fun with this one as I explored the base game.  I finally broke into the expansion in my last play or two, but there is still so much more for me to experience.

I know there is a lot of debate about whether this is a good game for solitaire only play, but I don't know why that is.  It's a solid deckbuilding game.  It's on the lighter side and plays rather quickly.  It may not be too thinky, but that doesn't mean it isn't enjoyable.

With the expansion, there are so many factions to choose and several different solitaire and co-op scenarios to play.  I like the theme, the art, and the quality of the components.

Does it really shine in its mulitplayer format?  Maybe.  But how would I know?  I like this as a solo game and would recommend it as such.

A huge delusion (but, please, read to the end)

Even if the game is nicely playable, rules are well written, solo mode is huge bonus, nice cards et al, variety is ridiculously poor, with so few different cards it's almost embarassing. I understand it's not its real target, but after having played Magic for year and Dominion just recently, Run Age fade away very quickly. And, again, it's shame because its promises are very good; with just an expansion (a great expansion, with lot of neutral cards, not the already avalaible that add to it just a bunch of nothing), it would be a really fantastic game.


IMPORTANT NOTE: be warned that my opinion is largely based on being an italian purchaser, that it means that I had to pay the game a whopping equivalent of 46 dollar!! Not to speak the 34 dollars I should pay for the expansion!
For that money I honestly expected a bit more. For the US price, I would easily raise the game rating up to 7; still a lack in variety, but an honest purchase.

A fun deck builder that allows for cooperative, semi-cooperative and player vs. player gameplay.  I find this game much more interesting than other, similar, deck builders because of the inclusion of a personal card pool with a shared card pool, a third 'economy' and the event cards -- making it seem a much more fleshed out game than just finding the optimal combination of cards at the right time to wipe your opponents up with.

Picked up with a B&N gift card (nothing else really of interest.)

So far this seems significantly more interesting than the other deckbuilders I've played: it seems to require tactical adjustment, and the fact that it allows for players to directly attack each other seems somewhat significant. So far, I've only tried the solo game, but I could see the rating go up with plays of the full game.
--------------

03/12 - Ratings bump after multi-player game. Nicely vicious and competitive - ALL three players were eliminated without winning in our game because we were as busy being at each other's throats as building our decks to victory! Looking forward to future plays.

Have yet to play this enough to confirm whether or not it suffers from the same problem as all deckbuilders do - a kind of shallowness inherent to the design that can only be corrected by continuing to buy expansion after expansion.

Wish this game would get the attention it deserves. Five games in and I just managed to sneak my first win against the dragonlords. Challenging and full of decisions. Ok Rune age doesn't have the plethora of cards some so called great card games have but it strips away all of the fat and leaves you with a lean, intense, fun game. Each race really feels unique to play. Great value for money too. Four scenarios with a ton of options to develop more if fantasy flight get behind it. Saying that they wont unless folks buy it. So stop thinking about it and treat yourself to a hidden classic dare I say.

I've only played solo games so I will re-evaluate and adjust my score after some multi-player games.  With that said, my initial impressions are positive - I'm having a lot of fun trying out the different factions using the first solo scenario.  I play Ascension and have only played Dominion once, so I don't have a lot of comparisons to draw from.  Update:  my first multi-player game was fun and played a lot differently than solo.

A very forgettable deck builder. Not only are the pools of cards extremely limited, but with only four scenarios out of the box, there isn't a ton of replay value here. I like that each of the factions plays differently, but the game has more in common with a RTS than a deck builder. The game is fine for what it is, but I prefer my deck builders to have a wealth of different cards to mix and match, and Rune Age just doesn't have that going for it. It's on the long side, games tend to be pretty boring, and the number of currencies is a bit much. Basically, all the Fantasy Flight fiddlyness rolled up into a deck builder.

RATING: 8
Rune Age is okay.  The art is really good (as usual for FFG), but the gameplay seems quite limited.  I think by including four scenarios with competitive, cooperative and solo play in the box along with 4 distinct forces to play, they’ve perhaps actually crammed too much in, because there is not much deck building going on at all.  Or maybe we’ve been spoilt by Thunderstone/Resident Evil/Dominion.  The event cards as you progress through the game are a nice touch, but once you’ve seen them once the surprise quickly fades, because you will see those same events a lot.

This is only off a few solo runs though, so perhaps it will pick up a cool dynamic in multiplayer.  Not convinced yet though....


UPDATE 15/02/14

I'm convinced!

Okay, so here’s my current favourite strictly DBG (i.e. not Mage Knight) deck builder.
This is a hugely underrated gem of a game, with loads of different play styles which are all thoroughly fleshed out and enjoyable.  There’s a nice solo option, some great competitive scenarios, some which have direct conflict and plenty of attacking each other, some are more like competitive races, and then, especially with the expansion included – and you really do need the expansion if you get this game, for the extra units, variety and races – there are really cool cooperative scenarios too.

We decided on the competitive racing type for this session with two games of Monument, which we’d not played before (I won both sessions).  This is yet another great scenario, where you’re racing to build your civilisation’s great wonder or, er, Monument.  This is a great, really enjoyable game in any case.  Beautiful art, typical of FFG, set vaguely in the Runebound world, and with the random card load-outs and asymmetrical starting races, punishing event cards in all the scenarios, and the varying scenarios themselves, there is a ton of quality variety and replayability in this comparatively teeny tiny box.  The die roll when tackling events adds a really sweet element of tactical pressure – do I go and smite this dragon now with a potentially under-prepared force, or do I wait until I’ve got the firepower to tackle it and potentially risk my opponent getting there first?  There are also plenty of opportunities to sneakily steal your opponent’s cities and cause havoc with his deck too.  Actually notched this up a point in the rating because it plays so quickly and easily.  Definitely on a par with Resident Evil for best deck builder, probably even better than RE though.

This is by far my wife's favorite deck builder.  I really enjoy how each faction has their own set of cards to build from and a small number of common piles to pull from.  It is a nice change of pace as pretty much all of my other deck builders are common pile only.  Another solid showing by Fantasy Flight.

Play felt very similar to [i]Ascension[/i], except that each player has their own set of cards to draft as well as the central pool, and every round the game's bad guys smack each of the players.
We played the competitive game (be first to knock-off the evil dragon), but the co-op game looked good too (albeit pretty deadly!). I'm not sure about the range of interesting card combinations - I suspect [i]Ascension[/i] has the edge there - but Rune Age gets ticks for speed of play and greater interactivity (you can attack each other).

So far, I've not been that impressed. It seems very fiddly. You'd think after 3 plays you'd have the rules down, but there are still a bunch of questions that we have over various rules. I'm not sure if this is because the rule book is complex or is just missing some key information. 
There isn't a huge amount of deck building involved for a deck building game and the problem with the limited options for purchase is once you get your deck up and running, you might find that you've got lots of attack power and nothing out available to attack, or a bunch of gold that you don't want to spend because you don't need any more attack cards. 
I think I like the idea of it more than the actual game.

Build your deck, whack the monsters, whack the other players. I like how the game has different modes - first to beat the monster, co-op, elimination, peaceful - to suit your group and mood. I also like how each player has his own set of unique troops to build. There's only a limited number of neutral cards to buy in the centre though, so you'd expect most games to simply be a race for these to begin with, which feels one-dimensional (both in terms of the limited cards to buy and the fact that everyone feels compelled to go for them while they're available). Combat is quick, easy and fun, just playing out your cards to see who's got the best combat this turn, then everyone replenishes. There's no pain in losing an attack you've initiated, so they come thick and fast. Losing a defense means you're going to get hitpoints (20 and you're eliminated) or maybe lose a neutral card you've previously acquired. Suck it up and hope to draw better next time, or learn a lesson in how to build your deck better! There's exploration to be done across the modes, after which it's probably a bit same-y, especially compared to the variety on offer in other games in this niche.

RATING: 6
What I like:
- Love that there is a co-op scenario and the solo ability of 3 scenarios
- Each scenario plays quite differently, as does each faction
- Deck management with theme
- Seems to play smoothly

What I don't like:
- The "monument" scenario has more/nastier interaction than I was hoping
- The game seems to have odd ebbs and flows, and can seem to stall when all the neutrals are gone
- It seems possible for someone to fall into a hopeless state, as the rich get richer (Monument and Dragonlords)
- The elves feel hopelessly weak at first! (that does change with enough experience, although they still feel underpowered)
- There is not a lot of cooperating in the cooperative scenario
- Some of the abilities are worthless in co-op and solo
- The sharp edges of the cards are giving me paper cuts

The Cataclysm scenario solo is very tough.

The Dragonlords scenario solo is also tough. With more players, it seems to demand more pvp attacks than I was hoping for, but I'm not yet sure if it is "too much".

The Monument scenario was a big disappointment, because it requires a lot of cutthroat aggression. I was hoping for a Dominion-style almost-MPS game. Houserules (making more gold available and swapping out the card-stealing neutral) might fix it.

The Runewars (free-for-all) scenario is of no interest to me whatsoever.

I would put the weight around 2.3 (comparable to San Juan, and a bit above Dominion).

Rather fun. Can be a bit aggressive if you're attacking a player, but since there are 4 scenarios, you can play to whatever style you wish. You only have 3 different cards per scenario, but the real actions come based on the players, not the cards. Seems like there is a decent amount of replayability in the base game, but the expansion will add just that much more to it.

I can't wait to try out the other scenarios. I really do think this game has more legs than it lets on, but I think people are quick to judge based on only 3 different cards for each scenario. I feel like this game will grow on me the more I play it and I can't wait to eventually add in the expansion. I'm really excited to play this more and more.

Pretty decent deckbuilding game that is quite cheap. You will want to buy the expansion as well. The objective varies from being the first player to defeat some type of monster to last man standing to cooperative adventures. Unlike Thunderstone, players get to choose a particular race and recruit unique units from their barracks. Players may also siege opposing players' cities and steal them. So, a nice blend of variable abilities puts it above some of the other deckbuilders, and there are some interesting decisions to be made as a result.

Fairly awful. Turns are interminable, and for a DBG that's a cardinal sin. Three different types of currency, stupid PVP system, and unnecessarily convoluted card interactions all help bury this one. Worst DBG I have played, and in a field filled with mediocrity, that's saying something.

It's a filler. A nice take that closer for the end of a gaming night. 
One shouldn't compare this with the more heavy deckbuilding games. Actually I think the game suffers a lot from being thought of as a deck-building game rather than a quick and dirty card based fighting game with a deck building mechanic.

I really like the flavor, though, as balancing 3 different resources and the inherent self-synergy each race has makes for some entertaining strings of moves.

Honestly a little expensive for what you get-- should definitely have an expansion.

RATING: 6
A mediocre deck-builder.

Having 2-3 different resources to manipulate in order to purchase cards is interesting, and reasonably well-implemented. I just don't particularly feel that Rune Wars needed to be a deck-builder. 

The PvP is where this game really shines, but if I wanted to PvP in a deck builder, I'd play Puzzle Strike.

Also-- the campaigns feel really "bleh"-- one of them seems literally almost impossible. Like, legitimately unplaytested.

A fairly original deck-building game with some player-specific cards according to the player's faction that constrain the player's options.  Another unique feature is that the game comes with multiple scenarios (including one cooperative) which change the goal substantially.

While there is a lot to like here, I think the biggest problem is that the scenarios have pre-defined card setups which which mean that there is a relatively limited amount of variation in the game compared to other deck builders where the variation is achieved through the random collection of cards available.

I was pretty impressed with this game.  I love dominion, but feel it doesn't quite have enough interaction.  Rune Age notches up the interaction between players, but bringes down the replayability.  I'm looking forward to trying out expansions (if they are made) to see if this deckbuilder could become one of the greats.

Edit: The only problem I found with Rune Age is that I couldn't get into the theme of the game. I loved some of the mechanics, but in the end I had to let it go.

RATING: 6
We started playing this game much like Thunderstone- everyone working on their own objectives and not really interacting with the other players. It didn't take long to realize that this game is all about the cutthroat action. I'm sure I will rate it higher once we play the game correctly. The cooperative scenario interests me too.

RATING: 4
Rune age is ruined by poorly thought out card interactions and balancing issues that arise from too many needlessly random elements. In quests, the casualty dice' potential double kill and randomly drawn events will screw you in annoying ways. In PvP, the random player powers are unbalanced.

e.g. tap your power for +3 power during land grabs. When you win, and this power will quickly let a starting hand win, you automatically gain superior influence that you can immediately spend on expensive (read: better) NPCs and spells.

VS

that is, or you could draw the player power that taps and does 1 damage to your life bar to reveal 2 cards from the top of your deck, letting you keep 1 of them. This power would be good, except the opponent has already purchased half a deck's worth of super cards by the time it kicks in and is pounding you to death.

Totally, EFING, STUPID.

After played Elder Sign (IMO that is average and even cthulhu mythos theme didn't change it) I didn't expect that medium card game like RA can be as goog as it is. You can play it with non-gamer friends and they will be enjoyed it. Also you can play it with gamers and the won't be disappointed. It's good when you don't have much time for something bigger or when you don't have mood for something difficult.

This definitely has the feel of a Runebound-world game.  Although it's a deck building game, it feels closer to Thunderstone than Dominion: you are much more goal oriented here.

The card selection is relatively small, but replayability is helped somewhat by the different scenarios available.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Played Dragonlord scenario and Monument scenario.  The fractions are balanced and the event cards are well designed.  Both games were played by two players new to this game and both games were very close: the Dragonlord scenario was resolved when both players were almost eliminated; both monuments were built in the same last round and the winner was decided by strength counting.

I somehow worry about the replay value of this game because the setting up of each scenario is basically prescribed, without much random elements (unless you choose to use different neutral cards arbitrarily, or use a different set of cities, which does not make much difference anyway...).  I believe expansion is a must in the long run.

RATING: 5
This game has the potential to be good, but I feel it's just too limited. It's nice that the different factions all play differently, but there are only four card types in each faction, and only three neutral cards to choose from each game (aside from money.) Gave it an honest shot, but it's just not for me.

This is my favorite deckbuilder ever, if only for the sheer volume of options when it comes to playing it. With the expansion, you have 6 unique and interesting races, a large number of scenarios, and other randomizers that help keep each game fresh. Plus, I really enjoy the mecanic of having both a private and shared market for your cards.

Wow, this one is more utter filth from FFG. There themes in games are par none. But their gameplay for the vast majority of games may be solid but it's so stale and boring. Most of their games give me the following feeling. I feel like I am either reading a ton of text that does nothing for me in terms of gameplay or the mechanics are so boring that I feel like the entire game is a roll and move game. And there doesn't even have to be any die or have that mechanic present for me to feel that way. It's just mindless pretty pictures with lots of text. I'm sorry but there games are crap for the most part, they really are. This game embodies that feeling immensely for me.

Sort of Dominion with combat... Fun, and nice that it has 4 different scenarios (defeat a tough enemy to win, kill opponents to win, get rich enough to build a monument to win, and even a coop scenario where you must all survive until the event deck runs out to win). 4 different factions with their own units with special actions. So plenty of diverse gameplay. Quick game, rarely more than a half hour.

Rune Age is an asymmetrical, scenario based, deck building game where the victory conditions change from last man standing to cooperating for a shared victory.  Each game players will select a scenario, each scenario having an unique victory condition, an unique event deck, and a set of neutral cards.  Each player will also select a faction to play as; each faction's unit cards are unique, and only that faction may draft those cards.

Players spend their turns performing actions.  Players can spend their gold to draft their private units, or spend influence to draft neutral cards, gold cards, and to keep cards in their hand for the next turn.  Players can also play their cards for the actions printed on them, or they can engage in a combat action, spending strength, either against a neutral city (which awards influence per turn), another opponent or against a comment enemy drawn from the event deck.  When a player is done with his actions he must discard any remaining cards in his hand, unless he spent influence to keep them.  Once the last player ends his turn an event from the event deck occurs.  Play continues until the victory conditions on the objective card are met.

The asymmetry of Rune Age, while balanced, does force players to form their strategy based on the faction they are playing.  By employing 3 resources (gold, influence, and strength) the game forces players to weigh and judge how they want to play the scenario.  Gold is needed to draft more units, and units are needed for combat or influence, while influence is needed to manage your hand and purchase the neutral cards.  Tension is further added by the effect of the events in the event deck, each one commanding attention from the players.

The four scenarios are radically different in their objective and event decks, which give players an immediate breadth of choice with regards to the type of game they will play in any given session.  The main difference between scenarios is the level of player interaction, from virtually none, to an all out war of elimination.  Each scenario does dictate which neutral cards are available, which can make repeat plays of the same scenario seem rather static.  Nonetheless, the game feels dynamic and worth replaying as the combination of scenarios and factions add dimension to the game; however, this can work against the game in that some players may refuse to play a certain faction and/or scenario.

RATING: 6
Deck building with player interaction (and aggression) and a twist in the form of scenarios, which change the rules, the winning objective, available neutral cards for buying into your deck and generally affects the gameplay to the point of having essentially four separate games. Sounds good, but player races, which define what cards are available only to you, are not that well balanced, the card pool is to small and doesn't allow as much control over your deck as is needed in a game where you should adapt to other players' actions. Fun for a couple (or a couple dozen) of plays, but once you get the hang of each race, it becomes quite repetitive and random.

At first you say: "Yet another deckbuilding game; ok, let's give it a try just because it is Fantasy Flight Games, it is set in the Runebound universe and to see with what Corey comes out this time." Then, the beginning is so slow that you feel sad, cause you just think you bought another box to cover it with dust. Then, suddenly, the game heats up and you see yourself with your heart in your mouth calculating your odds, praying for a couple of luck twists and keeping an eye on the other players. Brilliant! The bad thing is that there are so few cards that probably this game will suffer from replay issues after a couple of plays. But hey, it is Fantasy Flight Games, you can expect for some expansions to give it some new life. If you want a deckbuilding game with direct confrontation, this is your pick, even before [i]Nightfall[/i], cause the gameplay is more engaging, the ends are more tense and the game is way cheaper.

This is a good game.  It has been a smash hit with my boys (12 and 10) and they want to play it alot.  It is light and plays reasonably quickly (45 mins to an hour) and has enough going on to keep things interesting.  There are more meaningful decisions that, say, Thunderstone, which was popular in the house for awhile.  The scenarios are nice and add some useful variety.  Everything works together nicely.

What I dislike most about deckbuilding is the entire arbitrariness of it: no you can only buy one thing, no you can only take 1 action, no you can only play 1 card. Rune Age is a breath of fresh air by not imposing these restrictions; instead, do all you want, and we'll balance the cards relative to that. It results in a more sandbox-y feel, and more subtle combos, with the possibility of combat feints.

I like that there are specific scenarios with tailored events/monsters, and the one-upping of each other actually feels like combat, with some non-trivial card timings and feints. Rune Age successfully dresses up the ugly skeleton of deckbuilding into a bona fide game. It's also an upgrade over the Sentinels of the Multiverse-like turn order and 'villain turn' because of PvP competition, so you can go trade in your copy of Sentinels now.

Played a few 2P games in different scenarios (Resurgence of the Dragonlords, The Monument and Cataclysm). With 4 unique factions to play and 4 different scenarios, this game [i]should[/i] have high replay value. However, after a couple of games, it was proven otherwise. While having a pool of cards unique to yourself is a great idea in theory, in execution, each player has a very small pool of cards to choose from. 

Once you've chosen a faction, you've locked yourself into the few preset combos and synergy of that faction. The scenarios and events don't really change things much -   the objectives may be different, but the method of achieving each objective feels similar. 

Replay value aside, this game has the potential to be a whole lot better. The game plays quickly, the battle system is solid, and I like how certain cards are permanently put into play to be exhausted for their effects. The expansion promises new units for each faction, which sounds like it could save the game from being scripted.

A decent little card-filler game.  There aren't as many units/cards as I would prefer, but the game still is fun.  Most of my plays have been solo, and I've yet to win either the Dragonlords or Cataclysm scenarios.  I think this game is still worth getting.

I like the mechanic of deck building. This has that. The art was very pretty, though I found I couldn't easily tell the state of things because of the colour palette. The relationship between the three resources was OK. It simply didn't feel interesting enough, new enough, or memorable enough to suggest anyone go out and buy it. If you have it, it will be some fun for at least ten games, though I fear it would stagnate beyond that. For me there are other games that explore this mechanic better.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Do not waste lines to describe the materials of the game, as good as ever, even if the damage counters are malstudiati: the font of the numbers is too dark and used the same shape and size to represent the damage of 1 and 5.

As for the setting, is yet another in the series of "Descent", and although the Fantasy Flight bothered to invent a background story, the recipe is always the same for every fantasy: the usual human who resist in spite of everything , the usual crazy demons who want to destroy without reason, the usual haughty elves-know-it-all and the usual undead megalomaniacs ...

Now let's focus on the gameplay.
This is quite serene: the variety is not the second name of the game, as each faction has only 4 cards each scenario and propose only three other neutral cards, but nevertheless, all the papers will demonstrate their potential, as they complement each other and avoid the specific imbalances that will lead us to the choice of essential umpteenth cards (well, after all, better seven types of paper, all useful, rather than a hundred papers of which only a dozen playable).
A credit is due in particular to the neutral cards, which differ depending on the scenario and study desk for the same and to adapt to all factions. An example: all the scenarios offer a neutral card that will force us to destroy his way out of the hand of cards, which could be to get rid of cards (such as the Ori 1) now good only for unnecessarily thicken your deck.
On the factions, however, you lose points: Humans and Undead are slightly unbalanced compared to Demons and Elves, because they have the ability to continually renew and manipulate their decks and their discard pile and I feel even judge Humans best of the Undead, since the former can literally draw repeatedly from the deck, the fact that we had the opportunity to see how important during the game.
From their Demons and Elves have excellent left cards. I quote respectively the Lord of Chaos and the Elven Knight: both with a good strike force and the ability to destroy enemy pieces free without constraints of any kind (such as "if a card is so, discard" and so on). An inexperienced player who controls them, however, run the risk of exasperated in front of the walls of small jockeys spewed by Humans and Undead.
All this without considering the scenarios themselves who, without disrupting the game, make it more attractive certain cards, or even entire factions than others (Demons and Undead, for example, are favored in the scenery of Monument because it would cost them only 10 Ori build one, compared with 11 Humans and 12 of the Elves).

Finally, the stacking of resources is made very well.

In conclusion, it is worth buying it? Depends: those who have been spoiled by games like "Dominion" or "Warhammer Invasion" (the latter, in the opinion of the undersigned, the best card game currently in circulation) can peacefully give up the game.
Those who chew just the sort will not be disappointed, especially for the fact that, in the end, the game is an end in itself, and need not fear the several tons of expansions of the aforementioned superstars. Even those who have "Rune Wars" but has little time to play can give a chance to his younger brother.

I am really impressed with how many ways to play there are and the depth of just a card game. When you are playing it almost feels like a board game which is just great. I haven't played it with more than 2 people or anything other than Cataclysm, but so far it has held my interest just with that co-op game type. I do wish that they balanced the units so there isn't always a clearly better way to build your deck though because of useless abilities for certain game types.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Interesting "deck builder" that is quite unique -- there isn't much of a "bank", and instead most of the focus is on combat and your exclusive asymmetric units. Result is that this is more of a combat game with very light, limited deck building that feels more like army/tech development -- essentially, RuneWars the card game.

I've only played competitive scenarios, no interest in Co-op or non-confrontational scenarios. At first I thought it was going to be like Ascension or Thunderstone, where the "combat" is really just an additional resource rather than a mechanism for true player engagement, reactionary play, or mind games. And it is, for a very small part of the early game, a resource, but after the beginning of the game it quickly turned into a resource used to directly attack the other players, not to pseudo-buy shit. And the player interaction, reactionary play, and mind games... are there!!

The different factions are pretty neat! But some of the cards seem to combo together so obviously that I'm not sure how many different strategies there actually are. How to play each faction seemed largely predetermined. So this becomes largely a tactical and political game... what do I attack with, and what do I save for defense? Should I stop buying money now? Who do I attack? etc.

One turn of combat can see a huge swing based on one player getting lucky (read: timely) draws and the other getting the opposite. That may remove a lot of potential depth from the game. That's true in most card games, but I think it is more so here. That said, there are some moderately effective options here to mitigate your bad luck by spending influence to save cards, etc.

Pretty dope! For a confrontational/competitive deck-builder I prefer Puzzle Strike 3rd Ed, as it feels much more tightly developed and refined. But as a combat-game with deck building elements, I heavily prefer this to its closest competitor, Nightfall, and I expect the co-op experience is an improvement over Sentinels of the Multiverse.

This game hits a sweet spot for us.  Quick and easy to play with 1, 2 or 3.  It's the only game my 8yo will play solo.  Not a brain burner, but each faction will play differently, and maximizing the cards and abilities will require some thought.  If you like Summoner Wars (we love), you will like this aspect of the game, though the mechanic is different of course.

The thing I don't like about deckbuilders is the big giant decks you eventually get and all that shuffling; this game encourages deck trimming.  I sometimes have only 7 or 8 cards in my deck at the end of the game. 

And we are big Terrinoth fans, so it's great to have that theme as the backdrop.

This seems like a good twist to the whole Dominion thing, but sadly, while having different factions is cool and all, after playing the humans for the first time, what am I going to discover from that small set of cards next time that I might have missed.  Nothing.  I really question the game's replayability.  Sure the scenarios will mix things up a bit, but there aren't that many of them, and they don't change how you play all that much (except for the coop).  The big issue here is that you buy what you want to buy and soon everything is stripped down so you just have to play your deck out over and over again, without the joy of manipulating it.  In the recommended first time Dragon scenario, we bought everything we wanted to buy and then  we ran through the deck over and over again in hopes that we could get the right hand to beat the big baddie.  Sadly, this went on for way too long, after a while we didn't care who won or not as long as someone finished the game.  Sadly, after rolling double skulls on every good hand we quit when my fifth attempt failed.

Of the other Fantasy Flight card games I've played, I am enjoying this the most.   A Game of Thrones LCG has become so bloated with complexity that it is like spaghetti code in a computer program loaded with unforseen, bad side effects.   The Lord of the Rings LCG is clunky, at best.  This game, Rune Age, is sleek, plays fast and does one of my favorite things, adds new dimension to a completely original game universe, rather than mooching off an existing literary license.   And the art on the cards is pretty nice, too.   I'm liking this one.

This is a really great deck building game for 2-4 players set in the same world as Runewars, Runebound and Descent. I really like the scenario idea and the way they change the play style. The possibility to attack your opponent's home realm is also a great addition :D

I actually think i prefer this to Dominion ;)

A light, fun, _quick_ deck-building game set in the Terrinoth (Runebound, Descent, etc.) universe.

The game includes 4 player races, each with their own deck of unique units (and each playing pretty differently from one another); and 4 scenarios (1 full coop, 1 free-for-all-last-man-standing, 1 a mix of the previous two, and 1 multi-player solitaire version with no direct interaction; it's possible for everyone to lose!). This being a FFG game, there are bound to be plenty of expansions for races/scenarios/units etc.

Some similarities to older deck builders:
- Like Thunderstone with the fantasy theme

- Like Nightfall, players have a personal pool from which to draft as well as a common pool (varying by scenario).  Each scenario also sets the pool of neutral cards available for play (plus some random city cards).

- Like Ascension, there are multiple currencies: use gold to buy units, which provide strength; use strength to conquer cities/strongholds, which provide influence; use influence to buy cards from the common pool (money, neutral unit and action cards). (Strength also useful in 
fighting Enemies from the event deck, or other players in the interactive scenarios). Also, no restriction on purchases -- buy as much as you want every turn!

- Like LotR the Card Game: scenario-driven, with the scenario setting the obstacles, goal, and the common pool of cards available for the game

Despite the similarities, there are also some very favorable differences:
- less bloated than Dominion
- faster than Thunderstone
- better player differentiation (races, personal card pools) than Nightfall (while much simpler to boot!)
- more planning than Ascension (nice to be able to pay influence to hold cards from turn to turn, and relatively stable pool of cards yore dealing with)
- nice change that the cheapest cards are often VERY useful
- I like the random event that occurs at the end of each round!

After 2 plays, it might be my favorite strict-deckbuilder yet! I wonder about the staying power/replayability of the base game, though: with only 4 scenarios, seems it might get old after you've played each of the races (although that is 16 games of play).

This is a deckbuilder set in the Terrinoth universe (the same setting as Descent and BattleLore).  In this deckbuilder each player is trying to accomplish the same goal, in my first game it was to defeat a powerful dragon.  There are three "currencies" in this game.  Gold, used to buy new units.  Influence, used to buy community cards.  And strength, arguably the most important, used to conquer locations that provide influence, battle event monsters, other players, and defeat the dragon to win the game.

Each player has their own personal units only they can purchase and there is a small stock of community cards that everyone can purchase as well.  Each turn an event happens that can be anything from an enemy players have to fight, to a new "reward monster" that can be claimed after defeating, to simply something that damages all players, or certain players unavoidably.  Players can attack each other to claim locations they've conquered or knock them out of the game entirely but the game is only won by completing the objective (defeating the dragon).

I like the high fantasy setting of Terrinoth.  It's like medieval fantasy but Fantasy Flight always depicts the setting with such bright and vibrant colors that it doesn't seem as bleak and dreary as most medieval fantasy.  As a deck builder this one is somewhat bland.  The standard formula is unchanged from most others, you just slowly improve your deck over a number of rounds but at the end instead of buying victory point cards you are defeating a dragon.  Which for all intents and purposes is the same as "buying" him for combat points  The only combat system in place is rolling a die that may remove 1 or 2 units from combat.  Instead of attacking the objective you can attack other players but that doesn't really help you win the game unless they look like they are on the verge of winning and you want to disrupt them.

I think the game is really lacking for options.  There are only 4 piles of community cards and each player has their own 4 different units.  This doesn't make games very variable and it can really suck when you're the one player at the table that didn't get one of a certain community card.

I do really like playing as different races with their own unique units though, and each one does seem balanced.  I also like the idea of having 3 different resources in the game but this doesn't work so well in practice.  By midway through the game all you want to be drawing is combat points.

There are so many good deckbuilders out there that this one just doesn't cut the mustard despite being a theme and setting I really like.

Damn, does this game kick your ass!  Rating may change with more plays, but as it is, I certainly like the game.  It's quick, devious, and difficult to win.

The only real problem I have with it is what everyone else mentions:  it really does need more expansions.  You could potentially see everything the game has to offer within the first 4 plays if you try all of the scenarios.  After that, it just becomes an exercise in building your deck appropriately and hoping you get a decent shuffle.  I could see this really putting a damper on the replay value, so for now it gets a cautious 7.  If it remains fun after a few more plays, though, I may even raise the rating.

Dominion meets Lord of the Rings the Living Card Game. 

A deck building game with four scenarios.

Two scenario's are to defeat the game. One is fully co-op the other is a first to beat it up. In both cases the game can win.

The other two are player vs player. One is a race to gather enough gold to build a monument. The other is a straight forward last man standing.

The two co-ops can be played solitaire as well. This is not a Geek variant either, the actually rules included with the game show you how.

A very fun scenario based fantasy game where the core mechanic is deckbuilding. The key thing to remember is that the core of the game is the scenarios, not the deckbuilding. The 4 factions are very different which adds a lot of flavor to the game. My only problem is that the elf faction is quite a bit weaker than the other 3. NOTE: the first expansion "Oath and Anvil" makes the core game even better and adds a huge amount of replay value. With the expansion, my rating of the core game would be 9.5

A deck-building game with a few twists, including cooperative, free-for-all and race-to-a-goal scenarios that set it a little apart from the others. Deck-building choice are more limited here, but there are four very different factions from which to choose. The event cards, sadly, were poorly executed and add unnecessary randomness and balance issues. Still, Rune Age is OK ... just not something I need in my collection, which already has Dominion, Thunderstone, Ascension, etc.

Incredibly versatile small deck-building card game. Fantasy theme set in FFG's Terrinoth is nice and game mechanics are easy to understand. Where the game really shines is the variety of scenarios and therefore game modes. You can play a regular PvP battles, you can race in a building game to finish your monument first or you can join in a cooperative play against evil. Overlooked lately but still better than many of other deckbuilders out there.

This game NEEDS expansions.  While the four scenarios are all decent the rather small size of the event decks for each could quickly result in the game feeling stale without adequate support from FFG.  

Still, the game is interesting and fun and works well with two players.

RATING: 9
Now here's a deckbuilding game with a new take on the genre and quite some flavor to it.

What makes the game unique are - as you could put it - the three different types of currency (Money, influence and strength) that nicely interrelate. Money gets you units (strength), units get you cities (influence) or rewards and influence gets you further strategical options or new units. Particularly interesting in that regard is the option to retain cards by spending influence. And of course the different powers of the Runewars factions allow a very different gameplay.   

The events take care of creating a very story-driven feel to the game. Will I go for an all-out attack on one of the neutral cities trying to get some more influence for further turns or do I withhold some of my units to prepare  
for one of the threats lurking in the event deck. (Resurgence of the Dragon Lords scenario)This whole consideration concerning attacking or defending skillfully creates the atmosphere of war in Terrinoth. And that's just solo plays so far. Another unique mechanism of the game are the two different types of attack. Battles and sieges (only against human opponents)Looking forward to try this!
Only reason I'm not rating it higher is that it seems hellishly difficult to win. Five games of the recommended start scenario in and I wasn't even close to victory though I could see the decks working better with each further session.  

Finally succeded! Game-Me 9:1 

----------------------------------------------------
Played it so very wrong. It's not much of a surprise it took me 10 games to even win one. I redrew up to 5 cards after the event phase only ...my oh my

Pretty good deckbuilder. It's not as good as some of the others out there, but might be worth a purchase if you're a fan of the Terrinoth setting. One of the biggest differences from other deckbuilders is that each faction has their own cards that they can buy, so instead of a big generic hodgepodge everyone has their own custom-built army. The downside is that this tends to make it sort of samey after a few plays. The multiple included scenarios play differently enough to mitigate this somewhat.

I like the different modes of game play, but mostly I just use it as a solo deckbuilder playing against an "AI" deck. It gives me the deck building fix with quick setup and small footprint and ok'ish play time. I do like the diversity of races and how different they are built. I don't care much for the PvP aspects in the cards, but it doesn't distract too much from the solo game, you just don't bother with those cards. I do wish there would be more solo-able scenarios, though.

Very pleasantly surprised with this game! Had no strong opinion of this game, other than, "That looks cool, I should try that."

And I dig it. I'm inclined to like all deck-builders, and this one is solid. Nice art, nice theme. I love the fact that the different factions have different play styles (though the people who had played before unanimously grumbled that the elves were frustrating to use). We played the pure co-op version, which will probably be the way I'll want to play this game most often. But I would still like to do the competitive mode.

I like the interactive play and tension of events constantly hammering down on the players. There are some great scenarios - I mainly play Dragonlords or Quest for Power - but it's not perfect. The balance of the factions is iffy - Elves seem to rarely ever win, while the spamming of Reanimates and Footmen can be a frustrating win - and worst a single unlucky turn can knock someone out. Someone attacks you while you just have gold? Too bad, you lose! Still, an overall fun experience.

Waited a year before I bought it, thought I didn’t want another deckbuilder but read some comments in a thread that changed my mind. This IS refreshingly different. 

I love the small deck and limited amount of cards, it makes the whole experience so much more ‘in depth’ and rewarding somehow. The decks play differently enough to provide some nice variety.

RATING: 7
I don't think this game gets as much respect as it deserves. It was glossed over because of the deck building deluge, but it has numerous innovations in the genre such as:
- Scenario play
- Direct competitive play (before Star Realms made it simple)
- Cooperative play
- Attrition die / wounding mechanism
- Individual "barracks" to buy from
- Individual races (asymmetry)

So much innovation, unfortunately the races all feel a little rigid in their early game plan. I have only played the cooperative format however, so maybe a few plays of the other scenarios will make it feel different.

Rune Age is an interesting take on deck building. It isn't about building the biggest deck, its about customizing the most efficient, stream-lined deck to focus on the specific mission. People might decry the lack of variability but think of the source material - armies do what they do with the tools they have on hand. That said, I wouldn't mind an expansion to mimic the new troops from the Rune Wars expansion!

The engine works fine, but the extremely limited card pool kills much of the replay value (having four scenarios is not nearly enough, as the tools to face them are mostly the same).
Luck has quite a role (not only drawing cards - and event cards in particular - but the die too).
I've also some doubts on balance (only partially excusable because of the asymmetry).
Overall, more promising than fulfilling (and less interesting than many other deck builders).

Love the idea of Terrinoth deck-building.  The many scenarios is a good idea, but it seems a bit limited.  I still need to experiment with some more free-form setups.

Innovative deck building game with 4 different scenarios.
All the factions are different (asymmetry in units and play style) and different game modes (cooperative, competitive, economy, one vs many).

Solo: Good, simple, solitaire, deck-building card game.
Co-op: Good deck-building card game although we got slaughtered despite misreading the very first enemy as just "every round" instead of "every turn". The co-op scenario was probably a bad choice for four newbies.

The game has some good replayability built into it, with the different scenarios and races that can add for most of the variety in repeated games.  It seems like the variety of choices on your turn aren't as good as other deck-building games, but the races add a lot of the choices into what you want to buy to add to your deck.  It also has a neat division over what you can use to buy certain cards, with strength, influence, and gold being the different currencies.  It's a clever idea that I'd like to try more, and with more than just me playing the game.  The Dragons scenario seems virtually impossible to win solitaire, at least when you're playing the Elves.  It has a nice flow, though the event cards (what I'm seeing as becoming the staple of any original FFG game) cause a great deal of frustration.

Imho, It's a poor deck-building game. Too hard in solitaire mode and even in cooperative mode due to a bad design. The game goes by too quickly, and you don't have enough resources to face the events. Moreover, the fact the events take place at the end of the round forces players to plan carefully the next movements and slows the game flow.

Surpassed Dominion as our favorite deck-building game. Another Cory Koneceiza hit from FF. Great balance of deck-building, conflict, and an excellent setting.

Rune Age is a unique deck-building game that centers around scenarios. The four different scenarios included in Rune Age present alternate win conditions for players, from an all-out war to determine the victor to a cooperative game experience where players all win or lose together. Scenarios not only dictate the win conditions, they also determine which card types will form the central card pools and which Event cards will form the Event deck. The Event deck contains thematic challenges, enemies, and happenings that are tied to the chosen scenario, creating a new play environment each turn.
\13\\13\
Gameplay in Rune Age centers around players working to develop their individual deck of cards. At the beginning of the game, each player begins with a small assortment of cards in their deck, drawing five cards each turn to carry out their actions. Each player's deck represents their faction's military strength and capabilities. These decks will be formed with their faction-specific Unit cards and a central collection of Neutral Unit cards, Tactics cards, and Gold cards.
\13\\13\
While players begin with limited cards in their deck, through cunning and strategic use of their available cards, players can expand their deck to create a destructive force of their own clever design. Will you create brutal deck of formidable Units? Or will you rely on Gold and Influence to acquire neutral forces and powerful Tactics?

An interesting take on the deck building genre, what makes this one unique is that each player drafts their deck from their own unique pool of cards. There are always a few common cards in the center of the table that everyone has access to, but by and large the private cards are what guides each player's strategy.

Game play is smooth and intuitive, but suffers from the smallish card pool. The game sets up with only three different neutral card stacks from which to draft and those three stacks are pulled from a set of only 12 or so different cards. I'm not sure why Rune Age was designed to setup with such a meager selection of cards, but it detracts from the experience, especially from the replayability standpoint. The box touts four different play modes including a co-op scenario, two different race to an achievement scenarios and a PvP death match scenario.

While that might sound like it a lot of variety in the game, in practice three of the four game modes are rather boring. The race to kill the boss scenario is great as a tutorial to teach the game's mechanics, but once you have been through the event deck once or twice and know what to expect, this set-up rapidly loses its appeal. The race to build a wonder scenario is terrible, as almost all of the interaction is taken out of the game leaving the players to taking turns fiddling with their decks. Co-op mode, much like the kill the boss training mode, is pretty good the first game or two and then quickly becomes dull and repetitive.

The only mode that really works well is the PvP scenario and clearly, this is what the game was designed to do. The unique abilities of each faction deck shine in the context of a free-for-all and the game truly feels like a quick, stripped down version of Rune Wars...which is precisely what I had initially expected out of it.

At any rate, I'm not sure if Fantasy Flight is going to expand it or not, but it would certainly be a missed opportunity for them if they didn't. This could be one of the best of the new generation of Dominion clones, if they can inject some life into the card pool. Right now there just isn't enough game here to hold my attention and it all just feels like a missed opportunity.

Quite a fun game but i feel it really needs more factions! game can get pretty dull fast once you play each faction a number of times. Majority of them plays similar no matter which scenario.. human footman draw / undead graveyard revive / elf neutral spam

played cooperative scenario (Cataclysm?) 3 times in a row - lost badly, but still had quite a bit of fun.  not so excited about competitive games in this format, but i like the idea of playing it solo.  might buy if in the right mood.
Update: ordered, received and sleeved :) Happy face!  Still not changing the rating though, as I'd still only play it when in the right mood.
Update again: rating it higher now :) fun game!
Update again: rating it a wee bit higher, because of the convenience of a low playing time.

Another deck builder. The base game has 4 races, each with it's own cards that can be bought to build your army. You capture cities to get influence points. Influence points are used to buy gold or warrior cards (yours or some available to everyone). There are several scenarios so the ultimate goal changes. There are also random events generated each full round which can be good or bad. Lots to like because it is different.

Offers more game play options through scenarios than other deck builders.  With expansion, players options are still very limited in deck construction.  Replay value is low.  Game takes up lot of table space.

Desperately needs an expansion.  I love the fact that there are different playstyles (pvp, co-op, race, mix) and the production quality is high.  Just fails to deliver in that it tries to be a mix of dominion & thunderstone while not having enough cards to back up the attempt.

Will re-review after expansion.

I am not usually a fan of deck builders. Yet this game won me over because of the solo option, and thematic armies that played differently, and the increased interaction among players. My favourite deck building game.

I enjoyed my first play of this game where three of us tackled the Resurgance of the Dragon Lord, but my second play with the Runewars scenario was horrible. The Rune Powers vary vastly in power, and the one that grants +3 to all Sieges to Cities simply rules the day. One player was able to steal all the Cities, and was therefore the only one to afford the special mercenary cards. It was not fun in any way.

My rating is tentative in that the game is definitely interesting, but I'm afraid that each scenario of the game can be solved, given the static nature of the cards available for purchase. Some factions will simply always beat others at certain scenarios, while losing at another, and then the game delves into the dreaded "bash the leader" territory which I despise.

For now I'm willing to explore it a little further. The game looks great, and is a fun idea. Hopefully the expansion will greatly improve on the base game.

There did not seem to be enough cards to buy with gold or influence.  This leads to inefficient turns or somebody basically shut out and no longer in competition.   Probably no worse than Thunderstone, but not as much fun as Nightfall.  We all got bored with our limited options.

Played all the scenarios a couple of times and the game just doesn't have enough going on.  Perhaps the expansion materials will fix that, but I wasn't willing to wait.  I suggest a pass in favor of other deck builders if that's your thing.

I think the only thing that makes this game disappointing to me is I had a preconceived notion of what it was going to be like and it was no where close to what I was thinking. My brain made up a better game I think. 

But with that said. The game plays well. But I felt more like I was just doing a lot of card trading and I felt a little detached from what was going on with the theme. To be fair, I have only played it through once, maybe I just wasn't in the mood for it.

Though I haven't decided on the rating, this game surely isn't for everyone. There is a high chance this will flop if played with a wrong crowd. It's at its best as a silly family/kids' dexterity game. Don't bother to play it with close-minded adults.

The tasks are quite simple for adults and thus the game probably is more rewarding for the children. In addition, the kids love the pretend play. 

I really like real time games and this is probably the one my daughter would most likely play with me. It's not that stressful although you'll have to hurry all the time. 

I highly recommend it for families (who aren't afraid of acting silly) but it's really risky as a party game.

My family wasn't terribly impressed. App didn't work the best. Doesn't work with the jolt or yelling, but that didn't bother me as much as when I hit that we saved the patient, it told me we failed. 

Not sure if this will ever hit the table again. Its too bad I was waiting for this price drop forever, and I am disappointed.

Everyone needs a good silly game for when the mood strikes (and/or the drinks are flowing). This isn't the one I would personally choose for my collection, but it certainly makes sense to me that it would be someone's.

This takes the "mini-game collection" idea behind Space Cadets and reduces it down to a bite-sized party game - much more fun and accessible, in my opinion (though I realize it's a weird comparison to make for two games with very different aims).

There's a few things that hold this game back from really being a must-have goofy goodtimes pick:

1. It is actually only 3 player. Yeah, you can have multiple teams of 2 or 3 but they never interact in any significant way so you only end up playing with two of your friends. Pretty weird design choice for a party game, I think.

2. Not all of the mini-games are equally fun (stitching is the clear winner). This is actually the least big deal of my complaints given that the real "game" is in doing it all under the clock, but of all games where you're forced to do something not-super-interesting on its own under a time limit this one has to have the most lulls in it.

3.  The way difficulty increases is just plain boring. The importance of a fun way to increase the difficulty level in a co-op game cannot be understated. It's absolutely vital for replayability, and this game just goes about it in the dullest way I can imagine. We beat the game on our first try on Normal and then realized the only thing that changes on harder difficulties is a decreased time limit and more interruptions - neither of which make the actual minigames more fun or interesting. Hard pass.

But big points for theme and just... sheer uniqueness of concept though. I desperately want to see more party games (and games generally!) that can boast the same. 

And props to the designers here - the [b]ONLY[/b] way to get me to actually enjoy "everybody has to do something ridiculous" rules revealed mid-game is to make the rest of your game equally ridiculous.

This is honestly one of the few times where I think an expansion could save the game. Not a great solution obviously, but worth noting.

This is not my type of game.  Real time, no decisions...pure reaction...chaotic...and very easy to win.   I think it is different enough that some folk will like it.  Younger kids may get a kick out of it.  The hairnets are kinda neat...though I have to admit, the thought of lice did bother me.  Luckily, this copy was new and we were the first to don the hairnets.  :)

The special events ("phone calls from your boss", I think?) were inventive and hilarious as annoying things for a game to interrupt you and make you do. The minigames those events interfered with, though-- i.e. "the real game"-- were beyond tedious. Every other Fraga game I've played was better, and his other new one, Captain Sonar, was an infinitely better "real-time team game where a high-prestige occupation is broken down to a bunch of tasks that don't sound fun on their own". Don't bother with this.

I don't care for cooperative games, yet Doctor Panic is so unusual that I really enjoy it. It's more atmospheric than anything else. It's a lot of fun for large groups, the interruptions add a lot of variety and laughs. In the end it's probably more of an activity than a game, but the wacky and unusual nature of Doctor Panic make it worth playing.

On first glance, it looked like the simple mini-games would be dull.  

After playing I realised that the games, tasks and components have been very well designed to get people talking, yelling, moving around, doing stupid things and laughing.

I wouldn't want to play all the time, but it works as an occasional  diversion.

This one is crazy, silly fun. Definitely one to play with kids and adults with the right mindset. It is 'embarrassing' to play and the puzzles are fairly light, so not for too serious a gamer!

This is mindless entertainment from the man that brought you Dancing Eggs.  I really enjoy this one!  I really like the combinations of the mini games in this and the events that get brought on by the app.

I wish the app was better and the heart restarts mattered.  The game is fun, but you cannot play it too often.  It is also really easy so need to add more tasks.  I think they needed to up some of the difficulty.

Surprisingly this was pretty fun. If treated as an experience that you play maybe a couple times a year this can be pretty fun. I don't see it as something to play over and over.

The CAT scan machine can be pretty frustrating and is out of line with the rest of the game. This is the one where you have to build a "house of cards" with two cardboard pieces, and then slide another card through it without knocking it down. We house rule that you can place one finger on top of the CAT scan cards in order to help it stand up. This nerfs it quite a bit, but it removes the one not-fun part of the game.

Great silly mini-game compliation that seems like a lot to remember, but every play people have understood everything and only had a couple minor questions.  Every play has then been followed up by "can we play again?"
Played with ages of teenagers and parents of teenagers and loved by all so far.

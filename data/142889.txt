Big on historical detail but small on gameplay. Unfortunately “ECA Dambusters” for me played like reading a graphic novel. Its rules approach in wanting to provide “programmed instruction” doesn’t work. This is a highly procedural and dice-based title, meaning you start the rules explaining the beginning and you finish at the end: not where you think the action is easiest to explain. In my opinion, with ECA’s rules starting at the end phase—the Attack—suggests the absence of a game leading up to. As far as I discovered giving it a whirl, ECA lacked any prolonged decision making in Planning, Flight or Attack (which is the order the campaign plays out). Still, its design intent is noble but other solo games, notably The Hunters, do it far better.

very good game here.  I'm not crazy about the map but, the mission does take place at night so it does carry the theme.

After scenarios 1 and 2. The mechanics of the final phase are not particularly exciting... great storytelling but no so many decisions... like to watch a movie. Not so thrilling to keep me engaged to proceed immediately to the complete set of rules. I hope one day to proceed further

RATING: 7
Good game , very clear and procedural, idéal for learning this operation, the rules are a very well descibed and high level - the game is not fun but to spend one hour to play a wargame, it is perfect .
But, it is to ramdom at each phase of the actions and it is very difficult to get a strategy BUT it reflects parfectly the "ambiance" of the real fight : 
you make a mission but 50% chance to die or not sucess to release UPKEEP !!!!

Unfortunately, this game is balanced more towards the simulation of an history that a game play with a chalenge for the player.
So it missed something to make the game fun, it is elegant, but it lacks because when the only thing to optimize your actions and to begin again your actions et roll again, it is not fun to over the procudural rules.

Can it be really called a wargame? I think it's more a "experience game".
I suggest not to bother too long with scenarios 1-9 as the campaign is the real game. This is where you have to make the most meaningful decisions. 
But unfortunately in my opinion there is not a very large latitude of sensible strategies.
On the positive side, even the campaign game does not take that long, and the game is very well developed and supported by the designer.
Different colored dice and color coded tables would have been a good idea to reduce "wristage". So for example you could have only one roll of 4 dice for dam defenses + water level.

RATING: 9
A true simulation.  This game has historical flavor coming out it's pores, and the research and simulation value is impeccable.  In addition, the presentation is absolutely flawless.  The charts and player aids are second to none, the scenario book is incredible, and there are varying layers of complexity to suit any gamer (from a single raid, to a series of raids, to an entire campaign including training of pilots and assignment of targets... absoluately incredible!).

The physical presentation is also quite nice, with an evocative night-time map, 1-inch counters for the aircraft, and, as mentioned previously, an incredible assortment of charts and play-aids.  This simulation (I hesitate to even call it a game... it's a true sim) is obviously a labor of love, and no detail was left unaccounted for.

Add to that a downloadable, step-by-step tutorial to step you through your first game, and this is pretty much a flawless sim.

The only thing that prevents it from being a 10 for me is the relative lack of decision-making.  It's an excellent sim, but that doesn't always make for an excellent gaming experience.  While I (GREATLY) appreciate it for it's simulation value, it doesn't hit the table as often as games that provide me with more decision-making gameplay.

I bought ECA after reading several reviews and glancing through the rules. I am not a wargamer by any serious means (enjoying a few of the lighter ones such as C&C, CoH, etc.) I was intrigued by the theme of the game first and foremost, the dambuster raids of 1943! Although the game is established as being somewhat complex, I was eased into it by reassurance that the training scenarios can get you to the full-game very smoothly. Also, the game is highly procedural, and decisions are added into the game piece-by-piece, with large parts initially being handled by dice rolls and chit pulling.  Of course, the game is largely about risk management and crossed fingers, which certainly played a big part in the actual raids! (Though obviously great skill and bravery filled out the rest.) I have played the suggested first-time scenario and Scenario 1, and I have so far enjoyed how everything came together. I do recognize with the first few scenarios, success is measured a lot on luck and logical decision-making.  Truth be told though, the debriefing chart is a unique perspective on "winning" and "losing", with such decisive words discarded and shades of success or failure come from the experience and the debriefing to finalize the story that the player created while playing.  I think this was a great design choice.  Instead of saying that I breached the dam, I can instead say that an unexpected victory was had, with awards given to the crew.  Hitler was made furious and air assets have been moved to the Ruhr due to the attack, removing assigned nightfighters from other strategic locations (to be bombed soon enough!)

I'm rating ECA with a tentative '8', hoping that the strong narrative and the depth of decisions integrated throughout all the scenarios outweigh its get-lucky procedural structure, which works fine while learning the game, but might hamper enjoyment in the long run if the decision options continue to feel limited.  It's probably impossible to rate this game fairly until playing the final scenario, as that is where the real game is (though there are many more rules to learn and practice sessions to go through before reaching that point).  But so far, I am still looking forward to my next several games. I can't think of any other game that I have that plays like ECA.  And that's a pretty big plus in my book.  This is a great achievement in simulation "experience" games.

Not for me - the flowchart nature of game progression and the absence of meaningful decision making in 9 of 10 scenarios bored me.

Revising my rating up to a 7 for now. Starting to "click" with this game. I can imagine myself enjoying it as the complexity builds in scenario 10. The chit pulling which i hated originally, I actually dont  mind at all now.

The rules are organised to allow you to play the heart of the game without reading the whole set. Having played the bomb-run you can then learn the rules that govern the flight to the target, and then the mission planning. 

This is a good idea, except for two things. 

First, the game feels as if it was developed in that order – here’s an idea for a game involving action over the target. OK, now we’ve got that scripted, how about adding something about getting to the target? Ah, and how about bolting on the planning? 

Second, the activation energy needed to learn the first and second parts of the mission is largely a function of how much enjoyment you get out of the third (or first, depending on how you look at it). If you don’t get enough out of the bomb run, you’ll never find out what the whole game offers. Fair enough, I suppose.

The outcomes of the procedural rule set are governed by the roll of dice. I never really feel in charge of the game, since my decisions are always local and tactical. It ends up as a scripted docudrama in which player choices lead to one or other paths in which the script is already written. In short, the design subordinates play to historical accuracy in a rather similar way to B-17 Queen of the Skies, but without much of the player involvement of the latter game.

Still, I enjoy the game enough to keep it on my shelf and pull it out to play again now and then.

RATING: 4
This may be good simulation but for me it fails in game department. Game is simply too random and decisions are not meaningful to me. 

Still it is better game than for example Hunters or B17,but not by wide margin. Campaign game is most interesting but I must admit that resolution of raids was pain for me. Once it was OK, but I cannot imagine trying to do it again. 

Still one can see that game was labour of love for designer and for this alone he should be praised.

RATING: 8
(Rating after one incomplete play of full campaign and several shorter scenarios)

I don't like solo games. The major reason is that I see them mostly as playing against the odds (which usually means dice) and that is not very interesting. So what is this one doing in my collection? I guess I just couldn't resist the theme. But then it turned out to be a really good game that requires a lot of non-trivial decisions! Of course in the end I am playing against the odds (dice or chits), but I have so many ways to influence the outcome that it does not really differ from rolling dice in two-player games.

Superb solitaire game. There are lots of decisions to be made and plenty of variety in the missions, with weather, crew skill upkeep values, etc.
The main campaign game is totally engrossing. It gives a brilliant narrative unlike many other games, and makes you want to write your own account of what happened in your missions.
Highly recommended. Component quality is excellent. Great subject, great game.

Very interesting solitaire simulation of Operation Chastise. It can be as long or short as you want, which is nice. The bombing runs are dynamic, and interesting (death star trench run etc) and you just have to have the sound track playing whilst you do the game. The replay value is there, but not massive for me. I am definitely looking forward to more game in this series though!

ECA is a very well done game. The rulebook was one of the best rulebooks I have ever read. Even though it is a long one it is broken up in three parts to where one could play scenarios to learn the sections then move on to next section. I liked how there were design notes, historical notes, and examples of play were on each page. In some rulebooks I will read a paragraph and scratch my head to figure out what is being said. I didn't find any sections like that in ECA's rulebook. Also Jerry White does a terrific job here on BGG to answer questions and give insights on design.
Players that don't like luck, repetitive actions, press your luck may not like this game.
If you enjoy games like RAF, B-17, Silent War you will like ECA. Excellent solitaire game and since it is a GMT game the components are first class.
Even when things are going bad like one of your planes crashing into Michelskopf (two in the same wing) the game is a hoot in discovering how bad things can get. ECA reminds me of A Series of Unfortunate Events book series.

Very thematic and narative game about a legendary raid.

The planning phase is a very innovative addition to a sim and the attack phases are thrilling and tense.

Is it a wargame ? I don t think so, but It is definitively a military simulation and a very fun game.

All the game is about risk management, a game for adventurers.

A must have for solitair gamers.

The rulebook is very procedural, but it does an outstanding job detailing every step of the game. Once on the table, use the player aids and only refer back to the rules as needed.

Very thematic design, rich with background. Just in the initial stages, but I'm enjoying exploring this game. (tentative rating for Attack/Part I only, most likely to go up with Flight/Part II and then Planning/Part III).

Unfortunately the rest of the game is too nebulous, I just can't wrap my mind around it. I hope to return to this one after I'm done exploring Doolittle's Raid.

I think this game is a brilliant piece of work and I wish I'd bought it earlier!  It does a great job handling the Operation on a number of different levels, from the careful planning to the second-by-second decisions of the raiders.  Tension and great narrative abound.

I don't know at this point whether this will be a timeless classic or something that I'll eventually lose interest in.  I am a touch concerned that so far I've generally managed to outperform the historical mission, which might mean that the challenge level isn't quite high enough to sustain my interest forever.  But few games in recent memory have grabbed me like this one.  Much respect.

[COLOR=#FFFFFF][BGCOLOR=#000000]1P[/BGCOLOR][/COLOR] Historical military simulation game where you fly Lancasters to bomb Ruhr Valley dams in late WW2. I really like the rulebook and scenario book. They are both thick (abound 48 pages each), but the game is very procedural and easy to follow. You'll do fine with just the player aids in no time.

As others have said, there are more process driven results than meaningful decisions, but there are enough of the latter to make you want to try again.  Rules and player aid layouts are outstanding.

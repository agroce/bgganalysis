Abstract:
A quite innovative euro game that mixes dice drafting (ala Troyes or Marco Polo) and tetris tile laying on your own player board (ala Bärenpark, A Feast for Odin). There are many opportunities to score points. Bad die roles can be mitigated. It has a lot of variety each game (special powers and tiles).
The players primarily interact by first-come-first-serve for tiles or dice. Moreover, the players compete for being first on two different tracks. No hidden information.

Thoughts:
At the core, Santa Maria plays easy (one simple action per turn), however, it is a very puzzly game (AP-prone): how to place the tetris tiles and how to use the dice on them in the most effective way? You have enough The different mechanics seem well-integrated and balanced.
I would like to test this game. The game is probably too puzzly for my taste, although I love dice drafting. My main problem is the graphics design, it is not bad, but I do not like the semi-comic style.

Santa Maria is a capably designed dice drafting euro.  The game is comprised of three rounds, and in each round, players take turns taking anywhere from 4 to 10 actions; they can choose to:  purchase a new tile to place on their player boards which will eventually give them extra actions in certain dice rows and columns and possibly gain them end game points based upon spatial orientation considerations, use one of their player rolls to execute all the actions for that row on their board,  use one the common dice to execute a column of actions on their board, or purchase a single action on their player board.  

The game includes common goals, resource conversion, engine building, and "race to get there first" elements.  In short, Santa Maria checks off a lot of good euro game boxes, and deserves a popular reception.

 Yet, as I experienced Santa Maria on first play, it felt like it needed just a little bit more TLC in the design.  One simple improvement to the gaming experience would have been to include a VP track.  Without that track, the end game scoring, which amounted for about 75% of everyone's score, became a strange exercise in collecting and making change, again and again, with tiny pink circles with barely legible numbers on the circles.  This is how we win?  Did anyone make any mistakes in the change?  Hard to say.  

The art was also just a tad bit underwhelming as I experienced it.  And the tiles felt like they needed a bit more umph in their graphic presentation and perhaps power.  Bottom line:  a good dice drafting euro with a few curious issues.

This game suprised me totally! Maybe because the art looks not inviting to me. But I am happy it looked inviting to my wife! Because now we have one of the best games so far from Essen 2018! Kennerspiel-weight and brilliantly designed! I love the use of dice and the puzzling in this one! Really good game!

Another dice drafting game (Theme this year at Essen?), but one that adds a spacial element to your player board.  The game mechanisms for interesting, but the pacing felt a little slow at 4 players.  Wondering if it will feel better at the smaller player counts?  One I want to try a few more times for sure, but am kind of wondering how many plays this one has in it before it starts to feel "samey".

RATING: 6.5
Rock solid euro design with many moving parts. There's a lot to process and the goal is always to squeeze out some extra actions to gain an advantage over your opponent(s). Everything seems to work very well and to be very well balanced.

I wouldn't play this with more than two, though due to the increased downtime. But what really annoys me about this game, are some graphic and game design choices: Why do we have to track our victory points with these extremely ugly happiness-tokens!? Why isn't there a simple victory point track as in millions of other euros? The artwork in general is very off-putting and will drastically reduce my plays of this despite its strenghts in many aspects - Nowadays it's just hard to get something like this to the table as there are so many other games combining great mechanics AND great artwork - Call me spoiled, but my gaming time is limited and I have a better half to convince ;) Trade agreed

Excellent game with just amount of input randomness to make decisions tough and tense without giving individual players a huge advantage for lucky rolls. Competition over the shipping contracts, landscape tiles, and conquistador track gets heated, and it's a very interesting puzzle to try and figure out how you can score something before another player does. 

I really dislike the theme (haven't we moved past this "colonization reenactment fantasy," people?!?!), but thankfully the gameplay is about as themeless as it gets.

2/25/18: One of the very good Euros from Essen in 2017.  Great mix of dice drafting,  action selection and poly-domino tile management,  with an eye towards engine building.  This from the same design team that created Mangrovia,  which was a very underrated game in itself.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I enjoy a good engine building game, and this one is a pretty unique title in the engine building vein. In Santa Maria, you focus on building up a board of abilities, with the catch that only one row/column can be activated at a time, and only if you manage to get a die matching that row/column. The abilities generally give you resources, or move you up tracks that give you various benefits, points, and resources for advancing along them.

It's very much a point salad game, as there are numerous ways to score. It's almost a bit Feld-ian in that it seems there are a whole bunch of mini games to engage in, and all of them score or benefit you in their own ways.

Overall, a tad more convoluted than I would prefer, in that it feels like a lot of things are there for game reasons, and for the sake of adding "more", rather than intuitive or thematic reasons, but I still enjoyed it quite a bit.

RATING: 7
Solid dice drafting game where players take dice from a common pool to activate columns of actions on their personal boards. The game comes with a wide variety of scoring opportunities like completing contracts, converting resources, and unlocking end-game bonuses. While the game is full of good mechanisms, I found the artwork a bit boring. I wish the color palette had popped a little more and made the game more inviting. I also found all of the end-game scoring to be a bit tedious with all the small chit conversions we had to do. While I liked the hidden scoring, I feel like the end game could have benefitted from a scoring track. Overall it's still a very good game that will please fans of dice drafting!

Very enjoyable first game. Maybe an 8 with additional play. It's a dice placement game where there are both shared dice and personal dice which get allocated to your personal board to activate all buildings in a given column (community dice) or row (personal dice). There's typical resource production and conversion, and goals to turn in various specified combinations of resources.

This game reminds me of [thing=182874][/thing] in that it's more fun in play than it sounds in description, and that fun comes from creatively squeezing out extra actions each turn. The basis of the game is using dice to activate a column/row to get resources, advance on the prayer/conquistador tracks, or ship goods. You buy extensions (additional action spaces) to add action spaces so when you activate that column/row, you squeeze out more actions. 

You compete with other players to grab shipping contracts and advance on the prayer/conquistador tracks. Contracts are huge. Not only will you get endgame VPs, but each "dock" on your player board will provide income for each ship there. Which shipping tiles you acquire will affect what type of income you want to build for yourself. Want to go heavy coins or conquistadors? You build it yourself.

So you build your own action farm on your player board and your own income. Player interaction is there most prominently in how you snipe contracts from each other and in placing your monk chits for bonus awards. You have to pay two coins to each other player who has a monk on a bonus space you want, so that race gets furious.

And the part that’s hard to describe here in writing but is the heart of the fun is how you can extend your turn through creative measures. You can pay to alter the dice so as to activate a different column/row, you can sell goods and use the cash to activate individual buildings, or you can take an action to free up a new die for yourself. The game gives you a surprising amount of leeway to get things done on your turn, and the payoff for your creativity is enjoyable.

A great dice drafting game combined with tile-laying. The graphical design has a few quirks, but I like the bright colors and overall presentation. It feels like a Feld point-salad game, it actually feels a lot like Pulsar 2849, which I've played recently as well.

I really liked the game and am looking forward to exploring more of it. I hope it will get wider distribution soon.

Santa Maria is ostensibly a dice drafting game, but even though dice drafting does happen they are so easily manipulated that the focus easily shifts to building your colony tableau in a way that allows thee most efficient processing of your limited actions. And even though I just called them "limited" those actions are easily extended by having enough extra resources to pay for extra turns. Which becomes more common the more the game advances, and to get more actions it becomes increasingly important to squeeze out that one extra resource you need to get another turn.

And while that puzzle may be somewhat interesting on its own it lacks interactivity, and watching others mull over their action potentials is definitely not the best use of gaming time. As I see it, Santa Maria snowballs a little too much for its own good.

Very good game of Dice Drafting and placement as private workers. I like the tile lying to build our colony, there are many ways to score (shipment, 3 public objectives, colonies)
We can easily change dice values using money so each move is each time a well balanced decision. I really like it. Only 3 turns so it could be quick to play (average 10 actions per player per turn).

Fantastic game, shame the art is caught in-between dull and cutesy. With a stronger art style and sense of thematic identity I would very much like to own this game.  It is like they were aware of the potentially provocative theme so made the art style more family friendly but were also aware that if they made it too cheery, then they would lose their primary market.  It must also be said that I am pretty sure it is not the artists fault, it seems to me more like a decision made to "play it safe". It is hard to support such artistic tepidness. Otherwise great game.

"Is that a prototype?" was one of the first things that got asked (and came to my mind aswell).

Everything the game offers is completely fine and the main part (building / puzzeling your player board) is actually very interesting, but also very exhausting. Well, depending on how you play, straight or not.

However, the game was lacking the most important part, fun! The game is fine, it really is, even though nothing great, but due to the downtime and lack of interaction, it suffers alot. Whatever you do doesn't add any sort of fun to the game, you just puzzle in your own world and that's it.

Feels very much like a cross between [thing=182874][/thing] and [thing=146816][/thing]. This is not a bad thing, as it makes for a very enjoyable, quick-playing medium-light puzzler. If you like those other two games, you will like this as well, but may decide you don't need it.

In Santa Maria you have a personal 6x6 board that defines the actions available to you in the game. On your turn you can purchase a tile to add to your board and increase your potential actions. Otherwise you can draft a die to activate all actions in a matching column or use a personal die to activate all actions in a matching row, play coins to activate a single action space, or retire for the round and take points. After three rounds, the game ends. Besides collecting resources, actions also allow you to purchase a shipping tile and advance along two tracks - a conquistador track that grants gold and points and a religious track that grants additional personal dice and monks who can be assigned to enhanced abilities, end game points, or resource grabs.

It all works smoothly and is an enjoyable play. It's about on par with Grand Austria Hotel in terms of depth, but might have fewer points of manipulation and a little less variety from play to play. Santa Maria is a game whose popularity I predict will remain high. The main criticism I have is that it doesn't feel particularly original and the cost of dice manipulation is too low (make the cost 2 instead of 1). Also, replayability may be limited.

2017-12-08 - 6 - It's an OK game with a cool mechanisms using dice. BUT. It lacks interesting player interaction (there is some, but not too much to think about - I took  something you wanted and you put your monk on that place where I need to pay more now to put mine). Theme is barely there and when it is this thin it starts to bother me. 
And Man, this game is ugly. Those pink faces on beige tiles with purple little backgrounds? Hard to look at, really.
You can make a cool little combo here from time to time, but you make it on your playerboard and no one really can see it and no one really cares for the details.
I had VERY high expectations on this game, because I wanted to get the second Automania (9/10 game for me) from the same designer, but sadly I didn't get it.
That being said it's an OK game, but I wanted it to be so much better.

Dice drafting and tile laying? This game is right up my alley, I always appreciate games that give the player many tough decision points in a pretty short play time. Using the drafted dice to activate columns of buildings in you tableau is a neat mechanism that incentivizes you to build up your board with better buildings and making potential chains.

The video's are raving about this game, and in this case believe the hype. I played it and can't stop thinking about it. It's like that really good sex you had when you were a teenager and everything flowed... This is among the best games I have ever played, period.
EDIT played 2 more times, and with 4 it takes about 3 hours, but those are well-spent, and there is almost no downtime. Except when everyone passed and 1 player has a few dice to place still. Often a sign that player is winning.
Also missed a few rules the first time, now almost everything is clear - except the order of placing the conquistadores back on the 0 field.
It playes good with 2, great with 3, great but long-ish with 4 (say: 2 1/2 hours)

FOUR PLAYS LATER: 8 -> 7

This one is slipping slightly. While the game is simple, there can be a fair bit of AP working through optimizing your options within the scope of what you think your opponents will do and what you need to do. This leads to downtime. I still enjoy the map construction puzzle and the dice manipulation aspect. However, after four plays, it does feel a bit "samey" even though there are different paths to points. I'm also not certain that all the powers are created equal which can be a concern if you play the advanced game - or perhaps I just don't see how to make some more valuable. The power that causes basic resources to cost only $2 is very strong - I abuse this power if available. I don't have an issue if it is available for everyone, but if only one person has it, then I have concerns.

I do wish the spots that don't have colonists didn't have roads - it confuses people new to the game about roads connecting back to the town hall. 

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Very solid first impression as I really enjoy the tile map build on individual boards combined with using dice to activate a column or row. Cleverly constructed with several different tracks towards gaining points. Specialization is likely encouraged to be in contention for winning. Dice are easily enough manipulated using money although money can be tight if you don't focus on having some flexibility/income in that area. Choosing when to pass can be critical for choosing end of era awards and potentially deciding who wins the different tracks, etc for end of era scoring or end of game scoring. The in game and end game tiles vary from game to game to create a different focus each and every game and the ship tiles can come out in any order. Everyone also starts with a unique starting power which is drafted along with a land tile starting with the last player in turn order to the first.

This one checks a lot of boxes for me!  I love the puzzle that it presents with the tile laying and activation of buildings.  Placing tiles in the right places is important.  The order in which you activate buildings is important.  The dice drafting is fun and I like the system where a die will cover up one building after the die is used to activate a row/column of buildings.  Lots of ways to get points.  Lots of actions to trigger.  This one feels a lot like a Kiezling game, with just a dash of Feld mixed in.  So good!!

I playtested this in several states. While this probably makes me biased, I have to say I enjoyed this more and more with every change and did not grow tired of it.

There are new twists on dice drafting and placement, as well as puzzle tile laying where the challenge is not a spatial one, but an action building one.

--It's personally, but I'm not a fan of the artwork. Especially the lack of functionality annoys me. Why not put the symbols you use on for instance the bishop-tiles also on the action fields itself, so you can easily detect you have those symbols in a line or row?
- Price/quality I'm not really convinced. Price is quite high for what will be half  a box of air after you've punched everything. If you compare this with what you get in Pulsar 2849, which was even cheaper, the balance seems to be slightly negative for this one.
-It's a descent game, but I don't understand the hype about it. The selling out hyped this a lot, but I really don't see why.
+ It's a good game, that will probably stay in the collection. But I'll rather call this a good re-implementation of things we've seen before, then a game that offers a completely new game mechanic.
++ There are in fact not that many rules to explain, but it does offer a good amount of interesting choices to make.
++ Every game other bishop- and monk-tiles and an other configuration of your board: replayability seems to be very good. 
++ There seems to be at least 3 ways you can pursue to win this game.

Fantastic game encompassing dice selection, resource collection and management, set collection, tile laying, engine building, and possibly a couple of other things! Multiple paths to victory which all seem well balanced. There is a LOT going on in this game yet it never bogs down and plays at a decent clip. And it's very nicely produced too. Wonderful game.

One of the best to come out of Essen. Super happy to have it. Game play is fun and you are doing action after action to try and get any number of points and resources to turn into point. The dice mechanic is awesome. Having lots of fun with this. Just wish the art was a bit more vibrant.

Santa Maria is a fantastic game where in each of three rounds you can buy a tile and add it to your player board, or spend money to activate one of your buildings on the tiles, or draft and place a die and then activate each building in the column that matches the pip value on the die drafted. Buildings you activated with money don't activate again, and the die used covers the last building activated so you have to plan your board layout carefully. Each player also gets a few dice that are unique to them that activate the row with matching pips. The game only goes three rounds but it is an intense three rounds. People always beat you to the die you want and to grabbing the tile you need because it has the building you want printed on it. There are other game features you have to consider as well such as valuable boat tiles that want specific resources delivered to them, and competing to be first on a track that generates points each round. The gameplay is tense throughout and no matter how good you might be doing you still feel like all your choices were probably bad. Even passing is tense, as when players pass they get to choose amongst a series of important bonus actions to resolve.

The component quality is not great. The boards are somewhat dull in color, and the components, even the nice wooden ones feel a bit thin. Oddly the resources in this game line up perfectly with the Stonemaier Games upgraded resource chests, so I'll be using those for future games. One troublesome thing is that the VP tokens have big smiling pink happy faces on them, which feels at odds with a conquistador theme, although that theme is super pasted on. Regardless, I highly recommend checking this game out.

:star: Clever or interesting mechanisms

A fairly competitive puzzle+dice drafting game.  Lots of different ways to score points and many little rules here and there.  The artwork is horrible though and handing out the happiness tokens is a pain.  Could be better if more streamlined but still a decent Euro.

After one game: Several strategies seem to lead to the end. Exciting optimization-concept and tricka mechanism with a great replayability. I don't like the graphic design. It says: Don't take me serious - I'm a funny game for little kids. That doesn't apply. And the iconograhic doesn't really helps, if you allready can recognize it. 
Nevertheless: The game is great.

Sad really. The whole thing works but there is no spark, no excitement. You plod through the turns, there is a lot of minmax at the end, and there is a touch too much like because of the dice driver. 

I like the core matrix but it is not good enough to carry all the baggage.

It seems like the designers put too much in, identikit style. A bit of this, a bit of that. Thematically, weak. Needs more development and downsizing. And a clever twist.

This game contains so many different things that we enjoy: dice drafting, tile placement, contracts, resource collection—it’s just wonderful. The game offers lots of different and wonderful decisions.

The production quality is great, the illustrations are really nice & sharp—and we especially love the smiley faces (though my partner things they’re maybe a little creepy).

Just ordered, after watching Rhado.  The game looks fun and challenging.  I like the Box art, and the idea of shipping and a missionary track.  I haven't played Puerto Rico, so the theme is new to my collection as is the dice drafting mechanism.

This game is a lot of fun! There's a lot to consider and learning can be a bit intimidating, but it plays very smoothly. It's a unique take on resource gathering/spending. My only minor gripe is that the shipping tiles have run out in every 4 player game, leaving us with resources we don't know what to do with. I think the sweet spot would be 3 players.

Recommend playing with the advanced rules from the start (blue dice in the common pool, players draft their starting scholar and manor tiles). 

Positives: nice turn angst with the dice drafting, the spatial puzzle is engaging.

Negatives: prone to AP, they should've added a LOT more scholar and monk tiles to increase replay value.

My first two games we actually missed the rule that you could change the value of a die by paying 1coin/pip. This rule saps almost all the tension out of the game, so we decided to house rule that you can change the value of a die for 2coins/pip, which after a few plays I have to say feels just right.

At the end of the day this is another disposable medium-weight Euro. The Voyages of Marco Polo does the whole dice drafting tension better and while I did enjoy the spatial challenge of placing tiles and activating spaces on your board I can see it getting old pretty quick, due to the lack of interplay variety. Now if they'd included a bunch more special ability (scholar) and endgame scoring (monk) tiles this might have been a keeper.

This game while looking kind of cute isn't simple.  It a great engine building dice drafting game that just asks "how efficient can you be this round?   "
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Colonizing player boards with tetrus terrain tiles where dice valued rows and columns determine round actions.  Very interesting planning puzzle and decisions between arranging the tiles, filling ship export contracts, and deciding where best to deploy monks for scholar, end game scoring objectives or advancing along the conquest track.  The row/column action mechanic is the heart of the game. It doesn't feel thematically tied but that is OK because the efficiency puzzle is engaging.  No way I play this with four people.  My guess is to be played correctly, turns need to be thoughtful which means AP and long player down times.  So it should be played with that in mind.

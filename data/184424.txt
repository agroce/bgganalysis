Based off of one play: Terrific Upgrade to Advanced Civ. Streamlined rules & great components.

The idea of playing at 12+ players is silly but worth trying for the experience. I'd only ever play it again with a normal 6 or 7 players.

1 game. 13 players.  Played with Babylonia, very hard position with other 5 neighbours! I play very well with commerce (almost all calamities pass to other player xD) but all the secondary effects are too much heavy!  
The old game better rewarded trade, which is the great pillar of the game!!!
Too much caos and I'm not understand how the game can be too much unbalanced. It's a pity for a remake of a great clasic game. Maybe is best to play with less player with no very clear weak position at the begining. And check rules of secondary effects!

 Wins Cartago and 2o Iberia with no problems and no attacks in all the 16h of gaming, and always with 9 cities.

I'm shocked don't see Francis Tresham and others in credits, by errors in game and for the price of the game! I played with my club's copy

Wow. This was more of an experience than just a board game. Sometimes it seemed that there was no structure in the game, while people were rambling around with their swaps and purchases. However, there is a structure, but the game flow is just different. I definitely enjoyed the game, and with some streamlining this could be something to play more frequently.

consider 8h for playing, consider you are NOT going to win since is you against 7 others at minimum. I love that idea of creating a "story", you build your civilization and then.. an hurricane storms your cities and you need to start from the beginning while your opponents take advantage on you

10/29/17: A really nice update to the classic game Civilization.  This game does a lot to smooth out the rough edges of the base game.  The game is still somewhat punishing to those going up the learning curve.  It's not fun to spend a full day getting pummeled in a game where you are behind on the learning curve.  It makes your first several plays of the game painful.  Probably the biggest downside is that you need to plan on a full day 9-12 hours.

The game components are very well made, other than typos on the technologies cards, and the game scales well.  I think that after playing this there is little chance that (Civ+adv. Civ + eastern map.) will see the light of day soon.

I'm coming around to the belief that your biggest focus should be buying cards to help mitigate calamities, and that what happens on the board isn't as important.  The endgame is a little anti-climatic, because at that point you are just buying a ton of cards for the points, who cares what they do.

Mega Civilization defies description of a game, but in a great way. This is a huge, bulking, behemoth of a civilization builder that takes 9-15 hours to play depending on player count.

I think the gameplay is fantastic. Trading is exciting and challenging, positioning your nation on the map is the same and adds diplomacy into the mix.

I really love playing this, and will play every chance I get. The sheer player and time requirements mean that I will probably get to play it very rarely, however. I admit that the sheer uniqueness of this game leads me to rate it perhaps a bit higher than the gameplay earns on its own.

I like civilization games - in their concepts at least - although they usually end up being too complex, take too much time and require too deep concentration for my tastes: such is Mega Civilization, a fine game that turned out too much of a brain burner. A gem for the lovers of the genre (and heavy gamers) though.

A massive improvement over Advanced Civilization. One play so far and with 51 civilization advances to consider I think there is a lot of room for different strategies. I tried a blue credit strategy that worked pretty well. The new calamities really shake things up and civilization advances that help with calamity relief or recovery are super helpful. The production values are gorgeous. I think it's time to sell my copy of Advanced Civilization.

RATING: 8
The MegaCiv AST does hurt a bit more than the one for Advanced Civ; the 5 point hit for failing to advance is significant. Significant, but not huge. If the choice is between taking the AST hit and trading in a half-completed set of trade cards, absolutely take the AST hit, especially early - while the first two hurdles are not difficult, this is a compound interest game and good advances and credits you rack up early cast a long shadow. Treat the early AST hurdles as suggestions. Although there is a lot more nuance here than there was in ACiv (where wise players ignored the AST almost entirely), the game is still won and lost by cashing in huge sets of trade cards, not by advancing on the AST. Do not break up potentially very valuable sets just to advance.
---
I think if I were being purely objective, and rating MegaCiv strictly on the merits, it would get a 7 - it is long, punishing, and early missteps or a brutal early calamity draw will eliminate you. The dizzying array of cards and punishing accounting aren't exactly fun for many people. But MegaCiv is unique and manages to turn Advanced Civ into a game that works and is fun to play. The 12+ Mega games are where this is at, and if you own this you want to try to play it once with 11 people you like (this is crucial). At lower player counts (5-7) MegaCiv is still manifestly inferior to the original, classic, Francis Tresham Civilization - but there's no accounting for a taste, and a lot of people actually prefer the overwrought, computer-game style of MegaCiv, and MegaCiv is definitely a decent game (which Advanced Civ was not). The 5-6p version of MegaCiv is totally playable and worthwhile and is actually probably a better - if less unique - game than the Mega versions (12+ players is crazily chaotic, probably beyond a reasonable point).
---
One other comment, it's actually super-weird how Mega Civilization has simply erased Advanced Civilization from the history of the game. The designers' notes talk about how they were such big fans of Francis Tresham's Civilization, but this is obviously not true - they are fans of *Advanced* Civilization, which Francis Tresham had nothing to do with and would never in his right mind have put his name on. Never are the designers of Advanced Civilization credited or mentioned anywhere in the game. Francis Tresham gets an "original design" credit, but Mega Civilization is built on the original design of the Advanced Civilization team, who are completely ignored. I assume this is for licensing/IP/legal reasons, but if so, why bother putting in all this misleading or outright fictitious text about the history of the game? Just leave well enough alone.

Played twice now, once with 6, once with 15. Have played many, many games of both classic and advanced civ.

Mega Civ is really two different games: a normal, if rather long, game (the game with 5-7 players, 8 if you feel lucky) and the event game (12+ players - for various reasons I don't really recommend playing with 8-11). The two games have a very different feel, at least to me. The large game was fun and a gaming experience unlike anything else but it's crazy random and very long.

The smaller games really show off the many ways that the game is vastly improved over Advanced Civ, particularly if you play the Eastern map which is quite tight. The new calamities in the 7-9 pile make a huge difference and go a long way towards fixing the most serious, and game-killing, balance problem of ACiv, namely the dominance of the 7-9 value commodities.

The major changes in the Civilization cards, as well as the many new cards, also offer a huge improvement over Advanced Civ. The re-costing of many cards makes for much better balance, and the overall increase in costs is also much-needed in light of the increased values of the commodities. The endgame (roughly the last 4 turns) is still a little wonky as the math gets complicated and you buy cards for the sole reason of scoring points, without any concern for whether the advantages are worthwhile or integrate with your portfolio. While the credit scheme is conceptually simpler and more rational than ACiv, it still adds up to a lot of credits which often don't make the game more interesting.

Like Advanced Civ, Mega Civ is pretty harshly punishing of newbies and it's hard to play in mixed company of experienced Civ players and newbies. While Civilization can be played competitively the first time out by most people as long as a few core concepts are properly explained, the bewildering complexity of ACiv, the harshness of the calamity environment, and the accelerating curve of credits and powers will leave inexperienced player with no hope of catching up after the halfway point (and can in fact wipe them out before the Late Bronze Age, before the game is a quarter done). It is what it is. Try to play the game once or twice at a smaller numbers of players (5-6) before jumping into an 12+ player game.

Last thing, if you're going to play this game in its "mega" format (12+ players), the game needs to have a reasonably assertive traffic cop to keep the pace up (or two in large groups, one for each board). This sucker is a monster and can take forever, but with just a bit of discipline you can get it done in 10-11 hours of playing time, even with the maximum number of players. This is not about hassling or harassing, just about encouraging and reminding people to keep the pace up. It's also about recognizing that some players who want to play this game probably shouldn't, and you, as the organizer, may have to make some calls there. Again, this is a huge, monster game, don't let someone in who you are going to regret.

---

Having actually played this sucker with 15 players now, I'll offer a few comments.

First, it's about as good as you could expect given that it's based on the Advanced Civ engine. Many of ACiv's worst failings have been fixed up or at least significantly mitigated. Not quite all of them, but a lot of them.

The trading phase is actually super-interesting, at least in theory. With 15 players and tons of different commodities, getting matches is some work. It's not unusual to go around the table looking for one commodity and find there are no deals to be had. You really have to adjust and work out series of trades.
---
Just a couple comments:

There is some confusion, Mega Civilization is based on the Advanced Civilization engine, not Francis Tresham's classic game (to which it bears only superficial resemblance). Advanced Civilization was designed by hack designer Bruce Harper (who also wrecked Third Reich), and is actually a quite horrificly bad game, especially by 2015 standards. But, Mega Civ has a made a number of substantial changes which seem to be in the right direction: rationalizing the AST, increasing card prices given the richer environment, and streamlining and improving the terrible scoring rules. I'm actually optimistic that the game system might be a lot better, although clearly still nowhere near the same league as the original.

You're still stuck with Advanced Civ's much worse trading and calamity rules, but, what can you do.

My personal project for this game is to retrofit it to Francis Tresham's classic, and still excellent even today, game. It shouldn't be too hard, and presents some interesting opportunities - possibly bringing in some of the new cards and calamities. But the AST will need to be constructed, and the play areas considered because of the somewhat different board. It'll be a project, but I doubt a super-difficult one.

A bloated re-issue of the classic game, with gorgeous components and a host of misprinted cards.  The core of the game is the trading mechanic that is rife with disasters from within and without, and is my main complaint: while the disaster effect is limited by game rules, you still are out the value of the commodity cards, and two or three turns with bad draws will end any chance of winning for you.  Even if you do navigate these well, with so many players there is a high probability you will have opponents who suffer from the "pick on the player with the highest AST" heuristic, oblivious to the actual state of the game, who will grind you into the ground while ignoring the true threats.  This is not so bad in a one- or two-hour game, but a six hour game is simply too long for this randomness and foolishness.

It took total 9 Civilization, Advanced Civilization and Mega Civilization games to realize that enough is enough - no more of those old school civilization games for me. Rating down from 7 to 4. Too repetitive, too long.

Pros:
The game looks much better then it's previous versions, mainly because of graphics design. Rules are also rewritten to (semi)modern format. Civilization advances, especially higher tier ones are different and give you also exiting abilities instead of just points/discounts.

Cons:
The game is still repetitive and gets dull after several hours of playing. Speaking of which - I wonder why designers didn't change that monotonous look and feel and released a game that takes 12+ hours in 2015? Unbelievable... Also, as far as I understand, playing with more then 9 players is totally pointless, because then you will basically play 2 separate games around one table because of different trade goods. So what you get is basically two games (Western civilization game and Eastern civilization game) in one box. Which is not bad eventually, but you should be aware of that.

Notes:

Mega Civilization is not going to be everyone's cup of tea. It requires planning and preparation, you have to be prepared to lose everything. Then there is the trade aspect of the game that is another game on its own. The trade is where you will get your advantages that will help you avoid some of the hurt that will be coming your way - and it will. Play this like a war game and you will lose, chose your fights wisely, if you not gaining from it - don't start a fight. Talk to your neighbour ...

As someone who has played Advanced Civilization a decent amount, I believe this to be a suitable redesign and worthy of consideration for people interested in having a playable copy of Advanced Civ.

This game will evoke many of the same things that are great about the original. I think, with a little work, you could even play with the original rules if one were so inclined...but after my one 9 player game, I do not think there were any changes I did not like and will continue to play with the new rule set moving forward!

The updates/changes to the rules are positive and come from a place of love...the designers seem to be massive fans of the original. As far as I could tell, all of the changes have been made to decrease complexity and the amount of time the game takes to play. 

The biggest change was the one I was the most apprehensive about - the civilization advances. While the tech tree of Advanced Civ feels clunky, after a few plays and a little bit of studying it is easy to internalize some optimal buying options. While there are many strategies most civs at the end of the game will be similar. This is far from the case with Mega Civ and something I didn't think I would like. 

It turns out, being able to customize your civ with the 51 advances was my favorite part of the new game. Eliminating pre requisites and allowing players to purchase very powerful game altering advances as soon as they could trade in a large set was really fun. It will take a little more time to figure out how to optimize but in the mean time, I'll have great time purchasing what I need to have fun in the game. My game was highlighted by the purchase of Fundamentalism and Universal Doctrine in the same turn I was hit by a 30 pt civil war and epidemic. I recovered in two turns and came in second overall! 

The mistakes on the cards, having to do with the credits, are unfortunate and while I did make player aids to avoid mistakes, I purchase many of the cards that had mistakes and still did not record my credits correctly. I will be sending an email to Pegasus about replacements. 

The box isn't as bad as some people said it was but, the hinges and clasp are not of great quality. 

I think something needs be said about the sheer amount of stuff you get. I am continually alarmed by how much of everything there is. I look at the extra components as being nice, mostly so that you can be flexible when planning a game day. Like, when I ask 15 people if they're interested in playing, I expect maybe a third will be interested. On the chance that everyone is in, I guess I'm covered. 

Will probably rate a ten barring tragedy during that first play.

Go Fish meets something about elementary choices with cardboard chits on a really big board - for about 25 times longer than it should actually take.

First game: 15 players.  I was so enamoured, I hunted down a copy even though I tied for third to last or something like that.

Second game: 17 players.  Beforehand, I studied the rules, and watched an excellent video tutorial series posted here.  I traded aggressively, made an ironclad alliance with a neighbor that had some bad luck early, early on, and actually played better comparatively than in the first game.  Result?  I came in second to last.

The first game was an experience: "Wow, I just played an 11 hour game with 15 people!"

The second game was a total waste of time, other than a.) meeting new folks, and seeing others I don't see often, and b.) making me realize I need to get my money back on this purchase.  For that realization, I am thankful and - if successful - will look at those 10 hours (thereabouts) as not wasted, but rather as a job where I got paid $25 an hour. 

If your game has "trading cliques" formed before the game even begins - and you're not a member of one - you're screwed.  My first game had one such clique at least.  The second had two, and actually there was another clique in both games formed by the game itself.

As for the clique formed by the game itself, Western players are trading exclusively Western, high value commodities, and vice versa for the Eastern players simply because those commodities are region-exclusive.  It was impossible to ignore that, in effect, there were two separate games being played at the same time: one to the West, and one to the East.

The trading cliques are the most frustrating. On the surface, it's just as it reads.  In practice, there is a core group of trading partners that have made an agreement ahead of time not to screw each other over (unless they can mitigate the danger in some way), and to actively help each other complete sets.  The cliques are so obvious, it's almost laughable - especially when most of the members absolutely refuse to trade with anyone outside the clique.  

It goes even farther than that. If one member of the clique is in a position to overtake another leader, or to otherwise go on to higher success, those players feed that player's entropy, and ensure that any boons gained trickle down so that every member of the clique is well represented in placement.

Who wants to play a game where half the people (whom you've just met once or twice) just shake their head "no" as you walk by, or won't even look you in the eye!?  Who wants to relive 10 hours of the worst moments of junior high school as an adult!?

When a member of a clique did approach me to trade, it was laughably obvious that the only reason was to get rid of a calamity. I actually took one of the offenders up on what I knew was going to be a horrible calamity trade, even sweetening the deal more than I had to just to show my good will.  The ice-cold blood in that player's veins didn't warm a bit.

All of this, of course, is legal and not even "immoral", but it is a great way to ensure folks won't be back to play again.  In effect, one gets the impression that some players are invited simply to be taken advantage of.  That's a fierce accusation, and I wouldn't go so far as to think that was done on purpose in my experience, but that is the simplistic, reactionary impression and that isn't a good thing at all for any game.

One other big issue with the game is that the vast majority of the people playing won't really have a clue about some key pieces of helpful knowledge about the game unless they own it (highly unlikely), or have played Advanced Civilization.  Kndec
I could go on, but I'll leave it at this: I think the game could be fun with a smaller group of people with no pre-formed cliques, intent on playing for themselves, and playing at a slower pace so that strategies could be more thoughtfully formed (the pressure to make decisions quickly in a large player game is enormous: other players are waiting on you, and you're holding up the entire game!)

The ultimate reality is this: I can't begin to list how much more I could have done with those 10 to 13 hours (with commute) per game which would have brought me much more enjoyment.  I could have played 'x' number of games 'y' times, spent time with my family, played a pen and paper RPG, gone to the theater, have breakfast, lunch, and supper out with friends... There are so many better games out there that play laughably quicker.  This ain't worth it.

Sold for a loss to Noble Knight.  Good riddance.

Wunderbar!

This is a dream come true. A rebirth of this wonderful game, with the mega expansion and western expansion map, in one box!

Although, the price is very high (well over 200$, not counting shipping). I hope that they can get a good deal somewhere to produce their game at a much lower price.

Wish I was living close to where these guys are so I could get one from them personaly, which would save the huge shipping costs.

This is of course not for casual gamers, but you do not need to play super complex games either to like this one. If you are well passed 7-wonders and Colon of Catane, then maybe this game will please you.

Note that you can set a time to finish the game (Bronze age, Iron age, etc.). It is a really nice game, hope this super complete version does not complexify the game for no reason (like Fantasy Flight did with Merchant of Venus).

I'm pretty torn on this one.

Let me start by saying two words, too loooooong.
I don't understand why they didn't change the playtime of 360-720! minutes. It's like reshooting a movie from the 70s and leaving all those incredible long scenes in there, being totally oblivious to the changed attention spans of todays viewers.

Playing this includes a huge ammount of planning. Finding 9-18 players that are willing and reliable enough to commit to 1-2 full days of playing the same game needs some nervs.
And after 4 hours of concentrated playing everyones mind will start to wander, especially when you've got to wait for your movement phase for a good 20 minutes. So people will start talking about pretty silly (usually nerd-related) stuff, often with the active player partaking in the conversation because his mind would like a break too.
So what i'm saying is, in order to enjoy this game you should enjoy spending 1-2 days in the same room with 9-18 nerds (usually men), that slowly loose their inhibitions due to lack of concentration.

One other major gripe i have with this game is.. whining.

In every game, EVERYONE! will whine at some point in the game. Even if you thought you're above it & totally realize this is just a game, and your only there for the ride, everyone will whine at some point about how it's totally unfair that so-and-so is targeting them while clearly some other player should be the victim of their aggression.
It's a bash the leader game, and because of the length many people will getting bashed. So prepare yourself for a lot of whining.

To the mechanics: They're pretty abstract and often won't make thematic sense. For example the trade cards, why are disasters traded with ressouce cards? Why is ressource set collection so efficient in generating technology points? Why is having less folks a huge advantage when it comes to movement order?
Because all of it makes sense game wise, but not thematic wise. So be aware that this game is a pretty abstract endeavour.

Is it fun? Yes for the first couple of hours it is. because especially in the beginning moves are going very quickly & the trade phase is actually a lot of fun, with everyone mingling through the room trying to fill their set or getting rid of their disasters.
But once the game is above 5 hours the turns grind down to a slog. And after 9 hours i couldn't have cared less about who was winning.

The mechanics definately point you in a certain direction, a military victory is impossible as you simply run out of city/troop counters. So winning is achieved by building all 9 cities, securing them and foremost trading most efficiently. I would have wished for a possible military victory but for a conquest you only get ressource card.

Oh i also should mention that the midgame is often just surviving all those calamaties rampaging through your empire.

it looks like a great game, but i'm unsure about giving catastrophies to your trade partner. a trade should be a win-win situation (of course i try to have the bigger advantage, but my partner gets a small advantage, too, and both feel satisfied). this is something different than a war, i have no problem to attack my opponents.

I've now played this beast of a game four times, and I have quite mixed feelings about it. On the one hand, the components are great, and the possibility to play up to 18 players is neat; however, it plays best (like Advanced Civilization) with 7-9 players, which makes getting it sort of redundant if you own that game already.

I won't probably turn down an opportunity to play MegaCiv, but I'd be even happier to play Advanced Civ, since I think that that's an overall better game.

This was surprisingly fun. The beginning part is a bit procedural but a nice kind of procedural. Then once you get into trading, it's almost entirely a trading game, which is made much more interesting by the calamities and the fact that you only have to specify two of the three things you're trading and have to trade in batches of at least three. And it seems like the various powers you can pick up from the pseudo tech tree can make for really interesting and unique experiences every time.

I can't say if it feels like it outstays its welcome unfortunately since in my one game we called it early due to time. Which brings up my major concern about the game, that seemingly the ideal experience is with 10+ players over the course of 12 hours. Now, I've played and enjoyed some six hour games, but 12 is a lot more than six.

This is a brilliant and thoughtful updating of the classic Advanced Civilization.  They have successfully kept everything wonderful about the original while streamlining the rules for faster play, adding a variety of new techs for richer strategies, and a doubling of the map to allow for larger or more varied games.  Advanced civ has always been unique with frenetic trading sessions and an enthralling ground game plus fun tech trees while the game keeps trying to pound you into the stone age.  Despite its age, it has very modern gameplay in which players are not eliminated and there is very little downtime as one is either plotting your moves or talking your neighbors into changing theirs.  The only drawback is it can be challenging to get so many players to commit to a full 12-hour play session (that may not quite bring you to the finish) but with resources like meetup.com it's quite doable.  I organized a 16-player session that was a blast and a couple smaller sessions.  To have fun, it is crucial to drill into everyone that This Is Not a Wargame until they can say it backwards and forwards.  The player that keeps all their pieces alive wins.  You grab territory only to the extent that it helps you keep more of your men alive.  Suffering huge losses in wars for territory is missing the point.  The best time to grab territory is opportunistically.  It's important to make this point because a player can ruin the game for their neighbors if they don't understand.

This one might advance to being a full 10, first one I've had in a long while. It really does seem to beat out almost all of the failures of the original game, along with adding a whole bunch of really interesting interactions. Once I've had a bit more time to explore the tech trees and assure myself that nothing's fundamentally broken or imbalanced there, I'll probably bump it up to a 10 :)

RATING: 8
Nowadays, this seems to be the go-to-version whenever one of these rare once-a-year (or once every five years in my case) instances of a Civilization game happens. It has the benefit of a flexible player count. With its ability to host up to 18 players, it reaches far into a territory that usually is only covered by party games. Playing the mega game certainly is an experience.

This experience could be hampered if a player is in it for winning and an unlucky streak of catastrophes eliminates him from contention early on. Some countries are more difficult to play and can be a losing proposition from the start depending on the neighbours' attitudes . Others peacefully sail to the end of time. Players need to be able to cope with this. Experienced reviewers claim that the effects of catastrophes and the board positions are far more balanced than in Advanced Civilization though.

An '8' is probably overrating it but only few games will be as memorable as one game of Mega Civilization.

This version of Civilization not only is very historically accurate, but the graphics and detail that have been put into this version are outstanding. The gameplay itself is very similar to the older Avalon Hill version of Civilization and Advanced Civilization albeit beefed up, but the artwork looks so good, not like the old version which looked like it had been designed by a graphic design dropout from the 80's (haha!). This game is the game of all games. Totally love it. And now 17 of my friends and family can all love it at the same time.

One of the best civ games, still. The rules set is a bit 80s but on the other hand not that overly complex and "overproduced" like many modern strategy games. Beware: This game is really not for small groups. It is no fun to play on a map for only 5 to 7 persons because everything is very limited - whole regions out of play, no real choice of nations. 8 or better 9 persons is perfect. The downtime can be a pain - like in all 80s games.

Fixes many AdvCiv problems without dumbing it down. I'll still rather go for the original Civ anytime with 4 or 5 players, maybe even 6 with an all experienced group. But with a large group this will probably fire ACiv on most occasions.

I might rate it even higher after a couple more plays, only one 12 player game so far, circa 10 hours including the a lunch and coffee break, so it does play considerably faster. Depending on the number of players the card luck factor seems to vary quite a bit, 8, 11, 14 and 18 players are probably the best counts ensuring a maximum number of resources for trade, so that no one will have "dead" trade rounds with no possibility of collecting sets.

I love civilization games but now Adv Civ and Mega Civ no longer holds my interest in comparison with mediumweight Civ games like Clash of Cultures, Throught The Ages, Nations, etc.   It comes down to my dislike or lack of interest in the trading phase, which is vital to game like Mega Civ or Adv Civ.  I don't have the patience for it any longer and I'd rather play Mare Nostrum or Mare Nostrum Empires for that pleasure of out-trading my opponents.

Huge box, amazing production values - the map, the cards, the tokens - everything is top-notch.

However, the game is consistently engaging, never boring, always challenging, each and every move and decision count.  The randomness of the Calamities and the highly interactive Trade sessions add much excitement to the game.  Easily among my top 10 games ever!!

This game is awesome in terms of size... and that's about it.  It has an area control aspect that does not require dice, but is still less innovative than Small World.  It has an engine building aspect that highly favors those already doing well and punishes those who aren't so that they can not catch up, creating a snowball effect worse than I have ever seen in any other game, which leaves you going through the motions of an already lost game FOR 10 OR MORE HOURS.  It has a bluffing/trading mechanic similar to, and less innovative then, Sheriff of Nottingham, and is more reliant on luck (if the person who has the goods of the set you are trying to complete has the worst calamity then you will most likely get that).  
And this is only the beginning to the flaws, the starting locations are not even close to balanced, it promotes beating up on the weakest players, the insane amount of luck when drawing cards, the insane amount of downtime for those that fell behind (usually due to a calamity or 4, and not the player's fault), and on and on.
Did I enjoy playing this? Sure, it was an awesome group of people and a decent game. Will I play this again? Almost certainly not, there are so many better ways to spend 14+ hours, especially if you are gaming.

No.  But if you think Advanced Civ is great, this becomes a must-have.  Maybe I need to be buried in the box when I stop pushing the chits around.

I see this through the eyes of someone who's played Advanced Civilization and I have to say that almost all of the changes are for the better.  This works surprisingly well with the minimum number of players (five) and the abundance of new development cards makes the players' factions less similar.  I spent 305 tokens from my treasury for this beast and I dare say it was worth it.

I can see why this game can be reflective to some player. This game is long, there's no denying it.
I have played with 7 players and it took us 9 hours (everyone was new except one guy that taught us the rules). I still prefer Through the Ages over this game but I would like to play this one from time to time.
P.S. I don't think I would like to play this game with full 18 player count... Maybe as once in a lifetime event but that would take whole weekend.

RATING: 10
Rifacimento del grandissimo Adv Civilization, il gioco Ã¨ capace di superarsi per via del suo ampliamento che permette di giocarci fino a 18 giocatori (!). Questa riedizione semplifica alcuni meccanismi complessi a cominciare dal calcolo del punteggio di fine partita rendendo il tutto piÃ¹ lineare e chiaro, aumenta perÃ² le carte tecnologia portandole a 51 e rendendo quindi addirittura piÃ¹ ampio il ventaglio strategico. Il gioco oltre ad una forte componente strategica necessitÃ  di un altrettanto importante aspetto diplomatico. Affascinante l'idea di giocare in 18 civiltÃ  anche se questo rende alcuni imperi realmente lontani tra di loro non offrendo interazione diretta. Inoltre con l'aumentare dei giocatori aumenta la lunghezza che rimane il punto debole del gioco. Ultimo aspetto negativo Ã¨ rappresentato dal prezzo anche se la scatola in legno e gli infiniti materiali giustificano in parte il costo.

(1 play, but more than a dozen of Adv. Civ.)
As a fan of the original Civilization and the Advanced Civilization expansion, I've been interested in this one for a long time.  However, given that I haven't found the time to play Adv Civ with a large enough group in nearly 20 years, an 18 player version wasn't really a good idea for purchase.  I got a chance to play this one with a group of 10 at FFGEC Dec 5 2015.  This version of the game lives up to its predecessor in every way.  It really is the same game, perfectly scaled up and amazingly produced.

It still takes all of a long day to play, but once you have players to buy into that, the experience is epic and fun.  In terms of interaction with fellow players, and building that civ story arc, it beats the video game (of which I am also a big fan, it's my favorite and most played video game).

In a 10 player game, we each came out of it with a story of the history of our civilization, and that's really what I want to get out of this game.

RATING: 7
A remake of Advanced Civilization. Very nicely done, beautiful board, chits and cards (especially the advancement cards). It certainly kept the epic nature and was able to add even more.
If you played the former, you know all the basics of this revision, with a minimal rule review I was able to dive right in. 
The changes are for the better.  In particular to the tech advancements, which to a new or an even an experienced player can be daunting. While the credit system is simpler you have wide variety of choices with multiple paths (not marked I might add), figuring out how to navigate is difficult. During the last few turns the math of figuring out how to buy multiple cards does get tedious. Understanding the tech tree relationships is the most challenging part for a new player.

The two AST look to split on either side of the previous versions track. The basic looks 
 
The trading system is still there, a nice additions for the large game is most commodities are split between sides encouraging excursions to the other side of the board. With more commodities your are forced to trade more and take chances frequently having to work with singles to get a beginning of a set then proceed from there. 

When you get to the 12+ players it is like having 2 games playing simultaneously with the other side of board appearing remote where you hear stories of distant conflicts and look forward to the traders come to time 

On the downside it is still a 12 to 16 hour game, and for that investment recognized you will be beaten down. I've never been able to really get the trading and purchasing to work for me and of course I'm a calamity magnet. However, that is ok but I'm not really in this type of game to win.

RATING: 9
This is one of the best boardgames I have played and those I have tried it out generally share the same opinion. It has many qualities - Very easy to learn, what you need to know to keep play going is generally in front of you on the Supply/Resources sheet, it has a clever built-in method to help out those that have been reduced to small nations of 1 to 2 cities and by the same means makes it difficult to maintain the large status of 7 to 9 cities. The Civ Advances are interesting and varied, there are no duds, and they are a simple and good venue for house rules for those that prefer that.

Mega Civ only has 2 drawbacks: A) It takes a LONG time to finish a single game, 12 hours is the minimum for a normal to fast paced game BUT it can be worked around by deciding to play shorter games, until Early Bronze age for example. B) It is difficult to find enough people (my age, I guess teens have more time) that can commit to 12+ hours.

In my experience, the game does not really become alive until there are 7+ players, although 5 & 6 work fine. It's a game of the more the merrier, basically.

These flaws may seem significant (OK, they are if you'r a practical player) but everything else about the game and the production is just outstanding! It can be played with 12 years and older, although the scheming in the Trade phase puts the older players at an advantage.

That said, I have only played a number of games with 5 to 6 people, a few with 8 to 7 and only one with 16 people so far and I've had the game for 2 months.

The fantastic thing about a huge game of 16 or so people is that playing on this huge board makes whatever is going on at the other end seem distant and you almost "hear stories" about distant wars as one would have done in the past, during trade phases when "the caravans come to town".

I gave it a 9, it may seem like a lot given that it is hard to play the game to its fullest (find enough people that have enough time), but I happen to merit the quality of the gameplay much higher. The prize of the game is fair considering what's in it. I love the wooden box!

No. 701. I Love Civ games. The one is very focused on micro management, trade, tech development and minimizing disaster outcome. Great Civ building feeling to it. Great game!

Can't wait to bring this one to the table.
Finally, a game that will use the mega-table installed in the Casa de'Tomas game room!!!
Update: three games in and it's even better than I'd hoped. So far, everyone that has played has wanted to play again!!!

Just over 16 months into owning this behemoth and it's already seen 6 plays. 14 players yesterday, and we're already planning the next two games. One 3 months from now and the other 3 1/2 months after that.

I cannot believe how much fun this game is. 
One of our local gamers played it for the first time Saturday and has already ordered his own copy!!!

Spel is compleet en alle tokens zijn uitgedrukt en per stam (16 stuks) opgeslagen in verschillende plastic zakjes. 

Ik ruil alleen binnen een straal van 50km van Almelo om verzending per post te voorkomen. Afhalen kan ook.

Als je onvoldoende spellen voor de ruil kunt aanbieden dan is bijbetaling mogelijk.

The only reason this is not a 10 for me is the time involved in playing and realistically getting together 6 people, let alone 18 which is more of a reflection on my adult life than anything else. Fantastic expansion/recreation of the game. I would love to be able to order a new Advances card set to expand all of the cards to 18 and correct the issues on the cards that are in the errata, minor issues at best.

This rating is based on one play with 12 players with some major rules overlooked. But we all enjoyed in this epic game so we are definitely going to repeat it sometime soon.
If you are in Zagreb, contact us so we could gahter even more players for next game (6.2.2016.)

My thoughts about the game? Well, it's amazing but very exhausting. Trading is really huge part of the gameplay, and very fun one. Advance cards are cool, but it takes really long to get the highest tier. Rulebook could have been written better but after one play you should catch everything without a problem.

A beautiful game. (I'm going to work hard to see if I can get an 18-player group together!)

Likes:
--Board is beautiful, as are the tokens, and the cards.
--It's a re-make of a gem of a game.

Dislikes:
--The rulebook had some rough spots, but a posted revision and Q&A here on BGG have cleared up the few fuzzy spots.
--The counters have burrs on the edges as opposed to at the corners, tarnishing a bit of their beauty: cut them out (and then corner clip them), and they'll shine.

Can't wait to roust up 17 friends to play it . . .

The game is very much like Civ. The trading phase is the same but with a lot more disasters (and more varying degrees of pain). The advances have been modified (more types, more copies of each -- enough for everyone, tweaked powers; a new credit system, sort of, to buy techs). Of course, the map is much MUCH bigger, with many more nations. I'm sure there are other changes that I just don't remember.

It was a fun game but ultimately not for me. While I still enjoy the basic game system, especially the trading phase, and I still would like to try Advanced Civ, I don't think it gets any better for having 18 people in it! A game of this length is not likely to get more than a few plays a decade ... not worth the trouble of doing the big version!

This game takes 5 hours for the buildup. This requires patience which most gamers nowaday don't longer have: think of all those other great games you could have played in the meantime! As a result, after 5 hours in on a 10 person showing, 4 guys just dropped out on virtue of 'not interested anymore'.

Big letdown as you could feel the engine finally getting some steam and intricacies evolve. 

However, was already extremely difficult to get to the table, will be virtually impossible now. 

With pain in my heart: for trade.

This game is epic.  Just played a 10 player game.  One of my guests, a ten year old, said "I do not like this game.  I LOVE THIS GAME!"  Can't wait to play again.  I was a huge fan of Civilization and Advanced Civilization, and this game is a great reimplementation.  Thanks to the designers!

The battle system is simple but great, the techs are giving an advantage, but not a huge one. 
The problems are the downtime (classic round based) and the, i think, unbalanced natural disasters.
Because of the down I wouldnt play it with more than 7 players.

I currently give it a 9 after one 6P game. (I have a lot of experience playing Advanced Civ)
If the game manages to pull of the same pleasure in a 15+ player game, which I have scheduled around christmas, without increased downtimes it will receive a 10.

Had the chance to play with 18 people, including one of the designers, at the Plaid Hat offices, streamed on twitch for charity. The game lasted an epic 19 hours and it was a blast. The best--and hardest--part is trading for what you need. The amount of bald-faced lying involved is impressive. But it takes a lot out of you, and I can't say I would want to play more than once a year. But man, it was quite a gaming experience.  I highly recommend this if you can get a good group together.

Arranged three games so far and this is without a doubt the "one" game I never will turn down. It's amazing how up to 18 players can play at the same time without any real issues with downtime and how such an easy solution to conlict can create such depth. Truly a masterpiece!

Just amazing!  I love the fact that war against nations are optional. War is costly and nations waging wars often tend to ruin each other and making way for players using clever negotiations, science and balanced agreements with their neighbors to becoming the winners. This one is a 10 with experienced players.

[gameid=177] is one of my favorite games.  I'm not sure this is an improvement so much as a lateral move, but it's definitely still worth a 10 rating.

The old good stuff is still there, from the easily-learned system, to fascinating trade system and a wonderfully immersive subgame on the map that is just complex enough to hold attention without being overwhelming.  There are lots of small things fixed or cleaned up, like ships being easier to deal with, and Civil War being in one of the higher decks.  The components are better than the old version, and having a bigger board and more playable area is definitely appealing, even if playing with all 18 players may never happen for me.  The map is a little tighter, which is a nice touch and makes a few more of the space technologies (like Agriculture!) absolutely critical for some civilizations.  I have my quibbles with what they didn't change (Civil War should be even less harsh or in a higher deck, and a little bit more bash the leader effects would have been nice), but I agree with almost all of the changes.

The biggest difference is the tech system, which has gotten a complete overhaul.  The credits have been streamlined, and a lot of rebalancing has been done.  I'm not entirely certain the plethora of choices is all good.  It makes the calamity-mitigation techs weaker, since they don't mitigate enough and they're no longer required buys later in the game since you now have other credit choices.  The new tech system encourages you to focus in one particular area, but I'm not sure that's actually all that interesting.  The Advanced AST mitigates this to some degree, but you want to have an experienced group to pull that off, something that's difficult to do with a game of this length.

But on balance, this is a wonderful reprint.  Definitely worth playing.

This game puts me in a conundrum. On one hand it is a game that I haven't played, and probably never will, at least with its full complement of players, where I have no doubt that it really shines. On the other hand, I am giddy like a schoolchild whenever I open the enormous wooden box and sift through the bonanza of cardboard and cards that is inside. AND "Civilization" may be one of the best board games in the history of forever. So I will just rate it the same as the original, and leave it at this... at least for the time being.

A reboot of the Avalon Hill classic Advanced Civilization. 

This version plays up to eighteen people, which is slightly ridiculous as it takes 12-14 hours to do so. Still, it is playable at a more manageable level of 4-8 and I have to say, everything about this updated version is for the better. Beautiful tech cards, simple and smooth gameplay and a gigantic map that makes everything easy to see at a glance.

I was pleasantly surprised at how smoothly the game played out, considering the scope. Everything is quite easy to resolve and the bulk of the game takes place in a trading round, which is every bit as loud and exciting as an actual marketplace.

The game's calamity system, which acts as a series of disastrous hurdles for your civilization to overcome, makes for some tense, engaging tactical play as you try to mitigate or recover from the devastating shots the other players (or the game itself) throws at you. It's a simple system, but it makes every turn a constant struggle for survival, which feels appropriate for a civilization simulation.

All in all, this does feel a bit dated compared to other civilization games out there like Clash of Cultures and Through the Ages, but even so, it does things just differently enough to be interesting. In  particular, the achievement system that marks off the historical ages of the civilizations is fantastic. It's little more than a filter to separate the successful civilizations from the failing ones, but it adds a lot of tension knowing you are on a timer.

I have played the full 18 player game once, and it was a blast. Not something I'd want to do more than a couple times a year, as it was quite an endurance test. Still the game plays well at more reasonable player counts and having that option to go stupidly big, well, that's just awesome.

Expand your population across the map and build cities.  Harvest trade resources from your cities and trade with other players to collect sets.  Trade sets in to acquire advancements that provide special advantages.  So far, so simple... except this is played on a seven foot map with up to 18 players and the game takes 10-12 hours, which provides a fairly epic gameplay experience.

Played a 9 player game the other weekend and due to a variety of reasons it went from 9:30am to 1:30am the following day. But we had a blast. 

I dislike the way you handle a player leaving as depending on where that player was -- ours was in Rome -- it means that part of the board is cut off and in our case 3 of the players were unfairly disadvantaged because they were cut off form one another and had no way to easily get to the rest of the board. 

Post game agreement was that if someone leaves it'd be better to make each city of the departed player a Pirate city and then all his remaining units become barbarian. The "Out of Play" markers are bogus.

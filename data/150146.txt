Rattlebones intrigued me for some time due to its being the first true "dice building game" where you actually alter the sides of your dice over the course of the game.  When I found it on sale, I decided to pick up a copy.

It should be said up front that Rattlebones is a light game.  It has a relatively simple rule set and the game plays quickly, both in total game time and in turn length.  Turns can take only a few seconds, though more often they'll play out in a minute or so.  This being a dice game, their is a fairly heavy helping of luck involved.  Strategy is important, but the winner will not always be the player with the best strategy.

Despite knowing this was a light game when I bought it, I still came away a bit disappointed initially.  I just feel like the designer could have done so much more with the concept.  I would have liked to see players rolling more of their dice more frequently, which would have reduced the luck factor a bit.  The die face that allows the player to reroll the die and add another die seems much stronger than the other die-adding ability, the coin, which basically just transfers a die from one turn to the next.  The reroll ability seems to be a must have to be successful in the game.  I would have preferred that all players always roll all of their dice and for the dice abilities to allow more comboing of abilities to create interesting plays, much like a in deck building game.

In the end, Rattlebones is decent for its novelty factor, and I'll probably bring it out on occasion, particularly with non-gamers, but I can't help but think of how much more could have been done with the concept.

A roll and move I will play. The twist here is that you roll one to three dice based on resources you spend each round then depending on which space you land on you get to decide if you want to replace one of the faces on one of your dice to the action on said space. This allows you to program dice into mini custom action engines.  As the game progresses you are able to reduce the randomness and Increase the probability of executing specific strategies based on the actions you have programmed your dice to perform. I like it.

RATING: 5.5
For its components - namely, the changeable die faces - this game is unique.  But it is more of an experience than a game.  The theme is random, but the production does its best to have the theme work throughout the components.  At its heart, it is a die rolling exercise.  But it is not a push-your-luck game.  You roll a die and (if lucky and even possible), you might get to roll additional dice.  Generally its a 1 die roll and some effect from it.  There are player choices to be made - some smart thinking (and hoping) will position a player for a better outcome.  In the end though you are rolling dice to see you gets the better result(s) more often.  That's why the game is more experience.  Changing the dice to be something different is... well... different and as such noteworthy.

RATING: 5
Rattlebones has a great concept, because adapting your dice as the game progresses is very interesting and it leads to real questions about how many sides with pips you can afford to give up. The game went a bit long when we played it, but I think that relates to the fact that we were inexperienced and didn't know which die faces we should concentrate on. There does seem to be one flaw in the game, and any time we're actually discussing after the game how to fix it I worry that it might be a pretty significant flaw. The coins are way too weak, they really have no value when the re-roll sides of the dice are available. By taking the coin side of your die you're basically risking losing a turn every time you roll that die in hopes that you can build a bigger turn in the future. I'm sure with the right combo (perhaps the x2) it might start paying off benefits, but you'd have to be pretty fortunate to make that an effective strategy. It's actually to the point where I'm planning on looking in the Variants forum here for other ways of using the coins that might make them actually worthwhile. But despite the difficulty with that one aspect, we still had a good time and thought the game was worth trying again.

WOW this one really surprised me. A Dice engine building game using the face of the dice. Kids love it, wife (Not a gamer) loves it. I have really enjoyed it.

The dice building mechanism is cool and new
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A really neat engine building type game, where you start the game with 3 standard D6, and swap out the faces during the game to slowly turn your dice into point scoring machines.

On your turn, just roll a die (and possibly more if you have gold to spend).  If you roll pips, move one of your pawns that many pips, and swap a new face onto that die depending on the space you landed on.  The new faces contain various symbols that allow you to do various things.  If you roll a symbol, take the action for that symbol.  Symbols can score you points in various ways, allow you to roll more dice, etc.

So, the goal of the game is to build your dice into something that allows you to outscore the other players.

Most of the fun is really the gimmick of being able to alter your dice, but the underlying game is pretty neat.  It's also fairly simple so that anyone could play.

RATING: 8
We thought it was similar to games like Quarriors -- where you are trying to get more and more powerful dice. The game goes by pretty quickly, so it's a nice easy one. Could be played by younger kids. But there is some strategy. And lots of little tiny pieces popping all over the place if you're not careful. The first time we played we ended up within one point of each other. It might have been nice if the game makers were able to give you a little compartment for all those pieces. But we found that if we keep it in one bag it isn't too hard to dig out the one that you're looking for. Have everyone reset the dice at the end of the game. Makes it much easier to start playing next time. The only thing that gets confusing is remembering that when you land on a space all you get is the dice piece, not the actual reward pictured. I think the graphics could have fixed that. So that is the only thing we kept screwing up. Plus, remember not to get rid of all your pips. Because it makes it really hard to move around the board if you do that. ;) #lessonslearned

The element of building your own dice by replacing the die faces is ingenious.  I just wish that this mechanic was in a better game.  The artwork is attractive, the dice are cool, but there just aren't many meaningful decisions to make.

The idea of changing the face of your dice is compelling.  I like the name Rattlebones and how Mr Rattlebones moves.  I like the train and the light whimsical nature of the theme.  But I am not a big fan of how it all works together.  I have a few simple wishes: I wish I could roll all three dice at the same time, I wish there was less downtime (removing and adding the dice faces takes time), and I wish the decisions seemed to have a deeper impact on game play (though take that last point with a grain of salt since I've only played it once).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Rattlebones has a pretty unique game play to me.  It is a dice game that you can change your dice during play by changing the pips into different actions.  Each game changes due to randomness of cards being played on the board.  I would suggest some sort of organizer for the pip replacement to save time finding the correct pieces while you play.

SUCH a good idea, lackluster execution.

The idea: Using die-faces as deckbuilding elements means (a) no trashing; you always have exactly the same number of 'cards' in your 'deck', and (b) you have three small 'decks' and can choose the right one to 'draw' from.

The execution problems: The tableau of available stuff for a given game isn't that varied, and you spend about 30% of your time just counting spaces on the movement track.

RATING: 8
There is really no other game quite like this. It's got a great "creepy carnival" vibe, variable board setup, and completely unique components. Those dice. Wow. You actually pop the sides off of them and replace them with other sides. I guess this is deckbuilding. Sort of. But what a delightful twist. And there is strategy, oh yes. Knowing the interactions that can come up in the setup, knowing which sides of your dice to upgrade (and how many is too many), figuring out how to score points, monitoring the value of the 1234 and Train pieces as they fluctuate throughout the game in value. Yikes. But that's not to say you can't just add sides and hope for the best. First time players can absolutely win. So no, it's not best played in a highly-competitive tournament setting. But it is a great experience, win or lose, watching your dice transform from pointless piece-movers into powerful point-picker-uppers.

After my first playing of Rattlebones, I was teeming to buy it, and quickly made an Amazon order when I got home. The amount of parts, options and sheer process involved seem daunting at first. But once our group got moving, and started (literally) assembling a strategy, the word "intriguing" flew out of several mouths right away. The game allows many viable avenues towards scoring. The idea of having three offenses in the form of your different dice is new to me, as "deck building" card games are not in my repertoire. With a handful of trials, I've found spaces I don't wish to include in my games. The effect of the card deck should be that each game is a welcome surprise. Instead, I now loathe a square or few. We shall see if this changes as I participate in more games. But hey, at the end of the day, I still want to play more!

Really innovative in the way the dice faces are pried out and replaced over the course of the game.  But that didn't necessarily leave me eager to play again.  Move around the board to claim dice faces, and if you roll a special face, things happen that usually get you points.  There's a point target that makes somebody win, which moves lower every time somebody rolls a 1.

Rattlebones is an incredibly original and extremely enjoyable roll and move game.  That's right.  You're just going to be rolling and moving, but you're actually going to be having a lot of fun.  The way the dice are manipulated through the game, with actually changing their sides, is really fascinating.  Changing up strategy (yea, actual strategy in a roll and move game), is pretty important, as is catching some good luck here and there.  I was really impressed with this one.

I wasn't expecting much, but WOW what a stinker of a game! 

The physical components, and concept of dice with interchangeable faces is brilliant! If it was attached to a remotely interesting game I would have been pretty happy. Rattlebones, however, is a terrible game. Uninteresting, devoid of any theme or interesting decisions. Even for a super light game it is well below par. 

I really hope we see those dice in a well designed game at some point.

Great production value. The changing faces on dice is a great idea, I'm probably rating it a little higher than I normally would a game like this because of it. It's fun and quick. It's easy to call this one "roll and move" but you can customize your dice so there is very little movement of your monkey pawns. I like the shrinking victory point total each time you roll Rattlebones. Good family/closer type game.

This game has a unique game mechanic in the customizable dice.  It's really fun, but there are some flaws.
1) The game provides no way to organize all of the pieces.  If you don't take the time to find containers for all of the separate pieces, it can take about 30 minutes just to set up.
2) The paint on the dice faces can rub off very easily.  It's a good idea to coat all of the pieces with a clear coat of some kind before playing with it.
3) This may sound stupid, but it's very easy to forget which color you are.  It's hard to explain why that is, but it happens a lot.

If they released a deluxe version that addressed these issues, it would be worth paying for.  It is a fun game.

RATING: 7
Changing the faces of your dice is a bit fiddly, but it does make for some interesting decisions.  You could have done the same mechanic with a changing chart of what the die sides do, but this has a better wow factor. 
You will immediately want to play again because you know you can build a better set of dice.  Not a deep thinker, but still quite fun.

Innovative dice building that seems to offer a lot of variation. I'm a bit doubtful of long term replayability, however, as I feel like the strategic-tactical nature of the game leads to certain optimal strategizing, with one power die, one supporting die and a tertiary die. Thematically the game makes sense, it looks good and the production values are decent. Faces of the dice should have been of better quality. Now the print is wearing out too easily.

So, this is another game with definite flaws that I still love. If there is more than one points space, the ideal play is always to just have a face that's overloaded on points and arrows. But it's way less fun than throwing a ton of different faces on and just giggling the entire time. The simple act of popping faces off and replacing them with new ones is great, and I love the variety in the face options.

UPDATE: Flaws overcame my interest in playing it. Fantastic concept, underwhelming execution.

Most importantly, the gameplay is smooth, quick and fun! I can't believe this didn't get more coverage at BGG con 2014! It was certainly one of my favorites, and I played a LOT of games there! Congratulations, Stephen Glenn. You nailed it again!

Roll-and-move for the modern day. People often say they hate dice games where you can have little effect on the die result. Well in this game you actually change the make-up of the dice!
So far every play has been interesting and I've had different decisions to make to try to win. I don't know yet about longevity, but for now I'm really enjoying this.

Nice tiwst as being a dice building game. it's a playful and luck is still important. Since it   has a short game play (30min), luck is ok.
Nice gateway

RATING: 5
A good idea executed badly. The roll-and-move doesn't really bother me, because in actuality it's a form of engine-building with some luck thrown in. What ruins the game, for me, is that if the game goes on long enough, you can find yourself just chucking dice until Rattlebones meets up with someone on the score track. There are some good ideas here, and while I did enjoy the game well enough, this is not a good design at all. I do hope someone else takes a stab at the customized dice face idea though. There's certainly room for creativity there.

A family style game with limited strategy and lots of push your luck mechanics.  Rattlebones is a roll and move game with a dice building mechanism could be interesting mechanism.  The dice building mechanism  is innovative.  Several of the other game mechanisms are meandering and based on luck. . Can anyone tell me what the point of the Train?

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]I really had fun playing Rattlebones with my kids, but after 12+ plays I felt like we had explored everything the game currently has to offer. I still think this is an excellent gateway game for a family and a great example of a game that took the roll and move mechanic and made it engaging. If an expansion were to come out that added different dice abilities to the game I'd pick up a copy again.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]- Brilliant family game, quick rules explanation and your off and running.
- I wasn't sole on the theme until I actually got the game, but it works quite well, I love the art and the components are top notch (especially the dice).
- Dice building, you are actually constructing your dice (removing faces and popping on new ones).
- This game is just fun, trying out new ways to construct your dice is a blast especially since there are so many different combinations of abilities to try.[/i]

規則:
*隨機從12片版塊中抽取７張，填滿圖板上的空格，將火車米寶放在圖板中間的鐵軌上0的位子，4/3/2人遊戲時，將團長米寶放在65/60/55分的位置
*玩家將他的３隻猴子米寶放在START格老鼠米寶放在計分軌０並拿取３顆骰子（白＋黑＋灰），隨機起始
*每次行動時，３顆骰子中選１顆擲，可以花一枚金幣來多擲一顆骰
>骰面是結果做對應事情
>是點數就選一個米寶走對應格並可選擇是否要改變骰面，如果是團長，將團長的分數下降一分。接著玩家可以選擇一個他的猴子米寶移動１格。
*玩家用那顆骰讓猴子米寶移動，骰面就只能替換到那個骰子上。
*米寶移動後，玩家可以選擇放棄不更換骰面。
*當玩家的分數超過團長米寶時，遊戲立刻結束。分數最高的玩家獲得勝利！
如果平手的話，黃金＋股票＋星星數量總和最多的玩家獲勝。
如果還是平手，就維持平手。

Rattlebones does "dice-building" in the most literal of ways--you move around the board collecting plastic sides which you physically install on your dice.  This allows you to slowly build several types of point engines but also remove your ability to gain more sides (which are mostly provided by the starter sides).  The sides that are available vary from game to game, providing some nice replayability.  Sure, it feels a little gimmicky at times, but I think it works as a short filler with engine-building.

Where was the developer on this thing???  They have this magnificent idea/gimmick, and even had a cool concept but didn't seem to bother to check for dominant strategies, some faces are just so much better than the others and the number of divergent strategies I estimate to be around 2.  I want to play the good version of this game so badly, hopefully it gets made eventually.

It has been a while, but this game as a core game mechanism I haven't seen before: customize your dice. Off course in the end, you are still rolling dice, so you need some luck with your rolls. It stays in the category of family gaming, but luckily doesn't take too long to play.

Just a sidenote: on the box in mentioned 'Printed in the USA with Pride'. Really? The quality of the printing is really bad. Colours are flat and the board has the tendency to curl. This is awful quality, even the better Chinese like Panda produce better quality, so I hope this ain't the best the USA can do on printing :s

Dice-building is an interesting twist on deck-building, however the game essentially devolves to a roll your dice move your mice mechanic. There are very few decisions to make, which makes the game feel not so much like a game but rolling dice to pass the time. Plus, the fact that the dice by and large determine what happens on your turn, the outcome is largely dictated by luck, which is not a feature I look for in games.

Very cool concept - Everyone start with 3 "Lego Dice", set up with pips on all sides (save the 1).  Move around the board, every space you land on gives you the option to replace the pip side with something else (an effect, resource, victory points, etc) - basically load the dice - until the end condition is met.  Creepy carnival theme and unrecognizable pawns (rabbits in hats and mice) really ruined what is (IMO) a really cool concept.

This is a gimmick I can get behind. The customizable dice are way cooler than I expected. Sure, there is a lot of luck, espcially in the first half of the game, and some upgrades are obviously better than others, but once this game gets moving it's a riot. Everyone was shouting "RATTLEBONES" every time the timer ticked down laughing when rolls got out of control. It also helps that the funky carnival theme makes for a beautiful board layout. I hope this game sees more support in the future.

This is the most under-rated game on BGG. For a family game this is super fun. Some have  commented this is a roll and move game. Maybe so but it feels more like a large rondell to me.

Removing the die sides is not fiddly (and I am picky about fiddly games.) It takes about 4 seconds. The Dice Tower made it sound like it took way too long to change the dice. Seriously reviewers, can we be a bit more honest about some of this stuff? Either that or admit if you have a dexterity problem so the blame doesn't go to the game.

The game gets tense when Rattlebones gets closer and closer to the players on the score track. Trying different tactics when building your dice is fun too.  This game is just a blast.  

Rating based on 2 player games. I highly recommend this if you enjoy family style games.

first impression:  There are actual choices, but not quite as many as I'd like -- often you simply have no good choices or the best option is obvious.  The game is short, but not quite as short as I'd like -- it's not long, but it should be shorter given the level of luck.  The dice gimmick is great, but not quite as great as I'd like -- the arrow face is brilliant in how it uses the physicality of the dice, but some faces are boring or nearly useless.

update: with a few house rules, the game goes up a point for me.  Making all the special faces valuable, instead of a few being mostly break-even, makes the game shine.  Then you really benefit from strategically planning your dice, not just lucking into the good faces, while also definitely needing to tactically deciding how to position your monkeys, instead of just always taking the move that gives you one of the good faces.

House Rules:
 - When you roll a coin face, take the coin then flip the die over and obey that face.  If you get a 2nd coin face, take a coin but don't flip again.
 - The x2 face doubles all other dice, not just one other die.
 - the 2nd half of players start the game with a coin, to counteract first turn advantage
 - Maybe: start everybody with an arrow face on each of their 3 dice, so they begin the game differentiated

I've only played this game once, but I had a great time with it.  The basic mechanic of changing out the sides of the dice... I dunno, there was just something about it that appealed to me.  Even if it wasn't good for my strategy, I was always about getting new sides.  The game also plays quickly, which is something that's missing in a lot of the games I've played lately.

I would think that this game has very little replay value, as the unique mechanics would become stale after a while.  If you are the type of person that plays only with the same group of people, you may hate this game.  However, if you're a bit of a social butterfly who loves introducing games to people, this would be one you would want in your arsenal.

This is exactly how roll and move games should evolve in the future... Really cool 'dice builder' where you can add differing abilities to each of your 3 dice. Then use them to help you score points.

Also love the end game mech where it's the first one to meet Rattlebones round the track that wins (Roll Rattlebones on your dice at any times move him towards everyone else's scoring mouse marker).

A few niggles:

The star points scoring seems way too high (especially if you combine it with the 9 pip face).

It can be easy to get left behind early on with little way of catching up.

Games can end very abruptly before you get your points scoring engine in full swing.

But - overall a great effort with really cool customizable dice and with a random setup thus making each game different.

1 play, 4er

A fun, light, dice roller! The game uses a roll-and-move mechanic to get going, but mitigates it:
- you have 3 pawns, so a lot of flexibility in where you want to land
- as you start changing your die faces, you move less and are instead taking point-earning actions.

Has the feel of a deck-builder since you're building a pool of possible actions, but with more randomness and speedier game play. You could probably all roll your dice simultaneously (and keep hidden if you like) just so you can plan your actions at the same time to speed game play.

Very enjoyable, but I hope this mechanism can be used in a meatier game!

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
[u]Setup[/u]
- Place the Rattlebones meeple at 55, 60, or 65 VP space (for 2-4 players). Players each get 3 d6 (black, white, gray) -- basic d6 but the '1' is replaced by Rattlebones.
- Place random tiles on the empty spaces on the board.

[u]Your Turn[/u]
Roll a die. May spend 1-2 gold to roll an extra 1-2 dice. Then, use each die one at a time:
- if Rattlebones shows, move Rattlebones back one space; game ends immediately if it hits a player score marker and most points wins.
- if pips or Rattlebones showing, move one of your pawns clockwise that many spaces (RB=1) and use the space you land on. Typically, you may add a die face matching that space to the die you used (replace any face except Rattlebones).
- otherwise, take whatever action the face allows (e.g., earn a stock marker or star token, which you may later turn in for VP; earn VP; steal stuff from other people; etc.).

RATING: 7
This is a roll and move game.  It is also super light and luck filled.  These are all things I typically shy away from in a game.  Put them all together and most likely you have a game I'm going to despise.  However, I was quite taken with this one.

The game is a literal dice building game.  By that I mean the faces of the dice are replaced throughout the game.  Each player has 3 dice.  To start they are typical dice numbered 1-6.  You roll one of the 3 dice each round, move on a circular track on the board, and land on a space that will allow you to replace one of the faces of the die with a new symbol that will give you one of any number of different special benefits from earning points, to rolling additional dice, to stealing from opponents, etc.  You have 3 dice to work with (and you can never get the numerical sides back once they're replaced) so there are decisions in this game related to which die (or occasionally dice) to roll each round.

You also have a choice of 3 different pawns to move around the track.  My friend suggested this made it a little better than most roll and move games, which I don't particularly agree with.  You have more than one pawn to move in Parcheesi too but that doesn't make it a better game than Monopoly to me.  But again, the fact that it is a roll and move game didn't really get to me like it normally would.

The game just has incredible charm.  I really enjoyed replacing the faces on my die, it was unique and perhaps that distracted me from the down sides of the game's design.  I was also able to accept it for what it was, a very light, fun, filler.  I just rolled the dice, tried to make the best decisions, and it was over in 20 minutes with a smile on my face.

RATING: 5.75
The dice in this game are very innovative in that you can change the die faces (ie dice building). The actual game though is just okay. Essentially you roll your die and either move on the board to get a new face for one of the die's side or perform the action on the die. I wish the game matched the awesomeness of the dice.

tl;dr: enjoyable dice building game

A dice building game! Not a dicepool building game, no, you actually build your dice! During the game you get to customize the die faces to have some kind of deck building effect: choose which actions you might get, and then roll to see which ones you actually get. A bit like deck building indeed.
It's a fairly light game and only takes about half an hour. Enjoyable enough, and the dice customization is a welcome gimmick.

Umm... The critics are wrong on this one.  Please don't overlook it because it got some critical comments from the gamer crowd.  This is a wonderful gateway game.  Certainly, there's luck galore!  HOWEVER!  You feel personally responsible for the luck because, well, it's all your fault if you lose.  

Rattlebones moves forward slowly, but surely.  And your clicking out your dice faces quickly building a little engine that could.  I built an entire die of trains.   I quickly caught up with my daughter who had jumped on the star express.

There are literally endless combinations and layers to the game, YET it is simple enough to teach to a 6 year old.    My sons are going  to love it  (6 and 8).

Lastly, though I am certainly not a fan of the circus, nor of clown, nor especially of monkeys, the whole thing kind of works.  Every time Rattlebones moved forward we started rolling our r's and saying "rrrattlebones..." in the creepiest way.  Our first game took about 50 minutes.  We had some icons to learn.. The next ones will go quickly.

This is a superb family/gateway game!  Not to be missed by families with 6 through 16--or anyone who doesn't have a fit if they can't control everything ("serious gamers").  Enjoy while you can still grab it for a steal at Amazon.

RATING: 7
It revolves around each player having 3 dice that start out as regular dice. As you move around the board and land on different spaces, you get to remove faces of your dice and replace them with different actions that get you points. This mechanic is very cool and I've never seen anything like it. You can customize each of your dice differently and eventually get some pretty good engines going. I completely crushed my opponents, but I'm pretty sure that was almost entirely because they rolled poorly while I rolled well. This is a great family game that can work as a lighter gamer's game.

Rattlebones scores high on many levels, the first of which is the unique structure and use of the game's dice.  Some may be wary that they are more a gimmick than an integral part of the game.  Rest assured, that is not the case here - and while technically, you roll and move in this game, it is not a roll and move game at all - it is more a deck builder with dice.

The game is not deep, so if that is what you are looking for,  search out some cubes and meeples. But this game offers a whole lot of fun and surprisingly, there are are a good many paths to victory. Depending on how the board shakes out, the strategies tend to differ nearly every time..

I have won numerous ways, once cashing in 8 stars on my final two turns to win from far behind.  This is a fantastic and well balanced design.  I highly recommend you grab a copy - it is a truly unique gaming experience.

It is pretty idiotic to make a family game only go up to 4 players, but even with that Rattlebones still looks like a great family game. I'm intrigued by the dice building thing - looks like something a lot of games could steal - and the endgame condition - Rattlebones moving back on the track. Definitely one to try.

Really cool idea horribly implemented.  I consider this game a real missed opportunity.  The way the dice are used during the game completely misses the mark on how to make a dice building game fun and exciting.  The game makes it feel like you are trying to build a sort of dice-based engine, but you get to roll multiple dice so infrequently that it feels less like an engine and more like a plough that keeps getting stuck up in rocky soil.  Very dull.

This game is really innovative, but it feels like a mechanic rather than a game itself.

Once you build your dice into something interesting, you're just sitting there collecting. And the fun of roll and move (and yes, I think roll and move can be fun if it still gives you choices) is getting to move.

If this were a mechanic in a larger game with more choices, I think I would really like it. As it is, it's not for me.

It teaches a lot of concepts about trade-offs that are useful in future gaming, and it does it in a way that's fun and engaging.  I was pleasantly surprised, especially that it wasn't fiddly like I thought it would be. Honestly, it would probably get a 7 from me (which is still good), but seeing my kid as engaged as he was, it gets an 8 and earns every bit of it. Great family game.

Best implementation to date of the deck-building concept in a light game.

Fun dice game with changing dice. Very light. Not bad but not good either. Really just a roll a move that sells the idea of manipulating dice.

Really interesting game. I like being able to modify the dice faces. I kind of wish it was more likely that you would roll certain things, but now that I think about it, I could quite reliably roll what I wanted as long as I modified the dice the right way. Definitely a fun game.

Just based on the laughs and tension I've felt in the game deserves me giving it a solid 7 rating. As a family game, it's probably even higher and it plays pretty quick even with 4. At heart it's a roll-and-move game with a twist. The ability of changing the die faces is revolutionary and truly a new mechanic in search of a more serious game to use it in. But for this game, it's enough to ponder the choices available while naively assuming you have any control over the roll of your dice. Bottom line is silly fun that doesn't outlast it's welcome.

The buildable dice mechanic is quite cool.  

The game itself is ok - very light.

Hopefully someone will take the dice mechanic and build a meatier game around it.

Circus-themed but mostly abstract roll-and-move to advance your monkey pawn before Mr. Rattlebones counts down using modifiable dice

I wanted to like this game a lot because of the unique way you can change the sides of your dice that other games are slowly starting to implement. Unfortunately there's just too much luck and you never really feel like you're doing anything which makes this a bit of a dud in my book.

Family dice games should be quick and fun. I'm not sure this is either.

[i]Rattlebones[/i] is also underdeveloped.  Gold coins are terrible (trade a turn now for an extra turn later - uh, why?), and there appear to be some pretty obvious strategies.

Cool idea, though, despite the imperfect execution.

We know this is a high score but we loved it. I must confess my wife wanted this game more than I did but now that we bought and played it ... I'm hooked.

The dice changing is a cool idea, but the game is kinda weak.

I love the concept, and the extensive replayability.  I'd have preferred to have a deeper game wrapped around that awesome mechanism of die face replacement, though.

Still, fun to build your own dice as you go!

RATING: 10
The pinnacle of miniatures gaming. An incredibly tight ruleset, with the 23 teams offering a broad, challenging gaming experience. Sixth edition rules greatly balance league play, making it a great hobby campaign game. There are lots of great sculpts for teams out there, don't be afraid to look and give this a whirl.

Ahhh, the first board game I ever became obsessed with. Hands down the best miniatures game GW every came up with (in my opinion). I don't play anymore but rate it as such because I spent years back in high school playing the game with my friends and loving it. If I was in the right situation I would happily start it up again.

One of my favorite games of all time.  Don't get to play it nearly as much as I would like (in fact I can't remember the last time I played the board game version) but I can't think of a game I enjoy playing more.  I love the tactics involved as well as the team progression from game to game.

I'd rather play: CHESS (turtling)

If the game was more focused on scoring, rather than defending, it would be amazing.

Instead, it's two hours to grind out a 1-0 win. Also, I've never heard people bitch about luck like they do in this game.

The great Blood Bowl, which is the only Games Workshop game that has retained its fun value for me - I have a lovely fully painted team too! It works because it has a great sense of humour to go with its relatively simple playing rules. It has been constantly updated and they are now publishing a "living rulebook" through their website and you can download it for free if you wish and make your own board and pieces up. A free game? Sure!

Juego de fútbol americano entre razas de fantasía con violencia incorporada. Un sistema elegante de cambio de turno en el momento en que fallas la tirada para realizar alguna acción que hace cada partido un reto en el que tienes que ver cuales son las prioridades y decidir qué riesgos has de asumir. Muchísimas posibilidades tácticas dependiendo qué jugadores tengamos en el terreno de juego. Por otro lado el sistema de ligas y de mejoras de los jugadores (tambien el de lesiones!) es de lo mejor del juego, ir viendo cómo tu equipo y tus jugadores van evolucionando...
Hay que sumergirte un poco en el sistema para sacarle todo el jugo, conocer un poco las habilidades, los tipos de jugadores...
Toda una institución de juego!

I've spent hours playing this on FUMBBL. Some of the L communities on that site are well worth your time. R and B don't particularly interest me, however, and the benevolent dictatorship that rules there and the Old Boy's Club atmosphere may significantly hurt your enjoyment. As a TT game it's often too long.

Blood Bowl is the only board game I travel to other countries to play!  Best tournament game out there, and I love the game itself as much as all the other boardgames that we play over the weekends.  Every turn of this game is the epitome of pushing your luck and risk management with immense strategic positioning and planning several turns in advance.  Best game ever produced by Jervis and Games Workshop.

Played in a league for two seasons and stopped for a few reasons. Just far too much luck involved in the game; no matter how good your plan is, the dice will always screw you over. Also the players I was playing against tended to suck a lot of fun out of playing.

Rating based on BGGs recommended description of what a '2' represents. Based on Living Rulebook at time of writing April 2009.

I love 3rd edition blood bowl but I loath what has happened to the game during the Living Rulebook period. Far too much of the humour and mayhem has been drained from the game in the pursuit of balance and 'every team being competitive' at all times (during league play). It's not at all what the mythos of the game represents to me.

The writing of the Living Rulebook is also an issue. As an in-depth set of tournament floor rules or comprehensive rulebook it is very good (it puts me in mind of WOTC's MTG tourney floor rules). As an example of how to engage a new player and give them something 'easy to pick up and learn' the rulebook is terrible in my opinion.

The core game engine is in itself very strong (see third edition) the developments and direction the game has taken do not represent a fun game set in the world of blood bowl for me. Theme has certainly taken back seat to competitive rules-lawyering which for me at least is to the detriment of the overall gameplay experience. 

Alas, as the BGG rating says, I'll not be playing this again :(

Honed ruleset - Still a few wrinkles that need attention, but great fun!

Have fully painted 16 player teams for:
 
Orcs
Humans
Wood Elves 
Dark Elves
High Elves
Dwarfs (w/ Death Roller)
Skaven (Looking for mutant player minis)
Chaos (w/ Mino and Mutant Minis)
Lizardmen (11 Skinks, 6 Saurii, plus Krox)
Undead (With Figs to use the team as Necro, too)

Looking to get: Nurgle, Chaos Dwarfs, Amazon, maybe norse, next (Increasingly difficult to get figs now that GW has discontinued it, and I like collecting, painting and playing with their minis rather than 3rd party teams. Only myself to blame, really :/).

My favorite game.  No other game captures the same tactical wargame feel that this does, yet makes it so very simple to play, entertaining, full of variety, and has a sports tie in which just really takes the cake.

The best version of american football, even better than the actual live sport :) This implements the football rules very nicely in same combination with Warhammer-ish look and feel.

I think that Blood Bowl is the very best of Games Workshops Specialist Games range..... And apparently I'm not alone. Our gaming group nearly doubles as soon as we decide to play a Blood Bowl league.

The scope of the game is huge. With the large number of teams (21 currently official 3 more experimental) and the almost limitless combinations that those teams can create by taking different player and staff options. The game play is fast with little downtime, the models look good (though not up to the standard of current GW miniatures) and there is a good balance of risk vs reward.

This game is not quite such a money pit as other Games Workshop products, but it has still cost me quite a few hundred Australian Dollars, but that might be because I am a fanatic with 2 complete Third Edition sets (with a complete Second Edition set as backup) and 8 complete teams of about 20 models each. Now all I've got to do is paint them.

Was rated 7. If GW doesn't want their products covered by this site, though, I'll oblige (to a degree).

Fantasy football. No, really, fantasy like with elves and animated skeletons and stuff. A nice GW offering from when they were willing to laugh at themselves, now relegated to the back bench. Painting is annoying to me, but at least you only need to finish a dozen or so figures to have a full team. More random than I strictly like, and it has some counterintuitive rules, but still a fun way to pass an afternoon. Apparently works really well in an ongoing league format, although I've never gotten the chance to try that.

The rating is for one-off games, but if you invest the time needed to play in leagues/tournaments, Blood Bow is a 10 for me. BB was also the game that got me back into boardgaming after college, where I simply stopped playing anything. While I still play BB occasionally, after so many games in the last years I am now much more interested in exploring other titles.

RATING: 7.2
RULES: **** - A lot of examples help to pass the message nicely. Minor rule collisions here and there, but it should be expected from a rulebook with more than 10 pages.
STRATEGY: **** - There are several not too difficult choices you have to make even before the ball is kicked. Planning ahead strongly recommended.
TACTICS: ***** - A lot of fun ways of doing what you have planned be it scoring a touchdown or kicking the crap out of you opponent's players.
LUCK: *** - There is a lot of dice throwing in this game, however, there are some means to manage the risk and get better chances at success.
PLAYER INTERACTION: *** - The game proceeds in turns, so you don't have much to do during your turn except watch the things unfold. However, you can seriously mess up your opponent during your turn instead.
REPLAYABILITY: **** - there are a lot of very different teams with different abilities, so you shouldn't really feel like the game is the same all the time. Championship mode is terrific.
THEME: ***** - it's all about theme. Blood and gore of the Blood Bowl game is right there when you play the game.
BALANCE: *** - Goblins, Halflings and the likes are terrible to play with and some other races seem to be better than the most, but overall it's balanced enough to be playable.
DOWNTIME: *** - it may get boring when the other player is doing his turn, as you don't have much to do at that time. Except cheering your miniatures to kick opponent's ass, that is.
ACCESSIBILITY: ** - the game is long and expensive, however, you need only two players, so you may find an opponent fairly easily. However, this will not be the easiest game to talk people into playing.

(100+ games)  A living rulebook that makes a great game even greater.  Unlike most Games Workshop games, BB:LRB makes for a reasonably balanced game.    This game is about chaos mitigation.  A good plan combined with better luck management will win the game.
...and the luck can be managed.  [q="Barticus88"]There are some games where people who like dice appear luckier than people who don't like dice.  This is one of the most extreme of those games.  The dice average out, and you rarely get screwed except when you push your luck.  People who don't like dice push their luck too often and get unlucky a lot.  [/q]
  This was quoted from Stone Age but works here.  The difference is that you always have to push your luck so you play your best odds, that are most important, first.

A better player, with an equal valued team, almost always wins.

Not as good as the 3rd edition...the new rules favoring "balance" (appearance fees, Big Guy restrictions, player deterioration, skills vs. traits, new injury chart) cheapens the game considerably. If you keep the original rules (fouling and killing, for example) you don't have to worry about a lot of the "game balance" issues...players die! I do use the Living Handbook for the Plaguebearers of Nurgle team. Otherwise, I own almost two dozen teams and run leagues with the 3rd edition rules.

RATING: 7
A fantasy miniatures war game, with a twist.  Instead of engaging your opponent in battle, you are playing a rugby/football-like game.  There is also the added twist that your players can develop over time, gaining skills that allow them to play better at Blood Bowl.  Fouling in the current rules version is not as good of an option as earlier editions.

Kept alive long after its abandonment by the love of the players, the CRP is Blood Bowl honed to a near razor edge. Playful, humourous, intriguingly deep yet still easy to learn, games are not always quick, but the balance is outstanding and there's enough here to last a lifetime.  The league rules take a great game to sublime heights, adding in rpg-like player progression and a genuine sense of emotional investment. Beautiful.

A quality game (see comments for Bloodbowl), which only improved through the feedback and hard work of others out there. This is a great and exciting game, and works really well with combining a football game with an season-based game too (through the rulebook), allowing for some give and take over the season. The only problem with this game? Not enough people playing it.

This is in response to GW's request to have most of their player aids and rules references pulled from BGG. While I understand that it is within their rights to do so, I also believe that their is such a thing as being NICE. That is, as long as someone isn't hurting you, you should be good to them, even if it is with in your rights to be a grade A jerk. I find people that are jerks in these situations to be extremely, extremely annoying. So annoying, in fact, that the annoyingness transcends all rules, game types, and genres. Needless to say, Blood Bowl falls within this category and therefore gets a "2" rating, as it is 'extremely annoying". On the bright side, it is still not as bad as You Can't Check Me, not that I would ever buy either one or ever suggest to anyone one else ever to do the same.

One of the GW offshoot games that I never really cared for. It just never grabbed me...

For a short time we played this campaign style, and I used the unofficial Goblin/Squig team that was printed in one of GW's magazines. I basically just wanted an excuse to paint some squigs though.

The only real positive thing about this game, to me, is that it was/is relatively cheap vis a vis the other stuff that GW puts out.

Much prefer stuff like Necromunda to this though.

Amazing depth and good learning curve. It keeps growing on you. Choose your opponent carefully though. It's a "ladder system" where you develop your team over several games.

The only game I've played that, with luck as a MAJOR contributing factor, is almost perfect in its design. In a few more years I will likely award this game my first 10 ever. I've played, literally, about 500 matches of Bloodbowl at this point, and enjoyed (or HATED) every single match I've played!

It is the only game I've ever played in tournaments and focused on enough to become a "competitive" player. Though my league play is about third tier at best.

RATING: 10
The updates added to LRB5/6 make this an exceptionally well balanced game.  The combination of luck + rerolls + turnovers makes Blood Bowl a tense, exciting, game of playing the odds.  Luck can decide the outcome of a game either way but, over time, the best players will win.  It is more like Poker than Chess in this respect.  Even without the fantasy football theme, this is a great tactical sports game.  Add the richly detailed Warhammer universe and it's an instant classic.

I've run two leagues of this, where I owned the minis for every team.  People love it.  We once had four boards set up on the same conference table for the last day of the regular season, and it was the greatest gaming experience of my life.  Then there was the overtime semi-final where the entire league was shouting at the board I was on.  It was like an actual football game.  Still get chills.

It is simply the greatest possible game.  Strategy and tactics.  Luck and skill. Theme and structure.  Long term and short term gratification.   Non-stop action.  Playing is rewarded more than winning.  Built in handicap system.  You simply could not improve any part of this experience.

The Living Rules really tightened up the campaign system that had been slapped together so many times in the past. And Blood Bowl only shines in this context, so I consider this quite an achievement! Single one-off games are always a bit silly, but in a league context this is awesome and merits a higher rating.

Never played a physical game of this, this rating is solely based on the computergame. The number of plays is a mere estimation. I participated in three seasons with a skaven team. The game is great fun, because it doesn't takes itself too serious. The humour is basically eye-twinkling brutality. The dice rolls allow for all kind of shenanigans and epic fails, like a wood elve catcher sprinting towards the touchdown line, falling over his own feet and dying miserably on the field.
However, I don't like playing against defensive or all too brutal teams like the dwarfs, whose tactics consists of securing the ball, forming a protective cage and advancing at snail-speed towards the line. Boring. Much prefer the skaven or woodelf playstyle.

The good: A very fun quirky theme. The fluff really plateaued at the 3rd edition. It looks like in later LRBs some fluff was added to support the new rules, pretty substandard stuff.

The bad: Dull game play. Bad enough that there has to be a rule punishing players if they want to leave early. Its pretty uninspired. 

The verdict: There's just too many good skirmish size miniatures games out there (XWing, Attack Wing, Imperial Assault) to waste time on this.

Played the LRB rules at FumBBL.. The game is challenging to play well and the long tail effect of your team's fumbles makes playing it a bitter sweet experience. The game is good and very, very thematic. What made it less interesting to me was that I started with Undead and Khemri but they seemed to suck at football :). But I was less interested in the football than the fantasy part of the game and I realized that learning to play well with them was extremely challenging; the game is still primarily a game of football and you need those goals to win. And I am less interested about that than just zombifying the opposing team.. Plus, those damn zombies just can't catch that ball, seriously.

Unlike most board games, this game has been continuously refined over the years, and is now a very complete experience.  It has tactical depth (in game play), strategic depth (the seasonal/roleplaying aspect), enough randomness to allow even a poor player to occasionally win, and enough tactical/strategic depth to ensure the better player wins more often than not.  Perfect.

I have decreased the rating from an 8 to a 7. There are some reasons behind this. The best way to play this game is in league format either in a tournament or a league. The team then develop and get more skills. On the other hand, I feel that I don't want to play often enough to keep up with a league.

Some say that the game comes down to die rolls and while this is true it is not really fair. What you can do as a player is to force the other player to make bad die rolls. The teams in the game are very different in the way they play.

RATING: 10
Easily the best game Games Workshop has produced.
Pros: miniature games that takes place on board: no scenery to deal with, no 4x6 wargame table to deal with.
Only 11-12 miniatures needed per team. No 100+ minis like other wargames.
Only 11-12 miniatures to paint!
Very different feel for each team, very detailed rulebook and very impressive league format.
Theme is fantastic, and GW background is IMMENSE for such a small game.
Play within 2.5-3hrs. I wished it could be played quicker but that's because my friends and I spend a lot of time chatting while playing. The 4 minutes turn is too short IMO. 5 minutes is much better. 

Cons: Game is difficult to find, so are minis. 
Team pack from GW come with 11-12 minis, when you really want 13-14 with bench players.
They are GW minis, expect to pay top dollars for it.

I keep getting back to it (mark of a good game), and I keep being baffled as to why so few wargamer play this game. A solid 10 from me.

Ever since the first copy of the game WAY back came out I have loved the very concept of this game.  i.e.  Football the way it was MEANT to be played, really really violent.  (What the XFL SHOULD have done...)  A soft spot in me has always had me playing Da Maggot Scum (Goblins) as you have to love a team where blatant cheating and things going wrong is a way of life.  Over the years the evolution of the game continues and I adjust with it, and the players and friends I have met worldwide sharing a passion for this little gem from GW I will continue to treasure.  This game can really bring out the Ogre in you...or the Goblin in you if you're a Troll.  ("Whaddya means he's Hungry?!")

The most recent living rule book (6) which is now for download on GW's site as "competition rules pack" is the tightest most balanced rules set ever created for blood bowl and is truly one of the greatest games of all time.  This is the big monster of all sports board games and with the tweaks to the rules is one of the most balanced variable player power style games out there.  There really isn't anything else like it and every board gamer needs to play it at least once.  Risk management is the name of the game.

I completely enjoy Blood Bowl. I find the variety of teams to be fun, the game to be interesting, and the leveling/campaign rules to be superb.

The only reason the score is not higher because of some of the opponents I've had to play against. I've seen this game bring out the absolute WORST in some people, with people screaming and yelling and generally being completely over-the-top. This is not really the game's fault, per se, but these same people do not have the same problem with other games so I ding it a bit.

That said, I love this game. Absolutely hilarious to play, and a lot of strategy and risk/reward that makes it a winner for me.

Great fun but really only shines if you are running a team over a period of time in a league or a tournament.

Simply one of the most addictive games around. Incredible depth of strategy and endless variety, the culmination of the rules into the LRB has polished up a messy, contrived set of rules from earlier editions into something that despite a lunatic level of complexity is actually somewhat consistent and comprehensible.

Leagues now works fine due to inductions.

The greatest minis game of all time. Not only are the teams affordable, but the campaign (league) rules work in a way no other minis games have.

The worldwide player community is fantastic and fan support for this game is amazing. Sold all my teams when the players in my area moved away. Lots of great memories with this one.

RATING: 5
There is a potential for a good game here.  Alas, several factors make the game broken (and not just because of the high luck factor).

1.  Your turn ends when you fail (i.e. you drop the ball or have one of your players knocked down).  This merely exacerbates the luck factor.  A better game would utilize impulses.  You get x number of moves no matter what, then your opponent gets y, then you get x, and so forth.  

2.  Related to point #1, the end game is too predictable.  If I have a 1-0 lead and the ball with 4 turns left, I am going to guard the ball instead of try to score.   Make the game with an unpredictable ending - and I dont mean like soccer where only the officials know how much time is actually remaining.  Instead, look at baseball for guidance.  A "turn" should last until the two players have combined for six "strikes" (a strike is anything that causes a turnover now).

3.  The team valuation over-values things like cheerleaders and under values players at high levels.  This leads to mismatches between teams that may be only valued within 50 points of each other.  

4.  The races are not balanced.  Frankly there is no reason to play anything but High Elves, Wood Elves, or Chaos.  These 3 teams are so over powered in relation to the other as to make the game a joke. Halflings and Ogres - forget it.

5. Kick off events, particular pitch invasion and blitz, break the game.  Instead of blitz being an event, you should be able to purchase Blitz moves like re-rolls. And there is no place for events like Pitch invasion in any serious game.

6.  There need to be more scoring options- like NFL or CFL football.  Touchdowns should be worth 6.  Kicking the ball out of the end zone should be worth 1.  There should be some equivalent of safeties and field goals.  The current scoring method is reminiscent of soccer. (Sorry all you non-Americans, but soccer is a snoozefest.)

I'm not going to give this a numerical rating.  I'm unhappy with a lot of the tweaks made...is Blood Bowl such a serious game that it even needs a living rulebook in the first place?  One year a werewolf does this, the next year, it's totally different.  One year the Dark Elves have a thrower, and now they don't.  Bleh.  Even the new stuff they add in (like the assassin), doesn't work as well as a lot of linemen and a few blitzers.  I don't know, there's potential here, but I think you can play forever just fine with the original rules tweaked to your own taste.

It's not fair to give this a rating as I only played a single half of a game. So I don't know a thing about league rules, team setup and development or differences among the various editions. The basic system just doesn't get me enough to invest the time needed to get out of this game what it could offer. It could be because my orc team was not the most fascinating team to play and our game turned out to be a close combat rather than a running game. The game was far too long for the fun moments it offered. I'll rather be playing Street Soccer.
Who said that ratings should be fair anyway? The average rating of this game is far too high in comparison to other games as this game benefits from being played mostly by people who know before that they like this type of game while the average Eurogame suffers from lots of people rating them that don't like them too much.

This game is super-thinky for a brawl, almost chess-like in that small mistakes can cause cataclysmic changes.  I love the figures, but I still have a lot left to paint.

There's not much to say about this one really. Over the years many more rules were added to the game and the living rulebook was the place where all of the rule adjustments came together.

Purchased the Box Set from Games Workshop's website.

It has everything you need to get started playing Blood Bowl which is why I picked it up.

Only thing you don't get is the most up to date ruleset (Blood Bowl Living Rulebook 5.0) but that is available for free from GW's site (as well as the Specialist Games' website).

I just wanted a goofy football game and I enjoy painting/modelling miniatures. 

The rules for League Play looks really nice. Almost like a pseudo sports-RPG since you can gain cash and improve your team.

This rating is actually for Blood Bowl played in a league with the latest edition of the Living Rulebook.  It's my favorite game when played in a league.  Outside of a league or tournament, it's maybe a 6.  I don't prefer miniatures or games workshop games (big understatement).  This one, however, has a good (and continually improving) rules set, a great balance of luck and tactics, and the figs add a lot to the enjoyment. There's nothing much better in gaming than building up a blood bowl team in a league. The rules do change every year or so, but they are available online now for free. It's the game I've traveled the farthest to play.  Played in about 10 leagues and several tournaments over the course of almost 20 years.

One of Game's Workshop's best efforts. A surprisingly thoughtful and engrossing game in spite of it's wacky and entertaining theme. The trouble is, to get the best out of the game you need to play a league. And that's a time sink like no other. One-off plays just aren't as good.

Simply an amazing strategy game. I say this as someone who loathes most everything about GW with a passion and thinks most forms of Warhammer are garbage.

Blood Bowl looks from a distance like a goofy beer and pretzels game, but it's not - it's an extremely deep strategic game with sharp, chess-like tactics, combined with player loss, an experience system, and team management. Wonderful.

Best of what Blood Bowl has to offer. Far too long and remains a Games Workshop game. Much better than the Warhammer series for knowing its limits and its general lack of cynical marketing. Funny, sometimes stupid, and usually fun. 

Keep in mind that taking too seriously a farcical football game that features Orcs and Elves and Mummies (etc.) will earn you disdain from many people who have things called "friends," and is unlikely to result in a date: this is deservedly so.

Its major weakness is its massive reliance on the dice: you will lose to newbies and children, even after years of experience and a "perfect" team build. Nonetheless, strategy and experience also have a heavy impact on the outcome.

over 1600 games in fumbbl.com + 3 tabletop tournaments and some random tabletop games.

From 2005 to this time, i find this game still as magnificent as when i started.

You can mix things up in a suboptimal way and still compete; or build that optimal team and compete "seriously" in tournaments; heck you can just play a funny team and get beaten up and have a good time.

One of the bet games I've ever played. I never get tired of it. I wish it didn't take 1-2 hours to play a game! Leveling up players and seeing them die is great... So few games make you care about the survival of your pieces as much as this one!

edit - had to lower my rating after realizing I was no longer playing this because I wasn't willing to invest an hour and a half per game. My attention span for games has shortened and I find I only play shorter games now.

I am the commissioner of the Regina Flatland Blood Bowl League.  

Running a Blood Bowl League is one of the most rewarding activities I have had in gaming.  This is my fourth year running a BB League.  I ran one back in 1995 and 1996 during the third edition era. And now this is our second season for the LRB (Competition Rule Book) era.

This season we have 13 players and in the first week we have already played 14 matches.  It is gonna be an amazing year.

Feel free to check out our shenanigans at www.reginaflatland.bloodbowlleague.com

When I was younger, Blood Bowl was a game that didn't get my attention much.  Now that I am all grown up, I must admit that it doesn't get my attention much more...which isn't to say it's a bad game but just that it takes a very particular crowd to enjoy this one.

The mechanism is a bit fiddly for a miniature game, which tends to diminish the fun factor.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
One of the two GW products I play at all, though the lesser in my eyes.  While still fun for a match and better in a campaign, the game suffers the usual troubles of dicey miniatures games that has lead to players tending toward a handful of optimal strategies based entirely on probabilities, then just hoping the dice fall their way.  It is sad in such a clever game to spend more time rolling dice than making real choices.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Most of the Living Rulebook set are just tweaks on 3rd edition for tournament play, but the improvements are good ones, the game remains excellent & is also one of the few unbroken games by GW (I think because they are no longer involved in rules development).

Teams : Dark Elves, Wicked Elves, High Elves, Chaos, Orcs.

Although I like "Wicked Elves" as a visual concept for the game, the expanded teams that have come about with the LRB are largely a waste of time & add nothing to the game & is a slight detraction in points

This is a great game and should be tried by all.  My favorite game and the new PBBL rules coming out later this year will make it even better.  You can have fun sitting down and playing the basic game as a fun light game.  Then add the advanced rules for a litte more complexity.  And finally play in a league where the game really comes alive as you build and develope your team or teams.  Every race is so different yet pretty balanced.

Move your players and roll dice to score most touchdowns.

With LRB3, Blood Bowl realized its potential as the greatest two-player game ever, and LRB4 improved even further on this. The game is humorous, exciting and challenging. I thought about aspects of this game every day for more than five years: my last game, planned tactics, skill choices, team-building etc. Every day! Perfection (fumbbl.com is what really makes this game shine.)
EDIT 2012-07: LRB5, the so called Competitive Rules Pack that is now the official rules set, actually made me stop playing. There are a lot of subtle reasons for this that I won't get into here, but LRB5 took the fun out of BB for me. LRB4 is still a 10 and will stay that way.

Plays: Several thousand, counting online play aginst humans.
Type: Thematic sports game = A theme-driven game that simulates a sport.
Complexity: Heavy sports game.
# of players: 2.
Playing time: 90 mins.
Player interaction: Conflict.
Randomness: Medium – Dice, but you can choose the desired risk v. reward ratio and the order of rolls.

Replayability: Replayability is limitless thanks to the variability of teams, strategies, tactics and dice. The rules system is complete and balanced after several editions. It has depth to explore and a campaign system that lets your team grow and improve. You’re always itching to use the new skills your players have aquired. I played several [i]thousand[/i] games!
Fun: Just fantastic fun. Blood Bowl can appeal to casual gamers and addicts alike: the casual crowd can enjoy the fast-paced excitement and general mayhem while the addicts can enjoy the strategical and tactical analysis. The theme is implemented with a great deal of tongue-in-cheek humour, and it’s still a great strategy game “under the hood”. Looks great, plays great. Team building adds to the fun of playing the actual game and plays a major part in bringing your team to life.
Memorability: No game I have ever played creates stories like Blood Bowl. You’re always feeling with your players, both when they succeed when they really should fail and when they fail when they really should succeed. You’ll always remember the time that your star Troll blocked a halfling for three skulls – AV break – RIP – regeneration fail, killing the Troll, as well as the time when your Mummy threw a long bomb to a Skeleton for the winning TD in the last turn.

Thematic integration: Extremely high.
Components: Fantastic. GW games always have great looking bits, and this is no exception.

Who will like this: Gamers that like the theme.

You should be careful with putting players with different skill levels against each other. Even if you handicap stronger players by giving them weaker teams, the stronger players can not only beat their weaker opponents, but destroy their teams and crush their fragile little spirits as well. BB is not a forgiving game for beginners.

Played only about 10 times (Chaos, Lizardmen and Norse). A bit too long (2H) for the fun. Could use a master player (in league play) who knows all the rules, for there are many. But i have a lot of fun playing, scoring, hurting and killing orcs, elves and others. Don't know what happened, but i won all the games i played until now. I knew i could be good at sthg! update2007: i just bought the game finally and am participating in a small league with friends. Just great.

Core game is good enough, maybe a bit slow for a sports game. Love the universe and concepts it is set in. The problems for us are that it cannot easily be picked up after too long an absence from play, and that to get the best enjoyment out of the system, many additional playing partners, much additional funds, and large commitments of time spent laboring but not playing the game are required.

I never really got into Blood Bowl much, since I wasn't big into the Warhammer 40k scene, until I found http://fumbbl.com.  This site is an online Blood Bowl server that uses LRB 4.0.  It is extremely well done, and you are free to experiment with as many different teams as you want.

The thing that really sets this game apart from other similar games is the season mode, which is basically a campaign for your team.  You level up your players, buy new ones, fans, and even star players.  The team building aspect of the game is very addicting, especially with the accessability of fumbbl.

I really like Bloodbowl.  I dispise Games Workshop.  I hate the superfluous dice rolls like injury severity, winnings, fanfactor, skills, etc.  The gameplay of pushing your luck because a failure ends your turn is wonderful.  Choosing after rolling the block dice adds a lot of depth.  Customizing your team creates multitudes of strategies.  This is no random dicefest.  There is meaningful gameplay that burns your brain.  On top of that the theme is fantastic.

I'd love to strip this game down to its best parts.  There is one hell of an excellent game under the caked on chrome.

Interestingly enough, I was working on a similar concept in 1984-1985 time frame.  Blood Bowl has definitely evolved over the years, which is both good and bad: the Good-it is still a fun game on a very unique subject matter; and the Bad-it is somewhat cumbersome and out-dated (e.g., the rules read from a 1980s wargame).  If you want to invest the time, then this is a decent game.  If you want to immediately start playing combat-football, try Battleball.  Awards: InQuest Gamer Top100-#74 (2007).

A supplement book for players to update from the earlier edition Blood Bowls. Includes all of the new rules and also systems for playing leagues (basically it includes 3rd Edition's Death Zone in the rules too)!

The CRP (BB's most recent rules set) is freely downloadable from GW rendering this book obsolete.

Be warned that with the LRB/CRP you will find that Blood Bowl is leaned towards bashing over elfball, as with over powered skills like Piling On its all too easy to obliterate teams rather then play the ball. Shame but I doubt we'll see a further rules set so make do with what you got!

The best ruleset yet I think. This edition is a free download from the Specialist Games section of the GW site. It is reviewed and updated every year which is great for keeping the game current however the committee that lead on that have a habit of introducing a lot of changes every year, which sometimes is a bit too much.  Bloodbowl is a fine game that is exciting and different every single time even though it is mechanically simple. Jervis' finest game by a country mile.

This is a game to be played in a league where the characters can evolve, gain skills and even die (that occurs frequently) :-) . The turnover rule (your turn ends right after an unsuccesful move) adds tension and though decisions to make.

All of my comments on Blood Bowl Third Edition apply here as well, but it is important to note how significant the living rulebook is.  The living rulebook has made Blood Bowl continuosly enjoyable to play because it has provided new players and teams as well as addressing rules questions and errata.  That a game this old still gets the support it does is really encouraging.  If you are going to play Blood Bowl, and you should, this is the ruleset you should use.

Being a fan of Skirmish style miniatures games, this scratches both the boardgaming and miniatures game itches almost perfectly. Simple rules with a reasonable learning curve with enough luck to entertain and give anyone a chance, but where skill and tactical play can mitigate it to a satisfying level.

Shame I'd rather be playing the game than painting miniatures, but I can usually scrounge up some usable figures as needed!

A solid always play for me.  Lots of different teams and lots of dynamic chaos interactions.  It can be a little hard to get started but with a little assistance from a friend, it's easy to get started mashing into things.  Two things to suffer with this game - GW continual rules updates (mitigated by not having to pay for it).  Yes, I know that it's mostly fan driven, but there is always GW looming in the background waiting to "help."  And two - some players won't like the utter chaotic nature of the game, I do, though, and like the interesting interactions that often occur.

Blood Bowl is a great game and to get the most out of it you really have to play it as a league.  However, the teams are seriously un-balanced.  I don't mind a bit of un-balance in my games, but if you play a league just bear in mind that the elf teams are going to win, and they're going to win easily.  Still worth playing just for a laugh though.

I also have the first edition (which sucked, despite the good childhood memories...) and (thankfully) the third, which rocked hard (one of the three best GW of all time, the other two being Space Hulk and Man'o'war). I love the way the living rulebook has refined and balanced the game to make the best out of the 3rd edition, without changing the wonderful mechanics of the game.

I have two stripped down copies of 3rd edition (just the board, dice, re-roll counters and templates from each one). Using this to play the LRB edition of Blood Bowl. I also managed to pick up the Dungeon Bowl components from the relevant issue of White Dwarf, so along with my copy of Warhammer Quest, that flavour of Blood Bowl is playable for me too.

Very happy with the current iteration of the rules, though less happy with Games Workshop's totally pointless interference with the Specialist Games division, that turns it into an anaemic shell of a business that hasn't released anything new for their product lines in years.

The LRB is just a bad idea. Input from players results in a persistent watering down of what once made this game great. Also, the current community of players is far too interested in tournaments. It's a game based on luck and dice rolling, how can it be a tournament game? Also, a game based this much on luck shouldn't involve as much calculations as it does. Preparing for a match can be more like accounting than football. What once was a silly game for beer & pretzels has become a game without any of the old chaos...and is still just as unbalanced. Not much fun.

RATING: 10
This game is an absolute 10 for me, for sure my all time favourite game.

The thematic is fascinating. Rules are complex but once you learn them the game system is tons of fun.

You can have years of experience playing but every play learn new things and strategies.

Unlimited game situations and lots of laughts with heroic plays and also when everithing goes wrong with initial plans.

Better edition than 2016 one.

Some peaople say it's too random, but I dont agree. You have so many options and possible actions and strategies that when you are rolling a dice you have to place your players smart in order that you are in the best position both if you succeed but don't be in a big plroblem if you fail. You decide if you play safe or take more risks for better reward. You usually don't win the game if you have luck, you usually win if you manage randomness wisely. And you can perform many actions rthat dont require randomness, for example moving your playrs doesn't require dice rolling unless you have to dodge someone or move more than your player's movement. Of course in a very matched game the winner can be decided by some random rolls, but in real sports this also happens, like in soccer the ball can hit the wood or be a goal just for a centimeter wich is also random.

Every team has its own personality and different kind of play. If you are an experienced player and want to compete with a rookie, you have weaker teams than the average that you can choose.

Good game although a little on the long side.
League play gives it a purpose however raises the stress levels.

Played for two 9 game seasons and a Dungeon Bowl cup final.
It was fun but a bit of a commitment to play every fortnight due to work commitments. Ultimately had to bow out of league at end of second season (undead team) but still miss it.

To me, Blood Bowl is the ultimate game and this is the ultimate edition. The mix of random mayhem and strategy (both short term per game and long term on team managment) are a hit with me. My only gripe with the current edition compared to 2nd edition is the shift in flavour and aesthetics, but that applies to Games Workshop as a whole too. I prefer the old miniatures to the new.

The latest version of this rulebook came with the newest 3rd edition of Blood Bowl.

The novelties in newer editions are quite successful. They alter the gameplay a bit, which might really be a hindrance to those who got used to the original 3rd edition rules.

I tend to modify my gameplay according to the rules so it matters to me not what kind of new things the latest edition added.

Blood Bowl is one of the shiniest stars of GW. It's really great to see that there is a solid will to keep the game alive.

(I'll record my Blood Bowl plays under the 3rd edition game title)

Adaptando los estándares gamesworkshoperos "te doy, te hiero, tiro de salvación" se creó un gran juego deportivo de fútbol americano fantástico-medieval. Gran cantidad de razas (equipos) diferentes, un sistema rápido de movimiento y acción, la posibilidad de que el equipo vaya adquiriendo experiencia según se van jugando partidos, etc, etc, hacen de él un difícil rival a batir en éste apartado de los juegos de mesa con figuras (o sin ellas). Buenísimo.

Blood Bowl is a great classic and arguably the best sports game around. And even straight out of box 3rd edition is a good game to play. Little too long for most friends, and 2 player only, so doesn't hit the table as often as I would like.

RATING: 9
The best BB rules for clarity and balance, and therefore for tournament play.

Downsides:
- Pitched to balance at a much lower power level than 3rd Ed, cutting out some of the epic scale powerhouses that I always enjoyed.
- In the name of balance, cuts out some of the more extreme swingy randomness from special play cards and the like. Losing some of the chaotic charm in the process, and ensuring that you can never quite live up to the examples set in all the DYKs and background.
- Licensing issues lost Thrud.
- Not really available legally. Why? Because GW hates GW fans.

This is a mechanically flawed game with excellent fluff and theme. Painting the figures is a joy. The length of a game often precludes table talk and socialization during play.

Blood Bowl is my current #1 game when played in a league format with the current living rule book. The game is a mix of Chess and Rugby with a fantasy theme. When I was first introduced to the game I thought it was okay but nothing great. I continued to feel this way until we started a league. As I started to develop my team the game grew into something much greater than the standalone game. When I wasn't playing Blood Bowl I'd find myself mapping out future skills for each player, the next purchase to make for my team, starting defensive setups to get the most out of the players on my team. We haven't stopped running a slow moving league since 2006. Although I don't play it as much as I would like to I probably still spend more time on this game than I do any other. My goal is to own every team.

Update: I moved my rating up to a 10 and I now own every team. This is my favorite game.

Ok so pretty much the same as third edition, more or less.  Great game.  Once players are all familiar with play I highly suggest playing with a timer.  We went with three miniute turns.  When the buzzer goes off you put your hands down and play passes - even if you've rolled the dice and are about to use or are using the results.  This really adds a lot of tension and forces play under 'clutch.'  Many games of this I've had using a timer I would easily rate as a ten!  

I have many teams and they are all well painted and have had many many games and tournaments.  Good stuff!  This is similar in many ways to Necromunda, except your managing a team as opposed to a gang.

I have only played a few matches face-to-face and played the computer game. So I know the gameplay, but not the fascination of managing your team and watching players becoming really good. 

The game is very tactical and offers different approaches based on your team's powers and qualities. But in the game you also depend very much on the luck of the dice. In combination with the harsh punishment that after a turn-over (like failing to pick up a ball in your half of the field) you are not allowed to move your other players, this is too much luck dependent for me to be a really good game.

Blood Bowl is American Football with Elves and Dwarves. It hasn't changed much over the editions, essentially players move and throw the ball while hitting each other with each side trying to score more touch-downs than the other. It can be quite fun but I definitely think of it as more a miniatures game than a board game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Very few games have captured my imagination over a longer period than Blood Bowl. Still one of my go-to games and one that I encourage other gamers to give a try. Glad to say that, living in Dublin, we still have an active group of players and have two different league seasons across the year (my glorious Dark Elves winning the playoffs of the 2014-2015 season!!!)

The levelling mechanisms give almost infinite variation to how individual teams will progress (though many common "power" skills will be prioritised). Every race plays quite different to the others - there are 4 Elven teams that all play completely different strategies. 

One thing players will not like in a season is injuries. It's a brutal sport, your players will get injuries that limit their abilities. Some will also die. Dice will screw you over (it's a well known fact that you will roll a double-1 9 times out of 10 when it's a vital roll! :) ). This is all intentional, and required, to stop teams just getting infinitely better. It also allows you to form a bond with your star players, and you will mourn them when they die or if you need to sack them. It's all part of what makes this game so good, you do get emotionally connected to your team!

The base game (if you can find it) has plastic orc and human team. The beauty in this game is getting a new team from one of the many companies sculpting and selling fantastic Bloodbowl figures of all the different races. Once you have a team, it'll be with you forever - and is always well worth painting. The LBR6 rules we've had for many years now are probably the best and most balanced they've ever been

So now, 20+ years after I got my first Blood Bowl team as a birthday present - I'm still playing and still loving the game.

I love Euro-Games and "Ameritrash" games, and have been playing games pretty much since my youth.  Blood Bowl (in a league format with LRB6/CRP) is by far my favorite game of all time.  Equally challenging, rewarding, and entertaining.  Playing the game well requires constantly adapting to your opponent's moves and your player's performances (much like "real" coaching, you can only call the plays but it's up to the players [the dice] to actually perform), while managing risk, space, and time.

Cheap to get into you (all you need is a team of 11-16 players!) yet plenty of room for expansion and hobby projects.  With over 25 official teams (factions) and lots of positions and level-up choices, tons of variability that is accompanied by a surprising balance.

Digital Edition at FUMBBL/Steam nowadays. Have run an online league for this for about a year now, and it's a great experience. People complain about the dice, but it's really a game about risk management.

The big thing with this game is that it's campaign length. This means not only do things even out long term as far as luck, but you also build an attachment to your teams. It matters when a favored player dies, or when you know you've removed a dangerous player from your league, one whose left a trail of bodies in his career's wake. Or maybe some rookie player trips and dies on his first game.

When played as an ongoing league with enough people, this game truly shines. It's addictive, nail biting, has a lot of tactics to learn and the building aspect of managing your team. Every game counts and you keep coming back for more.

It's not a perfect system and has a lot of randomness (risk management - basically the core of the game), but the system has been honed and balanced over many years, giving an even gaming experience (except if you roll a lot of those double 1's a lot!).

I think you need to have first been exposed to this as a young teen in order to truly love it.  Not a bad game, but it is long and random.  The game does give some great results, though.  With a couple lucky rolls (or unlucky ones) a turnover can lead to some exciting plays.  This is the kind of game that gives a few tremendously rewarding moments per game that makes it all seem worthwhile, you almost forget all the other wasted time, and frustrating die rolls.

The third edition is supposedly a little more balanced, and is set up to be more strategic by eliminating much of the carnage.  If a game is going to be called Blood Bowl it should have more blood.  I'd certainly play this again in a tourney over the course of a season, but if you are only going to play a single game for shear action, packed in the guise of a football game, I think that Battle Ball gives more bang for the buck.

UPDATE: Playing in a league means all the difference.  It is about managing you team playing for the long game, dealing with casualties, and working to make an overall better team.  This has all the joy of leveling up in D&D as you raise your stats in fun new ways, only now you are usually doing it after every session.

Blood Bowl is literally fantasy football - a combination of American football, rugby, and all-out war hashed out between orcs, elves, lizardmen, the undead, and basically every major fantasy race you can imagine. Brutal and hilarious.

It's already one of my favorite two-player games and I expect this rating to rise another point or two if I ever get a real league going here.

I played a maroon-and-white Wood Elf team called the Harvest Spirits in the PC version of the game and I'd love to reprise them on the tabletop someday. As it stands, I've got models for Skaven, Human, Orc, Lizardmen, and Undead/Necromantic teams. If I ever track down a second pitch, I'll be well on my way to hosting my own tournaments. :-)

Another game I grew up with, religiously playing 1st and especially 2nd edition during my formative gaming years. I still have a soft spot for it, and this edition is probably the best of the lot. The turn-over mechanic adds a lot of decision making to a game that was previously Warhammer with a football (1st edition) and a fun dice-fest (2nd edition).

Can only comment on my experience of this game through the video game versions, but from what I played the game is very fun. Only problems I have with the game are some of the imbalances between the teams and the sheer randomness involved. Not sure how you would limit the randomness except by giving each team more re-rolls, but besides those issues the game is very fun and thematic!

My # 3 most played game ever, the computer version and x-box version are great ways to teach and learn the game.  The miniatures and flavor in the rulebook really bring this one to life.  Best when played in a league.

LRB 5 is the best update for the game. Made the rules more balanced without loss of gameplay or fun. Special Play cards are an option for use and they add wackiness without unbalancing the game. I have been playing this game for over 20 years and it just keeps getting better and better.

Game is a solid 8 on it's own. Being able to play it in a league makes it a 9. All the refinement by fans since 1993 (3rd ed bloodbowl, which was base for the living rulebook) means 18 years of heavy streamlined development. 

One of the best games there is if you can find (at minimum) 3 others to join in and form your own league.

Oh btw if you look for some preformatted excel-sheets with which to run your league, send me a PM and I'll send them to you. Sorry, too lazy to strip away all the league details and add the templates to BoardGameGeek. Might do that sometimes, though.

Simple rules yet deep and engaging gameplay of strategic and tactical chaos mitigation that really lifts during campaign play.
Why did I wait so long to try this one out?

An easy 8. Campaign play lift it to a 9.

Bloodbowl is, for me, one of the best games Games Workshop has ever produced. It still carries the spirit, that make their games so interesing (interesting and slightly funny background, nice miniatures, great artwork, engaging gameplay etc.) but does not suffer from the drawbacks of their "main" games (it doesnÂ´t cost you an arm and a leg, it doesnÂ´t take the better part of a day to finish, it doesnÂ´t take a whole room to play etc.). To this it adds a much more accessible theme and a very motivating league-system (your players gain skills) .ItÂ´s a great game, even for many people that donÂ´t like other Games Workshop- or Miniature-Games.

Awesome flavor and story and a really great tactical boardgame.  A lot of people deride it for the luck involved but good play can mitigate a lot of luck and often the luck (bad/good) makes for the most memorable plays.  This game got me hooked into miniatures gaming and our league is now on it's second year.  Go Necrophiles!

Oh - Blood Bowl. Where to start? Maybe in the beginning: My first game of Blood Bowl in younger years against an experienced player started with me killing his precious Minotaur on the first move. Yeah baby - kickstart! If there were no other games in the world I would be perfectly happy painting Minis and playing Blood Bowl. Unfortunately there ARE other games... :)
Living RuleBook is a great thing to keep this hobby alife.
Played 60+ (I know I know - much to few!!)

Brilliant parody of the NFL combining a campaign system with a fast paced board game. Ogres throwing goblins for TD's may be the finest innovation in gaming.

The Living Rulebook is definitely one of the best expansions around, as it evolves and gets better as the immense player community continues to put Blood Bowl through its paces.

Any owner of BloodBowl should absolutely own a copy of this.

My plays so far have been hindered by playing against much more proficient opponents. I don't mind the losing, but taking so much longer to work out the factors involved in any given die roll has been a problem. Would probably be much more fun with someone at my level.

RATING: 8
Joined a league! Playing Wood Elves team called "Tranquil Treehuggers" with a team value of 1.170.000. In the not so serious league I've got a human team named "Kleindorf Pimplesqueezers", team value 1.230.000. This may be the best 2 player game ever. It has theme. It has fitting mechanics. It requires quick thinking since every turn has a time limit (4 minutes). The unexpected will happen quite often and soaked in blood and irony. If you play in a league it also got the addiction of a MMORPG since you want your players to gain new skills and become better. UPDATE: I'm rerating this to a 10 and lowering all previously rated 10's to 9's! This is such a great game! UPDATE: Lowering it to 9 again since rediscovering Advanced Squad Leader and other games. UPDATE: Just saw what an awfull thing GW did to GalakStarscarpers crown jewel. LRB6 is KING!

Strength of the LRB is it endures competition play. Still has the rules for one-off games, but majority of rules is targeted towards league play and persistent team management. Still a challenge to get one-time players past the size of the rules to return.

Commenting the LRB5+: I have not yet tried the league rules, but overall the rules seem to be good. There is no need to play with the original rules, there is so much more variation and possibilities with these rules without unnecessary added complexion.

Updated the rating to 8 after third play (and first league game), if you have the LBR then you should use it, if you play Blood Bowl. This makes the game much better, especially in the league format.

14 matches behind, no change for above.

Three+ full seasons played with LRB6, not many changes compared to LBR5+, so no change for the comments. :)

A priceless relic from a time where randomness was accepted as part of the challenge and fun. A time when game designers were not afraid to challenge players with significant adversity.

A brutal game of team building strategy, on field tactics with a high level of randomness.

An almost infinite skill cap with highly skilled players able to consistently win despite a game engine that on the surface would seem too random to allow this.

Unique to the point of being historically significant in the gaming landscape.

I wish I could rate this even higher. Football, "medieval"-fantasy races with role feelings and almost "chess" mechanics (you must to think to win regularly)and also die rolls and luck-dependant too, all in one!

It's more like rugby than football...and more like a gang war than a rugby match. There IS a ball, although it's way more fun to throw a goblin than a pigskin. Orcs, Elves, Dwarves and other fantasy mainstays playing football sounds ridiculous, and it is. But no other game has ever made me consider how much better the Cleveland Browns would be if they were allowed to bring chainsaws onto the field.

As a one-off game, Blood Bowl isn't great. There's a little too much randomness and the preconstructed teams are pretty boring. Get involved in a league however, and it's a completely different experience. Players grow more talented with each game they survive, injuries (and deaths!) are agonizing and the blandness fades away when you can pick and choose exactly how your team is put together. It's a fantastic experience.

The models cost a fortune and the base game is always going in and out of print, but if you can find it and not break the bank...It's awesome!

NOTE: This was recently released on the PC and X-box 360. The user interface leaves a lot to be desired...but it is a direct port of the board game with nine different teams. This is by far the cheapest way to get the Blood Bowl experience...not to mention the easiest way to find a game. Get it!!!!

Have played more than 1,000 games of Blood Bowl on fumbbl.com and it remains the best game I've ever played. It has everything I love: strategy both long- and short-term, an element of luck that can be mitigated by skill, unprecedented replay value, intense competition, humorous occurrences, you name it. The only problem was that I played it a little TOO much and had to cut myself off, though I look forward to the day I return to the pitch.

The Living Rulebook is awesome, and Cyanide's new Blood Bowl Legendary Edition is a very good implementation.

Blood Bowl truly is one of my favorite games, but I'm not into the miniatures hobby, and nor are any of my friends, so it never sees play in anything but a computer version (Cyanide or FUMBBL). However, I can only truly rate the game a 10 as I absolutely love it!

1/2/12 -- Rating 8 (LRB 6 [Competition Rules]):  Well, they seem to have pretty much figured out the correct set of rules by now.  The game is quite good, and the league rules are excellent.  Games can sometimes suck if you get off to an unlucky start but the game almost always has a great narrative and plenty of zany stuff happening and is worth a few laughs at the very least.  Definitely play with the turn time limit, and, once players have played once or twice, the Illegal Procedure rules as well.  After all, they're not optional...

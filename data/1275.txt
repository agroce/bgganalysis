Have only played a few of the scenarios and so long ago that it probably doesn't matter now.  Played a few times many many years ago.  Should get out again but other things get grabbed in preference.

WHAT THIS EXERCISE IS DOING IS POINTING OUT TO ME THE GAMES THAT REALLY OUGHT TO BE BROUGHT OUT AND PLAYED BUT WHICH NEVER SEEM TO SEE THE TABLE.  MAYBE THAT WILL CHANGE . . .

I enjoyed this game a lot when I was younger.  It was not as engaging when I played it several years later.  I wish the clues had more to do with the story accompanying each case, rather than being word puzzles or Clue-like deduction exercises. Maybe what I am looking for is in Consulting Detective.

RATING: 7
Simple, entertaining, recommended for ages 12+.  Nice way for parents to play a game with their kids that will get the kids thinking.  However, I think adults will find it too simple.  If you want a challenge, choose instead Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective.  Another issue with playing with kids is that the genre of Sherlock Holmes, you know ... gaslight, calabash pipe, Holmesian London, fog and mist, might be lost on them.  This is particularly so in the age where modern iterations of Sherlock Holmes, on TV and in the theaters, are more on the minds of the younger generation.

I used to play this game with my brother and sister and we enjoyed it so much when I was just a kid, here in Brazil this game is called Scotland Yard and was published by Grow. I love this deduction and investigation games and this one is a classic. The only bad thing and really bad thing about this game is that you move yourself with a dice, that's a very dated mechanic for moving arround the board.

Very similar to Clue, but with more depth as you try to piece together a mystery. We use the hansom cab variant (move 5 spaces or one of 3 cards that take you anywhere) and it eliminates dice rolling frustration. Our family are all Sherlock Holmes fans so that helps too.

RATING: 7.9
To give a good avaliation about a game, in my opinion, we should try to think about the game´s public target. If you think this game to teenagers, so I think we could up the rate. The worst problems about the game are the movement (a lucky dice can create a very contrastant campaign in this game) and a low level and few amount of complexity of many cases.

I have the first brazilian blue box. Another nuber of players (2-8) are mentioned on it and no the rules.

Recently started properly exploring games, and while I enjoy the clues to the game very much, for me there is too much luck in whether you roll a good amount to get close to entering a building, too much luck as to whether the route you take gives you useful clues or just several empty buildings in a row, and a fair bit of analysis paralysis when someone has to find and read and make notes on a clue.

I had this as a kid, but never really got into it.  It's interesting enough, but it's kind of random.  You really have to visit the right places to figure out the mystery.  Locks probably come more into play with more players, but they're not great with only two.  Nice little deduction game, but you have to play with honest players who aren't going to peek at the answers.

While the game may be a step up from Clue, the deduction element (which is fairly light) hinges on a D6 roll-and-movement mechanic. The end result is a game that feels less like a deduction game and more like a tedious chore where players hope to collect the necessary clues first.

RATING: 5
This detective game is sort of like Clue.  As you travel around, you get clues about the case that you're working on, with the goal of answering a few questions - often murderer and motive - before anyone else does.  It takes more thought and puzzle-solving logic than Clue, but the mechanics can make it a little slow.  If you want to feel like a detective, though, this is the game.

Board is way too large for the game. This caused several occasions where all the players spent 2-4 turns of rolling and passing the dice with no one reaching a location.  Also the distribution of the clues seemed completely random and there was no advantage to checking the locations mentioned in the scenerio.

Good game for those bored with Clue and want a litte more. Unique cases with new clues each case, usually based on simple word puzzles.  Ability to lock rooms from others mostly ineffectual as its to easy to get keys, and basically only serves as a bluffing device to make others think you found a good clue.

This game is a mental exercise but suffers from only being able to be played through one time, since it is essentially a 'choose your own adventure' style of game.

I have three of these bundled together, and only ever played through about 15% of the scenarios, because I continually fear that when the last one is read, it's gone.

This really isn't a very good deduction/mystery game, yet I find myself enjoying it anyway.  The gameboard makes for repetitive gameplay as certain areas are always investigated first.  The mysteries usually revolve around wordgames and not actual Holmes like deduction.  My wife and I pull it out about once a year and will probably keep it until we finish all 80 mysteries (we have the booster packs) or die of old age, whichever comes first.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
Totally lame.  No deductive element.  You just wander around collecting clues, which are individually meaningless, until you suddenly have each clue you need to solve the puzzle.  A worse experience than the canonical Clue, if that's possible.  Plus, once you've done a case, you know the answer and can never do it again.  Completely worthless.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Roll and move mechanic absolutely kills what could be a solid 5-6/10 family game here. Once you have all/a lot of the clues the game is actually quite fun (we eventually pooled together to solve it as a team, rather than race to the end), but there is no skill involved in earning the clues, you just need to move and collect them from each location. This makes the entire game feel completely arbitrary until you have enough clues to start working some out - which it is, to be honest. 

Would be happy to play the game as a pure co-op next time, so the tedium of rolling a one four turns in a row is minimised, as all the players split up to cover more ground and pool their resources to solve the mystery. I also think this type of house rule could make the difference between this being an easy, engaging family game as opposed to a roll-and-move, monopoly-style misery slog for some families.

I have the Gibson Game version with no expansions. This is really a Holmes-themed reworking of Cluedo with all of the corresponding benefits and drawbacks of that original game. The big bonus is a variety of cases to solve, each quite faithfully created in the style of a Conan Doyle mystery. I enjoyed it when I was younger. Bought it recently to play with my partner who is a big Holmes-fan but not so much into games.

By the theme, this ought to be a deduction game, but it's more of an exploration game.  You just go around picking up clues and eventually you know the solution to the mystery.  I'm particularly annoyed by some of the clues that don't fit thematically -- wordplay and such.

Hansen's Deluxe Edition. I love a good deduction game - unfortunately, this one falls a bit short. The roll and move gets a bit clunky, though it does feel thematic. Others have suggested using 2 dice to move things along. My biggest issue with the game was that it seemed that the person who stumbled upon the best combination of clues would inevitably win. Even in a scenario where one would visit the obvious locations (given the narrative) to hunt for clues, critical information would be found in random areas that seemingly had nothing to do with the story.

This game does offer some interesting cases, and requires that the player try to piece together disparate pieces of information to reach a solution.  Based on the casework alone I might give this a 7.  But I'm taking it down a couple notches due to the tired roll-and-move mechanic, and some of the clues that just hand you the answer (in parts).

Okish game to play now and then. Gets a bit repetitive after a while. The die can roll a low number, making it tedious as the game drags on. Would recommend adding a second dice to speed the game up as the singular die can make the game sluggish if ones are rolled constantly.

Components: Very minimal artwork; home-quality cards. The notepad is useable, and the clues booklet is at least bound, instead of loose leaf. But overall a homemade version could improve upon this.

Experience: The roll-and-move mechanism could be dispensed with altogether without harming the game. The one case I've played was actually interesting, with misleading clues, but enough evidence to come to a sound (though not certain) conclusion. If the production quality were higher I'd be much more eager to play this again.

Given the poor production quality, not sure why I prefer this any less to the also-poorly-produced Eagle Eye Agency, but I do.

This was fun when I first got it, but I have found better games. I think that I was taken in by the Sherlockian background to the game - the names, places, and such. After unearthing it in my games closet, I have been playing it solitaire, trying to figure things out with a minimum of clues. The early cases are not bad, but there are some lousy ones in the later sets: defecting Soviets? Napoleon behind a crime? Time travel? Jeckell's daughter? Give me a break! Also, in the later case sets, the cases become nothing but word puzzles (get the syllables and solve - no need for real thinking!). Finally, there are some severe errors that would have been caught with a minimum of proof-reading. 

If you want deduction in the time of Sherlock Holmes, try Sherlock Holmes, Consulting Detective.
If you want simple deductive reasoning, try Clue(do). If you want a more brain-teasing deduction experience, try Sleuth. This one is better avoided.

Found at Goodwill for $4.  Light roll-and-move clue gathering game.  I've only played one scenario so far and would have liked a little more challenge, but perhaps the later scenarios beef it up.  My wife and I did enjoy our time with it, however, and it was an excellent deal for only $4.

First you read a short story then you have to solve the puzzle. Who did what, with what, why, where etc. Different problems with different stories keep it fresh. You travel around London picking up clues that may tell you one of the answers or just point you in the right direction. There are a lot of additional cases available so this game will last a long time. Clue for grownups.

I have all 180 mysteries and I am working my way through them.   I like this for one simple reason...trying desperately to figure out the 3 clues and racing people back to 221B Baker Street in order to present the conclusion. It is great when you get there first OR even better, when someone else gets there first and blows it!!! With all 180 mysteries, this one can last a LONG time.

This was a thrift store find for $5. Better yet, it came with Set #2 and Set #3.I downloaded and printed the clue cards formatted for business cards. Using these along with the Hansom Cab variant eliminates most of the player downtime reducing playing time to 40-45 minutes a game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This game desperately needs a few variants to reduce the dependence on luck. Right now, dice luck determines how quickly you get clues, and the hansom cab is the only way around it. Also, the game could use some new mysteries with deductive-type clues, rather than "the animal that rhymes with the first syllable of the murderer's name"

RATING: 5
I own the pocket /travel version of this board game with magnet counters from Gibson’s Games; a small rules booklet and a few clue cards; very convenient.  The game is easy and plays smooth. The game contains 20 cases/puzzles to be answered. Each player wonders around London trying to find clues to solve the case. The first player to solve the case/puzzle wins the game. Easier said than done. The cases are tough nuts to crack. Even if one gets all the clues at hand it is difficult to give an answer as to what exactly happened in the case. You must either have lots of imagination or have read several books concerning the Sherlock Holmes investigations. After solving the case there is no replayability.

This game is painful to play. The idea is so promising, but the execution is awful as it is reduced to merely a race to find clues by a roll of the die. Too often you are just sitting there waiting for the cluebook as people are taking their turns before you and writing down the clues. There really is very little deduction in this game and lots of mindless meandering across a very ugly board.

Editions owned: 
- Hansen base game (20 cases)
- 2014 Gibsons base game (75 cases)

Second best of Holmes games.  Definitely worthwhile for mystery fans.  
Strength: the deductive and storytelling element.  
Weakness: the roll-and-move element.  I'd recommend playing with the [filepage=35237]Hansom Cab variant[/filepage]. Also some of the mysteries are better than others (the ones with basic rhyming style clues aren't as fun).  

Now that we're basically done all the original 20 mysteries, it's time to start the remaining cases of the 75 that come with the 2014 Gibsons edtion.  It could also be worth getting some of the expansions available here: http://www.toyandgamewarehouse.com/SearchResults.asp?Search=Baker+Street&Submit=

My favourites: 15. The Adventure of the Repeated Murder

Also own: [gameid=2511] - probably the best Holmes game, perfect for Sherlockian deductive thinkers.  1985 SDJ winner.  Recreates the atmosphere beautifully, with well-worked out mysteries to solve.  Works well solitaire.  Completed: Cases 1-2

RATING: 6
antiquated role and move mechanic that adds nothing to the game.  Interesting puzzle though the clues aren't very thematic.  Most of the clues are the sort of thing you'd find in a crossword puzzle such as asking for the sound a bee makes or a synonym for white.  They can be fun at times but they really don't have anything to do w/ the mystery  your trying to solve.  Despite feeling old fashion this can still be an ok game to pass the time.

221B Baker Street is a game from another era, and it has limited replay value. Each case has only one solution. Don't go in expecting the cases to feel like Doyle; they're easy to solve and absurd, the clues often relying on knowledge of a bygone popular culture or turning on puns. The central roll-and-move mechanism through which players acquire clues ensures that no one outpaces anyone else by too much. This generates artificial tension that puts dice in front of brains, but it can be fun if you're in the right mood for family fare. Be warned that the final tongue-in-cheek case sets are vastly inferior to the early ones.

Played with the house rule of 2d6 for movement rather than 1. 

Played this with the daughter (8) and she did OK. We played the simple version where we were the same team and basically she had to solve the clues. Locations are irrelevant as you need most of the clues to solve the mystery regardless of whether it makes sense in the scenario set up. 

Overall this is showing its age as some of the clues are a little outdated.

This has become a favorite of me and my wife. We both have a good chance of winning any particular game, and love the theme. [03-24-10]

I've downgraded the score a bit, as I'm finding the game is really more dependent on the luck of the dice roll, and the quality of clues really has little to do with where you go. Our more recent plays with the first case expansion has made this more obvious, and the quality of the case writing has gone down. Also: nuclear weapons in Victorian England? [01-09-12]

It resembles a little the stories of Sherlock Holmes but after one play it becomes boring because the cases, although different, use the same kind of clues. For a real Sherlock Holmes game try Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective.

RATING: 6
I remember always wanting to play this game, and never working out the answers before my dad won. I think the limited number of cases made it feel like it had to be rationed out specially - and replay value for each was obviously extremely low.

UPDATE

Was given a new copy of this for Christmas, upping number of cases from 40 to 75 obviously means less rationing, and is a lot of games when you have others to play as well.  Having played two games so far, the roll and move aspect is still a limitation, and with two players the lock and key mechanic doesn't add any strategy (maybe both players starting with neither would solve this?).  Still, accepting it's slight datedness the cases are well written and it's an enjoyably nostalgic and light game that I look forward to playing again.

Just purchased Ventura Games (1977), the Australian licensee of Hanson book-case edition (May 2006) ... brief skim through rules, "scenarios", clues, etc looks like it might be good fun.  Seems a bit scant on components especially the reliance on one booklet versus at least two in most other editions. Will update later.

UPDATE (July 2017): Finally broke game this out on a rainy week.  

Main issue, apart from well known issue about getting around the board using dice rolls for movement, is that the Ventura edition is that rules, clues and solutions are all in the same book; so unless everyone is acting "on their honour" multiple clues and / or results may "inadvertently" be seen.  

Well to somewhat obviate the die-roll to move issue (and speed up the mystery solving aspect)  the "house rule" we play is the basic movement rate of your token is 4 to which is added a 1d6 roll (so you can move 5-10 spaces each turn).  Also once you enter a location and look at a clue your turn ends is another "house rule". Another "house rule" is that if you land on a locations entry arrow you enter automatically if you wish to go to that location ... you do not wait on the doorstep till the next turn! Given the use of die-roll to move there seem to be no hard fast rules on how movement start and end works.

While the 20 Cases (scenarios) are on individual cards I would recommend against buying this "budget" Australian edition.  That said there are newer editions with more mysteries readily available nowadays.

My teenage kids, surprisingly, seem to enjoy this game ... so not a bad time filler.

My first inclination was to think of this as something akin to Clue. To some extent that's true, but in this case you must travel to different locations on the map and receive actual clues relating directly to the specific case you are to solve with details that build on the case summary presented at the beginning. Some of the clues I felt were bewilderingly obvious, and I solved the case after visiting only a few of the locations on the map. I played the original version of the game, so I don't know what the expansions may hold. I enjoy mysteries, even ones that seem a bit easy to me, so I think this game has potential. Based on that first experience, I'd be interested in checking out subsequent releases and expansions.

Well-written cases with that classic Victorian London feel. The only (minor) problem is the roll-and-move aspect that slows it down. My 10-year-old daughter loves to play this co-op: no rolling, we just go from place to place and sort it out together. It's her favorite right now.

Oddly entertaining.
Clue is the fundamental influence here, but there is a bigger mystery to solve than just who, with what and where. 
You still move a pawn around a board, and blocking someone from obtaining a certain clue is a viable option, but it's honestly unnecessary. We've played this game just by reading the initial mystery, and then individually gathering the clues by announcing where we intended to go on the board without actually moving there. It makes the game much shorter, and eliminates the mechanics of blocking and obtaining items to help you, but that really isn't a very strong aspect of the game.
The mysteries are what matters, and there's a surprisingly competent sense of the original novels about them. They are in NO WAY comparable to the mysteries you'll find in Sherlock Holmes, Consulting Detective, which is a much better game. If fact, Consulting Detective is one of the best games out there, but this little diversion is great for younger players and those looking for a little more mental engagement that what Clue has to offer.

Very interesting concept, but the game suffers from obviously outdated mechanics. Rolling a regular die for movement is just stupid. It's common to take three turns (more if you are unlucky) just moving from one place to the next. Also, many "clues" are in the form of (often ridiculous) charades with no thematic relation to the case being investigated.

This is not a game I should like. Mechanically it's terribly dated, with roll-to-move being the movement mechanism, a rulebook that somehow manages to leave things out despite the game having so few rules, and a relatively low amount of interaction between the players. But despite that... I'm a sucker for deduction games. And this game is really fun - IF you fix the roll-to-move.

So basically, use the Hansom Cab variant here on the forums (short version: you always move 5 spaces and you can warp anywhere you want 3 times during the game), and then just play away. And it's fun. It's really fun. Sometimes the clues don't line up, sometimes you get a case where there's only one location where you can get some piece of vital info, but ... it's still fun.

I can't help it. I like this game.

This was a good idea of a game (at least until you've memorized all the cases that is), but the roll and move thing has got to go.  My rating of the idea of solving the cases based on the clues would have been an 8 probably.  Moving by dice roll just needlessly slows the game down.  There's no purpose for it.

RATING: 8
Essentially Clue with actual cases and clues.  Fun game if that premise interests you, although I would recommend speeding the game up by rolling two dice per turn instead of one.  The game has a nice balance of being cerebral enough to hold the interest of wannabe detectives while being light enough to allow younger and less-cerebral players a chance at victory.

RATING: 5
Played this for the 2nd time (I believe) on June 7th, 2007.  It's a quick learn (5 min) and quick play (< 1 hr).  I played this as a two player game and it would probably be more fun with more players.  There seems to be weight on the luck side of the scale since you need to find the right rooms with the proper info and roll the dice to get to those rooms.  It's more complicated than clue which makes you think more so that's a plus.  I'd recommend giving it a game play if you like solving mysteries from clues.

Thrifted.  Deduction puzzle game where you race to locations to find one of 12 clues.  If you have the solution to killer/motive/weapon, you return to home base and declare your solution (if correct, you win: if wrong, you are out of the game).  Very limited replay as there are only 20 scenarios.  It may be possible that you will solve the scenario without even needing to get a clue.  Too hard for kids, too easy for adults.

Women's Aid charity shop find.
Quite fun deduction game. A step up from Cluedo.
Roll and move can make it drag a bit - we tried using 2d6 for movement to make it a bit more brisk. Maybe a fixed movement of 6 squares or something would work?

My folks enjoy playing this. We now play without the die. Players can move up to 6 spaces on their turn.

RATING: 2
I think deduction games suck.  There it's official.  Not that I'd say this game is a deduction game anyway.  It's more of a luck based roll-and-move game where the clues are laid out for you and you just hope to strike the lottery in the right locations to figure it all out.  I don't see much replayability in it either, but I don't really care seeing as I don't enjoy it in the slightest.  Dumb.

Hit or miss kind of game for me. I've done two cases, for one the solution seemed rather arbitrary and one of several possible solutions that fit the facts, the other was neater, but in turn a lot easier to solve. I really don't like the "sounds like" clues, but sometimes they are the only way to solve the case, which is annoying. I also don't like that you have to go to almost every location on the board to solve the case, even if it doesn't make sense to visit those locations in the context of the case. Also, the roll and move aspect is a bit annoying. 
That was a lot of negatives just now, but the game isn't horrible, just limited. Don't expect to much and you should be able to have a good time playing it.

Limited replayability as there are only 20 cases.  However, the game isn't even good enough to merit 20 playings in my opinion.  There is little to no actual deduction or puzzle solving.  Instead it is just a race of die rolls to move your pawn and find the "clues" which solve the puzzle.

deduction game.
clue-like in terms of roll-n-move to access clues

Scenarios are consumable (they could be replayable, provided one doesn't remember the clues or they can certainly be used by new players - ie not destructive as in a legacy system)
The clues are sometime puns, etc so is not "realistic" in terms of investigation

I actually like it. it's thematic and relatively narrative heavy.

CAVEAT : it can get a little downtime heavy and it is reading intensive (clues are verbose, etc)

I often see this going for next to nothing on ebay which is a shame as it's a very good light game. The game comes with 20 cases and lots more were made available, though the extra cases sell for a lot more than the game on ebay.

You move around olde London town picking up clues to the solution to the case. The clues are a mixture of trivia based questions and more cryptic crossword style ones. the game is a lot of fun and if you see it going cheap, get a copy. There sorted.

I really enjoy playing this cooperatively (no rolling, just choosing clues) with my mom. This edition has 20 cases, so playing three at a time (about an hour), still gives it some longevity. 

I've played Consulting Detective cooperatively as well, but found it more tedious than improved by the depth. Some of the hints and such are very basic, but again, with the 15-20 minute approach to a case, it was still fun.

Will probably not read the Weapon and Killer "Clues" in the future. They give too much away.

Excellent family game of deduction. Dice rolling is frustrating at times but you can orchestrate chances to win for younger children by not going for the solution first. Of course with adults it's much more of a pre-emptive strike competition. I like the clues, i like the game.

Enjoyable game. Basically, take Clue and kick it up a notch by adding the element of deduction using written clues rather than suspecting people and using process of elimination. Our second session wasn't nearly as enjoyable as the first, but mostly because we all felt the mystery wasn't as well written, so we're now suspicious as to whether or not the scenarios in the expansions are as well done as the original game.

Look, this isn't the greatest detective game, and after a few bad dice rolls it can feel like a frustrating game of roll-move-wait, roll-move-wait, but whatever, man - this is a Sherlock Holmes game that actually feels all Sherlock Holmes-ish, and it's a good one to pull out with family or friends who aren't used to managing resources or controlling territory.  In addition, the clues have just enough puzzle in them to keep things interesting, something that can't be said for a game like Clue.

I'm a major fan of mystery games and I'm always looking for games that steer completely clear of the Clue approach to mysteries. This puts mystery into an actual 'deduction' format by placing clues in relevant buildings. Easy enough for children but challenging for mystery lovers. Occasionally the randomness of the plot lines means for odd association and players have been known to get burned based on perpetually rolling a one. House rules concerning movement and a more liberal use of Scotland Yard cards can make for a more challenging game with less frustration.

Drug out this old classic from Dad's storage.  We decided to drag out some old games and make it a vintage game day.  Smells a little musty and Sean is allergic to mold so into the donation stack it goes!

Jogo razoável, alguns casos têm pistas interessantes, outros nem tanto. A mecânica de rolar os dados para andar pelo tabuleiro cansa depois que você conhece jogos melhores. O tema é o melhor desse jogo.

Opinião da esposa: Está entre meus jogos favoritos, embora as pistas deixem a desejar. Creio que eu as elaboraria melhor. Pistas em que é necessário cortar palavras sem relação alguma com a temática dos casos acabam tendo peso maior do que outras associadas à temática, que por vezes são falsas e enganam o jogador. Deixam, no final, a sensação de que se está jogando palavras-cruzadas e não um jogo de investigação.

Fun period-piece deduction game. The clues you can discover are well-written to allow you to formulate guesses without just giving the answer away (though occasionally one or two clues will be "keystone" clues that let you fill in the blanks). It's roll-and-move, and the board is a bit sparse, but that's to be expected from a game of this era (I mean, let's talk about The Game of Life...). The bigger blow is that there aren't more cases available; there are a fair number in the main box, and you can order more from the company that makes it, but until and unless they make more I have to hope my memory falters, or I won't get more than 30 or so plays out of it.

I really enjoy playing, but it is too much of an igo-ugo game.  There is almost no interaction at all with any of the other players.  They can only have the most cursory affect on you, by locking a door and then you have to get a key.  It is luck that you get the helpful clues.

This game is fun in terms of the theme, especially if you're on a Sherlock Holmes kick, as I currently am.   Once you've played through all the mysteries though, you'll have to get expansions or set it aside until you forget everything, so we tend to play it for a while and then put it away for a long time.  Also, moves a bit faster if you role 2d6 for movement -- not much fun to slog it through the streets of London 2 or 3 squares at a time.

I got this as a young child (about 5 or 6). We loved playing it all the way up until the 5th expansion set (Mind you my sister and I had no idea at the time that if Moriarity was mentioned in the card, then he did it).

We had a lot of fun, maybe I have rose tinted lenses but I am still very fond of this game. Crappy play mechanics and all.

RATING: 6.9
A detective game of course, you search the city of London for Clues after you read about the crime. The game is different every time so there are expansion packs available. Pricey. Some of the clues are not helpful or are red herrings so you need to use your powers of deduction if you want to make a guess. Much more brainpower and sophistication than Clue. It has really neat pewter pawns, all different like Monopoly. All the game components are very well made. Harder for small kids, it is too tough for my 8 year old son to guess who did before an adult, but he does very well at the movement and the gathering of clues.

A fine little game. I ordered a 2nd clue book as it can be quite tedious having to wait for others to finish finding, reading and noting down their clue (especially with anything more than 2 players).

RATING: 9
I really like this game! I think it helps that I have always loved solving mysteries and for a long time I seriously thought about being a detective! But, that aside, this game is very good and fun to play, because not only are there more obvious clues, however, there are also puzzle clues which use a little more thought. A feature which I love! (Despite me not being very good at it.) I must admit though, it is like pulling teeth if you play by rolling one die and moving, to get over this I play with 2 dice because you get around MUCH faster. I strongly recommend that you do not play with only one die!!

A good deduction game, very thematically pleasing. Though, of course, has the trouble any roll and move has when it comes to luck. I prefer to play co-op sometimes and just try to solve the mystery in as few moves as possible.

Bought this for my family.  I thought it was fun, but they decided it was inferior to Clue after the first play.  Thought it had been eaten by attic squirrels but it has been found and relocated to the family gaming shelf.  The clues that provide a letter in the name of a suspect are the least enjoyable and thematic part, turning the mystery into a game of hangman.

Played it with original rules and with variant rules taking out the roll-and-move element. It's fine either way, although without the roll-and-move it's so quick you barely feel like you've played a game. The cases are a bit thin. I don't really feel like I'm doing anything clever by piecing them together.

Great game of deduction. Not like clue. You collect actual text clues and must deduce the mystery. The more clues, the less you have to fill in yourself. Possibly, with every single clue, the solution is given. Otherwise, you must think it through. Great for those who like investigative deduction.

This game has a lot of sentimental value for me.  My family has been playing it on my birthday and at the holidays ever since my son was very young.  I am a Sherlock Holmes fan so the theme appeals to me.  The object of the game is to be the first to correctly solve the mystery (presented in story form) by collecting clues at various locations around London.  The main problem is the roll-and-move style of play; a lot of time is spent just getting from point A to point B.  Fortunately, people have posted some ideas on the Geek for speeding things up, and I intend to try these.  Another suggested variation involved zombies roaming the streets, which could be fun, too.

Probably can't be played with kids much under 13 as they won't be familiar enough with idioms and not cluey enough to puzzle out the syllable clues. On the other hand, once you get to that stage, it's too simple for much repeated enjoyment with adults and teenagers, with too much downtime passing the clue book around. The die roll for movement and the randomness of whether the places you go first provide good clues or not makes it a time passer only.

Having played again, it's a solid game.  If you must whine about the rolling mechanism, then have one person roll and all players use that same number.

As a sherlockian, I do enjoy this game for its theme and appeal. The "case" system is nice and makes this game quite replayable (until you solved the cases that is) and works better than Cluedo which relies on the randomizer. The game mechanics are as good as non-existens. You have to roll the dice and walk around the board. There are not a lot of other elements in the game, so what i comes down to is reading clues and solving the case. It can be a bit tedious, because there is only one die, and sometimes a few rounds consist of people rolling for the dice and nothing happens. Some of the clues are a bit difficult for younger people or non-English citizens as they refer to Literature, History, Poetry etc. I found that a bit frustrating, because should you not happen to know the answer, you have no chance of solving the case by means of deduction and logic.

Other than that, a fun game and my girlfriend enjoys it.

This is a game which draws you into the streets of Victorian London and is true to the spirit of the Holmesian "chase for clues" which is always afoot.  Expansion modules are required to truly keep the game fresh, but everyone who plays it seems to enjoy solving the riddles and patching together the standard detective framework of "whodunit", "how did they do it", and "what was the motive?".  A very entertaining exercise in riddle solving and route management to get to clues efficiently.

Used to play this when I was younger, but now the game shows its age - and my interests have also moved to other types of game.

Locking up places with the Scotland Yard cards was also nice. And finding out clues and conjoining them was a blast. It was one basis for my adult life filled with Mystery of the Abbey, mystery novels and the X-Files as an adult. So, please read my rating with a grain of salt: your kid might love this.

This is a fun game especially if you like "CLUE". More thinking is involved and it uses the rich flavor of the Doyle classics. However, it can be tedious to use a standard die in this game and luck plays a large roll, so my group incorporates a variant.... We use a d4 and add "2" to the result. This way even if you are hosed on the die roll you still get to move 3 spaces. And it is still enough randomness to shake things up occasionally! Overall, I enjoy this game if played in a quiet surrounding so you can enjoy the story.

This was one of my favourite games as a child. Essentially there is a description of a case, you then visit up to 14 locations in an order of your choice each with a clue about the case. The first player back to 221B Baker Street with a correct solution wins.
Elements of this are a little dated, it was published in 1975, but it is still a phenomenal game - a sort of highly immersive version of Cluedo.

There are a large number of cases available for this game, so replayability is high.  It is a mulitplayer game but can also be played by two.  The clues are a little juvenile much of the time and many times the theme of the clues are unrelated to the crime (example: "The opposite of long is ______." But as a game it still works and it has been a fun game for my whole family.

RATING: 6
Does a good job of capturing the feel of detective work, or at least the detective work of novels and films. Essentially the game involves picking bits of information, sometimes in the form of a poem (if I remember correctly) and then being the first to deduce who the murderer is. Fun in the right mood.

Kids game.  A good kids game- but I always think that this game could be better. The cards and books are a set number of cases and once done that's it.  The expansions are very hard to find in NZ so this game has a limited lifespan. I like mysterys - I have Clue(do), Mystery of the Abbey and Mystery Express, and I have yet to find the  best game.  I wonder if an adult variant on Baker St might be an answer.

I liked this game as a teenager mainly because it required an element of intelligent thought.Players travel around and collect clues, and for that they need some good dice rolling and luck to stay ahead of opponents.

This isn't really a deduction game rather a set collection racing game where you must run around and grab "clues" to "solve" the puzzle.  The illusion of solving a mystery works well enough while you are playing it.  Just don't think about it too much.  If you are going to play this, use two dice.  The game will go faster, and you will only get humped by the dice a few times. Still the player that gets luckier will win.

RATING: 6
Relatively simple, light deduction game. Similar enough to games like Cluedo to entice non-gamers to give it a go. 

The deduction elements do not unfortunately reward the best detective but the player who went to the right locations in the right order. For that reason the deduction is not very satisfying. Also the 'roll and move' mechanic is difficult to swallow for those who have played a lot of other games who handle this more elegantly. With that said, it is a mechanic familiar to non-gamers and so has that benefit.

Not a game I would suggest but I game I would play if someone else suggested it, particularly someone who would not be as comfortable playing other games.

This game is usually at the butt-end of a joke when you go to a gaming convention, but it's not really that bad. We played it quite a bit when it first came out, and at the time there just wasn't much like it. Obviously once you play a case the replay of that one is pretty much nil. However, the game has good interaction and the cases can be quite interesting.

Better than Clue! 

Fun with 2, but I could see this being only tolerable with 3, and unbearable with more. There is 0 player interaction of any kind, and since a the time spent privately looking up clues is the only real time factor this would long and very boring with more. 

We read the rules once and immediately decided that 2 dice would be better than 1, and then switched to a D20. Very glad we did so. Unless something can happen "on the street" there is no point in grinding along trying to get from the Docks to home.

The narrative of the cases is the game.

It's a unrepeatable game. Once you play all the 20 cases and you are done. It does provide extension up to 180 cases, but you get my point. Also the roll-and-move mode seems a little redundant to this game. But the stories are good.

Before the time of my board game Enlightenment, I bought 221B Baker Street for a buck or two at Goodwill along with a small pile of other games so my students could have some bits and pieces (and boards) to use when making Edgar Allan Poe-themed games. 

I don't know if I feel worse about destroying this game for semi-academic 9th grade arts 'n crafts or for contributing to the perpetuation of the "roll and move" mindset. 

At least by the time my 11th/12th graders were making Catcher in the Rye board games, I just gave them poster board and dice.

Theoretically a lovely game. 1d6-based movement is a little slow, but keeping the dice going round the table whilst people read clues kept the action up. Have only played case 1 (of a friend's set) and was dismayed by the required sole clue to the murder weapon being in an utterly illogical place.

My daughter and I had a good time playing this. We were able to keep things moving pretty well, but I could see there being a lot of downtime with more than 2 players.

This is like Clue, only so much better!

1) It has a Sherlock Holmes theme.
2) It doesn't have NEARLY as many spaces between rooms, so you aren't taking 4 or 5 turns to get to a nearby room, like Clue.
3) The solutions are in a book so 2 people can play this!

Because there are only 20 cases (games) in the box, you might think that's it.  Au contraire!

You can get additional books of 20 games for cheap.  I found and ordered 4 additional packs, which means I have 100 cases/games!

Lots of fun!

Light a pipe and pour a glass of brandy; 221-B Baker Street is the boardgaming equivalent of a mystery novel.  It's about as exciting as that sounds, and the game grinds to a halt while each player reads the clue book.  It's not bad for a 35+ year old design, and the quality of the writing is pretty good.  A new version with proprietary dice, a different board, and multiple clue books might sell very well.

Pulled this one out of my old game collection now that I'm a reborn boardgamer. It suffers greatly against newer game designs. There are a few things broken about the game. The roll and move mechanism is clunky and makes it boring; the Locksmith and Scotland Yard cards are next to useless; lots of downtime while players write down clues from the book; and replayability is limited to 20 cases (in the original game). Expect rating to decrease with additional plays.

I love the idea behind this game. The game does a pretty good job of delivering. I would like if the clues were a bit tougher and if all of the clues actually related directly to the story, instead of clues like "another name for a violin." 

I want a quicker, more accessible Consulting Detective, but that is not what the designers intended. It is meant as a family game and I think it succeeds.

As others say, give up the dice and use one of the many diceless variants.  I personally prefer the rules posted in the files section that is not only diceless, but has alternative carriage rules.

The stories do a good job setting the mood and the game really is enjoyable on a rainy evening when you feel like a little Victorian-era sleuthing.

Update: Rating down from 7 to 6.5. 4 more plays and still enjoy this, but I think think the original rating came from a few years ago when I was a bit less critical. I am still happy to own and play this and will some day complete all 180 cases I own.

The moving around the board gets tedious, and the placement of the clues involves too much luck.  The best clues aren't always where you think they will be, and the non-puzzle clues can be downright misleading, so if you want to be safe you have to just fish for the puzzle clues which are easy to figure out.  The game plays much better, in my opinion, if you forget the board and just read the story and try to figure it out.

A more adult version of clue as you go around the board trying to solve the case.  Visit various parts of the boards for possible clues and once you believe you have solved the case, get back to 221B Baker street to confirm.

Well I got to play this finally and the game was cool. The case we played had some very subtle nuances that made it fun to dig into. You need to pay attention and make sure you get all the information afforded you on your visits to locations. Not a bad little game.

I also have expansion #2 - #9 (I think that's all of them.) I will almost certainly never play all these 180 scenarios before I die (gruesome thought.) Then again, I'll likely not play more than half my other games before then either!

Have played the first two scenarios and this game is GREAT! I love how the clues come out gradually, and everyone is racing for that one missing bit of information. So far, the stories and clues have been very tight. I'm so glad to have found this game and all its expansions. (Shellie is really good at this!)

This game is so close to be being perfect (when playing with the Hansom cab variant found on the game's page). It's a huge let down that so many of the "clues" are word problems, and not at all linked thematically to the story. Someday I want to re-write the clue book so that it will be more awesome for everyone (but then I won't get to play it).

Prefer Cluedo.  Clues are often not clues, just answers to the puzzle.  No player interaction and it can take a while for the last player to finish with the damn clue book!  Nice dinner party type puzzles tho.

I'm not totally sure what to make of it. The roll and move is pretty lame. Rolling two dice and adding them makes the game go faster and takes some edge off the luck. Putting the clues together and solving the mystery is pretty interesting. You don't get quite enough information to figure out everything, so some leaps of reasoning are required. I'm not sure where the game is, though, as it's just a race around the board.

A fun mystery game. Find the clues, see through the red herrings, block your opponents, and solve the case. Movement slows the game down big time but there are variants to fix this. I prefer these mysteries to any of the CSI or other newer crime games.

(One play) An interesting roll and move game. It was quite good fun, as we played it very frantically, rolling as soon as the previous person had rolled. Not bad for the occasional play, but there doesn't seem to be any skill involved.

RATING: 6
Very cool theme with a lot of replay ability. The game has something like 40 unique cases for detectives to solve with even more available as an expansion. Some of the clues that you rely on to solve the cases are a bit dated or specialized which can be frustrating if you've got the clue but you can't work out what it is. Still a fun roll and move detective game.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Theme was great, the scenario was nice, the gameplay was 30 years out of date (we played a half a dozen fixes for that, and even still it needs more).

I guess I'm ok with the idea of this game, but not while it's playing like Clue Advanced with some word game thrown in for good measure.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
This game rides on theme.  The clues are actually usually small little trivia questions, but they are rarely particularly difficult.  The game itself revolves strongly on luck, as there are a lot of red-herring clues, and it's complete guesswork which locations will provide the 'real' clue.  This one's a bit more atmospheric than [gameid=1294] though it's not got the logic component to it that one has.

Fun game the first few play throughs.  The first play through you realize that some of the clues are either a play on words or something similar and it feels like it's meant for children.

RATING: 5
This is a decent enough game in the way that the clues slowly reveal the mystery.  Which places you visit determine which order you receive the clues, and it takes some careful connecting of the clues to solve the mystery.  Unfortunately, the die-rolling part of the game can make it a frustrating race, when all players know the solution, but can't make it back due to crummy die rolls.  Still, the mysteries are interesting enough, and even if there are only 20 plays in the game, that still comes out to less than $1 for each adventure.  That's worthy, I think.

Players travel around London gathering clues to solve a mystery. The clues lead to needed answers such as what is the name of the murderer, where are they located, and what was the motive for the crime. The clues are of a crossword type, and they try to fit into the mystery story. The concept is solid, but the puzzles were not my type -- I couldn't get any of them.

(1 play) Clues made little sense until right at the end (& even then some were weird).  It felt strange playing a 'roll and move' mechanism after so many games without it, and it's definitely not something I have missed!

RATING: 6
Picked up the Deluxe Edition by Hansen (with 200 cases). Never played this back in the day, so it was all new to me. Fun, but a bit silly and luck-based. I think we're going to end up playing this cooperatively, as racing around (we use a 2d6 for movement; 1d6 seems insufferable) just isn't that fun, while puzzling through the clues is.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
Horribly disappointing.  The game sets up a nice mystery and half of the clues provide deductive leads and fill in the story nicely, exactly as a Sherlock Holmes game should.  Unfortunately, the other half of the clues give crossword puzzle-like hints for the syllables of the suspect's name, their motives, etc. completely ruining the atmosphere and any chance at clever deduction.  There's no point in trying to think at all--just race from room to room, get the clues that spell out the names of the answers you need, and race back.  Boring.

It's a quirky, more intellectually-stimulating version of Clue that my little sister loved to death in the late 80's. Still have the bookcase version (my sister grabbed the long yellow box version we had as kids), and won't hesitate to break it out if some non-gamers come over for some light entertainment. Easily the best "traditional" boardgame I own.

A great deduction game, however it can sometimes come down to luck if the die rolls just don't go your way. Also the bookshelf version only comes with 20 cases, and you'll have to wait a few years to forget them enough to really gain any replay on them.

RATING: 6.5
The only problem with this game is the movement mechanics. We replaced the original one with 2D6 dice roll and the investigator uses the biggest number from the 2. Also the blocking evidence mechanics sucks. Use the Orient express one: each investigator get 3 chips numbered 4, 5 and 6, they can leave any of the chips on any place. When an investigator arrives to a place with a number on it rolls 1D6. If the number on the die is equal or bigger than the number on the blocking chip, he/she reads the clue and discards the chip, if it is smaller replace the chip for another one, 1 number smaller. E.g.: There is a chip of 6 at the Hotel. An investigator tries to enter the hotel by rolling 1D6 and gets a 3 so he cannot enter and the chip is replaced by one with the number 5. If the investigator tries again on the next turn and fails  the chip is replaced by another one 1 number less until he succeeds or the chip is number 2 in which case it is removed from the board.

Also the mechanic (from the orient express) of getting information from another investigator is great, so in order to do the same here when we fall on a space with another investigator in it roll 1D6. On 5 or 6 the other investigator has to give you a clue of your choice from the ones he possesses. He mentions the places visited and you pick one place you do not have and check the clue as if you have just visited it.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.7
Though this game uses die-rolling to determine movement, seemingly more out of it being traditional than because it makes sense for the game, 221B Baker Street is a pleasant game.  Players use clues - some delightly vague and realistic; others specific, like in the cheaty sort of charades (e.g. "the third letter of the killer's name is G") - to figure out the different aspects of the crime themselves.  Some cases may only require few aspects to be figured out; others, many.  Each case is presented as a narrative, which ends in a specification of what the players need to discover, as well as a declaration that "the game is afoot," of course.

One really nice element of this game is that you can have Scotland Yard mark a location, which you're leaving, off-limits to the other players unless they utilize a key to unlock it.  This is a great way to protect key evidence.  It's an even greater way to waste people's time in a bluff, by protecting a location with no evidence.  Especially using the inexpensive expansions with more cases, this game has pretty decent replay value.  The game itself will feel about the same, but snooping around for clues will take you to different places, and always have you sussing out the solution to the mystery!

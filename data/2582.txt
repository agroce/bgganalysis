Far too luck based.  At least Taboo requires a little bit of skill and thought.  This one is just mindless in comparison.

Actually quite a fun party. I do agree with some comments that you need a group with a similar reference or it can be hard to guess. The other issue I've noticed is that many people have trouble reading the small print found in earlier versions.

RATING: 5
When you need a social activity for a large group of people to engage everyone in a game, Catch Phrase works. Word association. Taboo has the extra wrinkle of listing words you *aren't* allowed to use in getting others to guess the word in play that makes the challenge a little more interesting, though.

RATING: 5
It's a pretty basic timed guessing game. I'm actually far less inclined to play it than my rating would suggest because (at least for the electronic version), the set of clues is so small that after a few games (maybe 20), we started seeing repeated clues.

I really don't like that it all basically comes down to luck. You can be as clever as possible and zip through the words, but if you just so happen to be the one that gets the buzzer when time is just running out, it doesn't matter. You still lose. The person before you can take 60 seconds to get through a word, but as long as there is still a second left, you are the one that loses.

RATING: 9
The original electronic version is one of our all time favs for quick and relentless fun.  A little duct tape over the speaker makes the beeps a lot more tolerable.  The newest edition is a real bummer with harder "phrases" that consist of 2 words that don't traditionally appear together.  The old one is the way to go if you can find it... or even the old paper dial version.

RATING: 7
One of my favorite party games.  I love coming up with clues for my teammates as the "ticking time bomb" beeps faster and faster.  Still have fond memories of playing while camping (keeping the campground awake, I'm sure) and coming completely unglued upon witnessing the following exchange:
{Word=orange}
Clue:  "A color that's also a fruit."
Response:  "Banana!"

[i]Posted: 11/27/05, Rated: 6[/i]

Feels like the result of a mad coupling between "$64,000 Pyramid" and "Hot Potato," that works surprisingly well.  The challenge is finding the common ground that you share with your teammate(s).  For example, a married couple will do a lot of "Oh, this is what happened when we went on vacation, and saw that guy..."  A teenager might not understand the clue, "The luck of the ..."

[i]Catch Phrase[/i] is a fun party game that can draw bystanders into it.  While playing over the holidays, people in the other room who didn't want to play would shout out clues if a team was having problems.  Those interlopers were quickly whipped with a green bean and then recruited into the game.

I don't see it being as much fun if played repeatedly with the family.  It could be a "situational seven" when played with the right group of people.  Otherwise, it's a 6.

Party game silliness. A very simple Charades/Hot potato style of game where you give clues to your partner and then pass the clue giving device to the other team, Whomever is holding device when the variable timer goes off loses the round and the other team gets a point. Fun, sweet spot is clearly 4. I have the old non-electronic version.

If I am with a big group of non-hardcore gamers (like my family), this is the game we will play.  It is an excellent party game, and a kind of cross between hot potato and Taboo.  It is fast paced, and everyone is involved.

RATING: 7
I have only played with the electronic version, but I really like it that way.  It's just a lot of fun playing this game that is a combination of hot potato with a bit of Taboo.  It works exceptionally well with our youth group, and really helps them to work together.  The best part is that there really isn't an upper limit for the number of players, so you can play this with so many people and still have a good time.

Unfortunately there are some drawbacks to the game as well.  You really need an even number of players so that you can alternate teams in a circle.  The other issue is that, with a large group, it can get difficult to remember who is on your team.  This can be fixed if you have an equal number of boys and girls, but getting a perfectly balanced group like that is easier said than done.

With the right people and right environment, Catch Phrase can be a blast. 

The only time I every intentionally try to play Catch Phrase is with kids from my youth group when we're driving on a bus or sitting and waiting for something. In that environment it's phenomenal.

When I'm sitting with people around a table playing games, there's almost always a better choice though

I have been loving this game since it came out, and EVERYONE I play it with loves it, too. The original version has a nicer "look" than the new version, but I played it so much I started to inadvertantly memorize the word order on the cards! The all-in-one electronic version solves that with 10,000 words... and it's so easy to take anywhere.

I also found the original to be a little on the delicate side. In the heat of play people want to slam the button to get the next word, which would sometimes spin the disc a little too far, and you'd be stuck between words.

An interesting password/charades style party game with a "Hot Patato" type victory condition.  Like a lot of party games there's serious room for ambiguity and someone using "gamesmanship" can throw off the game (waiting until the last second to pass the disc, etc).  But for an occasional light, social experience it's kind of fun.  The incessantly increasing beep from the timer gives it a little bit of an edge.

Components: The standard edition has a usable word-generating paper disc inside the hot-potato mechanism. The first electronic version, which combines the score track, the timer, and the word-generator into one contraption, is much sleaker, but not as easy to use in the rush of gameplay, and lacks the satisfaction one gets from slapping the side of the original version to advance the word wheel. The newer electronic version has a more intuitive interface and does away with the annoying talking points allocation.

Experience: Once one of my favorite "guess the word" games, with players frantically shouting out clues and trying to pass the gizmo along as quickly as possible. However, there is no real continuity from round to round, except for a somewhat mounting tension. A great game, but I've played it waaay too much.

Smart team guesses word in seconds, then hands 'hot potato' to dumb team.  It takes dumb team 20 times longer to guess word, then they hand it back to smart team with .3 seconds left on timer....BZZZZZZZZZ.  Dumb team wins again!!!  

Winner NOT determined by skill, unless of course the dumb team is so dumb that they can't even get a single word.  Might as well play hot potato and skip out on all the extra, worthless crap.

We have both the blue and white electronic version -- which is good and seems to be better than the 'newer' version because it has a greater variety (and seems to be very reliable) --- and the original manual version which works surprisingly well.  Picked up the latter at a thrift sale and will be keeping both of them.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This looked interesting when I saw others playing it, and I'm glad I tried it, but I don't know that I feel much urge to play it again.  It's a bit similar to Taboo, except that I like Taboo a thousand times better.  I'd rather have the target be a word than some phrase that people may or may not be familiar with.  And the forbidden words in Taboo add challenge and make it more interesting.  This is something you can do with a big mob of people paying varying amounts of attention.  I prefer to get serious with my party games.  Catchphrase is Taboo-esque enough that it'll always remind me of Taboo, and I'd always rather play Taboo.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.9
Not the best word game. Taboo's better.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This is a party staple in our house; the combination of Guesstures, Taboo and Hot Potato is a guaranteed hit with a larger group. There's almost no player downtime, and everyone really gets into the guessing. It's most fun with groups of people that know each other really well. However, Catchphrase can wear a bit thin if played for too long at one time.

[b]Update:[/b] Dropped from a 6 to a 5. With Say Anything,  Wits & Wagers and Attribute available, this one has been lost in the shuffle. I'll still probably bring it out for larger groups of 8+, but with fewer people there are more involving and fun games out there.

Also, it's become quite common to run down the clock. This is legal and strategic, but it ruins quite a bit of the fun people are having. For such a light game, it isn't worth the effort to house-rule anything.

A little heavy on the "Americana" for the kind of International crowd I often find myself in. People seem to enjoy this a lot though, and because it's easier, it ends up being a lot more exciting and fun than Taboo. 

It's the most played of all the party games I own because it's the most portable and because of how popular it is with the masses. Problem is that it's hard to keep it an even-numbered group. 

I, however, would much prefer playing a game of Taboo, but only if the crowd could handle it.

Me and my girl recieved this for Christmas.  Ever since then, anytime there are six people around we have pulled this game out.  It's great for bragging about how into each others brains you are, without really bragging.  Each time we have played, there's alot of laughing involved, and the feeling you get when the timer starts ticking faster and the disc is handed to you is pretty great.  The game gets a lower rating from me since you can easily burn through all the word disks.  But I still wholeheartedly recommend this game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Good game with the right people. Have to agree on rules before playing. 
Also, if player object to the timing aspect of the game, as it makes scoring more random, you could agree to play for points (clue words until time expires, one point per word), like Taboo. The Hot Potato aspect of this game gets a little more annoying each time I play it.

RATING: 7.5
This is an outstanding party game.  It is hot potato or "Pass the Bomb" with words and phrases. 6 players provide a good starting energy and the more the better. We have often played with just 4.  Can be humorously embarrassing when players don't know the phrase or words, however, communication frustration and efficiency is part of the game.  Kids below 15 will be stumped more than 20% unless they are very well read and knowledgeable; in which case I recommend the "Kids Catchphrase."  Get the electronic version and sit in a circle with alternating teams for best results.  Having a large vocabulary is helpful.  The entertainment is the attempt at communication and conveying ideas and having fun doing it.  It underlines the uniqueness of our own personal perspective and what we see as obvious connections often really aren't.  We shouldn't play more than two complete games in a row though.  A great game to have for large groups.

In this 2-team party game, players will pass around a plastic circle that gives clues they need their team to guess. Using words, sounds, gestures, etc, a player will try to get his team to say the clue. The electronic version is much better than the old one, eliminating the need to change cards (especially mid-round) and the completely unnecessary board.

There is not as much room for creativity as the Apples to Apples type of party game. Even in its genre, it requires a lot less thoughtfulness than Taboo. Skill is downplayed because of the very random "hot potato" mechanism. If it scored like Taboo (points for how many you get right, rather than "other team gets a point if you have it when time runs out") it would reward player more appropriately. As it stands, it can't really be played super-competitively.  However, the freedom to give clues with hand motions, sound effects, and virtually anything else that most other games restrict is a plus.

The time pressure does create funny situations and players will find themselves laughing as they struggle to come up with clues while time winds down. Given its portability and accessibility, it's worth keeping around as party games go, but it's not the best of the bunch by a long shot.

If i'm rating this an activity it would get a reasonable rating. I have fun working with a partner trying to get them to say something and honestly don't mind a time limit. As a game though the hot potato aspect while suspenseful, makes for awful gameplay. The best team can rifle through answers in 3 seconds while another struggles for 20 seconds. It doesn't matter, the team that scores is the team not buzzed by the buzzer. This also leads to a meta game of good team purposely taking time off and handing the buzzer to a slow team near the end. I don't want to trash this game, but i really don't want to play it

A great party game that involves describing a word and passing a disk.  Teams alternate until the time runs out.

Lindsay loved this game so much she claims it's a ten. I think that's a bit (way) too much but it is a fun word guessing game that can be played with about as many people as you want.

Think "password" crossed with "hot potato"... This is always the biggest hit at every game night we have. It is fast-paced, exciting, and tons of fun. Personally, I like some other "password" games better (like Taboo), but the pure energy generated by this game is hard to ignore. Definitely a must-have party game!

A lot of fun - like taboo, but less thinking because there is no illegal words.  Also, everyone gets to play because you are constantly passing the potato around.  Best party game.

RATING: N/A
Two common house rules: 1) If you get stuck for a clue, you're allowed to pass and try to describe the next item.  All you lose is time.  2) There's no penalty if you accidentally use part of the answer in your description--just try to describe the next one.

RATING: 5
A cross between Hot Potato, Taboo, and "Charades light," and surprisingly good. The electronic version is handy, and although the timer noise is insanely annoying at first it becomes less so -- and more part of the fabric of the game -- as you play.

This falls into a similar category as Pass the Bomb for me, with the added benefit of involving teams and being more accessible for folks who fear word games.

Great party game because it can be scaled to accommodate just about any number of people.  The only reason it's not a '10' is because I will generally get tired of playing this after numerous rounds and everyone wants to keep playing.  (I guess there could be much worse problems in the world.)

RATING: 2.5
Game in a Nutshell: Play hot-potato with a devise that spits out a word you have to try and get your team to guess.

Played as: 8 player

Pros: Has a gadget factor that's sorta cool, and the little beeper that speeds up as your running out of time will get the blood pumping.

Cons: I guess there's a whole genre of "guess what I'm trying to describe" party games and this one has to be the worst of the bunch due to the hot-potato effect. There's nothing really fair about when the buzzer goes off, you may as well flip coins to a certain extent. Way too many obscure things pop up and I have no idea what or who it is. The game may be exciting, but 'exciting' forget to call 'fun' and ask him if he wanted to come over.

Best Use: White elephant gift?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A great social party game. Usually willing to play it, though it is only fun in large groups (6+) and does become a bit rowdy and disorganized with significantly large groups (probably around 12+) and the teams have to be even unless you find a way of adding in an odd player. Because of these limitations this game is getting a 7, though once a group is available (a group of course social and interactive enough to be fun to play with) this game is a blast.

Game is like a speeded-up version of the TV show Pyramid. Great game; but the words rarely, if ever fit into the categories provided; making the game a bust, and not much fun.

RATING: 6.5
Taboo on wheels, and still a ton of fun.  Like a lot of party games, Catch Phrase is dependent on the group and size of the group.  The larger and more casual the better.  An excellent game for non-gamers, especially those whose eyes roll into the back of their head when you whip out Settlers of Catan.

I own the electronic version and I love the fast pace of gameplay. I also dig the fairly open interpretation of the rules. Wonderful for a big group. Absolutely hysterical to watch and participate. We gave this game as a gift last year to all our friends. The only drawback is that we've seen most of the words/phrases now that we've played over 50 sessions, but that's to be expected.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
My ranking on this non-electrical version is because of the cumbersomeness of the components. It got just a few plays when we got it a decade-and-a-half ago, because we didn't really like the set-up. However, a few years later, we got the electronic version as a gift and our desire to play this game went way up. I give the electronic version a 3x higher ranking (a "6" instead of a "2"), as it is an excellent party game.

So, at this point, only the electronic game should be considered/used. Ever.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
A fun game in the same vein of "Password" and "Taboo." The added timer adds a "hot potato" element that makes the game more exciting and frantic. A good game for high energy and interaction. A good, light party game!

2nd Edition white and blue bought at Target $22.  My sister has 1st edition which is light grey and blue.  Difference as far as I could tell is the buttons and also has a blue backlight so it's easier to read compared to the first edition which doesn't have a backlight.  It has 10,000 words/phrases and not sure how many the 1st edition has.  It's fun to play with family members...wouldn't suggest pulling this out at game night though.

Yes, it comes down to luck and how difficult your phrase is, but its part of the fun.  The ability to do pretty much anything to get your team to guess the word opens up plenty of possibilities and gives this game legs.

RATING: 4
This is a big hit around quite a few of my friends. It is an okay game. I prefer a bigger challenge like Taboo where you are restricted on how you may communicate and don't quite care for the 'hot potato' mechanic as it seems like luck determines victors. Despite this, the game is still fun as a short filler.

This is pretty good with the right group. I've never been a huge fan of it because so often I get stuck on teams with the person who sees his/her word and just sits there: "Oh, I don't know how to describe this!"

Most other team party games that I play (Cranium, Outburst) seem to have built in flexibility for awful teammates.

This was a SUPER FUN game.  We played it with a large group of 15 divided into 2 teams and sat with players from each team sitting alternately.  The beeping clock inside ticks faster as the random timer is about to go off, and it makes you CRAZY nervous!!!  Prepare to have heart rates go up and to be completely exhausted at the end of it just from fear (or anticipation) that the electronic device will go off in your hands!!!  It was great fun to play this and try to convey the words/phrases to the rest of your team.  Will DEFINITELY play this one again... just SO-SO-SO much fun!!  :)

Its really fun with a group of 4-20. I don't say that about most party games. I don't know any other games that can play this many people either.

I have and far prefer the non-electronic version.  Well, the timer is electronic, I guess. I prefer this version as its easier to track progress, just get the most sober person to run the board.

This is just a great party/drinking game.  It just gets better with more alcohol. I have played this all night drinking and having a great time

*Have the manual version and electronic*

RATING: 7
Like a hot potato / charades / description game. Basically, there is a word or phrase that must be guessed, you can do anything or say anything except the phrase itself and once your team guesses you pass it on to the other team. You do not want to be the team in play when the time runs out. The electronic version is much better and the game is fun. But like most party games, you get fed up after a while. There are a lot of clues (1000 in the electronic version) and you can choose the category. Better then most party games.

The perfect party game for non-gamers. Very portable. More than any other game I have, this is the one friends request at a party. Outburst is the perfect companion to this as well.

The premise of this game is OK but soon you realize that where the ball drops, so to speak, is TOTALLY random. It really doesn't matter if you try or not, the outcome is totally based on when the buzzer happens to go off. With a group of non-gamers in a goofy mood this game can be fun for about the first 20 minutes.

Great party game that require no table space, scales well to any even number of players.  The Electronic version is much easier to read and has the bonus of being able to play by categories, but seems to have more difficult words in it, making it tougher to play with a mixed ages/education group.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Definitely a favorite party game of mine, its a lot of fun to pass the electronic version around like a hot potato.  Of course, it helps a lot if your team is good at guessing and giving clues, so it can sometimes be tough for players who aren't good at that.  But a lot of these style party games have that drawback so...

Very similar to Taboo, this game really only works with the right group of people.  The idea isn't original, but if there's enough competitiveness and vigor with the players, it can be fun.  The "hot potato" idea of passing around the word disc can ramp up energy but also cause needless problems.

This is a hard one to rate, as I don't consider it a board/card game really, but a word game. I guess word games are games too, but they don't rate up well with what I have in mind for games. I gave it an "average" rating, although I do like the game. Its like Taboo, but you just can't say the one word or phrase the your trying to get others to guess.

Yet another party game where one person is placed at the center of attention and must then perform for the amusement of others.  That this one involves spouting off a nearly steady stream of words might help it a little.  Probably not, though.

Less like a game and more like a fun experience.  Silly ticking word bomb adds tension, but if you get it and it goes off before you can even read the question, and give the other team a point there really isn't a game here.  Regardless, it is quite entertaining.

This would get a higher rating if each team had individual timers.

RATING: 7
My wife likes to play this one quite a bit when we're together with friends, especially because it is not especially hindered by having drinks beforehand.  I think it is an o.k game, though I don't like the aspect that one can lose the point because the other team finished up their word, and your team caught the device just as the buzzer rang.  I think it would be improved just slightly if there was a slight time extension when tossed, so a team couldn't be penalized for catching it right at the end.

I own the electronic version of catch phrase and I have played it once and it seems like a great game to play while drinking. My gf has played this with friends and she says that it was always a really fun game to play. If your into party/word games then you will like this game. 

Its very simple to learn and play. I would recommend the electronic version so you dont have to fiddle with cards and pen and paper for score keeping. everything you need is all on the electronic device. This is why I say it is a good game when drinking. You dont need a lot and can have lots of fun!

Best played when everyone has a similar frame of reference.  Otherwise, you end up with a few people on a team using in-jokes and terms from the common frame of reference and the others feeling left out.  But if everyone has a similar background, it can be a lot of fun.

RATING: 7
A fun little game of hot potato crossed with Password: 2 teams (equal # players) sit in a circle alternating team members. The machine, while counting down on a timer, gives you a word/phrase; you give clues trying to get your teammates to guess it. If successful before the timer goes off, pass the machine to the left; they get a new word (same timer continues). When timer ends, team not holding it gets 1 VP. Also, the other team may make one guess: if correct, score bonus 1 VP. First team to 7 VP wins.

The basic (electronic) version of the game is pretty fun. The musical version, however (with names of songs), was really pretty bad -- I have almost NO knowledge of song at all!

This used to be one of my favourite party games until I discovered others that allowed me to make more use of my creative talents, such as "Quip It!" , "Absolute Balderdash", and "Why Did the Chicken...?", or that were simply more fun, such as "Quelf" and "GiftTRAP".  All the same, it's a fun one to pull out with a large group of people who don't want to spend more than two minutes learning rules.  My favourite strategy is to delay my team guessing the word as long as possible and then pass on the timer when I think it is just about to run out.  Game design: 3.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 2.5/5  Total: 6/10

Just pick it up and play, and it works great with a crowd. I really wish games like this would leave out people. Ten years from now it will still be a fun game, but younger players won't know the "famous" people from the 1990's. 

I really like the non-electronic version better. The electronic version seems to have more proper names that many of our younger players just don't know. The mechanical version seems to have more generic-type words that everyone is familiar with.

As far as party games are concerned,  Catch Phrase is an above average option,  assuming you have an affinity for word games.

It is more or less a derivative of the game Password,  with the exception that you are not limited to giving only one clue.  While I haven't played this recently,  I have gotten my  investment back tenfold over the years and this is one I recommend without trepidation.

RATING: 5
I know party games aren't supposed to be played to score points and win, but it seems like they should at least have a sensible scoring system to keep the players engaged and a bit competitive.  This game fails on that count.  It's basically like Taboo where you try to get your team to guess a word or phrase, but you can say anything, so it's very easy.  The hook is that it's hot potato so you pass the device to the other team when you get your team to successfully guess the word.  This keeps going back and forth until a random time when the round ends and the team not holding the device scores a point.  It's entirely random and fairly pointless.  It doesn't really reward or encourage doing well.

all this needs to be a 10, like the board game version, is a randomized timer!!  I hope that when they produce the 3rd edition of the electronic Catch Phrase that it includes the randomized timer.  Makes the game a lot less predicatable, thus a lot more fun and dynamic!

This game drives me crazy because of the hot potato mechanic that every one mistakes for skill and cunning. Just because you pass the torch to me two seconds before the buzzer goes off and I can get out about three syllables doesn't mean you're a better player than I. I'd rather play something like Password or Taboo. I have, however, found this game bearable with modified rules, but then you're basically just playing a different game.

Not bad as an activity, but direly dull as a competitive game.  [gameid=1111] is a better example in this genre, and mixing in a bit of [gameid=4476] doesn't really do this game any favors.  It's nice and easy to explain, which is about the only thing that gives it any cachet.  Stick with it as an activity and don't keep score, and you'll be better off.

Time Waster.  Vastly superior to a certain fruit-related game that shall remain nameless.  Requires at least some thinking (yay!) and is highly social/group-dependant.  Would still rather play Werewolf or Signs, but I'll occasionally settle for this, if the group are mostly total non-gamers. 

Also works as Charades: Rapid Super Challenge Mode!

Lots of fond memories of this one from college. I think the electronic version is better than the board game version due to ease of passing. The downside of this is that it's difficult to implement house rules on scoring (though not impossible) and the beeping can get on one's nerves after a time. Great fun, and probably my favorite large group party game aside from Taboo.

Gets a big mark-down because, at least once per game, people argue over exactly who was holding game/timer when the buzzer went off.  ("You were touching it!"; "No, you were!") Bleah.

Played a few times. Once you accept that some words or phrases are much more difficult than others, and if you manage to get past the annoying noise of the electronic thing, it is a rather enjoyable party game (and playing in English made it an extra challenge for me).

I consider this a must have game for any family. I have never had a group not enjoy playing. It is taught almost immediately and accomodates a wide range of player ages/abilities. The only stipulations are reading ability and an even number of players.

Entertaining party game. Is the electronic version much different? Some comments said it isn't 'fair'.

RATING: 5.5
Not a bad party game. It's a relatively mainstream title that does nothing to intimidate players.

Catch Phrase is a good party game.  The game goes very quickly because the scoring board isn't very long.

I think I hate this game, but my wife likes it.  Easy to play with new people. good for a quick get together game. Somehow I'm forced to play this often, but I usually have fun.

After 20+ Plays: A very fun party game.  My only gripe is that I have the old version with the paper discs, and sometimes the holder would break open if dropped.  In a timed game this is rather annoying, so I might pick up the electronic version.

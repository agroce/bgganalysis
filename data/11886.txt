RATING: 8
The [thing=3685][/thing] system applied to the Texas Revolution.  The big difference is that a turn is 1 week, so you have 3 cards in your hand at all times, and you play 1 card per turn: go through move/combat phase, supply check, and then draw a replacement card, so it takes on a different feel than the wash-rinse-repeat Hammer system.
Playing-wise, it is more asymmetrical than [thing=6719][/thing].  Mexico is powerful, but has to act VERY quickly, which means taking chances and being reckless while conquering and garrisoning along the way.  

Just a superb game with tight play and great balance.

The 8 pages of rules left us with some questions. When we read BGG rules discussion, we have some answers answered. But still some lacking. 

The scenario campaign game left us with questions right from the start. But once we got through to which are 1835-36 units, it becomes slightly clearer. 

The game play is pretty simple. But unlike HoS, Crusaders, and such. It has its own variant in the As and Bs and Cs. 

Overall, the game is simple with low number of blocks and even steps. Making this game a fast and furious manoeuvre and dicing game. 

Cannot comment on historical value. But besides the rule book, the game seem reasonably fun. It does have its left and right flow to the whole game.

A likeable addition to the Hammer of the Scots/Crusader Rex/Liberty family of games.

The 1836 scenario presents asymmetric forces, with the Mexican dashing to grab victory towns in time to stave off revolt back home.  The difficulties of command control, supply and terrain make this less straightforward than it first appears.  The Texan must pick his battles very carefully, avoid getting outflanked, and possibly make better use of sea movement than I did.  

On early acquaintance, the game seems fairly well balanced.  There appears some scope for alternative strategies.  The cards also add some variability.

The version 1.01 rules is about the most complete and well written set I've seen from Columbia.  The map artwork will win no prizes, but it is fairly functional.  My only gripe is that the little dots that represent fords and ferries could have been easier to distinguish.

My first blocks wargame. The system itself is very simple yet evocative. I love the operationnal scale in this game, and the plot : davy crockett, alamo, santa anna, indians...lovely !
The game is asymetric, and is kind of cat and mice once the US army enters the game, as the cat. During play we listened to early ZZ Top's albums, which adds evocative!

My first Columbia game. I was not enamored of Hammer of the Scotts, although I do consider it to be a good game. This topic interests me though so I decided to give Columbia a second chance to impress me. I still don't like the cards, but somehow quality issues don't seem to bother me. My overall impression is that the game looks good and I'm looking forward to playing. I can see myself buying the other games in this system (HoS, CR, A&S) if I find myself enjoying Texas Glory.

Update: It seemed a bit more complicated that Richard III but I like my first game, which was the full campaign.

Last Update: I am thoroughly enjoying the game although there are several rule issues that have required clarifications and balancing adjustments. Please see my review of the game.

RATING: 5.5
Getting a sense of timing for both sides is critically important. I enjoyed the complexity of figuring the logistics, but it required quiet a bit of squinting and referencing in spots which telegraph any plans to your opponent. It reminded me a lot of the game Buffalo where the "rancher" has to cut his losses the whole game and just try to minimize the damage the buffalo do before the game is over.

Had a chance to playtest on an afternoon with another player and Dan Mings (game designer) looking on. What we played was a close-run, enjoyable, 3-hour block game on a map of East Texas. Some chrome to accomodate the occupation and investiture of the Alamo and Goliad. Other rules for US intervention, the call-up of Texians, and Santa Ana's army. This was over a year ago. Things may have changed since then...

An interesting dynamic for a block game, with the Texans constantly falling back. I gather it's a smaller incarnation of EastFront.

Decently-fun game with a lot of back and forth.  Each side  has its "moment in the sun" when you think they can't lose.  But overall it seems very balanced.  1835 scenario is not too compelling and really only for learning.

The one thing that made me a little leery if this title is the 'sitzkrieg' that occurs along every river line - it plays more like WWI or WWII than what I imagine the war was really like - small bands of soldiers on a massive terrain. In this game it's too easy to build a wall across the entire map - there's NO CHANCE there were enough men in the actual conflict to do this.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
First impressions - and I'm learning not to trust first impressions of Columbia games, since they've had a lot of finishing problems of late - are still pretty positive. The situation is quite asymmetric, the game plays quickly, and there are very different tensions for the Texans and the Mexicans. A little early to tell, but Columbia might be getting back on track on this one, after the intriguing gameplay but serious balance problems out of the box for Crusader Rex and especially Athens vs Sparta.

Based on the posted rules, seems a good compromise between Bobby Lee and the Hammer/Crusader/Liberty series.

Have this on the table and am learning. Beautiful map. Am a Texan myself and hope the GF will become interested to learn the history of my state. She seems intrigued by the blocks.

This is a very light wargame. I think I'm unsatisfied by the scale. Not meaty enough for the price.

Texas Glory is a fine block game, simple, fun, and with enough twists to make it interesting. I was impressed with how asymmetrical the two sides are: one big and lumbering with supply problems, the other smaller, quicker, but brittle and with too much to do. Recommended. I may raise my rating after another play or two.

Played with the original rules, which is my mistake, but those are some of the worst rules I've come across in an introductory block game.

This game also loses a point for egregious (read: any) use of Comic Sans on the board. Gross.

The game isn't without its charm, but I feel like it's a race that's tough for the Mexican player to win. It's not as bad as Crusader Rex, but it's certainly no Julius Caesar.

RATING: 9
Very under-rated wargame and one of Columbia Games' best. Playable with the version of the rules as originally released. Some minor tweaks in v1.01 transformed an exceptional offering into a perfect one.

Rules light, plays quick, high replayability potential, flows well, and comes with three possible scenarios - 1835, 1836 and the Full Campaign. Fun & enjoyable, and one doesn't have to be a subject matter expert on the Texas Revolution - what more can you want?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A fine little block game.  Fairly simple but a good number of exceptions and special cases.  The 1836 scenario feels like "Battle of the Bulge" (Mexicans pouring over the border and Texans playing a delay/harass action).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Very balanced and enjoyable game on a topic rarely covered and one I'm not very interested in (all that don't mess with Texas stuff annoys me). Options are a bit limited in terms of maneuver, and I think there are better block games, but this one stacks up admirably to its brothers because it has an interesting mix of units and some good supply rules. This is probably the Columbia Game that comes closet to being a CDG in the [i]We the People[/i] tradition, although it really isn't one.

RATING: 6
Okay: Texmex War - Operational - Easy

Plus:
-Leaders play a crucial role
-Gameplay is quick
-Nice swings of fortune; the cards ensure for a variety.
-Sides play completely different 
-Nice variety of things in only 5 pages of rules; non complex and almost dive in and play.
-Very accessible, exciting gameplay

Minus:
-A mutant block here and there so watch out where you put a sticker on!
-It makes a big difference if the Mexican player is allowed to start the first turn. 
-Replay value; not sure how this one holds up over time. Revisited: indeed the appeal wears of rather quickly due to the limited amount of different strategies. The cards decide her but otherwise not many different options.
-Game favors Texans arguably, will play more and comment later on this.

The usual great htos/liberty/crusader rex system with some own twists.  

Overall: great little wargame with fantastic theme and this one is of the same high quality as liberty. 
A good game but hampered by limited replay value.

See review.

Have not played this the past two years.

Sold it.

Mechanically I like this, however the scenario I've played twice isn't even close to being balanced. Also the Texans have very little to do. With the Mexicans you at least have a lot to do, which distracts from the game balance.

After 1 play. Columbia Games has produced many games with a very similar style in the past few years: Hammer of the Scots, Crusader Rex, Liberty, Athens & Sparta, Richard III. Although Texas Glory also combines the old Columbia standards with the card-driven mechanism first seen in HoTS, it stands out from the other games in terms of style. Texas Glory seems more focussed, resulting in a shorter game that delivers a highly concentrated dose of gaming tension.

You have two scenarios where one side is trying to hold on by their fingernails while the other side hammers away at them.  The constantly cycling hand mechanic is a nice innovation and the fog of war is more effective here than in some other Columbia titles, but I suspect the situation lacks replayability.  That said, pulling off a win with the Texans in the 1836 scenario sure felt cool...

Good block game in Columbia Games style.  Rules vague re when blocks must reveal themselves while moving, but found it easy to house rule probable intent.  Hexside limits for attacks and retreats add complexity, but easy enough to learn.  Turns are fast, game is fast and appears to simulate the conflict well.  Fun, replayable.  Seiges like the Alamo become a minigame, so they have their proper weight without slowing down the overall game.  Good design.

Great theme, interesting game play, the rule book used 8 pages when 12 were needed. The rule book issues are annoying enough that its now for trade. I don't like a modern game that in order to play correctly I have to constantly be online looking up rule explanations.

My first experience with Block wargames. I enjoyed it but I enjoy anything Texas so there you go. There are definite strategies you need to figure out for each side if you're going to pull it off. Texas is outnumbered and outgunned often but the Mexicans timetable is so short that it pretty much evens out.

I haven't played this one yet. I just know that everyone should have a game with a Davey Crockett game piece. Box checked. That said, I like the punch that Columbia Games packs in such a small box AND in such a small rule set. Would love to get this to the table some day.

Cracking little game. Lots of feel and choices, won equally as Texan and Mexican, though the combined game seems to favour the mexicans as texans never seem to do as well as they did in 1835, and then they're all over the shop for Santa Anna's revenge. Still lost as Texans last time just because my regrouped Texan army was undone ina  revenge for the actual San Juan- opponent held the surprise attack card.

12/17/16 Played the 1836 scenario in 2.5 hours. 
I was glad I got to try it. I do like block games, but I'd always tried to steer clear of ones that used hexes and/or road networks, as they are the essence of "fiddly".  For instead of spending 3/4 of one's time thinking about strategy, the player has to instead be a traffic cop and constantly worry about hex side limits, road movement rates, and command ranges. So instead of feeling like Generalissimo Santa Anna I felt I was performing the role of some lowly supply and transport captain the vast majority of the game. So I really see no reason to ever play this game again. Pity, for as a Texan the theme thrills me. But the mechanics grind me down and squeeze most of the joy out of the experience. The poor game balance (I can't see how the Mexicans can win), small blocks, crowded map, and the static nature of the design all disappointed me.

I think Columbia has a winner this time. Tight, balanced, not overly complex, and quick playing. I've seen several games come down to (literally) the last battle of the last turn. The 1835 scenario seems fairly balanced and is interesting in it's own right, but the 1836 scenario is the star. Fast moving with several apparent strategies for both sides. And it plays fast enough to allow you to try out a couple of different strategies in one sitting. Haven't tried the linked "campaign", but I'm eager to. A great effort!

I kicked TG up half a point after a solo play of the linked campaign. Once again, victory was not secured until the last turn. Outstanding!

Relatively simple member of the block game family. Rules are mostly clear. Texans need to fall back as the Mexicans advance. Seems to take a couple hours. After a long hiatus from Columbia block games, this is the first one I've played in years. EastFront's still the best and classic. But I give Texas Glory bonus points for being about Texas history, since I'm from Texas. :)

I made the [[Texas Glory FAQ]].

Pre-ordered by voting for this. This might go down as it seems very difficult for the Mexican player to make progress across the choke points on the map. With very little effort, it seemed the Texans could hold back the Mexicans. I will try again, but something seems not right here, out of the box.

Good game. I like the small amount of blocks in 1835, also the fact it plays fast. Players can easily get a couple games played in an evening, (if you're not one of those players that gets hypnotized by looking at the board). 

A couple minor changes in the posted 1.01 rules. looks like good common sense changes very minor, and clairifications are all, and not many, (so far) This is a fun game IMO. A definite for all those that like block games. Besides, it's cool to have Davey Crocket, and Jim Bowie at the Alamo. "Remember the Alamo!"

Texas versus Mexico? Allright, American history is not quite my cup of tea. Let's play:
The map gives the Mexicans some logistical problems, which is good since their armies vastly outnumber the Texans. Leaders really add a strategic challenge compared to Hammer and Crusader, which are comparable games. Of course dice and card luck play significant roles, but Texas Glory makes for a very enjoyable game, playable in one evening. The latter becomes more and more important to me.

I still haven't figured out how to do well at this; it calls for a great deal of rushing as there isn't much time to accomplich what you need to in each scenario. One side effect though is that it's a fast-playing wargame, good for when there isn't much time.

[comments apply to the main 1836 scenario]

Texas Glory is a logistical puzzle steeped in supply capacity and hexside limits - and an interesting one, at that - but it's nothing that would be labeled as "fun" by most wargamers.  It is, without a doubt, intellectually stimulating. But fun, no.

In a nutshell, Santa Ana's army races to stake out and secure the Texan victory cities, and the Texans do what they can to get in their way.  As far as I can tell, this mostly involves suicide bombing with B and C blocks, running away with A blocks, and gratuitous use of ferry blockades - every single turn, if possible.  Which is to say, if the delaying action proceeds according to schedule, it's nearly combat-free.  Frankly, combat is so entirely sidelined in Texas Glory that the battle rules could almost be included as an appendix, rather than embedded in the main rules text.

I do imagine that, if all three US blocks ever made an appearance (and therefore entered the game), they would have a fairly substantial combat-related effect on gameplay.  But since I've never seen that happen, who knows.

For comparison's sake, the following are what make the game unique compared to other Columbia games:

Players have a starting hand of three cards, but only play (and draw) a single card per game turn.  In the 1836 scenario, this means that each player only plays 12 cards over the course of the entire game.

Rather than activating groups, cards activate leaders - each of which has a one- to two-hex command radius.  Consequently, a single card can sometimes activate every friendly block on the board.

Instead of using the standard three-round combat system, there are only two "real" rounds of combat, with the third round being a forced retreat/parting shot round.  Also, there are no attacking combat reserves (only defensive reserves), and units can regroup into unresolved battles.

Sieges have a Cannonade option, which is clearly one of my new favorite words.

Hex supply limits are checked at the end of every turn (again, which is but a single cardplay).

The rules aren't great, but a good FAQ wiki exists to shore up the holes.

Parting words:

Many of the differences listed above are combat-related.  But again, combat in this game is completely secondary.  So really, you either embrace Texas Glory for its value as a wickedly procedural historical simulation, or you trade the game away.  At the moment, I'm not sure where I stand - but I do feel that it's worth a few more plays.  (Edit: Wrong. Traded away.)

Decent game once you get past the poorly laid out rules (how do the Texans get replacements?) it appears to be a good game. Its very playable and should be a good con game as you can play it a few times in one day.

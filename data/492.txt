This is a fun light-medium to medium game which lasts about an hour and fifteen minutes with 5 players.  I can see that it really needs 4 or 5 players to work properly - with less, the blind bidding just wouldn't be so tense.

I liked it very much but one possible weakness is that the first turn is just jockeying for position and then if all the artefacts go every turn, the game ends in a rush and there isn't much time to acquire a lot of spell cards.  So, the criticism I've heard that the game is too long, can actually be turned on its head.  I'd imagine though, that as you played the game more often, you'd be more prepared for the speed of the ending.

There are a lot of positives here - the bidding is tense, the spell powers (which must be used) are variable and interesting, the different spaces are well thought out and I like the Palace Guard mechanism.  I love the treasure pieces, but I'd have liked to have plastic lamps and a chit to show who won the play 2 artefacts power.

Overall, I love games with player interaction and plenty of thinking and this has both.

The blind bidding mechanism works rather well in this game.

I prefer to play with 4 players as opposed to 3 players.  With a game like this that has such a high screwage factor, in a 3 player game, it is easy to feel picked upon by the other two players.

1st play: Not as much of a smash hit as some of Breese's other games, this is still a solid game. Plenty of big reveal moments and the ability to fake out your opponents and try to trick them into over paying. I think this game would be better with repeat plays as the table talk evolves.

2nd play: This game scratches the same itch as Revolution, without the feeling that you're hopelessly behind in any area.  Round to round you can make up (or lose) a lot of ground.  Also, coming in 2nd in an area isn't a total waste of resources, which makes it a little less frustrating when you lose a tiebreaker.

Very good blind bidding game with wonderful bits and art. Remake of Keydom. Lots of choices every turn to agonize over. Not as much fun with 3 players since the game tends to come down to a tie break. Best with 4 or 5, 5 is best. Use the magic spells for every game, even if it's your 1st time. Also, be sure to use the game varient of drawing 2 spell cards each turn and place them face-up. Two new spells are always drawn each turn, so if nobody buys the spells on any given turn, the cards are discarded. The high bidder picks up both cards and secretly passes the one he doesn't want to the 2nd highest bidder or places the card face down in the discard pile if there was only one bidder. That way everyone knows which spells are out there but not quite who has which spells.

A quite atypical Breese design with blind bidding, bluff and a fair degree of luck.  I've been happily surprised by its staying power - still enjoyable after all these years.

LOVE the art.  Simple enough rules, good blind bidding implementation.  I still prefer playing with face-up magic cards to reduce chaos, and replace the guard tiles with a simple D10.  I think the play length is just right, but the endgame can be deterministic if people are even barely aware of their opponents' artifact counts.  I still like it, but either my tastes have changed or I'd overrated this one (at 9) for a long time.

RATING: 8
If you can handle blind bidding which allows for a lot of bluffing you can really enjoy this game.  I find that the spells are underused.  You need to save them up and unleash many at once.  You need to be aggressive at going after the artifacts at the beginning when they are cheap and easy to get and everyone else is concentrating on raising cash.

This is one of the games where the theme is evocative and permeates every aspect of the game.

Perhaps the 3 treasure is the first one to go for before the key, as once you have that you can mess with a lot of bids, or drop a 3 in a bid for a treasure.  One spell forcing everyone else to place their bids showing is particularly nasty.

Ideal with 5, but need to give it a try with 4 some time.

Clever blind bidding game with so much more. Ruthless with 4 players and I imagine utterly cut throat with 5. Don't underestimate the player interaction and how useful the Djinn's House is. I see little point in not playing with spells and artifact powers. Play with the face up spell card variant and read through the BGG rule clarifications before the first play.

Second play and this has real legs. A need to up the rating to 8.

An interesting way of presenting blind bidding, in a way that doesn't feel like blind bidding.  2-player seems to work using the 3-player treasure cards and removing any largest treasure in a cave that has three, and two palace rooms.

Due to the bits, and the fact that it is a Breese work and I like Breese work, I don't think I could ever trade this away (again).

Through your spies and other resources you've heard that something rare and delightful will be sold in the dark corners of the palace today.  Yes, a sentient threaded carpet that can fly...indeed it would make a fine addition to your collection of gold, treasures and wood carved effigies meant to enhance the libido.  You begin to plot and scheme.  To pull off the caper you will need everyone from your strongest henchmen to the most unassuming burglar in your employ.  Each minion will be put to use to acquire this priceless artifact.  

"Master, I've heard others in the city are aware of the carpet's black market sale" chimes in the lowly pick pocket, Agarrim.  "Luckily there are other relics for sale" he quickly adds.  "Um, uh, perchance we can acquire the Carpet for cheaper than we thought?"  

You sneer and begin to laugh.  Agarrim looks around nervously and also starts to chuckle.  You laugh louder and the "HA HA HAs" are echoing off the stone walls of the chamber.  Agarrim's guffaw erupts to match yours.  His mouth open, beaming with a smile that reveals a golden incisor among the rest of his pearly mashers.  Suddenly, your face contorts to a grimace and you motion to one of your guards. 

An erratic staccato of heartbeats rushes into Agarrim's throat and then he pleads, "Please! No!  I beg of you...I'll clean your feet!  I'll buy more sex statues...they'll have bigger and more engorged members!  I won't tell anyone of your shame!  I'll get my sister to do that thing you like!  Please don..."

A burly, emotionless, guard covers the cut-purse's mouth with a sweat covered palm and proceed to toss him into the nearby crocodile pits.  A Wilhelm scream is heard on the way down.

"If anyone else would like to naysay, or speak out of turn, please, be my guest." you utter to the rest of the group.  "Now let's get on with it!"

Aladdin's Dragon's is one giant game of matching wits and teasing your opponents with what your plans really are.  Each round everyone blindly bids by sending out different strength units to the various spots on the board.  You will need to acquire treasure from the dragon's caves.  Once you've procured the shinies, it's up to the palace to buy artifacts that will win you the game.  Too bad you have to deal with pesky guard to get entrance to the palace. Also once artifacts are acquired they give each player special abilities.  To top it all off each player has a magical lamp which can be used to cast POWERFUL spells.  Using these spells correctly can often lead to a big score. 

I adore the mind games this game presents as each turn is a tense little game.  Then with the reveal you get to see what each player's TRUE intentions were.  Very great Euro style game with a cool theme, great components, beautiful artwork and board.  They don't make em like this anymore.  This game is sadly OOP and hard to find.

Need to get a second play in.  Blind bidding game with alot going on. It really pays to pay attention to what people are collecting and what you are collecting.  I started to do that a couple of rounds too late. My first play was without using magic, so I imagine that would add a ton more to do and how to manipulate you getting certain items. 

So, either this game will go up to a 7 with the magic included or it could drop to a 6 (or lower) if the magic makes it even more chaotic and drags the game out longer.

A terrific family game.  Once the kids understand blind bidding/bluffing the game is on.  I've read the complaints of the game; in my opinion the Magic Cards are being ignored, as is the re-positioning option of the camel.  The game is bland w/o actively using these rules.

I wish the developer would have included more bidding chips to encourage bluffing.

I'm not adverse to blind bidding, so this isn't the problem I have with the game. I like the idea of the spells but the power levels very greatly, pull a good one fine, pull a bad one and it's a wasted bid. Casting spells is a pain too as it commits your artifact use for the turn, so the whole thing feels disappointing. Similarly for the artifacts, power varies massively too - with the carpet being the best. Finally the theme is great apart from the dragons ... why dragons? Overall, not on my list to acquire and I'm in no hurry to play again. Overall for a blind bid mechanic I prefer Sternenhimmel.

Only played it with two, and with a dummy player to get the grip on the rules.
Looks like it can be a real nailbiter when played with more real player.
Will probably increase the rating after a game with four players. Nice looking board and bits.
--- Update ---
Played with four players and the game really shines.
The hidden bidding system gives a nerv-wrecking feeling to the game. This is a nice attribute to the game, which usually have a lot of got-you-feeling in it.
I also think that the spell cards bring another nice strategy part into the game.

The blind bidding is a real fun element that excels most other games of this type due to the substantial selection of commitments (rooms) with a limited amount of bidding chits (8). Balancing out your bids is a real challenge, as you are not sure how much others are committing to rooms you have bids on. Still, by playing your larger bids on the rooms you want you can usually control your successes, especially if you don't act too obvious in its placement. Those that don't enjoy the blind bidding are missing out on a unique bluffing mechanic. The magic cards are well done, allowing for some unexpected turns if the timing is right in how they are played. They are not as powerful as some think, as they can be negated by any other opponent playing the counterspell artifact. I won one game without buying any magic cards, because players typically overbid to get them. Rating is for 4 players, as it drags a little with 5 players. This game is in my opinion one of the most underrated games on this site, probably due to not appreciating the blind bidding mechanic. See my review.

Very entertaining bidding/bluffing game with a nasty pentient for getting even and pulling nasty tricks.  A game full of surprises and deceit, along with a lot of good resource management.  One of the finest german boardgames I have yet played.

This is interesting and rather unlike anything else in my collection. Throughout the game, I felt I was hopelessly behind, but then at the end, I only lost on a tie-breaker. I'm a little unhappy with how swingy the guard is - I think the game could benefit from having a smaller range of potential numbers on the guard (say, 3-7). I also don't know how useful the magic cards really are.  But I enjoyed playing it and definitely want to play more.

Rules are a terrible mess, the board is too big and there aren't enough treasure bits. That said once you actually know how to play it is a terrific game. 

The game itself is one of bidding and brinkmanship to collect currency, power and hopefully gain entry to the palace in order to procure magical items that both score points and bestow nifty powers on those who own it. It might take once through before you get it (or indeed play it correctly) but after that it is well worth the journey.

At first glance this is a very pleasant, fun, and not too heavy of a game.  Then you start to figure out how to screw each other and suddenly this game is just a hoot!  Plays well with four and five, and I suspect three players is fine as well.  A trick to remember you can win the camel and place it in front of someone else!

RATING: 6.5
Very good, light, "blind bidding" game, although it almost feels more like worker placement with bets on each space. The game is extremely simple: bid for treasure, then bid for spaces to sell the treasure. The fun lies in trying to guess what your opponents want, trying to distract them as to what you're going for, and then waiting for the last moment to place down your strongest token on the thing you really want. The timing decisions and tension in the placement round are excellent, as well as trying to predict which artifacts your opponents will use each round.

My two problems with the game are: 1) One bad decision or lousy turn can really take you out of the competition early on; and 2) The game lasts a little too long for my taste. I'd say play to five artifacts (including Aladdin's lamp), which would trigger the game end. I'd also say the magic version is a must: I couldn't imagine playing this without the artifacts and spells, which make this so much better in so many ways.

Played this again recently, I still like it a lot, but I felt like it went on just a little too long for the more modern gaming environment. It's about 90 minutes, which was about the norm 10 years ago, but games are shorter and tighter now and it felt just a touch on the long side.

The card game may actually be better. It does almost everything the boardgame does in a smaller, tighter format.

One of those games that grows on you. I enjoyed it but was not blown away the first couple of plays, but it has steadily grown on me to the point that I think it's one of the best games of 2000 (which was an awfully good year).

Not sure what it is I like so much about this game.  It's almost purely a blind bid, but it's tense and enjoyable nonetheless.

Interesting bidding game in which players place numbered workers on a variety of space with the highest bidder getting to do the action. The artwork and components are very good and the blind bidding is a really interesting mechanism to keep players guessing. The only thing I didn't care for is the spell cards, which are very powerful and can dramatically affect a whole round. Must be interested to try the game without them. Like most bidding games, this is probably at 4-5 players but it is accessible enough that anyone could have a good time.

Wanted to like this one.  Like Ys alot, maybe alot more than I should.  What bugged me about this was 2 things...First, there wasn't any tension in the scoring.  Each tile you win is worth 1 point, so it is possible that the game will be decided before the last round.  If the worth of the tiles you acquire was auctioned in the final round, or something like that, you might make something there, but as it stands right now, it appears unfinished.  Second, if the game is not decided until the last round, then the strength of spell cards will definitely determine the game.  I mean, those things are way too powerful.  Overpowering for the most part.  Like "I play this card and destroy your whole round" sort of powerful.  The gameplay is fun enough, and it is light fare, but too frustrating to rate any higher than this.

All of the brain burn in this game is figuring out what other players' objectives and tendencies are - games like that will always be up my alley. The magic cards are way too powerful, so I would suggest the basic game over the advanced (or at least putting the cards face up ala YS). The theme is so awful that it forces the rating down a point or two. Update: YS fixes all the problems with this game and I would recommend it over this.

Just raised my rating from 8 to 9.  Every time I play this I enjoy it more.  Blind bidding...yes.  Strategy, tactics, bluff, mindgames are all in abundance.  Those that say that blind bidding is full of luck are just plain WRONG.  If you play the game that way, you won't win very often.  Each turn you must plan out a strategy...it's like another puzzle every round.  How much risk/reward are you willing to wager.

Only drawback is that there aren't that many artifacts (the vp's) so if one player gets a "lucky" round and wins 3 or so..it can very difficult to catch up.

RATING: 5.5
A hidden information game where so much information is hidden that you might start to wonder 'what's the point?'. Playing randomly won't help, but playing rationally is no guarantee of success either. The winner might feel that victory was gained by guile, bluff and prowess, yet the loosers will just feel robbed. Making 'good' decisions can get you ahead, but it can also lead to frustration as you find out that you have been 50/50-ed by other players, and you get nothing. Apart from a mechanic that is likely to split opinions, there may be play balance issues too (RE:magic/artefacts/play order). This game is a strong dose of what it is, perhaps too strong for my palate. However, a strong theme and lovely production drag it up from a ' no thanks' to 'OK, one more time...'

超值的它，瀟灑的它，我推薦給大家。
Aladdin's Dragons…今天介紹一隻我玩過兩次的桌遊給大家，它是Aladdin's Dragons (2000 年出的大盒板圖版)，在BGG分數是6.9，排名只有797，家庭類排名是 169。其實我個人覺得 Party Game 有這排名算不差。
它是一隻簡單暗手出TOKEN 比大小的遊戲，遊戲瀟灑順暢，當中亦有卡牌魔法，雖然魔法卡牌功能有點不濟，但可以自行修改，可塑性亦高，若當Party Game 不刪不改 也絕不礙事。
它簡單易教易投入，可以視其輕鬆小品。但它版圖清晰，配件精美，更重要的它只賣USD 20。這價錢比起很多USD 20 以上的Party Game沒有一絲遜色，可說是超值。雖然是荷蘭版，但是BGG 有所有英文規則和卡牌資料，基於超值的它我推薦給大家。

This is a neat game.  The board's artwork and layout are very attractive, but also serve as a reminder of how the game flows.  We recommend bypassing the Basic game and learning the Magic Rules right off the bat.  We did this and play 2-player.  Although the game doesn't officially support 2 players, it actually works better with 2 than some games that do.  Thanks to other people's comments that taught us how to play with 2; here's what you do...  You use only 2 rooms in the palace.  Each room will have a stack of 5 tiles.  (12 tiles are used total.  Each player starts with a lamp tile.  The stacks hold 2 each of the other types.)  When stocking the dragon caves, use the cards included for 3 players.  If a card instructs you to put 3 sets of treasures in a cave, you only put in 2.  Ignore the top (most valuable) picture on the card.  These are very minor changes to the rules as printed.  A 2-player game takes about 45 minutes.

Blind bidding is usually not my thing. However, the colorful components and the way the bidding is handled makes Aladdin's Dragons work.  What I actually have a bit of a beef with is the chaotic nature of the magic cards. I'm sure there are different variants, but the time that I played this we used magic cards and they seemed disproportionately powerful...to the point that any advantage you might have gained through guile could be lost to someone who drew an insanely powerful card.  I realize there are ways to counter that...but it seems out of whack to me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
Blind bidding is generally not a mechanic I'm a fan of, and this game does little to change that. The artifacts seemed like they would be interesting paired with the spells, but because of the plentiful piles of counter spell ability that the game offers up I have to say that buying spells seems like a wasted effort unless it is early and none of the counters have come up...on a second playing the counters weren't used as much and the spells became more useful and the game was slightly more interesting for it, but I still dislike them for the most part...they are either useless, or overly useful...the main effect is extra chaos, which I do not care for. Meanwhile the artifacts vary from minorly useful (Key) to tactically deadly (the carpet). There are decisions to be made here, and there are possibilities, but it all really comes down to out bluffing your opponents; some like this kind of game, but it doesn't do much for me. I also really dislike the victory point scheme...it's just the artifact count and it is very difficult to get more than 1 artifact in a round...if someone does you had better beat on them for the rest of the game because otherwise they are very hard to catch. Overall I have to say pah to you former Key game with beautiful pieces, I hope you are never seen on my table again.

A terrific game that I just don't get...I can't play it to save my life.  The blind bidding is fun, it plays smoothly (if a little too long), and has quite a few surprises for gamers and non-gamers alike.  Somewhat overlooked, which is unfortunate because it's a winner.

RATING: 8
This is a easy to learn game but which holds a lot of strategy due to the fine balance between multiple necessary goals. I probably could have said that better but it just came out that way. To repeat you have to carefully decide where to spend your money to collect the right jewels which are then used to buy artifacts. The winner is the player with the most artifacts. There is more to it than that because there is a middle level to the board which is the city where you can also spend your money on 5 other areas which give you various advantages. The only drawback in the whole game for some might be the blind bidding but in this case I think it adds to the game.

Good game, moderate planing time and rather simple rules make it OK also for non-gamers. The rules are simple but the rule book is confusing. Louis XIV seems a bit related to this game (area majority bidding, special area rewards, clockwise step by step area resolvement.)

Think El Grande with bluffing.  A great game, though the bluffing aspect minimizes strategy to a degree.  It suffers from the "rich get richer" problem, as winning early artifacts can make it MUCH easier to win more artifacts, which is the goal of the game.

My initial enthusiasm cooled after several plays. Aladdin's Dragons is a fine game by any standard, with an interesting mechanic of blind bluffing to achieve your goal. It is always great fun to turn over the chips to find out who wins the privilege of a certain playing field. However, once people begin to collect artefacts and magic cards, things become rather ad hoc and chaotic. The fine and subtle balance of the first third to half of the game gives way to a 'take that!'-type of title. The magic cards are not that balanced either, meaning that you tend not to use them—or grin mischievously because you were extremely lucky. It helps considerably if you play this game with a variant in which you turn up the cards on offer to allow people to decide on their own whether they would like to pursue that option or not. Blind bidding is, after all, a good mechanic to use in a game, but one should be very careful with anything that upsets the subtle psychological play, and with closed cards that is precisely what happens. 

With the gameplay settled to full satisfaction, all that remains to be sorted out is the annoying amount of tiny rules questions which invariably turn up when a game with lots of special character powers is released. Can you do X before Y, with Z, after Z-prime, and so forth. I think I ought to mail to Richard Breese one of these days to get an authorative answer to settle the questions once and for all.

[b]Update[/b] While there is an unmistakable care-free nature to this game, repeated plays have shown that looking for shrewd and clever play is best done elsewhere. Artefacts and cards are indeed, as I already noted, disruptive of what is a fragile game to begin with; sometimes winning artefacts is more luck than intent. It's also odd that unattractive artefacts remain the goal of the game instead of the rather attractive gems. I don't mind playing it after all this time, but to say I'm eagerly anticipating the experience would be a lie.

I enjoyed this game.  Blind bidding isn't my favorite mechanic, but this works pretty well and doesn't take all that long.  It is hard to tell if strategy wins here or if it is mostly luck.  But it is fun enough and short enough that I don't really mind either way.

This one I like. Some kind of proto-worker placement disguised as blind bidding. Send your workers to the caves and to the palace with their strength hidden from the other players. Add spells of varying power and a neat way of using several currencies, and you have a nice game that could be played by family as well as new and old gamers. Might be a bit long by todays standards, but still one of my favorite games by Breese.

Math trade Feb 2008.

Love the artwork in this game.  Its a real shame that its not still in print.  Took a Math trade for me to get mine, but it was worth it.  

So far I've only played the simple version with my kids, but I'm really excited to add on the magic and artifacts.  Kids don't want to do that yet.

Will rate game once we add in all the features.

This is blind bidding at its best.  Need to play this more though and compare to YS.  Enjoyed YS a lot so I'm wondering if I need both.

Good, fun euro style game.  Aladdin's Dragons is a unique game design that uses an innovative bidding mechanic to navigate position into the various areas of the game board.

I enjoy playing this game, which has solid rules and has very little downtime.

I find many of the spells overly chaotic; their effects end up eclipsing the much more interesting blind-bidding competitions and planning-with-uncertainty. With a pruned spell deck, though, I enjoy this game considerably more than I used to. (This does, of course, shift game balance - gaining spells becomes less valuable, as does cancelling a spell, but so long as everyone realizes that it's fine.)

I've also seen the suggestion to turn the two spells for the round face-up before placement/bidding starts; that could work well, too.

This is a great game where all players have the same 8 tiles available (1-9 less a 3) and take turns placing face down to compete for treasure in the dragons' caves, advantages in the town, and VP artifacts with special powers in the palace. The result is much tension among competing short-term and longer-term needs and uncertainty about how much to commit in order to win a key space.

So, if you want a good family game to break out and play with your "tweeners", go get Aladdin's Dragons.

The game features players putting numbered bidding chips face-down onto the board sequentially. After the players have placed all of their chips, then each of the areas is resolved. The bottom part of the board is where players attempt to gather treasure tokens, which is the overall currency of the game. The middle part of the board features a number of special actions, which help the players cast spells, trade in their resource tokens, or block other players' actions. The top part of the board is where players use treasure tokens to purchase artifacts, and the player who can collect the most artifacts by the end of the game will be the victor.

Beautifull game with lot of nice plastic parts. For me it's just a light blind auction game and I don't like the specials cards, too powerfull, too chaotic and too ...unfair. I play without these cards.

edit: my children don't want to ply without the special cards. They love games whereyou can gain special abilities.

The worker placement in this one is very interesting. Each of the workers has a value of 1-9, but is placed face down... so you know how many workers someone has placed, but not the total strength of their workers.

Do not bother playing the basic game (without the magic cards). Definitely play the full game... it's good!

There are some interesting ideas having to do with the different artifacts and items, as well as the basic idea, but the blind bidding mechanic pretty much spoils it.  Everybody makes a bunch of blind bids on different items all at once, then all are revealed.  The strategy in that is completely random.

You might as well just play poker -- it's a lot quicker and less complicated, and involves the exact same strategy of pure bluff.

A very enjoyable blind bidding game with tight resource management and planning. Don't play it when people are tired or cranky though since we've seen tempers fray when people get overbid. Almost no downtime either. :-)

Very fun.  Limited resource semi-blind bidding.  Order of auctions is very clever.  You must bid on the victory rooms before you know how much money you will have.  Magic rules are terrific.  DOWNGRADE.  I can't tell you the number of times I've reached for this game on the shelf, and then not brought it to the table.  No idea why.  Some sort of force field I think.

This one just doesn't engage me the way it should.  I can't put my finger on why.  I think games that have a "ha-ha! you thought you were winning but you didn't know I had THIS" effect tend to do that to me.  I seem to recall this did that.

Not really sure how to rate this game. It's fun with lots of cool ideas but blind bidding isn't really my favourite mechanic. I do like the scalability of the game.

Lots to like - Angst over whether you've bid enough.  Special powers from artifacts and cards.  The whole bluffing and blind-bidding.  Colorful board and bits.  Just a very good all around euro.

After 1 play, the jury is still out on the cards.  It might be too much chaos put in.

Somehow I missed this playing this one until recently (2011).  Glad I finally got a chance to play this one as many consider it to be the grandfather/king of the (good) blind-bidding games.

RATING: 5
The child of Keydom, by Richard Breese. Keydom was easily the best of the "Key" series, and deserved a reprint. The setting has been moved to a middle Eastern setting, and players use a blind bidding/token mechanism to try and influence and win the most artifacts. It's an interesting game that can catch players out if they spread too thin or concentrate their tokens too heavily. A variant adds a deck of spells that really adds a ton of chaos into the mix and undermines the planning element, or what planning you can do with blind bidding.  I much prefer the original game.

This was one that I had been wanting to play for a long time and was a little disappointed after finally getting to play it. I like blind bidding games in general and the mechanics of this one are fine, but it just got boring. It moves slowly and I just got a little sick of doing the same blind bidding over and over again, which is all there is to the game. I still think it is fun, but it wasn't as astonishing of a game as I was expecting.

The more I play Aladdin's Dragons, the more I enjoy the game of Aladdin's Dragons. I guess it takes a couple of games played of Aladdin's Dragon to really see it's worth. It took a couple of plays to enjoy the blind bidding part of the game. I bought my copy after I played a couple of games.

Recently played Aladdin's Dragon again. I still had fun playing this game. The blind bidding is great in Aladdin's Dragons. Judging the worth of each lot of gems and spots on the game board is not easy. Each player has their own idea of how much each spot of the board is worth. So getting something you really want for a fair price can be hard. Especially when playing with maximum players. It can be costly if two players targets the same thing. Goal is to get what you want cheapest as possible in order to use your other tokens elsewhere.

Some tiles are more powerful/useful than others. Player with most tiles wins. 

I am more used to this kind of auction, I enjoy it more than I was at the beginning. I`m happy that I have this auction/bidding game in my game collection today.

Blind bidding is quite different compared to your typical bidding games. I have to say that auction/bidding is one of my favorite game mechanics in board games.

Richard Breese does it again with an interesting game of bluffing and balancing power influence. The theme is most certainly slapped on, and has nothing to do with how the game plays (players interested in Arabian Nights should play...well, "Tales of the Arabian Nights"). Some of the mechanics might get a little repetitive after a while (each round consists of working up your way from the caves to the palace, each space being resolved in a "who has the most influence" battle). Basically worthy.

With the exception of Container, I'm weary of blind bidding games. Seeing how Aladdin's Dragons is one of those classic, golden-age games I had to give it a try. It's a good game, but it does feel a little dated too. There are some spell cards that wouldn't fly in a modern euro. If you're willing to deal with that frustration factor, this is a neat game to try. I know I'd happily try it again, especially at the magic crappy number: 5 players.

RATING: 6.7
Wow.  What a beautifully made game with quality components. 

I was a little disappointed in the play, however. All a player has to do is keep score of how many artifacts a player has won, (which is not that difficult with 3 players, because there are only 15 to be secured, and you know how many you have), and when the majority is won there is no way to catch up (unless maybe there is a special card and you are close), so there is no sense in playing to the end.

The theme is irrelevant.  This game could be played with any theme.

We played the Magic modification.  I think the basic game would have been extremely boring.  I also think and hope that playing with 5 players would improve the game (we played with 3).

When I first read about this game it was already out of print. It took me a long time to find it.  Maybe the anticipation of the game over rated it in my mind.

I think it is a good child's game.

Bluffing and blind bidding at its finest.  Exquisitely difficult to choose the right combinations every turn; the suspense revolves around where to put your pawns to get the best advantage.  Tons of opportunity for mayhem.  Keep your eye on the goal: the most artifacts win; it doesn't matter if you have lots of treasures and spells.  The artifacts are it.  Fantastic game.

Good game, but takes a little too long given the repetitive actions and the impossibility of long term planning. Spells seems a little unbalanced, some being way too strong.

RATING: 5
It's blind bidding.  Blind bidding where everyone loses their bid is perhaps the worst game mechanic in existence.  Aladdin's Dragons is close to that.  The difference is that you have a fixed amount to bid every round, so while you don't really "lose" anything by losing a bid, you also don't gain any advantage for future rounds (since the winner didn't really "spend" anything to win the bid).  Bidding in the palace (one third of the auctions) is a bit different, though, since there the winner does have to spend something and the loser doesn't.  

Overall, there's enough of a feel of the blind-bidding-loser-still-pays that this game only gets a solid "average" rating from me.  I like auction games in general, but this one is near the bottom of that list.  I prefer Modern Art, Princes of Florence, Vegas Showdown, O Zoo Le Mio, For Sale.  I haven't tried Ra or Amun Re, but I expect they'd rate higher, too.

Theme is very, very thin.

RATING: 7
Aladdin's Dragons is a pretty game and as a game that uses blind bidding, it is quite solid. But this game suffers from the "Magic Spell" cards, that are either useless or swingy.  They can really change the progress of the game and it's done in a very irritating way rather than fun or zingy.  Just huge amounts of "TAKE THAT!".  Sometimes, a card can be so swingy that it is really just played so that somebody wastes their artifact play on a counterspell. Without the spells though, the game would be kinda... boring.  It is pretty much a wash-and-repeat blind bidding for jewels and then using these jewels to buy artifacts.  The purchase system for those artifacts is a real neat idea (the bid to buy is also the amount and different types of jewels you need to spend) but that's about the only neat thing here.  Too bad.  Great looking game though! And not bad, but not great considering all the other games out there.

Blind bidding, the long extended uncut version. I don't mind blind bidding when the resolution is quick. But in this one, the blinders never come off. And if that weren't enough, there's the chaos of the Spell cards. The kind of game that makes me peevish.

A fun game, colorful board, although the box-art doesn't grab me.  Great gems!  Although it would be easy to dismiss this as a blind-bidding game, there are interesting choices to be made and a nice bit of variety with the magic cards in play.

From my Ys rating:
"First off, ya just can't help but want to compare this game to Aladdin's Dragons.  Both are fine games.  Ys definitely has more to consider in terms of how to get gems and increase their value, and I do like playing one broker down and the other broker face up.  The components are  much nicer in Aladdin's Dragons, but the components in Ys are fine.  Themewise, Aladdin's Dragons is more fun, and the game mechanics match the theme.  I like how the areas depend on each other in Aladdin's Dragons, whereas in Ys it's more a matter of adapting and maximizing your points."

Update: 5/25/16
Fun to revisit this, but yeesh, those spell cards are swingy. No wonder people suggest playing them face up. Also, it seems like every game I've played there is confusion with some of the cards abilities and their timing. Also, I stink at this game!

The bluffing aspect of this game is what really makes this one fun. You groan when you see that you placed several of your good chips and still lose to your opponents highest chip, while in another area you won some gems with nothing but your crappiest card once it was revealed. I like the aspect of coming in second on a lot of dragon treasures, hardly playing any of your points, and getting only 1 less gem than the person that really fought for it. The spells and magic items juice it up and make it a little more interesting as well.

In theory, I really like the game. In practice, the amount of malice I see in play is a real turn off.

Aladdin's Dragons is a blind auction game that is also, in some ways, a zero sum game. Everything you win in the game might be something that you take away from another player in a lot of ways.

It is possible to have a bad round in which you get nothing. And, when that happens, that can be enough to bury you for the game.

Played 10+ This game is a joy to look at and play. The decisions are difficult and plentiful. The randomness of blind bidding is partially countered by the knowledge that at different stages of the game, spaces vary in desirability therefore you do have a notion of the value of your opponents bet. I have had a good time at games conventions with this game and have enjoyed it with the family. Rule sticklers could grind the fun out of the game trying to resolve the order in which magic events are resolved. May 04.

You're bidding semi-blind (you can see how many tokens have been placed, but not their value) on several different lots. Given that this is a multi-player game, this means that you can be out-bid in every lot*, and there's not much you can do about it.

(*Unless of course you spend all your tokens in one area. While that will guarantee that you'll win that auction, it will also guarantee that you lose the game.)

Blind bidding done right: the players place several tokens with different values face-down on different spaces of the board, one at a time, which creates a nice tension and opportunities for bluffing. The theme is thin but contributes to my enjoyment. The problem is that I'm not very fond of blind bidding, and the magic cards add luck and chaos to a game with a central mechanic that already is inherently chaotic.

Liked it back in the day and still do. While i'm not a big fan of blind bidding, this game works for me, as you can still compete even if you don't win each majority. You have enough workers / points to spend, so that you are always able to get something out of it.

Artifacts and spells are really powerful, though. Maybe even a bit too much, but I guess players wouldn't go for the spells if they weren't as good. The artifacts however coul've been weaker since they are the victory condition, too.

Anyway, nice game.

This game didn't really click with us at first, so it sat on the shelf gathering dust for a few years.  We gave it one last chance before getting rid of it -- and that was a revelation!  Game play is all about blind bidding, so it requires a few plays before you can estimate what things are worth.  Very engaging with little down time. A beautiful board and pieces to boot.  Experienced gamers should skip the basic game and use the "advanced" rules from the get-go.

This must be the ultimate embodiment of blind bidding as a driver for a game (although see Chang Cheng for an even more 'blind' example) and that's never be my favourite gaming mechanism. The high quality components make it feel like a good gaming experience, but the chaos factor is huge with random card  and artifact play. That, together with scoring based on winning the small number of artifacts available means that everything is dependent on getting lucky in a few key bids.

Wow.  I never thought I'd see the day.  Blind bidding that actually works well...

Aladdin's dragons is a tough, soul-crushing excercise in double guessing, tactical brutality (but in a good way!).  Really, any one move can make or break you, just like most blind bidding games, but it really doesn't seem like randomness.  There's just enough variation, number of auctions to enter, and special abilities to keep things from slipping into total chaos.  I also have to mention how much I love the board.  It seamlessly blends together to almost look like a piece of art.  -Brilliant design and layout.

Tried only with 5 players. The components are of a high standard and there is a fairly strong link between the theme and the game itself. The city locations, magic items and the spell cards add up to a fairly rich game with a significant tactical planning aspect. However for a game of its length there is a lack of player control; because so much information is hidden (due to blind bidding, spell cards and even the use of a screen to hide treasures and artifacts) the success or failure of a player's plans can sometimes feel like they are in the hands of the gods. Still, I'm enjoying the game more with each play.

Very fun bluffing/bidding game.  The blind bidding mechanic is made very interesting by the sheer number of actions to bid on in a turn forcing you to carefully manage your resources.

Boy I can't believe how much YS borrowed from this game. This is a good little game by Mr. Breese and I would be kinda pissed myself unless permission was granted.  

Anyway, although some changes are for the better in YS cutting out some of the randomness and allowing for more planning, this is still a really nice system. Some things seemed too powerful however and the all bids being completely blind sure adds to the chaos. Easy to learn but no real long term planning which is okay because you mostly play this title for fun anyway.

(No 2P support)

Players blind-bid around the board with their chits numbered 2 to 9. Highest bid on each space gets the money, or the special action, or the right to buy a victory point costing the amount they bid. Lots of special power actions available. Arabian/magic theme.

The nice bidding dynamic suffers only slightly from its multiple-simultaneous-possession-disorder.  (Multiple players can all feel they "own" the same resource at the same time.  IMHO this can be a more tense social dynamic than games where ownership is clear but can be stolen.)

Played with 5.  I'm not much of a blind bidding game kinda guy so take this comment for what it's worth.  I found the experience to be nothing short of chaotic.  Some feel like there's some measure of "meta gaming" occuring here...I find that comment rather amusing actually.  In a five player game if you can read your four opponents and have some inclination in terms of where they're placing their 8 bids then quit wasting your time playing this game and go to Vegas.  If the blind bidding aspect wasn't random enough throw in a deck of magic spells which are poorly balanced and have screw your neighbor tendencies.  Additionally, the artifacts have different powers with some certainly being more powerful then others.  Mehhh...I think i'll go ahead and double my bid...sorry you not only wasted your two highest bidding tokens but the rest of your plans are done for this round...have fun sucking hind tit for the next hour or so.  I would say a weak comparison to Citadels has some merit.  Of the two I'd pick Citadels but only because the gaming experience (by experience I mean agony) plays out more quickly. I'd recommend this game for those looking to expand their Citadel gaming experience.  I would strongly recommend avoiding this title if blind bidding isn't your thing or if a high level of chaos/randomness bothers you in a 90+ minute game.

The gameplay fell very short of my expectations based on many of the high ratings and positive comments posted here.  The blind-bid auctions really felt more like complete guesswork rather than any real speculation on the "value" of a given area of the board.  To me, the game seemed about as suspenseful as a game of "rock, scissors, paper" and the "decision-making" felt analagous to placing bets on a roulette table.  Maybe there is some deep "meta-game" that is lurking beneath the surface, but I just don't see enough here to inspire me to try and find it.  Maybe my expectations were too high.

Morgenland is a worker placement game from before this term was invented. It's unique twist is the blind placement of workers valued 1 to 9. There's no limit to the amount of workers placed in a single space which makes it a game of bluffing. If you really want to get something this usually can be assured by a massive investment but the winner will be the player who gets the most with the least effort. Choose your battles wisely.
As lies in the nature of blind bidding games there's a notable random factor but that's fine with me. It's a game of double-guessing and this is where the fun is coming from. What bugs me is the digital winning condition. Either you get to purchase an artefact or you don't. In the end, winning scores can be 7,7,6,5,5. Also, it's difficult to catch up when somebody gets off to an early lead with cheap purchases of two artefacts at once. Morgenland could have a place as a less strategic  version of worker placement games but 90 minutes is a bit long for that.

Man, this is great! It truly takes the number of players into consideration, and is easily set to play with three, four, or five. The only drawback is the five-player maximum. THere have been game nights when we could have had seven or eight players, if space permitted! 

One of the other cool feats is it is three strategies in one game. Are you going to bid for monetary reward, magical or city assistance, or palace-guard bribing and magic item bidding in the Sultan's chambers?

RATING: 7
I played once and we didn't use the magic. The next time I play, I'd like to use all the rules.

Without, the series of blind bids were a curious exercise in group-thinking. Players seemed to take actions in small groups. In the last round I started to feel as if I had goals and could work towards them.

My initial impression was lukewarm. Playing again may raise my rating (from 6), but I doubt it would lower it.

Update: It [b]is[/b] better with the spells and artifacts! Much better. Fun with five. I have my doubts about it being as good with fewer.

Outstanding game.  One of the most intense, vicious games I've ever played.  Fairly complex introduction to the new player, but easy to pick up within a round or two (and with patient teachers as well).  The face down bidding was agonizing, and the effects of spells and artifacts made it much more competitive/strategic than just a 'guess what I played' thing.  I've never heard so many groans in a single game.  I'm just itching for another game.  Warning:  If someone in your group is prone to extreme analysis paralysis, this game may not be for them.

Bought August 2007. German edition, Morgenland. Not yet played.

July 2008. Have now completed applying the spell card paste-ups, a long overdue action. I used some surplus card sleeves from my Magic days, and simply slipped in the english text along with the cards. Each player will get an artifact summary with their shields. Still not played, but getting closer...

UPDATE 090329. Have now had my first game of Morgenland. Plays excellently, with a real old-school german game flavour. Divide scarce influence between gaining & applying resouces, with the right mix of second-guessing, random resources & blind-bidding. 

Very good stuff, well worth the time taken in pasting this up (or, sleeving w/slips & printing out the English rules).

Non-magic version: Pretty quick blind-bidding game and not half bad at that. Doesn't have too much to offer, though. Most likely the magic version will fix that, and as a negative side-effect, make the game two times longer.
Magic version: There's quite a bit more to do, and using the full rules makes it a better game. It doesn't actually take all that much longer either. My rating stays the same, however.

Blind bidding and outguessing. I'm a bit torn between the two modes of playing. The basic mode seems to be too bland but the "magic" mode tends to devolve into a "screwage" game, which I don't enjoy in particular. Nonetheless, I think the game's core mechanism is cool. It offers an interesting dilemma: to win a chance to buy the artifact (to win the game), you should bid high, but if you bid too high, you might not be able to pay because you have to pay the same amount as you bid.

Blind bidding is generally a mechanic from which I try to steer clear. Double think just isn't my bag. Aladdin's Dragons, however, is blind bidding done just right. The game truly shines with the so-called "advanced" rules (which you should never play without). Artifacts - the game's victory points - aren't only for scoring, but also help you with special powers to call upon in future rounds, making a great game even better. [b]8.5[/b]

RATING: 5.5
The game has some problems with the rich getting richer, and there's definitely a luck aspect involved with the palace guards.  There's obviously also lots of quasi-blind bidding (you can at least detect the presence of bids), which some people do not enjoy.  I have not played with the magic spells, which add a variety of effects (and complexity) to the game.

I have since traded the game away.

If you like the mechanic, you'll probably like the game.  If not, you won't!  Obviously, I'm a fan of the blind bid.  Heck, I'm a fan of any bidding mechanism.  Bidding mechanisms automatically balance the different spaces in games like this.  You must play with the magic cards - rather boring without.

Played only once: a very close final scores, but I got one artifact more than other two guys so I won. BUT was it good? Well, other three of us kind of liked it, I'm not sure is it me or the game... but, I'm not a fan of blindbidding and in this game it's kind of heart of the whole package. Also those magic-cards aren't a good idea, but maybe other likes them more than I do? I'm ready to play Aladdin's Dragon, but this is not my cup of tea.

Most of the people who don't like this game don't like the SECRET AUCTION aspect. I must say this IS MY FAVORITE PART everyone huddles around to see and comment when the bids are being placed and ohhs as the the winners are revealed. it's alot of fun. I'm surprised this one is often overlooked on lists and forums. It's a truly unique game which isn't too complex for transitioning gamers.

(house rule: you don't give back (Gems)money at the end of each round, we hate throwing away money and the game lasts too long if you do.)

Initial play left me kind of flat. The cards seem over-powered and the blind-bidding negates a lot of strategy. After reading the rules I thought the game would go on forever and the end conditions seemed unlikely. In 30 minutes we finished so now wonder what we did wrong.

On a separate note, blind-bidding works better as a mechanic and as part of the theme in other games (Fist of Dragonstones, Turn the Tide, For Sale).

I have no idea why this is rated so highly.

RATING: 10
The basic game alone is a ton of fun.  The secret bidding creates strategy and bluffing as does the numerous places to bid for control over.  The advanced game takes it to a whole other level.  Not only with 2 additional spaces to bid for, but with the addition of magical spells and the artifacts' uses, strategies must constantly be adjusted.  Simply fantastic.

Check the session reports for this, I've related a 2 player experience which worked quite well. Essentially, play as 3 player, but use only 2 rooms of the palace, each room containing 5 treasures (2 of each treasure, randomly placed into each room). Which is really the exact rules for any number of players.

Plays best with 3 players.

Really good game. Artwork is stunning, easy to explain to new player, interaction is really good. The magic version should be used on the first game. The power of the different artifacts add so much to the gameplay. And since they are limited to once per turn it's self balancing. On the plus side : the treasure are mucho cool! They look like candies!

Update: This is really a quick game with nice possibilities. After playing Caylus, Leonardo Da Vinci and Age of Empires III I feel that this game shoudl be credited as being their granddaddy!

Prior to playing I thought I would not like it.  But it has some very simple bidding mechanic which does work very well.  You place a value face down on a space and whoever has the highest value gets the first actions or take the action.  You need to gather gems to then get cards in the palace that provide some advantages in the game.  Plays reasonably quickly. I do wonder if its replayability is very strong.  I liked though and would play if in the mood.

RATING: 8
This is the game Caylus should have been!  The blind bidding, along with the card play, adds a welcome element of bluff/luck that reduces the brain-burningness of open information games, such as Caylus.  In sum, all of the resource managment with none of the burn.  The theme is a little goofy--who knew Aladdin had dragons?  The components are great, though.  You gotta love the treasures.

Very exciting secret bidding game. Because bidding is secret, you are liberated from analysis paralysis. Once all bidding markers have been put on the board, the actions where you bid for are executed by the highest bidder. That makes gameplay very fast.

Most important minus is the game rulebook. Probably one of the worst ever seen. 

Some cards are overpowered and can break your winning chances, something you cannot protect yourself from.

Bluffing is possible when you have at least some pieces of informations about what your opponents have and what your opponents want. But in this game there is almost no information. And range of values of tokens is too much wide. Its pure guessing process deprives of fun, tension, and excitement.

Theme is really irrelevant, too. Only good is Doris' artwork.

A nice game that has elements of RAJ in it - hidden bidding to capture items. Best played at a fast pace so as not to over analyze what everyone else is doing, Aladdin's Dragons can be very tense at times and outwitting your opponents can be VERY satisfying. Ive come up with a slight variant you may want to try - it's in the article's section.

In its core, this is a light-weight blind-bidding game. It needs a little bluffing and a little tactical thinking. The theme adds some flavour to it. Artifacts and spells complete the game by bringing some complexity.

In fact, nothing on this game is very special or exciting, and yet, it plays elegantly. It's fun to play, it's exciting without being too tense.

For me, this game has the X-factor.

It looks like a classic, feels like a classic, and plays like a classic. This game is awesome! Mind you, I really enjoy blind bidding, and if you don't enjoy that mechanic, you will not like this game. Also, if you don't like chaos, DON'T PLAY WITH THE MAGIC CARDS. I ended up getting the "Spy" card in our game (2-player), which fundamentally breaks the blind bidding mechanic. It definitely propelled me to win the game. There's no doubt the magic cards are extremely powerful, particularly in a 2-player game. That said, there is enough balance worked into the locations, artifact tiles and gameplay to offset powerful moves. Good stuff!

Plays great with 2!

Good first game. Would need to play more games, but the games mechanic are nice. It's a blind bidding game where not only do you need to choose how much to bet, but also, where!! There's a lot of space on the board and many strategies, spells and artifact also influence the game. I'd like to play a few more games to make sure, but I think this is a great bidding game. If you like easier, not as deep bidding, I'll go with Modern Art, but if you like bidding plus, try this one!!

Rating based on a couple of plays with 5 players, one of which I won handily.  Sweet game.  Very fast and simple, even though it may not look it initially.  This is ideal for what I would like in a worker placement game - straightforward play, quick play time, plenty to think about but not so much that it bogs down.  I wish I had a copy.

Good game with interesting decisions to make regarding placement of your tokens with imperfect information as to what opponents are doing.

There appears to be an issue with the magic cards (they seem to get counterspelled a LOT) but perhaps that has just been the result of how they have been used.

This was a purchase for the kids.  It seemed pretty fun and had some cool looking pieces.  It was an OK experience overall but maybe the blind bidding and magic rule complexity were too much for the younger ones.  They were troopers and played it out twice, but didn't feel like a quick revisit was necessary.

RATING: 8.5
Wow! Players place tokens with varying values on the board upside down in different spots to try to win bids (blindly).  Once everyone has placed their tokens the winners are revealed on each spot and players can play artifacts or spell cards they have previously won.  The pieces are absolutely gorgeous and there's a ton of tough decisions and chances to screw your neighbor.  Breese is turning into one of my favourite designers.  For you blind-bidding nay-sayers this one has a lot more going on than just blind bidding and it may take an open mind and a couple of plays to see this game's brilliance.

The blind bidding mechanism creates a delicious bluffing scenario that I really enjoyed. The scoring is coarser than I would like but it plays fast enough that it's not so bad. I won't seek this out. I won't even make efforts to play the advanced game (I've only played basic). But I enjoyed my single play of it and, like most Breese games, it's worth it just to experience the primary mechanic that gives the game its identity.

Yes, it's a blind bidding game, but it's a great game regardless.  How much should I pay for 5 red treasures?  Will I have enough for the Flying Carpet artifact in the palace?  Maybe I should bid on the space that allows me to play two artifacts... just in case.  I highly recommend this game that has lots of tough decisions and is oozing with theme.

UPDATE: Bumping the rating up to 8 after a few more plays.  What can I say?  I'm a sucker for the blind bidding and bluffing mechanism.  This game is a real treat with the right people.

UPDATE: Bumping this to a 9 after even more plays.  I really enjoy this game.  The magic system leads to some tough decisions as to when artifacts are played.  And as we all know, tough decisions are what makes board games so entertaining.  It's just rock solid fun.

I just don't get it with this game. Go for money and artifacts in the first three rounds and block other people afterwards. Most of the time it's too late for other players to block you off if you had some successfull first rounds.

Some how I lost all my "magic" cards for this game. I know I had them when I opened the box (at home) after purschasing this game super cheap from the closing of my local WoC store, but now I can't find them anywhere. I know it has to be around here somewhere, but where? Unplayable until I fight this component.

Fun game with an interesting twist on the blind auction/bidding system. I like how the game goal is to collect the antiques that also make each player more powerful. Might be a good gateway game but probably a little bit too complex for the budding gamer. The more games by Richard Breese that I play the more I think the guy is a genius. I really must get around to playing my copy of Keythedral.

Maybe it was because it was late and I was getting tired or that the rules explanation was a bit unclear, but I found the game chaotic and tedious (although there were some comical moments).  I'm not saying it's a bad game, but maybe just not a game that clicks with me.

RATING: 6.5
A very clever and functional mechanism, very nice board and components. The theme is quite irrelevant. At no point did I have the feel that I was killing dragons, collecting treasures, entering the Palace or using Aladdin’s lamp. But then again this complaint is valid for most of Eurogames.

RATING: 4
Between this and Keyflower, I think that Richard Breese is a designer I just don't appreciate as much as others do. The board and overall presentation are very cool, and makes this game look like it belongs alongside other classic Rio Grande games like El Grande. The game play, however, is far less interesting. I usually don't mind blind bidding in games. Revolution is one of my favorite gateway games. Here it just felt too wide open and uninteresting. I can see how this might have been a lot more compelling when it came out, but nowadays a game has to have a little more going on to hold my attention.

Put bid tokens face down in different areas: the dragon caves, market, guard, and palace. Reveal bid tokens (multiple tokens per area are allowed), then whoever has the highest value is awarded the spoils. Dragon caves give gems, palace gives treasures, etc. Player with the most treasures win. The blind token placement aspect, along with the varying power of the cards was what detracted from what appeared to be a good component looking game.

I am usually not a big fan of blind-bidding, especially when it's part of a bigger scheme and a wrong-bid will ruin all of your plan. Well, this is a game entirely about blind-bidding, but you do get a lot of options so that there will be ways to make it up for your previous misfortunes. Simple, but well executed design.

This isn't blind bidding;  it's stabbing in the dark with your eyelids sewn shut.  A player who bids in a totally arbitrary manner can foil your plans very easily.  I hated this game so much, I had to beg everyone to stop playing before we finished.  That's something I just about never do.

Basic version (without cards/artifact powers) works very well considering it's basically a blind bidding. I didn't like playing advanced version. Action cards seem to add unnecessary amount of chaos into already a bit chaotic game. The artifact powers didn't seem as much breaking the game but it's not really possible to only play with them and not action cards. I have mixed feelings. I'll give adv. version another try sometime but basic version feels better for some reason.

Essentially two games in one box: play with the "magic" cards if you like a bit more randomness, play without them if you prefer a game of bluffing and misdirection.  Either way, this is an excellent game -- one that rewards good planning but doesn't overwhelm.

Don't be afraid to play without the magic cards; it is still an excellent game without them.  As others have noted, this game is not for those who dislike blind bidding, since it is the central mechanic of the game.

The "jewels" used for currency are some of the best game bits ever, especially the orange one, which looks unnervingly like "chiclet" gum.

(24/04/06) Morgenland speelt vlot.  Een spel waarbij je probeert om via het plaatsen van fiches (waarde tussen 1 en 9 - de 3 ontbreekt) de meerderheid te krijgen in de verschillende plaatsen op het spelbord.  Het is een voortdurend inschatten van de mogelijke zetten van de tegenspelers.  Wie wil wat en is bereid hoeveel te investeren?  De spelregels zijn eenvoudig en in 5 minuten uitgelegd. Het winnen van het spel daarentegen...  Wij speelden de uitgave van 999 Games (handig dat de toverkaarten in het nederlands zijn).  Helaas is dit spel niet meer in produktie.

A personal favourite of mine, even though I hardly ever win for some reason. Blind bidding is just so much fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The blind bidding mechanism is probably the least loved of all mechanisms if you took a poll of gamers - and this game hinges on it. Its saving grace is that the play is fast and the results are entertaining - there is good groan factor. Spice it up with some spells and artifact usage, good components, good artwork - and it comes out smelling ok.

You have 8 tokens - 1, 2, 3-9. With 4 players, there are 13 spaces to contend for and you place your tokens in each, face down, each played in turn, 1 at a time. Each space then gets revealed in turn. First up, there are 5 dragon caves (highest in tokens will collect most treasure from here, there'll be 2nd and 3rd prizes in some caves). Then there are 4 city spaces (highest tokens will respectively get 2 spell cards, or play 2 artifacts, or collect 2 small treasure or move the start player). Then you need to bribe the guard to the palace (ie play enough tokens here to match a random 1-10 value that you don't know beforehand, but you can make up the difference in treasures). If you get into the palace, there are 4 rooms with an artifact in each. Highest in tokens in each room pays that 'tokens bid' amount in treasure to win the artifact. Most artifacts wins.

Revealing one space at a time brings on some interesting decisions, especially once you get to the palace rooms. You get the chance to (generally) play one artifact during the whole round so do you spend your Doubler artifact now to ensure you win those 2 spell cards? Or will you need to play your Key Artifact to get past a high guard to be able to buy more artifacts? Or should you play no artifact in case so you need to play a Counterspell artifact to protect you from another player's evil. If you're competing in two or more rooms in the palace, should you pay for the artifact you can win now without competition ... or risk saving your treasures to pay for the next room, but where you might lose if you didn't bid high enough, but it would stop the other player getting it if you did.

It allows different strategies, there are occasional tough choices, including the double-guessing 'what did he place in there' element. It's still getting pulled out for a whirl once a year.

Based on one play: You are given nine tokens that you must play face down on the board. In most locations the largest sum of numbers wins either the money (in the form of different jewels) or the benefit. You must also collect treasures by placing your tokens and in this instance, even though the largest sum still wins, the player must pay that sum to the bank. Everything is played blind, with the few exceptions when cards modify the play. It is not very exiting and there are much more interesting and engaging bidding games out there.

I liked this game.  There are a lot of rules and little bits and the rules take awhile to get through.  Once you get the hang of it, it's a lot of fun. The only reason this game does not get more table time is that you must have at least 3 players and I often play with just my husband.  After not playing it for many years, I finally cleared it out so someone else could enjoy it.

I don't usually enjoy blind bidding, but in this case, you still have to think carefully about what you're aiming for, what other people could still aim for, and what's available on the board and in your hand.  The artifact abilities and the spell cards complicated the possible outcomes pleasantly without being too unpredictable.  Fun.

RATING: 7
Excellent game.  I always want to use more chips than I have and so the magic carpet early on can be a tremendous advantage.  There is a need for diversity and seat-of-the-pants management as you must adapt to what others are doing.  Some good bluffing elements, too.  The game gets better with repeated plays, but some members of my Thursday group hate bluffing and blind bidding, and they play it badly.  With the right crowd, this game is fantastic.  Despite my enjoyment, there are a couple issues.  First, you have to play the advanced version, or else the game isn't as fun. But, second, the spells are incredibly powerful and absolutely disrupt strategy.  Still, once a player is familiar with the cards, one can prepare for them (like in Evo), plus you can save up a Counter Spell artifact to counter them.  I dunno.  All I can say is I always have fun when I play this.

A good light game with some legs to it. A nice intro to worker placement with use of powers and cards. That and the blind bidding keeps it entertaining for all.
Top tip: take an artefact from each pile blind and return to the box - adds mystery and keeps the length down.

Purchased from Spielmaterial.de ... 14,00 Eur.

Update:  I keep toting this game around but it has yet to have its inagural play.  I have the German version - hans im gluck, so in German I'll bet its excellent, but I'm finding it difficult to translate and therefore understand in order to share and play.  Frick.

Update:  Ok, I've set this thing up and sorta played it, solitaire, and I have a good idea of how it all works.  I really, really wish that I had bought the English version of this, because there is just so much to interpret.  At least I'm improving my German... ?

Update:  Traded in math trade.

This game caught me by surprise. I didn't really know what to expect going in since it was an older game. Scott said blind bidding and I said sure! I like blind bidding and he wasn't kidding. You use tokens 1-9 placed upside down and betting on various actions. Trying to win the bid for the treasures at the top. Clever game and I really enjoyed it. I would like to play this again. If I can pick it up in a math trade I will try to do so!

RATING: 8
I held off buying this one for the longest time, because of all the negative comments from people who despise blind bidding. It's actually a really fun game. Yeah, you overpay often, and get screwed out of stuff even more often, but it's still tense but pleasant, and not really all that chaotic: there is a lot to plan and tough choices to make.
It's rather simple, really. Step 1: get treasures. Step 2: trade treasures for artefacts. Step 3: there is no step 3. So not much depth, but a very pleasant way to spend time. Richard Breese really is one of my favorite designers.

[floatleft][ImageID=253327][/floatleft]Aladdin's Dragons is an excellent blind bidding game and it is a very underrated game on BGG in my opinion. 

The magic "variant" can get a bit out of hand. I've read that this can be mitigated by playing with the magic cards face up for bidding. I will have to try that the next time I play.

Lots of tense interactions with the blind bidding. Spells and counterspell aspects add a random element that may be excessive considering the limited number of artifacts that can be played in a turn (1 except for one player that can earn a 2nd) as well as the very small (basically 6) number of turns.

Very well designed game, though I don't understand why they included dragons  in an otherwise Ali Babba theme.  The components are nice and the board is huge.  The art on the board is a little too cartoony.  I loved how the blind bidding escalates from the dragon's chambers to the palace rooms and all the special powers you can get by stealing the treasures.

My only problem with the game is that intense blind bidding system fill me with such angst that it's hard for me to have fun.

The bidding isn't as blind or chaotic as it seems. High numbers usually end up on the bottom and low ones at the top.

The special action cards seem totally useless when we play since they can easily be cancelled.

There are 2 major problems with this game:
1) That every move is contesting someone else's. The cumulative effect of THAT much personal conflict lowers the overall enjoyment of the game for me. 
2) The massive amounts of decisions required in every round adds up to too much time and thinking for what the game is.  That said, it has a great theme and original mechanics.

Very well executed bluffing game. No down time, you’re always involved in play and the winner is uncertain until the very end. Feels a bit repetitive at times and the magic cards can be strangely ineffective. The lack of control is offset by the tension in the bidding.

I'm not usually a fan of blind bidding but this is really more of a bluffing game. Plays great with the maximum amount of players.
Even though it adds a little randomness to the game, I definitely prefer using the magic variant, as it helps add a little flavor to the bids.
Gotta be careful for those players who manage to take artifacts with a single small token. It's best to play with people who all have an equal understanding of the game or you could have a runaway leader problem.

I like this quite a bit.  It is a "brain space" game where you try and figure your opponents' actions and disregard their bluff plays.

The numerous options each turn keep the secret bidding aspect of the game from getting stale.  You have to constantly assess what you need most each turn and allocate resources to it.  Of course, you must also remember what your ultimate goal is as well.  It's a fun mix of options and strategies.

Original and extremely fun bidding game from Richard Breese of Reef Encounter fame. One thing that I really like about it is that the problems of the bidding mechanism are solved by further bidding. For example, tied bids are broken in player order precedence, and you can bid to choose the starting player. 

The game includes rules for basic and magic versions. Don't bother with the basic version -- the magic version is simple, interesting, and (I think) well balanced. If you're struggling with it, a good way to play spells effectively is to accumulate say four spell cards, throw out a couple of nasty ones (e.g. Sacrifice) to draw out your opponents' counterspells, then cast the decisive spell. Control of the Djinn's House (double artefact) space is mandatory for spellcasting, as it prevents double counterspells being played in the late game. And of course you want to accumulate as many counterspells as possible yourself, to deny them to your opponents. 

Some people prefer playing with the magic cards (the ones that are being bid on) face up. Haven't tried it yet, but it sounds interesting.

The rules have a few ambiguous parts, so check the BGG rules questions and run through a game solo before introducing it to a group. Technically out of print, but copies can still be found.

The potential downsides to this game are the play time, and a slight runaway leader problem (in that your score is equal to the number of artefacts you have, but the artefacts make you more powerful). These can be patched (if they bother you) by removing one artefact per player from the game, and by making artefacts (scores) public. Actually, playing without screens would make the game go down much better with many groups. 

If you're not keen on repetitive blind bidding, you should try before you buy.

Update: Promoted to a 9, as I like this more and more as I get more experience with it. The runaway leader problem is a weakness, but it's just a matter of using open scoring or reminding the players that scores are easily countable.

Lately I'm playing with one spell card face up and the other face down. This gives a basis for bidding without making the cardplay too transparent.

Really nice game to look at. I like Doris Matthäus' graphics a lot. It's a game with a lot of interaction, bluffing and double-guessing. One of the games where the blind-bidding mechanic is a lot of fun. My only problem with the game is, that the games are always really close. One artefact more usually defines the winner when we play it. I'm still looking for ways to screw the other players in a way, that I can dominate surpreme. If I find ways, rating will bump up to 9. :-)

I've had quite a bit of fun playing this game. Wasn't sure about the blind bidding, but this is much more than just a guessing game. It's brutal to get in an expensive fight and lose (much like Taj Mahal), so you have to pick your fights carefully. We play with the magic cards face up, which is a good idea. I don't know that I've played a game with more ambiguities in the rules though. Just terrible.

There seems to be some thought out there that this is some sort of blind-bidding auction game.  That is really not the case.  This game is really an area-control game where your strengths are hidden until the reveal at the end.  This makes the game more understandable for me.  Not that it will make me any better at it as I am terrible at these type games.  However, I do like how the division between gathering, altering, and spending resources were handled.  My biggest initial complaint related to the tie-breaker rule, something I really didn't like.  However, on further reflection, I've concluded that it is not particularly bad, just another factor to consider--an area of risk to be managed.  Unlike many games, you actually do have control over it.  Ignore it at your own risk.  All in all, a pleasant enough game that I would be happy to play again. [10/29/2008]

A nice game, feels like Knizia. Better than Hoity Toity, a less interesting blind bidding games. Basically, the board is a series of auctions, and you lay down all of your bidding chips face down, dividing them among the auctions. Auctions are then resolved from the bottom of the board to the top, with the earlier ones possibly affecting the later ones. Repeat until all of the top four auctions have run out of tiles. If you like that, with a thin veneer of theme on top, you'll like the game.

RATING: 7
Played once with 5P. Aladdin's Dragons is a pretty tense blind-bidding game where bids are spread around different areas of the board. Players are aiming to collect the most artifacts, which incidentally can also be used to assist players throughout the game. There's a clever rule to limit the use of artifacts, which introduces difficult decisions when to trigger their abilities.

The magic spells add even more randomness to the game and are potentially more upsetting, but they are also limited by the artifact rule (as in, a player needs to use Aladdin's Lamp in order to use spells, which rules him out from using other artifacts for the round). There are some niggles regarding the timing of the resolution of spells though.

Given its lightweight rules, Aladdin's Dragons is a surprisingly long and thinky game. The one game I played went into overtime as the final round saw us competing for a single artifact. (That game took us roughly 115 mins, and I won with 9 artifacts on my side.) This is a blind-bidding game done well, if players don't mind the randomness of spells, the fiddliness of spell resolution and the length of the game.

RATING: 6.5
German version, Morgenland.

First off, the bits and boards are gorgeous. Very lavish and no expense spared. The game play itself is ok.

In typical Breese fashion, players are blindly bidding for positions on the board: these translate to currency that will eventually be used to buy artifacts from the Shah's palace.

Players with most artifacts win!

In addition, there are spell cards and artifact abilities to screw the mix up. Artifact and spell card effects are highly imbalanced. Some are rubbish and some are overly useful (this problem also appears in Breese's Keythedral law cards).

The game is a little too repetitive for my taste. I recommend removing some artifact cards to reduce the length of the a typical game.

I played this once and thought it was a decent game. Of course it didn't hurt that I won... The bluffing aspect is fun, but I can see how the lack of information in the game could get a little old after a while. It felt a little like Manilla for some reason. Maybe because of the way you take turns placing your guys, and the way the results are a bit of a gamble.

The cover is horrible, the theme seemed pasted on  (What does Aladdin have to do with dragons).  And a supposed strategy heavy blind bidding game, seemed a bid far fetched.  When I saw this cheap I finally gave in and picked it up. It was truly worth it.  Lots of tough choices, great money management system, wonderful options (from turn order to magic and artifacts), fun interaction, with a touch of the nasty.  Plus the pieces are downright neat.  

Please, please, please play this with the magic cards face up.  The game is much better with the info available.

Highly recommend this.

Well-designed blind bidding game.  Wow, do I suck at blind bidding games.  The mad visceral joy of netting two artifacts in a single round is immediately replaced by the crushing despair of getting shut out of any gems because you tied your bids on every space and don't have the camel.

What a cool game!  I love the blind area control aspect of the game, and the components are really well done, especially the treasures.  I just like how there are so many places to put your pieces, and not all of them can help you achieve your goal of getting artifacts.

This one may actually be underrated, and might need to go up to a 9.

My favourite Richard Breese game and not coincidentally the only one to be redeveloped by a big German publisher. Probably one of the earliest games with a worker placement system and still one of the best. There is some blind bluffing, but that only plays a minor role in my view. I don't play it as often as I used to, but it's still fun to get on the table once in a while.

Nice idea, but I just don't get along with this game. It might work better once everyone knows what they're doing, but having played twice it seems that random plays from inexperienced players can (and do) arbitrarily wreck you. Not an endearing feature in a game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Not quite as fun as I thought it would be but still a good game.  I really like the hidden placement element because it allows for some fun bluffing at times.  I also like the special powers associated with the different locations on the board -- which can make for some tough decisions during placement.  Sometimes I don't like the spells because I feel some of them are just too powerful.  Of course, this just means that getting spells is critical to success, so this problem can be overcome.  This game seems to play better with a larger number of players (ie. > 3).

RATING: 4
I see why it's respected so much, but it just flopped with my group.  Blind bidding has it's place, but not when ties are broken by turn order.  Makes the first player marker more important than the items that are the goal for winning!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Aladdin's Dragons is a very good game that I feel I should like more than I do.  A few things hold it back: the rulebook seems horrendous, and power cards are unbalanced (playing with them face up for bidding makes it better) and there is a *lot* of chaos in a 5 player game.  It is easy to watch one person get screwed again and again.  Still, it has a lot going for it, and I'd like to keep playing to see if it grows on me.

[2 plays] Both plays playing the advanced or "magic" rules.  It was clear from the theme and rule description this is intended to be a family game.  For a family game is does have decent strategy.  It is an alright game.  The blind bidding is pretty cool.  I won't be going out of my way for it etiher though.  It kinds of falls into that hole where if I want to play a strategy game there is so much better to play, if I want to play a family game or something lighter this is just a bit to complex and heavy.

RATING: 6
[RGG 2000 Edition] {Arabian, Fantasy, novel; bluffing, set collection, blind-bidding, area-majority, utility cards; optimal 4p} {basic game 6, 'magic' rules 7} AD is a game with attractive fantasy Arabian theme of spells and artifacts. There are loads of interaction and fun. The core concept is simple: collect treasures greedily, buy artifact cheaply and make opponents buy artifacts dearly.

AD is the best blind-bidding game in my collection. It is a rich game. Players have many agonizing decisions to make - where to place your token, what should one place, when should one place, what resources to collect, etc. It needs clever planning, nice bluffing skill and tactical move to guarantee a winning. It's usually exciting because final score usually differs little. However, AD has a problem of leader-bashing, esp. in 'magic' rules, where players tend to bash the leader heavily; esp. when one plays with open information.  Therefore, I suggest that screen should be used to hide information between players.

The basic game is tactical but dry. The blind-bidding mechanics does not fit the theme nicely.  The 'magic' rule is more fun and thematic because of the spells and artifacts but the game becomes more chaotic. The basic rules are well written and illustrated. However, there are some disputes about the usage of spell cards in the 'magic' rule. The usage of spell cards is not exactly clear but it doesn't hurt the game. The basic game has lower replayability because the only random element comes from the treasure allocation, which is minimal. The 'magic' rule has better replayability due to the spell cards.

The bits are sturdy and pretty. Everything is nice: screen, treasures, artifacts, etc. However, I am afraid of the durability of the tokens; they may wear after many plays.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Rating based on one play.

Good bluffing game with some intriguing ideas, but it's missing something. I don't know what, but it feels incomplete.  I love the way the road leads to each action. I'm sure that this has been done before, but it's the first that I've seen it.

It's also a bit fiddly. Place this chit here, shuffle these chits, flip the chits, play a card, remove the chits, flip a card, place the chicklets,...

Played this recently and was unpleasantly surprised how much it annoyed me. It was more frustrating than fun. Scores are so low that it's difficult to really separate yourself from the pack. Add this to the high chaos level and it just became a huge turn-off. Finally, any plans that *do* manage to sneak past the chaos guard can be thwarted by a single magic card, which can also be thwarted by the umpteen dispell tokens. Why not just throw all the bits in the air and see where they land? Whoever has the most wins. 

And I *like* blind bidding games!!!

This is not a blind bidding game as some may think. Your perspicacity will give you the insight into what people are willing to bid. With the right crowd it's a perfect 10 for me. 

However, it's rare to find a full set of 5 players that really warm to the game mechanics. Some think the cards are too over powered but I think it fits in well with the theme of finding something valuable in bazaar.

Aladdin's Dragons is one of the best blind-bidding games, and it moves fast, too.

One of my favorite bidding games. A lot of tension and choices. Not that there's a LOT of paths to victory as you gotta get the artifacts to win but how you go about getting your money is really the name of the game.  Blind bidding accented with artifact effects and spell cards. NEAT.Update after playing this game over and over for a couple years now it's still a lot of fun due to I love the style of bidding game this is but the game is going to slip to an 8.  Seems like the limited victory paths kind of wears a bit, not much but enough that you start wishing for other things to do in this game.  The center portion of the board also kind of become pointless. The game almost solely becomes bid for gems, bid for artifacts and nothing else. Seems like I'm beating the game up here and I'm not cause it's still a LOT of fun. 

UPDATE:
Upon playing the CRAP out of the game Ys I find I like it much better than this one. This game was purchased first but this type of game is much more efficiently executed in Ys. Ys also eliminates the "gem only" rush in the game. Lowering this game to 7 based on desire to play Ys over this.

  I like the concept of blind bidding. It sure makes the game more interesting. I don't understand all the people who rated it low, that they didn't like the blind biddong. If everybody sees your bid, what's the point of playing the game?! I think there could be more tokens to go for. Because, I got stuck bidding for treasure a lot of times because I got outbid from the previous round, and I needed some treasure to bid for the tokens to win the game. But, that's what makes the game very interesting! You can't rely on one strategy or keep bidding on one thing because others will pass you up in the game!

Only downside is you need at least three people to play.

Just played my first game.  I have played other blind bidding games, and I understand some people's objection to them, but this game did not feel that way.  It felt like there were alot more options because of the artifacts and even with 5 players there always seemed to be something interesting to go for that wasn't being fought over.  The game has a very tense feel because of the room by room reveal and because you often have gamble the success of a later room on the result of an earlier room.  The magic cards have some nasty effects, and I'm glad we used them.

Goal of the game is to get as many artefact ass possible. You get those by paying with treasures. But for every action you want to make, you have to be the highest bidder. You make bids with markers from 1-9, but so that the others players won't see it.

Rated in 2014 after one play. They don't make games like this anymore. Beautiful pieces, quirky 'non-geek' fantasy theme, and oodles of blind bidding. Yep. Lots of blind bidding. A whole game of blind bidding with some worker placement. I love it.

Trouble is, it's hard to get to the table because no one's heard of it and it's not obvious it's part of the 'key' series.

If you're allergic to blind bidding stay far away, but if you're looking for the best blind bidding game well here it is. The lovely artwork and components complement the high tension and clever mechanics to create a wonderful medium-weight gaming experience. This is among my go-to games for getting new people into the hobby. Note: I play with the spell cards face up.

Very pleasant auction game on a nice gameboard. Game is a little bit underestimated. The overcome of the rulesbook is the biggest challenge.

Uno dei miei autori preferiti si cimenta in un gioco di aste nascoste con un tema perfettamente riuscito. Igiocatori cercano ori nelle caverne del Drago, e tentano con questi di acquisire oggetti magici nel palazzo del Sultano.

This is a favorite. I like the creepy silence during placement of the markers, and then the chaotic final round with magic flying in all directions.

The board is pointlessly oversized, but I guess it matches the sumptuous treatment of the exotic setting. Too bad about the stupid dragon theme, as it makes it harder to get to the table for anyone other than my kids.

At first I was reluctant to buying this and after my first game I wasn't going to give it such a high rating. However, with further plays it really has grown on me. Again, great game components, simple rules and tought decisions. For me, the characteristics of a great game.

it would be 8 if there were no magic cards. magic cards are to chaotic and powerful and counter spells would waste to much of your turn.
beside this, a very good game

Set in Arabia, players in this game are competing to steal treasure from Dragon Caves and trade the treasure for magical artifacts.  This game is blind-bidding at its best and a lot of fun.  The rules are quite easy to learn and games are close, with the winner determined by clever choices and bluffing.

Feels like a hand of Poker Bidding, followed by a turn of Cosmic Encounter.

RATING: 7
I liked it far more than I expected to. While it is a "blind-bidding" game, there are enough restrictions on sensical plays, (due to the restrictions of the palace guards and artifact costs), that you end up with some idea of what may be played where. 

Will only play with the "face up magic cards" variant. AS without this the variance in the cards' power makes this too risky to waste a token on, and if someone does get one of the really good ones, they can wipe out your entire turn, without you having any idea that it's coming.

have only played one game with magic cards. did not find that the game held ANY excitement or game angst whatsoever. it seems to me to be a basic bluffing game with no real strategy at all. If this is considered an award winning family game, i'm staying away from that genre in the future! WAIT! After some play now with my 8 yr old daughter, I have bumped it up a couple of notches...the game seems to be getting better after more perseverance...AND (further update) playing against gamers this is more than a reasonable game..glad I have a copy..rating shifts up slightly!
UPDATE: I have severly underrated this game over the years. I love it. It plays quick and I love the bluffing aspect. Fun for everyone.

I don't play this game often enough, which is one of the highest compliments that I can give a game.

It's more fun when played quickly, though, which doesn't happen with every crowd.

Blind bidding over and over. I like it, some don't.

Played a few times (mainly with 4 players). A nice bluffing game with interesting ideas. The variation in values (from 1 to 9) is probably a bit too strong for my tastes, though. I have never played with the spells but should try them next time.

Need to play more and more. So far an excellent addition to my collection.
Update: It was an excellent addition to my collection. Since I didn't play it more than twice I prefered to sold it when I saw the card game.

I enjoyed the single 4 player game I have played. We did have magic cards available, but we thught they were to fussy after the first one was played. I had much better luck using the artifacts.

I normally love games of this nature.  I almost bought this based on the fact that it used a blind bidding mechanic with no other information.  Having said that, this one was fairly disappointing.  The lack of a scoring track or VPs feels very strange, and it didn't feel like the end goal was all that worthwhile.  Might be the bidding game for someone looking for something different.

an excellent game of secret bidding, outguessing opponents and subtlety. less than four and you feel like it&#039;s rock-papers-scissors rather than as deep as it truly is. clever, quick-paced and very fun.

This one is *very* tense and strategic and I just love the agony of choice in the blind bidding.  I haven't had a non-fun game yet, so my rating stays very high.

RATING: 7
A good game with a good theme.  You place tokens repesenting your strength on the board face-down, so the others don't know what the value is.  This leads to a lot of bluffing as you can put one token down with a high strength, or several low value tokens down on the same spot to scare other people away.

I was worried when I had first read about Aladdin's Dragons.  All the blind bidding seemed like a turn-off.  Fortunately, it didn't *feel* like blind bidding.  Yes, you're placing your tokens in various areas, but you can still have a plan and watch it unfold successfully (or, to your detriment if your fellow players happen to ruin it).  Very fun, very cool.  Glad I finally got a chance to play.

After 2+ Plays: I've not yet read the rules (someone else taught me the game), but I'm a little confused as to the actual order of events when multiple players are using magic cards / action tiles.  Other than that this is a very fun game, has great bits, and plays in just the right amount of time for what it is.

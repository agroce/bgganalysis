Berg's cleaned-up regimental system makes this much more user friendly than some of his previous Civil War battles.  Still this is a detailed simulation...long (but worth the effort).

I have played First Bull Run only. I have not tried the bigger battle.

I liked how the chit mechanics can reflect the differences in command abilities between the armies. This is an administrative step that may not appeal to all gamers. Didn't bother me though. The large number of chits to be pulled each turn will allow for the possibility of localized advantages (regarding chit pull order), but not potentially overwhelm the overall situation like in some other games (like AVL with fewer chits pulled each turn). Just a theory.

The latest version of the GBACW is much longer than it's earlier, non-chit cousins I think.

A highly detailed and engaging simulation of the two battles at Manassas.  Unfortunately the rules are extremely dense and needlessly complicated -- they are obviously an accretion of modifications to earlier, simpler games Richard Berg has designed.  Colorful production is marred by the amount of errors, misprints, and obscurities in the game manual and reference cards.

RATING: 10
One of the best, if not the best IMHO, "Manassas" games around.  The system is standardized with Chickamauga, 3DOG, and Gringo making it easy to learn.  I especially like the ability to contrast the performance of both armies in that first battle with the second.

Not for the faint of heart, but very enjoyable to a history buff.  GREAT value for the $$.

The full First Manassas scenario is an excellent two-player game in this system and can be completed within 12 hours.

Another commenter stated "This box title 'Red Badge' could lead to people wrongly thinking that this is a WW2 game."  

Interesting--that's an international perspective I bet the publisher didn't consider.  I hope no one in the U.S. would make that mistake as _Red Badge of Courage_ is a famous Civil War novel by Stephen Crane.

However, I don't think that book is about either battle of Bull Run, though.  Apparently, the battle in the novel is unnamed, but critics think it's based on Chancellorsville.

Another fine game from what you might expect from the GBACW Series. Excellent Counters, Maps and rules. A great game to learn history with as well as a joy to play.

Two battles (First and Second Bull Run) in one game.  Excellent update to the GBACW series introduced by Terrible Swift Sword.  Updated rules take away the bookeeping.  Everything is done with markers on the unit counters. Regimental scale means lots of units and a long time to play.  Chit activation system makes it solitaire friendly.

RATING: 7
Berg's activation chits system breaks the classical rhythm of play and introduce a real fog of war. 
The only fact that Shermann's brigade can play twice or thrice before Jackson's can and that you cannot foresee it makes all the flavour and the realism of this system.
There are two completely different battles in this game (1st and 2nd Manassas). The historical situation is accurately depicted.
Beside this, Berg's rules are always a bit fuzzy and you have to be ready to spend some of your time on house rules...
A great game but only for the ones who like long play sessions with a big map and tons of counters, and who are not frigthened by complicated and somewhat foggy rules.

Great Game!!! Civil War at its best. Berg pioneered the GBACW series with TSS; originally turn based, then to TCT table and now the chit pull system. The chit pull system effects the fog of war nicely as you will not know which brigade is to be activated next. Creates the chaos of the civil war battlefield nicely. Now if only i care to buy 3 days of Gettysburg....but what am i gonna do with my TSS?

Another Berg's design on the American Civil War of GBACW fame.  This is vol.3 in the series.  However, this got me interest not because of his other designs, but because of the game on the same First and Second Bull Run (Manassas) campaigns by Joe Bolkoski's "Stonewall Jackson's Way", which impresses me about the campaign operations. This box title "Red Badge" could lead to people wrongly thinking that this is a WW2 game.  Despite this, it is still a worthwhile to look at how the desginer further streamlined and refined the book-keeping-ridden GBACW system (wich I suspect just to keep the same old name for "magic" or gimmick purpose only).  The regimental scale of the simulation also right on focus for the Civil War as most account of the war was made on this level.

Manassas.  The GBACW system really works well here replicating chaos when orders are lost and activation chits appear at all the wrong times.  This battle is huge though.  I don't think I'll ever be able to finish anything but the shortest scenarios.  Does anyone really have time to do the whole 2nd Battle of Bull Run?  I'd be very impressed.

RATING: 8
I rate this one so high just because of the large number of scenarios that you can play with this game.  There is everything here from battles with only a few turns which are great to introduce new players to large battles with literally hundreds of counters.  The GBACW system continues to improve.

only played once, great game, where are the extras and what happen to the map size?

Update, Just played Brawner Farm scenario with BobD. and AnthonyN. Bob=Union(King), Anthony(Taliaferro) and I(Ewell)=rebs. What a fantastic scenario to play. Short but plenty of action. Union held the road till the end. Which is a great feat considering thier many green units and the rebel force it had to deal with. Can't tell you how the Unions new found Iron Brigade did, but they must have done their job cause they blunted the rebel assault time and again. As far as Jacksons old Stonewall Brigade, their disastered fate was sealed on the first couple of pulls of the first turn. Will definitely play this one again and again.

First Manassas, full battle
just finished playing with AnthonyN. who played the rebs. 
I posted some pics on consims world, so you can follow.
Game began as usual, all units, manuevering for position and making there way on to the map. first blood was drawn by bg.evans, 1st la. tigers on bg.burnsides, 71st. ny. the battle continued this way for several turns as more and more units moved to the sound of the guns. mcdowell playing it close to the turn in bullrun creek and drawing in the rebs. waited until mg.tylers division got activate. after activation both ford and bridge were taken from bg.cocke one after the other causing the rebs to be out flanked. which in turn made the rebs to concede the battle field to the union.

Another advanced Berg designed game that's a tad more complicated than I like but will satisfy the Grognard.

Malgré la thématique vampire/chasseurs, j'ai vraiment eu l'impression de joué a Loup-Garou mais avec différentes cartes. Au moins, le processus d elimination est plus long. La partie se termine dès qu'il y a quelqu'un de tuer, ou qu'il y a 5 morsures distribuées.

Very fun, with several options (Rituals, clock, etc). This is a good party game option for your collection (with Resistance and Coup for example).

RATING: 6
A decent social deduction game. Like The Resistance, a subset of players will be active each turn and deductions can be based on the results of their actions. It suffers in comparison because player actions are at the mercy of random card draws and because it leaves one player - Renfield, Dracula's ally - with little to do.

The artwork is nicely evocative and production standards are decent.

It was ok with 6 players and I prefer werewolf with a moderator over Renfield, which seems a bit boring to play.
We played one rule wrong: The stake holder (not Renfield) must reveal one character card if nobody got bitten, which makes the role of Renfield even less attractive.

Interesting deduction game, very much in the werewolf mode but with only one vampire player and a single-use killing device for the villagers.

Downrated after the second play with fewer players (6) because it is just too hard for the vampire when the odds are in favour of being in a small group of people when the bite is played. I wasn't the vampire in this game but the deduction just became too easy.

Essen 2013.  This is a well thought out variant of werewolf which vastly improves the information available, and thereby sharpens the decision making, though retaining a healthy level of bluff and double-think. Not really my favourite sort of game but I enjoyed this.

Interesting deduction game with a great theme. A little messy though : it's not very intuitive and the end can be harsh sometimes.

RATING: 4
A game of the hunters versus a secret vampire plus his known assistant (Renfield). I like some of the ideas such as the ritual cards, the various outcomes of the action deck and the clock determining how many cards are added to it but found the role of Renfield to be quite dull. Renfield's job is really just to decide every so often who to give the stake to (starts the round and may decide if to use it on someone) and who to assign the bite cards to (loses a card from their hand).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
I enjoy the clock mechanism in this one. The hunters have won in all my plays, making this one feel lopsided, but I feel this had to do more with individual players' strategies than the game itself.

Party game para até 8 pessoas, muito divertido, de intrigas, mentiras e times, onde os Caçadores querem encontrar o jogador que é o Vampiro, e a única pessoa que sabe de tudo é o Reinfield, que é do time do vampiro, logo, sempre que puder, vai mentir para ajudar a esconder a identidade dele.

RATING: 8.5
A quick and fun cooperative game (with traitor). Unlike other games of the genre, Nosferatu puts the essence (who is the traitor?) forward in an extreme manner. Everything is concentrated around the very question. That makes the game very quick and very dense.

The moment when players really need to decide who the traitor is comes very fast. Then heated discussions start...

What more can we ask from a game than to concentrate the essence of its genre?

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Another hidden traitor game. Very group dependent, but if you like resistance, you'll probably like this. It can drag because it's hard for the vampire to get five bites (we play four) and it's hard for the hunters to get all the incantations. So the best chance for the hunters is to make a good guess and hope they get it right.

Players are either vampire hunters, Dracula, or Dracula's assistant, Renfield.  All roles are hidden, apart from Renfield, who also knows who is Dracula.  The players take turns drawing cards from a deck, discarding one openly, and passing one in secret to Renfield.  When the sun rises, Renfield scoops up his cards and applies a result based on what he's been passed - ranging from biting the other players to invoking a hunter special ability.  The hunters may then choose to stake a player, or keep playing.  If they stake Dracula, the hunters win.  If they stake a hunter, Dracula/Renfield wins.  If Renfield can distribute 5 bites amongst the players, Dracula/Renfield wins.

Fun game - very much in The Resistance/Werewolf style, and with no player elimination.  Different enough from both of those games to be well worth a look.  Liked it.

Really fun, easy-to-teach, little deduction game. Moves quickly and stays tense. Absolutely recommend if you're into Resistance/Coup/Werewolf style games as it's different enough from them.

RATING: 4.5
Hidden identity game where Dracula is hidden amongst the investigators but his assistant Renfield is known.

Very difficult for Dracula to actually win as he needs to get five bites to the table, but since each night is of variable length he may not even get the opportunity to even add a card to the check, or the night may be so short it becomes obvious who is in fact Dracula.

There is opportunity to sow a little distrust and hope the investigators stake the wrong person thus getting a win for Dracula however in practice the investigators tend to delay staking someone unless they are absolutely sure.

A hidden identity game in the tradition of Werewolf but with something more than just intuition to base your suspicion on. Unfortunately, it is also highly dependent on card draws as you cannot do much if you draw the wrong cards. Not very interesting for Renfield, either. Okay as a quick filler for bigger groups but strictly inferior to Resistance, for example.

RATING: 7.5
This is a party card game that mixes tactics, with bluffing, deduction and team play(Nosferatu and Renfield against the vampire hunters), in a way that everything makes thematic sense. Sure there are a lot of games in this genre but i think that this is an underrated one that needs more attention, coz it is somehow  unique(with those mechanics mixed together).
Overall i really recommend this one if you have a nice group of friends(it plays best with 7 or 8 in my opinion).

RATING: 7
This game is not as good as the Resistance but it's still a solid and enjoyable game.  Its fast, easy to teach and the vampire theme is quite interesting, and the mechanic with a known "vampire servant" that chooses its master permits to avoid this awkward "close your eyes" moment.
Certainly a game we pull out when we have more than 5 players.

A lot more shallow than say "The Resistance" for example and really picky concerning player counts (it only works reasonably well with seven) but it's biggest pro is that you can get it on the way pretty fast and it gives you information to work with from the get-go. False information sometimes, since there's a lot of luck of the draw, but there's at least something backing the accusations you'll inevitably start slinging left and right. Sadly, tends to drag sometimes.

Nosferatu seems like a good game, however the player who read the rules was very inexperienced so he explained them wrong. I need to read the rules and play Nosferatu again this month. From what I saw, Renfield has the best role of the game :D.

The art of the cards is ok.

I will comment further when I play the game again but I have high hopes. I like hidden role games.

I finally played Nosferatu again :D. It is unbelievable, but last time the game was explained with 90% of the rules wrong. 

Nosferatu is a fast paced hidden roles game. I like that Renfield chooses which player will be Dracula, in this manner I was Dracula twice (In The Resistance almost always I´m a good guy, In Spyfall I have been the spy twice :/) and it is always more fun to be the traitor in the game.

It is fun when the dawn card appears, it control how long the night can be. If it is a short night it can hose Dracula (if it appears too early after he played) and when it appears it opens the door for someone (the stake holder) to kill a player so it is this moment when there is a heated and fun discussion. In all my games, the hunters weren’t even close to achieve 5 rituals nor Dracula 5 bites, it always ended with someone staked and I love this.

I like the theme.

Bottom line, a fun hidden roles game. For now I will keep in in my game collection and I plan to play it again soon.

[thread=1564514]Yet another team social deduction game.[/thread] It's interesting and different enough from most other such games. It's incredibly dependant on the luck of the draw, though. As good a bluffer as the vampire may be, a bad and unexpected dawn card can pretty much end the game. The last couple times I played it, I found out that games can drag.

Played once.
Two players against everyone else.  Everyone knows Renfield, but who is Dracula?
There will always be unlucky card draws, and that was my experience in this game.  I can see the possibilities in this game, and think it could be wonderful, but I won't score it until I've had a few more plays.

RATING: 4
Very interesting game, but it seems stacked against the nosferatu and renfield characters, at least in 6p. Maybe we were just unlucky but we never had more than two bites, and we had plenty of advantage from what I could tell. It probably matters the players too.

I love that Renfield chooses the traitor. Brilliant! I love social deduction (even though I am terrible at them), and found this one different, but its still a bit flawed IMO. 

As Renfield, you don't really get to do anything either. And it seems like once you have a lie, you can gradually eliminate candidates for the vampire. Not a good sign in a social deduction game.

Excellent alternative to The Resistance. One player is Renfield, and moderates. Each other player secretly plays one card each round - Renfield examines the set and announces whether Dracula's agenda has progressed, if nothing has happened, or if they are close to catching him.

One player is secretly chosen to be Dracula, and he tries to get "bite" cards into the collection played each round. The other players are all trying to find Dracula and stake him. If all the cards played are Investigation Equipment, they are one step closer...

Start player varies each round, as does the number of cards played. Drac has to be canny, and sometimes play against himself in order to throw ff suspicion.

Drac wins if he bites five times or they stake the wrong person. The [-]cattle[/-] villagers win if they get Drac.

Underrated hidden role game. Doesn't always work - best played with people who get into the spirit of the game and roleplay a bit, and sometimes the game can be over quickly and anticlimactically, but we've had plenty of really fun, tense games.
 
The night/dawn card mechanism is particularly cool, creating a suspenseful moment on every turn. And when you're on the Renfield-Dracula team, getting a hunter to stake the wrong person is always immensely entertaining :devil:

RATING: 9
only 1 negative: the rulebook is written badly for such a simple game
positives:
-This is by far the best version of games like The Resistance, Warewolf etc. That is because in my opinion, it offers as much as all the other games if not more (variety of day and night cards  to shorten rounds and achieve all rituals to win) but is also more compact than the rest, which is great for such a game play.
-The theme appeals to many people too and is very easy to teach.
-It is always fun to see people taking their character cards, then start shouting: You are the vampire! No, you are!......and so on. It makes every playgroup go wild.
-Definitely recommend for all collectors. Do not bother with the other games, unless you prefer the themes over this one.

Owned, and into my collection!

Werewolf style deduction games are not my favorite as they are highly group dependent. But with the right group they can be great. This game is kind of different in it's execution as it uses cards heavily. In such a way in fact that you could play without any table talk. I can't imagine that being fun, but you could. But I feel that it otherwise provides a nice werewolf style experience for even a limited amount of players. It also seems like games will usually be quite close between the vampire and the hunters winning.

Initial rating: 6.6

To be fair: I didn't play this myself but I followed every move my friends made so it was like playing myself.

To be fair, I have to say that I am no big fan of secret identity games. Especially of they involve a lot of verbal negotiation. It is no surprise then, that I am not a big fan of Werewolves. Castle Of The Devil is better, because there is more "game" to it. Nosferatu really holds the middle ground between these two games, and it plays quite quickly. Its biggest drawback is the big element of luck that stems from drawing the sunrise card. If it turns up too fast in a couple of rounds, it can become really easy to deduce who the vampire is. For me, the game is passable, but nothing special.

very enjoyable party game in the same vein of werewolf/resistance (so I will compare the 3)

in my opinion, it does better than werewolf because:
no player elimination, in-game clues (not only lying/talking)
but doesn't do as good as resistance, because:
accommodates less players, gameplay can be hindered by the cards (vampire needs to draw some bites to keep things interesting; if all turns are long/short, one side has a strong advantage)

[+] micro box that you can bring everywhere, 3 different experiences (hunter, vampire and assistant), variable round duration is very interesting, several ways to hide/get clues in game (who gives 'first player' to whom, who gets bitten, who gets revealed, who discards what, etc.)
[-] vampire's play is very dependent on cards drawn, if it doesn't draw bites, it can play any, and will even be punished for not biting anyone for a while...

Hidden role game, where Dracula is hiding among the hunters while he tries to manipulate his lackey to deal out bites. Each round, players draw cards and hand one of them to the lackey. Dracula will wan't to hand in BITE cards, but musn't be too obvious. Because the length of the rounds is variable, Dracula can never be sure that his card can't be traced back to him. 
Fun concept, but a single game contains a lot of rounds where nothing happens.

Fun game, but ultimately I'm not sure the 15 minute gameplay will warrant the extensive setup time.  Got it 1/2 price at B&N clearance and Kelly enjoyed our 2 plays.

I like it, although it's definitely not a "thinking" game.  I mean, you are kinda timed, so you figure out a plan, start the timer, and then see what happens.  Or freak out and lose horribly.

Zombies and coop's are soooo played out. BUT, this is a good one. My only complaints are the set up (though, if you play multiple stories the map shifts around easily) and the soundtrack doesn't build to a grand cadence...it just......ends. We played a full minute before we noticed the music had stopped.

RATING: 8.4
Super fun, frantic timed zombie missions using teen characters that are all colorful and have their own unique abilities and restrictions. Normally I don't go out for timed play, but along with Escape! this is an exception, since a few passes through and you'll pick up on what you've gotta do. Components are great, tons of zombies in the box, a lot of tiles to rearrange into different scenarios. Rules are fast to pick up on, elegant and make sense, especially the easy encumbrance and duration mechanisms. Only downside is that 15x15' scenarios might not give you a lifetime enjoyment, especially in this one L.A. environment, but it would be pretty easy for them to expand it with just more tiles and scenarios. Anyway, another great zombie title that is unlikely to leave my collection.

RATING: 7
Light, quick, timed/real-time game of zombier killing and running around in a small town! The soundtrack invokes feeling of dread, the zombie growls make zombies appear out of nowhere and nothing is worse than a horde descending on you 2 tiles away from the exit! Fun for gamers and casual gamers alike, but setup time rivals play time

I am totally out ot the zombie thing, but this is a funny and tense real time game that could actually be set in a different theme (although it is clear that zombies fit).  15 minutes, real time, to escape of a city filled with undead.

Real-time cooperative campaign zombie survival game. Fun real time game with less chaos than Escape for sure, enough meaningful decisions to make it fun. However, the game setup is such a pain that it makes it very unlikely to hit the table often. The setup time is almost as long as the gameplay itself since it's 15 minutes at most. Only worth setting up if plan to play a few games in a row. So far, it's still quite an easy real time game but that's probably cause I've only completed till level 4.

Very fun, very stressful co-op. It's like a more deterministic Escape: Cures of the Temple (though the music is better!). 

Set-up time is onerous and quite possibly the biggest barrier to playing the game very often. If this one element was made faster and easier, I'd play this much more frequently.

I was only slightly let down by this game.  It is really good.  It didn't quite live up to the hype, but almost.  I love real-time co-ops.  See Escape above.  Sometimes this one does not feel like it has the correct amount of tension.  Other times, it nails it.  Set up time is also a drag.

Real time cooperative zombie survival game. Kill of zombies as you make your way through the streets of the city in order to complete the scenario objective. Search for weapons and items along the way. While it tests cooperation, organization, and quick-thinking (it's real-time), it doesn't require a great deal of interesting decision-making. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Simplistic gameplay so far with the prologue parts 1 and 2. No dice, just a set number of actions, asynchronous turns, real time cooperative game. Would have to play more scenarios from the campaign to see how good the game is.

Better than Escape due to campaign mode, but not sure on the depth of gameplay or replayability yet.

Played twice. A fun game that starts off simple and layers on complexity as you play through the campaign. Map setup is a little bit of a pain, so plan on playing 2-3 15 minute games when you set up. The soundtrack is fun. You'll probably get about 20-25 plays out of this, then be done with it.

This game has surpassed Escape as our real time game of choice. Everything about it is better save the setup time. The decision making is not as meaningful and in depth as say Agricola or Through the Ages, but it is not supposed to be. There are plenty of ways, however, that your decisions influence the outcome of the game. This is especially true in later scenarios when the difficulty gets more intense. Item and group management do become important if you want to win. The first few scenarios are very easy and the game adds rules as you go along, so my advice is to play through at least the first 5 scenarios before passing judgment. 

I will post some more comments on replay ability and longevity after I finish the campaign the first time. Also do note the setup takes about as long as the game. This is probably the only knock I have so far. On the positive side I played with my teenage daughter and she requested again the next night and stated it is her new favorite game. I also played with my 40 year old gaming buddy and he loved it, so it does appear that it will appeal to a wide audience within my circle.  

Update: 20+ plays and the game is still great. I introduced to another group and they all loved it. So I have now played with 3 different groups and have not seen 1 negative comment. Also, I have started just using like tiles during the setup instead of doing it exactly as prescribed in the book. This actually cuts at least 5 minutes off the setup and if I lay the tiles while someone else readies the zombies, chits, and deck we can have it all setup in around 5 minutes. 

UPDATE: The setup time keeps this game from hitting the table as much as it should. It also suffers from the fact that once a good strategy is developed it lessens the tension. There should have been fewer big Zombicide sized tiles which would have made setup loads easier. I am actually more likely to play Escape now just because of the setup time even though I like this game better.

This is a controversial game for a lot of people but I think that is primarily because it is misunderstood! It's not a zombie combat game or an Ameritrash story engine (though technically, those elements superficially exist). 

It's largely a Euro hybrid, with a strong theme, great mechanics and interactivity under pressure.

It's a strange little hybrid game with a constantly shifting problem matrix that necessitates strategic flexibility under pressure. When you're playing this game right, you're best laid plans are getting destroyed by poor card draws, meaning that you must improvise new solutions and create new strategies on the fly - usually with crappy options!

Some people game for that sensation of excellence when you've optimized a set and stable universe and can peacefully watch the game run like clockwork. THAT IS NOT THIS GAME!

Some gamers are irritated when fellow players make mistakes. They may not enjoy this game (or life, in my opinion.)

Some gamers hate to have great strategies upended by bad luck! That will happen in this game - OFTEN!

But if you can appreciate the last ditch, duck-taped together solution that no one saw coming, with seconds on the clock - this is a game you will want.

This game is brilliant and innovative because, when push comes to shove, it replicates a compelling and dramatic dynamic found in real-life: Team solution building under timed pressure. When I'm with people who die because of the alpha gamer barking commands that are wasting precious seconds, or because someone is too busy angsting over their blown plan, it just underscores the greatness of this game. 

There is nothing else like it on the market.

I may like this game's mechanics a little more than Escape: The Curse of the Temple, but what makes Escape the better game is it's setup and ease. Setup, for campaign scenarios, kills this game right out of the gate. When it takes 10-20 minutes to setup the map, and roughly about 8-10 minutes to beat it, you have a problem. Yes I understand you can play the same scenarios 3 or 4 times in one sitting, but that's not a solution, just a workaround to the problem.

The game might be best played with random setup, over its campaign style to prevent this(and thankfully there are rules that explain how to do so). Regardless of which way you play, the game is still pretty fun and the intensity is definitely evident during play.

Watched the gameplay video as I got curious when checking out some last minute KS games. Takes the main ideas from Space Alert and Escape which are playing real-time co-op against a sound track backdrop. There is about the same amount of "game" here as in Escape, and about the amount you have come to expect from a Zombie game (move, kill, rinse, repeat so repetitive too). 

I don't think the tension is as high as Escape, but I could be wrong on this one. Looks like about a 6 or so for me, might be fun for a couple games but no need to own and probably a $35 game not a $70 no matter how well its produced.

RATING: 8.5
A fun and fast zombie co-op game played in real time.  Components are great and the rules are easy to grasp.  

15 different scenarios with increasing difficulty slowly ease you into the game mechanics when played in order.  Lots of room for more print and play/custom made scenarios.

Set up can take a little while for a game as lite as fast as this, but It's not nearly as bad as many of the heavier board games.

The only big negative is with a game as quick paced and frantic as this, it can be very easy to forget about special rules or mechanics.  In the heat of the moment it's very easy to forget your character can't equip firearms or can't be healed.

Overall a very fun game that keeps every player engaged at all times, even when it's not their turn.

Real time zombie game where the goal changes depending on the mission. Each character plays slightly differently (once you've progressed past the prologue) so there's some choice as to what to bring on the mission. Each mission is 15 minutes and depending on the difficulty will cause zombies to spawn every minute or every 40 seconds.

It's a basic action system where you get 4 actions per turn and you have to decide what to do with them and execute them as fast as possible. This can get a bit hectic as you kill zombies, put zombies in the horde box, listen for growls to spawn more zombies, and move minis around. Definitely make sure all components are in reach of everyone.

Doesn't really play well at 2 players as you have to control 2 characters and while time is ticking it's quite easy to get confused between characters.

It is a fun game and will see a fair amount of play with the right group but I'm not entirely sure about it's longevity.  We're already getting a bit too used to the core strategy of the game.  There is also a bit of fiddly set up that is not inconsequential between scenarios.

This is my favorite board game to date.
Let me start with the downsides; price, limited scenarios out of the box, the setup time is longer than the game, there are TONS of pieces which only a small portion are used in any given game, the minis are less detailed than I would like (but I prefer this to it being a $100+ game) and the arm on the fat zombies has gaps, the players need to understand the game up front or you will waste precious seconds asking what they can/should do or making errors others need to explain why they are not possible, and if you do not have exactly 4 players the game is not as good.

Now, if you can get around those notes; this is a top fun-factor board game that will get your blood moving.  Time is a factor, resource management is critical, teamwork must be balanced with divide and conquer on a game-by-game strategic level, and decisions must be made quickly, and it's just plain fun! 
To top that off, the box is loaded; 108 minis, 36 double sided map tiles, there are TONS of optional tokens, and the printed materials make sense (ie. one sided and two sided equipment cards to speed up post-game sorting).

I can't want to see challenge maps/layouts start showing up online!

I loathe rolling dice in real time. I truely can't understand the appeal of it. For some time that seemed to be the dominant mechnism in the category of real time games though. So the lack of rolling dice and just being forced to make quick moves and decisions is what drew my to Zombie 15'. The game is fast, tense and forces the players to cooperate. If you don't help each other out, you'll lose. The setup my seem to long for a 15 minute game, but I think you can cut it a little shorter by good organization and a little time to wind down between two session isn't really a bad thing for me.

Fast and fun realtime game. The characters feel unique and finding a cool weapon by searching buildings is integrated well. My complaint about the game is set up takes more time than it should be for a 15 minute game and the letters for the tiles are so small it is quite hard to differentiate the tiles. I want to play the campaign once to have a further opinion about the game.

RATING: 7.5
A panicked frenzy of zombie killing and scouring for new weapons to do more zombie killing!  This is a timed (15 minutes) cooperative game where you play a bunch of teenagers running around town to accomplish various missions that always include having to take out hordes of zombies.  You play a soundtrack while playing and every minute a zombie growl will sound and you empty the horde box of zombies on the board where the current player is.  The horde box is something of a hot potato that you don't want in your lap when that growl sounds!  The horde box grows as the characters in the game use noisy weapons.  Makes for a nail-biting and frenetic adventure!

I have to admit I backed Zombie 15' at the last second, and I was thinking about just trading the game away before even playing it. Then I played a full demo of the game at GenCon 2014 and I have to tell you that if it wasn't for a very strong crop of games this year this game would have probably won my [b]Game of the Con[/b] award. The game is frantic as you are playing in real time, and in 15 minutes at that. Game play is pretty simple which was an obvious design choice considering the real time and time elements that exist in the game. You run through a town fighting zombies looking for weapons and other items, fighting more zombies and if you are lucky surviving to fight another day. Like most people I am running on zombie fatigue, but this design feels so fresh that I honestly didn't even feel that fatigue the whole time I am playing. The game is too hectic to even contemplate zombie fatigue, you just have to keep fighting those zombies. Between this and Dead of Winter maybe the zombie genre has something still left to give the gaming world. Bravo Zombie 15' for giving that extra shot of vitamin Z I needed.

RATING: 7
Es kommt Stress auf, es macht Spaß, nur sollte man es dann auch 2-3 mal hintereinader spielen, weil sonst der Aufbau-Aufwand zu groß ist um 15 Min Spaß zu rechtfertigen.
Wer am Zug ist hat 4 Aktionen zur Verfügung (laufen, Waffe einsetzen um Zombies zu killen, suchen im Haus, Aufstehen wenn man letzte Runde angegriffen wurde). Parallel läuft eine CD, die alle 60 Sekunden sagt, dass neue Zombies auftauchen. Beim Suchen tauchen Neue auf. Beim Krach machen sammeln sie sich... und und und.
15 Minuten permanenter Stress, weil man seine 4 Aktionen so schnell wie möglich durchziehen will um nicht. Wenn man bis dahin nicht durchs Ziel ist hat man verloren.
Ich mag Echtzeitsspiele echt gerne. Bei diesem ist der Aufbauaufwand sehr groß, wesshalb man schon 3-4 Szenarien am Stück spielen sollte (Es ändert sich von einem zum nächsten Scenario nicht viel auf dem Brett, nur anfangs ist es viel). Es wird sogar eine kleine Geschichte erzählt, wie die Freunde zusammen finden und das Lobor finden um am Ende vor dem dicken Überzombie zu stehen.

Great game with a great theme and an almost unique mechanic. Sure, it has some flaws, starting from the easy mess that any game can rapidly turn into if you can't pay the required attention to all the various mechanics at once (searchs and zombie cards in the first place). Moreover, i got the impression that if you got 3 players, it's better to just hand an extra character to one of them, instead than play three characters with an extra action. I suspect that the lack of the two extra weapons of the missing fourth character really hit the math of the game.

As a sidenote, it would really be nice to include a rule that allow players to use special objects in a single game. I have already decided that, when you pick a bag instead of a key, you can draw one special objects with the relative number.

Don't play with people who panic under pressure - or do, and expect to lose! This is a tense game, which delivers. Big failing is for your 15 minutes of adrenalin, you get another 15/20 mins to set up. Hardly feels fair. This alone makes it less appealing to get out and introduce to new friends. It spends more time in our cupboard than I'd like it to because of this.

Zombie 15 is a real time cooperative game for 2-4 players that requires very fast decision making and keeps the stress level high. Although no dice are used, the game is highly luck based as players need to search every few tiles for new weapons. Lots of scenarios available but they pretty much all feel the same. Escape would be a much better choice for casual gamers.

I received this game as a gift from a friend.  I really don't like zombies but I thoroughly enjoyed this game.  I think that says a lot.  It's fun, intense, and quick.  You really have to be on your feet in this game and can't think too hardly about the weapons you find because they will wear our quickly and you gotta get rid of the zombies quickly.

I will say though, setting up the game can take longer than the actual gameplay.

As other said, great mix between Zombicide and Escape: The curse of the temple.

Compared to Zombicide, the game doesn't suffer from an experienced player telling others what to do, you don't have the time to do so. But the decisions are also easier to make, hence there are less meaningful choices. 

The game has corrected the shoot your ally first rule of Zombicide, which is good and the play time is usually way faster. The setup time of both game is similar, but you setup the game every 15 minutes in Zombie 15' compared to around every hour in Zombicide, which can be an annoyance for some people.

The components in Zombicide (zombies, map, token, etc...) are more detailed and the game looks better imho.

Compared to Escape, Zombie 15' is a little less stressful, as you have time to relax and take a breath between your turns, but more complex in terms of the options and choices you have to make. The game looks better, but is less intended for general public. If you are searching for a quick, easy to understand and setup game, you better go with Escape. It is more of a family game then Zombie 15'.

In general, those three games are all excellent ones and all have their places in the top co-op game I believe.

Finally, as a fan of co-op in general, I would highly recommend Zombie 15' for it's fun, it's theme, it's re playability and the fast playtime (if you take off the setup time).

Played 60-65 times.

Wow, a great game to play with the son (9 years). We´ve played 16 times and managed scenarios 1-7 so far. The tension is great. I don´t think the set-up time is that bad, and when playing with kids it becomes part of the fun. You just need to be aware that while the playing time is always 15 minutes, the set-up adds quite some time. Great progression between scenarios. My one small problem with the game is that the pressure adds a lot of atmosphere but also takes some away. You simply do not have the time to picture yourself knocking down zombies with a banjo, you just go Move, Kill 2 - one in the box, Move, Search, 2 Zombies, Take Gun, Go!

RATING: 8.5
This game is a masterpiece. Zombie game with euro mechanics and realtime gameplay, I love it! This year was good one for overused zombie theme, Dead of Winter captures the paranoia and selfishness very well, and this one handles more light-hearted action side perfectly. It's also one of the best realtime games I've seen, it's way less complex than Space Alert (my other favorite) and it has more fun decisions than Escape for example. Sure at its heart it's really yet another Pandemic type of action point co-op, but you'll be so captured by the frantic decision-making  that you won't notice. Only real minus is the setup time, but there's no real solution that designers could've made, except non-random board..

As the name suggests this timed Zombie game is played in 15 minute sessions. Players will race to finish each mission, all the while replacing damaged weapons and killing Zombies. The addition of a soundtrack CD is fun and thematic and the miniatures are pretty good. Where this really succeeds is by being appealing to people who don't like the theme whilst still retaining it's thematic feel.

5 - 01/11/2015 - Maybe one game isn't enough for the last vote, and one game at a convention with the "wrong" group isn't even more. However, what impressed me of this title is the quantity of miniatures and materials in front of a gameplay that is super-simple, with a very limited amount of choices that are practically forced by the situation: if you have ammo, then kill the zombies; if you lack ammo, then look for them. For my tastes, this is much closer to a too semplified but expensive videogame than a boardgame.

A very nice attempt to create a real time version of an RPG dungeon-crawler style of game.

Fun premise -- a lot like Escape in terms of time pressure and related "excitement." Set up, however, is a huge pain. It often takes as long or longer to set up the game tiles, etc. as the game itself. Also, there are too many "clear choices" that each player had to make during his/her turn. No real options to explore. That makes gameplay a lot more boring than it should be. The theme is good, although even I'm sick of zombie games at this point. Seriously. Let's move on.

I'm SO torn on what to rate this. On one hand, this is definitely my favorite real time board game that I've played. It's much better than Escape, and not nearly as convoluted as Space Alert. On the other hand, I'm not really a fan of this genre all that much. I am, in theory, but I'm still waiting for that game to come along that is as light and breezy as Escape, but still has some meat on the bone. Captain Sonar has potential, but the player count means that I would probably never get it played. Zombie 15' comes very close, but I wish that there was something about it to shove it over the line into heavier territory.

I really like the game though. So much so that I'm considering keeping it. I love the deterministic actions, the way the soundtrack and searching help to keep the tension high, turn-taking to discourage any possible cheating, and how there are so many different weapons to utilize. Also, what a cool theme! Zombies have been mostly done to death, but I really like that they made this game about misfit kids who are just trying to survive in the apocalypse. It kind of feels like a Shaun of the Dead-like scenario, but without nearly as much humor.

I think I'll hang onto this for now, but I'm not sure how often it will come out due to the fact that I know very few people who enjoy games with a timed element. As a solo game, however, this is excellent. Just make sure to play with the difficulty high so it isn't too much of a pushover.

---

UPDATE: Got my first loss on the third scenario. Came right down to the wire. Somehow losing this game made it better for me. I always felt like Escape was a pushover, but this game at least has some fangs to it, and it didn't feel like I lost due to dumb luck. The setup time is a bit of a chore, and I don't know how often I'll want to go back through scenarios I've already played, but this game is just plain, stupid fun. I still don't think I've found my favorite real time game, but this one comes very close.

This game comes with a wonderful campaign that takes you through a beginner game and progresses from game to game through a zombie story.
My first impression when I set up our first game was how much it reminded me of playing the video game Dead Island. It looks like you are on some resort tropical island with zombies everywhere.

Set up the board with zombies usually in almost every space on the board. Next turn on the CD and quickly take your actions (move, fight, pick up stuff). It all happens very fast. You can't stop and take your time in this game. Fire your gun at a zombie, move your bullet slider down, fire again...weapon used up. Throw it out! Search in the building for another weapon...pick up three cards from the deck...one is a sweet sweet axe...the other two 3 more zombies added to your space. And so it goes...until maybe you make it to the survivor stopping point or the CD track finishes at which point you lose.

This is a real time (soundtrack driven) co-op zombie smashing game for up to players. It's really great having a soundtrack driven game that's diceless. Essentially, in the game each player gets 4 actions, which could be move your meeple, kill zombies or search for items. When the soundtrack growls, more zombies spawn on the active player. The different scenarios in the book change things up reasonably well, and as the game progresses you add more elements making things more challenging. I particularly like the tower defense style level.

I can't help but feel a little disappointed that the story has no ending in the base game, it just leaves off. They've released the end in a downloadable extra set of levels, which is... fine.

A better game than Escape. Turns make it less chaotic but it still maintains a high level of tension. It's also less susceptible to player rules mistakes. Feels like Zombicide condensed.

Setup is tedious and takes as long as playing the game. Also the health and tracking tokens are too small. They are easily bumped during the frantic gameplay. I replaced mine with wooden disks.

I already love the game after a few plays. So much to explore in this with 15 scenarios(13 since the prologues are just training), and with 5 additional scenarios coming to the website(kick-starters got their 5 bonus already). You need to play at least a couple games without special abilities of the heroes to keep things simple. Start with the beginner level scenarios, the prologue scenarios seem to be a bit too simple. The game gets quite hectic after a few turns when zombies start to pop up and everything doesn't go as planned. Every rule makes sense and is there for a good reason. The horde mechanic is just awesome. Really exciting and fun to play. This is like a fast paced Zombicide with much more exciting and immersive thematic experience.

Final edit. Sold away. The setup is a bit too long for random play. There should also be more scenarios available and more things to spice up the game. The box is huge and rarely hit the table.

Cool game. But, it takes longer to set up the board than it does to play the game. After less than 15 minutes, you have to set up the next round which takes a lot of setup time. I ened up selling the game. I've also been waiting well over a year for my Kickstarter sweetners that have taken way too long. Great art, cool company, but I will never fund another one of their Kiackstarter projects.

I bought this on sale and the intrigue of big box + art.  I heard that you can spend more time setting it up than the actual time playing it.  Hopefully I'll be able to play this soon.

**A good game that could be great if it wasn't for the scenario setup**

7. Good.

The 17 plays is a single playthrough of the campaign with replays of failed scenarios included. We blitzed through this in 2 days and had a blast.

It's going to take a certain crew to play this one, as the set up is laborious, the play is timed and the theme is zombies.

Given another day, in the right mood, I'd replay the campaign. Given another campaign? Yes, please!

This game is definitely more on the frenetic side as opposed to the strategic side. The setup is frustratingly long and can take as long if not longer than a single round of play. Your choices are pretty limited when you really think about, but this is a game for when you don't really want to think.

RATING: 7
Frantic real time co-op game. Everybody is constantly involved either planning their turn or helping with managing the cards or the zombies. The game is over in 15 minutes and usually everybody asks for just "one more game", which is the sign of a successful game. Only drawbacks I can find is the setup time is between 5-10 minutes (almost as long as a scenario!) and the game takes a lot of table space as the maps are huge (which is a plus).

Real time cooperative zombie survival game.
Kill zombies as you make your way through the streets of the city in order to complete the scenario objective. Search for weapons and items along the way.
While it tests cooperation, organization and quick-thinking, it doesn't require a great deal of interesting decision-making.

Playing the game could need an extra player to follow the search cards and the zombies killed/added.

Excellent components quality and finition.

The game play is a lot of fun, with frantic action management and lots of tension.

The set-up, however, has absolutely killed this game for me. A fifteen minute game is great, but not when it takes 10 minutes to set up.

Most fun I have had playing a game in a long time.  Here is my prediction:  This will sell out fast.  If you like tense, fast pass games then you should consider purchasing this game.  The first scenario only teaches the rules and is not much fun but after that it is the ride of your life.  The only reason why this is not a 10 for me is because I just could not play this all the time.  After 4 straight plays of this game my heart was pounding and I was way over stressed.  But I have had a nights rest and I want to play it again right now.

A pretty simple zombie figurine co-op - but it's timed, with a thematic soundtrack. No time for endless optimization of co-operation and moves here! It creates a true feel of zombie panic and is actually very entertaining - in my book, this is the best zombie game so far.

While part of me feels like I'm being harsh with a 4, the main thing I have to say on this game is "May as well just play Dead of Winter".

I guess it's more family friendly, but I feel like that locks in with the Hunger Games phenomena... "Battle Royale for kids" is an Oxymoron. Either you think the children you are paying with can handle violence and death or you probably should get off subjects like Zombies and murder games entirely.

The game plays fast (well, 15 minutes, right?), but actual setup and tear down  takes awhile, meaning it's not "faster" than many games of its kinds meaningfully, you just spend less time playing because that portion of the experience is rushed. I like the idea of like a campaign of scenarios, but there really isn't enough variety in thr play experience... The mechanics are too simple, and honestly it feels like a lot of aspects are dedicated to screwing you rather than helping you... For instance every character has an advantage, but also a really horrid and crippling disadvantage that's far worse than the aid their perk gives you... So we ended up choosing based on who hobbled us less rather than whose special ability was most helpful or fun... I have to be honest, unless you're shooting for so,etching really oppressive like a Lovecraftian theme, that just feels like bad game design to me.

Ultimately, the game isn't awful, there are just better games for similar prices that offer similar experiences done better. While more complex and expensive, I for instance turned to sell this immediately because, like... I have Gloomhaven. If I want an adventure sim, Imma play that instead, you know?

Really needs to be played 2 or 4, kinda weird with 3.  With 4 players you all know your roles pretty well and that's the best way to play it.  The game looks great and I enjoy the system.  It's a pretty hard game and takes a while to setup, but it is a good time.
My recommendation is play with 2 or 4 and have several hours to play it.  It's a quick game, but it's best when played several scenarios in a row with the same characters.  Playing just 1 game you get the feel for the game by the time it ends.
I really want to get an afternoon to play a bunch of games in a row and I think it'll really shine.

---------------

Amazing game: fast, tense, stressful, thematic. You really feel zombie apocalypse: undead chase you, they horde on you, weapons break when you need them most. Production quality is so-so (zombie miniatures - I'm looking at you), but then again you don't really have time to appreciate or dislike them;). The only negative is the set-up time (30-40 mins in our case), but it is still the best real-time board game for me.

Super frantic game, balanced by the in fact very simple gameplay. Probably one of my favorite cooperative game to date.

Fun and quick. Good components. Love that every weapon is unique other than starting gear. Scenarios are nice. The lady zombies cause issues with placing zombies on the board. One zombie size would have been better. Not too much variety with player powers. Nice theme, though. Ultimately a fun game that doesn't see the table, because people aren't into stressful, quick games.

Real time coop survival in the inner city ravaged by the zombie apocalypse. 15 minute modular board missions to get to the other side of town, search and rescue, escort, or hold your ground. Move, fight, search. Work as a team.  Limit noise as much as possible (easier said than done). Withstand zombie surges and hoardes. I like how different weapons change your defense rating for withstanding zombie attacks. Of course, your teamwork turns into pure chaos as soon as the first groan of zombies in the soundtrack. Have fun.

I generally really like games with timed mechanics, but 15 minutes is just too long I think. The game doesn't have as many tense moments as other similar games do so it's hard for me to justify pulling this out over another.

The artwork is very nice though and is one of the main reasons it got to the table as much as it did while I owned it.

This game is a lot of fun ... until it is time to reset the board for the next scenario.  You have at most 15 minutes of playtime, and then you get to rebuild the map, which isn't a quick process.  It REALLY kills the flow of this otherwise fast-paced, intense game.

I did a solo "dry run" just to familiarize myself with the mechanics and also to see how quickly I could set up the game. Well, I didn't play with the soundtrack, I played 3 characters and drew a zombie card at the end of 2 turns. That's how I modded play to compensate for no soundtrack. The result? 10-15 minute setup (my first time ever) and about 30 minutes to play through and I still barely made it.

Rahdo says 5 minute setup with a couple of experienced players and I would agree. one person can setup cards while another 1+ player(s) can setup the map.

It's fun. I like it. And I don't have to worry about automatically hitting my buddy first, if (s)he happens to be in the same zone as me.

Played the first three scenarios with 4 players and it was pretty fun. We won the third scenario within six minutes, but the horde cup was overflowing and if there would have been one or two more growls there would have been a pretty nasty fight. Then we realized that the player who played Vance used guns, so we probably would have taken a bit longer than we did. 
So far the game is very interesting and I enjoyed the first few games, but I can't wait to play the harder scenarios.

Downside: Set up time is a bit long especially because the game itself last only 15 minutes. If you don't win a scenario the first time and you need a few tries I think it's okay.

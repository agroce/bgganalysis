Muy bueno, teniendo en cuenta lo que cuesta: 0. Hay un azar inmenso porque todo se basa en tiradas de dados pero el sistema de juego está implementado de tal manera que siempre resulta más o menos controlable (al menos en similar grado que otros juegos 'profesionales') y además, hay que ir tomando decisiones.

:arrowE: [u]Synopsis[/u]:
You are an eccentric Artificier, Isodoros, mostly maligned as an obsolete wackjob by the Artificier's Guild. The world will end within weeks. The Godshand device is waning in power, and cannot fend off the delayed apocalypse any longer. You are determined to recover the fabled components of the ancient Utopia Engine, successfully connect and activate it, and banish the impending destruction of the planet. Your peers think you're insane. You know it's either do or die. Grab two dice and a pencil and embark on a grueling, narrative, number-crunching solitaire adventure against the destruction of the known world.

:arrowE: [u]What I like most[/u]:
This is the most game in the fewest components I've ever played. You attempt to locate a component of the Utopia Engine by selecting an adventure location and rolling 2d6 three times--assigning each number to a grid of six options. Your goal is to create numbers which, when subtracted, are as close to "0" as possible. You also roll crafting checks for assembling the components, fighting monsters in encounters, and trying not to get yourself killed. The story is so good and the mechanics, while seemingly so simple, are deep and nuanced.

:arrowE: [u]What I like least[/u]:
As a dice game, there are many factors regarding chance which can end up snowballing your lack of successes into unwinnable states. This can be crushing. Frankly, I enjoy the difficulty. There is more mitigation (especially in terms of items and events) available than meets the eye.

For a free game that requires minimal effort to put together, this game is truly amazing solo experience.  The randomness of the dice rolls mixes nicely with the puzzle of how you will use the numbers. There's also a fun 'push your luck' element that had me cheering out loud at moments. 

This is exactly the type of experience I'm looking for when I'm stuck home alone on a rainy day.

A nice clever solo game with straight forward rules. No errata, no ambiguities. With just two paper sheets of fine artwork, two dice, a pencil and an eraser you get a fast pace and challenging play. There is a lot of luck involved but with the right resolutions one can overcome partly this handicap. When in need there are rules helping the player to overcome challenges. Lady Luck has the final say in the duration and result of every game play. Nevertheless it is fun and interesting and you will always go for one more try. Good work!

This is a really clever but TOUGH solo dice game.  All you need is 2 printed sheets (or even just 1 compact sheet), 2 dice, and a pencil with eraser and you've got everything you need for 20-30 minutes of fun.  This is like a game I would have made up in study hall if I was a talented game designer.  Grab a few more dice and some d6 Shooters printouts and you're all set for a plane or train ride.

The one suggestion I have is that it would be nice if there were a few more gameplay hints on the sheets, such as roll consequences for constructs and links.

Homebrew on nice laminated cardboard that I use dry-erase markers to play on.  

Just finished my first game of this, I watched the instructional video here at BGG and I was up and running in less then 2 minutes afterwards! 

Very successful first game, I activated the Utopia Engine on the last turn available to me. Near the end I was knocked unconcious by a rampant Fiesty Gremlin at Glassrock Canyon, which was a blessing in disguise as it reset my HP (I had minimize the time I was unconcious with the use of the Void Gate construct. I was able to active 3 skulls with excess energy so I delayed Armageddon for 3 extra handy turns. Just enough to gain my final construct and have it activate with a perfect zero with the help of the Scrying Lens Construct I had previously activated.

Then it was a matter of linking up all the constructs, I got very lucky with the die, rolling many doubles! I was able to get a final activation difficulty of 9, with still 4 spaces in the waste basket. I decided to spend 3 HP to bring the activation difficulty down to 6. My first roll was Snake Eyes!!! I won my first game with 221 points. Probably the highest score I will ever get with the game! You know how it is.

Great game, clever die placement mechanics. I really enjoyed. Highly recommended solitaire. Feels sort of like a thematic game of Yahtzee and more fun!

A fun little pencil and paper dice game.  Replayability is limited, but the component creation commitment is extremely small as well.  You are trying to use the Utopia Engine to save the planet, and you have to get various objects from various locations to do so.  After you figure out the ideal way to use your limited items, and the best way to put together the machine, there is little else to engage in.

Great solo PnP puzzle/game for us cerebral gamers.  Utopia Engine looks great on paper, excellent art.  The rulebook could be streamlined a bit but I'm sure this will evolve as it exists.  I'm looking forward to giving it more attempts.  1st try resulted me in being killed on day 8 after retrieving 3 artifacts (Seal of Balance, Void Gate and Hermetic Mirror).  Death was by a double-hit from a Vengeful Shade when having only 1 hp left.

An extremely entertaining solo/dice/puzzle(ish) sort of game.  The artwork is beautifully done, which serves to draw the player even deeper into the very atmospheric story.

There's a large amount of randomness though it avoids feeling unfair by placing a multitude of decisions firmly in the players hands.  Achieving a full victory is quite difficult, but the point system keeps you from feeling like losses are wastes of time.  And even though, after 6 play-throughs, I have yet to beat it, the game's primary mechanic is compelling enough to keep me coming back for more punishment again and again!

Highly recommended!

It takes a couple of games before you get familiar with all the different bonuses you can get, depending on what you do.

First edition: This solo dice game isn't terribly complicated, although there are some conditional modifiers and special options to keep track of, and it doesn't help that the rules ought to be completely restructured. Basically there are three variations on a "roll, assign and subtract" mechanism and everything can be summed up as "roll well". The theme didn't really take off for me, so I doubt I'll be back soon.

Second edition: The rulebook has indeed been much improved. There have also been some improvements in rules details and there's a javascript version to handle the bookkeeping. One point added to the rating to reflect this, but one point also subtracted for the lack of a thematic justification why Isodoros shambles around the wilderness on his own. (Finally won the game with a score of 210 - it would have taken a [i]long[/i] time using pencil and dice!)

For a light, simple, one player game, this game is amazing. Strategy may seem to be light, but it exists with in the complexities of the number arrangement. I was quite thrilled in my first play of it. The components also look fantastic and rulebook is pretty clear. Lots of little stuff to remember, but it works well. Only thing I would like to see changed or added to would be items. Maybe if players could find some other rare, magical items hidden away to add to their belt. It would add a little variety to it and keep the game fresh. There could be a short list of item in the back of the book one could find during a search. Last but not least, the unique story attached to this game worked well, and you could really feel as if a doomsday was coming. As each day passed and one had yet to finish finding the different artifacts or getting them activated, the tension really rose.

This is a neat little print and play game about exploring a wilderness for parts to a mythical machine, then assembling it to prevent the end of the world. There are a number of worthy mechanics in a little package, the way you search an area, the way you assemble, even down to the way the two pages of the game are perpendicular to each other, allowing you to refer to the lower sheet when needed. Well worth a look. How much replay? Well, I played it a few times and haven't tried it since. Once you succeed at it, there is a reduction in the feeling of accomplishment, though there are ways of increasing the difficulty. Personally I don't feel any great need to revisit it any time soon, but I am only an occasional solo gamer.

Funny, puzzly solo adventure with a lot of dice rolling. Some tactic involved in deciding how to use dice values. Played this in the spreadsheet version, which lacks the illustrations.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Hard to beat this one for simple-yet-intriguing solo play. Printable board, common game components (2d6), alchemy, magic artifacts, unique ways of interpreting the effects of die results, great fusion of luck and strategy... it's got everything a fresh, light, casual RPG needs. The engine has massive opportunities for expansion, does well with co-op, and requires (bare minimum) a few sheets of paper and two dice. Talk about getting the most out of the least! 

High replayability, great solo game for when you don't want to bust out a deck of cards or a whole box of something. There's a lot to be learned from this game and its engine.

Has some decisions in it but not a huge amount. The die mechanic of having to choose where to put the numbers in is interesting. I think it takes just a little too long for my liking because it felt samey by the end

RATING: 8
The most clever solo dice game I have encountered, because it goes beyond allocation and adds another layer of manipulation that not only informs how you allocate, but give you the ability to help create the result rather than just dealing with what the dice present.  Tons of fun and not the slog that some solo games can be.

It's a good game, for a free solo PnP. I didn't expect to win the first time around from what I heard about it, but somehow managed to activate the Engine. Turns out that role-playing the scenarios to myself makes it much more fun. Felt like a little kid again.

Well, played a round.  Took a bit too long, but it was ok fun, but nothing too special.  Nice artwork, though, and again, some decent ideas.  I like the little examples in the rules which helped bring out the theme.  But, it got a bit samey and I was happy when the game wrapped up.  I came close with 88 points before losing.  Probably won't play again, but glad to have tried and thanks to the author for making it available.

[u]21-May-2013[/u]:  Yet another one of my PnP discoveries of recent weeks.  All you need are two player pages, two dice, and a pencil, and you're ready to go.  I can't believe how much story I've gotten out of my two plays so far.  I even wrote up a long session report for my first play.  Go seek it out to see what this game can provide with some imagination and so little in terms of components.

You play the role of Isodoros as he must search the lands for six ancient pieces of a great machine that will stop the impending end of the world.  You must travel to several locations, gather these items, then assemble them in your workshop, and hope you can get it running before Doomsday arrives.

The dice mechanism in this one is excellent, in my opinion.  The die rolls are random, and yet you have options in how to use them.  Plus each step along the way has you use the same dice mechanism in slightly different ways, so you get a different feel throughout the game.  And I think you can build a very fun narrative out of you adventure as you try to save the world.

Go try this game.  Seriously.

I own a PnP version.

The idea is perfect....the artwork is great also and the game could have been a blast. A great game with a great idea.

Luck....way too much luck....and i can accept luck but in this game there are no modifiers or re-rolls (except a few and rare occasions). There should have been a mechanism to help a player with so many rolls...it takes some of the luck and turns it to a little more strategy.
There is no way to stop a bad luck and you can be killed just as easily.

Way to difficult to achieve a victory and even if i managed to do so it would be solely to luck and not to my strategy or decision that i made during the game.


Sad because this game has "something" to give and it fails miserably.

Utopia Engine adds the fun of dice-chucking to a nice little arithmetic puzzler.

Very easy to build. Print some pages, add 2 dice and a pencil and eraser.
And very portable. I keep this game in a folder in my backpack and basically carry it with me everywhere.
Minimal footprint during play as well. If you are looking for a travel game to play solo, this game is a must-have. (Well, unless you dislike throwing dice and adding and subtracting numbers :))

On the downside, the rulebook, while fairly clear and thorough, is quite long. It takes a while to read through and the organization could be improved. I did a few plays (quite badly misplayed) and then went over the forum posts before fully grasping the game rules.
The game may also feel a little too long and repetitive.
Finally, I suspect repeated plays will soon 'solve' the game. As in, the optimal moves will become obvious, robbing the game of interesting decisions.

But even after exhausting the interest of figuring out the puzzle, I think the game would still make for an engaging arithmetic exercise with a side of push-your-luck fun.

Kudos and thanks to creator Nick Hayes for this great solo game!

I discovered this game a few years back and recently reprinted it for my 11 year old son.  We sometimes print out 2 copies and play at the same time to see who can get closer to victory.  That said, victory does NOT come easily. 
Amazing that this was a free game (Thanks, Nick Hayes!) as I've paid WAY more for far less in this hobby.  
I'm always on the lookout for good solo games and this one is great.

A wonderfully presented back story, and a ton of rules to go through for a game that otherwise only requires 2 dice, 1 piece of paper, pencil and eraser. But all those rules means there's options and different ways to approach the problem. Essentially you need to do a series of dice searches, which require some extreme rolls to pull off successfully (6 rolls, generate 2 three digit numbers with the 6 results, success defined as the difference being 10 or less between the two numbers - ie a lot of luck required), with a mini-reward for getting close, or a combat resolution if you fail, which will likely generate some hit points for you which will eventually kill your game if you get too many. Anyway, you need to successfully complete 6 of these searches, amidst all the failures, and this can take a bit of time and eventually become wearisome and repetitive, especially as the dice generally go against you rather than for you. After that, there's another die-rolling process variation to go through to "activate" the artifacts you found in the searches, requiring you essentially to roll 1's and 6's within 8 rolls, repeat if you don't do it - and do that 6 times. And then there's another die rolling process to link them all. Then another to win the game based on how well you did in the last bit. As you can see, Xtreme Dice Rolling beckons. The story drags you in and along, giving you nice context for what you're doing, but I doubt I'll want to play much (at 30 minutes or so for a game). After a while it becomes rote mechanical, playing the odds over and over, with not enough technology tree (or intra-game change) to maintain interest enough to warrant the time investment. You're just too much in the lap of the gods ...

Light diversion of a P&P game that requires no craft skills, just a decent eraser (or a source of cheap printer ink). I like the core mechanism dice/numbers/boxes. Games include plenty of tense die rolls. The theme doesn't do it for me, though.

A great solo game. Feels very thematic despite the little information given.

An interesting dice mechanic is used to explore and find pieces needed to build the Utopia Engine. The collecting and filling out of all the different pieces is very satisfying.

You can collect special items, but that sometimes feels pointless. The risk of death is very high, so it seems like it's not always worth the time and health required to get them.

Overall a great game.

Pretty cool for a solo dice game.  Extremely simple to Print and Play (no cutting, just printing).  Nice line art with a good theme and game mechanics.

A delightful solo game that is quite portable.  There are both strategic and tactical choices, a neat theme, and lots of tension.

I was a bit dismayed to find an optimal strategy exploiting an overpowered item, but other than that it is an interesting game full of tough short- and long-term trade-offs.

Not only is "Utopia Engine" a solo game, but it is also a FREE print and play game! On top of that, it is literally PRINT and PLAY. All that's needed are the two main game sheets, the rules, 2d6 dice, and a pencil with an eraser. That's it! Don't let the simplicity of the components fool you though. This is definitely a challenging game that can become quite addictive. If you like rolling dice, there's really no reason NOT to try this game. I suspect that it'll be a hit. Good luck! You'll need it...

Fun little gem of a dice game. Its a fun experience full of tense dice rolls and some interesting decisions, and I enjoy playing it when I'm at work or in other situations where I am unable to play a bigger, more in-depth game, but cant see myself playing it at home during my free time.

I would give Utopia Engine a 7 on my own rating scale, but it gets a 6 on BGG's rating scale due to my preference for only playing it at work and other non-ideal gaming situations.

It is quite excellent for what it is: a free, PnP dice game that has virtually no footprint or setup required. Definitely worth checking out.

This seems like a clever idea, but it gets a little repetitious, and it seems like there's a very standard way that players should enter numbers when searching to go for the best result.  That makes it a little too dependent on the roll of the dice, which can be a little frustrating.  It's not a bad way to spend some time, and I give the designer props for making a true "print and play" game, but I think I'd still choose a computer game to play whenever I have time to kill when I'm by myself.

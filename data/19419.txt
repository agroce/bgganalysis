Surprisingly quick-playing version of the original.  You could pretty much say the "Kartenspiel" version of T&E, were it not for the chunky discs.  Still, small box and 80% of the fun of the original in about half the playing time.  A winner!

Got this at Kublacon 2007 auction.   Mainly because I owned the regular version and wanted to see how this one plays out.  Played at Conquest 2007, a more portable version of T&E.  Plays rather well since you no longer have to worry about playboard geography.  Failed miserably with all my external and internal conflicts.

{2P: ???, 3P: 8, 4P: ???}

It was bound to happen: after so many [thing=533]card[/thing] [thing=8217]game[/thing] [thing=12589]ports[/thing] of [thing=437]successful[/thing], [thing=3076]larger[/thing] [thing=12]games[/thing], it was only a matter of time before [i][thing=42]Tigris & Euphrates[/thing][/i] was given the same treatment.  To a seemingly vast number of BGG users, modifying such a classic title is pure heresy.  However, I must admit that I was intrigued by the idea.  I have found card game versions to be satisfying, and in at least [thing=27364]one case[/thing] more enjoyable than its [thing=18602]progenitor[/thing].  My expectations of such an adaptation are a streamlined set of rules, which provide a gaming experience that is reminiscent of the progenitor title, while offering increased portability.  As my collection swells, I value packaging efficiency more and more dearly.  As I type this, I think that "most bang for your [storage space] buck" would make for an interesting GeekList.

[i]Euphrates & Tigris Card Game (ETCG)[/i] definitely provides a nostalgic experience.  With an initial card setup that reminds me of the stones in [i][thing=372]Schotten-Totten[/thing][/i], [person=2]Knizia[/person] manages to capture the same sense of turn angst that is present in the original game.  The unease felt as spaces between kingdoms dwindled with each tile is successfully mirrored as the number of cards in each column grows.  The old familiar faces of internal and external conflicts are back.  And while it may seem redundant to say that card games use a lot of cards, by no means do they need to be exclusively comprised of them.  The wooden leader disks are also here.  Simply put, there is no mistaking this game's heritage.

The rules are definitely streamlined.  Instead of two catastrophe tiles, each player has only one such card.  The six monuments comprised of all of the color pairings have been replaced by three ships, each of which has blue as a common color.  I would hazard a guess that it is due to the lack of a board with pre-printed river spaces.  The player screens are also gone, which only makes sense as cards provide a natural way to conceal their values.

For all of the similarities, there are a couple of items that I wish were different.  The first has to do with tracking your score.  In [i][thing=42]Tigris & Euphrates[/thing][/i], players keep their scoring cubes behind their screens.  This mechanic creates hidden but trackable information.  The pros and cons of this type of data has been thoroughly discussed in [thread=110984]a favorite thread of mine[/thread].  In [i]ETCG[/i], players' points form a face-up stack of cards.  Players are not allowed to look through these stacks, not even their own.  A stated variation allows players to create four stacks (one per color), so that the "number of points are visible to everyone."  I dislike both approaches.  I assume that they prevent players from cheating, since cards represent both tiles and victory points.  I would prefer to trust my gaming friends, and adopt a house rule allowing players to look at their own, face-down scoring stacks.

The other objection I have with the game is more of a nit pick.  In the original game, a player whose Trader is present when two kingdoms are connected may have a choice between two treasures.  This player must choose one of the four corner treasures first, if it is an option.  This small, seemingly insignificant rule is very effective at focusing the game's development towards the center of the board.  However, there is no such provision in [i]ETCG[/i].  It is easy for a player to "hide" a treasure on the edges of the layout.  I am going to try another house rule which requires treasures to be taken from the outside edges first, when there is a choice.

The changes in [i]ETCG[/i] aren't all bad.  The one area where I think this game truly shines is in the earning of victory points.  When a player can score a point, she places a card of the appropriate color from her hand onto her stack of scoring cards.  If she cannot play such a card or [i]chooses not to[/i], then she does not score the point!  Now I have to pause to consider whether I want to use all of my red Temple cards for an internal conflict, or if I want to save one so that I can swap out a Treasure card on my next action (after an external conflict).  If my Trader is connected to the blue/green Ship card, then I may not use all of my green Market cards in an external conflict so that I can score a point at the end of my turn.  This simple, clean mechanic works wonders, and gives [i]ETCG[/i] its own, unique personality.

During game play, [i]ETCG[/i] does take up a fair amount of room on the table.  I don't mind.  I'm more concerned about the amount of storage space required in my cabinets, or in my suitcase.  It is smaller than the original [i][thing=42]Tigris & Euphrates[/thing][/i] (I have the Mayfair version), but that's not saying much; there is still a lot of "box bloat," here.  I can envision a different insert which would allow the cards to be stacked on their sides, in a single row, as opposed to the two "drop holes" which are provided.  Two more channels with rounded bottoms could be used to store eight leader disks, each.  Such a configuration would likely reduce the overall volume of the box by at least sixty percent.  If I were better at crafts, then I could try to create a prototype myself to take on the road.

[i]Euphrates & Tigris Card Game[/i] provides a gaming experience that is familiar, and that shows its lineage.  For the most part, the rules are as elegant as is expected given the source material.  The pivotal mechanic of using cards from your hands as victory points, and deciding when to score them is a refreshing tactical consideration.  It may not be everthing that is [i][thing=42]Tigris & Euphrates[/thing][/i], but then again it's not meant to be.  If I'm at home, then I'll break out the larger game.  If I'm assembling a few games to take on vacation, then a more compact version of [i]ETCG[/i] can still scratch that strategy gaming itch in a lot less space.

A portable version of T&E that represents it's parent well. If you already know T&E, this game is fairly easy to pick up once you understand how the cards and points are played. I would not like to teach this to someone who hasn't played T&E as the visuals of the boardgame help you understand what you are trying to do. The card game is a little abstracted. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
This game is E&T, the board game, changed into a card game, and it is also the order in which I came across them on my game journey. I rate the board game so highly (9) that initially I was reluctant to give the card game a shot, fearing a scenic slide from along the admiration scale from the lofty perfection heights of Go to the bearable pleasantness of Reversi, or worse, even further down towards the infuriating pointlessness of Noughts and Crosses. Experience has taught that few games that are dreamt up to cash in on a classic's fame stand sturdy on their own feet, with notable exceptions.

Yet, it is striking how few dynamics and mechanisms have been lost in translation, given that the cards have taken over all the functions of the original board pieces, with only the wooden leader discs surviving the re-imagination. Cards now are the board, tiles, victory point cubes, and temple buildings, all in one.
 
Actually, calling it a card game is a bit of a misnomer. If printing 32 chess pieces on cards, and then add 32 white cards and 32 black cards would be enough to transform Chess into a card game, then it is. But I strongly feel that no matter how technically correct the description is, if the first thing you do is to build a board, it isn't a card game in my book. And setting the board is indeed the first thing you do, by placing a row of starting cards on the table. A washing line with 8 pegs from which the expanding kingdoms will be dangled.

In E&T the Card Game, the cards are also used to recreate some of the spatial dynamics that are the backbone of the board version, but the 2 river grid is now stripped down to 8 abstract columns with left and right neighbours only, that are 1 (card) tile away, and that can be joined at the top by placing a card between two columns. It was disappointing how restricted the joining up was, since one of the things I like best in the board game is how it all hinges on how you approach rival kingdoms, and how you trigger conflicts between neighbouring kingdoms, trying to split seemingly settled terrain into whole new areas by deciding in which order conflicts between leaders are resolved. But whilst losing that strategic intricateness was a bitter pill, it was nice to see whole new dilemma pop up. Having to use 8 cards as terrain tiles, conflict resolvers and victory points... well, that certainly demands hand [i]management[/i].

Without that, this would have bitterly disappointed me. It all works really well and that should be enough, but somehow it just doesn't convince me. Maybe you would be thrilled if you found your Mini had received a Formula 1 engine transplant over the weekend. But you'd be less chuffed if your F1 car showed up in a Mini body. I have the board game sitting on my shelf, I can think of very few reasons to bring this one out instead, and that is because it doesn't really add or alter anything substantial, maybe portability at a stretch.

Contrast that with Settlers the Card Game, that turns that multiplayer classic into a solid 2 player slug fest. It injects something that the board game lacks, and both games will find their way to the table under different circumstances. Here, to me, the card version reacts as badly to a drop in player numbers, and the table space required hardly makes this an alternative to the board version for smaller cafe and pub tables. The harder hand management is cute, but it isn't enough to stop me from pulling the board version from the shelves. Maybe I have grown to admire that simply a bit too much, but this one really fell flat against far better memories.

This, in turn, did make me wonder how I would take to the card game if I hadn't known the board version, a question I will never be able to answer without speculating. I do think it lacks some narrative clarity and atmosphere that the board game does have, and having explained both games to people, for some reason the board game is understood more easily, and better liked. Judging by how people talk about what goes on during play, language used for the card game is far more abstract, and it does seem to be linked to how deeply engaged people are with the game, and to some degree, here, their level of enjoyment.

On the whole, I can't quite see the point of this one, but only because I have the board alternative at hand. Without that around, I would probably happily play this, but would be a lot less smitten with what was on offer. Either way, it certainly is a decent game, just not novel, nor outstanding.

If the whiff of 'luck of the tile draw' in the original board game got up your nose, stay well clear from this one, as it is more noticeable here. If just 8 cards take over all functions including victory points than a lucky draw can outweigh a solid board position. No matter how good your play, if you get stuck without a discardable surplus you won't have much to add up at the end.

This looks like Knizia revisiting an old design with the maturation of his design prowess.  Certain things I enjoy compared to its older counterpart: larger hand size, faster refresh rates and more dynamic conflicts.  Most importantly it is shorter and slightly less complex, but at what cost?  As Chris Farrell put it, there is a certain phantom pain for the elements missing from the original.  And in the end, it just isn't different enough to warrant owning, let alone publication.  Knizia has avoided releasing ubiquitous rehashes like some of his peers and it is disappointing to see him do so now, particularly with his current hot streak.

I kicked this up to an 8 after playing a number of games with 4 players. For some reason, the 4-player version seems much more satisfactory to me then the 3-player; the pacing is better, the level of competition is better, the flow of the game seems more natural. Some will probably like 3 players better, though. Regardless, this is not on the level of other similar-weight games like San Juan, Tower of Babel, or Palazzo, but still quite good I think.
---
So, I've played this a bunch now (about 5 times). I like it. I consider it $15 well-spent. But I'm not dying to play it again. Part of the problem I think is that unlike the usual card game port (Puerto Rico -> San Juan, say), it's *so* similar to the boardgame that even I get phantom pains from the stuff that's missing. Part of it is also that I have a nagging suspicion something isn't quite right here. I can't quite identify it, and that bugs me further. But something feels vaguely off with the rhythm of the game, or maybe the density of the cards.

Regardless, I do enjoy the game and I do still think it's good, especially given the lower price. But if you already own T&E and are perectly happy with it, this doesn't bring a lot to the table. But if you are not a major T&E fan, or find you would like something shorter, check it out; it does manage to capture a chunk of the good stuff in a smaller package.

It's like a short-hand for the full board game.  So, in some sense, it's an improvement -- you get more quickly to the meat of it.  However, it's also somehow less satisfying -- the one-dimensional nature of the "territories" seems to railroad the strategies somewhat.

One two player game was enough to leave us wanting more.  Playing T & E gave us a bit of a leg up on the rules.  There were some differences that we didn't appreciate until too late.  It was interesting to watch the grid reformat with external conflict resolution.

RATING: 4
A surprisingly close representation of the board game as a card game. I guess I don't see the reason to play the card game, though, since it takes the same space as the board game to play, and takes about the same amount of time to play. But the real critical problem, relative to the board game, is that the internal conflicts have been trivialized with a maximum temple defensive bonus of 1. If this card game came out in the absence of the board game, it would be great. But as it is, I think I'd always prefer to play the real version.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
With me liking the full boardgame to a very considerable degree, buying the cardgame was a no-brainer. After a brief session at Spiel 2005, I waited until the Dutch edition came out and bought it immediately. At first I was very enthusiastic, but quite rapidly my interest began to wane. The cardgame is a fairly accurate translation of the boardgame with a few minor changes; enthusiasts of the original will find themselves quickly at home. But what killed the fun was the contrived scoring mechanic (you only score when discarding a card in the same colour, and you cannot see what you scored) combined with the fact that you cannot exchange with the deck if you have a lousy hand. These issues are not present in the original, and result in a rather dull and somewhat grating play experience. The second issue I have with the game is that strategically it is not as challenging as the original. Attacks can only come from placing cards between columns, leading to a very static display. In the original you can attack from all directions, leading to a much more fluid and interesting game. 

It would be fairly easy to port over all the good stuff from the original to improve on this title, but why bother? You'd just be recreating the original which you probably already have. Now in all honesty, it isn't fair to compare a game to another and then come the conclusion that it is lacking. But because of the striking similarity I feel the comparison is warranted. Simply put: every time I play the cardgame I wonder why I didn't pull out the boardgame instead. (It sees little enough tabletime as it is already.) I can see next to nothing which this title has over the original, not even in portability: print the board on a cloth, and you're done.

A clear miss from Herr Doktor Knizia, who probably wanted to jump onto the train of converting classics to simpler card versions—but as this title shows, it takes more for this to be a success. (He seriously botched things with Ra and Razzia, too.) It took some doing, but the game eventually left my collection.

Eh.  This was, to me, an OK game.  The problem that that original has with players being restricted by their card/tile draw is exacerbated here, since there is no option to throw in your hand for more cards.  They play a lot alike otherwise, but I'd prefer to play the original.  But I've only played it once, and I should really try it again--my rating could certainly change on this.

Neat game of decisive card placement. Lacks the depth and strategy of the original T&E board game, but if you've never played its fantastic predecessor, it's a good game in its own right - better yet, just play T&E and your life will be much better.

Only reason to play this would be to get the feel of T&E with only 2 players, as original T&E does not play well with only 2 IMHO.  I don't like the fact that you need to play a card from hand to score for a card just played, and I don't agree with the "hidden from yourself" scoring.  I can't imagine wanting to play this with 3 or 4.  I would just play the board game.  But not too bad for 2.

I have now played a few (2 player) games, and my opinion has changed for the better.  While I certainly don't know how to play *well*, I now at least have a handle on the game.  Instead of focusing on the conflicts as I did in the first game, I viewed the game in terms of a victory point generation engine, and that made a lot more sense.

Eventually, I gave E&T away.  It never seemed to rise to the top of the "hey, let's play *this*" list.

RATING: 6
A very good translation of the main game to a card game. The rules and play are almost identical.
But it scores low because the differences count. Needing a second card to score a colour aggravates the minor luck factor of drawing the colours you need. Kingdoms are now one dimensional lines which takes away the majority of the positional strategy. You're left with something that appears to be T&E, but isn't nearly as good.

Players try to score points in four spheres of influence, by constructing ancient kingdoms.  Nine years after the boardgame, the card game version appears.  If you have played the boardgame, 90% of the card game will be very familiar.  Kingdoms are now eight seperate columns of cards, seeded with a treasure/temple card.  Points are earned by playing a card into a kingdom, then dropping a matching pair from your hand into your victory point pile.  Internal and external combat is the same (external is triggered via a column being connected at the treasure/temple card).  Monuments become trading ports, etc.  In reality, a more portable version of the boardgame that is also a lot quicker to complete.  With such a pedigree, it still ranks high.

Good game, but not quite as absorbing as the original.  Good substitute for when you don't have much room in your game bag (though it takes up just as much table space, if not more).

The level of randomness in the cards you have in your hand, since you tend to use a lot of them in any serious conflict, makes it impossible to make medium-term plans. For a highly tactical game of this nature, that is deadly.

The card game removes any of the board positioning, which I expected of course. This aspect is not actually THAT big of a deal for me, and it's somewhat interesting spatially, but just not as great as the original. Again, expected. But, when you play a disaster it doesn't stay on the board, so it buys you almost nothing.

But, this game has a couple of serious flaws in it. First of all, you can't discard your cards for an action like you can with the tiles in the board game. That takes one of the perceived weaknesses of the original and exacerbates it tremendously. Couple that with the fact that you need to also discard an additional card of the color you are scoring when you lay a card matching your leader, and it becomes too chancy to maintain a good hand. I can't overstate how bad I think this is. You lay a card, and to score it you need the matching leader there and yet another card in your hand to play from your hand into your score pile. Great. If you could take an action to discard your hand and redraw this might help. We discussed trying it this way, but decided against it.

It also seems easy to get in a situation where you can't get a leader onto the "board". Instead of placing them in empty areas, you have to place them on the card directly. Not sure how this could be changed.

Finally, the way you keep score is annoying. The base rules say to stack them in a pile face-up but not even the owning player can look at them. Dumbest thing ever. There is a variant where they are all visible to everyone. Fine, but what about just a face-down pile that only you can look at?

Similar to other games I have played, but this one felt like a mess to look at and play. If there were not smoother games out there I guess it would be OK, but I'll pass on this one.

The rules for someone reason were not intuitive for me and took longer then need be to understand the game.

I didn't enjoy this at all. It seemed a pointless exercise to convert a good board game into a bad card game. Maybe there are some strategies inside here, but I can't be bothered looking for them. I won't dismiss it entirely, it's not broken, just there's a lot of effort for little result. Not on my shopping list. Sorry Paul!

RATING: 8
It's great that a portable version of Tigris & Euphrates came out!  The theme and mechanics of the game come across quite well, but frankly it's a little more fun with an actual board laid out for your kingdoms to cover.  As it is, players unfamiliar with the original board game may feel overwhelmed by the game length and the complexity of rules governing a rather simple-looking grid of cards.

A relatively fun approximation of the original, but doesn't quite live up to it.  I think the mechanism through which external conflicts and catastrophes are resolved are not as satisfying as the original because of the cards shifting.  Perhaps my expectations were off.  Also a real pain to teach, at least in my first attempt.

Feels really abstract and odd.  Glad it was free at Origins.  Play the board game version of this great game.  The highlight of T&E is seeing the kingdoms expand and contract, this is lost in the card version.

While the boardgame is more epic in feel, the card game is just as tense. It adds a small twist or two, but still retains the general feel of the boardgame. The best thing about it is that it plays in 30-45 minutes.

Este mesmo jogo "de tabuleiro" é fantástico no entanto difícil de ensinar e jogar. Iniciar com este, de cartas, e depois o de tabuleiro facilita bastante o entendimento das regras e de algumas situações caóticas de jogo. Se você gosta do E&T mas sente dificuldade para explicar esse é um ótimo caminho. Permite dois a quatro jogadores, rápido e relativamente fácil de explicar. Recomendo.

This is a card game version of Knizia's very intense land conquering game.  The game does a good job of capturing the feel and strategy of the board game, but it's more focused, quicker, and less intense.  My friends tell me I'm crazy, but I actually prefer lighter version of the game since it's easier and quicker to play, and better for 2 players.

RATING: 7
I should point out that I am not a fan of the boardgame that this game is based upon.  This card game version has a lot in common, but it's easier to see how different kingdoms, and how different cards, relate to each other.  Spatially it's just easier to read what is going on, but at the same time you are still stuck with plenty of interesting decisions.  I also like that you have to remember what you've collected and try and shoot for whatever colors you are lacking in since your final score is only as good as your weakest color.

Like the boardgame, you may have to be aggressive, in fact, you probably should be aggressive.

My main complaint is that the rules are really unclear on certain points.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
They eliminated what is (not kidding here) one of my favorite parts about the board game -- counting up your points every turn, and using that to figure out what to do next.  It's still a good game, but I don't like not knowing how well I'm doing in every color.

Comparing E&T:CG to E&T:BG is not exactly like comparing San Juan to Puerto Rico. Teaching it to someone who does not know the original game would be exceptionally hard. I did have fun playing it, but other than travel size I don't see a lot of reasons to play it over the original. I would go further to state that the original takes up an equal or lesser amount of table space which brings the "travel" portion into question too.

2006 acquisition.  It is a bit difficulty to image rows and column of cards being thriving empires and the game definitely has an abstract feel to it.  As such, the rules appear overtly complicated.  Our experience as a 2-player game has been somewhat lukewarm but perhaps more play would improve it.

This is an interesting port of the boardgame into a card game, but it really is unnecessary. Why not just play the boardgame? I found the card game aspect added nothing and subtracted much. Reiner should never be asked to re-visit his games. Razzia is equally unnecessary.

It works as a simpler version of the boardgame, and it is a pretty decent game in itself. Also, the cards are a bit more balanced than the tiles, without the placement restriction of the blue ones. What the game really lacks is the spatial element, and that makes it much less interesting. It is not significantly shorter, either, and uses a lot of table space. So, as others have commented, there seems to be not much reason to play it if you have the boardgame.

RATING: 6.5
Finally got to play this one! Well, let it me put this way... it can't reach the original, which isn't suprising at all, but it feels very close. In fact, this game may be too close, so that you will ask yourself, why you should get this one over the boardgame and that's where the game loses big time.

It needs atleast as much table space. It isn't much shorter. There's more luck involved. It's even harder to grasp for new players, since there's no board. The rules are more constructed.

So yeah, it's sucks in comparison, but the game itself is pretty huge for a card game! If I wouldn't know the boardgame, I would definitely rate this higher.

RATING: 7.5
In my first play, I played a rule completely wrong and was very disappointed.  After several more plays, I like this game more, although I don't think it lives up to the original E&T board game, which is my favourite game of all time.  There are a few things wrong with the new version:

1) Because you can't see your own points, it is more of a memory game, which makes my head hurt a little.  It is rare to see a game where your points are hidden from yourself!  I'll only play this game if we allow players to count their own points at any time.  (There is an official variant in the rulebook which suggests that all players have a stack of points for each colour, and I think it's a good idea, even if it allows other players to guess at the relative size of your stacks.) 

2) Because there isn't an action to discard cards of your choice and replenish them (unlike in the board game), you're very much at the whim of the cards that you get.  For example, you can be attached to ships (monuments), but not get any points because you don't have the cards in your hand to claim them!  Sometimes it's hard to get useless cards out of your hand to free up space for scoring useful points.

3) Even with three players, it's hard to fit all the leaders on the maximum of 8 kingdoms (and more like 3-4).  In the board game, you can usually pick an unused region of the board and start over (getting points in any category you need them using your black leader).  But the game works well with 2 players.

4) The box size is much smaller, and the cards serve a dual purpose as "tiles" and "scoring cubes", but the game is not exactly a "travel edition" (not that it's advertised as such).  The 8 columns of up to 9 cards (plus 7 spaces in between) take up a lot of space.  You could try stacking the cards, but then it's not obvious which card each leader is sitting on.

Other notable rules (that are not necessarily bad):

- The rule that I incorrectly omitted the first time I played:  when joining two kingdoms (by placing a card between two adjacent treasure cards in the top row), you can only join the kingdoms if each of the two adjacent treasure cards have at least 3 cards under them!  If you don't do this, then it's too easy to grab treasures.  A very important and good rule.

- The rule that I played incorrectly the next 2 times I played:  the green leader can only claim treasures after an external conflict, and only if that leader's owner has enough red cards to do so.  If you as the owner of the green leader do not have a red card in your hand, you cannot claim the treasure at that time.  Only after a new merger will you have another chance.  (This could be accomplished without conflicts by 2 actions:  catastrophe a merger card within this kingdom, then replace it with a new merger card.)  This also means that if there is a kingdom with more than one treasure but no green leaders, then just moving a green leader into that kingdom isn't sufficient to claim the treasures... there has to be another merger involving that kingdom.

- The rules say that a leader can be placed on any card except ship cards.  This means that it's legal to place them on treasure cards, and on "merger" cards which lie between treasure cards in the top row.

- The rules don't say that you can "pass" (do nothing) as one or both of your actions.  But they do say that each player "may take up to 2 actions", which means that 0 or 1 action is allowed.

- The rules don't allow you to use an action to voluntarily take a leader off the board (unlike in the E&T board game).  Removing a leader can be an important strategy in the end-game, to avoid giving someone a large chunk of points in an external conflict.  The only way I can think of removing a leader is to move it to a kingdom with another leader of the same colour, thus triggering an internal conflict and possibly giving the other player one red point, which is not always desirable.  But the lack of this rule is not a game-breaker.

- The rules say that you only can turn a string of 4 same-coloured cards into a ship just after you played a new civilization card to the end of a column (which is basically the same as the 4-tile monument rule in the board game).  This means that if you use a catastrophe card or an external conflict to make a string of 4 same-coloured cards come together, you can't just turn them into a ship without playing another same-coloured card to the end of the string.

- After careful reading and re-reading of the rulebook, only one rule is ambiguous: if one kingdom contains two ships, can a blue leader in that kingdom get two blue points each turn?  I say yes (because that's how monuments work in the board game).

I definitely like this game for 2 players.  I need to play this again with 3 and 4 players, but I'm more hopeful that I'll like it.  I'm so glad that this wasn't a waste of $15 and closet space (which is what I thought after my first play)!

I love the board game, so I bought the card game to have a travel version that I could use for proselytizing.  It's still a good game, but just doesn't live up to the fabulous depth and fluidity of the original. It makes up for this in some ways by introducing the agonizing choice of whether or not to use up a card in order to score points for a play. One thing I don't like is the linear arrangement of kingdoms - I wonder how it would play if you lined up the eight treasure cards in two rows, or in a square, and then allowed joining to occur between kingdoms that are side-by-side *or* across from each other.

Almost the same as the board game, only bigger.  Yes, I said bigger--spreading the cards out on the table requires more space than the board did. On the plus side, cards eliminate the need for annoying screens.  The conflicts happen earlier, since the physical relationships between kingdoms happen on one dimension rather than two, and there are fewer possible external conflicts. Otherwise, it has all the strengths and weaknesses of the original.  I considered giving it a lower rating for being completely superfluous, but in the end, it's still a good game that I enjoyed.

This is not as successful a conversion as San Juan, because it is no simpler or shorter - 90% of the effort for 60% of the fun.

First played this on May 7th, 2007.  If you have played the board game, this will make more sense and the rules will go quicker.  If not, there will be a hugh learning curve on how to play.  On the plus side, this game will play quickly compared to the board game.  However, the strategy seems to be more lacking or simply different.  I enjoyed the game play and would recommend it to those who love the board game, yet don't have time to play it out.  Be warned, it will leave something to be desired and you yearning to play the board game.

A fairly unique game to me, but I have not played Tigris & Euphrates.

Each player has a hand of cards, each card having one of four colors (no other attributes). These cards are played as tiles (and to score points) in an arm-and-branch geography (rather than a grid). The same cards also act as "ammunition" in conflicts for leader control (each player having four leaders, one of each color), and then collected from the battle as points. How these battles are carried out takes up most of the rulebook.

This game makes my brain hurt.

I've only played this once and it felt similar to the board game. The mechanics for conflicts and joining of kingdomes work great. Big advantage is the quicker play time. Drawback is that the conflicts still confuses the hell out of new players.

RATING: 4
Its an okay game for a stripped-down T&E, but probably too random, and its easy to feel lost and not in control. Because the turnover of cards-in-hand is so high, there isn't much long-term planning or hand management. I would recommend sticking with the boardgame.

I love the smaller version of E&T, and it's a lot of fun to play. It doesn't take as long as the original game, and it takes up a LOT less space.

RATING: 6
This actually seemed to do a good job of approximating the two-dimensional tile-strewn map of the original with a one-and-a-half-dimensional card display. It's not impossible that one or two features are actually more streamlined this way. However, the game ended just as it seemed to get going with external conflicts, the score-from-your-hand mechanism recalls a frustrating aspect of the original, and by default accumulated points are now hidden not just from other players but from everyone. It's a big game for the box size, but if that's not a factor, I can't see myself wanting to play this instead of the tile game. A handful of rules are less clearly presented in the English version.

I wanted to like this because the box was smaller than Tigris and Euphrates, so I thought we could pack as much fun as that into less space. But it actually takes more time to set up, it takes up a godawful amount of room on a flat table, and the rules aren't as intuitive as original Tigris.

The rules don't really make sense when viewed in light of whatever theme this game is supposed to have. Red cards can be used to start conflicts, or further conflicts, or resolve conflicts, or sometimes other cards can be used instead to start a different kind of conflict...

Okay of course you can compare it to the original which is deeper, less luck-dependent and so on. But Should you? It's a card game. It's a lot more about hand management than the original. It's a more tactical game. It has a larger role of luck. And it's fun and short. It's a card game. I like it. I don't love it (I love the original) but it's fine and being a lot shorter is definitely a big plus for me.

Played once.  Complex rules, but quite understandable once the game has started (assuming you have patient companions who will kindly explain the battle rules to you again and again during the game).  Heavy player interaction (everyone plays cards in the same space), much strategy (what to build, where to put leaders, whom to attack), a neat scoring system, and a moderate luck component (which cards are drawn) all combine for a great strategic game that seems like it should have great replayability.  Speaking of which, I want to play it more.  

The only modification I'd like is to play with the victory-point cards visible to the player they belong to.

I acquired this in the recent Australia/New Zealand maths trade and was looking for a game that my wife and I could play when the little Fish were asleep. We have tried this one a couple of times now; one game was a real ‘try out’ while in the next we tried various tactics and stratagems. 

This is quite an abstract game and not one we’d naturally gravitate towards, so trying out something new is now bad thing. So far neither of us is blown away by the gameplay, but were are both open to giving it a further try.

From our limited experience, I’m not sure this game will fit the bill for us. Given the way that conflict works in this game, I’m not sure that two players is optimal. I will try to get it on the table with three or four and see if that works better.

Will try a few more times and with differing numbers of players. If not, back into the maths trade.

Accidentally got this instead of Tigris & Euphrates. It's not bad in its own right. Definitely more random than Tigris and has an annoying memory-aspect where you can't examine your score pile. The rules are similar enough that it's easy to pick up this if you know Tigris.

Knizia's E&T with cards, where every player has a hand of 8 cards. The rules are very nearly the same as the board game. To earn VPs, however, one has to play the right type of card to the table, and take the corresponding card from their hand. There are at most 8 kingdoms, and the treasures are also represented by cards. The only trick is that you can only see the top card of your VP pile, so you may not remember which color you are short. It's a shorter version of the board game, and fun. I think it is lighter than the boardgame, since you have a hand of 8 cards, and that adds much more luck and uncertainty when you are conducting conflicts.

This is a game for serious people. It's something of an intellectual exercise rather than something you play for fun or that you'll be hanging on a thread with tension as you play: you play cards into columns and try to balance cards gained from among four colors: red, blue, green, and black. The reason you try to achieve balance is because the winner is the person who has the highest low number of cards. Follow? Probably not: the English translation and/or the writing of the rules presents several problems--so much so that I'd guess the overall rating of this game is down a good half-point because of it. So expect to do some work up front figuring out how to play (or check BGG 'rules' section for Q & A). On the other hand, once you figure out how to play, this game doesn't take too long for what it is, although 'too long' is going to be a matter of personal taste--or attention span. But once you figure it out, 45 minutes is pretty reliable. The small-format cards and the wooden disks that come with the game are, however, of good quality. This definitely takes more time than the average game to figure out. But hey, it's a Knizia game, so I can see there are many possible strategies in this game, so there is much replayability, even though each time the play itself is basically the same and your goal remains the same: end up with the highest low number among the four colors of cards you'll compile. As with many Knizia games, the theme is fairly thin, there's a varying amount of luck in the cards you'll draw, and game play is rather dry. That said, against the right opponent there is a lot of thinking to do with this game and many possible strategies, which makes it intellectually interesting. There are 185 Civilization Cards total (minus 30 for a 2-player game) that can be played, so it takes time to play all the way through all those cards. (A game ends when: 1) there aren't enough Civilization Cards left to fill out a player's hand to his normal allotment of 8 cards, or 2) there is only one Treasure Card left at the end of a player's turn (there are 8 such cards at the beginning of a game). One has to play a balanced number of "Victory Cards" of each of the four colors, because the game is decided based on the highest number of the lowest total of cards of a given color: Black, Red, Green or Blue. So, basically a good design and intellectually interesting, but by the same token, definitely dry as well. Note that I don't own the board game, so my rating is not in comparision to that, but rather, strictly about this version itself.

This is a quality and meaty card game, which is lighter compared to the boardgame, while still retaining the feel of it. This does stand on its own, though.

Quality cards and wooden pieces.

The cards are smaller than I'd like, but then the table space required for the game would increase. Therefore, instead of shuffling the large deck, I draw the cards Carcassone tile style.

I have yet to decide if E&T is better for a 2 player game than T&E.

Rating after one play at Essen 2005! I haven't played the original game and I felt lost many times throughout the game. I didn't like the fact, that there was no real board to play the cards on. After playing this I decided to buy the original at the fair. The cardgame definetly is NOT a standard card game, but has a very distinct ifnot unique feel to it.

Many similarities to the board version, but with less options. You place cards and gain points by having leaders in the area and then create internal and external conflicts. The one major difference is that you cannot look through your points, which is frustrating, so there is a memory aspect and to gain points, you must play the cards in your hand. Good if you need a quick Tigris fix, but otherwise, play the board game.

Not really that different from the Tigris & Euphrates board game, and it surprisingly requires more table space.  Linear kingdom merging makes the game a little easier to conceptualize what will happen.  Not a huge fan that scoring is supposed to be hidden from yourself.

Rec'd on 2/11/(2006?). First play: 4/15, 2 player. Takes up considerable table space for a card game, my first impression is to wonder why one would play this instead of the standard board game if 3-4 players were available? We played very fast, without much regard for what each player was doing - next play will concentrate more on counting cards and vps. 6/6: Played 3-4 more times 2p, realized that I'd been playing mergers wrong. You must have at least 3 cards below a temple before a section can merge with another. This prevents grabbing treasure after treasure, and gives a place where a displaced leader can find safe haven. Same rating (6), but there's hope. 2/2010: changed rating to 5, game is getting lost in the shuffle now. Oct 2014: 4.

Only one play, but I can't brake from the original. The card game feels to abstract and the original is rather abstract to begin with, so what does that say?

I like to be able to see the kingdoms actually develop on the board. I am simple that way I guess. The cards do cut down on the time but I play T&E as a deep game anyway so the time factor is not a bother to me.

Give me the original or give me a different card game to play.

I like the card game better than the board game because the card game plays quicker and I like how you must play a card out of your hand as a victory point.  It makes the player think, should I play this even though I don't have enough cards to give myself a victory point?  Game play is near the same...the card game had 3 ships instead of the monuments.  So overall, a nice, quick, and fun version of E& T .

Though very similar to the boardgame in mechanics, the feel is very different. We found that it does play considerably faster than the boardgame and had more conflicts.

The hidden scoring (hidden from all players including oneself) is a bit odd but has produced many surprises in our games.

While I find the board game thematic, this certainly seems abstract. It is much harder to visualize what is going on and, as a result, calls for a different type of thinking. I won't say that I'd rather play the board game because the card game is too much the same. Rather, I'd say the card game plays too differently and detracts from what I find fun about the board game (which I rate a 10).

Uhg.  I thought this game sucked...  and Im a reluctant fan of the full size boardgame.  

The mechanics feel just like the original, and it's that fact that makes me wonder why I would ever play this instead of the original.

The blaring problem for me beyond the card draws is that locations only share proximity to 2 other locals, and since these are smaller in nature than the original, they don't seem to work as well, and I felt like the game was drawing down to a power play between one massive city and a smaller one.

My play was with 2p and I really just felt it was a waste.  If this is ever recommended to hit the table, I'll vie for the original instead.

Dull. Dry. Not a big fan of the boardgame and this has just been invented to ram that message home. I'm told there's a theme in there somewhere. If I've got to try that hard to find it I really can't be bothered. If a game has its theme pasted on that's not that bad as long as the game play is fun, exciting, testing, interesting. This is just some sort of convoluted soup of mechanics without anything very clever thrown into the pot. Did I mention its dull? Your best bet just seems to pick up the right cards and have pairs to play. Make sure you get a good supply of reds and that's about it.

Feels a lot like the board game, but I prefer the original -- nicer to look at, better feel for relationships between kingdoms, nicer bits. The linear relationship between kingdoms is a bit odd, as is the requirement that kingdoms be at least size 4 before they can be joined: in my first game (2er) we built on opposite ends and I couldn't attack the other huge kingdom quickly enough 'cause I had to grow the intermediate kingdoms first! I guess that would happen less after repeated play, of course.

A very portable version of E&T! Of course, I'm not such a huge fan of the original, either....

Some people call it E&T lite. I call it E&T: The Movie. If the boardgame (rating ten imho) were a book turned into a film, this would be it. Yes, some of the sweep and depth of the narrative have been removed, but a few things have been added to give it pace. It helps to have "read the book" but this is a nice adaption for cinema goers.Probably not for E&T purists and perhaps bemusing to those completely new to the E&T genre. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
At first I seriously wondered about the need to use your own supply of cards as VP's and about not being able to gain more than 1 bonus strength from surrounding religious tiles. 

Having now played several games, I'm pleased with the variation that this provides over the base game though I'm not convinceed that it is sufficienctly different from the base game to warrant buying it. It certainly isn't as different as San Juan over Puerto Rico. Better played with the tiles from the original game as it takes up less space.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Nice portable version of E&T.  Captures a lot of the flavor of the original game but linearizing the regions changes (for the worse) the nature of external conflicts.  Internal conflicts are also drastically different since only the card under your leader can strengthen his position.  That makes luck a little more of an issue.  Still, if you're jonesing for E&T on the go then this is a pretty decent substitute for the real thing.  Other than that, there's really little reason to choose this over the original.

I have played many games of the board game version of this one and I will have to say I prefer it better than this one from a couple of playings.  Although on paper I had hopes that this would feel much the same but play quicker, in the end it simply felt a lot more chaotic (if you can believe that).  External conflicts are much easier to start and advanced planning is quite difficult, unlike in the board game.  I would always rather pull out the original than this card version.

Tigris & Euphrates Card Game could not replicate the success that San Juan had as a card game successor to Puerto Rico, mostly because there isn't anything truly original about the sequel, and although more portable it takes up the same amount of space on a table. It's basically just reducing the board in T&E by a dimension and changing a little bit of the rules around to accommodate the change from board to "line".

Not nearly as bad as many picture this game.
Of course it is not as good as the original, why expecting so?
But it's fast enough, rules aren't so difficult (but are not easy either, at first in the first turns) and there is quite a lot of planning, strategy, back or front stabbing, all condensed in a lot of cards.
Probably the only bad thing is that it takes a lot of space and a lot of sleeves if you want to protect it

What a disappointing game! I was hoping for a more streamlined, engaging game that still felt like T&E, but was simpler to grasp and quicker to play. It does play more quickly, but the game feels so herky jerky, and it plays so incredibly differently than the boardgame that it's a shame it uses the same name -- aside from lowest common denominator scoring in four colors and what triggers internal/external conflicts, the game feels awkward and remarkably unlike T&E. 

Sure, you get a larger hand size (8 instead of 6) but the fact that you need a card of whatever color you want to score in your hand when scoring is triggered means you have fewer actual options. Also exaggerating the problem of being short-suited as in T&E because, for some reason, there is NO option to exchange cards!! Have bad cards? Can you only play cards to trigger battles you can't win or score points for other players? Too bad!! 

Also a strange vibe that the only way you can get two kingdoms close to external conflict is to play enough cards to let the player on your left trigger the conflict -- it's nigh impossible to set up external conflict w/o receing an "alley oop" from the player to your right (intentionally or not).

Wife gave me this for Father's Day.  We played 4 players and she won.  Amazing, since she's not the type to play the full game.  I enjoyed it quite a bit!

It is indeed Tigris and Euphrates light... but like many others it just leaves me wanted to play actual T&E!  The missing full spacial element make it pretty easy to put together a single super kingdom and needing to have cards on hand to score makes managing the luck of the draw a little more of a pain than the tiles and board version of the game.  If you enjoy this never play the original and you can keep on enjoying the card game for what it is!

On the one hand it's kind of neat to have T&E in a portable format.  On the other, with how much space you need to lay all the cards out, you may as well be playing the board game instead.  I don't like the fact that you cannot remove an opponent's leader without resorting to conflicts (or by the more rare occurrence of converting the card it is on into a monument).  Neither do I care for how "kingdom" can only be separated between where the treasure cards are, there is no way to cut it off vertically, severely limiting the strategy.  A poor man's version no matter how you look at it.  Either play with the real thing, or get a different game altogether.

Fun, but I don't think it's different enough from the board game to make me want to play both (like Puerto Rico/San Juan, etc.).

I think this captures the essence of E&T in a quicker, easier to play version. Prefer E&T if I am up for a longer game tho...

Feels amazingly similar to its older sibling, [thing=42]the boardgame[/thing], but with some interesting little differences.  Also, it plays in about half the time, and is a little more portable.  So, now you can choose the appropriate representation of the Tigris and the Euphrates for your time constraints!  (Or, you could just play the land between them in [thing=19301]Mesopotamia[/thing].  Better still, play [thing=42]E&T[/thing] on one side, [thing=19419]E&T:WdK[/thing] on the other, and [thing=19301]M[/thing] in the middle!  Of course, that's 3 hours of games, but it's all in that same, fertile crescent!)

I wish I'd read about the differences between this and the board version before I'd bought this. Not too crazy about using cards from my hand for scoring. I'll give it a few plays before I write it off (and rate it).

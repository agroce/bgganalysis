Just won on eBay, eagerly awaiting for it to arrive in the mail.  I plan on playing this with my girlfriend and her roommates at a game day soon.  I'd played it before with Chris and Kara at the beach, and remember having a really fun time with it!  [update] Have played this several times since and always had a really fun time.  A lot of the pictures are hilarious in conjunction with the concepts you're trying to match, so there's always humor potential.  Partner games are really fun and I don't have too many of them.

PARTY

I first played this while in Sweden on college band tour. It's a fun, cooperative party game for couples or family pairs (brother and sister, husband and wife, father and son, mother and daughter, etc.) The idea is to see how "compatible" the members on each team are by comparing their answers after each round.

Recommended with 4 or 6 players (best 6). 30 mins.

For a while, especially when our party game group didn't have so many years of marital bliss under their belts, we seemed to play this game a lot.  We all got chuckles from the exclamations of frustration that were along the lines of, "How did you connect THAT picture to THIS subject?!?"  Fortunately, all the couples have stayed married.  We still break it out on occasion, and always enjoy it when we do.  [Thrift $1.09]

Box bottom is dished in, bowing sides.  Lid shows some shelf wear at corners.  All pawns, die, topic cards, double up cards, and player cards are present and accounted for.  One white card has a straight mark on the back, and one blue card shows some wrinkling.  Original rule set is missing, but a copy of Mattel's rules from the web is added.

JTs and my copy have a different set of cards, so I guess different editions have completely different pics.   

The game is fun, and is a nice change of pace after some more complicated games.   It's interesting to see the reasoning between some of the choices made, and how people see things in different ways.

Enjoyed it.  Maybe ranking it a bit higher than I should simply based on how well it went.  Was a good game to wind down a night.  Played very fast.  Little to no down time.  My wife and I were very compatible, so that helped. $2 from DI, so very good value  :)  (03/21/08)


This should be a fun filler.  Tommy and Doris feel that the cards are a bit dumb and outdated, and I tend to agree with them but this can be easily fixed with artscow.com

This might be somethign I actually give a try on there.  (11/9/09)

A fairly run-of-the-mill "what were you thinking?" kind of party game. For some of the keywords you really do have to make a mental stretch.

Great card/party game, and a bit underrated in my opinion. Ideal for a group of 2 or 3 couples, you attempt to match your partner's pictured answers to a card prompt. Very funny at times, and always provokes interesting discussions as to why people chose certain cards.

This is a really fun game to play with couples, with the kids, or as a party game.  It takes 5 minutes to learn and is really fun.  It's neat to see how people think differently.  If you play with couples, you can see which couples know each other the best, or you can split up and play with people you don't know and it's a good way to get to know them.

This is a great game for couples and to play with non-gamer friends. After this game, they will say "What else do you have" & in another month they'll be playing Puerto Rico (true story). If you play it too much with the same people or parnter is gets a little old.

I've always enjoyed this game.  Really fun to play with couples.  Played this recently with a married couple who ended fighting because they didnt select the same top card!! It was so funny! But alas, my hubby HATES this game, and always tries to "tabletalk" with me to get me to select the same cards as him. Needless to say, that is super annoying, and now I usually dont suggest it at parties anymore.  Sad too, because I really do enjoy this one!!

Team game, everyone is given a random word and then you must guess what your team leader will play to represent that word.

A fun party game.  Played in pairs of couples.  Each turn a card is turned up with a picture on it, and then each player secretly chooses three words that they think are best associated with the picture.  The words are then revealved, then couples are awarded points depending on the matches between their cards.  Would get predictable quite quickly, but the first few plays are fun and enlightening.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
My high rating comes from my personal situation. The game isn't the best out out there by far, but trying to guess your partner (or the other players) results in some amusing times and in-jokes for each game when certain cards are played at weird times.

We find it plays better as all vs all instead of teaming up.

RATING: 7
We had some fun with this one. It's kind of like doing the challenges in Imaginiff with the same person the whole time. You are trying to match consistently with one person. I would imagine that after a while, the cards get a bit tired. I have found this to be true in other party games with photographs for cards. Also a bit of a shame that it only accomodates 6 people. I see no reason why it couldn't include cards for more. Still, it it pretty entertaining to hear people arguing and trying to justify why they picked certain things and their partner did not.

Compatibility is a nice pairs party game where you and a partner each choose 1-5 cards from decks to match a prompt, and do this better than other teams by choosing the same cards in the same order as much as possible.  This is, in itself, a fun enough game.  The biggest problems (and older editions of Compatibility get these more right than newer ones) are the cards.  In the player decks some of the cards are pretty lousy, feeling like the designer got 2/3 of the way through and just started chucking in images and words to make the deck count.  Worse, the prompt cards, particularly in the newer versions sometimes go from strange to outright abstract.  Several times, I caught myself thinking about Kirk Van Houten trying to draw 'dignity' in Pictionary.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A great partnership game that works much better than it seems like it would on paper.  I like the creative element of the game, and it's fun to see how people's minds work.

The mains thing keeping it from rating higher with me are the play length, which is a tad too long, the scoring track, which is needlessly random (why not just have it decrease as you move on without other numbers thrown in), and the lack of variety in the cards you have to choose from.

I'm curious to see if the updated Asmodee version fixes any of these things.

This game is okay, there are a few joke cards that always get played. Some of my friends really love this game, I like it but wouldn't want to play it all the time. Shuffling through your cards can get tiring.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a fun game that helps you get an idea of how people think.  A lot of the enjoyment comes from explaining why you chose a specific card and seeing who else had the same ideas.  You do have to be careful of some couples who get into fights over each other's choices, and a few people defeat the purpose of the game by cheating to win (e.g., always playing the same cards).

Mark and I know that we're not particularly compatible in this game, but we do manage to win once in a while.  Most of the time, we have no problem playing as other people's partners.

A great game for couples. How well do you know your partner! The sad thing is when we play it more often than not, we find we match with everyone but our partner! This leads to interesting recriminations.

Wasn't expecting much, but this is quite a clever party game. I imagine this will only work with certain people, and best with couples.

Great party game ... especially as a couples game.  How well can you predict what your partner will play?  Given a word or phrase, pick the top 5 picture cards from your hand that match.  Will your partner pick the same ones.  The more you match, the more points you receive.  I have always enjoyed this simple game and there are plenty of word cards for high replayability

兩人一組，題目隨便找人出或輪流出，依各自計分標誌腳下的數字出同樣多的牌(蓋著)，同組的選好牌一起翻開，若是圖案相同位置也相同就+3分，圖案相同位置不同+2分，另外可使用暴氣裝置賭圖案位置都相同可以倍數暴分，先跑到終點就贏了。

The original Mattel edition is far, far better than the recent one.  But if you have neither, then the new one will suffice (with it&#039;s less interesting photos and card graphics).

Great fun, you can jump right in and like all good party games it doesn't overstay its welcome. Some lateral thinking and some empathy for your partner helps. Would need expansion cards to keep the interest up, but for now this was a great $1 find Kirsi!

Found at St. Vincent De Paul after seeing it in Zee Garcia's top 50.  Really fun family/party game trying to match cards with your partner.  Good for couples, or just random partners.  Not sure how replayable it is without adding new cards, but it's fun in the mean time and everyone loved it.

I have only played this a few times, but it is an interesting game to play with other couples. Trying to match what your partner will pick from an identical deck of pictures to match specific word is a challenge, that often works pretty well.

We really like this game. Everyone plays simultaneously so there is no waiting for turns. Random pairings make it even more fun. We also bought a second copy so we could play with up to 12 people.

I could see this being great if they ever made an updated version that improved on the roll-and-move aspect, and had better images.

As it stands, the roll-and-move just seems to have been tacked on as it is completely random and adds nothing to the game. A lot of the photos are dated, and some just have words printed on them. There is even one card that is completely black and one that is completely red. Very cheap.

A lively party game where 2-player teams try to think like their teammate by choosing the same descriptive picture from their identical decks to represent various things.

RATING: 8
A fine party game for people that know each other well. The original printing is preferred over the newer edition; the cards are much more interesting. Some great memories with this, from the time we secretly fixed the teams so that two "enemies" would have to be on a team together (they won!) to the aunt who would always play the rose to the father of the family friend who would come up with obscure stories relating unrelated cards, like "English" to a crayon drawing, and somehow matched his wife in the process. (Note - I've played this a lot before logging plays, so the count here is not accurate.)

another party game where the score does not matter, the activity is col and all, but passed the discovery it's not super fun... i'd rather play Dixit.

I have to agree with Zee Garcia on this one.  Great party game, especially if you're gaming with another couple or 2.  It gets pretty tough once you get down to needing to match just 1 or 2 cards with your partner!

This game plays great with non-gaming couples, but I really need another edition, so we can stop staring at the make-out couple all the time.

We play with a variant credited to Adam Smiles: on an exact match, that card is removed from the deck. This keeps a team from relying on the same cards (the studious guy, Satan, Julia Child) over and over.

This is a really good game under the right condition.  And the condition is you need 4-5 couples, hence the name.  This game usually makes it to the table on the dinner nights where it happens to work out.  I bought a second compatibility game so that we can have as many as eight couples.  More couples doesn't slow the game down. Everyone selects and plays together.  This is definitely an overlooked game.  I always learn something about our friends or guests, it's a great ice breaker and its fun to watch the dynamics between the couples, young or seasoned.

I always come out of this game with a fresh reminder that most people have a very different worldview than I do.

Your average person, for instance, doesn't associate flowers with angry red death.

A "qualified 8" that makes it a seven.  If you play with different people and switch up partners, its a very fun game.  If you play with the same partners, it gets very old, very quick.  Still, a nice game to introduce non-gamers to the world of board games.

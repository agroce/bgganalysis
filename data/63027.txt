The models in this are fantastic, and it's a solid aerial combat miniatures system, with a lot of content in the basic box...unfortunately, aside from the few fleet extensions they released, it's fairly low on content, and there doesn't look to be any more in sight.

Personally, I am not a fan of the gunnery system. The mechanics for Torpedoes are actually pretty cool. I have this and the two expansions for the models, which are magnificent. I hope to use them as the core of an Attack Wing/Flight Path-type game I'll try to put together.

The LOOK of the components of this game are stellar. The actual game rules are less so. Torpedoes are particular problems since then tend to slow the game to an absolute crawl. Also the small board and the big ships result in basically the same crowded game every time you play. It's hard to believe anyone would play this more than a few times which is a shame. It's a game in need of a larger playing area and some rules upgrades but I doubt it will ever see another edition.

Granted, it is a bit on the long side of things, but firing broadsides into the exposed stern of your enemy's flagship is tremendous fun. :)

I am very impressed with the way this game uses the  dice to take into account variables such as rakeing fire and moving targets. The production quality is excellent, and our first game left my friend and I eager for more.

A very good game.  The playing pieces are exceptional, very cool, very detailed.
The movement system is unremarkable, it's not new at all but it works perfectly.  
The damage system for the ships IS original, and works amazingly well to give the feeling of huge airships slugging it out.

Surprisingly good in a lot of ways--figuring out firing arcs was infinitely less tiresome than I anticipated, and the rules are pretty clean.
There are two major strikes against it, though, which are largely matters of personal taste:
a) Lots of counting hexes. I'm pretty much over hex-counting, what with games like Claustrophobia, the D&D coops, and tabletop minis games having shown me how wonderful it is to forego such tiresome exercises.
b) Torpedos are neat in theory, but they seem to beg for AP in practice (or you just wing it, in which case, out of the box the French are underpowered).

For a small-scale ship skirmish game, I love the depth that the different dice and locations give you. Ships can take a lot of damage before they die, but lose abilities and fighting strength as they get hurt. I'm waiting to see what the upcoming altitude rules add.

Pretty basic naval game, with even less terrain than sea-based designs.  I found the larger ships too easy to hit and too reliant on multiple slots to avoid damage.  That said, it is visually impressive and plays "cleanly" once players know the system.

Need to play this more: the 2 games were both learning the rules.

2/6/17: have been playing more, teaching myself the finer points of movement,  torpedo usage and how the different ships play.  Still need to try the battleships, though. 

I really wish Catalyst would find a way to revive this one.

Flying Giants in the sky?  The same guy who did the Battletech world brings this to us.  However, I am not sure if the ships can appeal as much the 'Mechs in terms of speed, agility, maneuverability.  Also, would the world in 1910s or 20s of flying ships illustrated as richly as that in 3030s? 

Bought it at preorder price - still very expensive from the publisher direct.

A very strong game system utterly mis-managed by Catalyst Game Labs. Really great, but needs a re-do with a different sales model (more like X-Wing, maybe). A clear labour of love that should have had a better plan from the start.

As an aside, I had component problems that took most of a year to sort out, the high point being Catalyst shipping me an empty box from the U.S. Finally got it sorted, but it was possibly the worst customer service I have ever had and kind of took the shine off the whole game.

Sold. Terrible customer service left too much of a bad taste and the system has been put out to pasture. Might be relaunched, but not holding my breath.

RATING: 3
Lieutenant's Manual - 6.0
Commander's Manual - 7.0

Rating after 2 games. Some of the rules from the Commander's Manual improves the gaming experience significantly.

More movement options! Now you can perform stationary hexside turns and sideslips.

More damage! With Turrets, Saturation Fire and Bracketing Fire, ships go down much faster. 

More damage options! Torpedoes and Ramming!

Biggest complain after first game is duration. Second game is much faster because of more options from the Commander's Manual. 

Some of the rules from Commander's Manual which I feel will increase game duration:
- Torpedoes.
- Offensive Screening and Defensive Screening.
- Basically any rules that need LOS.

Some of the rules which speeds up game duration:
- More movement options!
- More firing options and improves firing arcs (with Turrets).

Update: 3
Sorry, this is not a fun game. No desire to play again. Considered money wasted.

Sold.

I waited quite some time for this game to come out and it was worth the wait. The time spent in development is apparent in the overall quality. With the exception of torpedoes the rules do a very nice job streamlining play. The entry level rules do a nice job of letting players grasp core concepts, but I'd advise moving to the commanders manual level of play as soon as you can as it is much better balanced. 

Beautiful minis, a rich setting and some of the best packaging made this a great buy. Can't wait for the expansions.

You buy this for the cool minis and for the world-building immersive storyline which invites full player participation through Creative Commons licensing (a first for board game design?) The actual rules are fine, the system is well executed, but it's nothing that won't be familiar to anyone who hasn't played a naval wargame. The altitude rules, when they're out, will make it or break it as a game worth playing.

Initially was very curious about this but the release keeps getting pushed back and Dystopian Wars seems to be stealing the thunder. The new French DW model even looks identical to the design of the Leviathans models Also disappointed in the hex based movement, prefer more open table top. With this game not scheduled to launch until GenCon 2011 I worry it may be dead before arrival. We'll see.

I have yet to play this as a game, but it is a beautiful confection. It is a game involving airborne battleships (superb not-so miniature miniatures) in a steam-punk universe in around 1910. The game doesn't just come with an atmospheric backstory but sets up an entire alternative history.

Loaned to Steve;

This is going to take some house rules tweaking to get on our regularly played rotation.  Going through the quick start scenario, our 2-on-2 ship game lasted roughly 4 hours, including setup and figuring out the rules.  2-2.5 hr games are our current limit.

Ships are damned nice, though.

RATING: 7
Fun game with great miniatures and lots of dice. While the theme is only okay, I like the mechanics a lot. The color/die-type for weapons and armor is fun, and crossing off damage on the ship card reminds me a lot of SFB. It's a slugfest with a lot of potential for future expansions.

RATING: 6
Beautiful minis, great components except the board which was printed badly off alighment when to attached the two boards and not just a bit. The rules could've used a bit more explantations concerning the pegs, height, how to distinguish the ships, icons on the ship card.

RATING: 6
Great mini's, lots of fun, but you can't take it too seriously. Lots of randomness. You actually end up rooting to see your ship to get blown up.  The game kind of peters out as everyone gets damaged, losing guns and tesla coils, reducing their ability to do any further damage. X-Wing with the big ships like Millenium Falcon is definitely a better game while still providing the fun factor of moving big ships with lots of guns, but I do prefer the hex-based movement. But Blue Max/Canvas Eagles with minis on telescoping rods is definitely the best air combat game.

Beautiful, painted minis;  steampunk setting with flying battleships....what more can you ask for?  Actually, fun game, not unnecessarily complicated (although it could get to be so using future rule additions).  A couple ships plays out in a couple hours (faster once one gets the system under one's belt).

Got two starter sets on Miniature Market for clearance price of $50 each. Rulebook is not bad, but wonky in spots. Calculating firing arcs and then damage arcs is the one bit that mystifies/annoys me. Not really liking the rules for aerial torpedoes and their implementation into gameplay.
Minis are nice, and delicate.
CGL did a good job with creating the background to the Leviathans world.

Great potential here, but I haven't seen enough from the developers in the way of support to fully commit.

This is an airship combat game set in an alternate history.  The game is set in the late 19th century where a piece of technology called the Tesla coil was invented allowing air ships to fly.

I find the gunnery mechanic in this game to be somewhat unusual.  In many games, I can look at the weapons and defences of a ship and have a general idea of how good it is.  With this game, it is not entirely clear how good the weaponry is.  

Also, the way the damage table works, if one side of a ship has all of its areas hit, no further hits on that side of the ship does any more damage.  This may not happen often, but it still makes things a little weird for me.

The game is played on a hex grid.  The smaller destroyers are very nimble.  They can make multiple turns on each movement.  I find that when you have many destroyers, it makes the movement take a long time because you have so many options on how destroyers move.  The larger ships are more limited in their movement.

When I played this game, I find that it is very easy to misread some of the abilities of the weaponry on the ships.  The different weapon abilities are indicated by little symbols.  When I played, my friend misread it quite often.

Overall, I enjoyed playing the game, but I find the pace is a little slower than I would like.  Although, the strength of the weapons is difficult to really determine, it at least gives me a little less to worry about.  I just make sure I can bring as many to bear on my enemy targets as I can and let the dice to the rest of the work.

One of the lucky ones to score a copy at Origins. Packaging is outstanding. Playing  tomorrow. Stay tuned for first impressions.

After 1 play: not ready to pin a rating on it, but after a few turns, the game zipped along and looks promising for many more fun-filled sessions.

Another play recorded. Time to give it an initial 9. This a case where the minis and components look terrific out of the box and there is an equally good game to go with it. 

OK. It's a 10.  A battle of wits and will that has you reading your ship cards between games and thinking up new strategies for the next battle.  I had my twin port  torpedo mounts blown to hell early in the last battle and lost my most effective offense. Hint: Don't ram an opponent's sky ship with a destroyer.

Leviathans was well worth the wait. 

One year later: AP slows the game when moving around torpedoes. Simplifying this through improved game aids or perhaps a chess timer is needed.

Picking the dice for your attack is the neatest part of the game, unfortunately it's also the most fiddly. It's a clever idea that in practice slows things down. I don't mind a game getting slowed for tactical considerations, but just to pick what dice to roll is a bit tough. Still, not a bad game.

Impulse buy. 

Terrible rulebook

Not enough of the custom dice come with base set

No dry-erase markers come with game

There are an assortment of story books that are not at all necessary.


Even with all these flaws and the hefty pricetag... I don't regret buying this at all. There is an awesome battle-fleet-gothic-esque game (without the vagueness of tabletop and tape measure) in the box also.

I like it.  its a miniatures game on a board.  I do want to repaint my ships to give them a bit more depth and detain (plus use some putty to fill in the gaps.  but overall I like the game.  I played a demo at pax east, bought it, then played "for real." the addition of more ships and torpedos really make the game take on a whole new level.  However, the rules arent the easiest to follow.

A steampunk slug-fest.  Battleship in the air.  It seems to be all about maneuvering to make use of your best weapons.  I like it for what it is.  A slug-fest with cool minis played out on a board to regulate movement via hexes.  I give it an extra point for the painted minis which are also nicely sculpted.  Nuff said.

RATING: 7
Pros:
Gorgeous components and minis
Lots of extras (poster, book, recognition cards) that add to theme
Several free download
Pretty easy to understand rulebook with many examples
Each of the ships has its unique strengths and advantages that require different tactics

Cons
Minis a bit hard to differentiate, especially since you use the same models for multiple ships.  Expansions just makes this worse.  
Stickers are useless since would have to change stickers every time used mini for a different ship 
Map hexes are misaligned
This is not a fast paced game.  It can take quite a while to go through all of the gun batteries for all the ships that may be firing on multiple sides.
The optional rules add more chrome and theme, but slow game down even more.
Really need bigger boards for maneuvering the big ships.

Overall gameplay is a 6 just because it is a bit of a slog, but the cool minis and theme bring it up to a 7.

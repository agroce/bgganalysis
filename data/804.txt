Another one that sounds pretty fun and casual.  

This is one of my favorite games of all time.  I can't think of a time when I wouldn't want to play it--there's so much fun in throwing dice and shooting the other players. 

Two house rules I use:

Cars are repaired based on their rank, so double 4's can restore the smallest car, double 5's the medium or small, and double 6's any.  

This keeps people in the race a little longer and has each roll, even if all their cars are wrecked, have a chance to bring them back in the game. 

The other rule is the driving through wrecks rule.  

As written, you have a 50% chance of barreling through or becoming a wreck yourself.  I make it so that you only become a wreck on a 1 or 2, to increase the odds people actually try to wreck through.  I've found the 50/50 odds mean people never even attempt.

A post-apocalyptic road combat/racing type game with simple rules, a lot of fun, and great art/pieces. One of the coolest rules is that when someone drives off of the end of the board, the last board section is cleared and connected to the front section; any cars still on the last section are left behind and out of the game! It's awesome!

I have a collection of special power cards and extra vehichles I use to play an "advanced" Thunder Road variant:

Fun, if a bit samey. The player who goes last seems to be at a slight disadvantage. 

I remember playing a 16 player variant many years ago. I have two sets, so will make an 8 player board one day. And it&#039;s a game begging for variant boards too.

Another one of those games in which you get the feeling they spent way more time making sure it looked cool rather than making sure it played well.  It has the potential to be fun, but one player (or two) usually gets knocked out early, leaving them to watch the others play while they hope to roll doubles sixes when their turn comes around.  When that's you... ugh.

I've played it more recently, and it's still pretty fun.  There is some tactical positioning, but mostly it's a dice-fest.  And for a dice-fest, it could use some more dice!  The endless board is a pretty cool idea that i don't know if I've seen since.

RATING: 7
Nice simple roll, move, and maybe attack game. The game never drags although the strategy is limited. Really, strategy consists of either outrunning your opponent, or boxing them in, where they're stuck taking that 50/50 shot at ramming a wrecked car.  It's a dicefest, but deciding where to move your cars can make those dice work to your benefit.  Because of the 3 dice rolls regardless of # of vehicles, the luck factor when moving is forgiving.  Attacks favor the person that's "losing" which keeps things interesting. Not a deep game, but good fun.

Hrrm, the high ratings on this one must just be the nostalgia talking!  It certainly has cool looking bits and a fun sounding theme, but the game is nothing more than roll and move, with some boring d6 fighting for ramming and shooting other cars.

The fun of this game is in the direct competition involved in the gameplay.  Unfortunately, there are not very many elements of the game and the gameplay hardly varies per turn.  The addition of more factors in gameplay and further chaos (such as through the addition of more vehicles) would make each turn much more interesting.

I don't see potential for many play-throughs of this game, but it is easy to learn and is great for inspiring competition.

Milton Bradley's answer to Mad Max. You rocket your team (three cars and a helicopter) down a stretch of post-apocalyptic highway and try to either wipe out the other teams or outdistance them and leave them in the dust. Each turn consists of a dice roll to determine car movement and a combat phase where you try to shoot or ram your opponents. The gameboard consists of two pieces of highway and when the lead car exits the front piece of highway, the back piece is placed in front (after dumping all the wrecks and slowpokes off of it) thus creating a never-ending gameboard.

This game is like a very simplified Car Wars.  It reminded me of The Road Warrior when I first saw it too.  Both those tie-ins made this game an easy pick.  And for me, it does the job.  It is easy to learn and is creative enough to be engaging, in a juvenile way.

You chuck dice, move cars and chuck more dice - That's it and honestly that's all I want. It's like watching a little car chase unfold in front of you. There's moments of excitement as your helicopter manages to land that '6' on their hulk and glee when you make a regeneration roll bringing you back from the dead. This is just really good fun. But if I were to be honest, not a really good game.

Fast-paced post-apocalyptic car races in a Mad Max style future world seem quite cool, and they are! This is a light filler game, easy to play, and good for many laughs as you destroy and outrun your opponents, smash or shoot them, and try to win by being the only one left or so far ahead that all others will just see your smoke cloud in the distance. But beware - they might have an attacking chopper left, spoiling your fun, and turning the tide to their favour. One of the better MB games of the 80s.

This game tends to remind me of the movie Mad Max: The Road Warrior.  It even uses similar looking car designs!  If people remember the end of that movie where there was a mad dash on the highway where there was a lot of ramming and shooting.  Thunder Road is essentially the same thing and it's a lot of fun.  Not all that complex, but it's a quick game to learn and a full fledged destructive race to the end!

This is one of only a few MB games from the 1980s that I don't remember as a child.  Yeah, it was taking advantage of Mad Max craze, but TR it does the theme very well.  Although it's almost a pure dice-fest, the gameplay is interesting enough, with multiple ways to attack and drive. And the theme is so rad that it also helps mitigate the more-than-usual lack of strategy.  Many opportunities for risk-taking makes this 1980s children's filler float to the top!

An excellent game. Especially for it's time. Off-road destruction racing at it's best. Don't be fooled by it's age or looks. This is a very good and fun game. Yes there is some luck involved due to the dice, but that didn't bother me much due to the quick play time. I just wanted to hop in and play another game and then another. It's always fun to run people off the road and then shoot at them. Well in a game anyway. So take that road rage out on this game, and you will feel alot better.

This is a simple, fast paced game that can be fun for a couple of diversionary games, but there is little strategy here. Best played with max players and lots of smack talk.

Prizes go to the game winners as well as the best looking cars. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Although I really like racing games, Thunder Road doesn't really qualify. It is much more about outlasting everyone else and killing them before they kill you. Driving very fast is one way to do this, but hanging towards the back and ramming is also a good option. 

It comes in a giant box full of classic Milton Bradley plasticky goodness and a couple of boards that are almost certain to be somewhat warped by now. But it looks great on the table. It has a gritty, post-apocalyptic, yet 1980's feel. 

Thunder Road is one of my favorite filler games. It does an excellent job of really telling a compelling story and immersing you in the game despite how fast it plays. It is sure to elicit cheers and moans, yet contains a decent amount of meaningful decisions as well. It's not deep, but it is very thrilling.

NOTE: We do play two minor houserules, which I think improve it significantly.

1. Driving through a wreck only crashes your car on a 1 or 2 instead of 1, 2, or 3 as in the rules.
2. Repair rolls are based on the rank of the car. Rather than only double 6's allowing a repair, double 6's can repair any one of your cars, double 5's can repair your medium or small car, and double 4's can repair your small car only.

Road Warrior influenced no-holds-bar demolition derby on a set of two boards that create a never-ending road. Game plays best with four players as the cars pile up and make constant conflict inevitable. While luck is a major factor the short play time (20-40 minutes), and the constant screw factor make this an enjoyable filler game.

This is a good one! Prefer it with the repair variant of 44, 55, 66 thats about, and its then a quick, brutal but surprisingly "accurate" representation of a Mad Max style death race... hmmmm,  a death race 2000 variant is calling!  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The game is quite easy to get into.  As in any game, reading the rules is a must. The rules themselves are clear and in-depth enough without losing beginning players on the first run. The many game pieces are quite small though, so be wary of losing parts if you're not careful. Normal gameplay seems to estimate from 15 to maybe 30 minutes, depending on how the game develops.
It is good to note that gameplay seems to pick up when each player is left with one viable game piece in play, at which point it's just a matter of time before game end.
Good recommendation for casual gaming.

One of the best "roll and move" games, because you get to choose which of three dice you "assign" to which of three vehicles.  Nice bits, great "Mad Max" theme, and lots of tension.  Somewhere between filler and party game, but with an occasional decision to be made.  F-U-N, Fun!

RATING: 7
+1 rules are light, intuitive and easy to teach. Rulebook is ok. 

+.5 rules are more than the sum of their parts. Ratio of strategy:rules-complexity is good.  There's a little elegance to it - but it's by no means head scratcher or a deep strategic experience.

+1 Novel mechanic of the endless road works really well. Rapidly leaving things in your wake by clearing them off the board and disappearing that part of the board does make the game feel fast-moving. 

+1 Thematically works quite well and theme underscored by mechanics. Endless barren road, things disappearing in the distance behind you. weaving and bashing and shooting. Very Mad Max. 

+.5 there are very well finished and fleshed out 'advanced' rules which can be added to add another level of strategy which is very fun... However, this does also add complexity, and Requires a bit of arts and crafts, or using print-out pieces. Your mileage may vary (heh). 

+.5 the box art and board look cool. But the car miniatures (for a car racing game based on a car-centric movie) are meh, and the board can warp over time. (but hardly a damning criticism of a >30 year old board that's still playable). 

-1 Does not play nearly as well with 2 people. 

-1 end game can at times be a dragged out dice-rolling slog. 

-.5 For a fairly light game, the huge board, lotsa pieces, and set-up time add weight.


A fun, light dice-roller with a little elegant strategy, and a few novel mechanics that really bring the post-apoc, mad max feeling out.

RATING: 8.5
At first glance of the cover art, this game screams "Road Warrior: The Boardgame", but it's more than that. It's not some Car War clone, it's a cutthroat race in the post-apocalyptic wastelands where the winner isn't the first across the finish line(none exist in this infinite road), but the last car driving.

The game only took a few minutes to review the rules and get the gist of how to play. Set up is fast and easy to remember. Heck, the setup essentially continues as the game progresses as players leap-frog the two road boards as soon as the leading car passes the edge of the board. Each player has 3 racing vehicles ranging from a dune buggy (cleverly named the "Doom Buggy") to a large tank of car appropriately named "The Eliminator" and all players have an attack chopper that is not a racing piece, but rather a "once-per-track" chance to trip up other players who have a shot to speed ahead and dump the competition, or for revenge.

The track is also littered with wrecks that provide obstacles for any players wanting to use the road for the movement bonus. The wrecks can either be dodged (with practically minimum effort since they only appear on the road) or passed through at one's own risk. If a car is wrecked, it can be saved if you can roll double 6s, which can be so hard that usually wrecks have only 2 chances at being repaired before being dumped and removed from the game.

In all, this game was a great fast paced combat racing game that is easy to pick up and play and replay. If there isn't already some kickstarter to reboot this game then someone reading this, or previous reviews, should definitely start one. They only change that I would recommend for a modern remake of the game is that the new game incorporate dual-sided boards to increase the variation of the race and keep everyone on their toes, even those in the lead position.

In this car-racing game, you're trying to eliminate your opponents by either blowing them up or getting too far ahead of them.  While everything comes down to the luck of the dice, the game is fun in a silly sort of way.  Player elimination can be a factor though, as an eliminated player can be waiting around a while as the remaining players finish.

FINALLY found a copy of this one at a local thrift (Eco-Thrift) for $.99! Choppers are busted up, but otherwise complete. :thumbsup:
I'd been looking for about 2 years now and never been fortunate. 

Want to try this out with the family.

Possible (designer-approved) variant to try:
Tweak the repair rolls so that you only had to roll doubles equal to or greater than the rank of a car to fix it. That means the large car still needs double-sixes, but the mid-size can be fixed on double fives or sixes, and the buggy can be repaired on double fours, fives, or sixes.

Actually quite a fun little game. Each player controls three cars and a helicopter. The cars race along a board consisting of two rolling boards, shooting at each other and being shot at by helicopters. If a car gets to the end of the road the other board is lifted up, any car on it eliminated from the race and placed at the front. In my Uni club this was quite enjoyed as a short fun distraction.

Very fun Ameritrash fare.  Pretty much pure luck, but is great fun racing the really nice mini's on the never-ending road of post apocalyptic road warriorness.  Only takes about half an hour to play so what could be wrong with that?

The only slightly dud thing is when you come down to the end with just 2 people racing on the road is a little anti-climactic after the initial frenzy of ramming and shooting, but assuming the last people alive will force a confrontation and won't just try to keep out-rolling each other, it'll be over in just a turn or two.

Good fun.

RATING: 7
Silly, light Ameritrash fare. Players are trying to eliminate their opponents, Mad Max style.

Roll three D6 and assign movement points to each of their vehicles. Vehicles move along a gridded board and it can either shoot or ram opposing vehicles depending on which space it stops on.

Attacks resolves on a D6. Hits from the chopper and shooting if you roll the value of the car (4, 5 or 6). Otherwise, ramming means each player rolls a D6 and adds value of their car. High roll destroys rammed car.

The selling point is the constantly moving board. Once a car runs off the end of the front board, the rear board is moved and connected to the (now old) front end. Any vehicles remaining are dumped. You can revive a destroyed vehicle if you roll a double six...but if it gets dumped, too bad.

Some flaws: choppers are quite powerful. The game is a huge luck fest. The last player tends to be able to attack more often than not. 


Still, it's fast and silly enough that I'd probably play it if someone suggested it.
Crying out for variants. Must explore those on BGG. Or sell the game, whichever comes first.

It's like Mad Max only it's Mad Me. Sure, it's simple, and somewhat random, but there's a little helicopter, and a bunch of plastic cars with guns, and you get to shoot at your friends, and family as if you were on the 310 during rush hour. If you disagree post it on your bumper, so I can run you off the road in my barbed wire ensconced Prius, or blast you with the 50 cal mounted on my roof ( and don't worry, I use a brass catcher so I can reuse the spent shells).

I noticed a PNP version is available, but I strongly suggest seeking out cars to fit the genre. It's all about the cars. Who cares about running a chit off the road, or flipping a chit, or repairing your chit? I'm sure some hot wheels could easily be modded to fit the bill.

My current copy was made in Ireland, and I'm not sure why I'm so proud of that.

[i]"If I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die historic on the Fury Road!"[/i]

Okay, the trashy classic that is Thunder Road was released almost 30 years before the amazing spectacle that is Mad Max: Fury Road, but the quote applies very well to this game.  (Milton Bradley's 1986 release was an obvious love letter to The Road Warrior and Beyond Thunderdome.)  Each player controls three vehicles and a helicopter racing down a highway trough a post-apocalyptic wasteland.  What is the prize for this race... a tanker of gasoline?  An oasis of water?  Avoiding being pasted across the hot asphalt?  Whatever the prize, there is a sense that your survival depends on you leaving your competitors as mangled wrecks far in your rear-view mirror.  To that end, you must ram, shoot, and speed past the other drivers any which way you can.

The game has a neat mechanic in which the arrow-straight highway and surrounding ditch are portrayed on two separate interconnected boards.  Once the first car drives off the lead board, the back one detaches, dumping any stragglers, and is moved to the front to become the new lead board.  The more cars get dumped, the fewer cars left to reach the end of this infinite highway to nowhere.  The last player who still has cars on the board is the winner.

Great fun with many laughs, cheers, and groans of despair.  This is what simple beer and pretzel games should aspire to.

Two plays.  One was pretty great and the other was not as fun.

I think I will love this as soon as I find the right group.




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 1
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 1
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 3
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 4


Overall - 1

The original Mad Max game. There's absolutely nothing wrong with it. Super fun, super dumb, and the only thing missing is a little, bloody shoe and teddy bear sticker to make it real.

A blast from the past, but not one worth bothering with anymore. Very simplistic and random. Might be fun for young children though.

A fun but not very deep game, Thunder Road makes a nice, simple, violent time filler.  Very straight forward gameplay and easy to learn, for the inner child of Mad Max in all of us.

The never ending road that simulates outracing your enemies is a nice, cool touch.  Fine game components too: various road warrior-ish looking cars and choppers, as well as wrecked cars for terrain obstacles!

Thunder Road is Hasbro's answer to Car Wars. You rocket your team (three cars and a helicopter) down a stretch of post-apocalyptic highway and try to either wipe out the other teams or outdistance them and leave them in the dust. Each turn consists of a dice roll to determine car movement and a combat phase where you try to shoot or ram your opponents. The gameboard consists of two pieces of highway and when the lead car exits the front piece of highway, the back piece is placed in front (after dumping all the wrecks and slowpokes off of it) thus creating a never-ending gameboard.

Member the tv advert for this from way back when? I do but at the time I never actually managed to wangle a set,but now i got  one on e-bay for £4! while the rules as printed arent amazing it plays well and quickly and the bits are great, nice mad Maxy feel to it too, worth looking for

I had this game when I was a kid, but it has since been lost to the ravages of time.

A favorite of mine from childhood. Lots of roll and smash action. Cool leapfrogging board idea. House rules spice it up: eaiser repair options being a must for older gamers (it makes the game longer).

RATING: 5
Having no childhood nostalgic attachment to Thunder Road, I can only say that this roll and move game is a passable entertainment.  I'm not sure if I like the pseudo-elimination concept where you keep taking your turn hoping to roll double sixes to revive your vehicle when all of them have been taken out.  Then there is the fact that the race could go on for quite a while.  It's ok, but I think I've seen all there is to offer with my one play.

I know this isn't one of the most complex games around but I played it a ton as a kid. Now that I'm an adult in my 40's I still enjoy it a great deal-even if I have to play it by myself these days. If you're a fan of 80's post-apocalyptic flicks like Road Warrior you should pick this up. There are lots of fun alternate rules out there now plus the format just begs to be modded with custom vehicles. It also makes a pretty cool diorama.

Very simplistic, but not bad if you want to play a very quick burnout racer. My Rating would be higher if more random track layouts were included, like narrow lanes, twisty roads etc.

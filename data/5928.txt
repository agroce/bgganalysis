To go along with this will be Battles of the Third World War and a selection of GHQ Micronauts Harpoon miniatures in 1/2400 scale.  The miniatures are:

CVN71 Roosevelt (in box)
LHD1 Wasp (loose, w/decal sheet and instruction sheet, missing 2 or 3 Harriers from their sprue)
BB61 Iowa (in blister)
CGN36 California (in blister)
CG52 Bunker Hill (in blister)
DDG Arleigh Burke (in blister)
DDG Spruance (in blister)
FFG57 Reuben James (in blister)
FFG1052 Knox (in blister)
PHM1 Pegasus (one pack of 3)
SSN Los Angeles (one pack of 3, loose)
SSN Sturgeon (one pack of 3)
Carrier Attack Aircraft (one blister pack)
SAC Bombers (one blister pack)
Landbased Strike Aircraft (one blister pack)
SS Norway  (in box)

All miniatures are complete except Wasp which is missing a couple of Harriers.  The missing aircraft will not affect your ability to build the model.  Roosevelet and Norway are in boxes but were opened, both are complete.  Missing the box for Wasp.  The Los Angeles subs were removed from their blister.  The remaining minis are still sealed in their blisters, however the top of each blister (cardboard only, not the plastic blister) was cut off at some point.

RATING: 6
I would have given Harpoon a score of 10 if evaluating it as a simulation, as it is superb and one of the most realistic naval warfare games available on the mass market.  As a game, however, that same detail and realism limits the number of times I've been able to play it with others.  Well executed and complex.

In theory I like this but in practice I think I'd need something simpler. Also concerned that modern naval combat distances are not conducive to a miniatures game ie too much empty board.

RATING: 6
30 second turn works for aircraft, missiles and ships - doesn't work for submarines. The emphasis is on technology rather than tactics - i.e U.S sonar will detect at this range in nautical miles..soviet sonar at this range...This generally means side with best equipment wins (usually U.S). There should be more scope for tactics - e.g a diesel boat stopped or at steerage speeds (2knots or less) should be undetectable by passive sonar so there should be potential for ambushes. Fantastic reference material. Too much bookeeping that doesn't add anything. Needs a referee for full enjoyment - lots of good ideas though, it can be fun if you have the spare time to commit.

It's hard to criticize this game for being too complex, as that was its purpose -- to capture in super detail the reality of modern naval conflict. 

In the end, however, it was way to complex to ever actually play with my group.

The best game for modern naval combat (1945-present) with clear, concise rules similar to Seekrieg 5.  Is notable for providing players with the model structure so that they are literally able to go to Combat Fleets of the World or Jane's Fighting Ships and take a ship produced after the game was published and bring it into the game.

At first brush not the best Modern Naval board game, but will grow on you if you use your imagination to build strong  scenarios. There are more modern scenarios available online.

RATING: 7
This is more of a simulation than a game, it can be fun with the right people but finding them is really hard. Lots of people used to play it in the early 90s during the last days of the Cold War, specially after the book Red Storm Rising came out. 
The system is simple but it requires an understanding of algebra and how to plot a course in paper. 
Not for everyone but extremely fun if you like naval strategy on a small scale. (don´t try to get more than 10 missiles flying at the same time)

I am in awe of Harpoon -- but perhaps more as an educational resource than an actual game.  Therefore, I don't know exactly how to rate it.  I've settled on "9" for the moment, because I think it deserves that much respect.

RATING: 7
Mas complejo y rico en detalles que Command at Sea, pero es un poco injugable, demasiada preparación para la diversión que produce.
Mucho mejor es la versión para PC, donde ya viene todo preparado, pero es muy antigua.
También es un buen juego para jugar por correo.
El tema y el juego es alucinante, pero la jugabilidad y las horas que uno necesita para preparar una partida echan para atrás, si encima tus jugadores no saben nada de guerra naval, te pueden destrozar el escenario.

My fourth wargame, after Flight Leader, Tac Air and MBT. Was inspired to buy it after reading "Red Storm Rising". Still a great game, but I much prefer its younger incarnation, H4 for its higher fidelity in the model :)

RATING: 9
A fun simulation type system, rather than a true "game", in my opinion.

Learning curve is steep, though, and scenarios with many ships or aircraft can take quite a while to game, especially if using subs.

Not for the weak of heart, but TONS of fun!

Many, many, many hours spent playing this fantastic game. However, almost all of them were solo. Did a very few ship v sub games as the referee but players just got bored and never played again due to the fact they never spotted the enemy and just died. Also, the success rate of some weapon systems - notably SAM's and ASM's leaves a bit to be desired. I remember flying 30 MiG-21's towards a Norwegian airbase and almost every one was shot down by SAM fire before they got in weapon range. It just didn't feel right. I would honestly half the kill/hit chances of every weapon in the game. Also, don't really like the maths/hit points system. I think Shipwreck does a far better job but lacks the gloss of Harpoon.

When GDW got the license to the Harpoon franchise, it really took off.  This is by far the greatest set of supplements ever done for the system.  One drawback, though, was the game rules were tweaked with little consisitency and as a result became a bit confusing.  Still, the Harpoon series is the ULTIMATE in modern naval combat simulations.

To be honest, I can only rate the paper pencil version a '5'.  Awesome stats, sort of a living, less expensive  Janes.  OTOH, very difficult and tedious to track everything manually.  Also, Larry chooses to ignore soft factors, so all aircraft are always up, a Sidewinder always has X %age to hit, it's all very mechanical.

If you really want to play Harpoon, keep the scenario VERY small, or else get the computer version (which I played for hundred, if not thousands of hours back in the 80s/90s).

Harpoon is pretty much the standard by which modern naval wargames are measured. Only its sister games in the 'Admiralty' series really compare for the level of detail provided. I've played and enjoyed a few games, mostly just sub hunting or a couple of frigates duking it out, or fending off an attack. I've discovered that I'm getting lazy, and I don't necessarily want all that detail in a board game. These days I'd just as soon let my computer handle those things, and I'll worry myself as the captain of the ship and not the navigator, sonar, radar, weapons officer, or damage control chief. Harpoon, and its like are joining tactical air games as those where I'll let the PC do the work.

Harpoon (III was the first version i saw, owned, and played) was a well-detailed game with reasonably good mechanics.  It was a good means of modeling what the military had and how it was used.  Its achilles heal was its treatment of electronics.

I liked this enough that I became hooked on the whole Admiralty system...

I have only two real issues with the system: 

one is that that weapon X ALWAYS causes the same amount of damage if it hits.  I understand this is a simplification, but a rather unrealistic one - combat is more chaotic.

The other is that there is no competency effects - all crews perform at the same level of coptency, which was acceptible when the combatants were well-trained NATO navies vs. a well-trained Soviet Navy.  I always believed there was a competency gap, and as the system expanded to various 3rd world navies, it seemed to me that there was a competency gap that the game mechanics did not encompass.

Larry Bond clearly used this game to model the combat is some of his writing; It was most obvious (to me) in his novel of a modern Korean War.

GAME: La Bataille d'Auerstædt
RANK: 3722
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The rules are a revision of the award winning system developed by Marshal Enterprises and cover the full range of features that were characteristic of the Napoleonic battlefield. The game is therefore designed with serious gamers in mind. - Its a real tactical fight of Napoleonic Warfare!!


Check http://www.tactiquesnapoleon.com for "Tactique Napoléon" as a Spanish variant to these rules, by bringing together the best of both!

The rating is for the game series' system only with a surplus for the battle itself (for the local topic); haven't played this one yet...

...and to check for a superb video about the campaign:

My first sally into the La Bataille series. Just starting to work my way through the rules [Jan 2006].

RATING: 7
Currently playing two games of this; one F2F (as Prussian)and the other via cyberboard (as French). Using Regs XXX.

The challenges are very different to to Albuerra, my other La Bat experience to date. 

Regs XXX are a big improvement on Regs XXII

Approachable Marshall Enterprises effort. Not the greatest system, but bursting at the seams with color and good intentions. Cumbersome, with a dated command system, but still fun to play.

The initial effort by Marshal Enterprises. Could have been a little more polished but we were working out of my garage. Great artwork given the technology of the time. Remember no computers.

One of the best and smallest La Bataille battles (along with Quatres bras). Davout has to hold on dearly and fight smart in order to stave off Prussian waves. Done properly, he can later swing into attack mode. I love tactical Napoleonics, but have little time to play the larger games any longer, so this works.

Update: sold. Just no time for this stuff any longer

A more streamlined La Bataille is sorely needed to do for Napoleonic Battles what Flying Colors did for Age of Sail battles.

RATING: 6
I really like the L'B series.  This particular game has been difficult to solo due to low counter density and my own ignorance of the battle. Another one of those games that is much better with a live opponent.Counters and map are top notch.

First La Bataille game I bought. Some tricky rules but overall I love these games. Maps and counters are the best!

RATING: 7
Good: Napoleonic - Tactical - Medium / Difficult

Plus:
-Great tactical situation (mmeting engagement)
-Various tactical options for both armies
-Each army is very different in it's organization, ability, morale, tacticla doctrine and that makes it lot of fun.
-Very manageable, low counter density
-Old school and great production quality for a game from 1977
-Great gateway game into La Bataille (like Quatre Bras)

Minus:
-The rules are really a challenge and I can't play with the new Marie Louise rules as I don't know how many command points each army has....  

I like this game a bit better than La Quatre Bras as there are more tactical options for both parties. 

In the process of aquiring the games necessary to play La Bataille de Mont St. Jean, a seller offered this one for a good price. Bought it and I really love it!

RATING: 7
La Bataille Series. Recreated the romance of Tactical level Napoleonic Battles, Infantry with Column, Line, Skirmish, Square, Cavalry using charge or pursuit, Artillery fires. Each unit got their own morale rating. The best use of combined-arms-tactic in battlefield the higer chance to force enemy rout off from the battlefield. With the 4th edition cole rule added the command system and random activation, push it to a higher level of a masterwork wargame. I will give La Bataille Series Games a Rating of 8. 

La Bataille D'Auerstaedt's balance is on the victory condition. French need to defend a town near their starting location, because a single corp face nearly a whole prussian army. Don't think you got the results as Marshal Davout done in 1807 unless you got a opponent don't know what is combined-arms tactic in Infantry, Cavalry, and Artillery as Prussian did in 1806.

Yes, the graphic is beautiful,yes the map is beautiful,yes the flavour IS Napoleonic.
Yes I always doubt about which rules I have to use in the future. For the plays I made I use the standard rules.
It works not too bad and the Prussians always won.

RATING: 5.5
These games started a rule of thumb that 'Germanic' troops (Prussians, KuK, etc.) had to have their numerals shown in some sort of Fraktur font.  Wish someone would reconsider this!  Nice idea, but looks poorly.  Use something different from the French/others, sure, but ditch the faux Fraktur font.
Glad to own this; has some great features, but difficult in solitaire and hard to manage the time to make it worthwhile getting out of the box.

Great Intro to La Bataille games.  Prussians are brittle as rusted metal and will fall apart when not in line.  Davout's III Corps is a terror machine.

The only game in this series that I have actually played ftf. Beautiful components, of course. The rules system is still developing with each new entry in the series. This title came with the 3rd edition rules, where the lack of command rules is the main drawback. Still, a good game if you and your opponent play in the spirit of Napoleonic warfare. Interesting situation, a meeting engagement between Davout´s excellent but outnumbered III Corps and the 18th century style Prussian army.

At some point a tactical Napleonics guy has to dip into La Bat. With Orthez, this is recommended as a starter. Production values lag though.

This game is a nice little entry in the La Bataille series, featuring an intense one-map engagement. Both sides have ample forces with groups scattered around the maps and plenty of room for manoeuvre.

Historically this battle saw the French overwhelm an army that was significantly larger. Of significant note is that the Prussians lost their commanding officer very early in the battle and the forces fell into disarray.

The game comes with two scenario options: The battle from the very beginning of the day and the battle when the Prussian commander has just been shot and effectively removed from the battle.

This game is a tough ask for the French commander and will really bring out the true skill of the gamer if a victory is to be secured!

As close to playing 15mm Napoleonics with counters as you can get. A wonderful tactical game with some of the best looking counters of any game. Rules take some getting used to and you have to keep thinking several moves ahead to win as the French. A challenge well worth the time you put in. Hard game to find now.

Anything spared to comment upon? Maybe just this. If you are nostalgic for 3D-wargaming, then forget about random activation, chits, command phases and all such paraphernalia - in sum, disregard Richard Berg's insightful and infamous criticism over the game-system, and just play it through as straightforward as it gets with the original rule-set.

Quite to the contrary, if you peculiarly appreciate the new era of wargaming - no more omnipotent players to lead their armies, just submissive servants of Fate, then LaBat is for you.

(By the way, this title is just fine)

I have a Marshal's version. It is unpunched.traded counters. If anyone has a scan I would appreciate a file. I plan on making a set of counters so I can play it without punching it since it is unpunched, and the counters are a bit thin for these older fingers. Is it worth all the effort? It is a beautiful looking game. The map reminds me of something you might see drawn in the 6th grade by the best 6th grade artist. Pretty darn good, in other words. Looks very much like the playable Martial monster La Bataille de la Moscowa Napoleon's Battle of Borodino, 1812, perhaps the best game ever made. There aren't very many that meet that grade. An excellent game, just big. Definatly looks like a keeper. If I could find a scan I could leave the delicate counter sheet in the plastic it came in. Thank you for listing. I would be willing to trade a scan if I have something you need, mercenary dog!

This was one of the first wargames I ever played, and to this day it remains an elegant and fun system.  This is a simple, small battle compared to other La Bataille releases.

* the map is fine with little tape tabs on the 4 corners
* there are 2 copies of each organization chart. One of each is marked to designate the commanders
* one set of fire modifiers
* some 1991 errata
* two CRT/assault chart
* no standard rules; exclusive rule book is very good.Includes a download of some optional rules
* time recorder chart
* The counters are complete except for 8 blanks (These are in army colors but no unit ID or strength); also missing 7 charge markers and one undesignated French 2-10 unit. I don't know how this unit fits in. I have included a scan of the unit countersheet and marked the missing ones. They are sorted and bagged. I have not counted the bag of other markers.
* box top is worn and compressed with old tape and one side panel tear. Box bottom has old tape on it.

I found the rules (even the simplified version) to be poorly written and sorely lacking in more examples.  I especially found setup to be extremely confusing since it was hard matching everything in the setup rules with the counters.  In fact, I gave up after wasting several hours.

Ingenious solitare game

RATING: 8
Solitaire simulation of naval combat at night around Guadalcanal.The system runs the IJN ships according to some pre-programmed movement rules, but fog of war and Japanese superiority in technology means that this is a difficult system to beat. The game IS complex, but probably feels worse than it is because of the frequent rulebook checks required to run the IJN fleet. Very atmospheric and innovative. Neptune's Inferno by Hornfischer is superb alongside

The solitare engine for this game is a little hard to use, but it makes the Japanese Opponenet VERY tough!  A very challenging game, especially if you use the Articles from the Avalon Hill General to make a true campaign game.

Okay, complexity kills. 

TE, as a solo game, would easily rank an 8 or 9 in my book if not for the heavy rules, the burden of all the admin counters, and all the shuffling of data sheets and chart. BUT, every time I play this and make the investment I'm never disappointed by the result. There's an absolure uncanniness to the way the IJN side bobs and weaves its forces in TE. And the chit draw mechanism that determines if combat occurs after any given movement segment will sprout a few good hairs as you gain--and then loose--advantageous positioning. There are times you'll pray for the "combat" draw, and other times you'll beg for a blank.

Good stuff, if only because I keep coming back to it every few months for more.

My 3rd solitaire game ... never had a chance to play it ... if I recall, I had problems with the rules and it's complexity.  Too complex for a solitare game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
A good simulation of the naval events that took place near the island of Guadalcanal in 1942. The map depicts mostly sea-hexes and each counter represents a single ship. Most counters have the name of the ship that actually participated in those actions and there are even ships included for hypothetical scenarios. A dense written booklet with standard, advanced rules, scenarios and a ton of player aids complete the content of the game. The detail for movement, firing, radar sighting, torpedoes and night actions might scare away newcomers to the wargame hobby. Searching for the enemy and trying to engage him is the interesting part of the game but which ships will be left afloat after action is a big question mark. There are so many factors involved that none can predict the outcome. The game is highly historical and results are realistic.

Another classic solitaire wargame. A game I owned and briefly played in the 1980s. Has a solid reputation, especially the AI governing Japanese decisions. Looking forward to playing this again - lots of detail.

April 2013 - basic rules read and counters checked - all present and correct. I'll be giving the basic game a couple of goes over the next 3-4 weeks.

Another brilliant Jon Southard design, this time taking a look at the night gun battles off of Guadalcanal.  Key to the game is that chart that controls Japanese maneuvers: heavy ships will try to cross your T, light ships will make torpedo runs, and you will come to dread the long lance torpedoes.  However, I think the most interesting mechanic in the game is the random chit-pull for search and combat.  It makes sighting and combat fairly chaotic but, after reading histories and first-person accounts, chaotic would aptly describe these battles.  This is quite a different philosophy than just about every other naval combat game, so be forewarned.

un bon jeu en solitaire mais avec un livret de regle très (trop?) complexe. On fini par s'en lasser à cause des situations qui sont tout de même très similaires les unes aux autres. Cependant on est bien au dessus de la plupart des jeux solo habituel, et seul de poids lourds comme ambush peuvent le dépasser.

The was the solitaire game that got me into Solitaire Wargaming... but my score has no nostalgic bias.

I love this game, it really does make a good simulation of ship hunting in the Pacific war and I love playing this game.  I just recently downloaded the Campaign rules from the old AH General magazine, I can't wait to get a campaign going.  (the game was really missing a big story/mission behind the play initially, with the campaign rules the game is much more EPIC).  I love this game for the hardcore, fast and intense action, and the decision making that either mean victory or a watery grave.

I am midst of playing this with the Campaign rules in General magazine and it is brilliant and brings this game to another level.  Absolutely brilliant.  I think more fun than Silent War even.  I have increase my rate 0.5 points to reflect this.

Great game and now that I just found an old but expensive copy of Carrier! its spiritual successor I can't wait to play that too!  Love love love.  Highly recommended and totally underrated game!

Just bought on Ebay Will update when i play. Update -- just played First game. Got the hang of it pretty quickly Japanese vessels move to chase so even when I tried to escape I got shot at.  Will be difficult to beat the system.  Not as hard as some might say. Looking forward to the more complex rules.  Can see that the game could be really good with more complexity.  I used relatively simple movements to learn the game.  Nice system for ship movements and the card system for gunnery is quite neat.

Pulled this out again after years and am relearning it.  It's not really that hard to learn, but there are a lot of steps to be followed.  The game captures the feel of the battles well, torpedos are deadly and some ships will quickly find themselves sinking.  Highly recommended, and plays well both solitaire and with two players.

Solitaire wargame of the naval battles off Guadalcanal. Bought this a long time ago. Sold it a long time ago, even! I just remember being overwhelmed by fiddly, not to mention boring procedural rules. For all I know, the game might actually be a good one, it just didn't catch my fancy *at all* back then. The rating reflects that bias.

The game has a strange appeal to me although I do not own it.  It uses cards to resolve combat, something uncommon at its time and still now.  Wanted it to be a good game but the feedback of the game is not very well-received here.  What's the problem?  Perhaps the same problem as perpetuated in Jon's own Carrier can be seen here.

The best solitaire wargame I have seen (I prefer it to Carrier because the Japanese tactical display feels more natural than a dieroll and table lookup) with near unlimited replayability.  And at the same time it is by far the best game on the night battles in the Solomons - no other game shows the importance of fog of war and command control like this one.  A towering achievement.  (And no, I don't know a computer game that handles the command control aspects as well.)

Disadvantage: It is quite complex.  That's what you pay for being able to play solo.  As a ftf game it's just as much fun and much easier.  However, even in solo mode the largest battles are playable in 2-3 hours. Excellent mileage.

Had this back in the '80s, but was getting away from wargaming, and traded it. After recently reacquiring it via a kind geek marketplace seller, I have finally been able to play a few games. The advanced game is failry formidable, but so worth it. Combat is a bit abstract (i.e., no Jutland style tactical combat resolution), but the fleet maneuvering seems incredibly lifelike. Goes on my top solitaire games alongside Carrier (amazing game, by the same designer), D-Day at Omaha Beach, and the Ambush series.

If you dig complicated WWII naval actions in the Pacific, this game is for you.  Very suspenseful.  Two players can also play with a solitaire option too.  The information counters outweigh the actual game counters by almost 5 to 1 so be prepared to manage your strategies and ship units.  Needs some table top space also for the charts.

A complicated, comprehensive solitaire game of the night gunnery battles around Guadalcanal. There's a great sense of realism in the game, which is a hallmark of the best solitaire games. Two-player games can often see "gamey" or unrealistic tactics employed... here the Japanese will always maneuver in a historically accurate manner, based upon the mission they are on. They can be quite difficult to defeat. The complexity and detail make for a long game.

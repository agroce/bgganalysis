It's a stock game, that isn't (it's really a pick up and deliver efficiency game until you get to earnings). Really interesting from the perspective of getting others to push your stuff for you, but ultimately it's much more about dodging fees and operating a good company compared to the trickery you'll find in 1830. As such, the stock element feels wicked tacked on (after two attempts, I've come to realized "why bother buying anyone else's unless you honestly think they are going to do better," in which case you've lost that battle anyway), and there is the big potential for a shared incentive system in terms of cargo movement and stocks, but it just doesn't materialize in my experience. Goal cards are sort trash given how contracts come up, and how much the goals are worth. I once heard the design philosophy of "get your game set, and then start cutting until the game fails and step back just a little bit" and this design doesn't feel like that was done. The lock system and pushing is the real gem in the game and I keep coming back to it to play around with that. Ultimately, I see it as a general euro churn game though. Would play if someone needed a 4th player, but I don't think I'd ask for it anymore.

1 play / 4 players

LIKE: The system of moving boats through the locks is a great semi-cop-op mechanism. Lots of choices, potential for interesting combos. The stock mechanism was not overbearing.

DISLIKE: Fiddly, the dice can fall off the boats. Some randomness (contracts), but minor. Some potential for min/maxing and analysis paralysis. The purse for yourself or the company was difficult to remember first time through. Best only at 4 players.

OVERALL: This is a solid heavy euro, so it's good for the occasional play. I played poorly, but found the mechanisms interesting. There were contracts at the end that I needed, but didn't work out, so I feel some randomness can effect play.

My largest critique of the game is that I wanted to see more focus on the shared movement of boats, because it was so interesting. There were some rounds where little boat movement happened, which made the game feel dry and numerical.

It's a brain burner for sure and has a few quirks - feels like it could be a king maker. Hate the plastic coins and the entire board is confusing due to the odd geography of the canal. But for all that, it has an extremely nice play concept - quite smooth with actions that are fairly straight forward yet give a huge range of possibilities (thus the brain burning). Difficult to predict how to invest your money and you can make some bad moves early that are difficult to overcome. Anyhow, still really enjoyed it!

This one set the new record for the length of rules vs. actual complexity of the game ratio. It took like 60mins just to explain the basic premises of the game but once the game started everyone was surprised how simple the game actually was. Maybe it is a matter of badly written rules. I do not mean that the rules are broken, but the way the game is presented is overly complicated.

The game itself worked all right, although it did not bring that feeling of satisfaction to me. I won by a country mile, but after the game I couldn't see why. Neither could my companions analyse their efforts.

At least for me for the game to be satisfactory, you need to have some kind of an idea what happened so that you can speculate afterwards. In this, Panamax reminds me of Container, which is another game you sort of understand what is going on at the very moment but cannot really analyse the game as a whole.

Sure Panamax is an enjoyable game but nothing I personally would call great. Hence, the average rating.

RATING: 7
A very mixed bag, but largely good.  The theme is great and the pieces (except for the money) and board are good, too.  I love the pushing mechanic and the fact that there are so many different types of ships in it.  I also enjoyed the shares mechanic and the railway is a good idea too.

I would certainly play the game again quite happily, but I would not buy it.  This is because it is rather too complicated to explain.  If you play this only once with your group there is a high chance several of them would object to the length and involvement of the rules and then it would just not get played again.  None of the rules is excessively complex, but together there are just too many of them to take it all at once.  Your first play of the game is likely to take 3 hours for that reason.  With 3 hours of play you could probably choose better games.

But I do like the theme and I did enjoy it.

If suspect if this game were just slightly more elegant it could get up to an 8 or 9.

Pros:

Cons:

- random beyond control, so it's just tactical
- too big first player advantage

RATING: 7.8
There are a lot of interesting mechanics here that are good: the dice drafting (and the choice between moving or loading), the action grid on the company clipboard (and how it incentivizes taking certain contracts to gain particular bonus actions, or placing certain tokens to gain special abilities), the board set up and positioning strategy (to force other players to push you through the canal), the stock manipulation aspect.  All in all, playing this game well can certainly burn your noodle, which I love. 

The shame is really in the financial advisor cards, which are not particularly well-balanced. Unlike [i]Madeira[/i], for example, where different guild favors may appear more or less useful depending on a host of factors and the particular cost of those favors in the game, certain financial advisor cards in [i]Panamax[/i] are just so obviously better that there is far too much of a "luck of the draw" element to them.  For example, one such card gives you the face value of all of your passenger tokens at the end of the game (with each token ranging from $1 to $5), but then there is another one that gives you $5 for each of your passenger tokens at the end of the game.  There isn't any context in which the former would be better than the latter.   Similar balance issues exist with the "Offshore Accounts" card among equally skilled players.  With some tweaking, they could be perhaps re-balanced.  Others simply remove them from the game, but I do like the idea of secret goals, just not obviously imbalanced ones.

More like Panamin/max. This is a dense euro that is really a collection of simple mechanics that work well in concert and can lead to a relatively frictionless fast game IF everyone knows how to play. The teach is a steep ramp but once you are past that it's only a three round game that should take one and a half to two hours. In Panamax you are a shipping company that moves cargo on ships through the Panama Canal. The ultimate objective is to maximize your personal wealth ( you have company and personal wealth). I enjoy economic company sim games in general and this has that plus some interesting movement mechanics where you can force people to make moves That also benefit you. The only thing that grinds my gears is that the executive dice should be a different color or size from the regular ones.

I have played it only once. Not sure if I would play it again. My impression after this one game is nicely summarized in Lapsus' comments on this game:
" A rather complex and ambiguous affair with naively written rules and confused iconography which could have used more input from actual hardcore boardgamers given that this is the only plausible audience. It's also quite long (30 to 40mins per player in our experience) and flows like molasses, with cards triggering lengthy actions out of regular sequence, inability to really plan before your turn and lots of downtime. Movement actions can also be resolved in various order and quasi-infinite combinations which trigger bumping cascades and inevitably cause either light analysis paralysis or requests for hard to reset "do overs". If all of that was the price to pay for a deep, hardcore gamer game with lots of strategy then maybe it would be worth it, but that's simply not the case. There's a lot of "take that" in the end of rounds and a difference of a single insignificant dollar in a company's coffer can make the difference between a full dividends payout and a very harsh devaluation. Objectives cards can also create wild point swings and runaway leaders with little/no accountability. So Panamax is much more tactical and chaotic then one could hope from a game pretending to be serious by requiring such an investment. I think a lot of people who really like this game fail to see the forest for the trees: complexity isn't the same as depth."
Spot on Lapsus!
I won the game but there was something that specially bothered me : as indicated, a difference of a single dollar in a company's coffer in the last round can make a huge (I mean HUGE) difference! This may be triggered by other players with little control by yourself at least that you are willing to play suboptimally just to be safe.

RATING: 5
1st play: This game is the poster child for why I feel like I have to play games twice before rating them. Each time there was a mechanic or decision to make, I played it wrong. I felt stuck the entire time, and the game is too long to feel stuck for. I made a pretty big mistake on my first turn, and spent more than half of the game trying to make up for it. Repeat plays will very likely improve this game, and hopefully seeing how it plays out a second time will increase my eagerness to repeat the experience.

2nd play: I definitely understood what was going on much better in this play. Moving the ships around is fun, and finding ways to pad my own pockets is a cool dynamic. It feels like there's a lot of overhead and non-boat-pushing mechanics to work through to ultimately be able to push my boats 3-4 times over the course of the game. Managing the contracts and the stocks and the railways are all distractions from the main course. I'm not sure how much my strategy varies from game to game, and this game is brutal if you make a wrong play early. The end game bonus point cards vary wildly in value. Interesting design but not quite there for me.

[b]After 1 play[/b]:
Panamax has a original theme: transporting cargo with ships through the Panama Canal. 

Although it sounds simple: take a die, do a corresponding action, this game is a brain-burner, mostly because there many aspects that you need to take into consideration: which contract to take, how to move your ships, how to make your company financial afloat, when to buy shares etc. 

A part of this game left me with the feeling of Chicago Express, with a main difference that each players owns a company and he is responsible with his money if the company cannot pay its debts. 

A word of warning: this game is not for everybody! One player in my only game got bored halfway through it and, although he didn't "dump" the game, he lost all his interest in it. 

Another BIG minus of the game is the rulebook. Rarely I have seen a rulebook so poorly structured that it was very painful to explain the game after just reading it.

I am looking forward to a couple of more plays so that I can form a final opinion.

Fantastic economic game with agonizing decisions.  You control a company, which others can buy stock in, but you win by having the most personal money.  Tough to balance the weight of decisions to load or move to mitigate cargo fees for your company.  Interesting 'push' mechanic for ships moving through the lock system.

RATING: 6
For me Panamax is a nearly game.  It presents some interesting issues around how soon each round to switch from buying contracts and loading cargo to shipping it through the canal.  It also asks questions about how many ships you need and of what size.  A size three seems essential to grab at least one end game bonus card as a reward for making it through the canal. There are also interesting questions about who to cooperate with and how much. 

I do have a few significant reservations.  The first is the complexity of the game.  I am never going to play Panamax often enough to be able to teach it, and ploughing through the rules just takes too long.  The second is with a share market that is so dull that you wonder why it couldn't have been left out of this kitchen sink of a game.  Finally, the end game bonus cards seem unbalanced.  

Production quality is very good and the artwork is pleasing.  The rules are hard going.

This is a well designed, heavy euro, a gamers game for sure.  It has some pleasing ideas that feel fresh, including the clever use of small dice to determine the available actions each round, and other small dice to serve as cargo on ships. Ships carry dice everywhere on the board!  I like the coupling, decoupling and "pushing through the locks" ship mechanics which feel fun (like playing with ships?) and thematic.  

On the other hand, at least on the first play, the visual tractability of the two way travel in the canal (brighter dividing line or different colorations maybe?), and the ownership indicators on the ships (bigger indicators?), didn't quite come into focus for the first time players. This game separates your "company money supply" from your "personal money supply," creating a moderately interesting way to think about money in a game.  I imagine other gamers will have a greater appreciation for this "separate money" feature.

In the final analysis, if you like shipping games, money manipulation games, economic games, heavy euros, or the game Container, you should give Panamax a try.  For me, Panamax feels like a good heavy euro, but not necessarily one with warmth, fireworks or magic in its game play.  The thrill, I guess, is in the solving of the financial challenges.  Meanwhile, can I push some more ships through the canal locks?

Very interesting economic game. It has some twists that are not very common to these kind of games. The aspect of loading and moving your cargo and your ships in a way to collaborate with other players is quite interesting.

The stock metagame is another aspect that you cannot neglect along the way and understanding when is the best timing to buy seems to be key, for there are too few stocks available.

Finally, I really like the planning that needs to be done in order to put your ships on the rectangles ("eclusas") before your adversaries' ships, in order to get pushed by them. This is a really cool aspect.

I'd play this game with players that are not prone to analysis paralysis. Otherwise, it can drag on forever.

Panamax es un juego entretenido y diferente. Tiene variadas estrategias, y una muy importante es tratar de ir apovechando los barcos de los contrincantes para que con sus movimientos nos beneficiemos nosotros.
Creo le pondría mejor nota si no fuera por el dolor de cabeza que son las reglas (me costó casi 2 meses lograr leerlas - ya viene el video ;) ) y por su duración (prefiero los juegos un poco más light).

You're not likely to find a more interesting shipping game than this one centered around the Panama Canal. If this is any indicator of the designers' excellent, I'll have to grab their prior game Madeira as soon as possible. Clever dice mechanics, ability to 'piggyback' good onto other ships, an an interesting channel system which you move both player and neutral ships through. It's a heavier game, for sure, but not impossible to pick up once you get used to the action selections and the variety of what you can do out on the board, with both the physical movement of the ships and running your company board.

"Heavy" doex not equal complex in this case, but instead a certain lack of elegance. Very complicated without good reason. Runaway leader issues.

RATING: 7
Overall, this is an intriguing design that I find myself thinking about but also one where I question its replayability. See, there are two large elements in this game. (1)First, you have the logistic element of moving cargo from one side of the Panama Canal to another. But this isn't your typical rinse-and-repeat efficiency problem... delivered cargo earns your company money but not yourself money, which is how you win the game. Furthermore, this element has a very interesting abstract component where players can group/move/push ships. The (2)second element is a stock-market element, where players are able to buy shares from themselves and other players. And while this stock-element is quite limited (it's no 18xx game), the dividends that players can earn can be quite substantial. Furthermore, if a company fails to pay fees, the player owning the company is forced to pay the fee. And the other players, through moving the ships around, can manipulate the cost of those fees.

Overall, the game is more interactive and thematic than most euros... but there are a couple of things that give me pause. First and foremost, player's options for loading their cargo often can be quite limiting. And while this creates tension and requires forethought, it also depends on the luck of the draw for the contract cards. Essentially, the contract cards seem to introduce an unsavory amount of luck into a heavy/long euro. Secondly, the game manages to have mechanics that seem mechanically appropriate yet disjointed at the same time. Don't get me wrong, everything "works" in the game but it doesn't seem like there is enough time/actions for certain elements to develop equally. For instance, the stock element is quite strip down and somewhat predictable as a result.  

Still, this is a game I find quite intriguing and hoping to play more... but one where I'm hesitant to proselytize. Hopefully further plays will help solidify my understanding of it.

Finally got to play this. Was daunted initially by the classification that it is a heavy game. While the explanation did take some time, the gameplay is pretty straightforward. We still did a few mistakes.

1. Only those with the rail symbol next to the container can be loaded. - This is incorrect, you can load any container to the 1st rail track as long as there is space. It is that only those with the rail symbol had to be loaded on the rail.
2. Contracts are thought to be completed only when the goods are shipped. - This is incorrect since once the containers on the contracts are loaded, they are considered completed and a flag is taken.

I suspect this will see further expansions in terms of the types of unique ships.

Love this game. It's got a simple core choice (load cargo OR move ships) but then how you execute those actions gives the game significant depth. The economy is tight but not suffocating. There's a high amount of player interaction which I really enjoy in an otherwise Euro-style game since everyone is loading and moving each other's ships all the time. It's theme is also quite strong which is unusual for a Euro. I haven't played 2p but it's great at both 3p and 4p. It's a bit more strategic at 3p since with 4 players the extra actions means ships get moved around with more ease. I think I prefer this with 3p for that reason. The only real negative I can see is replayability being an issue since there's not much set up variability from game to game. The way the contracts come out are the main driver of variability but it's not huge. Still, there's quite a few pieces to this puzzle so it'll be a while before I get bored with it. Like with many heavier games, this is one where you have to play it once before it will click and people are competitive especially considering that early mistakes can sink you pretty easily.

RATING: 6
This is the best new game I played in 2014. I think this is one of the, if not THE example, of how to use dice in a Euro game. The way in which the ships move through the canal is brilliant and provides tons of opportunity for nasty and friendly play. The way in which players work together (or not) because of shared boats or shared ownership of a company is an economic game at its best. There is a lot to explore here and I expect I will be exploring this game more. 

I own is game now and have played it a second time.  I still really love the interaction and the mechanics of the canals.  At the same time, I'm  seeing some issues with game length and the inability to plan out turns since so much can change right before your turn.  Also, the rules overhead for how complex the game really is may be too much.  That's a lot of negative talk for a game I'm really enjoying despite the play time.  My 9 rating feels very tentative.

The 9 rating was not right... I've dropped it to a 6 simply because of the rules overhead and how fiddly the game is.  That may be a bit harsh, but I look at a game I rate a 7 as one I want to play again relatively soon.  Some much of the interaction is interesting, but I hesitated to play it again because of those issues and now, I just don't see ever wanting to seek it out again.  Maybe one day with 3 other experienced players where the game moves fast, but probably not.  The game is leaving my collection.

Interesting game, but I am not entirely sure where I am on this one.  Very well designed game (amazing what they did with just 2 actions!), as there were some tough decisions, and everything just worked very well, just not entirely sure how much "fun" I had.  The idea of "personal" vs "company" assets works well in this one, but I'm not entirely sure how long I will want to keep playing this one.  For now, I do want to try it again, and would actually like to try it at 4players.  I did VERY poorly in my first game, but this did not affect my "fun" factor.

GrandCon 2014 - One 4 player game.  I enjoyed the game and the tactical mechanics.  I felt the ending was a little flat with the end game point cards.  Maybe it was just because it was the first play without the knowledge of the rules.

I really like the subject matter, but the game seems to be a collection of relatively unrelated mechanics.  I have a hard time seeing through to what the vision of the design is, and it shows in play.

Lot's to think about after one play. The timing in this game is essential to playing well. The stocks and the market are interesting, but the mechanics feel like they restrain you rather than free you to be creative. Much like feeding your starving family in Agricola, at the end of the round you MUST pay your shareholders their dividends... or take on expensive debt. There is a lot to like in the game, but I need more plays to suss it out.

A shared incentive stock holding game makes this an automatic "8".  

Then the designers take a very clean mechanic and add in a bunch of special ships (military ships that provide additional player income, cruise ships that give special player bonuses, and a "prospector" ship that makes deliveries more valuable for companies at the cost of the owning player).  These special ships differentiate the different starting locations and, combined with the contract cards, provide some positional differentiation.  Myeh, maybe worth it, maybe not.

Then the designers add in "Financial Advisor" cards, round-end bonuses  for best performer, and special action bonuses for completing specific number of different types of contracts.  The result is a modern euro thrown over an older shared incentive game.  

If you're looking for a shared incentive game, look elsewhere.  Panamax has it, but there are better ones out there.  If you're looking for euro optimization point salad games, look elsewhere.  Panamax has it but there are better ones out there.

However, if you like both shared incentive games and euros and would like a game that combines both, this is it.  The FA cards probably should be excluded from the first several plays (gasp!  you mean I need to play it more than once?!) until players get a handle on the basic shared-incentive aspect of the game and then added back in along with the advanced variable starting price variant.  Then the game shines!  Interaction is high, player screwage (and collusion) is very present and yet there's still this underlying "secret goal" optimization that adds another level of consideration.  

For me, best game of 2014.

My wife and I absolutely love this game!

When I first put the board onto the table her eyes went wide but within 20 minutes she was pushing convoys of ships through the canal with a big smile on her face.

I enjoy the stock market, the move optimization analysis, loading cargo and most of all the money received when you reach the end of the canal.

I have to say that with the current events of the "Panama Papers" that the offshore account financial advisor card has more meaning now. :)

RATING: 9
This is one amazing and very original game and I highly recommend it.  So why haven't I given it 10 then?
Well I know that some folk have objected to it because the simulation is somewhat fuzzy when it comes to the purpose and function of the companies.  But this didn't bother us at all.  It is a game and not real life.

No, its one failing is a lack of instant clarity in the rules, with the result that I would be surprised if many groups didn't find upon checking that they were doing something wrong.  This is due to the very original nature of the game resulting in the rules failing to be intuitive.  You simply have to read them very very carefully and then read them again (plus the Reference Aid that has extra rules in it!)  Furthermore, as others have pointed out, the end of game bonus cards are so unbalanced that if you decide to play with them all a player can be made the likely winner due to the card he is dealt at game start.

My present concern is regarding the final scores, which to date have been too spread for my liking.  But with only three plays and still getting things wrong it is too early to judge.  But I'm confident we are now totally on top of it so we will have to see if something at the start of the game results in one player playing catch-up from then on, which nobody likes especially in a long game.  We frankly don't think this will be the case, but if it is I am sure we can sort it somehow.

This is a really tough game to gauge after one play.  It felt like there might be something good here, and I really like economic games, but the game felt a bit "weird" at the same time.

Basically, players are operating a shipping company, sending boats back and forth through the canals in order to make the company money. However, in 18XX style, you can invest in anyone's company, earning dividends and, at the end of the game, cashing them out at their final value.

To make this happen, players select actions, which generally consist of either loading freight, or moving ships to get the freight delivered. Of course, there's a lot more to it than that, but that's the gist of the game.

Overall, I don't know that I've played many games where I was so confused as to whether or not I really liked it.  It seems like a neat game with good stuff going on, but it also seemed kind of odd and with potentially wild disparities in scoring (one of the scoring methods, in particular, seemed like it suffered from card balance issues).  I probably have to play again to see if another play changes my opinion, but I honestly don't know if I'll get to the game again with so many games I know I like.

I am enamored with this game but I'm not sure why. Only one solo play so far to get an idea of how things work, but it didn't gel completely for me. Need to give it another try, and with people.

Oct 17 2016:
I tried it with people! I'm still enamored with it, but the pieces just don't seem to gel. I'm constantly in the rule book, which isn't organized for looking stuff up. I'd like to give this one more try, but I think I might need to find a different group to do so.

Incomprehensible rule book, and I missed some significant rules during the first game. Nonetheless, it is in fact the most interactive euro I have played (along with Wildcatters). The stock market bit is fantastic, and shunting the ships makes for great combos that you can pull off. Everything you do affects the others in the game, and yet the decisions remain as personal and economic as the best of euros. This one blew me away.

What a mess. It has the byzantine feel of a modern Euro with a kitchen sink of interrelated mechanisms layered on top of a stock holding shared incentives game.

Panamax wants to be about shared incentives and forced cooperation, but because of the random order of the contract cards (available countries), the turn order, and the way shares work you don't have a lot of agency in selecting those alliances. It seems like you are often just solving your optimization puzzle, rather than actively manipulating your opponents. 

The end-game bonus cards and the opening turn order are terribly uneven, and the rules are clunky as written. First game was ~3 hours with four, which seemed way too long for a game where what I want out of it can be had in 30 minutes from Chicago Express. Disappointing.

I've played it a couple times now, and I'm just not feeling it. It may be partially due to being terrible at the game, but all the moving parts just don't seem to achieve anything meaningful at the end. The stock manipulation seems almost tacked on and clunkly. Both games I've played the stock market was what won the game, and it seems so disconnected from the meat of the game, moving cargo as efficiently as possible through the canal, as to be its own minigame that eventually becomes the win condition out of nowhere. This is my first big disappointment from Gen Con 2014.

4/8/15: Moved up from 5 to 7. Played it again after a few months, and it's not quite as bad as my previous experiences. I think if you have players that solely manipulate the stock market, the game loses a lot of its charm. If all players are focused on moving cargo as well as using the stock market, then I think it balances out better.

An excellent economic game.  Meaty and tasty.

This game requires lots of planning, but you must be flexible to change plans based on the roll of the dice (which, although impact the game, is not a truly "randomness" to it found in other games with dice).  Planning is key, but flexibility helps.

No one strategy can win the day with this one.  A great time, and I would love to play again and again.

Played a 2 player game and it really didn't do it for me. The game seemed too loose and the decisions were not really that meaty. I hope that with more players, the lanes would get more clogged or the contention for good actions would get more stressful.  Maybe it's unfair to judge this based on just a 2 player game, but my impression is that it's not meant to be played 2 player for maximum enjoyment.

Two friends of mine talked me into playing Panamax. I had tried reading the rules, which were an absolute dumpster fire, but was then later pleasantly surprised to play the actual game.

Panamax struck me as an interesting game of shipping logistics and stocks. It played pretty smoothly, with players drafting actions from a central board to move ships or load goods.

I'd happily play again. It's a couple notches below something like Planet Steam but I enjoyed it nonetheless.

I enjoyed it but for the 3 hour length it took it was entirely too long. I imagine with multiple plays we could get this down to 2 hours or so, but at the length I'm still not convinced it's worth the multiple plays.

The ideas in this are very neat as pushing ships through the canal really makes things move and makes you think about exactly how to do it in the way to benefit you the most. I think I'm finding out I'm just not a fan of stock market games where I need to keep track of my money and my company's money. 

For whatever reason I find it difficult and can never keep straight when I get money where exactly it goes. In a game like this I feel like my personal money and my company money should be one in the same and it's not.

Fairly early thoughts.  Would be interesting if more game were present.  Has some charm.

The variance in the contract deck ordering seems both huge and explicitly unmanageable.  Enough to invalidate the game on its own.  Rather inconceivable why it was left in.

Not clear to me that there is any reasonable way to recover from bad card ordering other than to make significant sacrifices which would be both invalidated and punished if the card ordering then bent back toward the player.

A reasonable number of decisions per game (~15-17) across a reasonable number of options per turn (well within the rule of 7) except that more than half of them on any given player’s turn are clearly uninteresting/unreasonable.  Parsing problems are frequently presented as if they were decisions (~third of turns?) and they are not, and many of the remaining decisions are rather weak.

Fair bit of continuous overhead in re-re-parsing the game state on each player’s turn.  Not a terrible thing, just surprising given the general cleanliness of the design.

Presents as extremely tactical.  Not sure that is true, but it seems that way.  For instance I suspect there is a viable strategy which focuses on simply shuttling the 1-ships back and forth as quickly as possible.  There are similar choices around the big ship, and another around not bothering to dividend in one of the scoring rounds and instead simply getting all your dice ~cheaply at sea with the plan of hammering them home in the next epoch.  Ehh, timing games mixed up with yet more mechanical parsing problems masquerading as games.

So many choices seem intimately dependent on the uncontrollable/unpredictable contract deck ordering, pushing the game back to pure tactical.

The bonus scoring cards are needlessly opaque and overly lumpy/uneven.  There's a bit of early commitment to them, which is fine, but mostly they're just another parsing problem masquerading as a game.  They don't add enough game value.

In short: almost interesting but for being fatally under-developed.  As a result ends up a bit light/fluffy except for the onerous parsing overhead.

Rating likely to fall 0.5-1.0.

Update: I find Panamax curiously inchoate.  It seems fairly easy to enumerate all the decision points in the game, and the problems enter in the evaluation of those decisions.  Many of the decisions are manifestly false, leaving on the order of 6-8 actual decisions per game.  While a few of those decisions are clearly strategic (eg par price, timing of buying additional ships, stylistic shipping patterns) the rest are markedly tactical and on tiny (generally sub-single turn) time scales (eg individual ship movements) -- which leaves the game seeming sort of stretched and thin in the middle: big sweeping strategic decisions and tiny tactical decisions, and not so many of either.

Updated:  Not a [i]Bad Game[/i].  Not an [i]interesting game[/i].  My beefs (descending order):

- A dominatingly high rate of pure parsing problems aka False Decisions masquerading as actual decisions (almost half of all seeming decisions).

- Primarily tactical.

- Random factors (eg contract card draw orders) and otherwise trivial player prediction errors throughout the game will produce significant final score swings (the back of my head says up to ~15% for each event of either/both types). 

- Both positional control/prediction and final scores are rather swingy and seemingly capricious as big lumps of windfall and penalty ~randomly fall into player's laps (randomness and precise player prediction errors).

There is a lot going on here that I like.  I really like the pushing mechanic to devise the best way to navigate the canals.  It helps create a semi-cooperative atmosphere that is typically tough to realize in practice in 2-player games.  Money can be tight, and requires planning.  I think the stock rules for non-payment are great, and gives players the opportunity to be sneaky and clever by artificially inflating stock values.

We play without the secret objective goals.  I don;t see how that would add to my enjoyment of the game.

Overly long, even with fast players. Very bad rulebook, easily in the top ten of the worst rulebooks I've ever read. 

The dice "jump" mechanic is a joke and improper for a strategy game. Planning is not possible, if you find a suitable dice at the start of your turn - fine. If not, you're kicked.

Easy way to win: Take a directory action early in the first round and push your share price up. Then disallow anyone else to do so by dragging the directory dice away everytime it is your turn. You not only get bigger amounts of cash infusion in your firm when shares get bought. You're also set to win the directory bonus chit every round!

Neat Euro game for shipping back and forth through the Panama Canal.  I like the dynamics of the game and Panamax gives you a good flavor of getting ships in que to transit the canal.  Game play keeps you thinking.  The dice are really just to set up each turn, so there isn't much of any dice luck factor in the game. This is also a novel game design unlike any other Euro I own.  Quite innovative. Glad to have in my extensive game collection and look forward to many plays of this game.

This game is a little heavier. You are trying to manage your company, make more money, ship a bunch of goods and try not to get allot of port fees. I liked the theme of the game with all of the different ships moving around and pushing (forcing ships in from of you to move). Unfortunately there seems to be an end game scoring card that is unbalanced and should be removed from the game. Otherwise this is a solid game that I enjoyed but properly won't make the collection.

In Panamax each player manages a shipping company established in the Colón Free Trade Zone. Companies accept contracts from both US coasts, China and Europe and deliver cargo in order to make money, attract investment and pay dividends. At the same time the players accumulate their own stock investments and try to make as much money as possible in an effort to have the largest personal fortune and win the game.

Would seriously considering purchasing if not for the terrible cover. The first (prototype) cover was incredible.  

A very fun game of logistics. Can be a little too nasty (and too tight) at times, but otherwise a fine game. Excellent graphic presentation of the board though.

I enjoy the theme in particular, and it's nice to see something that hasn't yet been done in a strategy boardgame. The way the movement works is unique, in that ships "push" or "pull" other ships through the canal, and the way players are incentivized to move the various region's military ships is interesting as well. 

Some of the scoring cards are clearly weaker than others, and this bothers me a little bit. I also think it's easy for a company to fall short of being able to pay dividends, and this is catastrophic in this game. 

Rules clarifications not evident from the rulebook:
-Cannot use a Captain card obtained at end of last game turn, as you don't have a turn.
-Moving military ship using Captain card and for bonus Move action on clipboard considered separate from player's action, so DO get paid for moving military ship. So, it's possible to be paid up to 3 times on one's turn for moving military ships.

Not a bad game, but too many moving parts for a multiplayer game that make it too difficult for me to form anything resembling a coherent strategy. The result is little more than reactionary tactics based on available actions. It's clear you want to diversify your loads, but if the ship cards don't fall right, sucks to be you.

I do like the shares and investment aspect, though it does feel a bit bolted on. The way you can move the ships around is kinda neat.

But, just not for me.

I've had this game for quite a while before finally pulling it out ... and glad I finally did. Panamax has a lot of mechanics that I love in a game all tied together in that every decision effects everything else. 

It's largely an economic game, but also has a bit of programming, pick-up-and-deliver and even some area control (or rather area positioning). The latter is one of the more unique mechanics I've seen that works wonderfully with the theme as ships push each other through the Panama Canal. If you can time everything right, and predict what other players are going to do,  you can get them to do a lot of your movement without having to spend extra actions/turns -- which are at a premium in Pamamax with only three rounds of four turns each, so 12 total turns in the game.

That creates great interaction -- and some negotiation -- without too much "take that," although there are times you can be mean by moving other people's ships.

This game is all about efficiency, especially with your company funds and movement. Looking forward to exploring it more.

The best acolade I can give this game is that it fits a compelling and complex looking economic simulation into less than 2 hours and doesn't feel like its cutting corners doing it. The worst is that the rule book is a bit poor, for some reason it will explain exceptions and restrictions on a rule for something like loading cargo before giving a good explanation of what loading cargo actually involves.

I'd quite like to play this again, but i suspect i might end up not liking it. It is not worker placement, but you do take actions from a limited pool, and other players can deprive you of an interesting decision. However this is probably 18xx or age of steam for the modern gamer. Its easier to play, shorter and slightly more forgiving but it still has that hard edge. It doesn't quite convince me I'm in business as much as 18xx does though.

An interesting game.  Despite the simple rules, there's a LOT of AP when moving ships is involved.  Pushing dice around is satisfying, the stock system is interesting, but the end-game bonus cards are disappointing.  It's one of those games where the cards were purposefully made unbalanced so the players would have to balance everything themselves.

Panamax is clearly my Game of the Year 2014 and looks like one of my all-time favorites, perhaps #1. That’s a big claim, but that’s how much of a hold the game has on me. I find it so opaque and yet so freshly exciting every time I play. Took me a while to figure out what I think this game does so well, and I think it boils down to: What vs How vs What-and-How.

Some games tell you what to do but not how. A recent example is Madeira with end-of-turn VP tiles that you must satisfy in order to score VPs. The challenge is figuring out how to do what you already know you need to do. Other games, like Vinhos, tell you how but not what in that you are told how to make the wines but not what to do with them once you do (Do you sell them for money? sell them for VPs? take them to the wine fair?). 

And in Panamax, it occurs to me that the game is asking me both What and How at the same time. What do I want to do is not obvious beyond ... take dicey things and ... get them ... across board? Nor is How: by using ... boaty things? Well, which boats of yours then, and where? It's not that easy to fill your own boats with cargo so sharing cargo with other players (yours on theirs, theirs on yours) is not an obvious answer to anything either. That each of your boat types confers a different type of bonus card yet is easier/harder to get across the board provokes tough questions. And whose stock should you purchase if you want to get a payout this turn? 

There are no obvious paths like in other games to tell you what at least one of your foci should be. A frequent refrain of new players is “how do I score points again?” because you’re running a company separate from your own personal cash (i.e., VPs). Going it alone via loading your own dice on your own boats and moving them yourself is a low-odds way to win the game, so you have to find avenues to cross-incentive that work out better for you than your opponents. The dice and the contracts introduce just enough randomness to provide some friction as you try to accomplish your goals in a way reminiscent of Brass (another favorite of mine). 

The game branches from here, but the point is, you're asked to do a lot more of the heavy lifting in terms of finding your own way to make points, and it feels wide open as a result. The payoff is a game that feels more challenging and more repeatably fresh than any in recent memory.

***Rules Clarifications***
- you can decline a flag choice from the Rail table
- you may choose to select a flag and decline the Free action
- if you choose a flag and execute the Free action you must fully complete the Free Action (e.g., 3 moves exactly)
- No, if a container does not have any rail icon at all then it CANNOT be loaded onto the rail table.

Update: I even enjoy this game solitaire; just amazing!

P11/2013 Still in prototype, but one of coolest new designs.

Post Essen '13 - First played this at Metatopia as a test for Stronghhold. Loved it.

BGG.con '13 - Took a prototype to the con, played it, collected feedback, relayed to the designers

2014 - asked by Stronghold to take the role of Developer for Panamax working directly with the Design team. 

Yes, I still love the game, the designers (Gil, Nuno and Paulo) are phenomenal collaborative creators.

This is a hard game for me to like.  It's an incoherent mess, mechanism-wise.  It induces analysis paralysis and is a lot more work than it's worth.  Of course, this is subjective and I'm sure there will be many people who like it.

I thought I'd like this more with 4 than 3, but when we finally had the right players it just lasted longer and had the same problems. Player order can really screw people and leave them shut out of things.  The concentration of different country contracts can really leave one player out if they end up the only one going the other way.  And end-game bonuses don't seem balanced at all.  Maybe we were doing something wrong, but none of us had any interest in trying it again after the last play.

Interesting change of pace with the theme, shipping through the Panama canal.

I liked this one primarily due to the theme, but the mechanics all worked well together and there was a lot of tension that last round to see who could pay out dividends or not.

Would definitely play this again.  Best with 4 as there is more shipping and pushing, with more use of other players' ships.  Not as good with fewer players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
My opinion, after just 2 games, is that, apart from the choice of the initial contract card, the rest of the game is quite scripted and plays by itself.

I feel the choice of the first contract card (during setup) is the most important in the whole game. 

After that, you can load cargo only where contracts let you do it and where there are ships available;
if you have the chance to buy a stock, you should, and of the company that is most probable of paying its dividends at the end of the round;
you should always move ships with your cargo, trying to fit the in positions where other players will push them, and in the last round, move opponent ships (without your cargo) in a way to drop their income (unless you have invested in them).

Everything seemed to me quite obvious, even when I had to let my company default (i.e. not pay its dividends) at the end of a round not to advantage my opponent who had invested too much in it.

I hope that in future plays I will be able to change my mind.

After the discussions I had read about Panamax before playing it for the first time I was expecting quite a rules-laden economic game, and the mechanism overload in the designers' previous work, Madeira, probably further contributed to that expectation.

I was pleasantly surprised that the game I found instead (after slogging through the somewhat obtuse rulebook) was a highly interactive, medium-weight economic game. At least that last part held true. Once you can leave the rulebook behind the game actually flows pretty nicely, and the inherent complexity is mostly a result of the player interactions, not an artifact of the rules corset.

Some of the game's graphic design and iconography is less than ideal and I have a few reservations about the contract cards being balanced but other than that this is easily my favourite game to come out of Essen 2014 so far.

PANAMAX ist ein sehr thematisches Spiel, das den kommerziellen Schiffsverkehr durch den Panamakanal abbildet. In der Summe seiner thematisch bedingten Mechanismen und Ideen das Spiel seinen eigenen Charakter und eine Individualität. So ist z.B. die Bewegung der Schiffe diesem thematischen Umstand in diesem mittelökonomischen Euro-Wirtschaftsspiel geschuldet. Dabei merkt man PANAMAX seine Herkunft an: Kleinverlag, Autorenteam, Entwicklungszeit - mit allen unvollkommenen Ecken und Kanten und einem Spielbrettdesign aus den 80ern. PANAMAX hat seine Sperrigkeiten und keine gute Gebrauchsgrafik. Mehr professioneller Feinschliff hätte aus diesem Rohdiamanten womöglich ein Schmuckstück gemacht. PANAMAX hat seine Verweildauer, seine Rätsel und seine Frage nach Zukunftstauglichkeit, die es aus der Rolle des Liebhaberspiels wohl nicht entlassen ist. Leider lässt die unterirdische Regel auch einige Fragen offen und unbeantwortet. Man kann PANAMAX in seiner ganzen Kantigkeit durchaus als verpasste Chance betrachten. PANAMAX ist ein seltsamer Außenseiter in der taktisch-strategischen Spieleklasse, den man liebt oder der einen befremdet zurücklässt.

Clever pick-up and deliver game with lots of co-opetition due to interconnectivity of ship, cargo loading limitations, ship movement and the stock market.

One of the most interesting Euros I've played.  I really like how much player interaction there is mixed with an economic layer over top.  The economic layer and stock market doesn't overpowering the main canal/shipping mechanic and makes for a very enjoyable game.  It doesn't feel as nearly as heavy after a play or two, since there are really only two main action mechanics.  Everything else is just detail around the edges.

Love it and we constantly want to play more.

This game is a gem. I find the mechanics very innovative and I love the co-dependencies and incentives the ships create. The boat pushing, the stock manipulation. I would give it a higher rating if you could manipulate other people's stock value to mess with the share payout but that would make it a lot nastier and I don't know if it would upset the design too much.  

People complain about the unbalance of the bonus point cards but you can always choose which ones to take and which ones to pursue, so for me it's a minor issue.

In a perfect world, I would get to play Panamax at least several times a month. I'm very happy to have picked it up and greatly enjoy every aspect of it. The game is tough, not mechanically, but rather from a strategic standpoint as you really have to be able to figure out your opponents and how to make for yourself from their actions. Incredible, solid game that I could play 100 times and still not have it be enough.

--
Sadly, lowering the score here from 10 to 9 because the player count issue isn't something I can easily reconcile. Most recently I played with 3 and we couldn't shake the feeling that there simply didn't feel like we had enough moves on each turn to do enough. If we had one more player the game would have been far more dynamic, I believe, but at 3 players, we couldn't help but feel that it would have been far better with a 4th. Unfortunately, as the game is difficult (for me) to easily teach, it's hard to find 3 other people at board game night willing to take the time to sit through the explanation, then sit even longer through the full game.

Did not find the rules intuitive or elegant, and there was more chaos in the card draws than you'd expect.  For example, the shipping broke down initially with 3 players cooperating on one side, and a lone person on the other in our 4 player game.  The 1 guy was appeared to be at a significant disadvantage.  My impression was it's an ok mid weight euro that uses the theme well.

Dice seem unnecessary and fiddly.  I love Stephan Feld games where actions are balanced and the dice are smartly used and all the fiddly-ness of the game feels gratifying.  The dice don't do anything here really.  Just a ploy to sell to us players who love them.  Shame on them.  There could have been many streamlined ways to handle the loading and movement choices.(Like Resources in City of Iron, for example) Could have had cargo cards that are the ships themselves. Game feels less than fully developed.  Not balanced and the real surprise is that it doesn't feel like your accomplishing anything and the bottom line is it isn't fun.

Someone please offer me a fair trade for it and give this mint game with separate plastic containers(One for each player and for each type of general game piece) a home where it can be loved.  I am sure we just don't get it as many do.

Great strategy game with a lot going on. It's a very fun but complex game. A must have for players that love medium-heavy strategy games with lots of moving parts.

In Panamax every player is an investor controlling one transport company. You can pick up and fill in contracts that will cross the Panama Canal, to accomplish those contracts you may use your companies ships or any other available ships. 
Aside from normal cargo ships there's also passenger and battle ships, giving you different bonuses.

There's many things to do and many different options to take. Among others, you can buy stocks in any company, regardless of those being yours or not.
Players can do whatever they want, if they want to go for passengers they can, over invest in stocks sure, anything is possible as there is no right strategy to win and anything can work. 

Your goal is to make as much money as possible as investor, it doesn't matter if you're company is successful or not, however you need to keep it afloat in order not to get in debt to pay off the companies expenses.

This game provides you with tough decisions and some opportunities to both be mean and engage in a little coopetition. I like the "pushing" element of the game as well as having to spend all the movement actions, whether on your own ships or others.

Some things that irked me: 1) The board design is all backwards and they didn't need to make it confusing by having US West and US East, especially with the images so small; 2) On a related issue, figuring out who was paid by/pays the company and who was paid by/pays the player was very confusing; 3) There are also seemingly few opportunities both in gameplay and b/c of money to buy shares in other companies; and 4) Money is brutal in this game and it's hard to come away without tanking your company or your private funds at least once.

Things to consider in the future: I wonder if this game wouldn't get a little samey after a while. Especially because there are only three rounds and it's damn near impossible to get a ship from one side to the other in a singe round.

Weight: medium- heavy
Players: 4
Length: 2 hours, probably a bit more
Opinion: the game seems harder in rules at the beginning, but you know how it flows after a couple of actions. Everything goes smoothly in the game, the them is really well integrated.
I love all the mechanics, you have dice as cargo for your company, but there is no luck as you do not roll any of them. The actions with dice is a well system, although you roll them to set the available actions for that round, you have many flexibility.
Regarding the flow, you have lot of interaction, you cannot win alone, you need other players to use your ships, as well as you need others ships to load your dice. And think wisely in which Company you invest, as you can do it for your own purpose or for annoying the opponent.
And all said out there about the cards, did not find them unbalanced. They help you a lot for your final points, but you can go ahead and win without them (the winner just made 4 points with only one card, the second player only had one card, and the rest had 2 financial cards)

Panamax is a heavy euro with a strong theme.  The way you move cargo on boats is unique.
I like that you can load and move any player's boat.  You can also force the other players to move your cargo by blocking the canal with a boat.
This game is very good with 3 or 4 player but I would play something else with 2 because you'll lose most of the player interaction which make this game shine.

I'm not a huge fan of Euros (though this type of meaty middle weight Euro is probably my favorite), but I did really enjoy my play of this.  In essence, it's pick-up-and-deliver with some economic considerations.  But I particularly enjoyed the movement/pushing methods and that aspect of the game in tandem with trying to fulfill the contracts and delivering goods efficiently.

I can see this being an instabuy... not for me, but for several of the Euro-geeks in my game group.  I think it will be right up their alley, and I will want to play this again when they have it.

Very heavy game about optimizing logistic operations (aka shipping goods through the Panama canal).  Hard and unforgiving gameplay with steep learning curve.  Every action is critical, there are no mechanisms to slow down the leader and no mechanisms to speed up those who trail behind.  Will take at least 3-4 games to learn how to avoid at least the most dangerous mistakes.  You'll need a group who is willing to invest a lot of time. Having that said that I still find the game strangely fascinating.

Really well-designed game that has an excellent mixture of limited-supply actions and methods of making actions mutually beneficial for multiple players. The stock actions in it are important score-wise but it's not really a "stock game" per-se. Good with 3 but seems like it would be best with 4. Mechanics seem like they wouldn't be very interesting with just two so I wouldn't recommend it for that.

The game is a good design in its core, and I really like the theme and ship movement mechanic. The board is good looking and all bits works really well.

On the other hand, there are many small rules to keep track of: Max one Captain and Stevedore card, otherwise you must take money, but Finacial Advisor you can have as many as you get, but only score two in the end game, max two contracts at any one time etc etc... And the game really don´t remind you of all these "special cases" that are in there in the rulebook. 

Also, the scoring for the Financial Advisor cards at the end of the game is really cryptic... Rules not very clear on this.

And finally, the two main reasons I dont really fancy this game:
1. Too long for what it is, and even if you don´t feel like there is much luck in the game, getting the right contracts served in front of you that fits with where your boats are can really help you... or vice versa, you desperatly need a contract for China, but it doesn´t come up, or someone takes it just before you. Sure there are the backs on the cards with generic freight, but those are always value 3, which means they are too high value for passenger ships, and low enough to often not get your size two or three ships sailing.
2. Screwage! You can REALLY mess with other players plans by putting their dice in expensive zones, and often there is nothing the other guy can do about it. I can really see this get out of hand in some groups.

Final Verdict: Not a keeper for me! Too complex and punishing with too many small exeptions to remember. Too long (both games I played rougly 3 hours+rules=4 hours. Endgame scoring (finacial Adv.) is strange and badly explained in the rules. How many tokens scores? only 3 or all?

I can see other liking this game, but ultimatly not for me..

Panamax is a fiscal game, with dice allocation for actions, based on maritime shipping through one of the busiest waterways in the world.

It has lots of Euro actions, such as moving workers to different areas for cost reduction, completing trips for rewards, allocation for player order determination, contact completion for political benefits, and bonus action spaces.

And yet with all that, this is a bottom level fiscal game. This one reminds me of a Winsome game, only prettier :).

'If I push this here, will I save enough in Fees to pay dividends at round end?' 

'I I push them there, will they no longer be able to make dividends?'

'Crud; how can I get those dice out of the warehouse before it breaks my bank?'

'If I load this die on his ship, will they just leave it there in the lake, or maybe move it somewhere more expensive?'

'If I buy a stock from them (or even adjust their value up) will they no longer be able to pay Dividends on top of Cargo fees? Or should I reinvest my company before they do, so I do make Dividends?'  

There are delicious min-max money questions all the time, with only 12 actions for the entire game (before bonuses), make this a very thinky money-focused game, which is not one expects when you roll dice and put them on board ships for a journey.

But this game will defy some expectations, and may surprise others very pleasantly.

It's clearly pretty well thought out- I've had one game where a Financial Advisor seemed overpowered, but if that keeps up all I have to do is put that one back in the box if drawn, or maybe even make the Financial Advisor cards open- if you know what an opponent is planning it's easier to circumvent after all.

Most of my games have been tough and thinky, and not that far apart in scoring, so perhaps it was a fluke.

In any case, this is a sharp financial game, and has a lot to think about during your rounds.

Panamax-only just small enough to fit through the canal locks, and packing a lot of game in this box.

It's a "Push your lock game" :P

Very good mechanics, very tough economy - it can be going so well one year and then crash the next because you can't cycle your dice fast enough.

It's a share game so I do wish there was more incentive to work together... the pushing mechanic kinda does this but without the intensity or pressure that I feel a share game needs. Hence you always just reinvest in yourself.

Otherwise great game :D

Sometimes you see a run of cards that you can really benefit from, and sometimes you have to make small plays so you don't miss a big one.  There is a lot of linear interactions that may turn players off.

This wasn't played with all the rules followed correctly, so I don't have an entirely whole impression of the game.

That said, I would not play this again. There is some interesting stuff with the ship movement, but it's all wrapped up in fiddly, little mechanics all over the place. Long and boring.

A game that's by no means as interesting as its preamble sounds. There are elements of 18xx here: personal and company money, shareholding, dividends, but some semi co-op aspects too such as loading cargo onto others' ships and 'pushing' other ships through the locks. The end result is just massively frustrating, there is possibly the germ of a genuine classic here and more development might have revealed it, instead we have a collection of vaguely related mechanisms that feel unsatisfying and go on far too long. The fact that BGG can be so excited by such a ragbag game just makes me sigh for the days of Knizia, Kramer and the like.

RATING: 8
Interesting.  There are a lot of rules to absorb upfront, but the core of the game is relatively simple.  A lot of it is about planning out how the boats are going to move. I really like the fact that you have lots of boats to choose from, including yours and the neutral ones.  A lot of the game seems to be about losing money as slowly as possible.  The shares seemed weirdly irrelevant. (1 play)

Ambientato nel mondo dei trasporti marittimi del canale di Panama, non si può dire che sia brutto, ma sicuramente non scorre via leggero. Pochi turni e molte meccaniche complicate, difficili da gestire e controllare: due elementi che tendono a favorire il ragionamento prolungato ed a bloccare l'azione. Sicuramente non adattato ai tornei.

Buen juego del grupete de portugueses que empezó a darse a conocer con este título, Madeira, Nippon y los que le seguirán.

Muy en la línea de juegos que me gustan. Euro de gestión de recursos, en este caso con una mecánica simpática de selección de acciones, ya que no están siempre disponibles. Se tiran unos dados al principio del turno y en función de su número marcan que acciones y en qué cantidad estarán disponibles. Luego los jugadores cuando realizan la acción retiran uno de sus dados. Simple pero se adapta muy bien a las acciones a realizar, cargar barcos y moverlos por el canal principalmente.

Tiene un par de vueltas de tuerca para hacer el juego un poco más desafiante. Una de ellas es la inclusión de las acciones de las compañías. Tu ganas con el dinero que tengas al final, pero necesitas que tu compañía funcione bien para poder pagar dividendos y que no cueste dinero a ti. Además, puedes comprar o ser comprado por otros jugadores por lo que conviene estar ojo avizor por si alguien lo está haciendo mejor que tu.

Juego de un par de horas de duración que cada partida me va gustando más y acercando su puntuación al "ogro" del Madeira

RATING: 8
I really liked the way you could unlock special bonuses on your board and how that should affect which contracts you go for. I love the way the pushing works and how with clever play you can set your stuff up to get free pushes, and how sometimes you're forced to help someone else and you need to figure out who to help. And in fact sometimes in progressing people's goods toward being delivered you'll cost their company extra money, and if you're particularly good this can prevent their company from paying out. There's a lot of really smart and interesting stuff there, it's sort of like Brass in how you need to know when you can get away with helping people and how to get them to help you.

That said though honestly I feel like the whole stock aspect didn't really add much for me. Maybe with more plays we'd more aggressively buy each others' shares and then that whole aspect of helping some other companies so you can get a payout would be much more interesting but I've yet to see that really. It seems perfectly viable to just only ever buy your own stock.

And the weakest thing I think is the action selection. It felt pretty rare for there to be any actual decisions to make in terms of what die to pick on a given turn, and what difficulty there was there vanished once I'd filled out my first row and got the power to be able to move dice across the board for free. But this is a minor enough thing that I can still really enjoy the game even if the dice drafting aspect itself is pretty weak, the rest of the game is great.

Very interesting game, not played another quite like it. On the surface it feels like it's finely tuned, and well balanced, and once you understand the game it's very simple and everything seems to fit together nicely.

Most of the game is great, lots of interesting decisions, but the Financial Advisor cards are not well balanced at all, with two obvious examples:

1) one of the passenger cards is clearly better than the other
2) the card that adds your companies money to your personal money at the end of the game has the potential to be far stronger than any other card.

Also being able to move any ship, even one that you don't have cargo in opens up a huge potential for screwing other players.

This is also one of those games where 1 mistake, or someone else moving your ship into a higher upkeep area, can cause your company to not be able to pay out dividends 1 round, which can mean you go from being in contention for the win, to last place.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Panamax is a solid economic game with the unique spin of being able to invest in how well players are managing their companies. The core mechanics are mostly straightforward (some of the ship movement can be awkward) and compelling. The biggest drawback to the game is that it can become a very lopsided affair with inexperienced players either intentionally or accidentally causing headaches for others. It's also a game that is clearly designed for four players, limiting its appeal. However, if you have a regular group that prefers more complex games, Panamax is absolutely worth a look.

Initial Rating: 6.5 (February 2014)

After the megahit that was Madeira (game of the year for me), I was keen on trying their next game, so I had a very high expectation. After playing Panamax I’m a bit disappointed, but I still think Panamax is an ok to good game.

The rules aren´t that hard but the game offers interesting decisions (which dice to pick, which ship to move, which ship to load, what contract to pick), still the game is a lot lighter than Madeira. There is an interesting shared incentive mechanism at play in Panamax (shared loads, shares from a company that will pay dividends to its investors each turn, shared ship movement in certain locations) but it wasn’t very exciting for me. I really liked that you have to manage a business but the objective is to have the most personal money. The decisions are limited to 4 per turn, so it is a tight game. I like that. 

The theme does nothing for me and the components are good enough although the color/kind of the vessels is hard to see when they are loaded. The art is very good.

I feel that the game is mainly tactical (reactionary) because you don’t know what dice will appear, so it has a high degree of luck. Our scores were very close but at the end some players could not perform well because the needed dice didn’t appear. Another big concern is that I feel the end of game bonuses are unbalanced and it is pure luck if you get the right one.

Bottom line, I like the game but it is no longer a must have for me. It is a good pick up and deliver game with some interesting bits thrown in, sadly it also has more uncontrollable luck that I want in a game of this length and weight. Perhaps the rating will improve with more plays but I don’t have a burning desire to play Panamax again soon.

Current Rating: 6.5

2017-07-10 - Panamax is a really interesting dice drafting, logistics game. The way ship movement works is very cool, and makes for some fun opportunities for player interaction.

Played Oct 2014

A heavier game that flows extremely well once you get going. Has some very neat positive player interaction as you can load your goods onto opponents' ships, and you can move each others ships as well (which does also allow for some negative interaction, but mostly it's a good thing). The ship movement makes the game and is extremely thematic. Can't wait to play this one more! I do have some concern about the relative strengths of the end game scoring cards... we'll see how that pans out.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Action selection with a dash of 18xx thrown in. Understanding the consequences of this 18xx inspired part of investing in shipping companies, dividend payments and share price development helps but it's not a game of manipulating the market. People looking out for this will be disappointed.
More relevant are the decisions - either negotiated or not - to cooperate in loading and moving ships to speed up deliveries. Eurogamers will want to avoid any explicit negotiations. Timing the bonus actions right can be decisive as well.
A few small-publisher edges irritate me, notably the too easily achievable ability to move action cubes from one section to the other without cost and the income gained from military ship movement. The ability to move the action cubes without cost almost completely eliminates any pressure in the action selection part. The investor cards are probably a bit too unbalanced (effects in one game were between 8 and 27 VP's for single cards with a winning score of 113 VP's).

I knew I would like this game when I learned about it in the spring, and it does not disappoint. Like Power Grid, there are so many things going on but it all makes thematic sense, for the most part. I like the dice element and while it's not at all a dicefest, I know that could turn some people off. I say give the game a chance. The luck of the dice is not that big a deal, especially towards round three. It's amazing how close our first game was: 62-62-63. We each imagined there was a runaway winner, and none of us was sure who it was. That means it's a great game!

The game is very slow and AP-prone. While the pushing mechanisms are interesting, the fact is that there is a large discrepancy between what you do all game (managing your company) and what you win for (most personal money). And in the realms of stock-management games, this is an average one.

Oh man, do I love the theme on this one! I saw an after market expansion for ships to put the die on (awesome) and watched a Rahdo runthrough of it and I think this is about the heaviest game I'm interested in (maybe Shipyard is heavier). I don't know if my SO would be interested, but I hope that we can build to that. Will look at getting this in the distant future.

A rather complex and ambiguous affair with naively written rules and confused iconography which could have used more input from actual hardcore boardgamers given that this is the only plausible audience.  It's also quite long (30 to 40mins per player in our experience) and flows like molasses, with cards triggering lengthy actions out of regular sequence, inability to really plan before your turn and lots of downtime.  Movement actions can also be resolved in various order and quasi-infinite combinations which trigger bumping cascades and inevitably cause either light analysis paralysis or requests for hard to reset "do overs".  If all of that was the price to pay for a deep, hardcore gamer game with lots of strategy then maybe it would be worth it, but that's simply not the case.  There's a lot of "take that" in the end of rounds and a difference of a single insignificant dollar in a company's coffer can make the difference between a full dividends payout and a very harsh devaluation.  Objectives cards can also create wild point swings and runaway leaders with little/no accountability.  So Panamax is much more tactical and chaotic then one could hope from a game pretending to be serious by requiring such an investment.  I think a lot of people who really like this game fail to see the forest for the trees: complexity isn't the same as depth.  I need to play this more, but it seems hard to pick this over Vinhos, Madeira or even Die Macher when there is both time and will to get into something this involved.

Hard to get to the table so I sold the game. I'm still happy to play, but don't need to own. 

FIRST IMPRESSION:

There's a fair bit to like here with each company having five shares, their own treasury and each person having their own money.  Similar to Wabash Cannonball, a company can only use their money to expand and develop but unlike WC if a shortfall occurs in maintenance fees, the difference must be made up by personal cash.  There is quite a bit of room for cut-throat/nasty play if desired. There's also a lot space to explore despite ever only choosing between two types of actions on your turn!

Brilliant but fiddly heavy Euro game.  There are a lot of moving parts, teaching the rules takes a while and each turn can bog down with analysis.  That said the gameplay seems to offer depth as well as cleverness and complex interactions.  I like the strong integration of theme (for a game of its genre) into the game here. Some of the investor bonus cards seem a little overpowered from my limited play.

I think the idea is a good one. Moving containers moving ships scoring points. I think where it draws short is that the designer is trying to place too many different mechanics into one game, stock ownership, turn order variants, card bidding etc. The cards are also very unbalanced and it was felt that the first player has a huge advantage in game. It feels like the game may have been rushed to market in time for a Convention. Good game but doubtful if it will hit that table again with so many other good games out there.

This is a deep, heavy game about shipping.  This game is tricky because you have personal money and your "company" has money...and you don't want to run low on either!  I lost this game the only time I've played it all the way through because I pretty much completely ignored the investment track and buying and selling stocks.  There's a lot of game here.

The game has an 18XX feel but has very different mechanics.  18XX ought to have non-train themes and still be fun.  This really does deliver on it.  You own a company that is trying to move ships through the Panama canal.  If you load your ships and move to the other side of the Canal you make your company money.  You as an investor can invest in your company of other players's companies.  I found the game to be brilliant.  It played in a reasonable amount of time and gave a very 18XX feel.  

The only downside is that this game is really only for 4 players.  It can work at 3 players but it is not great.  Two players really does not work well.

You cannot plan much in advance since other players tend to push your ships to "kingdom come". The action selection mechanism was nice, and the game had a good "flow" but I found it a bit too chaotic for its length.

Downgraded after second play. Randomly distributed scoring cards, randomly drawn loading cards, random selection of actions (which can benefit some players while harming others, randomly). This is not my type of game!

RATING: 7
The game looks initially very complex, but in reality there are only a few things you can do on your turn. The game slowly opens up and reveals to you its simplicity and then beyond that you see another whole level of complexity. Sounds like I am ranting Aguirre, the Wrath of God-like madness as I travel down the water but play it and you will see.

I do though have a list of caveats and this is why it is no where near my top 10 games. Before you read these bear in mind that I do really like the game!

Firstly I feel the end game scoring cards are possibly unbalanced, well one in particular. Now I am not a designer nor have any pretensions to have an understanding of how to calculate balance in a game, but my gut feeling is that the card where you gain all your company's money into your private pool, and so score it, if your company pays dividends in the last round is too strong. You can gain a lot of money by this method and I have found it to be a game changer. No worries though I will probably play without this card next time. Anyone else experienced this?

I have never thought this before about any game, but the board is too small! Would love to have a bigger board. Folded up it is only 3/4 the cross sectional square area of the box (I have the German edition I am not sure if other editions are different?), would have been better, in my opinion, if they had made it larger so when fold up it fits flush in the box, this would have give a larger playing area.

The Martin Wallace tiddly winks money ... NO .. just no. Please anybody making a game do not use this. It is just awful and I guess I am fickle as it lessens my enjoyment of the game handling blank plastic tiddlywinks for money.

The player boards are too small, there is just not enough room on them for all the money, boats etc you are meant to keep on there. Also you have to keep your personal supply of money and shares separate. Why not make a larger board with room for both piles of money etc on either end.

Oh well I guess most of my gripes are very minor and superficial. 

But hey, ho don't let these minor grumbles put you off from what is a great game. This was a great playing experience and one I want to play again soon (hopefully when I get back home next month). Panamax has definitely moved away from the trade pile. Good game!

RATING: 6.5
Panamax has some really interesting and new mechanics and is a game I can really enjoy.  For me, the game shines when you allow for negotiation between players.  Without it, I feel the game falls a bit flat 

My fairly low rating is due to my believing this is necessary, but not adopted by all players and partly due to the imbalance in the end game bonus cards.

It think there is a good game hiding in here. Very mechanical and our first learning 2 player game took 2,75 hours. We will have to bring that down when we bring in more players at the same time, otherwise it overstays it welcome. There are pretty good parts in this game. Timing is important, filling your pockets when you can, rather than only your company's, is important. Buying shares when you can. And the best part is the moving mechanic, pushing ships through the channel. Need to play more for a better judgement.

Macht einen deutlich ausgereifteren Eindruck als Madeira. Die Regeln sind logisch, funktionieren und lassen wenig Fragen offen. Würde ich sofort wieder mitspielen, bin aber noch unsicher ob ich kaufen. Contra: vergleichsweise hohe Downtime bin noch unsicher wie gut das Spiel auf Lange Sicht funktioniert (Stichwort: Wiederspielreiz und notwendige Interaktion). Auch läuft die letzte Runde auf ein ziemliches Glücksspiel hinaus, wenn man seine Schiffe durch bekommt, prima, bleiben diese aber hängen, ist man schnell abgehängt. Das in Kombination mit der doch recht hohen Spieldauer, kann schnell für Frust sorgen.

There's definitely an interesting game here with pick-up-and-deliver and some action selections based on dice. It's a hard game to grok though and it's unclear yet, whether it's worth the time to figure out if it's truly any good. It does feel unique though.

Totally not my style of game. The optimizing of VP in the last turn, and the special bonus point card draw (5 money or a wild card) late in the game that just screamed Yahtzee to me. We might have got a rule or two wrong though.

Despite all of this, I had FUN while playing, and am looking forward to next time I get the chance.

RATING: 8.4
Heavy euro with a interesting and unique theme. While som fans regard this underrated I think it's score is fair, this is clearly not a game for everyone. There is a lot of mechanics and - while any sane person will love the ship pushing - the stock market mechanisms, separation of company/player money and end game scoring simply makes this too complex for many commoners. But if you like heavy games with with lots of decision making this one is a winner.
At it's core, this is a pick up and delivery game, the stock market is fairly simple in my opinion. There is a lot of player interaction (for a euro) since you can invest in other players companies, load cargo on their ships and even move their ships as if it was your own. 
I have some complains, the top one being that the secret objectives are a bit unbalanced.  The "coins" might be the worst in any game i've played, and the cardboard ships that hold the dice must be handled with care. The rulebook could be better, but there is a FAQ and a fan made rule overview here on BGG. 
Don't let the horrible box art fool you, the artwork within is great. Easily one of my top ten games overall. Best with four players.

RATING: 9
Another very tight game. Every decision is important. You have to manage contracts, goods, ships and movement, which are all limited to the dice roll at the start of each turn. All the while managing company money and stock pricing, and personal money. A lot going on at all times, very rewarding game. Would play any time!

RATING: 6.5
The theme here is different but uninteresting to me, which also goes for the entire graphic design.  It was taught to me with some of the cards house-ruled out (apparently they add extremely swingy victory conditions).  However, the game plays is fairly decent with some very interesting tension and interactions between players trying to help each other out or force others to help them.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Initially rated an 8+, downgraded after playing several games in short succession. This game is interesting and has some very cool features but ultimately has fallen flat for me. There is the appearance of interesting buttons to push and levers to pull but the between the randomness of the contract draw and the limited market actions the game feels more brittle the more I play. This coupled with the relatively long playtime (2.5+ hours) and the tactical nature of that play just means it's eating table time from something more rewarding. I did think that the interactive, push/pull mechanism was worth digging into and I think it's definitely the strongest aspect of the game.

The devil's own pickup and deliver game. With shares and dividends. It blends competition and cooperation, which is something I always love. It's like each player is trying to put together their own puzzle, but they're sharing the pieces. 

First impression was fantastic; we played 3 games and each took ~90 minutes. Want to play.

2nd impression scaled back a little. It was my first 4-player game. I won the award for most valuable stock every round. I thought I had it won, but ended up finishing 2nd by ~$20. What's bugging me is that I don't know how I should have played differently or better, and I can't pinpoint what the winner did to win.

These may be my own failings rather than any fault of the game, but I was left feeling a little deflated after this 3 hour game.

Loved it but had to let it go.

Panamax is more convoluted than it should be: so it is very hard to grasp the relative value of any action.  It also limited in options: so you can easily find yourself in a situation where you feel like there are no good moves available.  In other words, it is a tough, tight economic game with an extremely steep learning curve.  While learning, the experience isn't great: it is more frustrating and confusion.  Additionally, there is so much interaction that you can feel rather out-of-control: what other player's do or don't do has a huge impact on your game.  I think this game is alright, but I prefer a euro games where I have more control.

Dice drafting game, where players pick up contracts, then loads ships with their cargo (sometimes onto other players ships) and push them through the locks.

A solid (first?) effort from these designers, but I find myself enjoying their later designs much more.

I almost got bankrupted and I have trouble realising why this was. Getting too many goods delivered on the first turn probably didn't help, but mostly it seemed like bad contract options while some other players had good options was problematic.
Maybe this was luck of the draw, but I cannot yet determine the amount of RnG in this game.

I hope to get this played sometime soon again, as the rules can be a bit hard to remember/refresh.

You are a shipping company looking to move goods across the Panama canal. You take contracts from 4 different regions and move the goods through the locks or open ocean. To do your action, you choose a die which represents how far you can move, how many goods you can store or increasing your stock price. The interesting mechanic is that goods can be stored on any ship, creating self interest on which ships are moving or not. At the end of the round, you get penalized for goods stuck in the warehouse or those that haven't advanced from the dock. 

There is a lot going on, and you can create interesting dynamics on who you pair up with on your ships. There are difficult choices to pursue - do you increase your stock price? Do you pay money to get out one of your own boats? Which of your boats do you put out? There are many tense decisions, and the game increases the tension as well.

We couldn't finish a game we started, and I'm looking forward to playing a complete game. This has the makings of a good game.

Such a different game at different player counts!  The solitaire PanaBot is delightful, and 2p is similarly cruisey (hah)!  3p is an entirely different game, entirely tighter, leaner, and more tactical.  I expect it's much like that in the 4p game too.
Higher player counts are where the game likely shines, but I doubt I'll often see that.  Traded away barely played.

Game of the year for me (2014). One of the most thematic and interactive eurogames out there! 
I don't care about the balance of the endgame goal cards, these work well for replay-ability and try new things every play.
Love: 
- big decisions of which shares to buy (yours or opponent's)
- dice and flow dynamics that punish unprepared players (most dice for loading/ moving, too many dice at the pool for next round, too many dice at the train station - flags but no money, scarce opportunities to buy shares)
- Interaction moving other's ships and cargo (mostly cooperation when possessing others' shares)

Nothing negative outside the poor quality money for the game.

it's a great game... once you get the rules right. It could take several false starts, with many easy-to-miss provisos* and questionable iconography choices†. Between this and Madeira, consider me a Bizarro fan

RATING: 6.5
It's one of the pre-Essen 14 games that is making more noise, especially for heavy euro lovers. Mefis just bought it and we didn't wait a lot to get it tested :-)

The rules are not easy to learn. They are many, and then there are also quite a few "details" that you need to take in account. In that regard, it is not an elegant game. You need at least some good 45 minutes to get everything explained. After that, the setup is quite OK for a game of this genre.

[url=http://boardgamegeek.com/play/details/12844136]I first played it Oct 10th, 2014, at Mefis' in Santovenia, with Jooor and him.[/url] 

It is indeed a medium to heavy euro game. Every turn you'll choose between several possibilities and each action has quite a few ramifications... You'll even need to take in account what other players will do.

The most surprising feature its nice level of interaction. Not only you can load your goods on other people boats, you can move them, you can push them, you can buy actions of your companies, initiative fight, etc. These actions can have a deep impact in how well they do. And plus, you have the "indirect" interactions: "stealing" their contracts, or their actions, or boats, blocking the railway track...

On the other side, this interaction comes at the cost of losing some control about your outcome. This is a rather obvious conclusion, given that the actions of your rivals can affect you, for good or for bad.

Planning ahead (more than 1 round ahead) is difficult, because you never know for sure what the other players are going to do. This can be very important on the last turn. Still , it's easy to set a general direction and follow it.

The game features lots of dice, but very few actual rolls (only at the begining of the turn, to set the available actions, and even there, you'll do mulligans if you get something extreme). Still, luck is an important factor in this available actions and also in the contrats available.

*I think giving dividends in the last turn is paraomunt to win. You'll probably have bought actions of your company (that gives you more control over your destiny, and also gives your company cash flow to pay for the maintenance costs). I won 32 of my 106 points thanks to that, a percentage way too high. Of course, you can buy actions of your rivals during the first 2 rounds (it can actually pays off, especially in the first turn), but probably they won't be paying dividends and then you depend on them doing well, and that is not very nice. 


In a few words:
+:

-> Great interaction for a heavy euro.

-: 
-> Too much importance on dividends*
-> Luck to big a factor for a heavy euro

I don't have a strong opinion on this. I need more games to be sure.

Gioco interessante e originale con forte interazione. Il gioco dura tre turni e in sostanza ogni giocatore avrà a disposizione solo 12 azioni in tutta la partita. I tantissimi dadi verranno raramente lanciati ma servono a determinare i valori delle merci da consegnare nei vari molti attraverso il Canale di Panama. Panamax è un gioco strategico dove il caso è presente meno di quanto interazione e dadi possano far pensare di primo acchito. Il gioco è anche paradossalmente ben ambientato, si tratta di imbarcare dei carichi (i propri dadi) su navi mercantili e spingerle attraverso il canale a volte avvantaggiando navi di altri giocatori che sono già presenti nel meccanismo delle varie chiuse del canale. L'unico aspetto negativo che ho riscontrato è la lunga spiegazione iniziale anche se alla fine le dinamiche sono fluide e intuitive.

RATING: 3.5
This just feels like a helluva lot more laboured version of the Steam series or Chicago Express. The cost for dice-reassignment seems to be rather misjudged in comparison to the rest of the game, and the action count seems to be off by one each round.

Initial thoughts after one play...

Panamax is an interesting heavy euro with a lot of tough decisions to make. AP can be a huge problem with this game because each action carries a lot of weight and you get so few of them throughout the game. The game forces you to play both tactically and strategically and mistakes are often punished, qualities that I like. The main problem with Panamax is that its very fiddly. You'll often watch in horror as dice fall off the ship pieces and have to be carefully placed back on with the appropriate number of pips showing. This can be an arduous task when you are pushing a bunch of ships around in the same move action. I would rate the game higher if this wasn't such a big issue with the game since the number of pips showing dictates how much money your company is going to make.

The game is too heavy and has too many moving parts for its own good.  Unforgiving--a bad turn and you are out of it.  AP becomes prevalent as the game goes on.

I like heavier games but this one fell flat for me.

RATING: 8
A unique concept for  game but it has a ton of strategy involved to it. This is a game where more than one play is required since you will do fairly awful the first few games until you pick up the mechanics of the game and learn how set up your shipping company to benefit from them.

[i]Ouch, my head still hurts from playing this game. I love some heavier games, but this one pushed the envelope for me. I found the game to be rather long (I played a 3p game and it took over 2 and 1/2 hours to finish), and really I don;t think there are that many interesting choices to make. You pretty much have to figure out how to most efficiently transport your goods to turn a profit.

The one thing I really liked was buying stock in your company and others, especially since you had to pay dividends out to your shareholders each round out of the company's profit.
If you couldn't your company lost value and you didn;t get money (personal wealth is the determining factor in deciding who wins, not your company's money).[/i]

Based on one play: You have to load ships and sent them across the canal. Seems simple but there is a lot to it and explaining the intricacies is not obvious, you need to just play. I would definitely need another play through but overall it is fairly original and heavy (which I like) as you manage owning shares in other players companies and moving boats around while causing others to pay higher maintenance costs (which are a killer).

Panamax is a business game with some really good money management decision points. Players take on the role of a shipping company, obtaining contracts from four countries to move goods (dice) across the Panama canal. However, unless you've delivered a die this turn, you need to pay a storage cost for each die at the end of the turn, whether that die is in your warehouse or on a contract waiting to be loaded (high costs), or if it's on a ship on the canal (lower costs). You need to constantly evaluate whether it's best to try to avoid crippling storage costs or try to actually complete your shipments. You're pretty much forced to help your opponents with every move, as you'll often load your goods on their ships, or "push" their ships along the narrow track, but fortunately you can invest in them, too. What really struck me about the game, though, was how much it really seemed like a busy shipping corridor.

RATING: 7
This is basically a 3-4 player game bordering on only 4 players. This game involves using and putting cargo on others ships, but when no one is moving or using your ships it can be a bit frustrating. Some of the goal cards feel a bit over powered unless we had read them wrong. Simplish rules, but a lot to absorb the first play. Pretty opaque strategy, too.

I enjoyed it quite a bit, but it's very group dependent.

During my one play, we missed some key rules and actually played a 4th round, instead of ending after the 3rd. Nevertheless, I really enjoyed the game. Money is tight and figuring out when to buy shares, when to spend your company’s money, and which stocks to buy are really tough choices. On top of this, loading goods, moving ships, and choosing bonuses all present a great many ways to approach the game. I think there is some moderate to significant depth in the game that will only be revealed after repeated plays. I do not think this is something I’ll play 20+ times, but there are a number of good plays ahead, with a chance for the rating to increase.

This is a sort of 18XX with boats on the Panama-canal. This is some heavy shit to play. My major concern with this game is that the player who is left alone, by whom I mean that no other players put containers on his boats, is screwed, as you really need the movements of your ships by other players as you have Mutual interests. So 3 players is probably a horrible number for this game as 2 players can help eachother and the 3rd is left alone.

This is a big game. I am not a fan of 18xx titles, not entirely fair since I haven't played them so I can't compare the 2. I like the mechanic in this game of having dice represent goods on the boats and pushing the boats through the canal. It is very interesting. Unclear if I will play it again. I do own it and have been considering trying to 2p. Not sure it is a game I will get to the table a lot but I enjoyed my one play.

A typical Euro; one of those, where you can ponder endlessly when it's your turn. And you can do nothing when it's not your turn. If you like puzzle solving and don't mind AP, you might like it. But it's no game for me.

RATING: 8
The general idea of the game is you have two sides of the canal, loaded with some unaligned ships. You have a set of dice that represent cargo, that are divided into two groups. One half to ship this turn, one half to ship next turn. Your goal is to get the dice to sit in spots that won't cost you a lot of money to store, and ideally get them across the canal so they earn you money instead. This is done by more or less putting your ships in the way of other ships, so they have to push you out. Add to that this interesting element of being able to load your cargo onto or move any ship on the board, not just your own, and being able to invest in other players so you get payouts from their successes and you have a really brain burning game. All this, and you yourself only get 12 turns. 4 actions per round. Wow.

This game does want exactly 4 players, even though the box says 2-4, because with fewer than 4 players, there aren't really enough move actions taken to make sure that starting on either side of the canal is viable. Additionally,  a few bits of the game are unnecessarily hard to understand including the cards and the rail track that determines turn order. It's manageable, but these elements keep this game from being easily teachable.

I've had this game for over a year and it finally made it to my table.  Overall mechanics were easy to pick up, though we did make a number of mistakes right through to the end.  I lost dearly, but in the end really had a good time with it and I am looking forward to playing again.  Not my favorite, and I can find others I'd rather play, but I think after a few plays the ability to develop a strategy will come out.  The instructions are lousy (seems to be the case with so many games), and found it necessary to watch Rhado numerous times. (Though he didn't seem to be overly sure of his play either :)

Mit ne mondjak, komplex! A javából. A szabály alapján nem látszott ennyire kemény diónak. Ha valahol igaz, hogy minden mindennel összefügg, akkor itt ez megállja a helyét. Tematikus kétségtelen, és nagyon jól össze van rakva, de, hogy mi vezet célra azt nem tudnám megmondani. Ezzel kell még a játék mindenképpen.
Valahol zseniális dolog, hogy nem tudom megmondani, hogy mi lehet a győzelem kulcsa. Csupán azt tudom, hogy kivéreztetni a céget az elején botor dolog, talán ha tolja bele a pénzt az ember, akkor talán többre juthat. Persze tök utolsó lettem, ami nem baj, csak éppen nem is jó!:)

Update: Nagyon jó játék, persze csak 3ból második lettem, de kibeba...tt izgalmas volt, két komoly hibát vétettem, az egyik, hogy az ellenfél hajóit végül nem küldtem be magasabb illetékű helyre, illetve rosszul számoltam ki hogy kinek jár a ügyvezetői, és nem tudtam a szabályt sem jól, így nem tudtam osztalékot fizetni, és ügyvezetői is hozzá került. Én nagyon élveztem, bár kissé felhúztam magam ezen a hibadömpingen. Mindezek ellenére ha valaki egy érdekes tematikájú heavyeuro-ra vágyik, ahol át is jön a téma, akkor ez remek választás. Nekem ez összetettebb, mint a madeira.(Csak a szerző miatt kapcsolom össze:))

Aug 2015: Demo'ed at GENCON. I enjoyed the play. Althea had a hard time enjoying it due to our down time. Any plans were impacted by prior moves and you had to take the best at the moment. In truth, there were 2 big-choices: take a contract or move ships. (buying stock from executive actions also) I think it would be improved with few turns per round and more rounds - probably made lighter also and that isn't my intention.

Heavy euro with a brutal balance of budget/stock-holding. At first, the flow of money can seem very abstract and cumbersome, but after one game it all seems very obvious. I enjoy the idea of players separately representing both their company and personal finances. Knowing when to move boats or let opponents spend their actions moving them can be tricky, but it's extremely satisfying to get a huge payout without spending any effort due to careful planning. This game is filled with moments like that, and I'd gladly return to Panamax, even though it sports a lengthy play time.

I wasn't grabbed by this game. You ship cargos through the canal and manage loading, shipping, budgets, stock etc. The central shipping mechanism is very interesting but there is so much chrome that doesn't do much. The dice rolling system is awkwardly rigged because the designer obviously couldn't think themselves out of cards and the stock trading just vanishes in the mass of other elements. Its a medium-heavy euro game, which is a competitive field, and the central difficulty (finite actions) is very similar to so many others.

(+) Limited ruleset, yet meaningful decisions. You feel like each decision matters greatly

(+) Little downtime. Turns pass around rather quickly and decisions other player make can have real impact on others

(+) The logistics-aspect shines through in theme and gameplay

(+) Very interesting player interaction with lots of 'You scratch my back, I'll scratch yours'-possibilities and opportunities for interesting win-win situations.

(+) Little luck dependance (this is no dice game!). However, you can get lucky with financial advisor cards or the right contract cards. The way contract cards get combined with action dice can make a big difference to an individual player.

(+/-) Some engine building aspects when collecting flags and passengers allow you to get a feeling of progress, yet these might be too little, too late... The engine building aspects are nice and are a sure strategic path to follow - but I would have liked to see a little more of those opportunities to stimulate (early) investment.


(+/-) The game is as exciting as you make it: you nééd to invole other players in your actions by shipping your goods on their boats and stimulating others to ship goods on yours. Failing to do so makes for bad strategic choices and a very unexciting and dry game.


(-) The stock holding mechanism feels rather unexciting. There are few opportunities to carry out stock market actions and there is little possibility for stock manipulation. This is not a stock market game like 18xx

(-) The rulebook does a bad job of explaining the game.

(-) Components are a little bit 'fiddly'. Why are the loading zones dark blue? They should display a big flag of the corresponding nation! Why are some lakes so small? Boats and dice fall off... Why are the bailout-tokens double-sided? The in game money is a pain to use.

(-) With only 12 actions there is not a whole lot players can experiment with: you need to get your containers out of the warehouse and ship them through 3 times with only those 12 actions. On one hand, this creates tense and captivating gameplay in which each decision matters greatly - but on the other hand it leaves little flexibility in building up your firm.

TIPS:
(*) Try to buy a share in a company you believe in (a firm which will likely always pay dividends) early in the game, when prices are low. At the start of the game it can be worthwile to invest in other players firms. Near the end of the game it might make more sense to increase your personal stock holdings in your own firm granted you are able to pay out dividends
(*) Moving a military ship around of a nation of which you own multiple flags really helps a lot in generating personal wealth and investment opportunities.
(*) Loading containers on trains allows you to take a 'free' flag and ensures you don't have to pay anything for that container at the end of the round.
(*) Spice the game up by creating player interaction: invest in an opponents firms and maximise the chance of getting dividends by helping their dice through the canal. Getting a steady flow of dividend income is really important.
(*) Let the financial advisor cards aid you in building up a bigger strategic goal. The card which yields you $5 per passenger token is a nice one: if you have this card at the beginning of the game, start shipping passengers as soon as possible: this wil net a nice income and unlock nice benefits early on your tableau!
(*) Captain cards gained when your small ship reaches the other side of the canal make your life a lot easier. Always be on the lookout to gain such a card!
(*) Whenever possible, try to always put important ships into a lock. That way you ensure they will get pushed through by yourself or others.

The rules are awful in this game!  We read through them and still had no idea how to play a turn, even though we understood how various other things worked.  A second read through, and over an hour later we started, only to have to restart two turns in, as we'd missed a stage of setup!  The game itself is quite different from many other games out there, but doesn't really draw me in for repeat plays unfortunately.

Played it at Essen 2014 with one of the designers (Nuno). We talked about 18XX games and how we both love 'em. Well, knowing this and smelling a fantastic combination of movement, stock share trading and player interaction catapulted the game directly on my wishlist! One of my two highlights at "Spiel '14".

Disclaimer: I do not enjoy heavy Economic Euros!!! Most definitely not my style of games. Having said that...


I just played this game for the second time after having first played it two years ago. This is a very good game! It is insanely interactive, beautiful to look at and with a fantastic graphical design that makes the board very easy to read. The artwork is cartoony and it makes the economic theme much more accessible. I love the dice rolling to dictate round actions, the mini stock market, and the fact that ypu can load your goods in any opponent's ship and also move said ships. That creates the meat of the game which is the amazing interaction btw players. However, The 4 player game does have some serious downtime, so if you're not into that sort of thing, beware. I think 3p may be the sweet spot here. I gotta say though, This game is a well oiled machine!  This and Brass are the only two heavy economic games that I'll play again so far. Truly impressive design imo!

This game uses dice to set the actions available to the players, similar to War of the Ring or Conan. After that it is an exercise of optimization of movements in orden to cross your ships and cargo across the channel, trying to let other players "help" you doing so. It has some elements of a stock market in the mix also.

The first time I played Panamax, I hated it. But it wouldn't leave my brain. Turns out I just had a terrible teacher, and that it's a really balanced and well-designed economic Euro. A lot of rules to grasp at first, but well worth the effort to learn.

RATING: 7
Panamax is mechanically innovative, with lots of player interaction and strategies that will take several plays to explore. I enjoy themes that are unusual but grounded in reality, and in this respect, Panamax delivers. 

Compared to the rest of the game, the stock market feels underdeveloped. During play, when the opportunity presents itself, one should always buy a stock if one can afford it (no real decision space there). 

The game does not scale well and is best at the full player count.

Panamax has some cool ideas, but there are a few aspects of the implementation that really hold it back. Some of the contracts just let you get more goods ready than others. When it's 2 or 3 dice, it's fine, but it's not worth spending an action to get 1 die of cargo and load it. The backs of all of the contracts should be 2-3 cargo so that you always have the option of getting enough cargo. The other thing is that the end game scoring cards are very poorly balanced. Some are much better than others, and in at least one case there is a card that is strictly better than another card.

A lot of good things about the game, but there is a huge luck factor early in the game based on the cards which show up.  For example if one player starts on the east side of the board and all other players start on the west side, the player on the east side can be out of the game after the first round.  It is especially important to deliver at least one passenger early (to get the bonus which allows you to pick cards from the upcoming stacks as well as the card that is available on the board).  Loading one contract from each of the four countries is also important (but less so) so that you can move dice between the contract area and movement area for free.

In any case, having played the game several times with four players, it seems like there is a good possibility that one player ends up out of the game after the first round due to which contracts happen to show up early.  Flipping the cards over to load the #3 dice anywhere is massively less powerful because not only do you get lower valued dice (and less of them) you also don't get the marker from the country which is needed for end game points and bonus abilities.

RATING: 3.5
I'm not yet sure what to think of it - seems like an old time economic game (i.e. not workerplacement) meets some contemporary  euro ideas, like: stongly integrated theme and being a bit too complex for what it is. The problem with evaluation is that I'm not sure how much is just smoke and mirrors and how much the game can actually deliver.

Firstly it's a bit too complex for what it is, it has chrome and all sorts of bells and whistles. While they greatly support the theme, I'm not sure how essential they are to the gameplay. Secondly for a serious euro there's a lot of luck involved, but again, it supports the theme. Thirdly there's a promise of an interesting interaction, just not sure how much of it is justified.
The stock marked is kinda half assed (and yet, it won me my only game of it, by buying my own stock) Then the whole [i]"let's push this boat together"[/i] thing is neat and probably the best thing about this game - a  mechanics from Survive which is about splitting duties and shared incentives. The whole [i]"whee, let's push a row of boats[/i] is also a fun idea, but not sure for how evil purpuses it can be abused (can you afford to hurt others as the actions are limited).  In the end, with all the options one has precious few actions (12 per game).

The biggest question about this game is what does it want to achieve - for serious eurogamers it's probably a bit too random and probably has too much interaction for them ([i]oh noes, what do you do if people form alliances?[/i]). And for a thematic ride, which it kinda is, it's still a game about economic endeavour and planning and stuff. And then I'm still not quite sure how interactive and nasty the game can be (with 4 players) and how much depth it actually has. Which I guess tells a lot about current euros - using complexity more for looking impressive than to actually justify it in the gameplay.  You know: it has theme, it has crome, it has sweet visuals, so what more do you want? What? strate... what? I like the thematic part of it, so it has that, but it's kinda thinky for that. Will need further plays to evaluate.

[i]Though I must say I had a fun narrative - in the second round I managed to get all of my company's money into my pockets. Great In the third round I was lost, the only thing to do was minimise loses (and buy other people's stock). Funny thing - with my company being broke I bought a share in it, transferring my private money (back) to the company. I still had to cover the loses from my own pocket, however this machination got me a share that is automatically sold at the end of the game, covering about 1/2 of that loss. So I saved a lot of money by transferring money from one account to the other, talk about money laundering... Actually that's probably how management buyout works - get money from company to your pocket then use it to buy share of the company.. [/i]

I think I liked the idea of this game more than the actual play.  The luck of contract card draw is rather frustrating, and moving ships around was much easier than I thought which was little disappointing.

Fascinating economic game. I think many of the elements here are interconnected in interesting ways, which made me want to at least show it to my group. It seems pretty obvious to just buy your own stock when you have the chance, but how to maximize the dividends so that the company doesn't end up flush with cash is much less clear and provides a fun challenge. I really enjoy the movement, and that it's good to get ships loaded and put into the canal so that others can push them along if they are in the locks. Between that and figuring out how to deliver some goods to minimize cargo payments is awesome, trying to work out the timing also is really cool. I am concerned about the dramatic change in points caused by the endgame scoring cards, but perhaps if you know this from the beginning, it's much less troubling.
 
Overall, I remain undecided on exactly the rating for this and would like a couple of future plays before deciding where to let this one settle in.

Yet another new-to-me winner from Stronghold! This one was much less convoluted than Kanban, more of a typical Euro economic game where you have to cooperate somewhat, although you try to arrange for other people to have to cooperate with you more than the other way around! 

Very good game -- will need to play this again!

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
The board shows the Panama Canal, with neutral boats on either side and a few player ships placed as well. Players each have a company player mat, with company money, and their own cash hoard. Start with a mini draft, each person choosing to keep one end-game VP score card (which only they will score; helps direct your play, too!). Players also take a starting contract, which shows 1-3 containers (value 1-6 each). Each of 3 rounds, roll a bunch of d6 and allocate to the action spaces on the board (like in Yspahan). Players then take turns choosing a die and using its action: move ships, claim a new contract and/or load ships, raise your company's share price, or buy a share in anyone's company. If you move a ship to its destination (the opposite side of the Canal from where it started), all dice on it pay their owner companies cash; the boat owner may also get a reward (captain, stevedore, or VP card). When the round ends (after all the dice have been used), companies pay expenses for dice still in the warehouse, or still somewhere in the canal -- prices vary by location, and dividends if possible. The best company (highest priced share) gets a VP reward. At the end of the game, sell all shares to bank for their full price, score end-game VP cards, etc: most PERSONAL cash wins.

RATING: 8
I've had this game for a long time.  Close to 3 years and I've finally played it for the first time.  This was a hard one to get to the table to begin with because it is complex and it also isn't the most interesting theme to most people, involving investing in and managing shipping companies who make loops through the Panama canal delivering goods to either side.  On top of which the rulebook while actually pretty well written is also very dense and daunting.  I, a person who typically prefers heavier games, have given up on the rulebook on several occasions without getting through the setup section and was never able to find a good video tutorial online either.

Anyway, how is the actual game?  Pretty good and pretty unique once you get to playing it.  One of the biggest sources of confusion is each player is trying to amass the largest personal wealth to win the game but each player also manages a shipping company.  The assets of the company and player are kept separate and there is no embezzlement in this game.  Knowing when to pay or collect your own money or your companies is a bit confusion on a first play.  You can also invest in other player's companies and even put your goods on their ships and move neutral, cruise, and military ships for other benefits as well.  There are many layers of strategy.

I think this game would have a hard time finding an audience with everyone.  It's one of the most dense games I've played, rules-wise.  But if you are the kind of person that likes interesting economic mechanics this is quite a departure from every other game I've played and makes for a nice diverse addition to the game shelf.

An unhappy combination of very tight and unforgivable mechanics and high point swings in form of a second endgame objective drawn mid-game (that can range from "you will never be able to get any points for this" to "here's 20 more points for stuff you already did"). 
A 4-player game also has the possibility to lock a single player completely out of one kind of flag marker, throwing them out of serious competition without any of their own doing. Shame since the movement system is fresh and compelling.

Shared ownership/incentive management game where ships sail from one end of the Panama Canal to the other, with bonuses both for the company whose cargo is carried and the owner of the ship it is on. There are opportunities to buy shares, receive dividends etc.

The bad is that the game feels overloaded with unnecessary and distracting detail like financial advisors (end-game scoring goals), passengers (different payouts, ongoing bonuses), unique ships and so on, presumably because the excision of route-building -- it's clear there is train-game DNA here -- did not leave quite enough to do. Perhaps this complaint ultimately boils down to "it isn't a Winsome or an 18XX", but I do feel that many of the game's elements obscure the interesting central questions (shared usage of ships and the canal). Unlike, say, Brass, I do not feel that this detail adds significant historical or thematic flavour.

I am also increasingly irritated by the capricious effects of random contract cards and, to a lesser extent, action distribution.

This is a very tough game. You almost have to treat it as a semi-coop game and work in parallel with other players. If you are the only player headed east to west some turn, you are going to have a very hard time. 

Also getting the one cruise bonus that let's you take cards from the draw (and next) stacks can make a big difference.

RATING: 5
Some interesting stuff in here, but it is overly complicated for what it is, and the balance on end game scoring cards is really questionable.  There are huge point swings in the game and a somewhat higher luck factor than one wants to see in a game this heavy.  I think playing optimally requires a ton of math to figure out just how hard to screw the person next to you.  There are quite a few little rough-edge rules to remember, and the game only does a so-so job of adhering to the theme to help with that.

I so wanted to like this game.  it hit so many sweet spots for me. Pick up and delivery, stock market game, very 18xx like, company money vs personnel money, naval theme.  The problem is the Contract Deck.  The Deck drives so much of the game probably about 60 percent of the game flow depends upon which contract you get.  But ..... they come out very randomly.  I believe that the last player turn one is at a huge disadvantage.  Each time I played I could not get my hands on a railroad icon and got behind in the flag token count.  As last player I could not get my ships in front of others to have them help me through the canal like the first player.  Because of the poor mitigation techniques I will not buy this game and will probably never play it again I am sad to say.

There's a nice game in here about using dice to move ships, but for some reason someone stuck a totally unnecessary stock manipulation mechanic on top of it. What's worse, your incentive is simply to keep buying up more of your stock, rather than buying out shares in a more successful opponent's company - so yeah, just focus on winning the boats game and your stock game will follow. It's disappointing, because a good editor (or some restraint) would have made for a better game.

Man, this rulebook isn't great at all. It fails to make clear right away things that are not actually complex at all. And the structure fails to point your attention to important details that might be easy to miss or forget. And it is completely useless for looking up information during play.
That being said, this appears to be a very solid game. Unfortunately we made a mistake a crucial mistake in the first round. I had explained it correctly, but when players bought shares, they forgot to put that money in the company. Which lead to companies not having enough money to pay dividends, which lead to devaluation. The result that money was very, very tight. I managed making the best of it by using the second round to set me up for a big third round.
This game is all about timing. When to get new contracts? When to load the ships? But most of all: when to start moving the ships. The pushing mechanism is what makes the game interesting but also hard to play well.
I wish we hadn't made the mistakes we did make, but I look forward to playing it again as I can see this being a hit in my group.

In Panamax, you will, at every turn, choose between two actions: load boats or move them. Despite this apparent simplicity, Panamax is not easy and offers a unique gaming pleasure with the way it is immersed in its theme, Cornelian choices (which slow the game), the interaction between players can be devastating and management of two separate but related assets (the one of your company and the other of your own). Panamax clearly deserves to be distinguished from the production of Essen this year and is already one of the must buy of this year as game pleasures are high.

This game could easily be an 8 with repeat plays. I just don't know. After a single play, I like the game, but I'm also puzzled. As is, I find Panamax fits (imperfectly) into a design space similar to that explored by people like Vital Lacerda. On the positive side, it's a game of economics and optimization, but also of shared incentives. On the other hand, these positive qualities are potentially overshadowed by the game's broad complexity, i.e., the need to overlay multiple systems, not all of which clearly relate to one another.

That potential lack of focus is what gives me pause. Do you really need secret objective cards or bonuses for having the highest paying stock price each round? What do these complications incentivize during the game and how do they further the inter-player competition? My suspicion is that they don't do either of those things, and that these systems instead act as unnecessary cruft in what is otherwise a heavyweight game that is tight with brain-burning decisions. If I was a developer, I'd be tempted to offer the following advice: Don't sully the package with individual goals that work apart from the other players. Instead, focus on the solid core system by having the wherewithal to streamline.

Same goes for the action-selection system, which seems fiddly. At its core, the system isn't that interesting. Better to have a straightforward system that puts the focus on moving and loading ships, and investing in the stock market. Instead, just as a matter of bookkeeping each round, someone has to roll a bucketful of dice to determine which actions will be available, and then arrange those dice in order of priority within each action. The higher the priority, the more a player is allowed to do with the action. On your individual turn, when selecting an action, you have to assess multiple vectors for each action and debate whether or not to spend money to improve your options (a cost which is typically reduced to zero mid-way through the game, so why bother in the first place?). And what does all this effort do to improve gameplay? Eh... not much. It feels like complications for complications' sake. I'm sure experience will improve familiarity which will in turn lesson the mental load, but as is, it feels like an unnecessary act in decoding something that should be a transparent way of selecting a player's priorities for the turn.

None of these complaints, keep in mind, are enough to detract me from playing the game again. I enjoyed Panamax, and I hope to have my mind changed in future plays. The big-picture decisions are difficult in the best possible way. You won't have enough time to get all your boats through the canal, and you absolutely must balance profits against what can be a devastating amount of cargo fees each round. That core is what makes Panamax an engrossing and rewarding experience. I just hope its additional complications turn out to be something more than a needless test of mental computation.

There are a lot of interconnected mechanics and bits and pieces and we have not really learned how to control your game and score high. The board is very busy and the visual cues are a bit lacking, but of course after a few games you will just know what each icon means and what goes where. 

Our scores varied wildly, and one player had made a bad decision in her first round which resulted in a lot of freight on expensive places, so she had to take a loan and her stocks went down quickly. Not sure how you can catch up. It may be easy to avoid such mistakes, but the game certainly does not give you safety rails to prevent them.

Panamax is a dice selection game about shipping goods through the Panama canal.  Dice are rolled every turn and assigned to various actions based on value.  You select a die and preform the appropriate action, which are mostly getting goods and moving ships.  There is a lot of jostling for position, as many ship movements require you to push other people's ships ahead of your own.

This is a game that is incredibly interesting, which of course means I was absolutely horrible at it.  In our three player game, I came in distant last with half the score of the 2nd place player.  There were a couple of things that I know I did wrong, but honestly, I think I'll probably do just as badly in subsequent plays.  And yet, I still want to play this game again.

[thing=131287][/thing] is an economic and strategic game that uses pick and deliver, worker placement (dice), a companies from which you can buy shares, control investments and pay dividends. As its description mentions, [thing=131287][/thing] has a dice (action) selection table, pickup-and-deliver along a single bi-directional route, a chain reaction movement system -“pushing” ships to make room throughout the Canal and player interaction that is part self-interest, part mutual advantage.

It seems rather daunting with all its moving parts and possibilities, yet, when the game is going, the flow is rather steady and easy to grasp - it is the strategic demands and choices with folding effects that make for the depth and challenge of the game.

[thing=131287][/thing] has a steep learning curve, as it mixes a strong timming for decisions - when to take a certain dice, when to move a ship, in which order, when to put a cargo on someone else's ship, in which part of the world to put a new ship, or to start an contract, when buy a stock, and so on. There is a lot to think about, and, oh, so little time to do it - the play briskly passes on, giving too few actions for anyone to really feel confortable about what they are doing - there is this constant feeling of dread that the plans won't work, that something will fall short. And the fees for doing things wrong can be huge!

The decision-making process isn't always clear, due to the timming concerns and the fact that everyone takes actions from the same pool of dice, which brings tension to the choices and the importance of prioritizing.

Overall, [thing=131287][/thing] gives a lot to think about, even though is malevolent enough to only give a tiny amount of actions to be made during the briskly paced playing time of around 2 hours. For my tastes, I prefer [thing=154809][/thing] and [thing=95527][/thing] to [thing=131287][/thing], yet this one is also well done, clever and have some unique mechanisms.

Instead of trying to win or just play a game it felt like we were going to be in a bad position no matter what and just trying to minimize the bad position.  Probably just need to play it a few more times but I don't think I am going to.

Interesting game dynamic between loading/stalling for a more complete loadout (and therefore more efficient shipping) vs racing to shove your boats in the lock so as to benefit from other people's moves. Has been growing on me each time I have played (4 times). Started as an 8, now up to 8.5; who knows, maybe will hit a 9 in the future...

Because of the fact that you really need exactly four players, and players need to go through a very lengthy rules explanation before playing, it might be hard for me to bring this game to the table more than once or twice. The structure of the rulebook does not help either - it is hard to look up some detail as soon as the game is underway. Furthermore, setup is quite lengthy and fiddly with all the different cardstock counters and small font on the components. And finally, players need to be aware of the fact that the gameplay offers very little room for error. All that being said, I really enjoyed my first play of the game. Rules fall into place surprisingly quickly despite the inconsistent iconography, there is some delicious turn angst to be had, and the theme definitely shines through in the mechanics. The theme is just so interesting and unique! Also, there is definite skill involved in moving the ships through the canal as efficiently as possible. Hope to play this one again in the future, but I am pessimistic considering the steep learning curve.

The poster child for great concept ruined by poor execution; it's as if the developers were completely asleep at the wheel when play testing this game.

Panamax is a bit of an odd duck. The notes in the rulebook indicate that it started out as a much lighter family game and evolved into something heavier. The main mechanism that drives Panamax does indeed feel like a typical light Euro, with players focusing on puzzling out the most efficient way to move their cargo through the canal. This part of the game provides most of the fun, but I suppose if that is all there was to it that it would quickly be solved after a couple of plays. Layered on top however, is an economic stock game of sorts.

It's not quite a full stocks and shares system. There is no way to take control of another player's company and no good reason to ever tank your own company. I haven't personally seen it happen yet, but I think there is some potential for one player to buy a share of another player's company to intentionally drive up the dividend payout so that the company can't pay it. I feel like that is pretty rare though and the expense of such a move is probably not a net gain for the player who takes such an action. As it sits, I think it is just a catch up mechanism, or rather a means of preventing a run away leader buy spreading one company's success to all of the players.

It's also a game of negotiation and success hinges on getting other players to move your cargo for you. I suspect the share system also drives that, as having interest in another player's company being profitable makes those negotiations much easier, ensuring that they happen and things keep moving through the canal at a brisk pace.

In other words, it feels tacked on but I can see the benefits of having the system in place. For now, I like it quite a bit but I could see it falling off if the depth on the economic side of the game is an illusion, which I suspect it might be. If further play shows the game can be won and lost in the share system as much as it can be on the pick up and deliver side, my rating will stay firm. If I find it is just a cleverly disguised catch up mechanic driven by no brainer purchasing decisions, then my rating will likely slide down.

Rating might change in future. 

Played it twice up to now.

First attempt was a two player game. I was not really convinced when we ended. We made a lot of major errors.  We played with 4 actions per player and round and not the six as it would be correct for two players. Forgot to increase the share price after a shares was bought and much more. 

Did a second game, a simulation with four players, but all played by me and was hooked immediately by the game. Panama channel was much more populated with all special ships in action and more player ships.  Big impact on pushing ships through the locks.  I love complex games  where your brain has to work hard and this one, I can image, belongs to the group.  

Hope my rating will be bolstered by more sessions in next future.

Nice mechanics and somewhat thematic but ultimately fails due to too few options. You only get 12 actions and they can be very good or do almost do nothing depending on card draw and dice rolls. Also you can't plan your actions during other people's turn so downtime is bad. Had it as 7,5 initially.

Really wanted to like this game more (as I am a big fan of Nuno and Paulo) and played it a few more times, but have now decided that this game is way too fiddly and the rulebook is poorly written which makes this game not fun to play.  Still a huge fan of Madeira and Nippon, though, and looking forward to future games they design as a duo.

One of the better games from 2014 crop. The only couple of marks against it is it's sometimes a little long to play esp teaching the game. There's enough rules questions that I had to keep flicking back to the rulebook (which isn't easy to find the answer quickly). However, it's a totally absorbing game to me. Both this and KanBan float my boat.

RATING: 6
I had a mind-bogglingly low score in my first game (51 pts vs. the winner's 120 pts), which was partly my fault and partly not.  The two serious contenders latched onto the strategy of investing in each other's companies and cooperating in their shipping duties, which paid handsomely.

I like coop and partnership games, but games that force players to choose arbitrary partners to stay competitive really aren't my bag.

Still, Panamax isn't a worked placement game (+3 euro bonus points), and its theme and mechanics are fresh in a way that only Central America can be.  Though there are valid complaints about unbalanced investor cards (i.e., endgame bonuses), and the intricate rules are bound to scare away the light of heart.

I would play again, partly to prove that I'm not a complete idiot and partly to see if the fuss is really warranted.

[i]Update:[/i]

I played a second time and did much better (two points from winning!), but there are two aspects of the game that still bother me: (1) the variable quality of the investor cards and (2) it's always in a player's best interest to purchase their own stock. Given point #2, why bother to include a stock system in the first place?

My final judgment: Panamax could have used additional development and streamlining, and games that aren't quite finished don't rank highly on my to-play list.

RATING: 9.5
I would give the game play itself a near 10, despite it's length, we never felt like it was long. My only complaint is the not particularly well written rule book, which is both confusing and vague for things that are important and should have more clarity. Because of this, the first round took forever as we kept needing to reach for the rulebook. Once we figured out what the heck we were doing, the last two rounds flew. It's a very very engaging game. Even when it's not your turn, actions require your attention.

I've played a couple games now and thoroughly enjoy Panamax. The randomized dice rolling action selection aspect of the game in combination with the stock market and pick-up and deliver mechanics all work great together. There are quite a few things going on in the game and, while it seems tricky at first, I feel that everything is fairly seamless.

The balance of "company" money and "player" money is quite tight throughout the game. I found this out the hard way twice now and ended up pooching myself early on in the first game and then right at the end in my last one. You also don't get a good feel how everything comes together until you've played at least one full game as the end game winning conditions aren't truly apparent until you cash our your stocks and tally up your financial adviser cards.

This a game that I think will only get better with time as you gain an appreciation about how things work together and as you try to benefit from the other players actions. The game looks as though it would really play differently when playing with the advanced setup as the stock market and individual player money would be different and everyone wouldn't start on the same footing. Unfortunately... this is also a game that I already know that I'm going to want to play a lot more than the people in my group, which is going to make exploring the game and its nuances and little difficult to do...

I love the look of this game, but may not acquire it due to the individualized scoring cards. 

Another potentially great game about ships suffers from this as well, Shipyard. Suburbia is bad because of it. The only instance I like of this mechanic is Troyes because the bonus points are awarded to every player.

Intricate and rather interesting to play.  Plenty of fun choices.  I just wish there were a short player aid of the more tedious bits e.g. in some of the leftover space on the board or on a player aid card, or something.  With several copies of the rules, so multiple players could look things up, things go pretty quickly, but it would be nice not to have to look.

Good stuff, though!  A singular experience, but with plenty of replay value.

Game about running a shipping company based around the Panama Canal. Players must take contracts, load goods onto ships and move them through the canal to make money. There is also a rudimentary stocks and shares system. The trick is to have the greatest personal fortune at the end, so you have to syphon money out of your company through various means while leaving enough behind to pay for dividends and shipping taxes. Quite complex, but the parts do mesh together very well and it's not too long either.

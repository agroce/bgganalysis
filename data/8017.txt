{1 play • 4 player} Rating may go up with further play, but for now, I'm mearly intrigued.  We didn't have a lot of "fire ties" so most of our tile placements were forced, making it feel like the game was playing us.  Also, it seems like if you don't get a '1' you're kind of screwed.  Another play or two may reveal something here... but I'm skeptical.  We played with the advanced 'firebreak' rule, by the way.

The game is themed as a forest fire with hotspots, but the game play is fairly abstract.  The tile placement and fire spread is most closely tied to theme and the randomness that comes with the placement leaves just enough information unknown as to make the game play unique and interesting each time.  The lack of information in advance is not a detractor from the game since all critical information is ultimately revealed before players must react / act on it.  Game play is smart and tactical.  Solid play is rewarded more than poor play is penalized.  As for tactics, it is critical to get your fire liine attached to a "1" tile, or the score divider (your lowest number tile) is murder on your score.  This is actually a key to the game that if missed in the first plays really makes the first games unpleasant for the unfortunate player not on a "1".  An interesting game for those that like abstracts.

Simple, surprisingly subtle.  Tile draws are a major luck factor but there's enough control in terms of placement freedom to almost compleatly make up for it.  A common assertion is that the '1' tiles are overpowered.  I've found this mostly experienced players as careful play can very largely contain their effect.

Feurio! appears to be a math heavy game at first, but once you actually begin playing, the maths drop out and the game more or less plays itself. The simulation of a forest fire is very well done, but it is, regrettably, also the game's Achilles' heel. The rules state that you can only add new fire tiles to the places where the sum of the neighbouring tiles is at its maximum: in practice this hardly ever means above two possibilities. Add to this the rule that you cannot add more firefighters than the tile has free edges, and the gameplay becomes very constricted and scripted.

For some reason I feel a bit disappointed about this. The game probably could have supported a different way of placing firemen or adding tiles, which would have made the blocking aspect to prevent others from reaching a very valuable 1-tile much more of a nailbiter. With the current ruleset there is little tension to be had, resulting in a disappointing game experience. I give the game a bit of a mercy point because it executes its subject matter very well; it just doesn't make for a good game.

I've played this a few times recently with a variant suggested by Greg Schloesser--treat all 1 tiles as 2s.  This balances out the luck of the draw considerably and makes for a much tighter game.  Also, you don't need to discard a pawn when playing a fire break tile, making this choice a bit more attractive.

An idea I had which we haven't tried yet is to give each player a 1 tile and discard the rest.  You then have the choice of playing the tile in your hand or drawing and playing what you draw, like Metro.  

My rating for the game moved from 6 to 7 by playing with Greg's variant above.

Excellent short game. I see the issue with the 1's but just because you draw a 1 does not mean you are going to get to use it on your large groups so I don't think it is as big an issue as people seem to think. However, I  do like the idea of the firebreak variant to give you a little more control and will have to give that a try.

Elegant placement game where players are trying to effectively fight a forest fire.  Fire tiles are placed where the fire is hottest, then players can place their firemen onto any valid tile.  Players score points for chains, but the score in the chain is divided by the lowest tile in the score.  Hence, if you don't find a '1' tile, you won't win :)  Nice filler, quality art, and weighty plastic pieces.

RATING: 6
I've played this way more often than my rating suggests.  It's short, simple to explain, quick-playing, yet there are some interesting decisions to be made.  But it ultimately feels like you have too little control, although that fits the theme.  I wish the firebreaks were a more viable option, but they are pretty much never worth losing a turn of pawn placement.  There might be potential for some more strategic variants.

Rating and comments is for a 4 player game with firebear variant. Also we got some rules mixed up, so take it with a grain of salt.

Quick tile laying game at the Carcassone sort of level.  I think the theme of forest fires does come through, saving it from being an abstract.  The designer teaching the game at Essen included the "variant" firebreak rule as a standard part of his explanation - I'd always use it.  Enjoyable.

RATING: 7
Snappy little game that's fun to play, but could have used a bit more fine tuning.  There's a good dose of chaos - as you'd expect in a game about forest fires - but also a bit of tactics and planning ahead.  Use the firebreak rules that are listed as a variant.  In fact, I'd like to find a way to make firebreak plays more viable (less costly).  I've tried allowing them to be played without a lost pawn (with forgoing pawn placement as the only penalty), but that made them a bit too strong.  Perhaps I'll try "toss a pawn out, but you may still place pawns this turn."  I highly recommend distributing a single '1' tile to each player, which he can use once in lieu of drawing normally (but still must place at the hot spot).

The designer has created two other games that can be played with these components. The first, Vulkan, is not very interesting. But the other one, On the Run, is quite good.

I suggest playing On the Run with four players, Feurio with three, and either of them with two.

RATING: 3
Lots of adding and luck, in an area-control game with not quite enough choices to be interesting.

The fire-growth rules do make for a cool texture of information about the future-- you can reason about what MUST happen in the next turn or two, and you can make educated guesses about the future, but areas that have been out of play for a long time can come back unexpectedly if the fire wanes.

But the cost of that is players doing trivial repetitive math, without nearly enough payoff in gameplay.

This is an excellent tile placement/strategic meeple placement game. The way in which the simulated fire spreads is very realistic (the hottest spots spread). Since all players know where the fire can spread (where tiles can be placed) it alleviates some of the issues I have with Carcassonne. Accommodates 1-4 players and comes with a few good variations that increase the replay value. The rules are simple and easy to teach. Comes with nice bits too. *Also see the 'Vulkan' game entry, it is a free game played with the Feurio pieces. Vulcan starts at the end of a game of Feurio or can be played solo.

Theme is based on playing firefighters onto a map. There are 36 hexes, numbered 1 through 6 (six of each). Players add a hex to the highest sum of hexes (to represent fire spreading), then place 0 to 3 firefighters. To score points, add the continuous chain of hex numbers your firefighters occupy, then divide by the lowest valued unclosed edge. Obviously, huge luck of the draw on whoever gets the '1' tiles. Light, easy, kind of cute, can also play this solitare. Perhaps to fix the luck part, give each player a '1' hex (for 2 players, give two '1' hexes each); then a player has a choice of drawing a tile and playing it OR use their '1' hex tile.

This is the flavor of the moment, so it may drop a pip over time, but I am nonetheless impressed with the game.

(First impression, 3 players): I liked the mechanics and they have surprisingly lot of "theme" for such an abstract game. But it seems you might get played out of the competition if 1-tiles avoid you and/or are placed in such positions that connecting them to big points is impossible. Not having connection to outer 1-tile may even halve your points compared to luckier opponents.

RATING: 6
Interesting tactical game based on a simple and clever mechanic to simulate fire propagation - as the fire grows along its hottest spots, players try to put their firemen forming the longest possible chains. These score the amount of points (i.e. the added intensity of the fire in all of their spaces) divided by the points in the weakest fire. This last bit reads better than plays - there are few tiles with a 1, and since they (should) get used just after being laid on the board, scores depend hugely on luck.

50+ plays. A really nice 10-15 minute opener for 3 or 4 players that captures the wild swinging moods of fires beautifully, as does the chain-out rule for the firemen for them to be safe. Too much luck on the 1's, we're all agreed, and occasionally we play that they're 2's, but for this length of time, it doesn't really matter to us. The decision each turn is where to place your firefighters. Do I place here to expand my chain but maybe get blocked in, or expand over there instead for less points but more chance of keeping my connection alive, or over here to stop someone else getting easy points, or I can see the fire going way over that way so let's start a new chain (or create a firebreak). It's a nice decision each turn, not brain burning. You can't take the result too seriously because the 1's are so powerful, and player decisions on pussage can be overly influential, but for a 15 minute opener, it hits good buttons. We also occasionally play the Vulcan game using the same pieces, paratrooping guys into the fire in a line, just to be different.

Three games in one, all quick and playable cooperatively or competitively, 1 to 4 players. The components are nice, and very compact. Based on solo/cooperative play, it's an a somewhat interesting basically-abstract puzzle game with various flavors:

Feurio/Wildfire: Place pawns (firefighters) as fire tiles are laid.  

Vulkan/Volcano: Lay stripes of pawns (water) to remove fire tiles. This one has no randomization after the initial layout, and no hidden information. Starting with the tiles that ended a game of Wildfire makes Vulkan hard, because the low tiles are at the edges.

On the Run: Save critters from the fire. Probably the most interesting game of the three, as you have more choices in tile placement, as well as pawn movement. The co-op is a "best score" rather than a "win/lose", which is a bit less satisfying.

Ok, not even half bad. I know it will never see the table unless it accidentally is the only game I got with me, but at least, if that happens, I know nobody will be really disappointed. Can be a good challenge and the solo game is not too shabby either.

Easy game to learn with only one page of rules.

Original mechanic, but the game does not play smoothly. Worth a try if someone you know has it, just to see a new mechanic.

RATING: 6
A relatively fast paced tile laying game as you are often dictated as to where to place your hexagon. Your real decision is to either place the hexagon value  face up (fire) or face down "0"(firebreak). Interesting theme enhanced by the playing rules, but the charm is lost when you have to do the maths.

Being a fan of quick, easy and fun, I really thought I would enjoy this game.  As it turns out, I almost enjoy it.  It's okay to play with non-gamers... but explaining it to them sucks and  yet, it's not deep enough to play with gamers.

RATING: 5
Nice filler game.  While the fire spread seems mechanical, it does work nicely to simulate the fires movement.  Unlike other comments, we did have enough tied locations to have some input on the spread of the fire, but then again, we also utilize the firebreak variant which can strongly move the fire spread elsewhere (as well as mixing up the tiles in play).

Fast and clever game with a very neat theme. Play with firebreaks, it adds an interesting twist to the game and a way to control the fire. The solitaire version is also a lot of fun. A very cool find!

Simple filler with no real decision. The way the forest fire spreads (from the position where the sum of bordering hexagons is the biggest) simulates actually quite cleverly the spreading of forest fire. The only problem is that that is the only thing going for this game.

RATING: 7
I thought that this game was brilliant when it first came out, but...
The "1" tiles are overpowered and I find that people without "math brains" HATE this one.  I don't feel like the math is overwhelming (it's pretty simple, really), but I've been told repeatedly that I am wrong on this count.

Sadly, the game is broken out of the box.  Whoever draws ones wins.  That said, if you take just say the ones are twos and use the firebreak rule without removing a piece -- the game suddenly becomes a wonderful filler.

It is a shame that people are going to play this and not realize the potential, but it helped me pick it up cheap so I can't complain.

Played once, so employ your Grain of Salt transducer.  
Seems quite random, in an irritating way, and the fire only changes direction two or three times in a game, so there aren't many decisions to be made.  I should probably try this again--there has been discussion of variants that address the static feel of the game.
Update:  Did play one variant that may make it into the next rules set.  Given the quickness:depth ratio, I'm upgrading from 5 to 6.  I'd play it again, but I'd never buy it.

The system the game is based on is very clever although for me theme and game-play is a bit boring. I can clearly see that it is smart design and pretty good game, but it is not inspiring me, so you must try and judge on your own. For lovers of abstract concepts the rating is surely about 6.

Plays better than I expected.  Interesting theme.  Made the bad mistake my first game of deploying all of my firefighters too soon and wound up having them get cut off when the fire shifted.  I could definitely see playing this one fairly often at least for a while.  The game length is short enough that it's hard to resist playing "just one more time."

Cooperative play is more like a multi-player "puzzle" than a game; worth playing just because its different.  Competitive play is fun as well; maintains the puzzle feel, but its quite interactive.

This is not a bad game by any means, but there seems to be a bit of unbalanced play based on the '1' tiles.  It seems that they are very powerful, and a player can be hosed by never getting one.  I love the way the fire grows in the hottest area, it feels very well themed.

When rated [b][bgcolor=#9999ff] 6.5 [/bgcolor][/b]: This is an interesting challenge, with fascinating fire spread.  I prefer [thing=13832]Vulkan![/thing], but it's played with the same nice components, so no problem!

Now: How I could overlook the same sentence every time I read the rules is beyond me.  Playing with the limitation that you can only add firefighters to a hex if it will not put more firefighters in there than there are free sides on the hex... well, it's an enormous difference.  I like this game quite a bit more now!

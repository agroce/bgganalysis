Perfect quick game. I love small box games and Love Letter is one of the best. This version adds a neat mechanic where if you can "find" Finn using the Jake card (or vice versa) you automatically win. Fun addition, love the theme. Great for a warm up, filler, or something to play while chatting.

Nice, quick, light deduction/luck card game for a night when we don't feel like thinking too hard. I love that such a simple mechanic can actually allow for some light strategy.

The artwork is definitely the best of any of the Love Letters that I own, and I like the Finn/Jake mechanism unique to this one, much like the Batman version has its own tweak. In fact, with this one at Bats I am unlikely to play the standard Love Letter anytime soon.

As fun as the original Love Letter. One flaw is that the writing on the cards explaining what they do is small and written in a difficult script for kids to read. Another slight complaint is that some of the cards with more than one version of the same number have different characters, which makes it hard for kids to remember what they do.

Great edition of a great microgame. Prefer the "theme" of this one and the additional winning mechanism of uniting Finn and Jake by forcing one to discard the other. The slightly upgraded components is also a nice plus, but the game isn't distinct enough from the original to credit a different rating - just felt it was a worthwhile addition to my collection due to being a fan of the show, and therefore the artwork etc.

I wanted this just for the theme/art, but was pleasantly surprised with the rule tweaks! This has actually ended up being my favorite version of Love Letter as a result. It's a small thing, but the extra point for having a Companion in your hand adds a fun risk-reward to cards that in every other version of LL, just [i]always[/i] get played.

I haven't actually had the Hero+Hero card thing come up yet and it does seem a little silly and maybe lame to just luck into a win that way, but that's an easy rule to ignore if it bothers me.

Think I may end up gifting my regular ol' Love Letter away now. This version is just tops!

Love Letter sounds like a good game for my fam and for my gaming group. The Adventure Time theme is a sweetener that makes me prefer it over vanilla LL.

Technically this is Angie's. This is a great, quick game that initially looks like luck, but then you notice patterns and improve in the way that you play. Note that the Hero win condition is not worded well in the rule book and we consistently played it that the second person who discarded the Hero would win! It should be the other way around.

I have no idea who any of the characters are in this particular version however I really like the additional rule whereby you 'win' if both heroes are played on your turn. i.e I play the hero causing someone else (or myself)  to discard their card, which happens to be the hero.  
It doesn't change the game play all that much but does add something to the original game.

This game was OK this time around but not great. The first two rounds we had 2 of the 4 people out of the round within two turns of starting. This game constantly screws you over which can become tiring after a while. While playing this game I just feel like i'm just laying cards because there are no real decisions. Particularly early in the game you don't have enough information to make good decisions. When it comes to playing the cards even in the late game you really don't have a choice in which card you play. I guess the game is too simple for my liking.

Perhaps the greatest filler of our generation. Simple, light, and yet rewarding. It can lead to awesome and loud moments of realization and deceit. When teaching it to new players, you can just see the cogs fall into place in their minds before they hit that ah-ha moment and the entire game suddenly makes sense.

I can, and have, played this for hours at a time. While I personally prefer more complex and involved games, this is one of those perfect mixes of simplicity and complexity. It's simple enough that I can teach a new player quickly, random enough that new players can win, but skilled enough that I can still make some skilled plays that give me a slight advantage over a new player. It sort of reminds me of Tsuro and Sushi Go in that regards.

Wouldn't trade this edition for any of the other editions. What's not to love? It's fast, family friendly, with enough meaningful decisions that you can overlook the inherent randomness of the card draw.  

I've played with both fans of Adventure time and those who know nothing about it. For the later, the Love Letter engine is enough to keep them engaged. For the former, they can lapse into songs of "Makin' pancakes" or LSP's valley girl voice on a whim (which can inadvertently give away their card if not careful).

And Jake's pimpin' hat is priceless.

Every re-theme of Love Letter does a little something unique. I'm a big Adventure Time fan, but this Love Letter variant doesn't really do it for me. Sadly, the Batman version is probably still the best.

Love Letter is a great game and I rolled my eyes at all the 'reskins' of it until this version got me. Who doesn't love Adventure Time?

I absolutely love this game! I had never played the original game first but with the help of a tutorial my friends and I got along just fine and played the game for at least three hours straight. I wish I could say I was exaggerating but in our defense this game is super addicting despite it's simplistic nature! The art and design is also really cute and great!

RATING: 7
Well, it's Adventure Time, which the wife loves. And it's Love Letter, which the wife also loves because of the ease of play and transport. Been bringing this out with us when we travel. 

It plays nice up to 4, and is easy to teach. And the nice Finn pouch is definitely eye catching.

I had to get for myself the Lovecraft version because it adds a bit more meat to the game, and can play up to 6.

RATING: 9
Rating has gone from 8 to 9 on this game with the more plays we get. This game is just great to break out for a quick, fun, engaging card game. Simple mechanics yet it's always fun to try to be the last man standing. If you get knocked out, no problem, each game lasts barely 5 minutes. A real joy that can be played anywhere with just about anyone.

As good as the original Love Letter with added Adventure Time fun! The 'love tokens' in this are little gems- a nice touch! 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
An Adventure Time re-theme with Love Letter-esque art work. The included gems is a nice touch to the point system, and there are a WIDE range of characters. Instead of naming a character, the player will be naming the card type. Good way to implement various Adventure Time characters.
Fun re-theme with a slight mod. The Finn and Jake buddy system is a nice touch too.

RATING: 7
It could run dry after multiple plays, but given for it's genre, it's a pretty good game for what it offers - light, easy to teach/learn/carry/setup. For that I'm giving it higher rating.

Although I don't like players deduction game, but the game ends so fast that I actually I don't mind it and find it fun to play with.

Applicable to all Love Letter skins: manages to achieve depth, intrigue, and replayability with just 16 cards.  It's easy for kids and adults to learn, yet hard to grow tired of.

Fun little game. Despite being a simple game, this has some complexity to get to grips with at first and it's quite satisfying to figure out the hidden depths. After 20 or so rounds, though, most players will have figured out all the various combos and tactics then it becomes very luck driven (with the occasional mistake leading to a loss, which leads to much laughter and derision, of course :))

My favourite Love Letter next to Batman (now out of print), I like the buddy element to it as well that you don't need to use if you don't want to. The gems are a cool touch to the win counters as well.

Of all the types of Love Letter that I have tried (haven't played the new Premium version yet), is is the one I enjoy playing the most - both because of the beautiful artwork and the special rule for 'the best buddies' Finn and Jake.

RATING: 7
Quick filler, although unless you play quite a few games there's so much luck that good strategy won't have time to save you.

When you have some time to fill and lack the energy for something meatier, Love Letter is great. It always seems to generate a few laughs or groans. It's certainly quite exciting.

Good for new gamers- simple to teach.

It's a retheming of Love Letter, so it's pretty much on par with that, being a fun, easy to teach, short card game. I do like that they add in other conditions for winning and made the gems rainbow colored.

Very slick mechanisms that are fun to use, but it's too much of a multiplayer solitaire experience for my taste - I'd like it to have a little more player interaction.

Not keen on the plethora of contracts that you have to keep going through the whole deck for, to decide which you might like.  Having three revealed as choices might have been preferable, along the lines of the cards in Alien Frontiers.

I might use the cart mechanism in my next game of Orleans though.

Haven't play Orlean before so I can't compare. But I love this game because there is many way to score and you have to control how many tiles left in your bag to estimate and plan your efficiently every round.

Thoughts after three games, all two player.
This has gone down well with Mrs B and myself, playing in about an hour and 15 minutes.
I've never played Orleans, by the same designer, so can't compare it with that, but it has obvious similarities with deck builders. A key difference here is that you are drawing a certain number of counters per turn and can in effect “park” ones you don't immediately use on your player board. This means that you can plan ahead for a particular combo, it doesn't have to come up in the same hand.
The game amounts to a competition to build the most efficient machine, which you can do by increasing the number of counters you draw each turn, the number of moves your meeple can make between the board locations, or by selling goods for money that can be used to buy additional action options. 
But if you focus too much on these choices you'll fall behind an opponent who's busy using cheap goods to get more valuable ones. These in turn help you to complete order cards and rows in your warehouse. Both these moves can produce lots of VPs but you need to judge carefully when to carry them out, especially early in the game, because doing so will remove the necessary counters from your supply. There are some fine balances to be weighed.  
There's no direct player confrontation but it's not multi-player solitaire – there's competition for the dwindling resources which becomes crucial towards the end of the game as you find yourself needing the last cloth or silver or whatever to complete a high-scoring order card or warehouse row. Your ability to get it might depend on something as basic as having one more food counter, itself worth 0 VPs, that lets you make one more meeple move. That makes for a tense endgame.

Rating increased to 8.5 after more two and four player games. I had to increase it on account of the number of requests to play it's getting.
Some critics have called it multi-player solitaire, and one even said that there was so little player interaction they took their actions simultaneously rather than going round the table. This is wrong. In most games I play you'll hear the cry “I wanted that” as one player takes a card or last resource token wanted by another. Admittedly this is infrequent, but it happens often enough to make it important to plan for something you need.
If it is multi-player solitaire then it is only in the sense that the Olympics 100 metres is multi-player solitaire: the runners might not actually be trying to trip each other but their success is measured against their competitors. Same in Altiplano: there's no take-that, but you'll only win if your engine is working better than that of anyone else.

I had a chance to play this at BGG.con 2017 and I like Orleans, with it's bag-building of cardboard worker discs. When I heard about Alitplano, a similar style game with more going on (more actions, more resources, more developments), that was encouraging. I just didn't feel like the whole idea was terribly inspired beyond the "limited resources" part... in the South American highlands, there is only so much available. You can gather resources and then store those resources in your warehouse for points and once they are in a warehouse, they are out of the game. The scarcity of resources didn't happen until more than 3 hours into the game when it was ending anyway. Ultimately, it was just too long and too repetitive... just not very interesting.

Very boring resource conversion game. Minimal player interaction and very predictable game play.

RATING: 8
I like this one a lot better than its predecessor Orléans! Why?  The available actions in this game seem  more meaningful and interesting to me than in Orléans, where almost every action ultimately just allowed you to push a cube down a track. 

Altiplano is a pretty straight forward resource conversion game and may very well feel dull to others - Glass Road is the perfect example for a game of this kind that just didn't click with me.

I think that Altiplano features a much better implemetation of the bag-building mechanic, which I already liked a lot in Orléans. As suspected, this ranks quite low on the player interaction scale and it's definitely not the most innovative game of all times, but all those moving parts come together very elegantly and keep me engaged the whole game. It is simply satisfying to collect more and more stuff to throw in your little stash and ultimately store on shelves for VPs - the rational gamer in me tells me that it's kind of simplistic, but I really love it!

This is great fun. It reminds Orléans, but has some new mechanics. Player interaction is limited, however there are many paths to victory. Start with variable player powers. Some rules are a bit fiddly (many questions with regards to the money actions), but after a couple of rounds it plays smoothly.
Update: 2-player game. This game is GREAT! Plenty to do. And play is very streamlined.

Orleans' big brother. Takes the bag-building mechanism from Orleans and improves on it by adding buildings to contract, contracts to fill, and a special action market. Becomes a much bigger puzzle to solve, especially with the restrictions in movement. Missing the deluxe components from Orleans but the game looks great and has a cool alpaca first player marker. Player count goes up to 5 but I found that at 5 players, the game went on too long. Would probably be better with 3 or 4. Definitely worth checking out if you liked Orleans or looking to step it up a notch.

RATING: 7
Another great bag building game from Reiner with an awesome theme. This is definitely a step up in difficulty from Orleans for a few reasons. First, having to be on the right island in order to activate the actions can be a mind bender in terms of planning your actions out in the most efficient way. Second, the fact that not all tokens are readily accessible to you means you likely need to find a way to get a few more somehow through either boats or extensions. Third, you need food for just about everything (getting some resources, moving, etc.) but there is no way to thin your bag from food either so too much food will limit you getting some of the better tokens out as often as want. Fourth, needing to balance getting a variety of goods and then thinning them out of the bag to score points in the warehouse is another good challenge to maximize your points. Finally, the asymmetric start is definitely something you should look to use as often as you can too, and in future plays will take you in another direction specializing in different resources which is fantastic and already has me thinking ahead to my next play. Even with all of this going on, the game is fairly easy to teach especially if you know Orleans. Altiplano has a lot of strategy and more planning in it and it makes for a great alternative, I can't wait to play this again.

>The numerous goods — such as fish, alpaca, cacao, silver, or corn — all have their own characteristics and places where they can be used. Whereas silver makes you rich, fish can be exchanged for other goods, and the alpaca gives you wool that you can then make into cloth.

Goods that are actually mechanically differentiated. Rare thing to see in a Euro. I'm intrigued.

After playing, I can safely say that this was pretty much what I expected. I can see how after enough plays, games can feel a bit similar, but I feel there are enough divergent strategies to keep the game fresh for a while.

I love to play this game despite the fact that I never seem to be able to win it. To me, this is was makes a game great - no matter how bad my final result is, I still feel satisfied. Altiplano is easy to learn but provides so many ways to play. The downtimes are moderate, most turns are rather quick. There could be more player interaction - or ANY player interaction, to be honest. Yes, you might grab something that another player needed but that's it. If you don't enjoy multiplayer solitaire, Altiplano is not for you. The game is beautiful to look at, I really like the art and the setting - which is completely arbitrary, of course. In fact, the theme makes so little sense that it has been mocked in every group I played the game with. In what weird world do you "sell" your silver but get to keep the silver? How do you "build a house" while keeping the stone you used for it? "Uh, that's some very nice silver you have there. I'll pay you 3 money for looking at it. I'd pay 2 more if you could also show me some cloth." "Thank you for showing me that fish of yours, have some free fruit to go with it!". This must be the strangest economic system ever.

First we played normally (4p). Then we started taking simultaneous actions after checking that there were no conflict. After 15 more minutes of us all doing multiplayer solitaire, one person suggested stopping and the rest of us agreed.  Not much here for me. Rating is for my enjoyment of the game. If you like multi-player solitaire, your score would be much higher.

Played this with four players this weekend and was impressed by the additional level of planning that was added simply by requiring the player move a pawn into the required area to take an action. Those additional decisions about ordering and when to spend resources on carts to enhance the movement blow away the game play for Orleans. It also means that the game is going to take longer as players AP on the best order or try to remember what order they had in mind during the planning phase. Overall, I think this is a welcome additional challenge to the bag building engine and I would buy Altiplano over Orleans for any collection needing a mid to heavy weight euro.

I haven't really had a strong desire to play this one again since the first play post Essen. The length of time it took for a single play is the one thing that resonates in my mind and there are so many other games that I could play in the same time that I'd like more. I suspect my initial rating was higher than normal because it was the new hotness.

Seems to be the evolved version of Orleans (the base board game experience) with more depth, more victory paths to follow, modularity that is not abstract (as in Orleans) and make sense, variable game end, hidden objectives.

This is essentially a deck building game with an original way of thinning out unwanted commodities--you place them in a warehouse where they stay till the end of the game & scoring.  

This game is one of my favorites because the number of actions has a lot to do with careful planning.  Someone who is careless might get 3 actions out of 4 tokens where as someone else playing those same tokens might get double the actions, or more.

Nagyon jól kitalált, összetett nyersanyag flow, amiben érdekes módon egész játékokban nem jut akár többféle nyersanyag is a játékosoknak. Ez persze elsőre elég fura és frusztráló lehet. Az akciózás a tokenek és helyszínek összepárosítása miatt szintén elég szűkös. Összességében egy elég krízismenedzselős darab, de talán pont ez az ami miatt más tud lenni, mint az orleans. Ott mindenki, mindent tud, szinte bármikor csinálni. Itt viszont minden játék, minden helyzet más, mindig alkalmazkodni kell.Azt nem mondom, hogy jobb, mert tényleg néha kicsit már kellemetlenül beszorítva érzi magát az ember, de mindenképp érdemes kipróbálni, mert más élmény.

RATING: 6
Altiplano basically is Orléans with added spatial restrictions for the various actions. On one hand that's another mechanical embellishment for a game that was already creaking under its own weight, but on the other some things finally intuitively make sense whereas Orléans often expected you to do things for the sake of doing them... and pushing a cube up a track. That the already sparse interaction points have been further removed is most certainly not an improvement but at least the puzzle has gotten a little more interesting. It does feel a somewhat imbalanced right out of the gate, however.

RATING: 8.5
Basically Orleans but with a spatial element.
You draw tokens out of your bag and assign them to actions you want to do, like Orleans. All actions only need 1-2 tokens to execute, and some are quite flexible. Each action relates to one of 7 different locations on the central board (it loops in a circle). To actually DO the action, you must be standing there.
So to buy stuff from the marketplace, you must be standing in the marketplace.
To put stuff in the warehouse, you have to be standing at the warehouse.
To go mining in the mountains, you have to be in the mountains. Etc.
Moving does not take an action, but it takes up a "cart" and/or a "food" (disc). You start the game off with only one cart, so each round you can move ONE time. If you have food allotted to the move action, you can move to a directly adjacent location. (or if you have a second card+food, you can do a second move to anywhere.)

The good thing is if you have more than one market action or whatever ready to go, you just have to get to the place and then you can fire off all those actions before needing to move again. More actions can be bought at the marketplace; each round at least one new action will appear in the marketplace and the older ones will slide down. 

Another interesting thing is how everyone WILL start off with different discs. There will be someone who doesn't have fish, someone who doesn't have a llama, etc. So people will be building different disc generating resource trains, might not ever get all the different types of discs (it's not required), etc. So it's nice. Real nice. Not an Orlean killer, just feels like a solid game using mechanisms that are already familiar.

This is the best and worst game made in 2017. 
I love and hate its design and play-testing is a fail. 
Good stuff:
I love the mechanics, the look of the game and the feel of "deck building". 95% of the game is great, but there is some major faults and errors in the game, and the errors are so bad. 
Bad stuff:
1) All players have the same color of the bag, it happens 2 times during our plays that the bags got mixed between players.  Green player = green bag!
2) No player interaction, i feel when I play the game that i can't change the course of the game and effect the outcome. 
3) Some starting characters are way to powerful. Some may have a starting move with you getting silver for first turn and more  food. Some is "stuck" with only 1 move. 
4) The cards you buy at market has tiny tiny price tags. 
5) Some players may get "locked" out of the game if they dont manage to get a fish or the "lama" early. 
6) After round 2-3 you know who will win the game. 

I WILL buy the game, if it comes a 2nd edition that makes the game more playable. I really hate the Designer for making such at lovely and great game, that sux.  
Some minor improvements will make major improvements in the game. 

1) take out the character that is food->stone
2) Cloth bags that matches the players colors
3) Make the "Player" color stand out more and just not on the "box"
4) Make the tokens 2 sides, one for active and one used, so you can plan your tokens and know witch tokens are locked since the last turn. 
5) In market, make the option for 5 coins to buy 1 resources of any type as long there is stock of it. 
6) Make a clean-up phase, a last phase that lets you put tokens you placed on the board during that or the last turn in the "box". So they don't become locked in the player board. 

I really really want this game to have some improvements done and a 2nd edition.

Szuperjó, mert viszonylag egyszerű a szabályrendszere, de közben meg szétég az agyad az egésztől. :D Hát nem az a típus, amiről egy játék alatt alakul ki a véleménye az embernek, így ez most egy megelőlegezett pontszám és megjegyzés. :)

Frissítés: többszöri próbára is azt mondom, hogy nagyon jó, de ez egy kimondottan hevi játék, legalabbis a játékérzetet tekintve mindenféleképpen (a szabályt továbbra sem érzem bonyolultnak). Egyértelműen rutinos játékosoknak ajánlott.

Initial tought after 1 x 5 player game :

Execute your plans through many babysteps of (mainly) turning A into B.
Expand your possibilities, build that engine, put oil and fuel in it and just as important : 
Complete contracts during play and dump to the warehouse lateron to clean the sand out of it!

Great fun, I like what i'm doing but after a while these babysteps start to feel repetitive, even while it can move around the table at a nice pace it gets a bit boring past the 90 minutes mark and I lose interest past 120 minutes. There is not enough there to warant a longer play. 

Looking forward to more plays but definitely at a lower playercount!

Fantastic upgrade to Orleans. It's so nice to play a game that doesn't beat you over the head or punish you for not playing well. I'm looking ant you Uwe Rosenberg. Altiplano has so many little hidden ways to play and score points.

RATING: 7
4 players. Unsurprisingly similar to Orleans in terms of mechanics but different enough to make it a separate gaming experience. My favourite aspect is that you only return the discards when your bag is empty meaning you have a better idea of what will be picked next, allowing you to plan better.

Fun to play and I expect each starting character offers a different focus/strategy, focusing on Lamas, fish, rocks etc. I just hope that all these characters are balanced which repeat plays will answer.

Note: The orders felt weak as the goods used to complete them account for a majority of the points the order offers whereas stashing in the warehouse offers an increasing point bonus.

Certainly in my current hot 10 games (17/12/17) , getting a lot of enjoyment from this one, better at its full player count but obviously a longer game for that. Resource management and what some call "bag building" but I prefer the term "bag management" as you can frequently weed the counters you collect, there are many ways to victory and I have tried several routes and a little bit of everything seems to be the way. If you like resource management games where nothing is certain you should be pleasantly surprised by this one.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Appears to be a solid engine/bag building game. The warehouse strategy is very strong if done correctly and the game goes on long enough - we were destroyed by over 50 points by a person who hit it hard. I suspect the warehouse needs to be hit with a certain strategy by everyone even if they pursue other strategies to keep the gap close but who knows, there's a fair bit to explore. Fairly easy to explain but games can overstay its welcome although my first game flowed fairly quickly.

Inspired by Orleans, this game also turns around "bag management". Quite a solitary game that takes to long for what it is, transforming resources in other resources, over and over. There is almost no player interaction except when resources are close to being finished. 
I didnt get bored by the game because there is a lot to plan for during each turn but you don't know how you are doing as opposed to your opponents. The verdict comes at the very end and can be quite surprising. The game seems very balanced no matter which route you take.

After only one gMe which was very much a learning experience I am keen to play it again.
It takes a lot to get your head around the fact that there are VERY limited ways in which to gather base goods which can then be converted into more valuable goods. So you have to play to your starting tile strengths.
In some ways the game is a bit of a point salad as there are many ways in which to gain VPs.
My real concern is over the runtime of the game and I would not want to play with more than 3 players in order to try to keep the runtime to under 2 hours.

RATING: 8
This is really Orleans 2.0. It’s different tough, because it has a spatial aspect that limits your actions per turn and you get to draw every disc from your bag before you reshuffle. This way it really feels like your Discs represent goods instead of people. Furthermore you are thinking about totals instead of probabilities while playing because you know that you get to see every disc. I was able to collect almost all glass resources, got a bonus on them too and filled 5 or 6 of my columns in my warehouse. I won our (complete) game which really felt epic.

 Early rating 7.5 to 8 (My friend Michael rated it a 10.).

All the good ness of Orleans with a little less theme.  The mechanisms are where this game shines.  Everything is very mechanical and allow you to build a strong engine.  There is also less luck since you empty your bag out before refilling as opposed to Orleans.  Orleans is still my preferred version, but this game still fits the bill.

A mixed bag (har har). Stripped down in comparison to Orleans, in that it's both less thematic and less likely to generate big combos or exciting turns. The event tiles in Orleans are one thing that's sorely missed here, and the "map" play is not very compelling at all. There's very little direct interaction or outside interference to mess with your plans (even the changed bag shuffling rules even out the luck of the draw), which makes this senseless as a game for more than 3 players. 

... and yet, I found it a fun little puzzle. Many people complain that this feels too long, but I appreciated that it's the rare engine builder where you can fully exploit the engine that you've designed (to the point where you're likely to run out of available resources if you aggressively collect a type). The asymmetric setups are a huge plus as well, presenting you with a scenario that you must scheme your way out of from the start.

Really like the process of building your bag and the way you have to consider how you deal with each of the items that you collect as you will see them once through each bag.

The movement of your avatar is also a nice puzzle that makes it hard to do everything that you want to do in a turn.

Not Orleans 2.0 since it lost its player interaction completely and added the meeple.

Dislike: lost player interaction, game slowed down because of the moving of your meeple and you need a strategy from the start or you will fall behind quickly. 
Likes: you need to plan ahead because you have to move the meeple before you can use the action, love the artwork and Alpaca and a better drafting system then Orleans.

RATING: 8
Altiplano is the second game by Reiner Stockhausen that uses the "bag-building" mechanic. This time, it's attached to a resource-conversion game with some contract fulfillment and some multipliers. The most ingenious part of the game is that each of the action spaces is associated with a particular island, and you have to move your pawn between the islands to utilize those actions. There are a number of special conversion tiles that can be added to the actions of a particular island, including ones that you start with and others that you can buy during the game. Most resources are worth points by themselves, but they can be turned in for bigger-point contracts, or have their values increases through house cards. Additionally, they can be stored in sets in the warehouse for more bonus points. I really love the planning involved in making sure your pawn is positioned correctly to execute your actions, and the special conversions were a great way to customize your strategy and make everyone feel like they do different things. I really had a lot of fun with this one.

The game features a really wonderful planning board. Enormous fun to use, it's a clear way to plan your movements and use of resources. 
The bag-building is fun and offers a nice challenge (when to expand and when to reduce).
In spite of having 13 different resourcers the game board and the options are quite clear. 
Unfortunately, the game is non-interactive point-soup..

So, the comparison to Orléans is obvious, but thus far, it's not gonna convince me to choose it over the gem that is Orléans.

I have a very vague recollection of how Orléans plays, but I sort of like Altiplano in its own right. This is a fairly light and quick game despite the abundance of tokens and boards on the table. In Altiplano, players use combinations of resources to take actions. But instead of consuming them, these resources are temporarily discarded and pulled out of a bag at random at the beginning of each round.

There is a neat little logistical puzzle in moving your player piece from area to area, and a tech tree of sorts for resource specialisation. I also like how culling the resource tiles from your bag becomes a minigame to score more VP. The major downside is that Altiplano is a largely solitaire affair, and it is common to have a few players planning their next round while others are still taking the actions of the current round.

This is a LOT like Orleans, with even less interaction (only in a race to grab disappearing discs or cards) and more bag-thinning tools built into your player boards. I liked it, maybe even more than New Orleans (though I don’t love that one anyway). This seems like a kinder gentler version.

Pleasantly streamlined evolution of the bag-building/disc placement mechanism from the designer's previous games Siberia and Orleans. It's very smooth, and with refreshingly few "paths to victory": players mostly use goods discs to produce different goods discs, going into bags which can then be thinned out into warehouses or onto contracts. The goods themselves are worth points, so there's no unnatural VP-conversion step; players want to produce the best goods, efficiently, and want to warehouse them as much to keep useless glass and fabric out of the production engine than because of the points.

There's a little more to it, of course, such as a track determining the number of discs pulled back, purchase building tiles adding new location spaces and so on.

Not quite multiplayer solitaire, but close, and like Orleans appears likely to run long at higher player counts - have heard tales of 3 hour games with 5 players. With fewer it's on the good side of inoffensive: wouldn't seek it out, but as a bit of social efficiency-puzzling it's pleasant and low friction.

Altiplano is interesting but not gripping. The chit-pull system is definitely reminiscent of Orleans, and even adds a small improvement - all goods get drawn from the bag before being recycled, ensuring that you'll see everything at some point (in Orleans, with the bag being refilled each round, you could have some critical tiles that just never make an appearance. I like that the player starting resources are asymmetrical and prod players down very different paths and play styles. Ultimately, I like the game enough to happily play if someone suggests it, but I didn't enjoy it enough to want to add it to my collection.

There were a lot of interesting decisions to make.  I don't think I have a good grasp on how to build an engine in this game, so I need to play it some more.

Played twice now. Really enjoying the puzzle of this game to maximise scoring. Unlike some others I do not find it too long, nor over staying its welcome.

First play took about 3.5 hours with 4 players, set up, and rules explanation.  I hope to get this down to 2 hours, otherwise, Orleans will hit the table every time instead.

If this had wooden components instead of wimpy cardboard discs, I might be seduced. But in the absence of that, I'm thinking this might be a little heavy / AP inducing / long for us. Rahdo played a long time before anything really happened. Orleans might be good enough for us.

Altiplano is a bagbuilder similar to Orleans... but instead of focusing on workers in your bag, this game focuses on resources in your bag.

Different players start with different starting resources in their bag. On your turn you draw from your bag up to your draw limit and then allocate the resources on your player board. Any resources that are on your player board but don't get triggered just stay there until you use them, at which point they go into a discard bin. Only after you've drawn all the chits out of your bag do chits from the discard bin return to your bag. So you're guaranteed to draw all your bits.

One of the big differences in this game is that you must move your player marker to the correct location to use your resources. For example, you can only spend 2 food to get a wood resource chit on the forest island. You have a base movement of 1-3 that can be used once per turn. There's four more spaces on the board where you can spend a food to move one spot, or if you upgrade the space with a cart, spend the food to move 1-3 spaces. There's a lot of different resources and many of the actions are about how to get more resources or to work your way up a resource chain.

There's a market action where you can sell up to two things for cash. You can also buy tiles from a market of action spot tiles. These will often allow you to produce resources you otherwise couldn't. And there are some tiles with special abilities. You can also take contracts here. Later on you can ship to those contracts from this spot (but again only 2 resources at a time). Contracts give you points (more than the base resource is worth by itself) and corn (more on that later).

There's another action spot where you can simply buy a resource token, but there's only one token of each type, so if someone else gets there first, you're out of luck. This is another way to get tokens you otherwise can't produce.

All goods (except the ones you commit to contracts) are worth some value at the end of the game. There's an action spot that let's you augment the value of some type of good (but again there's only one per resource type).

You also have a warehouse where you can ship goods. This locks those tokens in the warehouse removing them from your bag drawing cycle. The warehouse is odd. Each row of the warehouse gives you points if you completely fill the row. Higher rows are worth more points. Once a row has been started, the row must continue with the same type of good you started it with. You can't start a new row with a good, until any previously started rows with that good have been completed. Corn is a wild good (unless you start a row with corn and then that row must be corn). You don't have to finish any row to start building a row above it... you just have to have at least one good in the previous row beneath it. Which means you could have six rows with only a single good in them supporting upper levels where you fill out four goods in those rows.

There's also an action spot that advances on a track that alternatively increases your bag draw size or gives you corn. I got too caught up in not taking corn at the wrong time and so crippled my bag draw size.

You keep taking turns doing one thing (and moving as necessary to do that thing) until everyone passes. Then a new round starts. The market tiles are a game timer. If no one buys a market tile, the lowest one is discarded. When you can't fill the market, you finish that round and then have one final round. Most points win.

I enjoyed this game. It's definitely longer than Orleans. I think maybe it's a bit too long with four players. I'd want to try it again with 3 probably. I liked it more than Orleans. There's less of a map/area/route building aspect than Orleans, and there's a lot more flexibility. The number of goods and how you can choose your own way to get points made it feel a bit like Ora et Labora for me.

Altiplano is going to be popular but not from my hype. I've rated it a 5. I had Orleans and played it five times or so but tired of it quickly and sold it. Too little player interaction and not a lot of variation from play to play. Altiplano has even less player interaction since there is no board where you move your people around. Instead it has six boards arranged in a circle. Each board has some actions connected with it - both on your private programming board and on the extensions you buy for it with more action spaces on them. What is different here from Orleans and an improvement is that you can only take an action if your meeple is on the corresponding central board. 

You start with one cart that allows you to move around the board for free but only up to three spaces once. If you want more movement you need more carts. And you want more movement so you can take more actions but for that you need to pay 1 food per movement. And here's my other major problem with the game. In Orleans your action programming tiles were people so it made sense you kept having them in your arsenal but here they are resources including food and llamas so when you pay food or trade cloth for money you don't lose the resources. That makes absolutely no thematic sense. 

In Altiplano you do not put your used and newly acquired discs into the bag but put them into a container that acts like the discard pile in a deck-builder so you do not empty that into your bag again before the bag is empty. That's cool but also very easy to forget we saw. The game has more different types of resources, I.e. types of discs than Orleans so it can be harder to get that one you need but it also means there are more different strategies to follow. But by this they have sacrificed player interaction as it becomes more multiplayer solitaire. You get points for resources, built houses and boats and for filling resources into your warehouse and thereby thinning your bag. 

Player order is decided by who finishes programming first. The only interaction where player order matters is when someone is buying a card from one of three stacks on the central boards as there is no overlap of if buying an extension from the extension market. With four downtime is immense and the game feels quite procedural so you feel you waste time by waiting for others to go through that. 

It's not a good game I think.

I think I prefer Orleans to this. 
I do like the discard pile for chits ensuring that you will see chits every time through your bag better here, and the removing chits from your bag for VPs is also done perhaps slightly better here, but I think the overall game comes together better in Orleans except for maybe a couple of buildings (which can be left out of Orleans).

Strategy bag building chit puller making a life and prospering on the high plains of the Andes.  Harvest corn and cacao, net fish from Lake Titicava, and raise alpaca.  Planning of programmed actions on personal player boards is vital and will be frustrated by opponents snatching a perfect limited building expansion or set collecting goal.  Storing goods for end game points is a unique puzzle for thinning the bag in later rounds.  Lots of paths to take; build road for more actions, manage what chit actions to add to bag pulling, manage food to solve the worker movement puzzle for efficient actions.

Beautiful game, interesting resource transfer, but almost completely solitaire. This may be good for some, but I would love to see other people's actions inform my decisions more. I really want to like this...but I don't.

An obvious sibling to Orleans but with a fair number of changes - some better, some worse. Loved the randomised board, and the addition of your container (a discard pile) made a big difference - meant you *will* see all your tokens as the game goes on. However, without the negative event threat everything is very positive, and it becomes a bit of a friendly 'point salad' where the only competition comes from who can do something before you (for example, buy a building). And there's very little else you can do to influence the other players, sadly. It's still very good though and a great addition to bag building - I only hope it receives the support that it's older brother does

I like the change that you go through your whole bag (deck) once before redrawing. I'm still highly annoyed that not drawing the disc you need can have a huge effect, though maybe less than in Orleans. (Not sure why that annoys me so much with these bag builders... but it does.)
Playing time is long, and the player order is not important most of the time, except when it is, which makes the game longer than necessary.
I like the art, though in our copy (from SPIEL'17) many of the tokens and boards were badly centered.

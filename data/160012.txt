A great party game, really good for gamer's and muggles alike. The junior version gets played a lot in my house, also in the car when were stuck in traffic or anywhere where we have 5 minutes.

I have witnessed the whole progress of the game as Bez' friend. In the first versions the game was more complicated and there were difficult binds not possible to do for some people. Then the game has become more balanced and fun after new ideas and almost 1 year of playtesting. Now it's in a perfect shape. I take the game to play with my friends when possible. It's probably the silliest and funniest card game I have ever played!

One note game, good for some initial laughs, then gets tedious and boring.

Do what the card tells you to do and don't be the first to fail, with each card adding to the previous. One and done.

I've played this once with my wife and two daughters (8 and 10 years old).  It took a bit to get the group into it, but we had fun watching people try to draw a card while contorted in goofy ways.  My 8 year old thought it was okay and my 10 year old absolutely loved it.  The game is right up her alley with silliness abounding.  My wife is usually all about these kinds of games but this one didn't click for her.  I had a lot of fun.  So, I'll try it again with others, but a mixed bag of reviews after just one play so far.  One issue was that the cards I printed are delicate and this game needs sturdy cards.

Overall, though, it worked fine with cards printed on card stock.  It seemed a bit too difficult to keep touching the cards "in hand" while dealing with the binds... just a little too quick to get knocked out.  We got to three or four and that was too many (and we were fairly easy on enforcing the rules).  It's definitely worth another go... we'll see how it goes.

Slow and Sadistic game variant is one of the most funny and original party games I've come across. It's manages to deliver a level of juvenile fun that far surpasses that other party style card games without having to delve into the offensive or crass. Its always a joy to see games that engage you physically as well.

My rating is naturally biased because I designed the game myself. It's my baby. 

I honestly believe that this is the rating I would give the game were it someone else's though. 

I enjoy twister. Not particularly for the physical contact but for the dexterous challenge and the comedy inherent in watching others struggling at their limit. 

My game uses 53 unique instructions for far greater variety (both of poses for viewing and of challenge when playing) and a far greater number of binds can be placed upon you for continuing escalation of difficulty. 

With so many cards, you can tailor the deck so everyone can play - I once played a game that was won by a wheelchair user!

Not a game to be played for hours - your body will get tired! - but I'd basically always enjoy a game or two.

In terms of art: again, I'm biased but I am somewhat proud of some of the strange animals and figures. I am also proud that I had a good representation of all genders and races. 

I think it would look better with a splash of colour and one card is sadly messed up (the art is correct but the text says 'right' rather than 'left'). 

Despite that, I think the game is brilliant. These are 54 cards that are all intelligible and all - in theory - possible in conjunction. I am proud of that.

Major props to Forest Bower, who pointed out the one final possible simplifications. Slow and Sadistic is great fun with the 'take that' element but the new, simpler, default mode is friendlier and actually purifies the game somewhat, letting nothing interfere with the challenge of physical contortion (except the luck of the draw).

I played this once at UKGE and really enjoyed it, a lovely little party game with a dexterity element. Ok so its more of a dexterity activity with a game element but its competitive and fun. What more could I want.

Before you read this comment put your left elbow higher than your head, your left foot above your right arm, touch your neck with a finger and then take a card to play on someone else. This is a great game. It is powered by innocent pleasure, farce and comedy. I want to play this game right now.

This is a comment about the beta print and play version of the game without expansions (kickstarter reward):

Had a good time playing it - very good game for a playful mood and to take some funny pictures. 
However, having played a few times already, it does tend to become kind of tiring and will go in the shelf for a while before I pick it up again.

Still had some laughs every time I did pick it up again, though.

Also, I find it very fortunate that my version is print and play: sometimes some binds lead to awkward positions with cards getting bent, and that would upset me should the game be retail version.

UPDATE (06-2016): almost a year through, and this game still gets played on occasion, mostly as a filler when playing with children and adults together. Everyone has fun :)

Good dexterity game with the right crowd. You have to work your way through the deck, completing the challenges as you go. Most challenges win. A funny twister style game but using cards instead of a Mat. I would imagine it would be brilliant after a few drinks.

Title is very aptly chosen. Silly, but after a few turns most people cannot help but become fanatic at winning this silly game.

Fun Fun Fun with a capital F. 
This is a cracking game guaranteed to make you fall about with laughter every time you play it. After all how can balancing a card under your nose whist touching your right ear with your left index finger not be fun?
Thoroughly recommend this game to anyone looking for a party game.

Played this for the first time in a hotel lobby during UKGE...a simple game, but great fun! We ended up with another 5 random passers-by joining in!

I have the pleasure of knowing Bez, the designer of In a Bind and have witnessed his efforts to bring his idea to fruition over the last few years. I was delighted to receive my Kickstarter copy of the final production and see it making its way into stores. 

And it's a blast! Think Twister but without having to get up from the table. Each turn you receive a 'bind' card (e.g. 'left thumb pointing up', 'this card touching your elbow') and must satisfy that card's demands along with all the previous ones you've accumulated. If you fail for even a moment, you're out; last person standing wins. Those really are all the rules - Bez has gradually chipped away everything that didn't contribute to the core fun of the game and is left with something brilliant, silly and hilarious. Bravo!

I admit that I wouldn't voluntarily choose to play this game, but the execution is excellent and it deserves to be picked up by a big publisher.

When you give a game to non-gamers and they tell you they had a good time it speaks of the clever design and well thought out gameplay.

Brilliantly simple idea, one of those games everyone wishes they thought of, Bez is a lovely person and has designed something brilliant. I'm convinced a big publisher will pick this up eventually and I'll get to be a board gaming hipster.

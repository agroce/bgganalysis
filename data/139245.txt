Interesting, heavy and somewhat counter intuitive, it's a game which I would recommend to the heaviest of Euro-gamers. Hard at first to understand how to score and optimize, also very long, but in a way pretty cool. Would try one more time.

First play. Predictably with Spielwerxxx the rules needed considerable effort to work through the mistake and omissions. Not to mention the need respray the 30 pink cubes to make them purple. Predictably with Spielwerxx once you clear this hurdle the game is sublime.

This game is close to be good. The game barrows mechanics from Targi, Carson City and other worker placements and suburbia. But it fails doing anything exciting. You can tell the game is made from an amateur designer that havent done his research 100%. What the game lacks is invitations to different strategies. Lets lock at caverna, Carson City Suburbia that also uses spatial buildings to give effects. Those games are light years ahead in terms of design. In Carson city a building give bonuses for building next to others (hotel) other give bonuses for being alone (ranches) Some bonuses for being close to mountains. This mix of bonuses introduces tension in the game. But in Diluva project all buildings are the same... There is no variation so you do the same, and repeat. This game doesnt bring anything new to the table and does things worse than games prior it. 

I would have wanted buildings that gave bonuses for being close to gardens, turbins, close to other buildings, being alone and much more.. At least there could have been mechanics like Caylus or Ginkagopolis where you build on buildings you built to improve them. So in this game  everyone builds the same kind of buildings whit no differentiation but there is no way of making your buildings unique... So the game ends up being mathy and misses the opportunity to have tension and lacks replay-ability. 

In addition the worker-placement spots can have several workers at them so there is no tension in placing your workers since you can always do what you want. Bad bad design! This game feels like a frankensteins monster from someone that took mechanics from other games, didnt understand that mechanics needs to support theme and why they where used in the first place. Why is there 4 different cubes in the game? Because i stole that from Caylus... In caverna, Caylus, Agricola Stoneage, all resources feel different and are grounded in theme. when you get cloth in Caylus you can use it for different things and it differentiate from meat. In this game the resource cubes are just different colors because they are... This game badly needs an expansion. This could have been a solid game but fails.

Playing this game made me wish i was playing the Great Zimbabwe or Carson City

Initial Impressions:
---------------------
This one was a bit odd to play, but had some really interesting aspects.  The bidding for tiles on the 4 x 4 grid is really neat, and probably my favorite part of the game.  The area control aspect was a little less appealing, and even in a 4 player game felt a little too open.  Everyone also basically ran out of cubes late, which made the 7th round very uninteresting.  Need to make sure we didn't miss anything, but while this one did have some potential, I think overall it was a bit disappointing.

10/29/15 - Essen 2015 - initial rating from the first 2er game. Even though I lost miserably I could see the mistakes I made and am looking to correct them in the next session. Need to strike an even balance among moving up the prestige and cash early on without disregarding the need for gaining those extra workers. Also, need to pay attention to turn order which can really help to gain some needed market tiles.

RATING: 5
Some interesting ideas here, mainly the scoring system. In this game, there's a scoring system whereby every 10 "points" (let's call them "fake" points) you score triggers a scoring of your "real" points. To start the game, you only score 1 "real" point for every 10 "fake" points, but you'll hopefully increase that number throughout the game. So, you need to build a good engine to score "fake" points since every 10 of them triggers a scoring of "real" points, but you also need to make sure you increase the number of "real" points you score every time you set off that trigger.

I also enjoyed the engine building aspects of the game. Each turn, you have the opportunity to buy tiles from a market that will give players various special abilities, and you'll also build buildings throughout the game that give you turn-by-turn income in various types of resources.

Other than those two elements that were interesting, you have a fairly standard worker placement game, where you'll gather resources, claim land, and use those resources to build buildings on that land you claimed.

Now, I really enjoyed this for a little over half the game. The problem was, I felt like you just repeated the exact same process over and over: get some cubes, claim some land, build buildings. And for this, it just felt like the game overstayed its welcome, and got boring by the time it was over. There were a few other actions to take, but the meat of the game boiled down to this, and it just didn't feel like enough to sustain interest for the number of turns it lasted.

A very odd feeling in that I really dug the game at first, but by the end, felt like a game I didn't really want to play again.

The first play of this game gave me a headache and wasn't much fun. We spent hours in the rule book and on the bgg forum looking for answers to rule questions. Our first game of Twilight Struggle was easier. After spending some more time in the rule book and on bgg, the second play-through was much better. It is a tense, fighty, thinky game. Component quality is great, but yes, they should have included more cubes in each player color. The art is nice, and the theme is fun and makes sense with the game. We paid quite a bit for it, but it is such a solid, well made game that I don't feel ripped off. I'm glad to have this one in our game collection.

An interesting worker placement game of developing a cloud city. Nothing groundbreaking, but also nothing broken. The core mechanics are interesting and the game pleasing to play and look at. I have doubts over the long term replayability. Spielworxx seem to want to set themselves up as on a par with Splotter, but are more like an exclusive WYG. Some major fails in presentation though. Player cubes red, resource cubes red/pink. Comically oversized round marker. Each player colour as a "lighter" disk as stated in the rules, but the light yellow piece is brown and the light red piece is orange.

The scoring is super fun. 

The game has enough heft to allow me to make enough mistakes that I can try to play better in the future. It looks fantastic and it has table presence. 

It seems to easily work well with two players. 

There are different strategies to try.

I have only tried games like Suburbia in the city building group of games. I like this better than Suburbia.

I like how my player board shows a city with different strengths and weaknesses versus my wife's player board and then I like comparing those two in the way that the game tallies scores. 

As someone that firmly enjoyed the land on 10 idea in Sunrise City, I declare this scoring system to be perhaps more fun and interesting to play with and thankfully not so lucky.

I respect it a lot. I haven't played much like this though. You get high marks from me. I would ask to play it:

more than Innovation at the present time
more than Imperial Settlers
equal to as much as Shipyard
not quite as much as Orleans or Bruges

Maybe my rating could change over time if I tire of it more. I doubt I will.

I got my money out of it that I paid for it easily, and I paid $85 total including shipping if that matters to anyone for purposes of picking it up for US distribution. 

I like the kind of city building game that it is. It is not my turn to pick a game today but it will also be my next pick so I can "play it all of the way right and reevaluate the feel of the game".

I think what will hold this rating somewhat steady is I find the steps of the game fun, just the process of playing, even if I gain only a tiny amount of skill at the game or perhaps maybe just play a lot the same way over and over.

I have a horrible memory and some learning issues.

Time will tell.

Ps: for as much as people complain about cube colors and running out of cubes I could tell it was designed by someone in the usual euro area, I could tell it wasn't as cheap as the mass produced games we usually get, and it looked and felt unique. It did feel expensive and more interesting than the usual fare. I had no problems with my pink instead of purple cubes. I wished for slightly more player cubes but it wasn't such a big deal. At least you spent money on the board and the artwork and on good quality cardboard plus a proper die cutting machine so that the pieces punched out nice.

It wasn't kickstarter gameplay

It wasn't American level artwork or an American level board. It was specialty artwork and a large specialty board

It was euro quality. Maybe not La Venise Du Nord level euro quality but still euro quality. Even that pink color for the cubes. I see it none in any of my American games. And I like it. Oh and I can easily see the deep rich dye color on the green wood pieces when compared to your average printed for America game.

That is my two cents.

11/18/15

Dilluvia Project with the correct rules. Let us just say that building the 5 age buildings, with the build 4 age or 5 age buildings for 2 less of any cubes market tile, is definitely a good combination. Cara used it among other things, as this is a busy game, and made 88 on the score track. I made only 58 and the only thing I was better at for a little of the game was making money. It feels like a fighty two player quiet burn game like Luna. We think it is really good. I would say top 5 I have ever played. Cara would say 8.5/10. Nice gamers game with plenty of math and hoping and little decisions and literally hordes of little details to remember to do right just to play the game as it is intended to be played. We are now satisfied and ready to move on to more modest less intensive fare.

This is the heaviest, most complex game we play and still enjoy as of this date.

I feel like a lot of my other city building games that I have not yet tried such as Big City and Urban Sprawl, will lose so hard to the niceties and extra added fun parts of Dilluvia Project. Very glad I picked it up.

Final verdict: not built for two players per se but very playable with two, and too hard to get to the table. The competition is just too fierce. I had to let it go.

Spielworxx had been through a golden period with brilliant game after brilliant game (La Granja, Ruhrschifffahrt 1769-1890, and Kohle & Kolonie to name but three). But 2015 saw them nosedive. First the dreadful Haithabu and now this piece of mediocrity. Dilluvia Project is about acquiring cubes and building stuff. That could be a recipe for a fine game but in this instance it is bloated, long, and fiddley. Worse the rules are poor. Our first game was a third of the way through before we realised we had been playing fundametally wrong as the rules were so ambiguous.

Furthermore it is difficult to catch an early leader due to the rich getting richer in points and money via the regular income track. Throw in some balance issues with some of the market tiles and you end up with a game which needed further editing and development.

So, it is a dry, long, serious Euro, and as such playing it is rewarding on some levels, but there are so many better alternatives.

Just excellent.
Worth the advance investment to understand scoring:  when to advance on the player boards and when on the main track.  
The icons do differentiate and are pretty clear once you read each one ... but it can take a round or two to get the relationship between the two (and the value of moving each one).    Player aids would facilitate early plays.
Would expect rating to move up in future.  Great game.

2016-12-06: Very interesting game! I liked it quite a lot but it was very long! It took us approx 4h15min for rules+game.

It seems to be very easy to get hosed in this game without any good means to catch up which drops the rate a bit. And the length. And the crappy rulebook which explains no fringe-cases (the timing of 'Does this happen before I do this?' can change a lot in the scores!). And the components are badly mismatched to the corresponding illustrations in the rules, and some components are just 'extra' and no-one knows what to use them for, and there are too many resource-cubes and to little 'ownership'-cubes and so on and so on.

But still, I rate it as high as 7. . .

I can see why this scores so low  - the game designers failed to supply enough player pieces.  

They also claimed to supply purple markers, they were all pink; virtually the same shade of pink as the "red" markers supplied for the player.  
They also claimed to supply brown markers.  These - of course - were an off shade of white.  Both items have been replaced with decent cube colours from BOARD GAME EXTRAS.  And very promptly.

Production and art need fixing as others have said.  Build up is nice but since it rewards for specific building order, I don't see this game as very replayable.  Nice take on the "super worker" and use of the grid for resource gathering although it feels disconnected.  The secondary points keeps the scoring interesting but probably is best left out for a more streamlined experience.

Length: appropriate, not long for what the game offers
Opinion: I loved the game, is more worker placement but with something different. You have a positioning on the market and then several actions where to place your workers. You have to decide where to go and how many workers to place, as you can place more than one if you need that action to be executed more. Also you have a special worker giving you bonuses if you place it before anyone else. Did I mention the building in the board? You have to "buy" places to put your buildings, but you have many options for building in order to follow different strategies

Interesting worker placement and resource handling game.
I would have rated it one step better if the resources had been enough.
At least 10 more markers per players plus the purple resources, where red (like one of the player colours). The publisher tried to send corrections, but he apparently didn't have any purple cubes.

Opinió després de una lectura de regles: euro de col·locació de treballadors i construcció de una ciutat mitjançant losetes. Es juga en 7 torns, i cada torn es fan tres fases:
- Fase de mercat: mitjançant una graella de 4x4 losetes, els jugadors obtenen losetes que donen beneficis especials, recursos, etc...
- Col·locació de treballadors: cada jugador col·loca mínim un treballador en un dels llocs disponibles (si en col·loques més pots fer la acció millor). Els llocs et donen recursos, diners, ordre de torn, comprar parceles de la ciutat (tipus Carson), construir edificis, etc... Quan construeixes un edifici col·loques un cub del teu color sobre ell en un dels dos llocs disponibles (cada lloc et dona un benefici diferent, després es pot canviar fent una acció determinada).
- Fase d'ingresos: cobres recursos/diners/PVs en funció dels edificis i losetes que tinguis.

Una mica decepció, esperava alguna cosa més. El mercat pot tindre la seva gracia per la forma en que es reparteixen les losetes, però és una part molt petita del joc. Els edificis surten en ordre en funció del torn, de manera que el joc es pot fer repetitiu. La interacció és molt limitada, cada jugador es pot fer el seu "barri" i evitar trobarse amb els demés... Una llastima, ja que el joc tenia molt bona pinta tenint en compte l'editorial i el tema.

I quite enjoyed this!  It's a city-building game with a multi-step building process, and an area control aspect. It has a grid-based market similar to Hermagor, which I'd honestly like to see a lot more, and I'm pretty intrigued by the multiple implications of your buildings.  One play definitely wasn't enough to plumb the depths and I'd love love love to play it again. (1 play)

Buen juego de gestión de recursos/colocación de trabajadores de la gente de Spielworxx. Creo que será conveniente jugar partidas un poco espaciadas en el tiempo.

Se trata de construir una especie de ciudad en las nubes. Cada jugador irá colocando sus trabajadores en una serie de localizaciones que le permitirán conseguir recursos, dinero, cambiar el orden de turno y construir edificios (hay de diferentes tipos y tamaños) en un tablero central que. Una vez construidos al inicio del turno proveerán de un income (materiales de construcción, dinero y más trabajadores) o bien de prestigio (que es una especie de puntuación) Esto está bastante chulo porque  en la parte inicial-media de la partida interesan más los recursos y el dinero que el prestigio, que es mucho más interesante hacia el final (por la forma de puntuar). El cambio de tipo de producción no se hace cómo y cuando se quiere, sino que cuesta acciones realizarlo.

La forma de puntuar es bastante curiosa ya que hay un track individual de cada jugador donde se va marcando el número de casas que ha construido. Por otro lado hay otro track (prestigio) en el que cada vez que el jugador supera una decena, puntúa en función del marcador de casas que tiene. Por lo tanto, prestigio es interesante avanzarlo cuando se han construido unas cuantas casas, ya que si no puntuaremos, pero muy poco.

Otro punto interesante del juego está al inicio del turno. Sobre una rejilla de cuatro por cuatro donde se colocan unas losetas con unos beneficios, en orden de turno, cada jugador coloca su ficha de dirigible marcando una columna o una fila. Sobre esa columna o fila y por orden de turno podrá comprar dichas losetas con dinero, y evitando que otros jugadores que hayan seleccionado esa casilla la compren a su vez. Estas losetas son dinero, recursos y acciones especiales, muy necesarias para ir adelante en la partida.

Finalmente, hay un tipo de estructura que se puede construir los jardines, que sirven para puntuar al final de la partida en función de tus edificios colindantes. Esto hace que la construcción en el tablero sea muy importante también.

RATING: 7
[floatleft][ImageID=2602443][/floatleft]The game is played over 7 rounds, each round there is a market phase, action phase, and income phase. The market phase involves players choosing a row or column of a 4x4 grid of tiles and buying one or more of these tiles. The tiles have powerful effects and tailoring your play around the tiles you've bought is important. The market mechanism is interesting, but there is not much tension. When you select your row/column you know which row/columns those ahead of you in turn order selected and you should have a pretty good idea which tiles they are going to buy. I do like the way the tiles inform your strategy, but I wish the market phase had more tension.

The action phase involves placing discs to perform actions, a.k.a. worker placement. There are no shortage of spots for players to take, so in that regard there is not much chance of you completely missing out on the action you want. This has led a lot of people I talked to complain about the lack of tension in the worker placement, and I guess they're right, but we found the action phase to be rife with tension. I think there are two reasons for that: 

1) There is a lot of tension in claiming territory on the board. You have to take an action to claim territory on the map, and later you can build buildings on your claimed territory. Claiming territory to interfere with your opponents is not only smart, it's fun. You can't ruin their day, but you can cause them small set-backs.

2) Each player has a single special worker. The first player to use her special worker at an action spot gets a bonus, each action spot has a different bonus. Getting the bonus you want can make a big difference to how efficient you can be that round. There is not much in the way of blocking someone from an action entirely, but there is a lot of blocking someone from their desired bonus action.

[center][ImageID=2711148 medium][/center]

The game has the stereotypical switch from engine building to VP building in the mid-to-late game. Here ii is quite literal, as you have to take an action to change the production of your buildings. I fear that repeated plays will not be kind to this game. Buildings appear in a deterministic way each game based on the round number, and there is a VP bonus for building them the round they become available. Then during the mid game you need to switch them to produce VPs. It all seems very scripted. There are wrinkles, and the player interaction will force you to make some interesting decisions, but overall it's going to feel very much the same every game. Which at 2 hours of play time is not what I'm looking for.

On the topic of poor iconography the game has two prestige markers which both use the exact same icon. The icon appears many places in the game, on the board, on market tiles, and on buildings. Those icons all look identical, however the ones on buildings are for the marker on your player mat, those on the board are for the marker on the scoring track. If in the top-left corner of a market tile it's for the player mat, but if it's on the central part of the market tile it's for the scoring track! Yowzers!! Complete, inexcusable fail, I have no idea how it came to be. Alas, it is a rather trifling thing, and not too much to endure for an excellent game, however it's only a good game, so it stings just a bit more :P

RATING: 6
Moderately engaging game that falls short in a few areas.

1. Production - the artwork is different enough that I am hesitant to criticize it, but it's just a little too bland, even for me. I don't mind that it looks like pencil sketches, but the coloring is not distinct enough and it hurts the playability of the game. Also, at least in my copy, many of the cardboard chits have had one side of the backing fall off. More of them fell off after having played once. Am I going to have to keep asking for replacements as I play the game?

2. Theme - while I'm definitely against standard euro (and Ameritrash) themes, the theme here is kind of silly. Is this inspired by Laputa? The whole floating city thing makes almost no sense.

3. Game play - it's just not unique enough to stand out in such a crowded space. There are so many strategic 90 - 120 minute games that this just doesn't demand to be played repeatedly.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

I was really enjoying my play until I hit the seventh and final round and realized that it was going to be an almost dead round as I only had 2 cubes left. Without cubes, one cannot reserve ground on which to build nor buildings to construct and own. In the final round as well, one cannot acquire developments without cubes. Felt like the game should have ended after 6 rounds instead of 7. (Later found out that these ownership cubes are not intended to be limited which means that Spielworxx didn't put nearly enough cubes in the game.)

Otherwise, I found it an engaging game in manipulating your income to gain population points/prestige/cubes/money. The development selection mechanism was particularly interesting in how it functioned although it frequently stunk to go last! 

Game also takes up a ton of space...but not as much as I expected.

RATING: 6
An interesting worker placement game where you are trying to build up a city.  You have to claim territory and then build.  There is an element of resource management where you acquire gold, stone and wood to build buildings.  The building is not very tricky.  

In general the game mechanics are good, however, the graphic design is terrible.  The game needs a colorful cheat sheet for tiles so you know what they do. I liked the game, but found the graphic design issues a big impediment to enjoying the game fully.  It needs a new edition.

C'è qualcosa di molto bello in questo gioco, ma c'è anche un po' di roba che non mi convince. Siamo di fronte a un gioco bello quadrato, definito, con diverse vie strategiche e approcci, un gioco interessante e per nulla banale. Nessun punto d'ombra,  tutto chiaro (con il supporto dei fogli aiuto) e ben regolamentato. Un gioco profondo ma senza troppe regole, un gioco solido in sintesi. A convincermi meno, oltre alla grafica non di mio gradimento, è l'ambientazione che non si avverte ma soprattutto che infastidisce più che rilassare, appesantisce più che semplificare rendendo il gioco ancora più nebuloso. Aggiungo che il tentativo di rendere il gioco indipendente dalla lingua ha trasformato il tutto in una serie infinita di simboli e codici a volte microscopici e poco chiari oltre agli agghiacciante confusione che generano i punti prestigio della che non si capisce mai se vanno nella plancia personale o nel segnapunti sul tabellone. Il gioco dura 7 turni che si susseguono in 2 fasi per nulla collegate ma entrambe ben congegnate. La prima di acquisizione delle tessere privilegio e la seconda un tradizionale piazzamento lavoratori con una diverse opportunità e alcune simpatiche trovate (come il lavoratore speciale). Il gioco rimane molto gradevole, sicuramente complesso e da padroneggiare con qualche partita di ambientamento, materiali buoni ma grafica che scoraggia molto.

Box top is slightly concave.  Not really an issue but want to mention it for full disclosure.
Replaced red/pink resource cubes with purple ones (30).
Added 5 cubes for each player color.

心得:
有點乾的遊戲
收入軌設計太爛
那麼多標記要擺在同一格分常麻煩
最高幾格也根本用不太到
其實也沒什麼座標選取
就只能拿資源而已
遊戲主軸還是再利用資源
工人放置來蓋建築物搶收入跟分數
但是資源太緊
覺得變化不算是很多
規則:
*使用對應人數的市場板塊，照背面分類兩推洗勻，白色的抽16張開著放到圖版左上市場區，剩下的蓋著放一旁，建築板塊照背面數字跟字母分類洗勻蓋著，開0/1的
*每個玩家拿取一個顏色的所有配件，有三個工人員片先放中間供應取，一開始不能使用，大的名譽標記跟人口標記放分數軌0位置，小的名譽標記/金錢標記/一個方塊放到個人圖版旁備用，一個小屋放在個人圖版第二格，隨機順位放對應顏色方塊在順位軌，照順位起始拿3元，之後依序多1元
*遊戲進行七輪，每輪有三個階段，每次只要名譽分超過10的倍數時，會得到個人圖版目前小屋所在位置的分數(如果在起始格則只有一分)，用人口標記紀錄之
1.市場階段 每輪開始時先補滿市場板塊，左到右，上到下，白色用完補灰色，之後照順位每人放一個飛船板塊在空的一列或一欄旁邊(也不能再別人對面)，放完後在照順位決定要拿幾個對應列或欄的市場板塊，最近的1元之後依序加1元，可拿任意個，不照順序
*上面有標5元的則價格就固定為5元，如果要買是該列/欄有空位，每個拿1元買完後拿
*遊戲最後一輪移除所有市場板塊使用版圖的來行動，買的上面放方塊標記之
2.行動階段 剩下工人時公開資訊，照順位每個人放一或多個工人在一個行動區的圓格上並執行對應行動，有限制的要照限制放，沒工人的就跳過，有工人一定要放，所有人放完結束，自己行動階段可以任意使用市場板塊
*每個行動第一個使用特殊工人的有獎勵
>順位格 每輪結束時，照放置順位移動方塊，沒放的照原始順位往後移，特殊獎勵為獲得你當下位置的名譽分數
>收入 放幾個工人拿幾元，一格每3個在+1元，特殊獎勵+2元
>資源 放幾個工人拿幾個資源方塊，特殊獎勵多拿一個
>買地 一個地一元，放1/2/3個工人可買1/2/4塊地，形狀有限制，可更多工人任意分配要買多少地，特殊獎勵免費一塊地
*起始買地是要在中央螺旋槳鄰近八格內，之後就相鄰(包括對角)自己地或建築
*起始如果沒辦法合法買到起始八格內，可選擇跟任意玩家建築相鄰
>建設 一個工人可買螺旋槳跟蓋建築，也可二選一，同樣的要執行兩個就要多放工人，特殊獎勵4名譽分，買螺旋槳就付上面金額，放方塊上去，同時獲得對應名譽分，蓋建築則支付對應資源蓋在你的土地上，移除土地上面方塊，放一個方塊到建築板塊上兩格之一，並調整收入，然後每個買到的螺旋槳跟建築板塊都前進個人小屋標記一格(每隔圖板上小屋算小屋軌一格)
*拿新工人的下個回合才能使用
*每次該等同該回合的建築時獲得兩個人口分數
>獲取市場板塊  放一個工人到對應顏色格，花3元(即使標價5元)拿一個市場板塊，有放塊個人顏色的可以之後行動放白色格，特殊獎勵獲得任意資源方塊一個
>買花園 花一元放一個花園板塊到自己地皮上，特殊獎勵兩人口分
>改變建築上方塊位置 放置規則同拿市場板塊，可換最多兩個建築並調整收入軌，特殊獎勵多移動一個
*建築0獲得的工人不會在移走方塊後移除，但是也不會在放回時再多拿
3.收入階段 根據個人圖版收入軌，拿錢，任選資源方塊，名譽分，之後結算順位行動，輪標記前進一格，工人飛船回手，可再使用的市場板塊翻回
*第七輪沒有收入階段，直接到最後分數結算，再拿一次收入，根據手邊市場板塊拿名譽分，每個相鄰公園的建築獲得等同大小的名譽分(對角不算)，根據市場板塊拿人口分，最多人口分數的勝利，平手比名譽分離下次10分近得

The Dilluvia Project is a fairly heavy city-building game that features a very interesting income and point-scoring system. You claim spots on the central board and spend resources to build buildings on them, and those building can give you income in money, resources, and/or "prestige". Prestige isn't points though--each time you get 10 prestige, you score points proportional to the number of buildings you've played. The game operates via a worker placement system in which you can stack multiple workers on the same spot to get more benefits, and you have one super-worker who gets a bonus, provided he is the first super-worker to go to that area. All in all, I found this to be a very enjoyable, if intricate, game where you have to juggle a lot of competing goals.

By far the best game I played at Essen 2015; it's are all known mechanics als gathering resources, reserving building spots and using those to get the buildings were you have to chose between getting money and points. But everything is very well implemented!

RATING: 7.5
Easily the best game I learned all month. There is so much going on in this game and it is SUPER hard to plan and figure out and I just love it. It really is a brain burner for me. So clever, unique design. It has a lot of familiar mechanics so it will be easy to teach but hard to masher. What is so different is that you don't just get points. You have to get points and every 10 points you get you are able to score your population base on your housing track. As the game moves on you get more buildings and thus score more for your population. The highest population at the end wins, not the most VP's. You have to manage all of these income tracks and it is a tough act to balance. Deep thinking and planning and you have to worry about board space on top of it. I can't stop thinking about this game.

This is a very satisfying city builder. Players take turns placing one or more worker disks on the action spots, which collects them resources, claims them building areas, or builds buildings. Each building is marked with a player cube that represents that building's resource production. At the end of the turn, there's an income phase where you get stuff for what your buildings produce. The game has a wonderful ramp-up where new buildings get revealed that have better production but the costs of those buildings go up. The scoring mechanism is a little clunky, where you get X real points where X is = to the number of buildings you have built so far, which scores every time your fake points marker crosses a 10, but it's not bad once you get used to it. 

There are some unclear things about the rulebook, and there are a few questionable changes the publisher made to the game that the designer didn't test. In fact, I still have one or two questions about small things in the game I'm not sure we got right. Additionally, there is very little variation in the game session to session, so the game rewards experience in terms of which buildings to construct when and how, although there are enough opportunities for player choices to throw a monkeywrench in your plans that this is a minor issue.

RATING: 8
There is some confusion between big and small prestige points, especially since the iconography doesn't attempt to differentiate the two at all, but if you keep a player aid handy to help understand the way the game flows and when real points get triggered you'll likely find a very deep and rewarding game. Perhaps it's needlessly complicated in parts amd the components certainly have some issues, but overall this was a great surprise.

Jogo complexo mas fácil de se entrar nele, onde são especialmente importantes o saber manobrar o quadro de compras e o timing de transição para a parte mais pontuável das construções. Voltarei a jogar com gosto.

The first game didn't blow me away but I realized that like almost everyone else that has played this, I got some rules wrong. So I went back for a second game and played it correctly, and it made quite a difference. The worker placement aspect of the game is really good, and I like the tension that it creates by being the first to place your special worker in a section. I love games that require good timing. The market phase is quite puzzly which I like, and just the overall design is really good. There's nothing super duper original, but everything it does, it does well. The board is spectacular, it's big, beautifully illustrated and graphically efficient. I never wondered what anything meant. The production issues with the whole cubes situation is a pain in the ass yes, but thankfully I got purple cubes in my copy. I guess the seller included some himself, kudos. Aside from the cubes thing, I think the production values are high. Plays well with 2 but I feel like it would shine with more. Over and out.

Let'S call it:  "Heavyweight worker placement game"

Kind of basic worker placement mechanic game, with a multiplying scoring mechanism, to determine a winner, that may lead to huge splits in the final score.

Except of the initial starting order, there is almost no luck involved, espacially if you decide to refill the market right after the market phase, so you are able to include the next market phase into your plans. (I recomend doing this, cause the luck of the draw when it comes to certain scoring pieces can be crucial.)

Biggest disadvantage is, that you might have some longer downtimes, cause there is a lot to think through, espacially then you are eager to trigger the maximum amount of prestige scorings and still getting a good resource payout.


Conclusion:

Great game for deep-thinking and planning players, that love to ger to the bottom of a game mechanic.

Interesting game with a LOT going on. It's sort of a complex worker placement game, with a little (but important) market step happening first in each of the 7 rounds. Go to market to buy tiles (for various special powers, resources, cash, etc.). Then take turns allocating your workers. The twists there are:
- you can allocate multiple workers to an action to make it better
- you have one single uber worker; the first person to use their superguy at each action gets a bonus to the action
The actions allow you to claim territory on the board (adjacent to your other claims), build on your territory (better buildings become available each round), acquire resource cubes (used to build buildings), move ahead in turn order, etc. You earn VP, cash, cubes, and/or prestige during your turn (for a variety of things) and at the end (income depending on the buildings you've built). Whenever your prestige reaches a multiple of 10, you score VP based on how many buildings you've built.

Interesting, but it almost seems overly complex. Whereas the score-on-the-10s worked in Sunrise City, here it feels sort of clunky -- maybe just because there's so much else going on? The poor production choices didn't help, either:
- cube color/count issues (though I played with a fixed copy, thankfully!)
- several of the icons are TINY! With the market off in one corner, it's going to be tough for someone sitting opposite from seeing what's going on!
- prestige icons to go up in income look exactly like the ones to get actual prestige!

I think I'd like to try it again, but only if someone else happens to bring it!

tl;dr: very solid

Since a couple of years any title put out by Spielworxx automatically ends up on my 'want to play' list, even though some of their games have been... less than stellar. But this game was right up my alley again. A good hefty euro with not too much luck and interesting decisions. OK, it's worker placement yet again, but you won't hear me complaining about that. It's also a building game with resources yet again. In fact, this game brings very little new elements to the table. And unlike [thing=146886][/thing], which brought together very recognizable mechanisms in an interesting way, this game feels much more generic. Go to some place and get some resources or tiles or money, and use those to build and score points. But again this game proves you don't need to do anything new as long as you do it well.

Initial rating: 7.5/10
BGG scale: 7/10

Some nice things going on here, but ultimately, it is an engine builder where the rich get richer.  You can tell 50-60% of the way in who is going to win, and there is very little anyone can do to change that.

Intriguing sci-fi worker placement to build a propelled sky city and attract ground dwellers to live amidst the clouds. Fly steampunk Zeppelin markers over to the bonus tile market square is a big part of setting up your engine. Several worker placement action choices to leverage bonus tiles, get resources, manage tight money, get sky city plots and build on them with activated buildings. Some unique systems introduce interesting strategy decisions; placing workers in stacks to get increased amounts, timing when and where to gain extra action bonus with the special worker, scoring occurs along trigger points on the prestige track. I had trouble following the rules on how these variations of worker placement work. There is quite a bit of iconology. Game progression is very good. Start with simple bonus tiles and simple buildings that evolves into working big combos, coordinating big groups of workers for big building placements. Pretty cool to see what the sky city looks like at the end.  A satisfying challenge.

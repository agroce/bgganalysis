It has been a while since I played this game. I vaguely recall that it was a rather brutal area control card drafter that set up like a square frame of cards. The art was appealing and the play did not leave a bad impression. I suppose I should try to get this to the table again soon so I can put together a better comment for it.

Beautiful components and mind boggling game play makes a fantastic small and simple game worth every dime. 

Artwork is great. Game play is simple but options every turn may need some plan. Random placement of tokens brings about replay value. Draft carefully, not every high card is good for you. 

Play with a few devious friends and the game really shines. 

Not a filler game. It's light medium to me with the right crowd.

Masques is a fairly clever and quick card drafting game. It is an extremely vindictive little thing, too. The game is basically a fight over stopping the other players from scoring points. It can honestly get a little annoying / drawn out that way. But basic gameplay is pretty unique and interesting anyway. I think it's cool.

For Backstabing fun, original concept and complex game.

As so often with Euro games, the object of Intrigo is to gain influence with powerful families. A tableau of buildings is set out, placed on each one is either a random family seal or a coin. Cards are played between two buildings; the highest value card played next to a building wins what's on it. So far, so ho-hum.

Two things add interest. Players get their hand of cards through drafting. You may concentrate on the cards of your faction, but just as likely you will pick up some of your opponents' powerful cards. How to play those to the minimum effect? The second thing is money. It's sole use is to purchase various character cards that do things like switch crests, negate a played card or require a certain card to be played. The net result is a devious and nasty little game of the kind that I quite enjoy.

The masquerade-themed artwork is nicely done, though the quality of the cards and of the itsy money chits isn't great.  Plus points to Hazgaard for including a draw bag in the box when they didn't have to.

Nice little area influence filler game. A lot of back-stabbing and chaos. Players try to collect influence and also money so they can hire various shady characters like guards, thieves, assassins, etc who can really mess the game up. The artwork is nice but the player cards look pretty much the same. Its a bit confusing.

While I can appreciate the design, this game is a total nightmare for me. Despite appearing as a "game" where you have control over, you actually don't. There are to many permutations and character cards to work out and anyone else can kingmake or stop you easily by simply buying a character or playing one of their higher cards. The game is also an APer's paradise - it was excrutiating to wait a few minutes for every card to be played. There is virtually no planning despite what it appears due to people being able to stop you at their leisure. In addition, the game is an eyesore, cramped and headache inducing with the 4 x4 playing area like staring and working on a slow moving excel spreadsheet - something I do at work and do not have the slightest inclination to want to do in a game. I fail to see any game here, it feels like a frustrating puzzle where you wait for your fate. Quite possibly one of the worst games I have ever played.

RATING: 5
Mar 2011:  The problem with this game is that anything that can be brilliantly planned can often be undone by players after you if they have enough money.    There is little to no incentive to play well and take an early lead, as 3 players can just squash you round after round if they want.   

Games like this bother me, which is a reason that my interest in games like Intruige have been dropping over time.   Games where you are encouraged to lose for 50%+ of the game are, IMO, spiritually broken.  

The card actions are also very confusing and poorly illustrated.  Even now after playing the game for a couple of hours I have no idea what half the cards do or where they can legally be moved or executed from.

The final issue is that the game is simply too long.   It suffers from the Dragon's Gold issue of players just lengthening out the game undoing each other until all currency is exhausted.  There is also a huge king making issue in this game -- if you're not careful you can hand another player critical points quickly.

Initial rating is a 5, with no desire to play again, although I'd play if someone brought it to the table.

The tension in this game is that early plays have the greatest choice in terms of where you have an impact (because all the spots are available), but have the greatest potential for being undone (because everyone has all their turns left to use cards against you), while later plays have few choices (or none on the last play of the round) as to where you can have an impact, but are more difficult to undo.

It certainly has some neat ideas but, the problem is that, for me, the game is very abstract (I am not attached to my clan and I might never even play one of my own clan cards throughout the entire game), short, and there's so many possibilities for undoing each other's work, that I don't get really invested while playing it.

[u]August 2010:[/u] Just bought, mostly on a whim

[u]October 2010:[/u] Yes, very good game, both with 3 and with 4 players. Can be very hard to know what a good play is, specially since most of the time, it would seem like you only have pretty bad options.
I suspect a right-player-newbie effect as it is always the player on your right that will have to prevent your opportunities and not give you good spots. I don't really care as long as everybody knows that "your job is to block the player on the left"...

Anyway, I really like this game as of now, I don't know yet how deep it really is (perhaps our decisions don't really have that big an impact but it doesn't feel this way right now).

Anyway, a nice filler, in the same vein as Meuterer I would say in terms of complexity, rules, depth and luck factor. Perhaps more heavy in gameplay and less luck dependent...

Made my own Star Wars version, since I just didn`t like
the graphic feel of the original game. Players are dealt
Luke Skywalker cards with the same numerical values and try collecting force crystals which can be used to play the dark side cards for varying effects. Instead of rooms
in the palace players play their cards on planets from the Star Wars universe. Luke must try to gain profeciency in several traits and abilities like X-Wing flying / Laser sword fighting / Shooting skills etc..
 OK the game is really simple and a filler at
best. But hey! Who doesn`t want to be crowned the ultimate "Jedi knight".

Visually it is very messy to look at and can be hard to see what is going on at a glance. Fundamentally there is nothing wrong with this game, but more often then not I felt myself thinking, "I dunno, I guess I'll do this or put a card here without too much thought to the end effect." In the end I kinda drifted off.

Got this out on the table with my friend Dogzard. We played through the first game to learn it...and...with mistakes and all...loved it! The art is gorgeous, the rule book is clear, the take on backstabbing is sweet, the play is engaging, and the game is efficient. You are either making things happen, or rethinking your strategy and card play when "Those things happen to you". We look forward to playing this with more than two! This is a lot of game in a little box.

Sadly this game suffered from shelf-itis. I got it when I first got into games about a year ago but lots of bigger, shinier boxes grabbed us more. Then I got into print and play and started making tons of games. When this one finally ended up getting played, I find that we have a couple of print and play games that already do the job and scratch the itch of this one. Also, some cards are left out of the 2 player game. This might mean it is more interesting/devious with more players. This game is not as simple as it first seems. There is some deep gameplay to be had. If only I'd played it sooner...

This game gives you the illusion of control however there are far to many cards that stop you rather than enabling you.
This generally means that the rewards for the placements (coins and or favour) are usually left sitting on the cards as time and time again the placed cards tie for control therefore nobody gets anything and the game is prolonged for yet another round.

RATING: 5
A card game totally of backstabbing and interaction, which I usually enjoy.  However building a strategy was impossible and there was so very little control that nothing much happened and it turned into one long grind from one round to the next.  

Confusion:  
     The cards are so similar and the illustrations in the rules so uninformative, that it took forever to figure out which cards were what.  
     I played for hours yet I was still unclear which cards did what because the icons are not intuitive.  

I bought it because it is on Bruno Faidutti's Ideal game list, and the illustrations are beautiful.

I need to play some more before I decide to sell it, but if my opinion doesn't improve, will move it off my shelves.

A szabályok aránylag egyszerűek, ám dobozból tanulni elég nehéz, mert a kártyák elsőre szinte megkülönböztethetetlenek. Azért csak sikerült megtanulni, elsőre úgy gondoltam, hogy egy totál káosz játék lesz, de némileg tévedtem. Tényleg van benne keveredés, de igen komoly döntések vannak, és nagyon sok mindenre kell figyelni. Mi kell nekem, mi kell a többieknek, milyen kártyák vannak még kézben, kinek mennyi pénze van, a sépci karaktereket mire tudnám használni. És ezt tényleg minden lépésnél számba lehet venni. A doboz láttán ne hagyjátok magatokat megtéveszteni, mert egyrészt ez egy nagyon jó kis játék, másrészt annyira nem is kicsi, mert marha sok hely kell hozzá az asztalon. :)

A lot of adjusting and card-counting for not TOO much game. 

It's an interesting combination of mechanics, but I wasn't inspired, and the likelihood of politics-- when one player is close to winning, *somebody* has to stop them but everybody would rather not be the one to do it-- means it wouldn't be for me even if it was inspiring.

This game's mechanics feel quite clever to me. We've played it far more times than my play counts show, and I'm liking it more and more. Still, it feels that the game is usually over too quickly. The first couple of rounds just find the players getting whatever they can with little-to-no need for any strategy. It's only in the last round or two that people start trying to screw each other and before you can really get into it, someone manages to win. You really have to keep track of everyone's Favor counts.

Nice fast playing and very rules light filler type game, that might run just a touch long for what it is, depending on how much 'group think' takes place (stop the leader due to open info). Theme is pasted. Its set collection with a little take that thrown in. Its light but there is enough there to hold to your interest while playing, I just don't see it having much legs, good for occasional filler. 

Its done well overall, I like that there is 2 ways to win, and play is simple; play a card or buy a card. Also playing other people's cards is a good aspect here, you get torn on keeping your own in the initial draft to make your hand OR trying to stop others from doing well by keeping their good cards, and then later deciding where to play them (or not at all).

One 4p play only

Super-fast game - only went to three rounds, although with a little more experience I suspect it will go longer.

Cunning game of managing and manipulating influence points, in which the players have to spend as much effort policing each other to avoid someone else winning as they do advancing their own cause. 

Not every card gets played each round so it can be worth sitting on your opponents' high value cards, or using their low value ones to deny them opportunities, but you still need to get your own cards into favourable positions too - all in only four plays each round!

RATING: 5
I'd like to be proven wrong, but Intrigo was not very inspiring on first play.  I'm all for backstabbing and interaction in games, though here it feels like simple "take that" actions that get discussed all throughout the game.  "You should kill his guy, he's in the lead".  I actually don't have that big of a problem with it, but it gets frustrating in that you can't get very much done and the game grinds to a standstill until one person manages to push themselves over the line.  Fist of Dragonstones feels similar in that you try and hold the leader back until everyone is a leader.  But at least in Fist of Dragonstones the blind bidding removes the negotiation element.  I like negotiation, but here it's more like Settlers-style whining.  "Why me?"

Probably the main problem with the game lies in the intrigue cards, which are the heart of the game.  They accomplish very similar things, yet the icons on it are not clear enough for players to understand what they do.  I supposed after playing a couple times you get it down, but you know there's a problem when even at the end of the first game people are asking what a particular card does or getting them confused.

Still, I'd like to try this again - if the play time came down (it feels a tad long), I'm willing to rerate.

Good looking game, but that's the only good thing here. I've seen this kind of games too many and the lenght is a bit too long compared to competitors. Gameplay needs more surprise elements (unfortunately every card is played every round) and more action going on - now there are only two cards fighting for the glory. And when the end is near, my opinion is, that it's more like random who will win, no skill... Sorry, Intrigo is no my cup of tea.

Muy divertido y no exento de estrategia. Puteo continuo y puede dar lugar a algo de kingmaking, aunque muchas veces de forma involuntaria. Juego muy recomendable para 3 o 4 jugadores, seguro que cuando lo saques juegas más de una partida.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

At first I thought it rather charming and intriguing. By the end, I found it AP prone and annoying with a fair potential of king making. I did think that the draft was clever in that you could draft other people's high cards and keep them from being played or place them in such a way that their high value is neutered...assuming said person doesn't have money to purchase special cards to move their high card to a better location, etc. I don't have any desire to play this again.

Lukewarm reviews with a little love. One amazon reviewer wrote (unfavorably): "This card game, is just so tedious to set up and read the rules. The gameplay, is well its boring. Honestly your better off with Citadels, or Dominion, or even Betrayal at the House On the Hill. They are much more fast paced games, have more interesting mechanics and are amazingly simply once you play them once."

RATING: 8
Area control game with cool art where players play cards to try to gain influence (seals) and money (to purchase special powers).  Each round starts with a draft (cards are all dealt out, each player takes one card and then passes the remaining cards to the next player, repeat until everybody has the required number of cards... we see this in 7 Wonders too).  

The rules are simple but the game play is deceptively difficult.  Cards are all placed on each side of the  awards: seals & money available to win.  The "board" is a 5X5 square (not filled in).  The two cards on each side of the awards determine who will win the award -- strongest strength wins, nobody wins on ties.  Of course cards can be switched around or killed off, etc. by purchasing the special powers.  The limited special power cards start off cheap but then get more expensive as they're bought. 

What makes it interesting is your hand of drafted cards will consist of your opponent's influence cards too.  Your opponents may have drafted your strongest cards.  So the trick is how do you play your opponent's cards in a way to benefit yourself? 

You win by being the 1st to collect 4 seals of one faction or one seal from each of the 5 factions.  Easier said than done -- it's tough to be the leader in this game.

I would like to play it with more players since I definitely think this game is designed for more players. I have heard mixed reviews for it being too slow with more, but I don't know. I think the artwork is the bomb and for this small boxed game think there is a lot of potential. Should have been Game of Thrones theme- it would be more popular.

RATING: 5
This is a light game where you brick out these cards into a square. They are placed in alternating coin or faction spots, leaving room for cards between. Players draft character cards representing themselves, all other player's guys and the guys of one unaligned color. Then players play whatever cards they managed to draft into the spots on the wall. At the end of a round, whichever color has the most strength adjacent to a coin or faction spot, gets the reward for that spot. To add interest, there are unaligned guys with special abilities you can buy and place instead of being forced to use that high strength opponent's guy you drafted. It's cute and there are a lot of moving pieces to think about. I feel ambivalent about this game as I never really felt I had a good grasp of what the strategy is and what to be careful about. Our game ended where I wound up handing the victory to someone else out of not seeing the only move that would have stopped him, because I was too focused on setting myself up for a victory on the following turn.

This is a clever card game marred by the fact that it is a card game. If the cards were changed into tiles and palace cards changed into a single board,and perhaps the score cards integrated into the board, the game would be a joy to play.

Looks like another run-of-the-mill card-drafting game on the surface, but it has surprising depth and nastiness. 

Card drafting is either used as a tack-on variant to more complicated games (Race for the Galaxy, Agricola), or as a lazy mechanism to play colorful cards that combine with each other on the table (Fairy Tale, Midgard, 7 Wonders to a large extent). I thought card drafting the same easy-to-remember 16-card deck each time was integrated very naturally here, with you knowing the location of 5 cards for sure, and having an idea of 5 others, and allowing you to try a different strategic approach each round.

2 divergent victory conditions (1 each of 5 colors, or 4 of one color), help-you-help-me, one-time-use abilities, and complete change in board position with each player turn. Lots of things going on, and lots of delicious ideas to force others to do your bidding (i.e. whack the leader), or to pull off an unstoppable scoring gambit. Ducat vs. faction tokens is a hard trade-off.

Play cards to add to the board. Special abilities allow you to manipulate the board, and also put off playing a bad card at the cost of Ducats, but you'll rarely be able to afford more than 2 a game, so you need to time them well, since they get more expensive as more players use them.

The nasty plays in here actually convey the political maneuvering and alliances in the theme.

1 play, 4er

Kinda cool card game. We learned this one from the rulebook, too; it took a while, but it's not so difficult: a trick-taking game where you draft your hand each time. The cards, ranked 1-4, are from different families, which each of the players represent. There are also neutral character cards. A board is created: cards, each showing a type of seal (5 in game) or coin, are placed in a ring with spaces between them. There are also several cards in the center, which may be purchased with coins and played. Players play their cards in spaces on the board; some will manipulate cards or tokens while others just stay in place. After all the cards have been played, each seal and coin is awarded to the family with a higher card on either side of it. A player wins when they collect 4 of 1 type of seal, or 1 of each.

Fun game!

About [thing=65673][/thing]:

[b]1) What is it?[/b]
[thing=65673][/thing] is a hand management card game mixed with area influence and card drafting. But mostly it is a mean game.

In [thing=65673][/thing] players are vying to get the most influence with the guilds - either 1 influence with each of the 5 guilds, or 4 of influence with one of them.

[thing=65673][/thing] offers a good amount of decisions, in both phases (drafting and placing cards), while also being easy to teach and to play (to a point - it can be hard to decide what to play where).

It is very portable, being just a small set of cards and some tokens - but, the set up requires a good amount of room, because of the way the cards are placed. The production value, of the FF edition, is merely OK: there is nothing to be excited about in the art, quality or graphic design, and nothing is objectively bad also.

[b]2) How do you play?[/b]
Once the set up is done (rooms are placed such as money and guilds are intercalated; with a hallway space - for the family and Guest cards - between each of them), the round starts with a draft of cards. All the family cards are put together, alongside the neutral family cards. The draft is a usual one: pick one card, pass the others, until everyone is back to the same amount of cards they start with. Family cards have values ranging from 2 to 4.

Then comes the placing cards phase. Cards are placed in the vacant places of the "ball room" and influence both rooms it touches (usually a card with a guild token and other with money - a ducat). Instead of playing a card from hand, the player can pay to use a Guest instead - the Guest also goes into a vacant corridor, and then its ability triggers. Guest can do several things: move family cards, change tokens, turn down family cards, call for specific cards, and so on. They have costs, which are paid in ducats - and the sooner they are used, cheaper it is to use.

Once all the hallways are occupied, comes the resolution: tokens (either guild influence or ducats) are given to the family (player) that has the higher number around that token, starting with the room (card) that has the door symbol and going clockwise. Ducats are used, in later rounds, to pay to use Guests. Guild influence is what wins the game: either by having 1 in each guild, or by having 4 in a single guild - the player that first do this, wins the game! If none do, a new round begins.

[b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b]
On the draft: which card to keep;
On the placement: which card to put and in which place. This is the key decision, both in trying to get influence or money, and also to block others from getting what they want. This decision also connects with paying or not to use a Guest. There is a lot of back and forth going on around here - and is important, while deciding, the moment of using certain cards: be to wait and see what the others will try, be to snag a hallway before someone else.

Overall, the decisions, as seen, aren't complex on themselves. However, what make them hard to be made, sometimes, is all the connections: timming, board state (what is where and who is where), the needs of everyone (including yourself), the cards you are holding, what Guests the others and you can hire. This makes the possibilities around a decision plentiful, and the best choice difficult to see.

[b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b]
- Small box, being highly portable;
- Language independent;
- Easy to teach;
- Has a fine quantity of decision points;
- High level of interaction between players, even with some very light cooperation.

[b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b]
- Takes a fine chunk of table space (it is small to carry around, but it will be hard to be played in small tables);
- Has bash the leader and take that (with the Guest cards);
- Takes more time to finish than it should;
- Random elements (in the distribution of cards and preparation of the rooms) can make luck an important factor in deciding the outcome.

[b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b]
[thing=65673][/thing] is a complicated game to know what I should feel about it, both when playing and afterwards. In one hand is has good mechanics: the draft is a good idea, the positioning of cards is clever and gives many relevant decisions and some tension, the Guest cards allow for many possibilities and, when properly used, can cause big twists, and the two ways for the game to end (having 1 of each influnce or 4 in one) makes basically all influence gained be of use, be for now or by the accumulation. Great.

On the other hand, though, it has plenty of scuffle. Is a constant bickering of fingers on the eyes of others, taking the candy of the child, kicking the blind man on the ground. This turns the game, besides a strife match, into a drag, going on for more than it should: this level of cretinism can work and be supported by around 30, maybe 45 minutes - but not 60 to 90. This end up being the death of [thing=65673][/thing]: few have the interest in returning to it, knowing what will come and for how long. Sure, it is the nature of the beast: the designers had a big success into making the game into a huge back and forth, a battle in a ball; but failed in make it end quickly enough.

Очаровательная игра. Лично мне приглянулясь больше, чем многие другие ингтрижные игры (Citadels, напр.). Немного фиддлёвая, правда.

Но эта ситуация бывает не обязательно должна складываться каждый раз.
Надо поиграть еще. Предварительно 8/10.

Сыграв еще 3 партии вчетвером обнаружил, что геймплей отличается по сравнению с 3-мя игроками. В последних раундах паралич анализа может не раз возникнуть, а в самом последнем раунде случилась ситуация, что последним своим ходом игрок, не побеждающий никак, может решить, кто из других выиграет.
Поэтому возникшее было желание поднять оценку пока исчезло. Но игра очень завлекает!

LOADS of depth in this small game!

A not-bad drafting and influence placing game. It is set a bit apart from similar games thanks to the drafting phase (you get to choose between cards from all factions together) and the addition of special power cards which (quite remarkably) grow in cost as they are bought the first times and the game progresses.
The rulebook is horrible; this is at its heart a very simple game but the rules are quite difficult to grasp at first.

The second game by Catherine Dumas, Charles Chevallier and Pascal Pelemans in my collection (their first), who seem to be attempting to create rich and interactive experiences in under an hour. It's interesting that there's potentially that much game in such a tiny box! That's possibly some straight up great design already.

Love the artwork. Love the size of the box. Don't be fooled by the small box - there is a lot of game inside. Bluff, push your luck, strategy and take that. A very solid 8, possibly even a 9 if it works well with 4.  I am quite impressed by it.

No theme actually, but great artwork & components and a good game also. Surely a better one than someone would expect from such a little box.

5 after 1 play.

This games utilises sabotaging as part of the main game mechanic. It is something I really dislike, because a player is pulling another player down and the other player(s) are gaining off my action. The artwork on the guests are also a little difficult to tell apart.

Quite a bit better than I was expecting.  Choosing where to play your cards takes some thinking since you only indirectly control your family cards.

RATING: 8.2
Incredibly underrated game.
This is a highly confrontational, tense, and cut-throat card-drafting game. Never played something like this. People may dislike it because being devious as it is requires players of equal skills to be enjoyed.

Those who don't like games that enable "bash-the-leader" situations should also avoid it.

Great thing FFG is picking this one up.

Игра перебалансирована. При должной внимательности побеждает либо тот, кто может просчитать на 5-6 ходов са-амое последнее действие, исходя из выгоды игроков. Ну или тот, кому повезло в глупом сопернике. 

Игра не плоха, она не длинная, она умная. Но принимаемые в ней решения меня после 3-й партии перестали интересовать.

Minimalist in the components, cheap in the price, simple in the rules but very deep in the possible strategies! A real surprise, absolutely suggested! Moreover, it is completely language-independent!

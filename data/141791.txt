8+ plays, 2 players.

LIKE: A two player, couples game. Quick, light, but with some minimal strategy and push your luck.

DISLIKE: I like the tangible components, but it can be hard to see the red and pink differences in candies. The end game can run long if some of the medals has been won rendering some colors useless.

OVERALL: Enjoyable.

So far I absolutely love the theme, the colorful cards and the excellent bits. 

The gameplay is good. One big change I'm trying to get used to is that the card distribution is uneven. There are more low numbers than high, and some colors go higher than others. There is no 3 cube conversion rule either. This makes the game feel quite a bit different. 

I'm not sure yet if the changes make the game better, worse, or just different. More plays will tell, but it seems a bit less strategic and more chaotic. Overall, fun though and I'm happy I have it.

It has the designer's preferred rules, which is good, and the wild cards which I'm unconvinced about. They do at least prevent lock-ups.

A fun little 2-player game where you collect candy. I like how it varied whether you needed higher or lower cards to win the candy. We played where we rotated high and low initially and then changed them as the candy was collected.

What starts out as a seemingly easy going card game can turn into an abstract strategy game rather quickly. What numbers can you play where? When is it better to help yourself, versus hinder your opponent? What candies are you focusing on collecting? Thinkier than it seems from the artwork, but no overly so. A fun challenge.

Two major improvements make this far superior to its predecessor, Balloon Cup.

1) You can't play to your opponent's side of a battle until you've finished your own side. I had played Balloon Cup this way for years, as it's obviously a better rule. Otherwise, extreme high or low cards are always good, and there's no angst in having them in your hand.

2) The card values were changed to where you can easily remember the distribution of the available numbers in each color.

So, if you liked Balloon Cup, this is great. If you didn't like Balloon Cup, this makes it decent. If you have no idea what Balloon Cup is, this is a nice little filler card game for two people with some good tension, and mildly interesting decisions.

I really enjoy Pinata but my husband is not a fan. There is quite a lot of strategy in choosing which cards to play. It is strictly a game for two players and that always is a plus in my book. In ways I feel it has some similarities in play to Battle Line, but of course the theme could not be more different!

In Piñata, the players compete to collect the colored candy inside the piñatas. Playing pieces that might otherwise be "cubes" are instead wooden markers with a bow-tie shape that mimics the shape of wrapped candies, coming in five different colors. When a player has collected enough candy of a given color, he earns the medal card for that color, and the first player to earn three medal cards wins!
Compare with BALLOON CUP

RATING: 7
I bought this game because it looked like a quick and simple game for 2 players. After my first few plays against my wife, I am blown away by how well designed it is. The fact that each card and candy colors have their own set of probabilities turns what might be an average game into what I consider an excellent game. There is definately more depth (i.e. replay ability) here than what I was expecting. 

After about 10 plays, I am getting my butt kicked by my wife, but each game has been enjoyable. There have been several games where I was certain I was going to win only to have victory snatched away on the last card. I have not seen any issues with balance in this game. Every game has always come down to the last medal. On the contrary, I have wondered if the game was too forgiving of player mistakes (but that might be my loser bias talking). 

My wife and I generally take longer than the advertised time for most games, but we fly through this one easily in 30 min.

The colors/art is very nice, but I do agree with others that the tiles are too big, which keeps it from being a easily portable game.

A great two player card game. The early game is rather boring, but once players have grabbed some candies, strategic opportunities begin to emerge. Games are generally pretty close, with players battling over the last victory medal. The tiles are spectacular, the candies are cute, but the card art itself is mediocre. It plays a bit long for what it is, but it fits a good niche in my collection. [Pro Tip: Give both players 5 candies at setup for an enhanced yet abridged game]

Nice 2-player game with simple rules and clever interaction. Maybe a bit lucky, but some interesting choices here, in the vein of Balloon Cup and Voltage. 

A niggle about the presentation... the art sets an odd tone. Every card features the same kid, hitting a pinata all by himself. Pinatas are meant for parties! There should be lots of different kids!

My wife - the only person I've played this game with and for whom I got this game - absolutely dominates at this game. I am not sure how she does it but she seems to immediately see which card will do the most damage to my plans and *poof* the card seems to magically appear in her hand just as she's about to play one. 

I've been looking to see if there is any tell-tale nose twitching when it's her turn, but so far I have not caught her using magic to turn her hand of cards into the [b][i]+5 Devastating Flail of Trouncing[/i][/b] that smacks me in the face before I even have a chance to recover from the previous smack.

I like this version, but I do miss some of the elements of Balloon Cup (e.g., 3 for 1 exchange, the high number cards).

The wild cards really have an effect on competing for the "rarer" colors . . . which is both good . . . and not always perfectly good.  [I can only play a "3" yellow card, but I can play a "5" wild in its stead.]

The Pinata guy is cute.  The colors, although thematic, are a bit loud.

Probably going to go up, but this is much more luck based than Morels or Jaipur. That doesn't detract from its fun, or the game's accessibility, but it does drop this one down a bit from the other games I compare it to!

Initial Rating: 5.0 (December 2013)

Very disappointed. As Balloon Cup was one of the first games I ever played, I thought it was going to be at least the same game, or perhaps an improved one. For me, the additions of wild cards and reducing the number of the cards, makes for a worst experience with increased luck. Now, if you played a 1, you are no longer sure the opponent doesn’t have another 1 making this a lot less strategic and interesting. 

The theme is also forgettable (although it makes more sense than in Balloon Cup´s). The graphic design and colors are awful. I would have been much more happier if they just reprinte the original game.

In conclusion, an inferior game than the original in every respect, except the components which are great in Piñata.

Playing pieces that might otherwise be "cubes" are instead wooden markers with a bow-tie shape that mimics the shape of wrapped candies, coming in five different colors. When a player has collected enough candy of a given color, he earns the medal card for that color, and the first player to earn three medal cards wins!

Piñata reimplements Balloon Cup – while adopting the designer's initial theme for the game – with the most significant rule changes being the addition of wild cards, the removal of a three-for-one token exchange, and a revision of the card values (but not the card count within each color).

I really hate to, but I have to lower my rating on Piñata. Don't get me wrong, this is a great game! I love so many things about it: the components, the production value, its art, how it can be played in a half hour, its small footprint, and perhaps most of all, the fact that it's a lot of fun. BUT, it has one rather large flaw. It is way unbalanced. In any game, if players are of equal skill, the game should be decided by only a few cards/turns. However, in Piñata, every other game is often a slaughter-fest. It's just too swingy. It kills me to lower the rating on a game that I love to play with my wife, but I just don't see a way to fix this balance issue.

1st play with the official rules. A surprisingly tense game! It played a lot slower than a game of this depth should have (granted it was a 1st play). But, it does present some difficult decisions and I spent most of the game fretting about what my honey had and screaming in my head, "WHY DO I NOT HAVE ANY CARDS HIGHER THAN A 3!?!?!?!?" It seems very tightly constructed and balanced (even with the wild cards). Not sure if I am in love with it yet or not... I do like that there are variants to try out that will change the feel of the game. Why did this game have to go all "Breaking Color"? I can see colors very well and I absolutely could not decipher the pink from the red candies. You lose the candies on the board completely; it's like  psychedelic rainbows assaulting your eyes while hurling tiny candies at your head at warp speed!

Pinata is a thematic redesign of Balloon Cup and perhaps slightly more family friendly due to the theme.

Essentially the players are trying to play cards to 1 of 4 large tiles in the centre of the table. Each is numbered from 1-4 which denotes how many cards can be played to each side (ala Lost Cities) but the candies placed on each tile determine what colour of card can be placed at each location. 

Each tile also features an up or down arrow to denote the winning condition for that tile (highest or lowest total value). 

Each turn the players take turns in adding one card to one of the tile (Pinata) locations, before drawing a card to end their turn. If by playing a card a tile has the maximum number of cards on each side (again 1-4) then the tile is scored. The player having the highest or lowest total wins the candies at that tile and adds them to their supply. The tile is then flipped to reverse the objective and new candies are drawn to fill the tile. 

But all of this is a means to an end as the players are actually trying to win medals (the first to win 3 of the 5 wins the game). Each medal is coloured to match the candies and each medal requires a certain number to be won. In this way the players may find some Pinata locations to be more desirable to win than others as they try to acquire the right number to win those medals. 

Balloon Cup and Pinata are very good games. Gamers are likely to favour the original theme but Pinata has a better thematic integration and the candy pieces are nicer than the generic cubes of the original design.

Surprisingly the wife did not like this, she enjoyed Lost Cities, Jaipur, and Morels.  She said she would give it another shot.  I found it had some interesting choices to be made, even if like many card games luck of the draw factored heavily.  Our game came down to one final tile and I think this distribution of candy in the bag will keep most endings fairly tight.

Fun but nasty 2 player game that is a bit of a twist on Battle Line. There is perhaps a little more room for meanness in Pinata.  Games can sometimes push the limit on what is a reasonable amount of time, but turns are always quick.  I have seen several games where players are on their third trip through the draw deck before the game ends.  This usually depends on how the candies come out of the bag.  The colors are quite festive, but the drawings do seem like "clip art".  I wish the number boards were a bit smaller with more subdued art so that the candy tokens were more prominent.  The tokens seem to get lost in all the busy graphics.  Regardless, the game is quite fun to play.

A remake of Balloon Cup, or so they say. I haven't actually played that one but this is a tug of war game. 2p with bright colors. Enjoyable theme, but I can't say I enjoy the tug of war thing. You either have the cards or you don't. Not really for me. I hated it in the first couple rounds but by the end found it Okay. I think it is a 1 and done case.

Fun, light, and overall well designed two player classic, which generally has some interesting tactical decisions to be made. However, akin to Lost Cities, the card draws can be crippling and take you out of the game whatever your opponent is doing.

Pros:
* Cute
* A few variants (official and conversions from Balloon Cup) can change the game up quite a bit.
* Sleeved cards easily fit back in the box.

Cons:
* The mats seem unnecessarily large. I think I would have preferred double-sided cards. The game take up quite a bit of room as it is.
* A bit fiddly after someone wins a location: take candies, count candies, possibly take medal cards, (if playing with 3:1 variant, opponent may also be able to take a medal which may again cascade), flip board over, draw new candies, remember whose turn it is now (it's the player who lost the location). It doesn't seem like much, but it's bookkeeping that distracts from the otherwise light play and banter.
* Have to reshuffle two or three times in a game.
* Felt a bit too luck driven.
* Rules are a tiny bit vague.

2 plays so far, both with my wife.

I've seen this billed as an easier Battleline, but then Battleline could be billed as a streamlined, more simple (rules), and better Balloon Cup/Pinata.

We've played a lot of card games, and on occasion we'll forget to draw a card and have to draw an extra on the next turn, but for some reason we were constantly forgetting to draw cards in this game. Once or twice I got down to five cards (supposed to have eight). Maybe that's a sign the game doesn't "flow" well. Maybe I'm just sloppy.

We're not sure if we're playing the rule that allows you to play on the opponent's side correctly. I originally read it to mean you could only play on the other side if there was no other move you could make, but after reading the rules again, it looks like you can play on the other side of any mat in which you've filled your side (and the variant allows you to play on the other side any time). We'll have to see how this changes the game. In today's game, my wife held off putting the last card in the 4-candy mat until the draw pile was reshuffled and the green 6 came back around again. If I had known I could play on her side, I could won that pile.

Starting at a 6. If the correct rules fix things, it could go up. If not, this might go on the trade pile. I guess I'm glad I didn't shell out for a copy of Balloon Cup.

= 2013-04-30 - R:5.5 (correct rules)

Played again with the correct rules. It's even worse this way. Now you're racing to finish your side so you can dump crap cards on your opponent's side. I think I greatly dislike all of the changes between Balloon Cup and Pi�ata. The wilds and duplicate numbers remove all of the deduction fun and the wilds also make the pink and yellow cards worth less. They should have stuck to the 1-13 range for all colors. I also dislike that you can't play a card if it causes a tie. I also think the 3:1 trade rule from Balloon Cup adds a much needed catch-up mechanism that also adds some much needed meaningful decisions.

We haven't yet tried it with the "play on either side at any time" variant and if we do play it again, it will be probably be with most of the original Balloon Cup rules.

I suspect this is another of those games that only got a high rating because its fans drove it up while it was out of print. Trading this away and being more careful about what OOP games I try to track down in the future.

I like the idea of this game. I like the fact you can play cards on your opponent's side, and I like how the goals change. It's not a bad little game. I think some of the mechanics feel a little cumbersome. I'd certainly play this if you asked, but I would almost always prefer Jaipur or Pagoda over this one.

Tried to wait for Balloon Cup, until I found out Pinata was essentially the same game. I wasn't disappointed. Played with my wife, and we both loved it! Will be great for the kids as well. Not as cut-throat as Balloon Cup, which is a good thing when playing against your better half.

Bought new from Madison warehouse sale. Fun two player game that has some basic similarities to Lost Cites or Battle Lines with playing cards on either side of the game boards to gain reward. Not nearly as good as those two games, but works well with basic level strategies. Visually attractive and worth playing every now and then.

An enjoyable game that drags out for too long. I enjoy the tug-of-war nature of the card play, but it got pretty tedious after a couple of plays. The art direction doesn't seem to fit either. The orange color board means low cards and the dark color means high? It was extremely confusing and we played it backwards the first time. Just not enough there to keep us interested.

A fun 2 player strategy game that bears much in common with Battle Line but with a much lighter theme. The game can occasionally devolve into a runaway leader issue though, as a player who gets far ahead basically forces his opponent to play defense the rest of the game instead of building toward winning.

It seems like bad card draws can really have an effect on the game. To help negate this, it seems like you have to play with the rule that you can play cards on either side (the rulebook has a variant to play cards only on your own side). Also, the value of each color card is different because the numbers are distributed differently, so it's hard to remember which cards are in the deck and which cards are more valuable. I feel like Battle Line, Jaipur, and many similar games do a better job.

Bleh. Sold.

I bought this for my kids because of its theme and colorful package.  I wasn't expecting a deep experience, but if you play the variant rules of laying cards on either your or your opponent's side, this becomes one fun, tough game.  Rounds are quick and there are great decisions to make.  Throw it an imbalance of colored candy and there is just the right amount to think about during a game- and contrary to other comments, the red candy is actually the most common and each medal card is earned when one player has more than half of that colored candy (ie, there are 13 red candy pieces and it takes 7 to earn the medal card).  Very balanced little game that almost beats out Battleline as my favorite 2-player card game.

I feel bad giving this a 6 given that it's closer to the designer's original vision compared to Balloon Cup.  I just think Balloon Cup is the better game.  First, the colors in Pinata are just off, especially on the cards.  I love bold and bright colors.  The problem is 1)blending of the candy pieces against the boards and 2)the artwork on the cards is just wrong, almost creepy looking.  The boy on the card looks close to being clip art.

But these are mostly appearances.  Some would say the Pinata theme is more fitting.  The candy is more thematic than cubes, but the awards are not.  Who gets awards for collecting candy?  So do you want thematic candy you gather from the pinata or the theme of getting awards for the fastest balloon?  For me the balloons make more sense even if the cubes don't.  

Most importantly, the cards are distributed differently.  The designer intended Pinata to be more family friendly and less cut throat. I'm not a fan of that.  I'd rather just play Balloon Cup even if I'm playing in a casual setting.  It's not as if Balloon Cup is that deep or cut throat, either.  Pinata just feels toooo mellow.  Combined with the art and colors I'm just not that interested.

A nice two player game from the designer of Balloon Cup.

In our opinion this is the better of the two thanks to the fact that there's a little twist compared to its predecessor: you can't play cards on your opponent's side before finishing the total amount of cards needed at your own side.

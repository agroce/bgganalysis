RATING: 8
Baseball is just a (way) over-rated artificial game made up by Americans because, well, they have to have a sport that they invented and they have a chance at winning the "World Series" in. Right?
Well you may not agree but I AM right. But thankfully someone did invent it because if they hadn't, we wouldn't have this wonderful little game

Unlike a majority (?), I didn't find this game very compelling. It seems overly narrow to me somehow: single, double, triple, home run. The idea the home player gets the final play - and the visitor only gets a blind draw or their on-deck to block it. Feels unbalanced on that point. I like the play by play idea of cards. I dislike the idea of robots and cyborgs in my beloved American pastime. I will play it a few more times - perhaps tossing in the expansions for some more variety. So we'll see. But so far, rather blah.

I just love this game.  It really captures the feel of the sport in a fast-playing, exciting, and strategic game.

The thing I like most about this game mechanically is that it has taken the deck building mechanism and made the playing of each hand matter.  In most deck builders, you draw a hand and then drop it on the table.  Sometimes the order you play cards in matters, but only in regards to the other cards in your hand.  BH2045 introduces counter-play to the deck building genre, where you have to watch what your opponent is doing and react to it.  I haven't played another deck builder where this is part of the game, and that is what I feel is so innovative about BH2045.

I'm a great baseball fan and get the references but the theme is really well integrated into this game and it just plays really well. Really however this is a 2-player game with the introduction of a tournament system with more players. As such, I don't think this would see much play in my collection. There also seems to be an inordinate number of expansions.

RATING: 8
+ Through each mini-game, the feeling of playing a baseball game comes through quite well; Evolving your players and building your team up from game to game is very satisfying.
- I wish that there was a greater variety in the way that you could focus and build your team other than just buying the best player that happened to be available at the time.

An excellent deckbuilder!  I love how many choices must be made and how you can tailor your deck over many games.  Lots of variety and fantastic interactions among the cards.  The game also captures the feel of a baseball game without overcomplicating gameplay.  Give it a shot even if you're not a big baseball fan.  The game is very solid and enjoyable.

RATING: 6
1st plays: Not a bad deckbuilder, reminded me of Blood Bowl: Team manager in that you play some cards back and forth countering each other, and whoever had drawn the best hand came out on top. Then between rounds some light deckbuilding and go again. I like alternate-timeline sports games (Bloodbowl, this game, Bill-Lambeer's Combat Basketball etc) because they don't require me to know the actual backstories of real sports. I don't know that this is really my cup of tea, but that's more because I'm not a huge fan of deckbuilders, the game is actually pretty well done.

Not a bad game, just not for me

I like the theme and it makes the game feeling like a sports game but so easy and fun to play! I have the 5 expansions of the Deluxe version which I believe is worth getting. I'm thinking about the next 2 expansions and some more starter teams but they are a bit expensive at the moment...

RATING: 7
For me, deckbuilding is more palatable when it's a sub-system of a larger game rather than the whole game.  Baseball Highlights is a deck builder; the players in your starting hand are the equivalents of Dominion's copper and estates.  The object is to build a stronger hand of cards that combine well together, while stripping out the dross.  So far so-so.  The joy of the game lies in the fast-playing matches in-between the card improvement, in which your ever strengthening deck is tested out against an opponent's.  Your deck may be good, but here's where you find out if it's built to beat the other guy's.

Production quality is excellent.  As a leftie I particularly appreciate the two-sided player boards.  My one criticism of the artwork is of some jokey steam-driven robots - I'd like to have imagined that this future world was plausible.  The rules could have explained a little more, especially for the benefit of us non-baseball fans.

RATING: 4
Wow, did not like this. Not a baseball guy for one, and the rules weren't clear when I learned it, but still: it felt like the slowest deck builder ever. You get a new card after three innings? And the variation on the cards is quite astounding, so if you get a good one: good luck!

RATING: 8
Από τα λίγα που έχω δει το baseball μου φαίνεται ένα από τα πιο βαρετά αθλήματα που υπάρχουν αλλά ποτέ δεν λέω όχι σε δοκιμή άγνωστου παιχνιδιού οπότε έκατσα να παίξω. :p Ο κάθε παίκτης αναλαμβάνει μια ομάδα μπέιζμπολ με ρόστερ 15 παικτών. Επειδή το παιχνίδι είναι και sci-fi έχει μέσα και cyborgs αλλά και ρομπότ. Το artwork είναι retro και βγάζει μια 50s αισθητική που προσωπικά μου αρέσει. Τα ρομπότ για παράδειγμα είναι σαν κουβάδες με ένα ρόπαλο. :cool:
  
Ήμασταν 4 άτομα οπότε αρχίσαμε πρωταθληματάκι με 9 αγωνιστικές όπου αντιμετωπίζεις τον κάθε παίκτη 3 φορές. Στο τέλος κάθε αγωνιστικής με βάση τις εισπράξεις από τον αγώνα μπορείς να αγοράσεις κανούργιους παίκτες και διώχνεις άλλους ώστε το ρόστερ να παραμένει πάντα 15 άτομα. Deck building δηλαδή. Οι καινούργιοι μπαίνουν πάνω πάων στην τράπουλα και έτσι είναι άμεσα διαθέσιμοι στον επόμενο αγώνα. Προφανώς ο κάθε παίκτης έχει άλλες ικανότητες. Υπάρχει μεγάλη ποικιλία και αρκετοί εξειδικευμένοι παίκτες που είναι πχ άριστοι εναντίων ρομπότ αλλά δυσκολεύονται σε άλλη περίπτωση. :p

Την ώρα του αγώνα τραβάς τις πρώτες 6 κάρτες από το ρόστερ και παίζεις με αυτές. Οι κάρτες παίζονται μια μια και προσπαθείς με χτυπήματα να σκοράρεις. Άλλοι παίκτες είναι καλύτεροι σαν αμυντικοί ώστε να κόβουν χτυπήματα, άλλοι είναι γρήγοροι ώστε να κάνουν τον γύρο πιο γρήγορα κλπ. Στην αρχή δεν κατάλαβα τι ακριβώς γίνεται αλλά τελικά τα πράματα είναι απλά και το mini game κυλάει γρήγορα. Ουσιαστικά είναι σαν mind game, το πότε θα χρησιμοποιήσεις τον καλό σου αμυντικό και τα λοιπά. Είναι όλα θέμα timing. Υπάρχει και η δυνατότητα να κρατήσεις έναν παίκτη κρυφά stand by στην αρ΄χη του αγώνα και έτσι είτε τον χρησιμοποιείς κάποια στιγμή κατά την διάρκεια του αγώνα είτε τον αφήνεις εκεί και τον έχεις διαθέσιμο στο επόμενο ματς. ;)
  
Μετά τις 9 αγωνιστικές τελειώνουν και οι αγορές και αρχίζουν τα play-offs με τον πρώτο της βαθμολογίας να αντιμετωπίζει τον τέταρτο και ο δεύτερος τον τρίτο με πλεονέκτημα έδρας σε αγώνες best of three, στις 2 νίκες δηλαδή. Μετά ακολουθεί ο τελικός στις 3 νίκες (best of five). Καλή φάση. Το όλο παιχνίδι μας πήρε λίγο πάνω από 2 ώρες. Από ένα σημείο και μετά πωρώνεσαι και αρχίζεις να βλέπεις τι έχουν αγοράσει οι υπόλοιποι ώστε να κάνεις και συ ανάλογες αγορές.     

Το παιχνίδι φαίνεται να περνάει πολύ καλά το θέμα του, την δουλειά του την κάνει πολύ καλά, αλλά όπως είπα δεν είμαι γνώστης του αθλήματος. Το κουτί περιλαμβάνει και έξτρα επεκτασούλες όπως κάρτες προπονητών που μπορούν να χρησιμοποιηθούν μια φορά σε όλη την σεζόν, έξτρα παίκτες με καινούργιες ικανότητες και άλλα.  Αυτά δεν τα δοκίμασα. 

Ανέλπιστα καλό deck building game με πολύ ενδιαφέρον gameplay. Έχει και στρατηγικές αποφάσεις (τι στυλ ομάδα θέλω να φτιάξω) αλλά και τακτικές αποφάσεις κατά την διάρκεια του αγώνα. Προφανώς θα προτιμούσα να είχε θέμα άλλο σπορ πχ βόλεϊ ή μπάσκετ αλλά μάλλον αυτό θα αργήσει να γίνει καθώς είναι πιο δύσκολα στην προσομοίωση τους.  Δοκιμάστε το!

This one is great, whether you're a fan of baseball or not. The games are fun and exciting, it gives you tough decisions to make and feels very tactical. Three player works surprisingly well too (though I still prefer 2 and 4 player sessions). I have only the base set which seems balanced; I'm looking forward to picking up the rest of the mini-expansions.

Edit: This one is a blast. People who don't care for baseball love it. The mechanics are absolutely brilliant.

RATING: 8.2
A killer innovation on deckbuilding which is played out over a series of mini-games, involving a great strategic back & forth that simulates a baseball game quite well. The thing is, the drafting of new players is 'long term' so you'll want to play a series of matches to really feel the strength of the game, which simulates a season. As someone who has not been entirely thrilled with baseball since he was a kid, I found the futuristic theme with robots & cyborgs refreshing, and there are a number of play variants included in the rules.

I genuinely don't understand the appeal of this game at all. I kept hearing about what a great deck builder this was (particularly for solo play) and how the game had this great baseball feel. The solo version of the game is basically the deck-building version of war as far as I'm can see. This was just super boring.

Absurdly good. You want to take hours of downtime, throw them out the window, and just cut to the "highlights"? This is the game.

Plays brilliantly for 1,2,3,4...16 players. 

It is a master achievement for the designer. Clearly well thought out, and a blast to play for baseball fans and those not familiar with baseball alike.

I bought this game for the possibility to make tournaments.

RATING: 8
In a single "game", it's difficult to see how you aren't just being played by the cards in your hand rather than the other way around.  But over a few rounds - once you have started to build up your team - the game really starts to hum. 

Some people have cautioned that people who don't care for baseball might not be the right audience for this game.  I really enjoy Baseball Highlights despite the fact that I consider the real-world sport to be pretty dull.

Based on numerous solo plays (including the app) this is a brilliant game. Despite the AI simply being a random draw of 15 cards, the number of times that I've felt as if a real player was sat across from me is ridiculous. And the excitement of winning a World Series on the final card of an extra innings in the seventh game is amazing. With various expansions purchased but yet to play, this is going to spend a long time at the solo gaming table. But with the kids beginning to show a lot of interest, face-to-face play is not far away.

RATING: 4
The more I play the game, the less I enjoy the rock-paper-scissors of playing out your hand (e.g., playing the current game of baseball). The drafting and deck setup is where most of the game's fun is (e.g., OK, my opponent didn't play his crazy good robot card this game, so it's likely that its coming next game; let's try to draft a counter card), but its such a short portion of the overall game play.

Edit, Nov 2017: yeah, if I want rock-paper-scissors, I'll play some C&C: Napoleonics. I don't find the simplicity of the rock-paper-scissors in this game to be that compelling.

The mechanics all work and there's a LOT of personality here, but I'm not sure how deep the game is.

Played the solo game and it works well as a way of getting familiar with the rules whilst at the same time providing an interesting challenge.  If you take Rock Paper Scissors and played it against a random number generator most of what is interesting about the game would be lost.  With Baseball Highlights its not that extreme as you can still have a fun job drafting to find the right cards to counter the AI once you start discovering what cards it has and there is still the challenge of how best to play your cards against what the AI might turn over .... but there is certainly something lost.  Still enjoyed my play and with different numbers of drafts first (and different expansions to add) can see this getting some more solo as well as multiplayer plays.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Enjoyed it just as much on the second play. Really rewards paying attention to your opponent's deck composition. Perhaps moreso than in any other deckbuilder.

OLD COMMENT: Perhaps a bit generous with this rating this soon. But Baseball Highlights has legs.

I expected the deckbuilding aspect, with the mini-games feeding into and being fed in return by a Dominion-like 'Buy' pool. What I DIDN'T expect was the delectable mind game hidden beneath the surface of the placid deckbuilding lake.

Within a half dozen plays, I expect the algebra of the mini-game card play would become rote. In the same way as everyone knows the various combinations of opening plays in Dominion, depending upon the opening hand(s). But because of the ways in which these basic hands interact with one another in Baseball Highlights, you have a much more reactive game from the get-go.

In Dominion, this isn't nearly as in-your-face. It feels more subtle. Your 4-3 treasure split allows a slightly different starting purchase rhythm than your opponent's 5-2 split. In Baseball Highlights, the difference of a single Veteran defensive ability can mean the difference between a 3-3 game going to extra innings and a 3-2 victory.

The economic system also rewards winning by as little as possible, because lower power cards provide a greater compensation in free agent purchasing power. So, if you win by using slightly higher powered players, you will only have slightly less money for purchasing better players that round. If you use all of your very good players to destroy an opponent in a game, you end up having very little purchasing power and your opponent can purchase a much better new card for the next game. This incentive creates tighter games with more drama.

Anyway, this is all to say that there are multiple levels to thinking about your plays beyond a simple streamlining and improvement of the deck composition. It could be the thickest-textured pure deckbuilder ever.

So many of my boardgaming friends (online and in person) have told me this game is good. Now that I've played it, I can say that I agree. I like the quick-playing games which are extremely well integrated with the theme of baseball. I liked deck-building my own baseball team over the course of games to get myself to the point where I could try and set up the right combos in a championship series. My dad is a big baseball fan and if I could get him to play this with me, I would buy it in an instant.

This one really does feel like playing baseball!  When i saw some of the previews for this game and the reviews I was pretty skeptical, but this is a really neat deck / hand building game, with a really neat baseball feel.  I do agree with what I have heard from most other people, and that is you really need to be into the theme to enjoy this one.  One I don't think would be worth picking up, as I would never get to play it, but one I would like to play more.  I would also like to check out the 4p version of the game!

I had never heard of this but my buddy, Allen, brought it over for a play. Despite the theme doing not much for me and my not being a deck building junkie, the game really charmed me. It is very clever how the theme of baseball meshes perfectly with the deckbuilding mechanisms here, though. Everything holds together so well, the game plays so cleanly, that you get a lot more game than seems to be asked. It's very diverting - and with lots of flexibility for different lengths and styles of play. I haven't quite made my mind up on the futuristic, steam-punk elements, but they're in keeping with the light spirit. I have it as a seven...perhaps it could be an eight with more plays.

I enjoyed this. It's fast, clever, and has a creative and amusing theme. Although certain things are not quite right (both teams bat and pitch at the same time), for the most part I thought it did a decent job simulating baseball. 

The main downside is the very heavy dose of randomness. Expect a quick, fun, casual game, not any strategic depth.

The decision to include the Red Sox instead of the Angels in the base set was also regrettable. :)

I hate Baseball. That might be, because I didn't grow up with the sport but I don't feel the excitement... it's boring as hell.

This game, however, brings fun to the concept of Ring Around the Rosie. It somehow creates a similar feeling to Blood Bowl Team Manager, which I absolutely love.

Really cool game, good production quality, cool artwork (although the artwork on the box is waaaaay better than the one in the game).

I love baseball and I've been on a bit of a baseball game kick lately and Baseball Highlights: 2045 did not disappoint. The game started off pretty slowly and lackluster, but as the game progressed and your team was upgraded we really started to enjoy it. While the game claims to support up to four players, I don't think I'd ever play with more then two.

7/7/2017 - Played a full world series with Doug last night, and lost 4 games to 3. It was a very close match. I enjoy the game very much, but I'm not sure how many other players besides Doug I could ever get to regularly play it. So I'm removing it from my wishlist for now, especially since I can play to my heart's content on the app version of the game.

Unless you're Monte Cook - and you're not - any fantasy game world you come up with is going to be a much less interesting setting for a game than real history.

And so it is with the weird retro-future baseball world of this game; I know the MLB licensing is a bitch, but still, just making a game about baseball with the serial numbers filed off would have been so much more interesting. Instead, we've got cyborgs, robots, and natural players not for any rational reason, but because the designer needed a thematic rationalization for a mechanical element the game seems to need (players who aren't very good but produce a lot of revenue). And then the players are named with silly-sounding mixes of real player names for reason that are not clear, other than perhaps to remind you this really is baseball?

This sort of thing bugs me more than it used to. Mechanically clever games that evoke nothing in particular or explore no thematic idea have now been done to death; they are of very little interest to me anymore. Additionally, straight-ahead deck-builders (which this clearly is) have now passed their best-before date, and it's not clear to me what this adds to the genre other than an awkward name.

Which brings me back to my argument about the real world. History is replete with fascinating periods and themes that can be explored through the medium of gaming. Baseball itself has a rich tradition. Explore that instead of making up this sort of silly nonsense.

Anyway. That ended up being a bit more rant-y than I expected, and I haven't actually played it yet so maybe it'll win me over. I'd like to give it a try. But it's a bit pricey so I won't buy it personally, and most people I know will probably think the setting too silly to bother with.

Oh, and also, the rules are a mess. Never a good sign.

I thought the game did a great job of getting rid of the boring parts that usually bog down most baseball board/card game and also got rid of the bluffing usually inherent in the pitching/hitting aspect.

However, I didn't really feel like it was much a deck builder.  It was more just buying the best player(s) available rather than trying to build a team that works well together.  Some of the expansions seem to fix that by giving bonuses based on other players in play, but the base game seemed more about individual players than team play.

I did really enjoy how every card play was not only to try to negate what your opponent did, but also create for yourself.  It was neat trying to figure out when to play each player in this way.  Do I use this powerful guy now, or wait until he may also be useful on defense?

Overall, a fun little beer and pretzels weight game.  Pretty random in that you only have 6 cards per mini-game, and some times you're just going to have a bad mini-game based on the draw, but each one plays quickly and you play a bunch of them, so it works out OK.

This might be the best baseball simulator out there, but I'm not sure that's saying much. I was just never particularly interested in my decisions. Like, well, I need to block that hit, so I'll play this card. I have three runners on base, so I'll play this card. I have a leadoff card in hand, so I'll play that one first. Now, people have said that there are many layers to think about during play and I believe them, I just didn't find myself invested enough to delve deep and find them. I think I was just hoping, as I do every time cards have text on them, that exciting things would happen. But all the cards are, I don't know, kind of dull.

A blast to play from start to finish. I like the multi-layered card management decisions from strength/money to pinch hitting and some other sneaky ways to cycle the deck more quickly and with balance. There is some luck involved to be sure, but paying close attention to the cards your opponent has pays off. 

The theme is great and it captures the essence of baseball well. I would have preferred the robots and cyborgs be just lefties and power hitters or something less offputting to regular people (who I would definitely otherwise be able to play this with), but you can't have it all.

Rock-Paper-Scissors Card Drafting Build Game, fun fun game, but too much box for such a simple card game. I don't plan on buying all expansions so I would have preferred a more compact version.

Most of the cards seem to lack personality, except the robots, robots are powerful and always have overwhelming effects.

Not a fan of the "steam-punk americana" art style chosen even if it kind of goes along with the vintage baseball theme. For the robots, I would prefer the badass look from the cover.

A decent deck builder with a unique theme that plays great with two. You are playing a series of mini games with your deck trying to win a world series. After each game you can buy new cards for your deck and replace the weaker cards. The new cards go on top of your deck so you know you will have them for the next game. What holds this game back for me is the turn structure constantly going back and forth with each card played and keeping track of what needs to happen was a little confusing to me on the first play. I imagine it would get better with repeated plays though. The other problem for me is the defensive cards that negate the offensive cards, they felt so random coming out it was really hard to try and strategize about what card to play from your hand of 6 for that game. Each card play feels so important but it really hurts when multiple cards get shutdown seemingly every game. I would be willing to play this again but I know for these reasons my wife would not enjoy it so it's unfortunately leaving my collection.

Baseball Highlights 2045 is a casual one-on-one kard kombat deckbuilder (with a central market of single unique cards, cf. Dominion's market of 10 kingdom cards with 10 identical cards available to everyone) of the sort I generally do not like (cf. Ascension and Star Realms). The baseball theme helps a bit but the theme can be fairly accused of being [i]pasted on[/i] if you are going in expecting an actual simulation of baseball. Where the baseball rigmarole does add real value is in providing a useful metaphor for scoring and partial scoring that absent the metaphor would be unnecessarily complex. Liking baseball is not a requirement, a rudimentary understanding of the game illuminates much, but in-depth understanding of the game is unnecessary except for being amused by the allusions in the names of free agent cards.

But, yes, this is still fundamentally a deckbuilder, and yet it improves on the standard deckbuilding formula in one key aspect: [b]hand management is in the house[/b]. The order of the cards you play matters a great deal. Dominion is a solid game of strategic intrigue that does not require interesting nitty-gritty tactical decisionmaking because the games are short enough that once you're at a reasonably high level, you're just trying to see who has the better strategic vision given the kingdom cards in play. The Ascension/Star Realms version of deckbuilding sacrifices this long-term strategic look-ahead without adding much tactical interest. With BH2045, there's still some strategy but the tactical void has been replaced with a back-and-forth card-by-card duel of cut and thrust that is as good as the one provided by, say, Twilight Struggle. And you can play a seven-game series in like 45 minutes. And roaring back from a 3-1 deficit in that series feels so good.

Like popcorn, this one is. Downside is that if you really want the full experience, you'll need to invest in some expansions. But it's worth it. Bleev me.

Bought the Android app. I just don't find the gameplay very enjoyable. I've played a ton of baseball simulation games in my life, such as Pursue the Pennant. This is a "just ok" game that is baseball themed. With some robots thrown in. Weird and not fun to an actual fan of baseball. Maybe this is how dragons feel when they hear nerds talking about Dungeons & Dragons.

Gameplay is quick, with tactical cancelling out of opponents hits and capitalizing on the board state. Has a nice rock-paper-scissors feel to it that keeps the best cards from being too dominant. The AI is a decent challenge at first but eventually I played enough to beat it every time (though not always a sweep)

Wow! This game has a lot more going on that it would seem by explanation, rule-book, and first play! This is a fantastic game solo, 2p, and 4p. It's a blast to build your team and try to win the series against your buddies or the AI.  And although it is a Deckbuilder, it doesn't feel like a DB. You are only adding a few players to your deck over the course of the season/series, so it is more like you are fine-tuning your strategy against your opponent by making a few tweaks rather than your typical DB feel.  Also, this game really and truly comes down to hand-management and TIMING! It's about flexible strategy and finely executed tactics.  I can know by the look of my hand (Draw) what order I want to play my cards, but inevitably, it's about looking up from your cards, into the eyes of your opponent and being ready to respond to whatever they throw at you! You will know their deck and part of their hand each round, but there is always that on-deck card to worry about and not being sure about HOW your opponent might play his or her cards this round! 

This is a game for everyone.  Forget baseball (although my buddies that love Baseball love this game), I have taught it to people who hate America's lost pasttime and love the game and how everything works together.  When it is game 7 in the series and you both have a single card in your hand while the score is tied or within 2 points, you signal to the pitcher to hold, step back out of the box, look up to the sky while making the sign of the cross. you Kiss your hand, dig into the dirt and hope that you read your opponent well enough to make this last play a home run!

Head to head deck building where you take turns playing cards against each other playing 6 card games building your teams and then playing a best of 7. Can get a little confusing on what actions take place when but nothing too difficult. There's lot of expansions to add to this game and you can play 4 player in a playoff format. I enjoyed it but I like the deck builders where you play multiple cards triggering abilities for the previous cards better.

No one makes card games like Mike Fitzgerald.

Excellent deck-building baseball game.  Lots of ways to come up with variations of how to pick up better players through game plays and drafting.  Lots of exciting moments and finishes, from walk-off runs to defensive saves.  I have the "naturals" expansion but will soon get the robots and cyborgs ones too.  Very fun game.  

It doesn't feel like a deck-building game.  I think the key is to use your own formula to figure out how to work out drafting, and then play whatever types of series you'd like.  It's (maybe/maybe not) designed with that in mind.

Bottom line though, really fun game.  There are usually great, tense finishes to games.

Clever deck building game themed on futuristic baseball, where teams are a mix of humans, cyborgs and robots.  Robots are great hitters, cyborgs are the pitchers, and humans are all rounders.  You begin with a generic deck of rookies and veterans, and play "games" of baseball against your opponent - essentially a 3 minute affair of Yomi combined with table tennis.  Then the fun part - you draft free agents in to your deck, and send the chaff off the minor leagues - so your team is instantly stronger for the next game.  

Fresh, fun, and certainly feels a little bit different.  Unfortunately the rules fail to explain a few crucial points, but the FAQ and some cogitating get you there.  Fun solitaire game included against a deck of free agents.  Enjoying it so far.

I'm a huge fan of Mike Fitzgerald games; his Al Capone Myster Rummy has been an enduring classic in my household for 12 years! 

Gameplay *sounds* like something I would like, but the artwork, expansions, "steampunk" veneer, kickstart funding, and asking price all are turn-offs.

I can't help but think that the underlying game (Fitzgerald) is probably in my wheelhouse, but the production (Eagle/Fred/Gryphonne/whatever-the-fuck this unholy alliance is this year) made it a nonstarter.

Played a partial game. This game might shine with players who play it enough to become familiar with the decks, but I don't feel a strong desire to get there. Threatened runners would seem to generate tension, but they didn't in my play. The rules are written poorly, and so much information you need to get a hunch for your odds is hard to access. Also has the "dwindling hand" problem, where you know the last few cards aren't going to help you, but you have to play through them anyway.

I am a huge fan of Dominion. And in my view no deck builder has ever got close to Dominion. Baseball Highlights is the first time I have played a deck builder, other than the big D, and really enjoyed the experience. The downside is that to play well you really need to memorise what cards your opponent is holding in his deck. I have a terrible memory and so for me the play was rather random. 

Still, a clever and entertaining 2 player card game.

Grrrr....this was by far the biggest disappointment of Geekway 2017 for me. As a baseball fan I had such high hopes for this, but it falls flat as just another game simulator. The quirky hook (Baseball was too boring by 2045 so they added cyborgs and robots) is mildly offensive. It clearly is added because Baseball on its own is too subtly cerebral for gamers, who need to have robots or space ships or elves or goblins or aliens added to keep their interest. Cripes, I'm surprised they didn't add a moon princess in a bikini shagging fly balls to the game.

The game isn't a total loss; it plays quickly and easily (although it takes a while to get used to resolving "threatened hits" on your opponents next turn).  But the three mini games with mostly starter cards is a little tedious. There's not nearly enough drafting in this game.

There are inside "jokes" that Baseball fans might enjoy (all the name mashups, rivalries of the base game cities, and what is clearly Ted Williams' swing on the box). But I don't think it's enough to draw Baseball fans into the gaming world.

It's not like I went into this game expecting to hate it, thus creating a self-fulfilling prophesy. I wanted to love it. I wanted to introduce my gaming buddies to the world of baseball...something I've tried to do rather unsuccessfully for years. I wanted this game to be a catalyst for Geekway to add Stratomatic  (et al) to their library. I wanted this to be a new classic.

Alas, I wanted too much.

Despite the fact that the game is not structured at all like a real baseball game, it manages to feel like a real baseball game. There isn't a clear transition between offense and defense, nor are strikes or outs tracked, but players must still manage the bases, and the strengths of their team. Players can build a defensively proficient team, and hope to score a few runs in a small ball style, or stock up on sluggers and try to bludgeon their opponent with homeruns. The game ends up feeling like a rock-paper-scissors match, and to play well a good memory (of your opponent's deck)is needed, which is an aspect of games I rather dislike. All in all though, this is a surprisingly fun sports themed deck builder.

As a fan of deckbuilders this is one of the best. It is tight, tense and dramatic and very interactive unlike most other deckbuilding games. Everything seems balanced and players need skill and a bit of luck to win- and even that luck can be mitigated. 
Whilst abstract the theme is still very strong and this is arguably the best sports themed game on the market at the moment.

I really enjoyed my initial plays.  It's really a unique take on deckbuilding and the meta elements of the draft really work well.  Unfortunately, though, further play has left me feeling a bit dissatisfied. I wouldn't call the offer cards unbalanced, but some clearly favor extant synergies and combos, which can hamper you if your opponent gains access to favorable cards while you do not.  Meanwhile, the "baseball game" portion can feel a little bit scripted and obvious.  There can be a little bit of bluffing and second guessing, but I find it to be circumstantial.  

I still enjoy the game.  It's pleasant.  It just doesn't have the depth of play I'm after in 1v1 card games.

I really wanted a deck building game, but most of the pure deck builders don't interest me as much because they don't involve much card play at all, mostly revolving around engine building through the card market instead. On your turn you'd just lay down your whole hand at once, which is kinda boring. On the other hand, BH:2045 is mostly all about the card play, with deck building as a significant supporting mechanic. This is a very tactical "take-that" style game, where you must plan out the best way to play your hand, while trying to be flexible enough to respond to your opponents actions. Long term strategy emerges as you become familiar with the game and can learn to build your deck with comboing cards and considerations of how your opponent is building theirs. It's an interesting game, that plays quickly and is lighter on rules. The card play reminds me of a trick-taking game like Euchre, which isn't surprising considering the designer.

I don't think I will have a difficult time getting this to the table with my close friends & family who I know all like baseball anyway. I purchased most of the Free Agent expansions and all of the teams which have a significance to myself, friends & family.

A deckbuilding game with a futuristic steampunk (as incongruous as that sounds) baseball theme that is unique enough in terms of how it does deckbuilding as well as implements the baseball theme that I don't think you need to be a fan of either to enjoy the game.

You have a team of 15 cards that you can play for offense, defense, or (the best cards) both. Both the home team and the visiting team can each put a card in the whole for one last play (home team for offense, visiting team for defense). Then after the game, you can use the cards you played that game to purchase a new card(s). It's easy to knock out a multiple game series in under an hour.

Intersting use of deck building with full use of card text.

Plays smoothly with interesting consequences for successive turns over the match. I wish the art was more prominent on the cards, but it doesn't detract.

[b]This was my Game-of-the-Year for 2015! Owned and will acquire all expansions.

Rating history: 10|10|10|10|10..........[/b]

[b]JAN/16[/b]
I'm a huge fan of the base game, and we finally rolled into the later expansions. I feel this expansions are pricey, but the variety does help the game. However! some of the text formatting and sentence structure on the new expansion packs are astoundingly terrible. And one or two ability (Checks, specifically), don't feel that fun to me. Nevertheless, this is a Top 5 game for me, so more is better.

[b]AUG/15[/b]
First solo play. Four buy rounds.

Game 1: The Yankees ran out to a 2-0 lead, and threatened to put it out of reach later with a 2-run homer, but Giambi came up big and robbed the Home Run. A steady stream of singles and doubles put my Dodgers back in it 2-2. In extra innings, the solid hitting was too much for the Yankees: they did manage another 2-run homer to go up 4-2, but the Dodgers answered with a bases loaded triple to win 5-4 and take Game 1 of the World Series.

Game 2: With the extra revenue I generated from extra innings in Game 1, I was able to take on two new players to support my weak draw deck. The game never felt that close: I went up early with a few clean hits and a home run, then the AI came roaring back, but with two runners on base heading into extra innings versus the AI's one runner, things were looking good. Game 1 hero, Giambi robbed the AI of their home-run and then belted one of his own. 9-6, Giants take a 2-0 lead in the series. Sales  of Giambi jerseys skyrockets.

Game 3: San Francisco is back at home after two road wins. The Yankees run up to 7-4, but SF looks good for a comeback. Bases loaded and three consecutive hits threatened which would tie the game! AI flips Gooden who turns the S-S-D into W-W-W, turning what would have been a 8-7 win into a 6-7 loss. Yankees take a game, but are down 1-2 in the series.

I played this once.  I have a feeling that there is a whole bunch of depth here and might very well deserve better than a 6.5 from me.... So I gave it a 7 but this could be a 9 or a 10 if it is as deep as I think and the person who plays it loves baseball and board games.  

The need to play this again while typing this is growing.... maybe I should raise it to 7.5

Baseball Highlights: 2045, like TransAmerica, scales really well from a quick filler to a longer match-play affair. While a single hand is fun, the game really shines as a best-of-7 series match with a player acquisition phase between games. Our matches tend to always go to game 7!

EDIT:  It's 2016 and I'm still playing this.  What a fantastic game this is.  I never dreamed I could get a game that would cram a World Series into one hour or so without abstracting it so much it doesn't feel like baseball anymore.  

The light deckbuilding is perfect for representing coaching and lineup decisions and you can watch your team improve slowly but surely with every game.  Game 1 you're struggling to bring more than a run or two in, but late in the series you'll have the bases juiced and threaten bombastic homeruns.

Just a great, great game.

---------------

I actually like this quite a bit.  My rating could go higher.

Mixes very fast card play, light deck/team-building, a decent amount of optimal/hate/counter drafting, and satisfying "realistic" baseball scores to create a very thrilling experience.  The deluxe edition has lots of expansions, but I'd start with just the basics, as you will only get into a fraction of the "main deck" even after playing a 3-of setup series and then the best of 7 World Series.

Also?  Game box accommodates sleeved cards and lots of room for future expansions, something I am always, always appreciative of.

Lowlights:
(1) Not all of the abilities seem balanced with each other, or even particularly good
(2) There is a lot of sequence luck - you can have the perfect answer to their best card and not benefit as they draw their power card in different games than you draw your answer

There's a few games that I will never turn down a game of. Baseball Highlights 2045 is one of them. I positively adore this game.

It's currently my favorite:

- 2 Player Game
- Deckbuilder
- Sports Themed Game

The minigame play is thematic and mechanically original. The active and reactive play is also very fun. I also love the deeper mechanic of the deck planning and building. The game thrives as a 2 player game since you can plan and react to your opponent's buys.

Played twice solo after buying it for its unique theme.  It helps that I love sports and would love to have a great sports board game.  Honestly, believe it or not, this is the best deckbuilder I have ever played.  It's exciting, it's tense, and the games are so fast that you're on to the next game quickly.  Everything is well-executed - the artwork, the theme, the mechanics, the buy-in rounds, the building up of the team over the course of a series.  I have never been this much in awe of a game design this quickly.

It's in the future, but it's also steam-powered and everyone is wearing old timey uniforms. Anyway, looks good and I'm looking forward to trying it. Not sure why they went with plastering the name of the game on the middle of the playing field. My other complaint is that the expansions really should have been just included with the game. You don't get a lot for the money, and these really were just held back it seems for the sake of the Kickstarter. In the end you're getting a very expensive deck of cards, some player boards and pawns.

Overly mechanical and highly random due to the paucity of meaningful choices. I also dislike the graphic style. I'd much rather play the very similar Blood Bowl Team Manager (and I don't especially want to play Blood Bowl Team Manager).

I'm completely baffled by the design decision to play three "regular season" games before the real game even starts. Winning these games is almost completely meaningless. If there is an advantage that goes to the home team (I'm unsure), it will only favor the regular season winner if the World Series goes 7 games. Because of the 2-3-2 format, the regular season loser will actually have the home field advantage through five games. Why not skip the regular season and instead perform three rounds of drafting before the World Series starts?

One play with two. I enjoyed myself quite a bit, but it's not clear to me how deep it is. Are there strategies in the drafting of players, or do you just always pick the best-looking ones you can afford? Would a strategy depend on remembering which cards your opponent has drafted (a level of effort I would never put into a game like this)?

But, like I said, I did enjoy myself.

Had been avoiding this game for awhile. Not a huge fan of baseball or most deck builders. This game surprised me though, and even though I ended up playing with a creepy racist, I still enjoyed myself and had a good time (probably partly because I won). Guess Baseball really is the game that brings people together. You really do get the sense that it's your wit versus the other persons, in a more strategy card game way than you get from games such as Dominion, with just enough abstraction to make both the card and spatial aspects of the game work like a well oiled bionic arm.

While Baseball Highlights doesn't bring anything incredibly new to the table, the way it brings together deck-building and special abilities is incredibly slick. If you're at all remotely familiar with baseball, everything seems to fit in place thematically and mechanically (e.g., recruiting, economy) -- so much so that it is, for me, the most thematic multi-player deckbuilder out there in which the theme marries the mechanics. 

The (thematically) small hand size as well as the fixed deck size also means that it doesn't devolve into economic snowballs or degenerate deck-trimming strategies. I also appreciate the lean in to collectively discuss "hires" (even if it makes for a slower game) as it means that it's like sports panelists discussing which player the team *should* pick. It's a great leisurely way to spend a few hours -- with so many highs and lows, I also feel like even "striking out" in this game is to have "swung the bat" -- a good spit-in-hand-handshake to finish the game. 

The only qualm I have about the game is the monstrous home-plate sized box.

Played a 4 player tournament, 6 games total (2 against each other player). Really smooth experience, very quick considering the numerous rounds.

Cool game. The theme, the quickness, the uncommon (but not complicated!) turn phases. It's a bit lighter than I thought it would be – at least on the surface, probably there's more strategy in the deck-building with experienced opponents. I'd love to try out more of the expansions, and maybe join a tournament. So far I've only played the digital (Android) version, and not vs. a real human.

When I explain the basic mechanics and theme to someone, this game doesn't sound that great.  But if I can get someone to try it, it becomes an engaging experience.  I like deck-builders well enough; I am not a baseball fan and yet, this game is a blast.  I love how quickly any given match plays out.  I love purchasing the free agents to add to my line-up.  As a sci-fi geek, I love the mixing of cyborgs and robots in sports.  The art in the original game is so-so, but the expansions step up the quality significantly.  The cards are super-thick linen-finish and thus very durable and feel great in the hand.  The boards are great as well.  Even the insert is usable!

RATING: 9
:) A surprising amount of tough and interesting decisions to make with a hand of only 6 cards. You have to think about the order of your hits to maximize scoring, when to play your offensive and defensive abilities, and when to play particular cards based on what you know about your opponents hand and roster. You also have to think about how much revenue you're generating, and whether it's worth it to pinch-hit people just to generate more money to buy better cards.

:) Fast and easy resolution. The game speeds along when you and your opponent know it well. The excellent components work well for this.

:) Tournament mode is cool, so it's nice that it actually supports 4 players. (Still need to try 3 players; I should, I'd probably like it.)

:) The solo mode is a lot of fun and easy to adjust difficulty.  The mobile app is also really good and includes an actual AI.

:soblue: The rulebook is lacking in a couple severely important details: resolution of the home team's final card, and the definition of a Walk (both answered in FAQ).  It's been so long since I played or watched baseball that I forgot the exact details of a Walk, so the rulebook should have explained it.

:soblue: Card abilities like Clutch have extra effects that are listed on the player aid but not the cards themselves

The rules remain reasonably simple comparing to tons of meaningful choices in a game. The tempo is really well(good ratio between mini-game & deck-building, also short overall game-length).

I wonder how important it is to play the cards in the right order in mini-game. If the order indeed affects not only the current mini-game but further matches, the game would be great. Need more play to justify the rating.

*The price is just too high(for either base-game or deluxe version)

*For my first game I got some minor wrong rules. I shall blame my wrong-rule playings partly to the rulebooks, which is ok, but requires reader to be careful.

This game has some new and great mechanics, while putting the baseball theme front and center, but still being accessible to those that don't really know the game.  The play of back and forth is engaging, pressure filled and tantilizing.  It teaches relatively easy and can be played quickly and, unlike many deckbuilders, does not have any semblance of solitaire in it.  Mike Fitzgerald and team really did a fantastic job with this one and I hope to see it grow.

I would love to see an official campaign season long variant.  Something that may allow for a little more immersion with individual players and such that wouldn't completely invalidate the starting players.  I would absolutely love to see a larger expansion that set about making that possible.

RATING: 7
This was solid. It has this interesting dynamic where it seems like there are a lot of very powerful cards, but they basically all have counters. So when you're building your roster you really have to be paying attention and remembering what your opponent's best cards are to look for counters to them, while also remembering the kinds of things that will be weak to the cards your opponent already has. The playing of the games themselves, while generally fairly exciting, are maybe a bit lacking in decisions for my taste. And then as it's a card game there's always the possibility that either you don't get the opportunity to buy any good counters to your opponent's best card, or if you do that it won't come out at the right times. This is mostly alleviated by each individual game being really quick so you can play longer series, which also enhances the aspects of tuning your roster to counter your opponent. Also it felt about as true to baseball as a card game of this length could be. I liked it, the only reason I don't rate it higher is that I'm just not a huge fan of this type of game (few decisions, 2 player only, deckbuilder).

A fun game that my son and I look forward to playing.  Great graphics and incredibly balanced. Many of the games are decided by just one or two runs and the series are often tight.  Will be adding expansions.

Played 3 mini games and a series with my son before he leaves for college. Still amazed how balanced almost every game is, but he still swept the series. 

I enjoy playing and the art work, quality is first rate. My only criticism is that the game could feel young because of the theme.  Baseball is used in many games as a theme, many geared to a younger demographic. This game is not necessarily for younger players, in fact some younger players are probably not mature enough to handle the "attack" or defensive cards played in the game. Nonetheless, it could have a young feel. 

Just played a series against the AI.  Went 7 games, each game very close.  Almost beat an offensive juggernaut with great defense.  Incredibly well balanced. 

IOS play is excellent.  Would like to see a stats feature. Would also like to see last card played by opponent after final score posted. For now you can't close the scoreboard.

Each player starts with a personal deck of 15 cards. Players draw a hand of six cards, with the optional opportunity to designate an additional reserve card (the "pinch hitter"). Players alternate playing a card in order to move pawns around a personal track (the bases) or to hinder the other player from doing so on their track. A player wins the hand by moving more pawns around the track than their opponent after all cards are played. The first player to win 4 hands wins the game (best-of-seven).

Cards also have a "revenue" value that, win or lose, you can use to purchase more powerful cards (star players) between hands from a six-card display. These new cards replace cards in your hand so that your deck always stays at 15 cards - hence "deck-improvement" rather than "deck-building". New cards go on top of your draw deck so that you can use them in your next hand. Cards can add up to three pawns to your track ("hits") which move at three different speeds. Before you can move them, however, your opponent can play an "instant action" that can remove some or all of your pawns. Cards may have hits or instant actions (either offensive or defensive) or both. Some can be discarded to activate your reserve card. Some add to your purchasing power, some do not. There is a great variety of cards in this game and it is a core strength of the design.

I have intentionally reduced baseball references and terminology in this write-up because I think they give the wrong impression of what playing this game is like. However, the theme does add a lot to the experience. The idea of a future version of baseball filled with cyborgs and robots with a sort-of retro charm is very cool. The instant action interrupts take a bit of getting used to, but they are what make the game feel unique more than anything. While the game plays in under an hour, there are an impressive number of choices to make, both in the order you play your cards and in the cards you acquire. This is a GREAT two-player card game. The solo-rules are strong as well. Mike's most interesting and innovative card game to date!

RATING: 7
Rating based on about 8-10 plays with the Deluxe edition which adds the Coach/Managers and extra player cards.  Good, quick fun filler game although it looks as if the publisher/designer may already be going a bit overboard on the expansions (a la Dominion).  Well-thought design, great as a two-player game, but not so great with three as the mechanics of player order with three seem a bit clunky.  Strategy, though, is relatively simple:  draft the best players early to try to win the 7-game series in the end.

One piece of advice:  buy the Deluxe Edition which comes with the six original expansion packs.  Hate buying stuff piecemeal, a la Power Grid, Formula De, etc., but afraid that's probably what is going to happen with this game.

This game is more fun than it has any right to be (especially since I am not an enormous fan of baseball to begin with).  The short minigames combined with the larger series format reminds me of GDW's Imperium in how it forces a player to plan for both short term victories and long term roster management.

RATING: 6
On the plus side, Baseball Highlights: 2045 manages to stand out in the flood of games. It brings the feeling of a baseball game to the table in a manageable amount of time. Building your deck after each inning doubles for slowly improving your team. There's a satisfaction to winning an inning with your improved team even if you lose the game.

Nonetheless, the game doesn't fully convince me. It could have benefitted from a bit more mass market compatibility respectively more development. Some of the special abilities are clunky and easily misunderstood. Clutch is the main offender. The theme is too nerdy. Cyborgs and robots mixed in a team with naturals? Why? Unless you're experienced, a full game of three qualifyers that don't count and up to seven matches to determine a winner is too long.

I am not a fan of baseball myself, but the game uses it for theme (and the retro-futuristic aspect is quite awesome) and for its scoring system, which is very interesting. The quick pace and deep interactions through the counter system make this game a very cool two-player experience. However, the 3 plus best of 7 leads to too long a game: I'd rather just do a draft, then best of 3.

I like my sport games and this is a quick act counteract microgame that allows you to improve your deck.  
The theme of baseball is well implemented here.
Cards can grant you instant effects , defensive actions sometimes against particular types of opponents and offensive actions.

this is a game I immediately want to play again. 
I gave this an 8 but up my rating immediately.
Main problem is that this is getting the IoS treatment and games move lightning fast . 
On the other hand I enjoy this too much not to get the deluxe edition to play this face to face

I'm a playtester on this numerous times.  I think its a highly innovative deck-building mechanism layered with several features that make it quick-paced and tension-filled.  You are both GM and field coach, so utilize your strategy and tactics wisely.  

After each baseball game, each team has a chance to draft/demote for better quality players based upon the attendance (income/sales) generated from the game just played.  This allows each player the flexibility to improve their team for future baseball games using the deck-building mechanism.

So, BBH is a series of baseball games as each player pursuits the World Series pennant.  Each baseball game filters (play a card) into a handful of actions that represent the "highlights" of a whole baseball game, rather than a play-by-play simulation (which is usually drawn out and prolonged in excess).  

This game has a distinguishing way in drafting player(s) through deck-building a team (so no two teams are alike), demoting low-quality players for better ones, and a good deal of tactics as you work your path towards a World Series finale.

RATING: 6
"I'm not a fan of baseball at all"...let me just get that out of the way, as many reviews of this game will require it. In fact, the design of the game has helped non-fans of baseball warm to this game by setting it in 2045 and adding robots and cyborgs. So it's okay, it's not baseball, it's sci-fi, though there's no reason it couldn't have just been baseball.

Anyhow, the game is pretty neat, a sort of "Blood Bowl Team Manager" but for the dugout set. You call plays, buy new players (even during the middle of the World Series, which seems kind of odd to me) and the action is meant to be a sort of overview of the inning (a "highlight", if you will) instead of literal pitch-by-pitch action.

It works well, though it kind of needs an action flowchart at first to get used to. The action is pretty quick and interesting and it's not crazy complex. I enjoyed it, but it seems like there could be a little more meat on it.

RATING: 6
This game met my expectations of what I thought I would think of it: good but not as amazing as everyone has been raving about it. However, it is good for reasons different than I would have thought. I thought the mini-games would basically play themselves and the deck building would be the fun part, whereas the mini-games actually requires some careful planning of the ordering of your cards and the deck building felt bland. 

The use of pinch hitters, need to understand which of your powers will get through vs. your opponent, and considerations of do I get to play the last card or does my opponent? Means you have to be quite careful in the order you play your cards.

Considering you can only buy 1 or 2 cards between each mini-game, there wasn't as strong sense of engine building. Sure, 1-2 cards is at least 1/6 of your next game, and the overall composition of your deck once you play a few games will be fairly different from the start, but it doesn't give as an organic feel of your deck slowly but surely growing, and more I am transferring in this major player for my next turn. Also, as someone who isn't that into baseball, the cards while having different strengths felt like variations of similar things. I also think person who lost last should go second in order to counterdraft, rather than person who has more money.

I understand why people who aren't as into deck building like it so much though: it gives some deck building but that isn't the focus of the game and it has more legs than that, whereas the weak nature of the deck building wouldn't bother someone who isn't that into the mechanism.

If this ever goes on sale for $18 like it did one time I might still get it though to try it out solo.

EDIT: So I did end up getting this game. For someone who isn't good at memorizing cards the game felt like it had more of tactical feel than a strategic ones, as the cards you buy go to the top for your next game and also I only remember far enough of the distribution of my opponent's deck of cyborgs vs. naturals, etc. to counteract what they are buying next round (not that it isn't strategic, it's just there seems to be such a heavy discount rate of when you'll see cards again from a strategic standpoint that it is hard to scope out). I was also happy to find out that the different teams are in fact slightly different, though they still have 85% of the same feel when playing them. I did some statistical breakdown and on paper based on what I value (which might not be accurate) it seems like New York is slightly stronger than the other ones but not by much. It appears NY is good at batting and picking off players, LA is the only team that can steal bases, SF isn't good at batting but is generally solid in most other things, and BOS have a hard time getting on a base but drive the ball far.

If you are unfamiliar with baseball there are some mechanisms that are poorly explained or are unintuitive, for example base runners meaning only the people already on base and not the batter (so a fast batter does not advance one more than he/she hit, and you can't pick off a batter), I don't think walks are ever explained, and whether the batter for clutch takes away a batter from the hit box or not.

Picked up May 2015 with all 5 current expansions.

Play this with my son who really likes baseball. The mechanics are really simple but there are lots of tough choices. Quite a substantial number of cards available to draft into your team, especially with the expansions, so the variability is great. Plus you have to adapt somewhat to how your opponent is developing his/her team at the time. I like how the 4 base teams you get aren't quite the same. Looking forward to a few new base team sets. Solid game.

Ordered it from CSI the moment it is available, as there are no other online shops selling this game. Superb components but very pricey. Over 60USD with all the expansions, and those expansions, if added together, is just less than 100 cards!
Gameplay-wise, I would say this is my most preferred sports game. Game flows smoothly with a strong sense of baseball theme inside. BTW where is my favourite Toronto Bluejays?
Edited on 10/10/2015: This has become my default 'go-to' game in case I have no idea what I want to play in the coming gaming session. Very scalable for 2/4 players (never tried 3), relative short gametime (once both players know the rules, it rarely drags over 45 mins) yet very rewarding gameplay, makes this ideal to start a gameday or waiting for other players for more complex games.
However some players who don't watch baseball do find some difficulty in learning the rules.
Rating up to 9 (1 point deducted for the price), but 8 for non baseball players.

This game is great.  It's a deck builder that plays a whole baseball game, focusing only on the highlights, in just a few minutes.  Then, you take the cards you played during the game to purchase new players for the next game.  It's like fantasy baseball and an episode of SportsCenter all wrapped up into a heads-up card game.  

It's only good two or four players.  There is a three player variant but it just feels unnatural, like a two-headed baby.  Nobody wants to play with a two-headed baby.  It's confusing.  So don't play this game 3 players.

theme actually works better than I thought it would.
Rules and board representations took a minute to feel right.
The idea that your playing the games highlights makes sense when you see it.
Art is nice.
The deck rebuilding felt a little cumbersome and the amount of random for this type of game I'm not a huge fan of.  The randomness isn't high at all its just higher than what I figured.  I think its the fact I would have thought there would be more sharing of rosters up front more or something like that.

So clever and really thematic.  It makes perfect sense to buy new players and send old ones to the minor leagues, which is then all rolled up in the deck building of the game.  

For some reason, I've always been interested in the sports/team management side of games.  This hits all the right notes.  You have to manage the players on your team and the best time to play them during the game.  You have to watch how your opponent is building their team and try to build yours up while trying to counter their strategy.

Love that each card played represents an inning in the game instead of having to deal with each individual play of the game.  Manages to capture the exciting aspects of baseball and fits the theme perfectly.

This feels like a game I will never get to play enough of and I'm not even a baseball fan.  Just so satisfying to play, even if you don't win.

one of my favorite deck builders. unlike other deck builders where you count your money and buy the most expensive from the available cards and rinse and repeat. each turn in BH2045 is very tactical. if you do not play intelligently, you lose. very gripping game play and you can really build a theme for your deck. you can choose to build a very defensive team or a power hitting team or a fast team etc. its all up to you.

I don't like baseball, my girlfriend doesn't like baseball, baseball highlights 2045 is now one of our favorite couples games. I like deckbuilding as a mechanic, but I think I prefer it used as a part in a bigger picture rather than the entire scope of the game. Baseball highlights works like that, its played as a series of minigames (hands) and after each one you will be given the chance to improve your deck. during each minigame you will play all your cards one at a time, in turn order. Most cards have an effect and a number of possible hits that player can score, the effect usually involves canceling certain types of hits, or moving your runners closer to the home plate. after each player has played their entire hand the winner of that minigame is determined and players can buy new cards to add to their decks. although I'm a baseball laymen, even I can see the theme pretty strongly in this one, its a fairly tense and swingy back and fourth with a lot of room for spectacular plays. I'll be keeping an eye out for more games from mike fitzgerald form now on.

I think if you like the drama of sports - doesn't have to be baseball, although it helps - at all, you have the potential to like this game.  It may seem simple, but the back-and-forth cardplay is really, really satisfying; pitching a shutout feels great compared to trading huge combos in games like Star Realms or Dominion.  But if you don't like that, there are probably better deckbuilders.  I don't like deckbuilding in general but I love this game.

[microbadge=1714]

10-Sep-2016:  This is a deckbuilding game with a futuristic baseball theme.  You play a series of mini-games representing a World Series.  Each mini-game lasts only six rounds (plus extra innings if needed) with one card being played per inning.  It's a quick back-and-forth between two opponents that has a great rhythm to it once the gameplay clicks in your brain.

It can definitely be a bit fiddly with the movement of the runners on the board, but that also adds to the theme and presentation.  For the solo game, you basically just draw a random set of 15 "good" cards and play them randomly for the AI player.  It works pretty well, actually.  But most Series go the same way with the AI being very strong early and the Player playing catch up.

There are a couple of variants that try to even out the randomness of the AI deck that I like to use and seem to work farily well. I've added in all the expansions I own (less the Coaches), but I'm starting to feel like they dilute the deck too much for a random AI opponent.  I might take them back out.

Also, I actually got to play this a few times against human opponents this year and yep, fantastic 2P game.  No surprise there.

Best w/2:

Overall I am happy with this game.  Component wise the cards have a nice feel and are good quality.  I wish the base runner pawns were meeples but no biggee (I can cheaply replace).  The rule book is ok, but assumes you know the rules of baseball (the game play thematically to them).  It took me a couple of plays and online searches to begin playing correctly.  Solo play is good - with the AI winning more than I would like at this point.  I am still learning though.  2 player and 4 player are very fun - games go fast with lots of back and forth.

(iOS version) Can't comment on 3 or 4 player.  Quite a fun little deckbuilder.  A few quirky rules when you first play, but after you get them down, the gameplay really comes together to be a quick, nicely strategic AND tactical version of baseball.  Solo play is challenging as well. Would love to play 4 players!

AMAZING GAME!!!
I don't think there was a single thing I didn't like about it...

Fluid and simple game play, interesting way to build your team up and trying to also counter the team your opponent is building

The sense of building your team up from scratch is great... and be carefully watching the players your opponent is buying so you can better react to what he might do and to what players you should be buying to counter that is very well designed...

Even if you don't like Baseball you should give this a try... it's an awesome awesome game!

I really like this game, but some recent plays have me rethinking if this game can be broken. I played against someone who got nothing but "cancel hit" cards, and they won by a landslide. Fairly unique for a deck builder though. I just don't know that there is much variation from game to game.

I am a stickler for some authenticity in sports games based on real sports, so a futuristic baseball game wasn't exactly jumping out at me, even though it had deck building included (which I really enjoy).  Thanks to a recent sale on the app version of the game, I finally tried it and found the game to be very enjoyable, even if the theme doesn't mesh well with my inherent bias.  The game plays quick, escalates well, and creates some tense moments.  This will be staying in my collection.

Brilliant deck building game. Thematic, but not so much so that you need to be a baseball buff.

Played a multiple-set tournament only one so far but it was absolutely superb and really sets this ahead of other deckbuilders, given that it combines a developing CCG-esque "meta" with the fast gameplay of 2-player match-ups.

Baseball Highlights grew on me, at first I was just so-so on the game, but the more I played it the more I feel this could be on my top ten. As a baseball fan (go Cubs and Royals) playing Baseball Highlights, I can really see the game playing out on the board. As a board game fan I like the strategy Baseball Highlights invoke. If I have a player that can hit a home run I might play try to hit a triple so the other player will play his "strike" a player our" card. Then I follow up with the home-run. Baseball Highlights is must buy for any baseball fan, and a must play for everyone else.

As a brit that LOVES LOVES LOVES baseball this is about as close as I will ever get to being able to actually play it with other people. Heck, this is about as close as I will get to even being able to talk about it with other people. Such a fun and clever blend of deck building and card play - plays quick, requires multiple levels of tactical thought as well as strategic thinking in card buys etc. I can see this one hitting the table often (if only as a solo play for a quick fix). Mike Fitzgerald is a genius - no-one that makes card games comes close in my view - even when the game is not a rummy variant he still hits a home run every time.

[i]Quick update - this game has recently grabbed my attention, a friend of mine owns it so hopefully I'll get it played again soon.

Thank you Ralph for teaching/playing the game with me. I played a prototype version of this game and had fun. Another take on deck building with a baseball theme. The game play was quick and I really liked how you could recruit new players onto your team between each match.

While I thought the game was fun I am probably not the intended audience for a few reasons. The first being my general dislike for deck builders, I think they are fun at first but I very quickly burn out on them. Second the baseball theme does nothing for me, especially with the robot/cyborg element they threw in.[/i]

This one goes to Eleven!!

What an incredibly designed opus! This IS Baseball! So unique and fantastic is the gameplay and the artwork. I'm stunned. The mechanisms fit the theme wonderfully. A pleasant surprise. A genuine pleasure. And I'm not even a certified baseball fan. An excellent blend of a tactics and strategy in slow-building deck builder for 2 players. 

If anyone just plays a couple mini-games for the first time, they need to play more in order to see how this game comes alive.

You don't need to love baseball to love this, BUT because it is about baseball, this probably is not for everyone. Also, I believe this is a somewhat heavier than a Gateway level game.

Okay: I learned that we've been playing Clutch, Quick Eye, and Leadoff incorrectly. Those Immediate Actions are much more powerful. Supercool!

The rules are very difficult to pick up for such a  simple game and made this much less fun to get the hang of that could have been. And finding explanations for what some of the cards to can be difficult. 
But - underneath it all is a cool game. I love buying new players and then seeing what they can do. 
PS - I don't have much of an idea about actual baseball so that may have made learning this even more difficult!

RATING: 10
Certainly the most unusual baseball game I've ever played. The charm in this one is the balancing. It's impossible to play, solo or with others, without having at least a few incredibly close, exciting games. I was tempted to take a point off for this or that little detail, but it all gets countered by the balancing. This game is never boring. 

While coding and testing the official app of this game, I've played it a few hundred times this year, and it's still a lot of fun for me.

RATING: 5
Decent "slow" deck builder with a really good theme.  Most of the mechanics and card text feel very connected to the theme.  However, I am just not as enamored with the gameplay as most people seem to be.  It feels a bit clunky and it tends to last a little longer than it should.  Even with the "express" game in which you simply do three initial buy phases followed by a world series, the game starts to feel a tad repetitive and starts to drag. The card play is very blah IMO. You draw six cards blindly plus an optional seventh for the on deck to use as a pinch hitter. So on a given play, you basically pick one of six cards to play and it is usually very obvious which is the correct choice. I also do not like the opponent finishing their turn halfway through your turn. I see why it was done that way, but I found it clunky and mistake prone. Other than that, the six card mini games almost felt like they were auto played. The real decision making was in the phase where you purchase free agents using the cards you just used in the mini game. Those buy phases are extremely short lived and then the game shifts immediately back to another boring mini game.

Maybe it is just me, but I really do not see the validity in the hype around this game at all.

What a fun and clever idea for a game! The basic concepts of baseball are all there, so it's easy enough to teach to anyone whose ever held a baseball bat. Quite honestly, even if you haven't, it's pretty straight-forward. 

The hand management and deck building aspects are just tricky enough to ensure lots of replayability.

RATING: 9
Baseball set in the near future. They fixed it from being boring by adding robots and cyborgs as well as shortening the game. Each player picks a starting team that varies from one another slightly. As you play a game, you go back and forth trading hits and running bases. Once a mini game is over, you draft cards from the players that you used to play the previous game. The nice thing is, your deck is only 15 cards and must be 15 cards, so it becomes better and better. Eventually it all culminates into the world series.

The game is tense, exciting, has plenty of strategy and would be excellent in tournament format. I'm starting to appreciate it more and more each time I play it. The expansions just add more to the game to keep it fresh and interesting. Outside of the first 8 (?) teams, you're really only buying names for the others as they are repeats of the previous 8.

Additional Content: Teams 14-24, Expansion 1-7

Need: Teams 5-13, going to keep an eye on them and see if they drop in price. I'd rather not spend $6 a team. I was able to the rest of the teams for $2.50 which is crazy cheap and probably a much better price. I can see a 5 bucks on their own, but a bundle should be much cheaper.

Abstracted baseball game that plays an entire 7-game series in a single session.

There are other fun baseball card games where you alternate card play. BH2045 goes a step further by incorporating deck building thru free agent cards, thus expanding outcomes and boosting replay value.

A nice amount of strategy in every game (your 6-card hand) where you can really hamstring yourself if you play your hand wrong. This back and forth for at least 4 games (sweeping a 7-game series) makes for A LOT of tense and exciting moments packed into an hour.

Both 7-game series I've played have resulted in going the distance, one in which I robbed my opponent of a home run on the visitor save action. The other series, I clawed back from an 0-2 deficit to force Game 7 and ultimately losing. 

Both times I've played the solo-variant, I lost resoundingly 4-1 (2+6 buy rounds), 4-0 (3+6 buy rounds). The AI is tough to beat with so many fast(red) runners.

This might sound masochistic, but one of the things that I like about BH2045 is what happens when you run out of defensive cards. You just have to bear the brunt of your opponent's offense, just like in real baseball when the wheels fall off and the other team rallies against you. It happens and it makes it more realistic.

I have the Kickstarter version.

STAG Game of the Year 2015. Despite the theme (not immediately appealing to a non-US audience), pretty much everyone who plays this elegant deck-builder goes on to buy a copy of their own. I have an excessive number of teams and all the expansions, but these are by no means essential: the game works well enough out of the basic game box. Only disappointment is the use of Colditz-style pawns to represent the batters and base runners. The search is on for the most suitable substitutes (preferably distinguishing natural, cyborg and robot, as well as slow, average and fast). I am currently using a team of Lego baseball players.

(1 play)  I played one best 3 of 5 game just to get an introduction to the mechanics.  I really enjoyed the quick pace and the feel of baseball.  A friend ran a tournament recently that I didn't play, but watched.  They did a 10 game regular season with drafting, then the 8 players did a single elimination best of 7 tournament to get a winner.  It looked like a blast!  I'd like to play this one more.

Just great fun. Not quite as quick as the box touts (what is!?), but preliminary rounds can be reduced to Buys if time is tight.

Wow, I haven’t been this instantly smitten by a game for a while. I love the way it abstracts almost all the details of baseball away but still captures the feel of the game so well. The basic idea is that you play a series of five-minute mini-games with 6 players drawn from your deck, but after each game you get to upgrade one or two of your basic cards to more powerful ones. The slow but steady increase in strength gives the game a wonderful arc as well as an array of possible strategies and constant reassessment of your own deck against your opponent’s. Impressively, six card plays each can result in vastly different games, from pitching battles decided by the odd run to 10-9 slugfests.

Playing two-player is a very interesting and satisfying head to head challenge. Your cards represent your team's offense and your team's defense all on one card. You play six cards per game, each card represents an inning.  Games score like baseball does, and what you are really trying to do is take 4 of 7 games in a series format.  Card play is really satisfying and the choices are meaningful to your success, and impactful for deterring your opponent.  And the cards are pretty balanced to how much an individual card can change the game (ie, they ones that really help your score are not so effective on defending, good defending doesn't score much, and you have middle of the road cards between those extremes).

So, I know nothing about baseball, but this game makes me think I like it. The multi-use cards are great, switching between offensive and defensive play at a moments notice. Knowing how to line up base runners seems to be the key, though you never quite know what your opponent has waiting for you, and that home run you've saved up might just go to waste and leave all of your runners un-scored.

There is a fair amount of luck involved, and
perhaps not a lot of depth, but there is some interesting tactical play. A full match barely takes 15 minutes, and is followed up by my favorite part of the game- buying new teammates, which includes of all kinds of interesting cyborgs and humans with special powers.

This is a great game that gives a nice baseball flavor.  I love deck builders, so no surprise I like the mechanics.  The art is fun, the rules work well, and it feels enough like baseball for me to enjoy it (but nonbaseball fans can enjoy it too.)

The back and forth gameplay is exciting.  The counter and return keeps the pace quick so the game doesn't bog down.  I almost wonder if you could use a version of this to make a good tennis themed game?

A futuristic baseball themed deck builder.... Man, who'd a thunk it?  Got to love modern boardgames ;)


Updated to a 10 - fantastic game that just refuses to get old for me.  My son and I used the expansions to draft teams and have set up a league.  The games are quick enough for us to play a nice sized season with 12 teams over a few weeks.

This game is a brilliant simulation of being a coach who's recruiting and managing players to outwit a recurring enemy team.

Gameplay-wise, it's somewhere between a very smart game of Top Trumps and a deckbuilding game. Plus it has a clever map system to handle running baseballers.

The two players take turns playing one baseballer card from their hand. The fiendish way the details on each card interact determines how well your baseballers move around the pitch (the map).

You need to consider the myriad ways your cards could interact with the ones the opponent has in their hand. It's about timing, judgement, intuition and memory.

The teams evolve differently every game, so it's very replayable. Buying new star players within each game is fun and cleverly handled, as you can intentionally develop your team to prioritise earning money if you want to.

I think it's a game anyone can play - even 10 year olds etc - although a serious player would probably beat them a lot.

That brings me on to my only reservation. This game could seem too random if you play it very casually. That happens because the strategy and fun is tied into you remembering (as best you can) your opponent's available baseballers and using that information to play strong counters at the right times. It's not a heavy amount of memorising but it does require your attention. Children in partcular, however, might be happy playing it quite randomly just because it's very thematic and evocative.

There are many other elements that make this really interesting:
- the strategies around the different speeds of runners circling the bases (i.e. trying not to jam-up fast baserunners behind slower ones).
- the subtleties of placing a player in reserve to have them in your 'back pocket' or even intentionally to take them out of this match so you'll carry them over into the next one (if, for example, you know the opponent will have a strong counter to them in this match) ... plus trying to guess what your opponent's one might be. You could even use it to dump an 'unpopular' player if you want to increase your takings from a match in order to get a better star player afterwards.
- the attempts to tempt the opponent into playing certain batters, pitchers and fielders at the wrong times.
- each baseballer card having so much personality, encapsulated by a clever, intuitive mishmash of different factors.
- purchasing one, two or even three star players after each game is great fun, especially as there are many dozens of different ones (more so, with the expansions). They make every game a unique challenge.
- the way each player has access to 15 cards overall but only 6 within each match (winner if first to win 4 matches) creates a clever dynamic of hand management and prediciton, especially as the 'on deck' mechanism allows some sneaky manipulation on it.
- the action begins immediately, without any tedious initial development process.
- sometimes you can have near-perfect information about your opponent's hand .... IF ONLY you could remember what cards they've already played! ;)
- the rare but classic moments when a poor baseballer with only one redeeming ability manages to capitalise on it completely, because you played them at the perfect moment.
- the fun way that many baseballers have the option of letting you temporarily discard them and replace them with a random team-mate, for when you need random fortune to help you!

It's also a great game for tournaments, especially as the box generously contains everything you need to run a pair of two-player games at the same time. It's interesting taking a team you've tailored against one particular enemy and having to adapt it against an entirely different team.

Note that the above is based on me including four of the five small expansions in the Deluxe set (using all but the 'Coaches' one), although I think the basic game would have been good too. I highly recommend getting the expansions, which are affordable. You don't need to buy any of the extra team expansions, though - they are cool but virtually cosmetic.

Own digitally and after about 20 games (vs AI and Standard Solo) I don't know that I ever want to play again. I love deck building but the game feels stilted and mechanical and the core gameplay just feels like an unnecessarily elaborate Rock-Paper-Scissors game. If I had to compare it to anything it would be the Gwent card game in the Witcher 3 video game. Which I also played a handful of times before deciding I never needed to again. Too bad, because I really wanted to like this but the much simpler Legendary won me over hands down compared to Baseball Highlights.

Update: Had a four person tournament this weekend. Two simultenous 2p games in a best of 7 series with 3 pre-game buy rounds, before each series. Then a regular buy round after each game, so that each winning player would have a fully decked out hand to use in the World Series. It was insane! Some of the best gaming we've ever had! Two of the gamers were baseball players, and they were as you can imagine, simply enthralled with this game. I'll say it now... This game when used for tournament style, is probably some of the best board gaming around. I am not exaggerating.

Update: I also own it on IOS and the app is pretty good. Just needs online play to take it to the next level. I am not the biggest fan of pass and play.

Mike Fitzgerald's magnum opus, this is a well-themed introduction to deck-building, when you get to "buy" free agents after each (quick) baseball game and send your less desirable players to the minors.  The play is intuitive despite a wonky and disorganized rulebook.  The cards are clever riffs on baseball greats.  The expansions are not necessary but can add some cool twists.  The base game box is amply sized and will hold as many expansions as you like.

I've only played the app version of this, but have everything for the physical game.  It's excellent.  Simple rules and it is easy to learn, but with lots of depth and the free agents are so varied that even if you just have the base starter teams, the games are going to be different every time.  Great stuff!

[1 play] I am intrigued. I thought the theme might be silly to the degree of being off-putting. But no, it still feels like a solid baseball theme and plays very well. An interesting twist on a deck builder. I can't wait to try it some more on a nice long relaxed campaign play.

I feel like I have to lower this game just for the lack it's been played, I loved it when I did though. Since I started logging plays in APRIL of 2017, as of writing this in JULY 2017, it has not been played once. Two player games obviously aren't going to get played as much but this game is good enough that it deserves more. I am horrible at it though, haven't won yet, but it's an extremely fun minigame and deckbuilder. The only sports themed game I really have any desire to have or play.

I like baseball, and this really emulates the feel of baseball highlights. I love the glove to knock away a hit as the Visitor Save option at the end of the game; you can almost picture the fielder leaping over the wall to steal the home run and win the game. Each mini-game is a quick, fun hand of cardplay, and the deckbuilding aspect adds a nice metagame element to top it all off.

I played baseball as a kid.  I watched the Blue Jays win the World Series in 1992 and 1993.  I followed them until the labour relations unrest of the 1990s killed my interest, but I still played.  I still loved the game itself.  So I was disposed to like this game before I played.  

The most remarkable thing about Baseball Highlights is how successfully it abstracts away all of the boredom involved with watching baseball while capturing the spirit of the game.  Knowledge of baseball may not be necessary, but it's definitely an asset.  It certainly makes learning the rules easier.

It might be objected that there's a lot of luck in the game.  Close games depend on key cards coming at the right time.  But isn't that true of many games?  And playoff sports in general?  Randomness heightens the tension and excitement, doesn't it?  For the right audience, the game is just about perfect.

RATING: N/A
1 play, 1 game only, 2-player

It's a neat system, simulating an entire season of baseball where you can recruit new players, play multiple (abstracted) games, and finally end with a World Series 7-game match. Each game consists of back-and-forth card play with a neat system where players alternate putting pressure on the other, possibly responding defensively if you can. Individual games are over pretty quickly, playing through 9 innings (but not overly detailed -- just the highlights, really). After each game, you earn some money with which you can buy new cards, discarding old ones -- quick and easy deck building! 

But I have ZERO interest in baseball so it was all lost on me. I enjoy Harry's Grand Slam Baseball, though, probably because it is VERY light and feels VERY random, just like baseball looks to me. You know, this team is up, then that team, sometimes people get on base .... Maybe if this comes out with a different theme, I'll be able to actually evaluate it.

RATING: 7
This is a two player baseball themed strategy game set in the future where players are either robots, cyborgs, or "naturals" (boring 'ol humans).  Each player will take turns playing one card from their hands.  Each card has a number of runners and their speed (average speed runners will run an extra base if on 2nd or 3rd and fast speed runners always run an extra base) and possibly an ability such as canceling out an opponents hit played that round or picking off a base runner.  Players go back and forth playing a single card trying to cancel or mitigate the card their opponent played while also trying to get their own runs.  This is played in a World Series format where the best of 7 games wins.

In between games in the series you will be able to replace cards with more powerful upgraded ones.  Each card you played during the previous game also has a certain amount of upgrade points that you can use to purchase these for the next game.

I'm not a big baseball fan so the theme doesn't really grab me.  This is futuristic baseball with robots and cyborgs but the abilities still boil down to just hits and picks.  That being said, the gameplay itself is very fun and strategic.  I like the back-and-forth of trying to respond to your opponents cards, get your own players to score, and saving other cards for the right time.  And I really like the deck-building/upgrading aspect of it between rounds.  Also, the art is pretty good.

The gameplay can certainly feel slow with the back and forth single card play nature of it (just like real baseball!).  And sometimes decisions aren't too deep or difficult as you only have 6 cards to choose from each round and often the best option is obvious.

Only played solitaire. However love the simplicity and beauty of 6 cards per match, a purchase bang do it again. Brian Bankler remarked on its similarity to Japanese minimalist games and that is spot on.

Own the Deluxe edition.

----------------------------

Now played a few 2 player games. Amazing micro deck builder. Only downside is that enjoyment enhanced if you have a little baseball knowledge and interest. The game feels like baseball, but without any of the boring bits (its genius to be eliminate strikes but have the feel of them).

And its now a 9 after 20 plays. Every play I like it more.

UPDATE: My copy has come in, and it is awesome. The only thing that might keep this as a tick away from a 10 is that it is mostly a 2 player game. I might update it to a 10 anyway, it is so good. Most mini-games come into a run or two apart at the final score. I really like baseball, I love this game.

Played at Origins once. Can't wait to get a copy of this.  I wish that I would have pledged in the Kickstarter. Awesome game. Really want to explore this more.

- If you know baseball, it's really easy to pick
- Good solo game, but somewhat a little easy
- Futurist theme was a risk but it works as it's not overplayed
- Fast game means you can play  Word Series every time
- Drafting players make for interesting customizing of teams
- Cards and boards quality

:thumbsdown: DISLIKE
- Graphic design is a letdown, everything is a bit mucky and hard to read. Plus it doesn't fit the futurist theme
- Player pawns
- Once your deck is built, games can feel samey

Still can't get my head around how I can feel like playing baseball with only playing 6 cards to simulate. A great abstraction of baseball; well implemented.

RATING: 6
Enjoyable quasi-deckbuilder themed around futuristic baseball. Players take turns playing cards representing their baseball team, each one featuring a player with a money value, a special ability and a number of "hits" (single/double/triple/home run). Hits lag by a turn, so the opponent has a chance to cancel them before pawns run the necessary distance around the little baseball diamond. 

Cards can be traded in between games, up to the money value of cards used that game, which is where the deck building (and thinning) comes into it. The SF theme matters only in that some cards have special effects only against robots, cyborgs or "naturals", e,g, cancelling all hits or stealing bases, so it is possible to purchase cards specifically to exploit an opponent's vulnerability.

It's a very good, light-ish 2p game (more players require a sort of clumsy league system) that I would enthusiastically recommend over titles targeting that niche, such as Star Realms. The tactility of moving runners around the player boards helps bring the theme alive, there's plenty of room for strategic play and the small decks/repeated small games add some lovely interactive bluffing/player reading.

I don't think the expansions hurt but I'm also not convinced that they're needed. It feels to me like a very small game expanded, unnecessarily, into a large box.

I'll start saying that I'm not a baseball fan, however since I live in a country dominated by baseball fanatics, I made a leap of faith and obtained this game to play it with my family (who are not too much into boardgames). Afyer playing fornseveral times I can say this game is awesome, due its smooth and simple mechanics and you'll also feel the theme. One of the most amazing things about this game is that the each game feels differently and the score is always tight which gives the sensation of competitiveness along the game and push the players to manage its resources at its best. The free agency mechanic make your team strong and also trying to explode your opponent's team weaknesses. The
Complexity is low-medium, in my experience I explained the game in 5 to 10 minutes, played three mini-games and that is all required to the other player to be grasped by this wonderful game. Time of play is regularly 30 to 45 minutes. In summary great game, even if you are not in the real sport, this boardgame will catch your attention on the blink of an eye.

RATING: 6.5
Interesting game.  For every thing I liked, I felt there was something else holding it back.  I like the idea of the theme, but I wasn't big on the art.  I like the core gameplay for the most part, but I feel like with 6 cards, your options may just be too constrained.  Specialized cards feel like they could be amazing, but like in a lot of CCG's and deckbuilders, it is pretty hard to tech against your opponent with so few cards in your hand.  The deckbuilding could be really good, but it is really slow.  You get to buy very few cards from a small display.  It's also really straightforward, deckbuilding-wise, and I feel like it doesn't have to be.

All that being said, I did have some fun with this, and I like the way the games flow.  

A side note: when doing a round robin with 4 people, you really, really want to tie and go into extra innings, because it pays to do so.  That is incredibly stupid.  We didn't actually get to do it, but I can imagine a situation where none of my opponents games went to extra innings, but in mine we went in all 3 games.  My deck would be MUCH better than theirs, and where is the fun in that?  It isn't even a thematic choice.

I enjoyed it.  Had some really good quality and did a fine job of incorporating theme into a 'deck building' and hand management game.  Is a bit fiddly at the beginning since you're both countering your opponent and playing your next move simultaneously with one card, but by your second game that's easy to overcome, no big deal.  Would play again, but think it would work the best as a regular group that meets and develops teams over a long period of time.

Very clever simulation of baseball, distilled into a quick playing card game. The game works very well, with mini games to play out the innings of a baseball, and deck upgrades in between (so the equivalent of trades / free agent signings). A lot of strategy packed into the game and provides excitement and entertainment, packaged up in an excellent competitive deck builder - which should appeal to fans and non-baseball fans alike.

So far I'm really liking this game.  I liked it at first even when being taught and playing the game kind of wrong on several points.  Once I read the rules myself and clarified some of the timings, everything seemed to work much better.  There are some weird timing things that can kind of throw you off, but if you're diligent about playing in the right order, everything works out.

This game somehow does it all.
Variable play time from 5mins to day long tournaments. Great with 1, 2, and 3 players (plus tournaments for additional players). Mind games abound in both play and drafting. Very strong theme.

Terrible production leading to different size cards/editions, and a refusal to update, is extremely disappointing.

RATING: 9
   I've gotta say, this game really surprised the heck outta me. I read the reviews about it, but just couldn't see what seemed to be so good about it. In fact, there were a couple of thigs that bothered me right away.

  It didn't seem to have any depth, the play looked scripted, and I wasn't a fan of the player sketches or coloring. And playing six cards was the whole game? I wrote it off as being to short ot be of much interest.

  Now that I've played it...I was completely wrong about this game, it's a real blast to play. Lots and lots of fun, and I'm not a a big baseball fan btw.

  I've only played the game a few times (3), but I've found that there's surprising amount of depth to the game. And the game play is not scripted. You choosed what cards to play, and when. Do you go for Offense, or Defense? Pitching, or some combination of all three? Do you play for the Big Inning, keeping the score low? Speed on the base paths? Or wiping his runners off the base paths? There is a lot to try and accomplish here, and it makes for a really fun game.

  And even though you're only playing six cards in a mini-game, there is just enough decision making that it feels like you're making meaningful choices. It really does feel like you're watching a team that you put together play an actual game of baseball (in 2045 of course!).

  I love the drafting of free agents, how you can tailor your team.

  And now that I've actaully played the game, I have to applaud the choices that were made. I really like the old style player uniforms now, and the sepia tone to the player pictures. It's very evocotive of the Black Sox era (except for the bionic arms and robot hitters of course).

  The AI for playing solitaire is exceptional. I don't know how many times I've been leading, or had runners in scoring position, and the AI draws a doulbe play, or a home run at the end of the game. Some games I turn over the AI's card and go "I can't believe it." It's that well done.

  Like I said, I'm not a huge baseball fan, but you don't have to be to enjoy this game.

  I am so glad that I took a chance on this game. Try it, you'll like it.

I picked this up on a whim because it was 50% off, and so far I'm glad I made the purchase.  I'm a pretty big sports fan, but had yet to find a sports game I really liked.  [thing=95105][/thing] is a decent football game, but felt a bit too rock-paper-scissors for me.  [thing=151022][/thing] manages to deliver a relatively light and streamlined game that captures the feel of baseball very nicely.

A session takes place over several games - usually best of 7 - which feels appropriate for baseball since the season is so long.  Each game is six innings and is simplified to one card/player per inning.  Each player/card/inning has the potential to get zero to three hits, but the hits don't occur until after your opponent plays their next card.  So, you always have one chance to make a defensive play or use a good pitcher to negate the hits.  The games each take ~5 minutes once you know what you're doing.  

After each game, you can purchase all-star players to replace your beginning deck of no-name rookies and veterans.  Players generate different amounts of revenue that you can spend.  There can be a lot of strategy here where you try to counter your opponents team.  Maybe they bought a lot of robots (did I mention there are robots?  It's 2045 after all), so you might buy pitchers that can strike out robots.  In the expansions, there are cards that give you teamwork bonuses if you have played enough naturals (humans), so you could try to make a team of all naturals.  Or if it's early, maybe you want to grab the guy that generates a lot of revenue.  It's the typical deck building decisions that you would get from Dominion or the ilk, but a nice addition on top of the baseball theme.

So far I'm really enjoying it.  I haven't tried solo yet, but I know a lot of people like that.  There is also a 4 player variant where you do a round robin tournament with 3 games against each player.  In addition to the various "more cards" expansions, you can also buy more starter teams.  The base game comes with San Fancisco, New York, Boston, and LA, but almost every team is represented.  I might have to pick up Chicago and Seattle so I can play my favorite teams.

This ultra-quick, card-driven game does a great job on many levels. Players must balance their choices between the tactical considerations of winning a particular game versus the strategic decisions of building a strong team in the long run. Players also must watch how their opponent builds his team and adjust to that. But the real selling point here is that the card play is quick, interesting and fun. There are some nice layers of depth that aren't always found in a fun, light game.

I was a kid who, when I got home from school, ran inside, grabbed the sports section and spent the first bit of my post-school day reading box scores to the previous day's baseball games.  I listened to most Cardinal games--even West Coast games--on a little transistor radio that I kept beneath my pillow.  

I didn't know I needed this game my whole life.  But I did, and I couldn't be more happy about it.  I consider myself a baseball progressive traditionalist, I love the history of the game, I love the statistics, and I consider it by far and away the best sports game in the world.

So you can take my comments and my feelings about BBH 2045 with a grain of salt.  But for me, it is one of the most enjoyable games I have ever played.

RATING: 8
Solid 8 after 9 solo plays. I can't wait for a breathing opponent. It will likely go up.

First off, I love baseball. However, that does not make baseball games an automatic like for me. In fact, it is just the opposite. The only other baseball game I own is Harry's Grand Slam Baseball. I am very particular because I want the game to be true the the feel, but do not want to get bogged down in the minutia (computer games are much better for that).

BH gets the feel just right and does it in a remarkably quick playtime. But it is not just it's fidelity to baseball that makes it fun. 

The Dominion-like deck construction and speedy play make this more than a baseball game. Non-baseball fans can still really enjoy it. That said, I also think the theme is just perfect for the game. Being a baseball fan only enhances the experience. The futuristic setting keep the special powers from seeming ridiculous. Plus it keeps one from getting to caught up in worrying about realism.

This one is a deck-builder, but does not focus solely on engine building or overturning the deck quickly, but also on bluff or counter think. All in a series of bite size mini games. It is a truly unique take on deck-building games. It share more with Arctic Scavengers than Dominion

Update: I just played 3 head-to-head games. The quick gameplay and the team-building make this one very addictive. You want to keep trying something new. 

Another thing that I think is too easily overlooked in boardgames is the setup/takedown time. It is so fast to get this one going and to replay that it makes it that much more addictive.

I want to up my rating from an 8 to a 9, but I'll hold back until I get a few more two-player plays.




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 2
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 3
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 3
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 3


Overall - 3

The simple, abstract baseball gameplay is fantastic, and the concept of building up a team over a season or series (or whatever) is fulfilling. I can't help but feel like the sci-fi elements of the theme were largely unnecessary, though. I never feel like I'm managing robots or cyborgs, just a team of players.

It really goes under the radar, but, as a huge Star Realms fan, I found Baseball Highlights: 2045 to be an awesome and original PVP deckbuilder. If you don't like Baseball, don't worry you will still like the game. If you like baseball, then I don't even know why you don't own it already :P.
Plus, it has one of the most amazing solo mod (20 ish in the bgg solo ranking).

tom loved.  also:

Baseball Highlights 2045 on the other hand is EXXXXXXCELLENT. Great card game, whether you care about baseball or not. I do not. But the competition, the drama, the team-building, etc. transcend all of that. It is actually a cool setting though, sort of an old-timey baseball thing with robots and cyborgs. The deckbuilding is tight (and appropriate to the setting), the cardplay is exciting and simple. I've played with two and really loved the back-and-forth, and the solo game is just as fun even though it lacks the psychological elements of bluffing and trash-talk that puts it into the top tier. The only issue is that the rules are awkward. The entire process is like a half a page. The FAQ is ten pages. There's always some corner case, timing issue or confusing situation that sends you back to the phone to look at the document. It smooths out- especially the weird IGO (u kind of go) UGO (I kind of go) structure.

An extraordinary amount of fun to play, a surprise success in using the deck building system to simulate a baseball campaign. Despite the theming of the robots, etc, it somehow works and adds another axis for the designer to use.

Always fun, always close, and like in baseball, some crazy things can happen.

does work with 3 but not as well as with 2.  delivers exactly what it describes, a highlight reel of baseball with the full implementation of the quirky theme.  Yes, let's buy into a future where bionic arms lead to robotic hitters and a lasting niche for speedy humans on defense.

Surprisingly enjoyable and easy to get into sort of Deck Builder.  I enjoy the quick bouts of hand management and trying to read your opponent that this game offers.  The deck building is minor but enjoyable.  Baseball isn't an immediately appealing theme for me, but I found it really charming here.

Fun, fast playing simulation of a simplified game of baseball.  Decent deck-building, combined with very good match play really make this stand out from the crowd.  This game thankfully gets away from the traditional downfall of sport simulation games and doesn't decide that it needs to simulate every at bat or even every inning.  Instead, it uses simple back-and-forth cardplay to score hitting, running, fielding, pitching, and everything else.  The result is a tight game that feels like baseball, but playable much more quickly.  Definitely recommended for sports buffs who are looking for playability over simulation.

This game has gotten better and better every time I've played it.  I love the deck/roster building that happens throughout the game and the mix of strategy vs. tactics is awfully hard to beat...and it all happens in less than an hour!  There can create great moments of suspense with each minigame (of which you'll play up to 10 minigames over the course of 45 to 60 minutes), there is essentially no downtime, and I find there to be meaningful decisions on nearly every turn.

This game only really works with two people. But it's super, super fun and easy. Takes about an hour or two. You draft a team, get a random lineup from a small deck, and choose what order to play your cards in. A good deal of decision-making, strategy, and balance. I dunno how rewarding getting all of the expansions would be though.

Ok, hand management, take that, card game. 2-player game played as a league of matches for 4 players. Some clunky, presumably thematic, movement rules; and turns are a bit weird going back to finish half of your own turn halfway into your opponents turn. Would properly be better, and a buy for me, if adapted to a proper sport like football or handball.

I am in awe of this design. Distilling an inning of baseball down to a single card play should be either impossible or require a a ridiculous amount of charts and die rolling. Not so. Each card played resolves quickly, simply and clearly. And it's more exciting than you can imagine.

I don't love the robot theme, as the classes could be Lefty/Righty/Switch as easily as the silly robot hierarchy they used. I understand it though, as a straight MLB Theme would have been a turn-off to many boardgamers.

Still I can dream. Maybe someone will print a homebrew version with the real players...or this will make a big enough splash to transition into real players.

Great game, although the giant box is a little disappointing considering how little there is inside it. (Just a single, smallish deck of cards). Hopefully there are enough expansions planned to fill out the massive box.

This game is very exciting and keeps you thinking with each play. In my games, I have noticed they are close every time, and can come down to the last game in the best of five and even the last play of the game. While I love the 2 player, I am also very interested in playing a tournament style game. If you have any 2 player opportunities, thins needs to be in your collection!

Just realize that this isn't by any means a baseball simulation deck builder or even a true representation of the game but an fantasy stylized version that's meant to play fast and not outlast its welcome (like a full nine innings of baseball would do to me). Fast play and fun made it a winning combination for me. After 25 games I've increased my rating.  There's plenty to think about and tough card choices to be made.  Loving this game.  Upped my rating after even more play, and that's without the expansion decks, and no, I didn't kickstart this or even know about it until the day I bought it.

Micro deck builder card game as managers in a future baseball league fielding a team of rooks and vets of robots, cyborgs, and naturals. I like how the managers buy cards for their deck at the end of the game. Baseball is all about situations and cat and mouse. I wish the game did more to capture that in the card play.

RATING: 5
Having not played this game drafting prior to the first game I don't know how critical I can be, but upon repeat plays my initial affinity for this game has somewhat soured. The moment to moment decision making is fun but not always that exciting. Often decisions come down to did I draw a card that cancels this homerun or not. Granted this can be mitigated sometimes but other times you are destined to lose from the start. I don't want to criticize this game too harshly, as I said I genuinely liked it a lot at first but when the new game feel wears off I just think there are games with similar mechanics that I prefer because the overall game is better. I love baseball and this is the only baseball themed board game I have tried. Amazingly at times it can pull the theme off well but being thematic is not enough for me if the gameplay is somewhat stale.

Own the Super Deluxe, which might be a bit overpriced, but whatever.

Really enjoying this take on deck building. Theme is strong, mini-game is fun. Looking forward to playing more. Just got it though, so cult of the new and all that.

But as a huge fan of Wyatt Earp, I figured this would be pretty solid, and think it will remain so.

[rating assumes 5-8 player tournament play]

So far I've only participated in five-player round robin tournaments (2 rounds) with expansions galore and frequent breaks for steroid use - and future events are only bound to get bigger, not smaller. Good times, even with hot dog indigestion.

The game would undoubtedly be a hit with a dedicated group of baseball enthusiasts. Even so, designing a hardball simulation that non-sports fans like me can enjoy is a significant achievement.  I couldn't play every week, but I'd be happy to participate in an evening-length tourney every month or so.  That's a time investment with a solid return.

Minor confession: Our tourney finalists tend to be the players who luck into powerful, big-money cards during an early drafting round.  Coincidence?  Perhaps not.

Also, in our last session I had an extremely powerful build that went 6-2 during the regular season, and then nearly swept the series with a 4-1 win. My deck wasn't fun to play against, and spirits were somewhat low as a result.  I'm still optimistic, but I'd hate to see this pattern repeat itself.

I dunno. Perhaps some of the expansion cards are overpowered?  For tournaments, I almost wonder if the recruiting pool shouldn't be split into early- and late-game decks to keep the playing field a bit more even.

[i]Update:[/i]

To address the above issues, we've developed special tournament rules for 5-8 players to  keep the game balanced and fun. The rules are posted [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1538958/draft-rules-5-8-player-tournaments]here[/url].

Evokes the feel of a baseball game without being a simulation of a baseball game.  Quick cardplay.  Fairly light.  Simple drafting component that allows players to respond to each other's tactics.  Good for 2 or 4, but not 3.

I'm starting to cool on deckbuilding, but this one offers something more. Surprisingly, it does feel like I'm playing a game of baseball.

A quick, picky sidenote: the title of the game is awful. Just awful. It's like a bad 7th grade thesis sentence: "This paper is going to be about the galaxy." You get my point.

OK game, something about the baseball theme doesn't really resonate with me though. The presentation of the game makes it feel dated in way, perhaps it's trying to evoke nostalgia that I do not have the particular experience to feel.

This is going to become one of my favorite deck builders very quickly. I only wish the base game came with more cards. 4 starter teams and a 60-card free agent deck is not very substantial. I'm not inclined to spend a fortune on mini-expansions, either.

Super thematic game that stands on its own mechanics-wise but I do think being a baseball fan helps. The back and forth of the card play, and mini-games in a World Series, is really enjoyable and games do often come down to the wire. Over time it may become repetitive and feel too light for my tastes but right now it's a tense, fun super filler.

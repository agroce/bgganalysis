Since I don't know how to mark multiple versions, we actually have the Baby Cthulu, Faen, Foglio Muses, Pirate, and Professor Elemental decks.  We definitely picked up so many for the art.

There's honestly not much game here, but it's fantastic for a moment of brainless fun - at the end of a long day, while waiting for something, or as a refresher between games.  Plus the artwork is wonderful.

Although I'm sure it wouldn't bill itself as having a heck of a lot going on, I'll say: not a heck of a lot going on here.  I'd give it more whirls to see if I get more engaged, as it's easy enough to play.  Hard to see choosing this over "gamer's" fillers like Geschenkt or even King Lui, though.

Nice, fast, press your luck, fold or hit, play for the low points total or use the continuous version for a longer game. Great one to take out with you. Of course I had to get the barmaid version...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.6
Very much captures the feel of a traditional card game; plays swift and mindless and is not altogether devoid of interest due to the push-your-luck and judging probabilities factor. Lovely artwork on the Core Name of the Wind deck, too. Totally shoddy packaging, though, significantly too large for the actual deck of cards, in such a way that the box got severely damaged before the game even arrived at its owner.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Typically, I'm not a fan of push-your-luck mechanics. But this game is that mechanic... it doesn't mitigate any other decisions in the game. Furthermore, it plays incredibly quickly.

For what it is (filler), it create tension and doesn't overstay its welcome. Overall, I enjoy it.

I got several decks during their kickstarter and gave them to my college-age kids and their friends.  I've only played with 2 people and it's a fun, easy-to-pick-up timekiller, and I can imagine with more people it gets even more entertaining. Per the 21-year-old, they enjoyed it with up to the max a lot and it does get even more fun.

RATING: 10
An interesting game of partial knowledge and luck pushing. Figuring out when it's best to fold, and when it's best to hit. And laughing at others when they get it wrong.

The variants promise a lot of play out of the deck. 

The Continuous Play variant makes for a thinkier, and thus, for me, better game; with opportunities to mess with others, and making it so that crossing your fingers and saying hit every time is not a viable strategy.

However, the end game scores proposed in the rules should usually be higher (for instance, 21 for 4 players or 31 for 3).

Note, I no longer play the base game, I always choose to play Continuous Pairs over it.

Port, while fun in the early game and the midgame, has some scoring issues that make the end game rather dull for at least some and potentially all the players.

5 Cards is terrible. It's basically a variant of Lost Cities/Schotten Totten where you don't have a hand of cards. You merely draw and play.

Cons: Feels like it could have been a brilliant game with slightly different rules / deck distribution.

Plenty of good gaming in that Companion Book download. Still got lots more variants on tap to try out; we're getting lots of play out of the first ones we've tried.

Individual variant ratings:

Pairs: 3 - simplistic and stupid with 2-3 players

Continuous Pairs: 6 - adds some cool tactics, but not much beyond that.

Port: 3 - I've only played with 3 players, where it doesn't work at all. Looks promising with more.

Rocket: 6 - Plays like Blackjack, where each player plays against the house. Fun gambling game.

Regent: 6 - Haven't explored much, as I probably need to make a cheat sheet for all of the options.

Sweep: 9 - Cool twist on Lamarkian Poker.

Five Cards: 6 - A neat little 2-player game, but not in the same league as Knizia's best (Loco, Lost Cities, Battle Line, etc.)

This is about as close to not being a game as you can get whilst still being a game.   Barely.   Flip a card and hope it doesn't match one of your cards already.   Whee.

Pairs is an exceptionally simple game, playable by anyone over 7. But don’t let the simplicity put you off as the game is a wonderful experience to play. It’s a push-your-luck game, with the associated table banter which accompanies any game involving the make-or-break reveal of a card. 

The designers aimed to produce a game you can take to the pub and just play, with whoever you are with, gamer, granny, partner, kids, or whoever. And they have 100% succeeded in achieving what they aimed to. And this is no easy feat. Designing a good (ie interesting) simple game is as hard, if not harder, than designing a complex game. There are not that many good very simple games on the market. And they don’t come much simpler or much better than Pairs.

The packaging is in a wonderfully small card box, smaller than a pack of playing cards. This portability + the simple game play + you can play with up to 10 people + you can explain it in seconds + it has great interactivity + a game lasts 5 minutes + the excitement of the card reveal...all adds up to the perfect Pub game. And it is also the perfect family game, to be played at home or whilst waiting for the family food to arrive in the cafe.

Most impressive.

PS.Be sure to play the Continual Pairs variant.

Wow, I would ... not have anticipated this much nudity in a Cheapass Games product with absolutely no content warnings on it. And not chaste "Birth of Venus" nudity, either.

Now, me personally, I'm amused, but a lotta folks won't be. I'm not sure if it was a brave decision to preserve the integrity of the artist's vision or just an oversight.

The game itself is a pretty good timekiller, but you really have to be playing for money to make it worth having a dedicated deck for a game that's *basically* equivalent to something out of Hoyle.

So simple, so quick; a perfect little filler. This game is *so* quick, it almost doesn't count as a real game. But it's a lot of fun and the decisions can actually be fairly interesting. It describes itself as a "pub game," and I think it excels at hitting that target. Four stars is probably too generous for a game like this, but it is a good little game.

Most of my plays have been the variant Sweep. Pairs is an entertaining enough game but is definitely the pub game they declare it to be. Sweep offers some interesting decisions and makes it into more of a real game. Haven't tried any other variants yet but some of them sound cool.

Simple, but fun press-your-luck game.  Worked well with my large, and sometimes picky, gaming group right away.  Eventually tried the "Continuous Pairs" variant with the group, and I think that worked really, really well with so many players.  I would definitely recommend Continuous with a big group.  Everyone quickly slipped into minimize-the-damage mode by taking the lowest card before others did.

This game is like a billion times more fun than it has any right to be.  It has the perfect amount of card-counting  (read: tiny), with mildly sweaty risk-taking and steely-eyed one-upmanship.  And it's fast—[i]superfast[/i].  You don't tally plays of this thing, you mark [i]sessions[/i].  Upon first exposure we spent hours with this; hilarious, gregarious, table-knocking, good-time hours.  When we finally broke up for the night every couple flew off to buy their own copies.  Yeah, copies with an "s"—these decks are going to get [i]thrashed[/i].  And sleeving them misses the point entirely.

While you [i]could[/i] mock up your own copy or bash one together out of three standard decks of cards (or even repurpose that abandoned [thing=929]Dalmuti[/thing] deck, you know, the one knocking around in the bottom of the drawer with the '90s porno mags and the truss from your operation twelve years ago) why would you when you can play with a set like this

[imageid=2766786 small]
[size=7]Fig. 1 — [i]They say we did not evolve to eat cheese.  They are wrong.[/i][/size]

that appeals to both gentlemen [i]and[/i] ladies, as well as being suitable for children?  Do what you feel, man, but personally I'm overcome with the feeling that I want Mr. Ernest & co. to have my money...

...[i]and my baby.[/i]

PS.  [i]Progressive Pairs[/i] (a variant found in all rules sets) is totally the way to go.  Adds just a bit more game to the game with an extra layer of "screw you" choices.

2x Decks:  Goddesses of Cuisine and a kit-bashed Bicycle deck for camping.

The variety of art on different decks is nice.
The game itself is not so exciting to me--not many choices, and a lot of luck. Get an unlucky hit and you've pretty much lost the game, but are technically not eliminated, so you have to still sit through the game to its conclusion knowing there's no hope for you. Stick with Blackjack.

A new classic pub game indeed! It's a quick card game with an interesting deck, good for when you want about five minutes of light entertainment. Not much to it, but there doesn't need to be much to it. Press-your-luck style card game with a lot of dramatic turns of luck mitigated by a modicum of skill. Works especially well with the "continuous" variant.

I absolutely love this game!  It is such an easy to learn, fast paced game with a fairly small footprint.  I have taken this everywhere with me.  I've played it in bars, wineries, coffee shops, airports, and many other places.  It travels so well that I always have a copy with me to play.  Only downside is sometimes there comes a point where you know you will lose the game on your next turn so my wife and I made a house rule: if you can draw 5 cards without getting a pair, you automatically get 0 points!  It keeps everyone vested in the game and adds a bit more excitement.

Pairs is a very simple but refined game of chance.

Quick press-your-luck game. The deck is unbalanced, one 1, two 2s, three 3s, all the way up to ten 10s. On your turn, you can draw and risk pairing up, which scores you points based on the pair (points are bad). Or you can drop out and take guaranteed points which are presumably lower.

* Kickstarted — all 11 decks! *

Press your luck with this card game in which you can either take a card (taking a pair's value in points) or the lowest point value on the table -- but keep in mind it's the first person who reaches the threshold that loses. It's very quick, has 11 different sets of art, and has a number of variants in the rules to keep the game interesting as either a fast, fun starter or something to play for some quick gambling fun.

PLUS: speed of learning, speed of play, inexpensive, variations
MINUS: game ends in under ten minutes so don't expect to play this too long
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Super quick, super light, push your luck card drawing game. Go out early to take the lowest card on the table, or keep drawing. If you get a pair, you keep one card for points and deal them out again. If you are the first to get to a certain number of point before anyone else you lose. Everyone else wins. 

Something to do while drinking and chatting in a pub, to be sure. Something to do in the waiting room. Something to do at the bar-b-que. The game fulfills its intention perfectly. Quite non-gamer friendly.

The game is fine, I actually like it.  Wish BGG had a multi tiered system.  For a warm up game is is a 7.5.  However, I would never choose this over 90% of the games if I could pick anything I wanted to play.  Still, it is really good at what it set out to be, a nice pub game get drunk, hang out on the porch and chat type of game.

Apparently this is a pub game.  Nothing more than a press-your-luck game where you choose to hit and hope not to get a pair, or you take points from someone who already has a card.  The aim is to get no points or the fewest points.  Lather, rinse, repeat.  Yawn.

I didn't believe this actually works as a game but it did.

Pairs is the name of the game, and pairs of cards are what players want to avoid.

The game uses a 55-card deck that contains one 1, two 2s, three 3s, and so on up to ten 10s. At the start of the game, shuffle the deck, then remove five cards from play unseen. Deal one card face-up to each player.

RATING: 7.5
Regarded as a 'Pub Game' Pairs is a quick and easy game of card play where the players are asked to either take a card or earn bad points equal to the lowest card in play. 

What makes the game interesting is that the deck is made up of ten 10s, nine 9s, eight 8s all the way down to 1 ace. In this way the players can guage what their odds of survival are to a degree as the game unfolds. 

The reason why they call this a pub game is because it is easy to play with a drink and if your eye wanders to the footy or racing, it is easy to do both. It also promotes push-your-luck and is good for betting on who buys the next round. 

It is possible to create the deck by combining 3 decks of cards and taking out the cards that are not required. 

This is a good distraction and I learnt it at a gaming con, which is can be perfect for in those downtime moments when you are getting to know people.

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (4):[/COLOR]

[i]I'll probably get grief for this one, but there is very little game to be had in Pairs. It is a dead simple push your luck game that can be played no matter your mental condition [i](aka, during a late night at a pub)[/i]. There isn't anything wrong with the game, there are just so many other games I'd rather play in that situation that I'd never pick Pairs.[/i]

A heck of a lot of fun for such a simple premise. Clever and uncluttered luck pushing game with lots of reskinning potential to suit individual tastes for those who find numbers too abstract.

I love the idea, and the artworks.

A quick press-your-luck pub-style card game where players play until there's a loser, not a winner.

I finally remembered what card game I know of where there is no winner, yet one loser: Old Maid. This is a much better game. If Old Maid is present in every home, Pairs deserves to be as well.

Played this for the first time at a Buffalo Wild Wings.  It's the perfect "restaurant" game: just a deck of cards and not too much to think about.  Plenty of luck and press-your-luck involved.  Even a tiny bit of take-that.  For all the luck involved, it can create some tension!  Enjoyed it!

RATING: 7
This fantastic card game has its beauty in its simplicity. It's a deck of cards, more or less, and you can play a whole lot of different games with it. Most games play really short meaning it's easy to play while waiting for everyone to show up. 
I think the only big problem with the game is if you play some of the many different possible games/variants, the rules start to get muddled and you forget which game you are playing. That't not a problem with the game itself, though, but rather an issue of us not separating the individual games/rules in our brains.

What a great, simple game. A push-your-luck affair that lasts just a few minutes, Pairs does feel like it could be a classic pub game. There a several themed decks and each comes with a variant. A buddy ordered a bunch of these, and some variants are better than others. All are available online. Try the continuous version…

This game is very good for what it is.  They make no qualms that this is a very light "beer and pretzels" game that is very much filler.  You just need to try and not get a pair.  Played with three players could be more interesting with more players.  I give it a 7 for a light game.  I would rather play something like Red7 but this is better with more players

Very simple push-your-luck game but still good fun: lightened the mood at the table after an anticlimactic longer game, which is what it's there for. Think I'll be looking at some of the variants (and there are lots of them!), because otherwise this is a half-trick pony.

Pairs is a super simple push-your-luck game based on Blackjack. Pairs is also a versatile deck (10x10, 9x9, 8x8 down to 1x1) that has a free booklet with rules for 15 more games. So far I've mostly played two variants of the basic game: Continuous Pairs and Port. The former certainly lived up to its billing of "a new classic pub game" with hand after hand past midnight at the end of an old friend's birthday party. The latter results in one winner rather than just one loser and has been a big hit with my games group. Both play with up to 8 players - perfect for the end of the night.

Probably the best $0 I've ever spent on a game!  (I saw this online, figured I could make it with my prototype cards from Amazon, and did in about 5 minutes).  Great little filler game!

March 2015: Ok, so this isn't really a game.  But since there's one loser and everyone else is a winner, it means I actually win it a lot.  Ha, ha.  That's got to be worth something.  Seriously though, it's definitely worth the money to bring this out at the start of a gaming session while waiting for others to arrive or at a restaurant.  13 plays in and it's still fun.

RATING: 8
I really like to push my luck. This is a very simple version of that. The deck has 1 "one", 2 "twos", 3 "threes",... 10 "tens". Everyone draws a card, and the lowest card goes first. The active player has two choices. Push their luck to draw another card and hope to NOT pair up one of the cards in front of them and gain as many points as the number of the card. The other option is to cut your losses and take points equal to the lowest card in play for all players. Points are bad, and players lose when they get to a pre-determined amount. My only real complaint is that there isn't a winner, but only one loser instead. I guess that keeps it from being player elimination at least. A good filler to fit in while we were waiting for someone. There are so many versions of games that you can play with this deck of cards as well. One of my other favorites is called, Deadfall.

Push your luck pub game in the blackjack style, but multiplayer with only one loser. You can manage the odds and do some clever things (for a certain level of clever - this game uses more than just one brain cell. Uses around 3 of them). Of course playing the continuous variant, like one does.

After playing this a bunch, I've actually grown to like this game more.  The game itself hasn't gotten better, but I have found that its accessibility, quick play time, and the single "loser" in a game lends itself to being a very good icebreaker/filler.  The high player count is also a major bonus.

1 play, 3er

It's a very simple push-your-luck game. The deck has cards numbered n=1-10, n copies each. Everyone is dealt one cars face up, lowest begins. On your turn either hit (get another card) or pass and take the lowest face up card on the table. If you hit and get a duplicate of your last card, you bust -- take that card; shuffle all cards and repeat. Game ends if anyone's taken cards sum to 21(?) or more = loser. 

There's not much to the game. OK way to waste a little time, I suppose, but I wouldn't miss this if I never played it again.

I'm a fan of classic pin-up art, so I thought the Barmaids deck would be a fun one to have. The style is very reminiscent of Alphonse Mucha-- with the heavy lines and clean shapes.  Very nicely designed EXCEPT that the beers that the maids are (supposedly) holding are absurd -- basically levitating in the air in places where she clearly can't possibly be holding them.

Yes I know some people will think this is a silly quibble.  It's a fun game, but when you're buying an extra deck just for the art, the art matters.

A very quick, very simple "beer & pretzels" game.  Rules are simple but it's a decent challenge and fun with a group of people.  There are also a number of variations and different games you can play with a deck, and a downloadable pocket-size book to teach you all of them.

it basically works as fun, quick and exciting. On the downside its repetitive and has little in the way of strategy.

Kind of a brilliant idea.  Simple -- a triangular deck (1 of "1", 2 of "2"s, and so on up to 10 of "10"s.) -- perfect for an almost infinite retheming -- although they are pasted-on themes.  Easy to learn, deceptively deep -- a bit like poker and casino games, as was the designers' intent.  Sounds like there's not much to it -- until you give it a few rounds.  Easy to teach, fast to play, and fast to play again.

RATING: 6
Pairs is a super quick press your luck game.  The deck consists of cards numbered 1 - 10, where the value of the card is also how many are in the deck.  Everybody starts with a random card in front of them.  The lowest value card goes first.  On your turn you take a card, or take points equal to the lowest card on the table.  If you take the points, you start a new round.  If you take a card, play moves on to the next player, unless the card matches one you already have on the table, in which case you get that many points.  You play until someone loses with 16 points.

The game is fairly random, but given how quick it is, that's not so bad.  This game would be a quick way of selecting start player for the next game, or who buys the next round.

Five card draft: 6
This variant plays almost a bit like Knizia's Los Banditos or Schotten Totten. A line of cards in the middle are up for grabs and cards of different numerical values are played on opposing sides of the card. The higher sum total on either side of the card will determine the winner. Light, mediocre and time-filler. Nothing spectacular.
Basic pairs: 6
A generous rating to begin with, but as a filler, it is adequate. I pull this out during a break in gaming and folks were snacking. It is an acceptable game that involves minimal thinking. Basic pairs is fine. I think continuous pairs would be better. We play a "worse of three" situation where first to collect three losses ends the game. Not much strategy involved.

After Kickstarting Pairs and reading the rules I wasn't too excited. However I chucked it into my game bag last night as a possible end-of-night filler. Result? AWESOME!
The game is (as it says on the box) the perfect pub game - easy, fun, tense & fast. We ended up playing several dozen hands and, rather than betting, quickly started playing for the dubious honour of wearing "the monkey hat": the loser of the previous round had to wear a silly hat and perform dealer duties. Marvellous.

I don't like so much the initial design. However, a friend used the Pepper & Carrot artwork to make a beautiful version of the game. As it's a triangular deck (1 card valued 1, 2 valued 2 until 10 valued 10), you can play a lot of games/variants.
I really like the "continuous pairs" that is a "push your luck" party game. Do you want to get one more card, taking the risk to make a lot of points ? Or do you prefer to stop, taking immediately a small amont of point ? Knowing the aim is to minimize your own points.
The Sweep variant is also very interesting. Maybe it should be played with less players than the first variant. More complex to explain in 2 words.
And there's almost 20 other variants available. So at least some that should please you. A very nice game that may stay forever in my pocket, ready to be played :-)

Pairs is a great little card game! Would love to play it for money sometime! Not something we break out onto the table often though, but would be great to have to spice up poker night.

Super light, quick easy fun, excellent to teach to 'non=gamers'.  Great filler.  A must have for any collection.

Not the best game over to play for itself but it works well to decide who goes first, picks the next game or makes the cuppa. The gambling variants will most probably work though.

Very simple  push your luck game. Rating is for continuous play variant; base game barely deserves a 2.

Again with the fillers! Yeah, I'm always on the hunt and I quite liked Pairs. My advice is to sit down with a group of friends and start dealing out cards, don't explain the rules. Once everyone has a card, point to the person with the lowest card and explain their options: pass or hit. Explain what passing does, then explain why they want to hit and the risks they're taking. Explain how there's no winner, just one loser, and then go to town. The more you try to explain the game play of this one, the more you're going to lose the group, so just dive in.

Very quick, simple game. Well, very few meaningfull decisions, so more of an activity than a game. Still, it is entertaining.

Very neat in how they qualify games submitted/dev'd to work with the pyramid deck.  Really enjoyable to play too (not the basic pairs game.  that's def too light for me)

Don't expect Pairs to be anything more than it is, and you will enjoy it.

It's everything I imagined:  Something about as long and suspenseful as blackjack, with only slightly more complex rules.  Cool!  Oh, and with sharp graphics.

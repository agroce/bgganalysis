GAME: Twilight Struggle
RANK: 4
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
A couple of reasons why Twilight Struggle is amazing:
-Every game (even a blow-out) is intense.
-Players are in constant agony. 
-There's plenty of luck (card deals & die rolls), but skill still wins.
-Every game tells a story, with a proper beginning, middle, & end.
-It has an incredible learning curve, with many different levels of play.
-I still haven't had a single game of it that wasn't fun.

[First impressions]
Too long and expensive for what it has to offer, despite its fascinating theme. Card driven in a perverse way: the cards make most of the game, not the players. You have to learn most of them, the phase in which they come up and, even then, you must consider if other specific cards have already being played or not, limiting your choices even more. Some rules are unnecessarily fiddly, others are just too luck ridden (the space race, of course) and having recently played Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage has made some of this points even more obvious. It shares with Hannibal one of its biggest flaws, at least from my point of view: just too long for the amount of luck involved.

Way overhyped but still an outstanding game. This is a good introduction to war games, and building games in general. Player interaction will make or break this one, and careful observation is a useful aid. Trust no one.

It was awesome. I loved it.  Much more of a brain-burner than I expected.

The only thing that stopped it getting a 10 was game length, unfinished after over 3 hours.

I'm in two minds about this - I feel I should like it more than I do because the theme is excellent but I suspect to really enjoy it you need to invest the time that will give you a better idea of the cards in the game and truth is there are other games that I'd rather spend my limited time on. Catch 22?

RATING: 9
Yes there is some luck involved in the die rolls, but the hand management and strategic elements of planning where to shore up your control far outweigh that (plus, the luck is largely done in thematic elements of uncertainty and I'm ok with that). One of the most tense games I've ever played, each card carries weight as to when to play it, where you opponent has, where they are trying to score, how they will crush you or lock you out of a region, etc. One of the few games where I really get into it (thematically) and like having a soundtrack on in the background (subtle, tense, classical strings), I just get absorbed into the game. It's a game where having an interest in the material is solidly helpful. One of the highest forms of praise I can offer is that it's a game that I just sit and think about in my spare time, and casually obsess about on occasion. It's a game that has refined (but not formed) my thinking in regards to many other game spaces; hand management, distraction, and risk management.

One thing that makes it over something like Matthews' 1960:MotP for me is that you now have much more granular movements and calculation of influence (instead of just the 4 regions, it's now regions with spots within them and your movement is restricted within the region based on prior influence placement). Second, I find the cards are much more circumstantial in their play compared to 1960 where it was much more cut and dry which cards I'd want to play for the event. In TS, it depends much more on what you want to accomplish since the board is much more granular and scoring comes around multiple times.

A bittersweet element of TS is that it's rules and design overall contain a number of sharp edge cases that ultimately have lead to a general plague of errata and clarifications (in similar ways to 1960, but many more in quantity). This makes it much more difficult for new players to learn how to plan and play properly, but does create some rather novel strategic and tactical plays, and is one of the reasons that I do just sort of sit and think about the game.

The greatest downsides are that new players don't understand the ebb and flow of the game (which makes sense as that comes with experience), it takes a while to play, and you have a ton of cards you have to learn (this part sort of blows). Second, scoring can be sort of convoluted to learn at first, and there are a number of times that doing anything outside of battleground spots just doesn't make sense which is unfortunate. Last; it's solidly not a game for everyone; some people don't like the card management of having 110+ cards to learn and understand the optimum placement and possibilities just to be competitive or at least solidly dig into the game (I dig that aspect, but I understand why others won't). All that said, I'll gladly play a game if I have the time and a willing opponent.

Great 2-player CDG.  Dripping with theme and history, extremely tense throughout.  Deluxe edition has great production quality.  Only complaints are that dice-rolls can be brutal, and because all enemy events trigger when played for Ops, card draw can screw you.  But overall a fantastic game.

A really well built CDG that covers it's theme like no other. It's very engrossing and overall a great experience for the quick playing time (experienced players). It's inherent flaw is that if you don't get scoring cards while you're opponent does you are at a disadvantage. It's a catastrophic disadvantage if you are not intimately familiar with the game and your opponent is. In other words both players need to be of equal skill level to compete in this game.

A game I really enjoy that I never get to play enough.  It isn't overly difficult to teach, but I have learned that it is off-putting to people when they make plays but you have cards that can undo everything they just did.  Not knowing what is in the card decks is a hurdle for new players.  If you have someone that you can play this with repeatedly it becomes such a great game.

Now with the release of 1989 Twilight Struggle is seeing less play.

RATING: 10
Quite simply the greatest strategy game created. TS is not for everyone, but for hardcore strategy fans, it doesn't get better than TS. Learning curve is steep and you will likely get crushed by more experienced opponents the first few times, but once you start to understand the strategy, there's nothing like it. 

Time investment wise, a game that runs to "final scoring" will normally take about 3 hours. However, the game can end much sooner than that as well (VP victory, defcon suicide, Europe control). 

One of the great features of TS is that there are several paths to victory. If you find yourself closed off on one front, you can pursue another strategy. For instance, I found myself dominated in South America, North America, Asia, and Middle East in one game. However, I noticed my opponent was thin in Europe and only controlled West Germany and Italy. I went all-in on a European control strategy and managed to win the game. 

This sort of dynamic is what makes it so great. You can't simply "dominate the board" and automatically expect to win. You have to be cognizant of bad events, hand-reduction cards, European control, etc, etc, etc.

Also fwiw, the game is pretty educational. A lot of the Cold War era events I was not aware of before the game (e.g. Yuri & Samantha, Aldrich Ames, Grain Sales to Soviets).

A very good wargame-ish Cold War card-driven game. Very tense a lot of the time, and the theme is very well implemented. DEFCON status, the space race, and all the events and ways you can try to influence nations just add up to an intense experience that is very thematic. Very fast paced and tense, though the cards can cause big swings of luck for one of the players sometimes.

As CDGs go, this is incredible. For anyone to turn "The Cold War" into anything this tension-filled and interesting is an achievement. This reminds me of Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage, but with much more going on, much of it quite subtle -- yet satisfying.

Very steep learning curve. I was close to giving up. The rules aren't complicated, but grasping what is going on and being able to form a sensible strategy was difficult for me.

Just wow - ridiculously tense game about the Cold War that matches the theme with the game superbly. Everyone must play this game at least once. The feeling that you get when you NEED to succeed in a space race roll so that you can dump ANOTHER card on the space race in the same turn via the bonus so that a war is avoided is just memorable. The fact that the gf is part Russian only adds to the allure.

The theme is caught quite well, but I couldn't see a longtime strategy. Overall you just do what your cards allow you to do and this is really luck dependend. I like the mechanic, that no one is allowed to let the war escalate, but I think this feature could have made more dominant.

Once we had a few proper games under our belts this established itself as a firm favourite, with the mechanics well suited to the ebb and flow of the cold war. I particularly liked the way in which countries with low stability numbers are prone to coup attempts, and the judicious use of realignment rolls makes these very powerful at the right time.

Provided you know the deck and some of the nasties hidden in there, it's an outstanding game. Really top-notch.

Great atmosphere in this game. Even my wife likes it.Have had a few plays now and reminds me slighty of Wilderness War in that one side builds up a lead and the other chips away at it.Lots of different strategys and never enough cards to do what you need to do - always the hallmark of a good CDG in my view.

Looking forward to the deluxe remake.

A terrific game.  Great flavor and a terrific use of the Card Driven mechanic.The twist on forcing players to play opponent events is very welcome and a needed change from the traditional.  That the graphics (all down the line - bad box, boring counters, blah map) are completely bland and lazy is the only black mark. 

AFter more playing, lowered my rating a bit.  Just a little too white bread in the end and, strangely, doesn't pull me back to it again...played it maybe 5 times and that was enough for me.

The Cold War can get a reputation for being a pretty long and tedious affair, not quite as exhilarating as the explosions and flying bullets of WWII or the Civil War. Twilight Struggle captures the tension of the Cold War and displays the gravity of the situation in which we were living during that time, making it one of the most rewarding board games ever designed.

The gameplay is both smooth and effective, not simplifying the history, but instead bringing it alive through global domination and three different eras. Due to the design of the card play, you'll have cards that help your opponent, adding to the theme of having insider information via spy tactics or that your efforts will trigger consequences outside of your control. 

A tight game that is more epic than you realize while playing it, Twilight Struggle is deservedly a modern classic
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
10 turns or less, each turn you'll have 8 cards (additionally the China card) to be played in 6 rounds per turn, most of the cards can be used to do either realignment/ space race/ trigger event/ place influence/ attempt coup, mostly to control some countries, scoring card is a must-play before the turn ends or you'll lose. If you use opponent's card for any action except space race, your opponent gets to play the event on the card, you want to avoid this as much as you can. Starting with headline phase then action rounds then military operations status check. The game ends if any player controlled all European battleground countries during Europe region scoring or any player gets 20/-20 points or highest score by the end of round 10 or any player trigger DEFCON 0. The most special thing about TS is the various way you can use the cards. Most of the time I just check the operation point on the card & whether the opponent's event will affect my territory badly or not then take the best action with the card without really paying attention with the historical events.

Wow.  One of the best game designs ever.  I spent my first play in awe of how it all comes together.  I kept thinking to myself "This shouldn't work" and "This game should be terrible," but it isn't.  Somehow it all works brilliantly.

My two plays were great and I do hope to play it more.  You need several plays before you can hope to play it well.  Not only do you need to know the cards, but you have to understand the tempo of the game and when scoring can occur to have any chance.

Good game with very subtle strategic elements. It's certainly rougher than 1960. Several design elements seem unnecessary at first blush - e.g. adding 1 more card in play after turn 3? Different roll values in the space race? The dice mechanic for realignment feels overly complicated - old school and unkempt. Of course, the GMT components are poor. Lastly, it plays a touch long and plods along - much like the years it portrays! But setting all that aside, the historic feel is just right and it has a grandness to it which I completely love. The push and pull of superpower's machinations comes off with great aplomb - a feat in itself.  So all in all, a great game that I willingly play - when I have the three or four hours required.

De los mejores juegos no euros, para dos jugadores, de la guerra fr√≠a entre EEUU y la URSS, mapa mundial, con motor de cartas con puntos de operaciones/eventos hist√≥ricos, muy logrados. Aumentas la influencia en tus pa√≠ses, puedes hacer un golpe de estado, avanzas en la carrera espacial... Edici√≥n espa√±ola por Devir, con muy buenos detalles, manual con √≠ndice hist√≥rico comentando detalladamente los eventos, y buenos materiales. Es un juego de lucha por control de influencia en los pa√≠ses, con ambientaci√≥n hist√≥rica, y bastante dependiente del azar de las cartas que te toquen y de tiradas de dados, aunque un jugador experiementado lleva siempre las de ganar. Donde m√°s se acusa el azar es en las cartas, sobretodo son decisivos los momentos en que salen las de puntuar las regiones. Otro aspecto azaroso que no me gusta nada, es el jugarte cierta carta a un dado con apenas modificadores... o ninguno! Como en la carrera espacial. Por muy "tem√°tico" que sea, jugarte a un dado repetidas veces y siempre a mismo porcentaje (ej a 50%) que avances y consigas (o no) puntos directos y ventajas es algo que me da alergia en los juegos: no premia al mejor jugador, y me parece una salida f√°cil y nada elegande de hacer reglas, que l√°stima de dise√±o en esa parte del juego. Es otra filosof√≠a pero que hubiera costado que por cada fallo, tienes por ej, un +1 en el pr√≥ximo intento? Si lo ves tem√°tico: El cohete se ha estrellado, y no aprende la ciencia de la naci√≥n nada de sus errores para la pr√≥xima? Todas las misiones son el Apolo 1??? En juegos de mesa donde cuesta tanto conseguir con estrategias los puntos, estas partes me matan. 
Luego tambi√©n comentar que el juego con o sin AP se hace MUY largo... Todo esto le hace bajar mucho la nota que con ciertos toques, podr√≠a haber sido el juego estrella que tan incomprensiblemente arriba ha tenido siempre la BGG.

Twilight Struggle offers a great number of tactical choices every turn. At the same time, there's room for a long term strategy also. TS has a steep learning curve due to the numerous events on the cards.

Although, I'm not a big fan of area control games, here the interesting theme and the depth of the game keeps me playing.

I just don't seem to get enough of this game. I love the theme and the strategic and tactical choices the game offers. I admit that there's some room for criticism but still TS is a 10 for me.

2016-11-23
Twilight Struggle has remained my absolute favourite for years now. This is actually a small wonder considering my background that years back I did not fancy confrontational area control games. The frustration caused by someone smashing your carefully built sand castle was too much for me. Moreover, the fact that a single die roll could have such devastating consequences was enough to label TS as a game of pure luck. 

However, I kept playing to give the game a chance, and more importantly I kept losing. This convinced me that a game of TS could not be decided by luck alone. There was no way that I would always lose by such a big margin if I was not doing something wrong. So, I became aware how the game is played on two levels, short and long term. In the short term it's all about crisis management and your goal is always in mere survival or delivering the decisive strike. But at the same time you must consider the trade-offs your actions bring you in longer term. Personally I find this trade-off between immediate gain and future benefits the greatest aspects of the game. Usually there are no obvious answers to your problems and it all really depends on what strategy you have chosen.

The Deluxe Version I have in my shelf is absolutely gorgeous. Beautiful art and good quality cardboard make the game a joy. The older editions with the flimsy board and tokens were a bit of pain in the ass to handle, to be honest. You also learn a bit of history while playing the game which is always a major bonus.

If there is something to criticise the game about, it would be the learning curve. There are numerous death traps in the game and losing because of a "stupid" mistake may be bad for the morale. You just have to toughen up and be ready to get smitten before you can walk with confidence.

I have also written a more thorough review of the game here:

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
First and foremost, this is a FUN game.  There isn't as much depth as other CDGs because of the strong possibility of wild swings of fortune - but there's enough to make it interesting.  And, this is a game whose trade-offs are exactly as the designers' introduction states - playability is good, realism/room for long-term Strategy is limited. 

The card draw and the die rolling can make things see-saw very quickly.  You can win in a flash or lose in one, too.  But, you know what, since it's quick and fun, that doesn't seem to matter too much!

The theme is well done and I like most of the event cards: Flower Power, Glasnost, Defectors, Casto, Iron Lady etc, though there is the occasional lapse into something more bland, but not often. The Space Race is nice and the Influence placement (borrowed from Hannibal) is fun.  I like the way nuclear war is treated, although Defcon can be a bit unforgiving.

Card management is critical, of course - and the game is clever enough so that you can't ALWAYS get that right, though there are safety nets.  Possession of scoring cards at the right/wrong time is the MOST crucial factor.

I bought this game because it is number 1 at BGG. It is long and strategic but definitely a euro. At the beginning you don't really know what you are doing, especially if you haven't played before and don't know the cards and how scoring works presented with a chaos of options in a very large map of the world. It deals with cold war which is my favourite historical subject but it isn't a war-game it is rather a political game (yawn).
Update: I have not played this game forever, I can't find anyone to play it with, it has a very inferior solo house-ruled mode which is tedious to play and it has area-control euro-style mechanics which combined with bluffing are enough to put me off, it's up for trading

A modern classic

Beautifully designed game with simple and, importantly, evocative rules. You really feel like you are influencing nations, propping up dictators and sponsoring coups in a global political struggle.

The cards are highly thematic, and although some are a bit too specific for my tastes (e.g. cards like Castro, Nasser, etc should be more generic for use in other countries) the game is really set in its place and time.

Thanks to the digital implementation I now have a way to try this game without having to find another live player locally.

This game absolutely deserves all of the praise it has received.  At around 350 games in, I find this still grabs my attention--the design is just that good.  The more I play it, the more I appreciate all of the little nuances that the game has.    

What's Great: the hand management and position management puzzles to deal with all of those unfavorable opponent events you will almost certainly be dealt; the integration of the theme; the overall board design and the way that it makes different regions play differently (sometimes to very dramatic effect); the sheer amount of depth available in the game despite relatively simple mechanics; the tenseness of the push-pull aspect of the game.

Why it Won't Get Played More (at least live):  It is certainly a game that requires equal skill at both positions, and an equal knowledge of the game (including not only how to manage a particular hand, but how the overall phases of the war are likely to be managed by each side, how to manage the overall game arc in terms of what cards will get reshuffled into what decks and when, etc.).  It's not exactly a game that lends itself to handicapping one side by a set number of victory points (due to the USSR early war advantage in that regard, but late war disadvantage), though you can of course use the standard tournament approach of influence-point handicaps (though not sure how much that would really help a very inexperienced player against a very experienced player).  I also find many people who are put off by the theme and the fact that, at the end of the day, it really just looks superficially like you are only putting chits on a map (the old Avalon-Hill of the 80s complaint of "that just looks boring").  I think a lot of people would find it very interesting if they invested the time to learn it given how beautiful and sound the mechanics of the game are, its just that some are disinclined to make that kind of investment for something that doesn't come in a pretty shiny package. 

If I could play this one more live, it could possibly ascend to become my all-time favorite.

Played it. It was awesome. I can't deny that. It burnt the hell out of me though, so much card text to figure out each round. I need to play a couple more times before I can start to feel the rhythm of the game. - Sept 2011

Played it again, now that I've been boardgaming for a while and absolutely loved it. I've played 13 Days a handful of times but right now I'm leaning heavier in my tastes and because of that I would put this game much higher on my "want to play more" list than 13 days.

I am making an effort to record every game of this that we play.

This is the only game I've ever played where for most of the session, both players feel like they're losing.  The game is designed very well, and makes me feel stupid.  I'm looking forward to playing this more and hopefully becoming a more competent player.  I'm rating it a 7 for now, but we'll see how that works out later.

The more I play this game, the more I like it.  I'm six or so games in, and I feel like I'm starting to understand how to play towards a goal now.  I'm bumping this up to an 8, but it's so mentally taxing that I can't handle playing it too often.

Update: Bumping back down to a 7.  I have this overwhelming sense of dread every time it's proposed.  I just have this "the horror, the horror!" feeling whenever I think about actually playing it.  It's just so mentally exhausting.  It is certainly aptly named, though!

Update: Back up to 8!  The more games I get in, the better I understand the board state and can formulate objectives.  Playing this isn't as painful now, leaving more room to enjoy the depth of the gameplay.

Fantastic, fantastic, fantastic.

It's a time-sink of a game, with matches lasting anywhere from 2-4 hrs, but TS makes each minute feel tense, unpredictable, and exciting.

TS is an area-control style game, but with a significant set of card decks that dictate the flow of the game. Each card is assigned a superpower - the US or the USSR. If you use a card with your opponent's loyalty assigned to it, you get the points, but your opponent still gets the flavor text effect. This makes TS consistently intense and strategic.

I have a degree in Political Science, and I appreciate the level to which GMT has steeped TS in the theme. Both designers clearly know their Cold War history, and playing TS feels like reenacting it, rather than playing a game that just "looks" like it. Each card has a historical event, person, or thing on it, and the effect of the card mirrors this. It is truly remarkable the degree to which the historicity and reality of the Cold War shines through the gameplay. I have already recommended this to my old PoliSci university professor to use as a teaching aid during his Cold War classes.

I don't get this game to the table nearly enough, due to it's length and heaviness, but I doubt I'll ever get rid of it, as it truly deserves a top spot here on BGG. If you want a game that perfectly emulates the Cold War, that draws you in and creates inside your heart the self-same uncertainty and paranoia present during that Era, this is the game for you.

There is beyond my comprehension WHY people say that a game that simulates the Cold WAR IS NOT a wargame (?!)

You have a War-THEME, a historical conflict simulation between two players, DICE rolling, and a good deal of aggression between these two players! THIS IS NOT A GERMAN-GAME!!
TS is a brilliant implementation of the "card driven" system that recreates the historical period of disputes between the United States and the Soviet Union, covering the post World War II in 1945, and the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991.
The mechanics are simple and the idea of "Low intensity warfare" "Control damage" and the "Domino theory" are excellently implemented with the card play and victory scoring.
An extremely intense and demanding game full of stress when played competitively.
TS is not just the Wargame most played among us .... perhaps because it lacks epic flavour of the cavalry charges and the smell of gunpowder :)

A game can last 1:30-3:00h

This game does a good job of evoking the feeling of fighting the cold war.  Sadly, fighting the cold war is very stressful, and stressed out is how I feel when playing.  I also don't like how the game starts from very similar positions so that you can kind of plan your opening out--it reminds me of Chess openings in a way I don't like.  I can see why people like this game, and I'm occasionally up for playing it, but it's mostly not my style.

I love the history this evokes and the alt-history it becomes. 

I love the area influence/control process although I only tolerate the dice chucking part of it. 

I love the delicious agony and timing of playing something that will hurt you. 

I love (although am not good at) turning a disadvantage into an advantage* from the playing of something that may hurt you and I tolerate that the knowledge of cards is an aspect that comes into play here.

I love the back and forth, you go/I go nature of the game and I can tolerate that this can bog play down (in the case of a fight over Europe for example).

Twilight Struggle is a frustrating game for me.  It is easy to play, but it really depends on your memorization of the deck.

It has a lot of clever ideas baked into it, but I don't see it get to the table because you have to play somebody close to your ability to have a competitive game.

Of all the Herman-style CDGs, this one is near the bottom for me, only head of the dregs, crack whores, and hot messes in the genre.

Exquisite theming, very deep gameplay, extremely high replayability.

Cards are interesting enough that you can write a blog article about each one of them, see twilightstrategy.com. Drawing a random hand of 8 out of 40 or so cards ensures each game plays out differently. Most games are super tense back and forth action. It really makes you feel like a cold war commander!

An incredibly deep strategy game.

Games of Twilight Struggle are always interesting and rarely go exactly the same way; my only complaint about this one is the clunky graphic design.

I am somewhat disappointed in the Collector's Edition of this game: while the gameboard and the new cards are a significant improvement over the Deluxe Edition, the miniatures are sub-par and the new influence blocks are completely unusable for several reasons. My current solution has been to ditch the blocks entirely and pick up a set of Deluxe Edition chits, which smooths over most of the major issues. Still disappointing‚Äîthe blocks were such a fantastic idea, implemented extremely poorly.

A bit dissapointing. The cards have too much weight and you have the feeling that your strategy depends totally upon what cards are you dealt with, and not on what you might plan.
I know it's a great game, and I feel if both players get to know the cards (which ones had come out or which one could have your opponent in hand) the game can be way better, and the epic experience that is is supossed to be.
Anyway, I will give it for sure another try.
UPDATING:
After some more plays, and once you actually know the cards, the gaming experience is way better. It's really an epic game, though the cards still have too much weight for me.

I was really curious after reading so much about the goodness of this game and seeing its fast rise in the BGG ranking. I played twice: my partner did not like it at all and I was not very impressed. The small cardboard chits were difficult to handle, the board was way below current standards, and the learning curve looked steep, but I did not have time or interest to test this because, for me, gameplay was kind of boring. I traded it for Alea's Chinatown. Good change.

Only few games put you in the feeling of the theme, and this game makes exactly this with accuracy. The mechanics were very well thought, so it flow with the theme in perfection. The only bad thing in my opinion is the dependence of the english language, not a problem for me and a lot of my friends, but my father would like it so much because of the theme if it was not language dependent, anyway, I understand that this kind of game is a little bit difficult to use iconographies.

Certainly one of the best strategy games I've ever played, it is a masterpiece.

*Twilight Struggle takes the aesthetic of wargaming and marries it to the accessability of modern board gaming. The rules are exceptional; for a game of such scope, it's remarkably easy to understand. 

*Definitively captures the theme - not merely with accuracy, but in the dynamics; players are constantly engaged, jumping at shadows and trading punches, with the whole world teetering on something seemingly trivial like a turf war in Paraguay. 

*every card matters, every card feels like a kick in the guts to play. Yet play them you must - Twilight Struggle IS hand management. Combined with area control that values every single point of influence, you have a game where the complexity comes from the decisions made. 

*there may be better CONsims, but I think for the medium, this is a deserved #1 game and excellent standard bearer for board gaming. I consider the emulation achieved by the medium to be of the highest elegance. Given the component listing could be written on a postage stamp, that you can fit in 3hrs of intense psychological warfare for the fate of the world is art of the best kind.

I very much enjoy the theme (though it's too bad it can't go back to Lenin), and find the card-play tense and interesting.  I like the rules.  However, I don't find it as impressive as others do -- it doesn't seem to compare well to other games at that length and/or depth (I know I'd rather play Through the Ages by a lot, or Roads & Boats, or two games of T&E).

Also, my wife, who has sound judgment on many matters, loathes it after a third game (she won first two as USSR) -- too luckish, too long, no interest in the theme, and despises the asymmetry.

Not really for us, probably.  Interesting, glad to have played it, not very interested in 1960 now, though it's shorter and has no dice.

Excellent game. Bit of a steeper learning curve than most games, but once you get used to it the mechanic is very well thought out. The game is balanced and achieves a fine balance between mimicking historic events, while providing room for the players to explore and act on their own accord. I am not entirely happy with some elements such as the China card, but those are just minor niggles.

RATING: 8
4 games played.  The game is simultaneously awesome and compelling, but also has unacceptably high variance luck and die rolls, for my tastes in a long strategy game.  I would be perfectly fine with the luck factor in a 1hr game, but in a 4 hr game it feels too swingy.  For example: Playing a War card such as Indo-Pakistani war, on an opponent who just took India, and has Pakistan.  The effect will be: 1-4: Nothing, 5-6: Gain 2VPs, they lose 3 Influence in India, you get 3 Influence, they lose a large positional advantage of access to southeast asia, you gain that positional advantage.  It would probably take at least 3 cards of placement just to counteract the effects of one die roll.  Coup rolls are similarly high variance and of critical importance.  There are also cards for which it is much, much better to draw the card than your opponent (nuetral large value cards, certain key events), and cards that are almost universally poor to draw (scoring cards and '1' cards in most situations).
That said, I do really like the game, even while the high variance of a relatively low number of 1d6 rolls annoys me.  There is a lot of tactical and strategic depth, and many things to learn and analyze about the cards and the game.  Highly recommended for anyone who will not be bothered by the luck factor in a long game.

Have always hated politics in a game, especially one that seem like so from the initial outlook.

Bought the game out of commitment but have never been too encouraged to play it due mainly to the theme that does not entice me.

After the first play with the insistence from a close friend, I was quite taken aback. 

Though not a war-ish bullet flying game, it does have quite a few good moments where the decision of your actions(cards) would make some global differences. The multiple ways in winning the game is a big plus.

After a few more tries, I find this game to be quite well done. If not for the theme, I would have rated it higher.

The near open-endedness of the CDG aspect was the flavour of the system that brought me into this game. Rated at heart a 3 now brought to light to a respectable 7. (8 if it was themed differently)

I know there has been a great deal of discussion lately about whether this is the best game in the recorded history of man, or if it is the best game in both the past but also future history of mankind and all the galactic races. Well, only time and it's keeper, Timelord Grzlach will tell for sure, but I'm leaning towards the latter.

I recognize that this is a solid design and I honestly really like the core ideas. The deck management, the domino theory simulation, the tension around playing cards as events or ops and when to do so. That's all great stuff.

Unfortunately for me there are a few things that really get in my craw and drag down my enjoyment. I don't really like the back and forth of the influence play. To me it feels more like an irritating slap-fight than a tug-of-war. I can't really explain why. I'm also not crazy about the USSR coming out like gangbusters early on and the US having to play crisis management until the initiative swings to them. I don't mind this in other games, like No Retreat, but for some reason I don't like it here. The way the defcon system ties into this annoys me as well since a clever USSR player can make it so the US simply can't fulfill their military ops on some turns. I don't like the feeling of being handcuffed to that extent.

My other complaints are basically niggling personal preference things. I hate Red Scare/Purge and especially the possibility of it recurring. I had it played three times on me one game. Even Twilight Strategy says it can simply make you lose. Why include it? Quagmire and Bear trap are similarly loathsome. The cards are too one sided in their effects. They don't do anything interesting to the game state and they're no fun to be on the receiving end of. It's a negative play experience. In my last game my USSR opponent could have headlined Red Scare on turn one and Dominated Europe right off the bat because I had a poor hand. He didn't because we both hate the card but it leaves a sour taste in my mouth.

I also dislike the dice rolling essentially on principle. There are few enough rolls that a couple swingy results could impact play in an unpleasant manner. I would almost always prefer some kind of bidding or card resolution than a dice roll. When and how frequently the scoring cards come up is a similar issue.

All in all I understand why this is well liked. It's got depth of strategy with a non-insignificant luck element and it's quite replayable. It's definitely not for me, though. Every time I play it I'm miserable. The best bullet I ever dodged was when this was out of stock during the GMT tough economy offer and I got Combat Commander instead.

Good game, but so not for me. I get way too irritated playing it. I hate the fact that most of the time, I'm choosing the lesser evil - there is no satisfaction for me in that. I am happy when I do something well - here, I can do good 10% of the time, all the rest is damage control. I hate it when I'm forced to score a region where I'm weak: not only do I lose victory points in a major way, I also lose an action for my troubles. It feels like being kicked when I'm down. Some of my wargamer friends loved it, but I was hating it even when I was 3 VPs away from winning. I think I will stay away from now on.

The game of games for 2 players.  The card event/play system is fantastic at creating tension and forcing hard tactical choices, while the map play provides context and opportunities for strategic planning.

It's not that hard to teach the rules to someone willing to dive in and accept a loss in their first game.

A very interesting 2-player asymmetrical game during the Cold War. Congratulations to the designers for creating such a nice historical game that is easy to play in a couple of hours. It has a bit of luck and randomness but I guess it's due to the nature of the game and the aspect of uncertain events in war games but I'm no expert here to have a clear opinion. The 2015 Deluxe Edition that I own has excellent production values and it's truly nice to see when it's being played on the table.

RATING: 7
Decent game, though I don't quite understand why it's at the top of the BGG game list. Effectively it's a 2-player Risk-style game with a few different slightly fiddly combat mechanisms. Granted, I haven't tried all the various Risk variants that abound, so maybe there aren't any/many that specialize on a 2-player experience?

From a game design perspective, there doesn't seem to be a strong advantage to using either coup nor realign. It feels like the designers had to add the military track scoring simply to force players to coup, or else there wouldn't have been any dice rolling in the game and it would have just been an abstract strategy. Even still, it feels like you could largely ignore the dice and play deterministically, to win (which I did and did).

On a thematic standing, I didn't feel like the game really accomplished something worth putting it in the top of the BGG ranking. The various tracks that go up and down seem too mechanical to really give me a sense of theme. When cards are played as events, they often seem to do nothing more than what one might do on a regular turn, but forced to make a specific move, exactly as the card directs. There's no greater world beyond adjust influence, realign, and coup.

The "battleground" countries, again, felt very mechanical. I would have preferred that these states provide resources or allowed me access to other states, or something, to make me get a real world/historical feel for why those particular nations matter and the other ones do not. I should want to hold them for strategic reasons not scoring purposes.

And I also sense that a player who receives more scoring cards is going to be the one to win the game most times, since they know where they need to target before the other player and can (largely) choose when to call in the bean counters. Thematically, this makes no sense and, mechanically, it renders a lot of the strategy moot.

It is a perfectly decent game, by all rights. I have enjoyed playing it several times now. But the only reason I can see for it ranking so high is that it lets you play a Risk style game at 2 players and randomness can throw the game either direction, so you don't have to worry that one person will win/lose all the time, but it accomplishes this randomness in such a roundabout way (the scoring card dispersal) that it probably does not seem to most players like the game was decided by chance.

My thoughts on twilight from one play is that it is either A) a bit linear with alot of traps for players who are new to the game or B) riding on rails because of the hard adherence to theme of historical events. While there is absolutely a potential for two players to really test each others skill to its absolute value with this game, they will both be following a "meta-game" and trying their best to follow it to do well. I wanted more flexibility in strategy, when this is a simulation game first and foremost.

Great game.  The theme is great, the dynamics are fantastic, the sense of the history is great, the swings in the control are great.  Balance issues are fine to me because that's part of the game and its challenge.  The agony of playing a bad scoring card, or having to play one of your opponents action cards is invigorating.  The timing of scoring and the relevance of various regions is brilliant.  The theme and length puts off some people, but some people love it.

Twilight Struggle is a miracle of game design. It's one of the richest and most interesting strategy games ever and certainly the best two player game I've seen. The brilliant mechanics of hand management and DEFCON perfectly capture the feel of the Cold War. You feel like you're constantly fending off crises, which might not sound fun, but trust me--it is. 

There are countless incredibly clever gameplay mechanics here. The scoring cards hidden in the deck with the rest of the cards--you are always paranoid your opponent might have one, and any aggressive play into a new region is taken as evidence. There's the way Europe stabilizes quickly and locks down into firmly entrenched battle-lines, so the conflict must spill out across the globe--just like the actual Cold War. In the Late War, the threat of Wargames amplifies the paranoia even further. 

The asymmetry between the two powers adds quite a bit to the game's replayability. The US starts with more influence scattered across the board, but a good USSR player will seize the initiative in the early war and make more attacks than the US can possibly counter. Throughout the whole game, the USSR typically starts off each round with an aggressive coup. The USA can only hope to slow the Soviets down at first, but by the Mid War has a strong counterpunching ability. The USA benefits from better hand management options, too, and is at less risk of blundering into a nuclear war. 

Some minor criticisms: first, the board doesn't stay flat properly. The game is a bit dependent on dice rolls--some "war" cards in particular feel too swingy. The game is slightly unbalanced in favor of the USSR, so that needs to be rectified by providing the US player 2-3 extra influence to start off. It's also true that knowledge of the cards is so essential that a newcomer, even one familiar with strategy games, will get killed by an experienced player 100% of the time. 

Once both players know what they're doing, though, this is a blast.

Twilight Struggle is a thematically rich and engrossing 2-person game.  It has a decently steep initial learning curve, but after a game or two everything suddenly makes sense and fits together very well.

The game is focused on positional contention, for 'influence', played out a world political map (Risk, Axis & Allies).  Turns are card-based (Command & Colors, San Juan, Race for the Galaxy).  Cards are either used as a historical event (printed on card) or for action points.  Both players are sometimes forced to play cards that favor their opponent, and minimizing the damage is crucial.

I really love the event vs. action point aspect of deciding how to use the cards, and also the various possible actions (coup, re-alignment, adding 'influence').  Some of these mechanisms really deserve further exploration in subsequent games.

One down-side, is that some cards (like Aldrich Ames) can unexpectedly end an otherwise tight game in some circumstances.  Perhaps that is part of the nature of card-driven games.

Overall I think Twilight Struggles is a very clever game with a fantastic theme.

It would have been better if the natural flow of the game decides whether a country is a battleground or not. Of course you are a bit stuck to history, but couldn't Fidel appear in Mexico or Nasser in Israel, while maintaining a certain level of historical integrity. This would have made Twilight Struggle much less predictable, since you know from the beginning that Fidel will sooner or later appear in Cuba. 

I also wished TS has some military units in it. So they could provide players with regional powerbases. And where are the hydrogyn and neutron bombs!?

I found the scoring mechanism too complex and not wholly sensible. For presence you only need to control one country. For the next level you need both the most normal and battleground countries. That is a too big leap. The scoring mechanism is also too rough and doesn't have the subtleties of Paths of Glory, from which I believe it is derived.

I also didn't like the way the Afghan and Vietnam War - Bear Trap and Quigmire cards - are handled.

However TS is a good and enjoyable game. A bit blant, perhaps a little bit simple and abstracted to me. There is nothing wrong with that, but the game doesn't really capture the spirit of the cold war. And believe me ... those where scary days!

But until yesterday (8/11/2011), I had not bothered to punch the counters.  What can I say, this is an awesome game! It is more fiddly in execution than a heavy Euro, but not much more complicated.  In fact, I would say it is easier to learn and teach than Agricola.  It is clear to me, even on 1 play that it is a very deep game and the mechanics are beyond clever.  It is as close to a a perfect combination of simplicity of play and richness of theme.  Simply brilliant.

:arrowE: [u]Synopsis[/u]:
First off, why did I ever find this game? Because it was #1 on BGG when I joined the site. Is that a cop-out? Maybe. Does that make me a blind board game mob-rule poser? Maybe. You know what, though? I don't care. The visibility of the title is the only way I would have found it, and I'm glad I did. In essence, this is a game of "crap, I can't play this card... or this card... or this card... or this card." Spoiler alert: you have to play all those cards, Jim. Deal with it.

:arrowE: [u]What I like most[/u]:
Calling this a "hand management" game sounds so wimpy, but effectively this is the most grueling hand management game in existence. The fact that I might have a banner decade and play all of my cards and YOU play all of my cards can be entirely undone by next decade, when my USA hand is filled with USSR cards, and the careful progress I made before is eroded before my eyes. This erosion is further heightened by better knowledge of the cards as repeat plays take place, making choices even more layered and nuanced. "No, I can't play that scoring card yet, not yet, not yet, not yet. no no no, not yet... crap, now I HAVE to play it since I can't keep it until the next decade!"

I was born at the the very end of the Cold War, but this game captivates me and has truly renewed my interest in learning everything about the actual historical Twilight Struggle, as it were.

:arrowE: [u]What I like least[/u]:
A negative rating comment describes this as "Candyland for adults--draw a card, do what the card says, repeat. At some point, the game ends." It's a card-driven game, and the choices required to play which card at what point and do what with operations points in the meantime is excruciating... in a wonderful, wonderful way. At the risk of soundling like a campy, self-aggrandizing resume tagline ("my greatest weakness is that I'm TOO good at what I do..."), the agonizing tension of Twilight Struggle is both the best and the worst part of the game.

[hr]
Currently, my most satisfying and thematic victory was the result of my headlining "Cuban Missile Crisis" while my wife headlined "Missile Envy." She had to draw "We Will Bury You," and as the Soviet player, played it as an event immediately. Normally this would be a great boon to anyone, but "Cuban Missile Crisis" set DEFCON at 2, and "We Will Bury You" degrades DEFCON by 1, meaning that she inadvertently caused nuclear war, and lost immediately. But oh man! The interplay between the theme of those cards was amazing. Ach! What a game. I was sweating by the time that took place. Just incredible.

Utterly incredible card based WARGAME. I really enjoy this one. While it isn't my favorite for a number of reasons, I have to acknowledge this one as perhaps the most elegant among the competition. Really a lot of fun and because of the nature of the game, increasing knowledge of cards on repeated plays just make it get continuously better.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
After 1 play: very interesting mechanics, rating is 8 due to the big amount of luck and the lack of means to manage it. A good card draw gives a player better chances of winning, bad die rolls can destroy one's strategy.

After 3 plays: I like the game more and more, it shows quite some depth that I could not see in the first play. It is not a 10 just because an unlucky draw can leave you without a strategy. If your opponent will have throughout the game all or most of the scoring cards and he/she plays well, than you stand almost no chance. It is in my top 10 games for sure

After 8 plays: rating changed to 10. Best strategy game!

Wonderfully unique game. Well-designed, great pieces and board. My biggest contention is that the game relies heavily on die rolling mechanics. I'm really not sure how you could altogether eliminate those mechanics though so I recognize it as a necessary evil. However, you hate to see entire turns of strategy and planning wasted on a bad dice roll or two. As such, I rate the game lower. If die rolling wasn't so infuriating to me, I would probably give this a 9 or 10.

This game is absolutely great until you have a game where the luck of the cards and dice rolls do not balance out for the duration of the game and you are continuously left with the shortest straw. It captures the feel of the theme very well and can be very exciting. The flow of the game is great, but it does take 3-4 hours to play all the turns which is just on the limit of outstaying its welcome. For a feel and strategy I'd give it a 10, but the sometimes game-breaking luck dependance is too much and ruins the game from time to time. I think a game of this caliber and depth should not be quite as luck driven as it is. However, when the luck favours both players equally, it is great and tense with real theme.

I like this one a lot !

Lots of difficult decisions to make keeps the players involved all the time. Where to put influence (like Go you would like to play in many places of the map but you will have to choose among them), how to play your hand of cards the most efficient way, what regions of the world to seek domination, and finally how much chances should you take with the dice. 

All that make the game a really interesting one to play.

Hard to find any fault in this game.  It's a tense struggle to keep your opponent off balance, trying to maximize events that are favorable to you while minimizing the damage from the events favorable to him.  The Cold War theme resonates with me having grown up during that time.  That said, I didn't think I would like a game based on the Cold War, but this game proved me very wrong.  

Update:  the one fault I do have with this game is, in order to play it well, you need to understand all the cards in the deck.  What I mean is, if you cracked open the game and played it the first time and did not review the deck, you would not likely play it very well.  That is OK as it would be an interesting, chaotic experience.  But having foreknowledge of events that WILL come at some point is crucial to playing it well against an experienced opponent.  Since the game is replaying the Cold War, it would be a better game for me if the players could not see into the future, so to speak, and plan their play based on events that they know will come at some point.

Chock full of interesting decisions- but there is too much opportunity to get burned by bad luck in the cards and, to a lesser extent, the dice.  I found the spelling errors on the first edition game board to be embarassing at first, but they are actually not a big deal.  There is a certain charm to influencing Chili.  The spelling errors are fixed in the second edition.  Knowledge of the over 100 unique cards is very useful for correct play.  After repeated play, balance does not seem to be an issue.  The USSR player has an advantage, but it does not seem to be overly significant.  The theme is excellent for this game, the rules are simple and the mechanics are fairly innovative.

Un excellent jeu, plus jeu de soci√©t√© que wargame pour √™tre honn√™te. Avec une situation tendue du tout d√©but √† la toute fin de la partie. Aucun temps mort, aucun r√©pit. Si l'URSS ne gagne pas une confortable avance d√®s le d√©but, il est tr√®s difficile d'aller jusqu'au bout. Mais au moins, elle peut s'amuser √† vendre ch√®rement sa peau !
A mon avis, un jeu √† consommer avec une certaine mod√©ration cependant, √† cause de cette tension permanente. Je ne ferais pas deux parties d'affil√©e (mais je ne pense pas que je serais souvent confront√© √† ce cas de figure).

Automatic english translation:

An excellent play, plus board game that wargame to be honest. With a tended situation of the whole beginning at the any end of the part. No idle period, no respite. If the USSR does not gain a comfortable advance as of the beginning, it is very difficult to go until the end. But at least, it can have fun to sell its skin dearly!
With my opinion, a play to be consumed with a certain moderation however, because of this permanent tension. I would not make two parts of sharp (but I do not think that I would be often confronted with this case of figure).

I'm really STURGGLING to understand why this game is so popular with so many players.

Yes, I understand that the die-rolls may even out over time, but if die-rolls fail/succeed on critical moments, such as right before a scoring event, it can be critically damaging to the game.

Also, the variability of card draws can be significant.  As Russia, I drew very critical cards like Marshall Plan and NATO and was able to deny those each time on my turn.  If a person gets a significant amount of "other colored cards" or the scoring is clustered and favors someoen who is able to place there, it can be difficult.  Central and South American were both scored on the same turn, and Russia didn't have any opportunity to even play any influence over there during the first round of the Mid Game, so it caused a huge point swing, which was literally unavoidable.

The fun and strategy of a wargame without anything that bogs wargames down.  Lots of replayability even when you know the cards.  Drenched in theme, and the gameplay forces you to use tactics like the actual cold war.  All this and my wife likes it too.

The Deluxe Edition adds some extra cards and has nicer board and chits.

Most thematic game on its topic. Its a very interesting game design, which catches the cold war theme extremely well and offers a lot of strategical choices. On its basic its a really a mix of hand management and area of Control throughout the game, which has these incredible moments of bluffing and guessing what your opponent has on his hand and what his next moves are. There is a small minor point to this game, which is the the nessecity of knowing the cards as good as humanly possible. For the first games you may play cards in a way where it might seem useful, but the lack of knowledge of specific cards effect might screw you over (like putting a lot of influence as USSR into Japan and later in the game "Japan Mutual pact" event is played and cost you like 2 turns from previous turns, because USA immidiately regains control of Japan due to its effect). Some may mention, that the longer play time might be an issue, but i cant see that as a problem personally, because the theme as well as the game mechanics themselves are so catchy, that you absolutely lose your feeling for time. 
Last but not least is the concern of some people, that TS is pretty luck dependand. I can't fully agree on that. Yes Coups and realignements have some sort of luck, because of the nature of dice (even tho you can guess the equity of succes/failure, but these are sometimes risky plays and the quantity of these moves are pretty much capped by the DEFCON Track. So i would personally say, that out of the 156 Cards or so played, no more then 15-25 coups will be played throughout the game.
I highly suggest to get the Deluxe version, because of the better Balance due to the new Cards.

This has easily become my absolute favourite 2-player game.  Love it!  Still not old.  Has a lot of replay potential.

I like the theme.  I think the structure of gameplay captures the theme very nicely, and allows for some very tense and exciting moments.  The game, however, can often become more about damage control, as you are forced to play events that are extremely beneficial to your opponent.  But then again, that captures the spirit of the cold war.

A really great theme very well implemented in the game mechanisms and the cards.  This is a top notch heavy two player game.  

Many heavy two player games are standard war games involving armies and such.  This is nice twist on the idea because while there are some abstracted wars, it's really a clash of influence and control of countries.

The one drawback is that you really need to learn the many cards pretty well to play competently, and if one player knows the cards better than another then that's a huge advantage.

But that's not that big of a deal.  It's worth working through.

Deleted review at http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/104292 (now wish I hadn't done that). I have a bit of a love/hate relationship with the game which, with thought and experience, may simply boil down to the existence of neutral events at all. If someone draws power-neutrals (Red Scare/Purge...) they have an advantage which isn't inherently offset by the, "if I'm drawing theirs, then they're drawing mine" kind of thing that the actual sides provide. Still, especially with updates, a well-produced and most impressive game which I think every serious gamer should at least experience.

+ Tricky... On one hand it presents many different choices and strategies. Includes a whole lot of theme, bluffing and opponent reading. Mechanically, this game is a thing of beauty.
- Now, I don't mind imbalanced games, and this one is imbalanced. What stops me from rating this game a 9-smth is the fact that this 3-hour game can end in a luck swing. Get one or two really bad hands, and you're done, whatever you do.

RATING: 8.5
Never got to play it. Really wanted to, but I had exhausted the goodwill of my opponents just in teaching it. For non-gamers, without the hype, this is a difficult game for them to connect with (unless they love the cold war era).

This is only a 9 because I haven't played it much.  This is a great game.

Now I understand why this is currently #1. Tons of fun to play thanks to the high tension between the long-term strategy on the game board and the short-term tactics of hand management (or more accurately 'damage control' in some cases.) Lots of theme - this game really made me feel like I was coordinating Soviet Russia's operations during the Cold War.

In case anyone cares about my opinion, I wouldn't consider this a 'wargame.' Good yes, war no.

The rules in this game are really obtuse for being ranked #1. The people I play against still wont grasp some of the core mechanics of the game three hours later when the game ends. I find my self explaining how coups work over and over. The theme is pretty cool, and this is a game I would pull out for some of my political junkie friends, but at the end of three hours of play I am often left thinking, that was it? I certainly have more fun playing other games than this one. 

Also, you have to know the cards and what order they come in to be good at this game. Card memorization isn't something a game should reward, and it has nothing to do with the theme. Nixon wasn't able to pull out his crystal ball and look into the future and say "Ah... around this time period of history NATO will be formed, I'll plan on that then"

Edit:

The more I play the more fun this game gets. I think it is because both my opponent and I know the rules better so the game flows.

I love that this is a contemporary war game in a sea of (older) historical period stuff. Accessible enough for most people, and very rich in strategy. Elegant system, seems well balanced with the Chinese Civil War variant. Need a few more plays, but this may make it to a 10 for me.

I think it can still be a bit of a dice fest and lame card-drawing came on occasion. Strategy can mitigate some, but not all of this ... it'll never be a 10.

Purchased 6/08. Flows very smoothly and rulebook much easier to get into compared to Paths of Glory. After getting whupped in the first 3 games as the US player, I thought it was an unbalanced dog...but now, after a bit more knowledge of the game and cards it appears to be a tense judo like game....received optional cards 105,106 & 108.

Have Csi magazines #19 and 21 with variants.

The new 3rd edition board is really nice, but not enough to justify upgrading

Gut wrenching tension, trying to make the most of your cards, and limit their damage at the same time.  You both look at your hands, and know that whatever you do, you're going to be helping the other player, and afraid that his cards aren't as bad as yours.  You need to balance your play, because if you find yourself way behind in one area, it's a long road back.

A solid 8.  But I have proven that I suck mightily at this game, losing five straight games to new players.  My problem is that I don't balance the regions well, I start winning in one area and get excited, putting too much influence there.

It really does make the cold war come live, and plays very well to the theme.

I really thought that I would hate this game, but I was completely wrong. I don't usually love area control games, but I enjoy how Twilight Struggle handles that conflict. I really love the elements of timing and finding ways to use cards in ways that minimize their benefit to your opponent. The game is driven by cards, so their is definitely a lot of luck involved, but the game is largely about mitigating that luck, which I actually enjoy a lot. The only major drawback for this game is the playing time. If this game took an hour instead of 2-3 hours, then it would rate much higher.

Clever design with more going on than one initially might think. Replicates the paranoid competition of the Cold War as players sink resources into regions simply because their opponent does. A heck of a lot of fun to play.

Only slightly marred by a high luck factor. The game rewards smart use of the cards more than it does simply having a good hand. Having said that, there are occasions where a devastatingly bad hand can scupper your game.

RATING: 10
I just upped this to 10 (from 9) after 30 plays. This last play went down to the wire and my opponent won by 2 points difference. 

This is THE GAME. It creates so much tension and possibilities are endless, choices hard and both players are constantly under pressure. If you like that kind of feel in your games, TS is sitting on the throne.
Only problem is, you have to have a partner that is about the same level as you.
Our whole game takes about two hours now, and is an agonizing delight every time we play it. You also learn a lot from the cold war history and I see the potential of it being used in education (history major here).

First game took us almost 6¬Ω hours including rules explanation but the time just flew away. I was totally into the game the whole time and because I never had to sit and wait long for my opponent it never felt like the game dragged on an on. Very exciting from the beginning to the end. Perhaps my best board gaming experience ever?

Pretty good game but an experienced player always has too much advantage because of knowing the cards.  The board and pieces are cheaply made for such an expensive game. Too much reliance on the luck of single die rolls.  The theme is well represented and does not seem "pasted on" but the play can drag as this is a long game.  More fun can be had with 1960 The Making of a President, which is much more polished.

RATING: 8
We're just getting to the point where the U.S. can actually win.  This is an extremely deep game that requires you to know both players' deck intimately before it has any balance.  I don't like that aspect.  I would prefer balance all along, at all levels of play.

Not my bag...I get why a certain subset of gamers would LOVE this game, but I'll be honest I don't get the universal broad appeal that would be necessary to rank #1 overall. Any history nut is going to love it, but it has some serious deficiencies: Only 2 player. Probably too long for a lot of people. Quite dry. Kind of a steep learning curve (I think it's a huge advantage to "know the cards"). Doesn't feel "wargamey" enough to be a war game and I'm not sure where else it fits well other than straight up strategy...

RATING: 8
My first impression of this game is that I need to play it a lot more. It seems like - for a card drawing game - there's actually quite a bit of strategy involved. 

Not only that, but the tension runs so thick... in my first game, Cuban missile crisis was played, and neither of us wanted to back down, so instead we continued to find ways to maneuver around each other without initiating global nuclear war.

Also, the cards can be rather humorous. I forgot which card it was, but one of the cards read something along the lines of "If you control more battleground states than your opponent, poke them in the chest and gain 2 victory points." Awesome.

-----

Second impression: Yes. This game is as deep as I originally thought. It's one I want to show off. I want to play it with my dad, with my friends, with my wife. I'm finding myself hoping for more two-player game days.

What more can be added to all the accolades thrown at the reigning champion? Sure, it's probably unbalanced, but damn if it ain't one of the games most incredibly evocative of its theme ever made.

As a Eurogamer, rather than a wargamer, I found TS surprisingly easy too play, although I am sure we were not playing optimally - no realignments throughout the game and only one non-card induced coup.  Surprisingly quick end to first game on turn 7 with a US VP win. Scoring heavily in Europe topped with space race points (on which the dice were kind throughout).

Why do designers make games where high dice rolls are good most of the time then switch, as in the space race, with low being good?  Keep things consistent.  Absorbing game, happy to play again.  Recommended to heavy Eurogamers.

One of my favorite games.  The theme is totally engrossing.  The rules at first glance may appear overwhelming to non-wargamers, but it's worth the effort!  The game does a fantastic job of creating tension.  It accomplishes this mostly by forcing players to make plays that will end up helping their opponent.  The trick than becomes figuring out how best to minimize the inevitable damage.

I can't recommend this enough.

RATING: 8.5
Grand scale, card and event driven war game. If you wanna be good, you have to know which cards enter play when, when to trigger an event and which cards to dump in the space race. Ops points are key. Love the cold war feel and tension, you really feel like sitting at the generals desk in Moscow and Washington

RATING: 9
I'm amazed on how strategic this game is and how many historic events that they added into this game. I'm also surprised about how educational this game is. Most of what I now know about the cold war was looking up the card events in the back of the rule book or on wikipedia. If you're a war gamer or even just a history geek, this is one of those games you just need to try out.

Hivatalos magyar kiad√°s! #0002-es p√©ld√°ny:) Nagyon sz√©p! √âs mint kider√ºlt, szerencs√©re csepp√°ll√≥!:)

V√©gre siker√ºlt kipr√≥b√°lni!
Nagyon nagy √©lm√©ny volt, annak ellen√©re, hogy mindk√©t partit buktam. Az els≈ët meglep≈ëen gyorsan, kb. 1 √≥ra alatt. A szab√°lymagyar√°zat is 1 √≥ra volt egy√©bk√©nt, k√©nyelmes temp√≥ban. Nem siett√ºnk, r√° volt sz√°nva az eg√©sz nap.. A m√°sodik parti m√°r elh√∫z√≥dott, t√∂bb mint 3 √≥r√°sra siker√ºlt.

Nagyon prec√≠zen megkompon√°lt j√°t√©kr√≥l van sz√≥, amelyben minden mindennel √∂sszef√ºgg! Nagyon elm√©sek az √∂szt√∂nz≈ë mechanizmusok: pl. az ≈±rversenyben val√≥ lemarad√°s√©rt b√ºntet a j√°t√©k, ha b√©ke van, akkor h√°bor√∫ra √∂szt√∂n√∂z, ha nem vagyunk el√©g er≈ësen jelen valamelyik kontinensen, b√°rmikor p√≥rul j√°rhatunk miatta.
Emellett nagyon j√≥ a k√°rty√°k mechanizmusa. M√©g a legrosszabb (ellenf√©l sz√°m√°ra legjobb) k√°rtya kij√°tsz√°s√°ban is lehet valami j√≥, annyi lehet≈ës√©g√ºnk van. Nem nagyon lehet olyat √©rezni a j√°t√©kban, hogy tehetetlen√ºl sodr√≥dunk a veres√©g fel√©. Persze el√©g j√≥l l√°that√≥, melyik f√©l √°ll jobban, de a ford√≠t√°s lehet≈ës√©ge mindig benne van, √©s √©szen kell lenni v√©gig, nincs megnyert parti.
Tetszik a t√∂bb, l√©nyegesen k√ºl√∂nb√∂z≈ë befejez√©si m√≥d is: pl. atomh√°bor√∫ kirobban√°sa, d√∂nt≈ë pontsz√°m-f√∂l√©ny, Eur√≥pa ellen≈ërz√©se, vagy pedig a v√©gs≈ë √©rt√©kel√©s r√©v√©n. A K√≠na k√°rtya is sz√≠nes√≠ti a j√°t√©kot.

Emellett, √©s tal√°n ez a legjobb a j√°t√©kban: a val√≥s vet√ºlete annyira k√©zzelfoghat√≥, mint tal√°n egyik m√°s √°ltalam ismert j√°t√©knak sem: n√©h√°ny esem√©ny, amire hivatkozik a j√°t√©k, csak n√©h√°ny √©vtizede t√∂rt√©nt, van amelyikre m√©g √©n is eml√©kszem. Nagyon j√≥l siker√ºlt modellje a j√°t√©k a hidegh√°bor√∫nak.

M√©g n√©h√°ny sz√≥t ejteni kell a szerencs√©r≈ël is: a puccsn√°l kev√©sb√© √©reztem a jelenl√©t√©t, az √°tszervez√©sekn√©l kicsit jobban, de tal√°n egyed√ºl az ≈±rverseny az, ahol bosszant√≥ lehet a szerencse szerepe, mert ott kev√©s lehet≈ës√©g van a halad√°sra. De alapvet≈ëen b≈ëven a t≈±r√©shat√°ron bel√ºl van ez is.

A Caylus-mell√© ker√ºl a toplist√°mon, a legfels≈ë polcra:)

Szovjetekkel is kipr√≥b√°ln√°m...
S≈ët, ezek ut√°n az 1960 is √©rdekelne, a rokon mechanizmus miatt. Meg a t√©ma se rossz ott sem!
---
Szovjetekkel k√∂nnyebb, b√°r √≠gy is kikaptam 1 ponttal:)
---
Kicsit rontottam a j√°t√©k pontsz√°m√°n, mert infl√°l√≥dott a szememben a k√ºl√∂nlegess√©ge az√°ltal, hogy kipr√≥b√°ltam az 1960-at. K√©t hasonl√≥ kaliber≈± j√°t√©kr√≥l van sz√≥. Mi lesz, ha a Hannib√°lt is kipr√≥b√°lom v√©gre?:))
---
Amikor 2010 v√©g√©n Vice-t≈ël megszereztem a gy√∂ny√∂r≈± magyar p√©ld√°nyt, egy √©ven bel√ºl j√°tszottam vele 8 partit, de ut√°na sok√°ig nem ker√ºlt el≈ë. Eltelt 3 √©s f√©l √©v, az√≥ta dupla annyi j√°t√©kot ismerek, hasonl√≥ kateg√≥ri√°ban is pr√≥b√°ltam tov√°bbiakat (Hannib√°l, Paths of Glory) √©s most v√©gre √∫jra j√°tszottam vele 2 partit. R√∂viden: √∫jra nagyon tetszik. Sosem tartottam rossznak, de az 1960 kicsit elhom√°lyos√≠totta anno, de most itt is √°t√©ltem szinte ugyanolyan szint≈± izgalmakat. Az egyik partiban ott volt a kezemben a nyer≈ë lap (a 20 ponthoz), de tudtam hogy ha akkor nem siker√ºl a gy≈ëzelem, ha az ellenf√©l kij√°tszik valami meglep≈ët, ak√°r m√©g 2-3 √≥r√°ig eltarthat a j√°t√©k, √©s a v√©g√©n ak√°r el is vesz√≠thetem. Az az igazs√°g, hogy m√©lyebb, mint az 1960, t√∂bb sz√≠nteret kell √°tl√°tni, tal√°n nehezebb kiismerni, de emiatt sokkal hosszabb. Az 1960 lemegy 2 √≥ra alatt rutinos j√°t√©kosoknak, a TS-t nem tudom hogy lehetne ak√°r csak 4 √≥r√°ra leszor√≠tani. Tal√°n ha k√©szs√©gszinten ismern√© mindk√©t f√©l a lapokat? Itt el is √©rkezt√ºnk az egyik k√©nyes ponthoz, ami a hasonl√≥ j√°t√©kokn√°l mindig felmer√ºl: a lapismeret durv√°n sokat sz√°m√≠t. Nyilv√°n kev√©sb√© lelkesen szerzek x orsz√°gban befoly√°st, ha tudom hogy van olyan esem√©ny ami ott le tud null√°zni stb. A lapok ismerete n√©lk√ºl el√©g nagy a lutrifaktor. Ez√©rt besz√©lt√ºnk is a j√°t√©k ut√°n, hogy egyszer majd j√°tszunk egy olyan partit, amire mindketten k√©sz√ºl√ºnk p√°r √≥r√°t a lapokb√≥l.
M√°s: annak idej√©n kicsit tan√°cstalan voltam, hogy mikor √©s hol √©rdemes √°tszervezni √©s puccsolni. Most √∫gy √©rzem kicsit tal√°n jobban √°tl√°ttam, √©s most azt mondom ez a j√°t√©k sava-borsa. √ârezni, hogy mikor melyik f√∂ldr√©szre √©s milyen m√≥don kell r√°hajtani... ennek √©rdek√©ben mindig √©rdemes sz√°mon tartani, melyik kontinens ki√© pillanatnyilag, melyik √©rt√©kel√©s mikor v√°rhat√≥. Ennek kapcs√°n: a DEFCON s√°v zseni√°lisan tematikus, √©s ahogy a val√≥s√°gban is, nehezebb beleny√∫lni az eur√≥pai √©s √°zsiai viszonyokba, mint mondjuk az afrikaiba. Ennek megfelel≈ëen persze a kontinensek √©rt√©ke is m√°s. A puccsot √©n az√©rt szeretem egy√©bk√©nt jobban mint az √°tszervez√©st, mert ott lehet tutira menni. Van olyan eset, amikor egy 1-es dob√°ssal is √©r√ºnk el valamit. Az √°tszervez√©s viszont sorozatos szerencs√©s dob√°sokkal sokkal t√∂bbet hozhat, de ez lutri, el≈ëfordulhat hogy semmit se kapunk.
√ñsszess√©g√©ben nagyon tetszik! Az ut√≥bbi id≈ëben egyre fontosabbnak tartom egy j√°t√©kn√°l a hangulatot. Itt nagyon megvan!!
A m≈±fajban eddig pr√≥b√°ltakb√≥l tal√°n ez t≈±nik az arany k√∂z√©p√∫tnak. Az 1960 k√∂nnyedebb, a TS komolyabb, a Paths of Glory meg akkor j√≥ ha van az embernek egy teljes h√©tv√©g√©je.
Tal√°n m√©g mindig ink√°bb az 1960 fel√© h√∫z a sz√≠vem, mert r√∂videbb √©s magasabb adrenalinnal j√°r, de most a TS is hasonl√≥ izgalmakat adott.

Masterpiece. Intrigue at its best, this 2player game needs dedication due to its long playtime, but rewards you with intense strategic decision-making,turnarounds and a need for constant attention to every move your opponent does, especially since its on soooo many fronts. Very nice job with the real-events based cards and their history presented in the manual. Brilliant.
EDIT: If I had to find a downside, the game has a pretty long playtime, especially during first plays when players are not familiar with card events and pros/cons of USSR/US side. A major reason why this pup sadly does not see much table time.
EDIT: Got a regular-ish gaming frequency now (every few months). I LOVE the game, even though I am not the AP prone guy that likes to take every possibility into consideration and spend hours on the net getting the different strategies and pro/cons of all the cards down. It is maddening how a card drawn by your opponent instead of you or a wrong dice roll can sometimes make the difference between winning and losing. great game!!

My rating has slowly fallen to the current level. Now that I've played 5  games, I think that a few neutral cards (and some events) determine the game. I'd say half of my games have been decided by who drew what (or had atrocious luck) and the play mattered not at all. See my review for more details.

I'm not usually a fan of more intense war games like Twilight Struggle. However, this game has something special. As a history fan, I love the theme of all the cards and how they resolve. The game can daunting at first. After a playthrough, the mechanics make more sense. Still, I can't play this game too often. It is incredibly intense throughout. The hand management takes great skill. It's definitely a game of stamina because a full game took over 3hrs. I enjoy playing Twilight Struggle, I just couldn't do it very often.

Nothing wrong with the game, just not my kind of game.  I rate it as such to help those that use me as a point of reference on which games they think they will enjoy.


I am getting 1960 instead since it plays a lot shorter.  Has too much luck from what I read and the production is very lacking. "Try before Buy"

RATING: 8
Temptative rating for a complex game with just one game at my back.  The setting is interesting, the gameplay is tense, and the mechanics work fine.  Overall, I found it really interesting and fun, if played knowing that it is a long game.  It has quite a lot of nice details, like the space run, the Defcon level, coups, etc.  It has problem FOR ME, this is absolutely personal.  It has A LOT of information on the board, and I'm not good at getting such amounts of info from the map.  It was quite difficult for me to get the knowledge of who was winning where.
It has some amount of luck, but I do not mind really.

Just couldn't get into it, the game seemed so luck driven which I didn't expect at all.

I found that the cards I drew hurt me far more than my opponent, while his mostly benefitted him.

The scoring cards were almost always in his contol whilst I got Europe at a time he knew I had to have it. This let him score more.

The dice rolling for coups and re education being based on a single dice with minimal modifiers caused massive swings.

Not what I expected and hope to never play again.

Probably the most stressful game in my collection. You're constantly teetering on the verge of failure, and every move you make seems to help your opponent much more than it helps you. Tough decisions galore.

The only downside of the game is that it's quite brutal towards newcomers, with several "gotcha!" cards (f.ex. the DEFCON suicide ones) in the deck that can either end the game immediately or otherwise feel quite unfair. But then again, no-one said anything about the Cold War being fair in the first place.

RATING: 9.7
Truely superb game - looks intimidating at first but fully understood (though certinly not mastered) after just 1 play. Myself and opponent both a little AP prone, so can go as long as 6hrs, though I'm sure more regular folks could easily half that... even at our length though, it's full of tension and hair-pullingly difficult choices throughout.

Responsible for possibly my single best boardgaming experience - a game that went to final scoring and ended with a single point victory for my opponent, after several turns of teetering on the edge of a Europe domination loss. Awesome.

Kept from a perfect 10 purely due to some fiddliness... as bif 2p games go though, it's about as good as it gets.

A superb 2 player game.  A little on the long side at around 3 hours but very little down time makes up for that.  Very easy to pick up rules but takes a lot of plays to master.

Initial Impression: This CDG has a very strong story arc. The learning curve can be fairly brutal for newbies as you really benefit by learning the cards as you play multiple times. Unfortunately, I find both factions are not asymmetrical enough for me. One day I'll set aside some time to properly learn the game through repeated plays.

I've played this a few times and haven't found the fun to balance out the time investment. I have begun to see the replayability and depth of strategy, though I'm far from knowing the cards enough to play it well. I simply haven't had enough fun to continue with the heavy time investment needed to get the maximum out of this game. I did buy the app after it came out and after the above-mentioned plays of the physical board game; I will likely continue to dabble in the digital game while on longer plane rides. Honestly, I've enjoyed my time with the app more than the physical board game (its great for a cross-country flight if I want a long game over a movie). I doubt I will ever sit down with a physical copy of this game again. There are simply too many other games, including other CDGs, I'd rather play.

Update, Sept 2017: after playing a bunch of other CDGs -- some of which I've felt comfortable enough to rate -- my thoughts on this game can be clarified a bit. Again, the fun to time ratio is way off in this game. The game is 2-3 hours of see-sawing, tense, event mitigation that also requires you to recognize an opponent's tell of an upcoming scoring card. The key to this game is knowledge of the entirety of the deck. Clever play of other aspects (e.g., realignments, etc.) is much, much less impactful.  Memorization of a card deck is simply not fun and is an artificial way for the game to inject supposed depth. While other CDGs also incentivize card knowledge, the level at which this game requires card knowledge is comparatively much greater, and that makes this game a CDG that I will rarely play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
After getting familiar with the cards, there's definitely been a strong USSR bias in our house.  We're trying out some of the additional rules suggested in the Deluxe Edition rulebook to address that.  But I still love to play it even despite this flaw: minimal rules offer stunning strategic depth, and the theme is conveyed very well.

RATING: 5
This game is very tightly balanced and interactive, and from that perspective it is a very well designed game. If I was looking for a game based solely on this merit it might even score a 10/10.

Where this game fails for me is (1) the connection between the rules and the theme often seems tenuous at best, and I find it hard to stay engaged in the game as I play (I find the theme itself to be not that great to begin with) and (2) the play time is extremely long for a two player game.  I would expect this kind of play time from a 4 player game, not a 2 player game, and because of the mechanical elements of the game it is not even conducive to socializing.

Basically what I am saying is that I respect the technical aspects of the design via-a-vis a close and interactive balance game, but I just don't enjoy playing it.

Great game.  Card knowledge is important, so having players of different experience can create a rather unbalanced game.  If you can find someone to struggle through a few games to learn it though, this is an excellent competitive game.

I view this much like chess, with the right opponent it's a brilliant game.

There is a TON of luck in the way the cards are distributed, but it's just something that both players have to accept when playing with a shared deck.

Obviously, Twilight Struggle offers plenty of tactics/strategy for gamers who know the decks.

I love the theme of this area influence game. Learning curve is a bit steep for beginners. You really have to know the cards, keep track of the possible scoring cards, and watch what your opponent is doing to do well. By just looking at the board it is not readily apparent where the danger might be. While the game is not terribly complex, it is a bit unintuitive, and I found my first game a bit frustrating as I kept missing scoring rounds (which my opponent drew all but one). I was able to enjoy my second game though. I do not believe this is a wargame!!

As for component quality I have to give GMT credit here, I was satisfied. Sturdy cards, map looks beatiful especially after lamination, thematic dice were a nice touch, and so were the plastic baggies. Player aid cards are useful, and the box is sturdy and colorful, with interesting historical data.

This game is full of tension, which is fun.  There is also a lot of planning to do, and the turns are structured so you never feel like you're waiting.  It's a bit heavy for some.  As someone relatively new to the boardgaming hobby, I frequently forget to do certain things, like advance the action phase chit or place the "no coup or reallignment" chits when defcon is degraded.  This causes annoyance when we realize we messed up the rules.  Until I learn the game better and can keep solid track of these things, the game is a 7.

Obviously it appeals to a wide spread group of people: the thematic gamers, the wargamers (This game is a clear example of a ConSim or Conflict Simulation thematic game), the historical gamer, even the Eurogamer.

Or so it seemed for a few years I was playing this thing with a friend a few times a year...

----

That being said: 

I want to play Conflict of Heroes or HP Lovecraft games or Wing Leader ANY TIME over TS.
The good thing about it though is that I can play it on my Surface 4 now. The AI is now tuned up so much that any casual player will get screwed every time by trics and a 1500 rated AI player.

Probably being the best boardgame EVER, it is too competitive for me. but I can recognise a masterpiece when I see/play one.

3 wins in 20+ games against the AI, which btw still made a programming mistake by keeping a scoring card in hand the last time I won ...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
Played it only twice now, but... damn this game is fun.  The time just melts away when we play as there's virtually no downtime at all for either player once you get started into it.

I've gotten smashed into the ground both games, once by the US and once by the USSR, so from my perspective it seems relatively balanced so far.  :P

I have the second edition, and the components are fantastic for what they are.  Playing with a piece of plexiglass (mine is from a poster frame) is the *only* way to play this game.  I can't imagine even trying to play without one.  I also love how GMT gives you little ziploc baggies to keep all the chits in.  Very useful, that.  I only wish they'd give you something to hold the cards in so that they don't flop around the box, but I store them in bigger ziploc baggies to prevent that, which seems to be working so far.

The rules are exceedingly clear and well written, with plenty of examples.  They are also laid out very well, which makes it easy for quick-checking little rules.

Being a big fan of Command and Conquer: Red Alert games for the PC, I love the theme of this game.  I love how the gameplay feels very evocative of the theme as you play.  

The play time of our games have been pretty short so far  (2 hours for first game, 1.5 hours for second game), and imagine the time will get even shorter once we are even more familiar with all the cards.  Both games ended during the 4th or 5th turn, though, so we've never been close to going the full turn limit.

I hesitate to give this a 9 for now, because, at present, there's only one fellow with whom I can play this, and I'm not sure if anyone else I know would really be interested in taking it for a spin.  Unfortunately, that limits the amount of table time it can have, although we both thoroughly enjoy the game, so I'll try to bust it out as often I can.  :D

Simply put: great game.  Lots of fun.

****UPDATE*****
Finally played a game that went 9 rounds, and it took around 3 hours, which isn't too bad considering play slowed considerably towards the middle as we were trying to learn all the new cards we had available to us.  Like before, the time just melts away and you never notice the hours as they pass.

Every time we finish playing this, all I can think about is wanting to play it again.  That's a sign of a great game, methinks.  As a result, I'm bumping up from 8.5 to 9.  I'm always going over in my head what I did wrong in my prior games so as to improve for the next.  One of these days, maybe I'll even pull out a victory.

****UPDATE****
This game gets more fun every time I play it.  Increased knowledge of the cards by both players results in a superior contest.  Hands down my favorite game.

****UPDATE****
The updated mounted board makes this wonderful game an even bigger pleasure to play.  (No more plexiglass!)  This is still most definitely my favorite game.  I love it to bits.

W/L = 9-8  US/USSR WINS = 11/6

Based on one play. Great game! It will be interesting to see if the game getts better or worse once you start to get familiar with the cards. Update: Played 7 or 8 times. Still impressed! A bit chaotic but a lot of fun! Rating bumped up to 9.

RATING: 5
First play and ran out of time to finish owing to long learning curve and need to cross ref the rules. First impressions, yes the designers certainly researched 20th Century history but a couple of niggles; significant victory points can be gained dependant upon the roll of a single die. Come on guys how clumsy is this? Certainly not worthy of a top 10 game. Secondly, the board is made of very flimsy card stock (not as bad as Hammer of the Scotts but still cheap). This was an expensive game so this element was a disapointment.As time passes I feel no compulsion to play this again and thoughts of the random dice throws really turn me against this. Reduce rating to 5.

Traded.

RATING: 10
Only a few plays under my belt at this time, but my initial rating was higher than an 8 until I played some of the "sharks" in this game. I won't call the rather scripted card deck completely manipulative, but good players clearly are separated from the newcomers in this one, and I just don't see much variety in gameplay from game to game. This is a brilliant design and a great game, but I will need more plays to see the depth I suppose.

(April 2014)
I have had a lot of experience with this game by now. My rating remains an 8. The design is excellent...and I see what it is so popular, even if I don't personally agree with its #1 rating. The game seems to be all about counting cards at a high level of play. 

(July 2014)
OK, OK...upping my rating to a 9. This is one CDG where a player must absolutely, positively know the deck in order to succeed. I am not the world's best "card counter," but knowing which critical cards remain in play is a must. The game does reward one who takes the time to learn to play well - thereafter it has an entirely new feel. This is the sign of a great design and as I can now play competitively (can't say that about all board/wargames), I have to bump my rating up.

(December 2015)
Thanks to the immediate accessability of Vassal live games, my games of this are in the 100s by now. Thus, my upgrade to a rating of "10" is long overdue.

RATING: 10
Beautifully simulates the cold war feel. Constant grief about what the opponent will do to you and how you will respond in kind. Endless options, balanced game play, emersive theme, agonizing decisions and beautiful components (deluxe edition), and the perfect blend of Euro mechanics and war game stratgy  make this one my all time favorite two-player game. 

2015 Update: Still the best. No other game give me the sense of dread or anticipation that this game does. I'm still only playing about 80% of the game as I don't normally use realignment rolls or coups as I don't like to leave things up to chance. I'm sure there is more depth here than I've uncovered in 20+ plays. 

Personal note: my wife Jen gets extremely frustrated with this game. Not her favorite as there is just so much to know (or forget) which can really hamper the experience. I'm finding that she does not like games where one person takes the resources another needs to make their plan work. Worker placement games are all hit and miss as a result.

Another amazing game from Jason Matthews. This game is just dripping with theme. You really do feel like you're battling the USA (I'm always the USSR!) for control of the free world. There is so much going on here but it is really not a difficult game to understand and you won't even realize that you've played a 3 or 4 hour game, it's just that fun. This is a must have for any serious gamer.

This game was a lot of fun - the perfect blend of luck by draw, tactics and strategy for a 2 player game. It reminds me of Eclipse in that the rules / mechanics are quite simple, but incredibly elegant. Game play is smooth and there wasn't any downtime - even if the other player has some AP occurring, usually it is because of some nasty surprise you dumped on them, and now you can revel as they sweat it out. Haha!

The "Fabulous" Deluxe edition is... fabulous. Definitely worth it if you are a fan of the game, or even a newbie. This is such a brilliant design; it changed my "war gaming life" :)

It was amusing to read one reviewer (who disparaged the game) lament that he did not understand how the realignment mechanic made it into the design because it was worthless. Hmmmm... If one's understanding of the game and its tactics is that poor, one has no business reviewing it.

OK, so I actually own the PC version of this, which is the same game but can be played in a shorter time because you have the computer to work out the fiddly bits. If I had the cardboard version, I would sleeve the cards to prevent warping from dripping sweat--this game is intense.

On a very basic level, you're playing a card for Operations Points, which you place in various countries around the world to increase your influence, or you're playing the card for its Effect, which in one way or another also affects the play of Operations Points. Now and then a region of the world is scored and you get points based on your influence there. There's also a space race going on and a constant struggle to control the DEFCON level.

This game has unimaginable depth, depth that can only be appreciated by playing the game a few times (it takes two or three games before you start to get a feel for how it works). Consider the fact that a fan published a 425 page strategy guide. I know, right?

Having played quite a few card driven wargames, it took me a while to get into this one. There are no armies on the map! Once I got over that seemingly obvious issue, I really go into this game.

Awesome strategic replayable two player game if you can find the right person to play with and have 3-4 hours to play the game (which are the two main criticisms against this game - the two players have to be of relatively the same level to have an enjoyable experience and need a fair wedge of time to finish in one play).

Game provides memorable moments more than any other game.  Will have you sitting on the edge of your seat throughout.

A good two-player game about the history of cold war, very educational but quite heavy gameplay. I'm not sure about the replay value of this, in the first games the cards come as a surprise but later you might just remember which cards have gone already and which are still coming and that would change the dynamics a lot... I'm willing to play more but not interested in getting this myself.

Umiddelbart m√•ske lidt for sv√¶rt at variere √•bningsspillet. M√•ske er det blot min manglende erfaring - men starten virker lidt for ensartet. Og s√• ender mine spil altid med pointsejr i l√∏bet af Midwar-fasen.

Tematik og spilmekanik h√¶nger fint sammen. Man har en klar oplevelse af at lede en supermagt i den kolde krig. Og atomkrigs-muligheden g√•r at spillet aldrig er helt tabt, f√∏r det er tabt.

Pocas cosas puedo decir de [url=http://ballearicus.blogspot.com.es/2012/04/twilight-struggle-un-juego-de-2.html]Twilight Struggle[/url] que no haya dicho ya. Estamos ante un enorme juego que indiscutiblemente se convertir√° en un cl√°sico moderno por m√©ritos propios. Seguramente ha habido, hay y habr√° excelentes juegos basados en lo que llamamos m√©canica de ‚Äúmotor de cartas‚Äù. Pero lo que realmente distingue Twilight Struggle es su asombrosa capacidad de ofrecernos un juego accesible sin sacrificar narrativa y riqueza en el detalle. 

Es un juego que puede explicarse en 30 minutos a un novato que quiera echarle ganas, y en 3 o 4 horas que puede durar el juego en sus primeras partidas, vivir 45 a√±os de tensi√≥n, agitaci√≥n y conmoci√≥n mundial. 
Las mec√°nicas son l√≥gicas y est√°n muy simplificadas y aunque a veces puede llegar a pisar el terreno de lo abstracto, nunca como para no sentir la acci√≥n ejecutada. 

El "motor de cartas" no s√≥lo proporciona la sensaci√≥n de jugar a trav√©s de una l√≠nea temporal, sino que crea m√∫ltiples tensiones en la toma de decisiones del cuando y como jugar las cartas como eventos o como puntos de influencia.

Para el que suscribe este es un wargame tem√°tico con tintes euros de peso mediano-alto, dise√±ado para aprender y disfrutar durante muchos a√±os. L√°stima que la edici√≥n en espa√±ol llega tarde para m√≠.

Man do I love this game. It's like walking a tightrope for 3 hours. Every decision seems important in this classic tug of war game. The theme is superbly incorporated by the timeline in which the events from the cards happen. Only problem for me is the time investment to play this 3 to 5 hour monster. This is the reason I hardly seem to get it to the table. But when I do, I'm excited like a little boy before Christmas. And if Christmas only comes once a year, so be it.

RATING: 9.5
I like it.  Maybe a little more than it deserves.  It just seems to be a game that balances epic and orderliness quite well. I don't think epic requires a description, but "orderliness," "orderliness" covers a lot of ground.

Orderliness that borrows from Euro games, satisfying strategy existing without interfering with the enjoyment of the experience.

I'd like to write a longer review and analysis about what I think it does well, what it doesn't, and why I think it deserves the praise it gets, but for now, I'll just say of all the "war-games" I've played it has been the best at balancing playability with the thrill of carrying out grand "military" actions. 

Recently I've played a couple video games that have absolutely ruined their board game equivalents.  "You mean I don't need to hold all this supply line info in my head for the next three hours?"  *head explodes* More power to you if you can and want to, but the thought just makes me tired.  

My point being that I don't see TS being ruined by online/PC/IOS/Android versions.  The joy of playing someone in person is never (rarely?) overshadowed by extraneous (but usually vital) information.  And these days with video games being so cheap and easy, that's a mighty virtue in favor of TS's supremacy in my head-space.

Finally i got the game. A beautiful game, full of tension as during the Cold War, every card played can lead to a change in the balance of world control. A beautiful game board, the cards are perfect to bring the player in the years of the Cold War. The game has simple rules, but that needs a meticulous strategy, because a little carelessness the enemy could conquer the domain of an important region. Is a "must have", for all those who love the strategy at the highest levels.

Believe the hype. Incredible tension. Extremely well thought out game. Played 1960 before this and liked it a lot, but this is definitely the better game. Number one on BGG for a very good reason.

One thing I've really come to appreciate about this game is how it gets better with each play. I'm the kind of guy who is often very impressed with a game initially and then after a few more plays, the initial exitement wears off. This is completely different. The better you and your opponent knows the cards, the better the game becomes. However, this is also a game where an experienced player will crush a newbie, so watch out for that.

Six plays now and TS is holding strong with a 9 rating and a spot in my top 10.  I am definitely getting more familiar.  However, I also seem to be getting a bit sloppy (not reading cards carefully, misplaying my hand) and I seem to be showing more AP, especially in the mid-war when I feel like the board is locked up.  One thing I've learned for sure is to not give up on a game.

In my 6th game (USSR), my opponent's 50th (USA), I got off to a great start but moved into Pakistan too early.  He couped (6) to flip Pakistan and my huge turn 1 advantage ended up not as huge.  For the most part, the cards really went my way this game but the dice did not.  I missed many key rolls and my opponent hit the biggest ones for him.  It was the first game of TS where I saw the dice so lopsided.  Still, my opponent outplayed me with the cards significantly.  Still learning.

I feel like the theme is well integrated with the game play.  It's been fun to watch an experienced player maneuver through some dicey situations while I struggled.

I feel like I say this a lot after finally playing highly rated games, but I really shouldn't have waited so long to play this one.

RATING: 4
In principle, the luck of the card draw and die rolls evens out over the course of the game.  However, Russia's first turn coup of Italy has a PRODIGIOUS effect on the game, since it basically determines who will dominate Europe.  The difference between rolling a 1 and rolling a 6 on that first play can decide who will win -- two and a half hours later.

If it weren't for that, I'd love this game.  It's a phenomenal design, tense, and very fun to play. However, there is simply no occasion in which, having a single opponent, I wouldn't rather play Through the Ages.

Twilight Struggle is a deep two-player area influence game that reeks with tension and seems to have infinite playability.

As a two-player influence game Twilight Struggle brilliantly avoids the "one for one" pitfalls inherent in the genre (see 1960 for a game that falls face first into this problem). The card driven system is an excellent way to keep the game thematic and fresh from turn to turn, and the cards here are neither overtly chaotic nor overwhelming in scope (like the cards in your typical Fantasy Flight game). A few are clearly underpowered but most provide the right level of "one-of" effects to add great character and interactions to the game.

Twilight Struggle thrives on immediacy and angst. The quasi-random nature of the scoring cards isn't without flaws but keeps you on your toes with every card play. You're constantly forced to respond and push on the board, because the moment you don't is the moment an unfavorable scoring card will hit. There's a good sense of interaction in this, and plenty of room for bluffing and momentum. Pulling you in the other direction is having to deal with a fistful of cards that hurt you. It's the perfect shake-up factor as your freedom to place influence on the map comes directly at odds with trying to mitigate the cards in your hand. Tension and decision-making is in no short supply here. There's no doubt that Twilight Struggle is much more tactical than it is strategic. It thrives on its back and forth nature much more so than any long term planning. It's also a very calculated game where almost every decision is crucial. You just don't feel like you're making fake decisions in this one.

There are two common complaints with Twilight Struggle: randomness and imbalance. There are many, many points of randomness in Twilight Struggle. In fact, there are so many that they tend to even out over the length of a single game. That‚Äôs a good thing. With die rolls in particular it is quite clever that you are usually accomplishing something regardless of the roll, be it pitching a bad card, gaining military operations or dropping DefCon, although it‚Äôs obviously better to roll well than to not. Honestly, considering the thousands of utterly crucial decisions a player has to make in a typical game of Twilight Struggle I am skeptical of blaming losses on bad luck. What bad luck can do is make the path to victory much more unforgiving and challenging. Rarely will it outright hand you a loss.

I don't believe the game is perfectly balanced for all skill levels. Twilight Struggle clearly has a learning curve, much steeper than your typical Euro but much shallower than your typical wargame. As an experienced player it's easy to see where the uninitiated see too many die rolls or don't understand facts like coups drive the game but realignments are merely an advanced tactic. It's also undeniable that the US is tougher to play on account of being less forgiving in the early game. Even between skilled players it is unfortunately possible to draw certain hands in the early game that will lead to an unavoidable USA collapse. The big culprits are Red Scare and how the early scoring cards come up (in particular which double dip on turn 3). The Chinese Civil War variant tends to stabilize the early turns significantly, or spotting some influence to the US works as well, but bad deals can still occur. Still, in the long run the better player almost always wins and that‚Äôs really the important thing. I do consider myself to be a fairly skilled Twilight Struggle player, so understand my biases.

In any event, Twilight Struggle is an amazing game. Every decision is tense and every game plays out differently. It has a great sense of theme. The 2-3 hour playing time is reasonable for a game of this depth. There are great online implementations (wargameroom) that make it even faster and easier to play. In this age of Euros it is rare for a game to last through even a dozen plays, but after over one hundred plays Twilight Struggle is still holding my interest. That's an amazing accomplishment, and something I can't say of any other game really (shy of something like collectable like Magic or short like Dominion). Twilight Struggle truly is a modern masterpiece, and it falls just a few small tweaks away from gaming perfection. I‚Äôll be playing this game forever.

Pro's:

1) Thematically deep and rich, evoking the feel of the cold war very well.
2) Asymmetrical but well balanced. Playing each side feels unique, often it can feel like your opponent has the upper hand, but when playing the other side and being put into the same position there is a consistent element that you cannot win and that everything is hopeless.
3) The space race release valve, the military operations and defcon tracks are designed in a way that makes it very tense to use them correctly.
4) Learning the game as two new players.

Con's:

1) Does massively favour an experienced player, while this is common in many board games, it feels more punishing here.

A game with a great atmosphere.

For me, the thing that breaks the game is the great amount of luck involved.  If you get lousy cards and especially if this happens a few turns, you really can't do much to straighten the game.  Next to the luck of cards, you also have the luck of dice.

Very good game, and my wife's favorite heavy game.  Who'd have thought the Cold War could be fun?  I agree with critics who say that some cards are too repetitive:  e.g. we always know Castro will be in Cuba.

The components are perfectly acceptable -- I say that as a grognard from the 70s -- but it would have been nice if there were a little more substance.  The card stock is fine.

RATING: 6.5
So I have played a few games F2F and on the app now, won a couple of times as both sides. What have I learned? In terms of the area majority part of the game, which I like, I have learned which areas and especially which territories are most important, the latter largely because of the cards associated. Knowing the risks around France, Bulgaria, W Germany, Cuba, Egypt/Israel, the Koreas and Thailand, amongst others, is a huge part of the game. However, aside from this 'learn the cards piece', I have discovered nothing in the area control mechanism which wasn't readily apparent at first play. 

In terms of the 'gotchas', the game is clearly designed to give you countless ways to generate an 'auto-lose' situation by lacing the deck with many events you simply can not risk playing at Defcon 2 (or even Defcon 3 at Headline). Some of these are obvious to the first timer, some less so and all require active hand management so you are not forced to play them. I have seen this mechanism before in several fillers and it works well there, but I really don't like it in a game you are investing several hours in. There is nothing worse than wining or losing that length of game on a silly mistake.

I am also not a big fan of the dice. Dice in a wargame? Yes, they introduce thematic randomness but get rolled a lot so any luck tends to even out over the course of a game. The dice in TS are too crucial and rolled too few times for the weight of game.

So, conclusions. Is it a decent game? Yes. Does it have depth? No, it has a requirement to learn the cards if you want to play well, but that is not the same thing. Strengths: it is undoubtedly one of the most tense games you can play. Weaknesses: randomness and overwhelming punishment of mistakes might make for tension, might be thematic but they don't make a great game for me.

Weren‚Äôt it a two-player only game, I wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to regard Twilight Struggle not only as my favorite game but also as the the best game ever made: sadly though it‚Äôs quite too demanding for a two-player game, since you need a very motivated opponent and quite a few hours to spend over one game only.

As such, it‚Äôs unquestionable Twilight Struggle is a great game - one of the best around - but I can't place it at  the top of my personal tastes. [i](March 2013)[/i]

I *love* this game. It's a war game (a genre I normally don't like) masquerading as straight area control (one of my top two favorite genres). This is the only game I've played that's actually stressful--really simulates the period well! So far, the US has won every time I've played, though the last time it wasn't a blow-out like the first two games.

Update: My fourth play was the first one that lasted all 10 turns--took just over 6 hours--and the Soviets won with a score of 12.

I have owned the previous versions of Twilight Struggle, and enjoyed playing other peoples' copies, but I had traded and sold the other editions because even though it was a great game, the paper map of the original coupled with cheap looking graphics just didn't grab me compared to some of the amazing looks of other games I owned like Fury of Dracula, War of the Ring, etc. The second edition with its cardstock board was an improvement, but again, board gamers compare games to the best ones they own, and GMT just wasn't trying hard enough in such a competitive marketplace to put out a solid build for such a unique and quality game. But finally I took a chance on the new, 2009 edition of the game, and wow, what can I say. This is probably one of the best made and best looking games I own, not to mention being one of the highest rated games available. The board is just awesome. Thick card stock, mounted linen paper, great graphics, full color rule book, more cards, just everything you would want to play. I'm so impressed with the new version. It was high time GMT applied the same high quality production values of "Winds of Plunder," a game that came and went so fast you've probably never heard of it, to one of the best 2-player card-driven wargames ever designed. I'm just really glad to have this fine, sturdy copy of such an excellent product.

Wow does this game bring out my analysis-paralysis.  There are so many options, so many things you want to do and ways to do it.

It really is a struggle.

RATING: 8.2
One of the most finely-balanced and elegant games I have ever played. Captures the feeling of Cold War brinksmanship perfectly. Game play is at times excruciatingly tight (in the best way possible). I normally shy away from long (~3 hour) games and 'card-driven' wargames but this one might make me reconsider. Deluxe version has sumptuous components, though a counter tray is needed.

EDIT: Just finally had my first US win. What a game! I am constantly amazed by how tight this game is, and I think I'm starting to learn how to control DEFCON to rule out Coups and realignments - it's such a vital part of the game.

I'm loving how EVERYTHING has dual uses - even the China card can be used for good points or to allow you to keep back an extra card. So perfectly balanced!

EDIT2: I haven't played this for months, and have turned down games in favour of other games. That is indicative of something - perhaps not game quality, but in order for this rating scale to make sense I need to apply it consistently, so I'm downgrading its rating. This might change.

There's a reason this made it to number one. Incredibly tense gameplay with a careful balancing act to not help your opponent (or tip your plans) with every move you make.

My only "10" I've rated to date. I love this game. Really thematic, really tense. The games progression from Early, Middle and Late war is done really well. There are aspects of luck, (dice rolls and card draws) but much of the games difficulty comes from trying to minimize the damage from bad cards/dice rolls. The hidden scoring cards lead to some really interesting games of cat and mouse.

Initial thoughts: This game did an amazing job of capturing the theme. We both felt soooo stressed out and tense during and after this game. However, it doesn't work very well for us since it is a head to head confrontational battle. No complaints about the game design though. Very cool.

Update: Bumping this up to a 9 after a few more plays. Really awesome game that makes me want to play more. Super deep, so thematic, and tense. Easy to see why it is so high in the rankings on BGG.

Update 2: Alright it's a 10, there's just no way around it. Amazing game that just gets better with more plays. Probably the best game I've ever played.

// This is a fun game, but a little too reliant on dice
rolling as a mechanic. I can deal with the frustration of 
getting a bad hand during a given turn, because typically
there are still valid options, but failing something due to
 a bad roll is just not fun gameplay. (At the same time, at
 least the opponent has the same odds, so it's balanced in

This game is probably the most tense in my collection. Every card-play is a nail biter, with the threat of total defeat always hanging over you. Nothing is certain here.

Very good but maybe a little too hard. It's difficult in your first game to do the things well against experienced players. I get blasted by the USSR at the beggining of the late war.

*update* 

After the second play, commited some mistakes in the rules but better experience. Improved to a 9. Very good game.

*update*

After a game with two hands in which I got 3 and 2 scoring cards respectively I felt like this game needs some rules change to avoid that situations because I found myself with 5 actions less than my opponent in only 3 turns. I was so asphyxiate that I even had to skip the space race in one turn to survive my disastorous hand. A game of 3 hours long with this issue can't be a top of all times.

This one is an epic game. You play as one of a great superpower (USA or USSR) in the cold war period. Your goal is to gain influence in countries around the world to gain control over the regions. That‚Äôs basically it. The rules are quite simple and you can get a hold of it quite fast. But game is not easy at all. The decision making is a key here thanks to great card-driven mechanic. In every turn you have to play a card either using its influence value or event it describes. But in the common deck there are cards with both USA and USSR player events (plus some neutral) and you will get both types on your hand. The trick is that if you play opponents card as an influence value you will also have to play its event. And that‚Äôs perfect! It makes this game an optimization of losses. You want to play opponents cards in the least favorable conditions mitigating the damage it will do.
There are also very important scoring cards that give you points for corresponding regions. Drawing one is a good and bad thing. It holds a spot for card in your hand but gives you knowledge on where the scoring will be this round (because if you have one of those in your hand you have to play it). So you can prepare for it, but your opponent will be watching your every move trying to guess where your focus lies. 
There is a constant race for control over the regions. You want to stay one step ahead of your opponent also negating every threat that he is creating. This makes this game extremely intense. Additionally, the cards events are the real events from that period and it all makes me really invested in playing. I can feel the tension and atmosphere of the high war council. I love playing it!
That being said it's not a perfect game. For me the theme and feeling of this game adds very much and without it it wouldn't be such a fun.
There are dice included and when performing some actions, you have to roll. And it adds randomness. You can most of the time tilt the odds in your favor some way but either way in the most crucial moment even when the statistics are favoring you the coup might fail and in a tight game it can be devastating. It also adds some flavor to the game but can be frustrating.
Worst thing for me is that on some turns you can end up drawing only opponent‚Äôs cards while he could draw "normal" hand. Then the whole round you will just try to mitigate damage while your opponent will gradually gain superiority. If this happen it can change the game and could be difficult to reverse.
For a long time, this one was number one game on BGG. I don‚Äôt think it necessarily is the greatest game ever but for me it surly is better than today‚Äôs top 3 (Pandemic Legacy: Season 1, Through the Ages, Gloomhaven). Now games make top 10 based on hype, in the days TS was #1 they made it because of value (and this is nicely indicated with number of votes ‚Äì TS have nearly 30k votes and has now rank 4 while Gloomhaven has 5k votes and rank 3).

Awesome game system. Too bad it's a little unbalanced. Very tense, very reactive ("I don't know what he's really after, but I'll try to stop him, whatever it is"). Has a strong luck factor, but the card draw makes every match unique (considering that the events make a few of the locations on the map a bit scripted)

Even with its flaws (not completely balanced, luck factor in a hard and long game) this is still amazing. This game is just more impressive than anything else I've ever played. This game's design is so amazing that it feels like a work of art.

I so wanted to love this game and was very anxious to get my first game played... it took us three sessions to finish our first game (total of 9 hours playing time) and this was the most awesome gaming experience i have ever had... wake me up at 3am and i will be ready to play this game... looking forward to get some more games under my belt.

Outstanding card driven political war game simulating possible avenues that the Cold War may have taken, interspersed with real events (on cards) that direct game play. The classic.

Like this game a lot. Only played once though and didn't even finish that game after 3 hours of play. There is a learning curve on the rules but had it down after an hour or so. Then it was learning what to do when that made the game hard. Knowing the cards better would help, especially what cards might come up when and trying to  plan for that. I love the hard choices that once has to make in the game. Thousand things you want to do and only three that you can. Good, tense stuff. Components are nice, even the board which gets way too much negative attention. It's just fine how it is. I'm more than willing to play again any time.

And yes, played my first game with David. I learned enough in my defeat as the USSR to get over some of the confusion I was having with the Steam version. I'll definitely be playing again.

I have only played TS face to face the once -  4 of us played 2 games in parallel, all playing for the first time, all seemed to enjoy it. I've also played this by email, using VASSAL. That works very well. Some Vassal games have to be "FTF", this one does not. Email gives you the pondering time you need, which is great.

I've just got to learn more about this one! It's a very strategic CDC game with a number of clever mechanics which bring a lot to it. Knowledge of all the cards is key as you have to try to work out what your opponent is holding based on what he's doing on the board at the time.

I've always said that I am not a wargamer, but this game really appeals to me.  Too bad it is only 2 player and takes a reasonably long time to play...  I like how the designers have balanced the advantages from the card events, and leave it up to the player's to manipulate those events to occur (or be hidden) at the best time for them.  I really like this system.  Plus the multiple scoring regions allows for players to shift their focus and try to take advantage of unused regions.  I really am excited about this game!

This is an incredible game. I'll admit that I haven't nearly begun to play this on the level it should be played - with a good knowledge of the cards so I can anticipate what is coming. Still, I can recognize that every moment is tense; every decision is just agonizing. The varied large and small mechanics of the game match the theme of the game so well; as others have said, I can't imagine another theme attached to them. It doesn't invite you in for you to be immersed, it throws you in and you don't emerge until the end of the game. There are very few games on this level.

I love the CDG wargame format, and Twilight Struggle is one of the best.  While it's more of an influence placing game than a wargame, the depth of strategy and replayabilty has drawn in a lot of wargamers in who wouldn't be normally be playing something quite so simple in mechanics.  And it appeals to people on the Euro side of the fence too!

A complex ruleset, but rather straight-forward gameplay. I played the US and won by forcing a draw in Asia and blocking access of the UDSSR to Africa midgame. The game was very strategic/tactical and overall exciting. The board is well designed and it's very easy to get an overview about the board state.

Cons:
 - The Art
 - The first play feels random, because you don't know the events. This makes playing against a newb completely unfair. Forgetting a critical event may also be very punishing.

Played once, and that may not be enough to really appreciate it, but I don't see why this is number one on the Geek.  Other games that I don't care for that have been that highly rated made some sense, but this one just doesn't seem like the kind of game that would rise so high.

I'm willing to play again.  I think the game was alright.  I think with a better shuffle it could have been better.

Just acquired at reasonable price. I am a big fan of CDGs and this one is so highly rated I couldn't resist. Not everyone is a big fan I see, so I hope to find out for myself soon. Rating (8) is tentative...
++++++
Finally got to play and it didn't disappoint. Quite the opposite in fact! As a retired "Cold Warrior" I was afraid it might turn out to be too much of a "bus-man's holiday" - but not so. The tweaks to the venerable CDG engine make this one of the most tension filled games of cat and mouse I've encountered in a long time. Despite the fact that you aren't moving leaders/units about the map this is very much a war game. And a game with one of the best ever implementations of a theme - right up there with "Dune" and "War of the Ring." This game showcases what can be done with the card-driven engine when firing on all twelve cylinders. Rating going up based on just one play. If this has the legs I think it may have, my rating will go up even further.
++++++
Well, for some reason this game is not getting the replay I imagined (likely because it's a two-player and my sessions usually involve more than two). Could also be the playing time is just a little too long for this type of game. I'm finding other CDGs (Hannibal, Washington's War, Wilderness War) are more likely to see play. It's a very good game no mistake but hasn't lit that "must play again" fire like some others. I'm not sure I agree that it should be rated the best war-game or the best board game overall. Maybe among the best as a war game (since it is two-player) but best overall? Rating fixed at 8.5 (good but not great)...

Great card driven game, and it seems to hold up to repeat plays. Definitely has a learning curve, and some people will be put off with the 'luck' involved - you can get an awful hand, you can get poor die rolls etc - but it all seems to work, one of the things I like about the game is trying to work out the best way to play your bad hands.

I like this game, however way too much luck involved in my opinion for a CDG. If you don't have right cards or fail on coups, etc and opponent has no issues (especially when they're Russia) game can be over. I understand that there's always chance for someone to come back and win it, but I think (and most will agree) the game is ultimately won majority of the time in the first few rounds. However, still like to play it at times online (Steam).

I finally got a chance to play this and I now get the hype around this game.  It is a fantastic and immersing experience.

A lot has been talked about the mechanics, so I'll go a different route.  What I really enjoyed was the majesty around seeing the events of the latter half of the 20th century unfold as the game is played.  In fact, this would be a great game for a high school World history class - it sure got me interested and understanding some of the key historical events of this time period.

So kids - play this the day before you take your AP World History exam!

Finally got in my first play. It lived up to the hype for sure.  I really enjoy 1960: The Making of the President and this is the same box of excellent card mechanic integration but on a grander scale.  We had to the call the game after 7 (of 10) rounds and 5 hours, but as a learning game, I think it's reasonable to get it under 4 with a couple plays. I can't wait for my next full session.  Inspired design.

This is my second favorite game.  It is a CDW game thats plays out over 40 years of the US,USSR cold war.  

It is well produced however not exactly perfect.  What I would improve is simple board design edits to make "battleground countries" stand out and leap off the board.  

The game is intense.  Each time I play it becomes easier(you know the cards... the rules better...), and harder(you recognize subtle nuiances...) I like playing the Soviet side as I feel the third stage is less kind.  This game usually requires 2-3 hours and continues to teach me the history that very much still currently affects us day to day.

This game is different than any other- in the sense that it is all about mitigating bad situations for yourself in a way that can perfectly balance your position in the various areas of the world map against your opponent.  

When you finish you feel the feelings that the cold war gave a lot of us.  For me each game hangs with me afterwords a few days thinking of how I could have played it differently.

I put off playing this one for a while.  Boy, am I glad I gave it a shot.  On one hand, you have cards that support replicating history.  On the other, to win you must change it.  It's a 3-5 hour game that feels like 1-2.  Considering how lukewarm I was to 1960 and Campaign Manager, I am shocked.

Bah, It's a wargame minus the war. Where's the fun in that? It's like a cross between any number of wargames and El Grande, but sadly not near as interesting as either of those.
I do like that it's pretty simple, executes the theme well, perfect depth, and it plays quickly, but it's still not that fun.

edit: I finally see why people like this so much. It has the card play of fare such as Paths of Glory but without the "complexity" of said title. That being said, I love the way the cards work in games like TS and PoG, but in games like PoG (in the end) it propels combat (which is cool). Whereas in TS it propels placing influence (which is lame). I'd much rather attack the enemy than sway the populace's mindset.

edit: I'm pretty sure a big reason I don't care for this game is that the rules weren't explained to me very well. Because of that, I'd like to give it another shot after learning it properly.

Also, this is NOT a wargame!

edit: Despite the fairly abstract rules, this game simulates the Cold War really well.

10x10 2015.  Just light enough to be accessible to non-wargamers like myself.  There's a great push and pull to control countries on the board.  The card play for events and ops points presents interesting decisions, especially in the order to play your cards.  And once you've played it a number of times you can start to guess what your opponent might have.  Definitely takes a couple plays to get to know all the cards.  Absolutely fantastic theme that is integrated perfectly.  Deserves its high rating.

No he llegado a jugar una partida completa, pero lo suficiente para darme cuenta de que es un buen juego. Trata sobre el tema de la guerra fr√≠a entre USA y URSS despu√©s de la segunda guerra mundial. El juego se desarrolla a trav√©s de un motor de cartas. La partida se divide en tres fases: guerra temprana, guerra media y guerra tard√≠a (o algo as√≠). Hay varias formas de ganar el juego: Consiguiendo 20 puntos, haciendo que el otro jugador provoque una guerra nuclear, o ganando la carrera espacial. Los que entienden y tienen experiencia dice que el juego est√° un poco desiquilibrado a favor de la URSS, pero carezco de la experiencia suficiente para dar mi opini√≥n al respecto. Es entretenido y tiene bastante estrategia. Conviene conocer las cartas del juego. Creo que es muy buen juego, pero que se disfruta m√°s cuando tienes m√°s experiencia.

Just played it for the first time, and lost badly as the US player.  Cards were not cooperative for most rounds, but I made many mistakes through inattention and inexperience.

This is clearly a well designed game, but it crashed and burned at our table.

Everything that I've read about this game is true.  Good game, holds one attention the entire time, the entire three hours.  But that's the main reason that I bump it down from an 8 to a 6 the time requirements.  The other reason is that half of the time I have no feedback as to whether my play is good or not.

The greatest board game I have ever played. I don't think any other game has ever done so good a job of capturing its theme as this one. The game mechanics perfectly translate the rivalry, tension, and absurdity of the Cold War. You will constantly feel as if you are trying to manage a crisis and not quite succeeding. It's awesome.
 
The game is quite strategically rich, too. People are still discovering new styles--there's a robust debate about the merits of playing for board position vs. the merits of grabbing quick VP at every opportunity. You've got an interesting decision to make almost every single round of the game. Playing as the USA and USSR are entirely different experiences, which adds to the game's replayability.

There's almost no snowball effect at all, because players receive a random and completely new hand of cards every round. There is nothing that makes the player in a better position on the board likelier to receive a better hand. Even games that seem lopsided can rapidly swing the other way if the leading player draws a really terrible hand. There are occasional games in which one side draws far better hands all game long and coasts to victory, but more often it evens out.

Note that the game is a bit unbalanced in favor of the USSR player. This can be easily rectified by providing the US player 2 extra starting influence.

As an added little bonus, you'll probably learn some history from playing this game. I certainly did.

One downside is that this game is for two players only. Teaching it to a new player, moreover, is not always a pleasant experience, as any player who has decent card knowledge and understands the basics of strategy will simply crush a beginner. The luck element is nowhere near strong enough to give the new player a chance, and it will likely take quite a few plays before he or she is competitive.

But when two veterans of the game square off, I would say there's no better experience in all of boardgaming.


UPDATE: I will still give this a 10 rating, because I stand by my original assessment that Twilight Struggle is a miracle of game design. Nonetheless, recently I've been finding highly antagonistic games like this one less and less to my taste. I would rather work with other people than try to make them miserable. I am having the most fun either with cooperative games or with competitive games that have a relaxed and friendly atmosphere (think Caverna or Sushi Go). So Twilight Struggle is not seeing much play for me lately. Still, if you want a game where you can test your mettle against an opponent, you can't do better.

Have played this a few times and have progressively liked it the more I have played. Still though, it seems you can really only enjoy it once you know all the cards; what your opponent might have, and what's coming up. By virtue of that alone I don't think the game is as great as the scores here on BGG, but maybe I will come around as I play more.

A really good game. Many great concepts like the moon race or the DEFCON track. Sometimes it seems a little too abstract, just placing numbers doesn¬¥t really feel like the Cold War. I¬¥d love to see the later deck more often. This game favours the experienced player a lot! If you know the cards and the basic flow of the game while your opponent doesn¬¥t, you¬¥ll probably always win, wich makes it pretty frustrating for the other guy.
Still, betwwen too fairly even opponents, this game is a fascinating struggle!

Brilliantly designed area-control/CDG mechanic for a fascinating period of modern history.  It epitomizes the realist school of political thought with its zero-sum game play.  There is cause for concern due to lack of balance (so start US with 2vps) and card effects that are not historically accurate.

You will really need the right person to play this with.  I.e., someone as interested as you, and with the same desire as you to learn this game.  ----my experience

Deluxe edition. I am not really into this period of history, but playing this game feels like being between the sword and the wall. I love it and will play it anytime anywhere!
----------------------
After several plays (including multiple unrecorded online ones), opponents' events seem easier to control. Knowing the deck does not detract from the fun. On the contrary, games are much more enjoyable when both players know what they are doing. My favorite 2-player game at the moment.
----------------------

DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!  

Okay, I love command and conquer strategy games. Axis and Allies, Samurai Swords (now called something else), RISK, Stratego, you name it... and that's what I was hoping for with this.

I will give them kudos for trying to create a game that offers more complicated possibilities to players like coups attempts and technological advancement. 

However, this game is quite simply a History Lesson.  There is barely and actual strategy.  Twilight Struggle's game play is dictated mostly by "events" that take place on a large number of cards that reveal themselves throughout certain eras in the Cold War.  The "events" are seriously in the favor of the US (as is the starting position of all the game pieces - which would be fine by me, normally) and one is not allowed to gain the upper hand on their opponent in any creative way by doing something unexpected OR, better yet, taking the lessons of History and no not repeating the mistakes both the USSR and the US made during the Cold War.

Instead, quite depressingly, one is forced to play out events exactly as they happened in the Cold War leaving no room to make decisions that are your own.

Axis and Allies is still the best war game I've ever played and NO, I don't work for whomever the hell made it.

Great game. Lots of tense decisions. I think that to be good at it you need to really, really know the cards, which is not my cup of tea. However, I do enjoy playing it nevertheless. 

UPDATE: Played it some more and I have grown to appreciate it more than I initially did. It is true that knowing the cards is an important aspect of good play. However, I have come to accept that aspect of the design, especially since my growing experience with CDGs has revealed that this is true for all of them. I think it is fundamentally true for TS though, if that makes any sense at all. First and foremost, I enjoyed playing it, which gains high marks from me.

Fantastic 2 player card-based game.  A struggle.  At twilight.  Well, unless you play in the morning...

Upon further plays, I am starting to see that this game is fairly brilliant in its balance and the different strategies that can be taken with cards. 

My only reservation is that it does appear that this game is open to intense study, so that "opening strategies", etc could become very important against experienced players.  I'm not a huge fan of games that can be analyzed to death and certain scripted-actions memorized for different parts of a game.

Jan 2011:  On further plays, the game is growing on me even more.  I'm starting to appreciate the different strategies in playing or discarding enemy events, and the luck involved in coups makes more sense to me now.  Upped to a 9.

Dec 2011:  It's becoming apparent that the rules are complicated enough that it takes an almost rules reread if I take a few months off between plays.  So, this is n't going to get to the table very often.  Back to an 8.  Just too slightly rules heavy for my taste.

One play and I'm already hooked.  An amazing game which manages to bring alive all the tensions of the Cold War.  I was on the edge of my seat from Turn 1.

The rules were a lot simpler to get than I expected too; after the first turn, we found it very easy, and rarely had to check the rules.  Obviously, though, familiarity with the cards is going to improve play dramatically.

Update: the more I play, the more I love it.  I may have to upgrade to the higher quality version, though, as the one downside is the flimsy, refuses-to-lie-flat map.  If I do, it'll be worth it.  Awesome game.

Only played twice, but I'm definitely convinced of the game's merits. The CDG elements are well utilized, the theme is deeply integrated into all aspects of the gameplay, the decisions about which negative events to play are deeply (and satisfyingly) stressful, and the network-building elements (which are lacking in 1960) provide a sense of gradual expansion. Great!

Me encanta la tensi√≥n continua de intentar controlar todos los frentes, las puntuaciones, las cartas que han salido y las cartas por salir, adivinar los planes del rival, tengo que defender este PAIS CONFLICTIVO y ojo con el GOLPE DE ESTADO que me van a dar en IRAN en cuanto me descuide.

With only 2 plays under my belt, I have to say that this game is MUCH better than 1960.  While it is slightly longer, I find the decisions much more interesting, and overall the system is much more streamlined than 1960.  At the very least, the map is vital to good play (unlike 1960) and the options for spending OPs are MUCH more exciting - how can buying media access compare with a coup attempt?  This thing is dripping with theme, and the play and theme are locked together in a death-grip of gaming goodness.  I don't know why I waited so long on this one (ok, yes I do... I wanted a mounted board) but this is indeed one of the pinnacles of 2 player gaming.  Can't wait to play this one over and over.

OK, OK, the game is awesome. I was uninterested for a long time because I hate war games and tend to have very little in common with people who play them. But I was proven wrong: this is a great game.

The game is not fun, however. At all. It is utter misery, and four hours of it at that. Luckily it is challenging, stressful, and so nail-bitingly intense that I still like to play‚Äîoccasionally. Every card has both a positive and a negative effect upon you, so nothing you do is fully satisfying or enjoyable. This makes the game extremely tense, and really reproduces the "feel" of the Cold War in a palpable way. It runs about an hour too long for my taste, but I still think it's a great game.

RATING: 6
I love the way the board and the box art looks, hated the actual stock of the board, the cards, the typos and the errata.
 
I found it pretty light, easy to understand and fun to play.. for me it doesn't feel like a heavy game, more like a medium weight.  I think I have some serious problems with the game concerning the card combos that can suddenly end the game, and which you really have no control over without perfect knowledge of the deck and discards.. and even then, the most you could lower it to would be 1 out of 7 that I automatically lose in the eighth turn (for example).  The theme hits me in the right place, and I didn't mind the die rolls too much and I don't have any issue with the combat system as a whole.
 
Despite (and because of) some fundamental flaws, and dependant on if the playtime goes down (which goes a long way towards me accepting the insta-combo death situations), I give it a 5.  There's just too many flaws here, and I was blinded by the engaging theme (as I assume the majority of other people are).

RATING: 7
This really is a great game, but it's draining for me to play. I only have a couple of plays under my belt now, but trying to remember all of the modifiers and tokens at the right time was pretty challenging. I imagine with repeated plays and increased familiarity with the cards it would become considerably less burdensome. Its a fun and very challenging game, but I wouldn't want to play it more than say, once every few months. So I'm rating this an 8 based on the depth and great design, but it doesn't quite meet the 8-rating description of "I will never turn down a game."

09/06/11: Knocking this down to a 7. It's been completely replaced by Labyrinth to fill my CDG needs.

This game requires the following:
2-3 hours to learn the basic rules
2-3 hours to play
1 partner willing to spend the time above
3-5 plays before you can actually begin to anticipate the cards well enough to plan around what is in the deck, not just what is in your hand

I'm sure it would be great if you invested that time and energy into the game, but i am not willing to do it.

This is the only game I have ever played where I felt smarter after the game was over.  Years of high school and college history on the Cold War, and this board game was able to offer me immediate and meaningful insight into this era of world history.  The fact that it's a wonderful and fun game almost pales next to its value as a teaching/learning tool.  Everyone should play this at least once.

I have a few card-driven wargames around the house, including We the People, but had never played one until I tried Twilight Struggle.  What was I waiting for?  This was a truly great game, and I thought so even as the Americans, through unfortunate card play, ended up having 7 turns to my FOUR on the fourth turn.  Terrific, terrific game.

RATING: 9
Easy to understand, very difficult to master.  I've played four games and they were all stunningly different.  This game is very hard on poor play, and you can find yourself dead if you make a major mistake.  

Bumped up to a 9 after further reflection.  The thing that I enjoy most about the game is that it rewards the doctrine of containment...i.e., your best strategy (particularly as the U.S. player) is to halt the Soviet advance, not reverse it entirely.  And it is possible to do this, though the Soviet player has cards that will let him break through.

I've enjoyed the times I've played so far, and the time has seemed to fly by. Even though it's driven by cards, and the hands dealt are random, it seems historically pretty accurate, at least on the surface. In my games to date, the Soviets tend to do well in the early turns, only to be overtaken by the Americans in latter stages of the game. As such, a good strategy for the Soviets might be to try for a quick win, either by manipulating DefCon, going for control of Europe, or trying to score several times in a row.

I can see why this game is rated #1 overall, but many of the decisions in the game don't register with me as fun or enjoyable.  The card management aspect of the game, while ingenious for creating a tight, tense experience, just didn't work for me, for whatever reason.

UPDATE (7/29): This online board is amazing: http://twistrug.jjt.io/#/
Perhaps combine with first page of this travel board: http://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/16990/tstravelboard-v1pdf

This game hurts my head. My fiancee and I learned this together. Our ignorance of the cards hurt us a lot. Afterward, she said, "Intriguing, but not fun yet." I agree. UPDATE: I really, really want to play this game again. But I do think it will require several "learning" games where we get surprised by cards the first time around, before learning to plan for them in future games.

For the next game, remember JohnRayJr's advice: I think it's worth explaining the relative frequency of the different kinds of operations: you place influence all the time, do coups once or twice a turn, and do realignments just a few times a game.

The release of the iOS version of this has largely vindicated those of us who complained that the play balance on this is insanely pro-Soviet. Looking at people's win-loss stats as each side reveals a level of imbalance that is totally nuts, and yet which fans of the game largely continue to deny. You'll need to use all the pro-US variants available to make this work (the variant cards alone are definitely helpful but insufficient).

I thought the much faster play of the iOS version might help me get into the game, but actually it just reminded me how much I hate it. If it was only 6 turns, it might be tolerable, but at the length it is I am always bored out of my skull well before the end, when it becomes pretty obvious whose going to win but you've got another hour plus to go.

Another reason to dislike Twilight Struggle ... the narrative here is driven entirely by US right-wing fantasy. The rulebook sort of acknowledges as much, but the degree to which the game takes the many disastrous views of American hard right war hawks and makes it look mainstream is distressing. When you look at it with some discernment, this is not the Cold War, it's not even most Americans' experience of the Cold War. It's what the US political right wished the Cold War had been.
---
Well, I think at least I've finally figured out the obvious reason why Twilight Struggle has such appeal; it's right on the seam between eurogames and wargames. So wargamers who want something euro-ish but just aren't going to play Beowulf can play and enjoy this. Likewise eurogamers who just aren't going to play Battle Above the Clouds, say, can find this one accessible and interesting. But for anyone who appreciates both sides of the gaming spectrum, who can get a kick out of both Blue Moon or Pandemic *and* Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage or Breakout: Normandy, Twilight Struggle really just doesn't have anything to offer.
---
UPDATE: OK, time to clean up my comment here ...

I kinda like Twilight Struggle just for the theme. It's fun to go back and forth and watch the events and get some vaguely historical fun.

But the game has a lot of problems. It's too long for what you get out of it (some commentators have said "quick-playing" is a strength of Twilight Struggle, but at 3 hours I find it wildly overlong for what it is). Several game elements are out of whack. Realignment, for example, is worthless - how does something like this make it into a finished product? Didn't some play-tester say "hey, you know, we never, ever use realignment?". Since the geography of the game largely exists only for realignment, this seems like an issue. And I really dislike how much the game rewards simply knowing the contents of the deck, which makes things unnecessarily hard to learn and needlessly punishing of experience (not skill) differentials.

I could rant on and on about niggling little details like this, stuff that should have been ironed out if GMT had any kind of development process, but the absolute deal-killer here is play-balance. The Soviets are overwhelmingly favored between smart and/or competent players. Sure, I've heard others claim the game isn't unbalanced, but the empirical evidence on my end has now become overwhelming. Once you focus in on the important stuff, paring away all the game elements that don't matter, we haven't seen the US win in 15 games, even playing back-to-back games switching sides, with other players, etc. This is jaw-dropping considering how much luck there is in the game. And I've even found myself pulling punches as the Soviets early in the game, in the hopes of generating a more interesting game and embarrassment of getting to play the hugely favored side, and still winning handily. If the game were anywhere close to balanced you'd think you'd see the US win a few just on pure luck. But no.

Anyway. A frustrating game because with some reasonable development I think it could have been good, even very good; but it's not. I had hopes that 1960: Making of a President might show some improvement, but sadly it seems to have most of the same failings while losing traction on the theme.

Best 2-player game I've ever played. It may be the best area control game I've ever played. It's heavier than most, but well worth the play time. Super flavorful, if you love historical / political games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Overly fiddly area control game with a Cold War theme. 

On the negative side:
Far too much luck for a game that lasts 2-3 hours. Repeated plays may mitigate this somewhat, but three plays of this could take six hours and there are plenty of other area control games that I can play that are so much shorter. 

Euro mechanics, wargame production values.

The theme is wonderfully integrated. Normally this would be a positive, but one of the main themes of the Cold War was that it was a long, tedious stalemate.   

On the plus side:
Excellent clearly explained rules and fascinating background information for each event.

A very cool mesh of card driven gameplay combined with sort of an area control aspect, with all kinds of other cool little stuff thrown in such as the space race.  Lots of good tension and opportunities for swings in power, so I really admire the design.

However, I'm just going to play this game enough to get to the point where I can be at all proficient at it, as deck familiarity is a must if you want to play well (unless both players are equally clueless about what's ion the deck).

So, impressive design, but not something I'm going to seek out playing.

TS has been my favorite boardgame for quite some time now.  Like other CDGs, there is a bit of luck in how the cards come out and I am completely aware  this is not a simulation as historical events  sometimes occur anachronically in this game, but overall the feeling of a Cold War struggle as played out through event cards, coups, DEFCON restrictions, and operations, creates that tension I seek in a game about this period.  It deserves to be up there with the highest ranked games on BGG even if it is no longer number 1.  I have played some wild games of TS over the years and i keep coming back for more.

RATING: 8
Finally played the No 1 game on BGG and does it deserve the accolade. Well its a good game but it suffers from my reservations before I played it, it is still only a 2 player game and the rules seem complex at first. However after a couple of plays you will really enjoy it. You need to know what the cards do obviously so when first playing you feel a bit lost.
I still would rate several games like Agricola, Puerto Rico and others a lot higher than this but I would still put it in the top games.

Updated 5/26/10.  Wow, that needed some updating.

I've only played twice, so I still can't say much other than I really enjoy this game and I think it has a lot to offer.  Although the game has similar mechanics to 1960, Twilight Struggle feels much more thematic (although I'd love to have 1960s little text synopses about what some of the events are).  Most importantly, the fact that the game could come to an end at any moment really ratchets up the tension in a way that 1960 has been unable to duplicate. 

I can't really speak yet to issues of balance or replayability.  Although it feels like you may need to memorize the decks to be able to infer from your opponent's action what scoring cards are coming, the game comes with a handy little cheat sheet, and it's not long before new players are up to full speed.  Among particularly experienced players, I can imagine this being a truly epic showdown.  

One nitpick: I don't like the lone die used.  I'm just not a fan of dice generally, but I'll tolerate them to resolve battles in some games.  Here, I would have preferred something a little more interesting (e.g., I love the cube bag in 1960).  

The quality of the components in the deluxe edition are what one would expect from GMT - solid, but not outstanding.  The game runs a bit long for me, but unlike something like Through the Ages (or even 1960), it doesn't seem to drag.  I'm fully engaged the whole time.

All-in-all, the game hovers right in the center of the 8 range for me.  I look forward to playing it again, and I hope that it holds up to repeated plays better than its sibling.

[31/12/2006]I'll partially retract my below statement. I've decided Hannibal equally deserves the title.

Let me voice two minor criticisms of mine:

- Despite the tweak found in the 2nd ed. improving the Israeli situation, I don't think Israel quite works to my satisfaction. A  variant of mine posted on BGG modifies the Arab-Israeli War and setup a little, so as to enhance Israel's importance in the US grand strategy. 

- The space race is too much of a luck-fest, is impossible to finish within the historical timeline and  lacks any strategic depth. I've equally posted a variant of mine seeking to adress this concern of mine.

[20/1/06]I consider Twilight Struggle the crown jewel among the card-driven games. And, after Diplomacy, my all-time favourite. Yes, despite having a mere two games under my belt.

It's hard to believe this game was the designers' first game. It's a CDW (card driven wargame) that has everything I'm looking for in a game: depth, tension, long and short term decision making, moderate rules complexity, moderate playing time, and an entertaining theme that's backed by solid mechanics. It's an excellent hybrid game that's been very popular among members of both my grognard group and my euro group.

Ignore any controversy as to whether this game is balanced or not. Yes, this game does favor the Russians somewhat early in the game and the U.S. late in the game (this is by design), which results in a Russian advantage overall if both players are inexperienced. But balance issues resolve themselves quickly once players get 2 or 3 games under their belts. I've won several times as the U.S. against players with a wide range of experience.

Another point of controversy is the production problems. I'll admit they're excessive but it takes little effort to work around them.

My only complaints are the playing time and the luck. They're both just a touch too much given the level of game play provided. If there was a way to tone them down this would be a solid 9. 

UPDATE: Played many more games and these same complaints are getting to be more exasperating. Downgrading to a 7. Still a great game and I LOVE the theme.

RATING: 7.75
From what I've played, I really like the inevitability of looking down at your hand of cards and knowing you have to play every one of them, no matter if they help you or not. Properly managing your hand really makes this game, and proper timing can lead to sudden victory. Lovely designed game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
How best to manage your hand is what this game is about. When to let your opponent have access to events. Which events. What you need to do as quickly as possible.

There's also an element of deck management/building as you want your cards to get reshuffled and your opponent's to be removed from the game so that you can enjoy a late game card advantage.

And for the board, paying attention to areas which are likely to score and which you know will be influenced by cards you will be playing later in the turn. Wanting to be in many places at once, but having to prioritise. 

However, the rolling of dice for resolution is very annoying. Kind of annoying for coups. Extremely annoying for the space race. It is the aspect of the game I enjoy the least.

While the cards do not evoke the cold war for me at all, I do really enjoy playing on a world map and watching influence spread. I also appreciate how neither side is presented heroically, but villainously. It helps for me to handle the game that way because it doesn't feel like propaganda. That being said, I would understand someone not wanting to play the game based on the subject matter (murder, coup, war).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
First things first. I really don't like CDG's, or at least I haven't really found one that I connected with yet. Playing events out of hand just feels weird and athematic. I don't get it. It probably has something to with deck-knowledge being the most important skill in a CDG, which is a gameplay skill that I have very little interest in getting. It drains the game of theme in favor of meta-power-gaming. I want history and theme, but the cards are just a thin layer of both over what is ultimately an area-control cubepusher. Dullsville. 

I'd rate it a one, but it isn't exactly broken. I just hate it. A lot.

=========================================================

Only a couple of plays, but I could see this score improving as I learn the game, but I could also see myself growing irritated as I get hosed by cards. As it stands, I love the historical tidbits (even though they are built on at least a few really screwy assumptions) and I am looking forward to playing some more. 

UPDATE: Still trying to decide whether TS is a love or hate for me. Card-driven area-control has never been my favorite genre; something about getting hosed by cards leads me to wonder whether it might ultimately be something of a crapshoot. I'm not super keen on the amount of card memorizing overhead that might be required to play the game well. I will need to think more about why I haven't found a CDG I've enjoyed yet.  

UPDATE AGAIN: The evolving rating. Good stuff first. The game is a tight, and mostly fun, area-control/influence game. Each hand becomes a puzzle to be solved, and the game has tons of guessing and bluffing as you try to puzzle out why your opponents is making his plays. It has a neat veneer of a theme with cool cards and a nice looking map. 

But the game is problematic in some ways:

THEME: Some parts of the theme feel sort of right. You're balancing investing influence against more aggressive options in order to win a victory without sending the whole world over the edge. The big picture abstractions feel very much like a Cold War-themed game ought to feel. But, and this is a big one, the details are as athematic as a standard Eurogame with take-that cards. What exactly do my cards represent? Does it make any sense temporally to have an event happen every card play? Not at all: I'm just playing out a script when I really want to be engineering a strategy and authoring history. What role am I in? An abstract Geist in a bipolar world?  Thematically it feels wrong, and that it is the ultimate deal-breaker for me. 

The more I play, the less thematic it becomes, as I start to minmax your hand and wait for events. What does it mean, thematically, to win in a region when only you know that it will be "scored"? It might be sort of fun from a bluffing/gameplay perspective, but it's thematically off. None of this theme stuff really matters. It's a game, so whatever, but no sense in all the fanboy droning about the Cold War "feel"". It's off. Way off. 

Gameplay: I'm torn. On one hand it works well. You're walking a knife's edge tug-of-war in a very cool and tense way, but shit there is a lot of randomness to the event draws. A poor draw can really set back one side or the other in a big, perhaps game wasting way. I haven't played nearly enough to really know for sure, but I wonder how much if finally comes down to card-luck and exploiting a good hand. Which is fine, hand-management damage control and hand-exploitation can be a lot of fun, but I'm just not sure that I want that in a game that takes 3+ hours to play. 

In Backgammon, the swingyness of the dice balances out over the course of many games; the better player will always win when the law of large numbers kicks takes over. This may be true of TS as well, but at three hours, can one really get in enough games to balance things? I'm fine with screwy card (or dice) luck in a 45 minute game or in a game that is Uber-thematic (ASL for example), but Twilight Struggle sits in weird sorta-themed over-longish middle-ground: too long and inelegant to compete with the best Euros, and too dry and athematic to compete with the best wargames or themers.  

As with above, none of this really matters if the game isentertaining, which it mostly has been every time I've played. But #1? Nah,not even close.

Based on 1 play.

So I dig the the theme (though the components are equal parts ugly and flimsy - ick) but the length was really an issue for me.

There's hints of greatness here. The double use cards make for some excellent, tense choices but overall there were just too many small, fiddly things to keep track of. I'm sure they all tie into the strategy for those that play the game regularly, but for a first play it's just overwhelming.

The luck factor isn't huge, but comes up in some oddly frustrating ways. Certain event cards seem overly powerful and having to roll the die is fiddly and adds what feels like unnecessary luck to the game. Bleh.

Overall, I found what I was looking for in 1960 - shorter, more streamlined, no sucky die. I'd try this again but I think maybe it's just not for me.

As a hard-core, hex-and-counter wargamer (I play Advanced Squad Leader, 'nuff said), I don't consider Twilight Struggle a wargame, in that territory is not conquered, armies are not in combat, etc.  However, the Cold War was not about fighting.  It was international politics ranging from brinksmanship to detente; creating alliances; convincing the non-aligned countries that your system of government and economics was better than the other guy's.  

I find the "1" and "2" ratings and their critiques, where the only complaint being "it's not a wargame," puzzling.  How you could create a traditional wargame, moving tokens representing armies, navies, air forces over a hex map, and call it a game about the Cold War, is beyond me.  In the context of international politics, the Euro-gamish mapboard, counter placement, and card-driven mechanic of Twilight Struggle just makes sense.

1st edition:  1.5.  2nd edition:  9.0.  These ratings describe just how much I think care about production really matters for a game.  Great game or not, this is still about business to consumer.  There are plenty of great playing games that use pennys and a drawing on a lined piece of paper.  Doesn't make them $60 releases worth collecting.  I hate f***ing stupid people who say, "Still a great game.  Some words are spelled wrong, that's all." and "Just take a sharpie to it."  Anybody who got the 1st edition, I just feel sorry for you.  You got kicked in the junk by a company who could give a shit less about you.  Now with the 2nd edition, errors have been fixed and the product is at least worthy to sell to the public.  The production is still not worth the price they are charging, but whatever.  Matthews and Gupta have really designed something great with this game.  I just wish a worthwhile game company could have been the ones to release it.  It would look as good as it plays, which is brilliantly.

The best boardgame ever created. Period. Its only flaw: being strictly 2p. Twilight Struggle is as complex as chess with a rulebook as thin as any eurogame. Few designs achieve this sense of immersion in the theme with such a streamlined and fastpaced game. It rewards a lot experience, true, but it involves just the right ammount of randomness to allow the odd defeat of a strong player by a newby.

RATING: 8
It's amazing how the mechanics of the game force you into so many situations that have a parallel in actual history without the game feeling scripted at all. The strategy is deep, and while there is some luck in the card draws, it feels like each decision is important. Amazing theme and narrative. The game is just too long for what it is though, so I slightly prefer 1960 to this since that runs in 90 minutes, which feels much more appropriate to the weight of the game.

I have yet to play a more riveting game than Twilight Struggle.  Its only real drawback is it takes a little long to play, so when short on time another substitute must be found.  It's the type of game that even if you lose it you immediately want to deal it out again: not because of spite but because it's just simply amazing.

Great 2 player game. Takes alot of plays to appreciate however. You really need to know all of the cards intimately. All my plays so far have been on the net. Not sure how to get any live friends up to speed enough to play in person. Dropped it to an 8 after my first play in person. I still think it's a great game, however you would need to play ALOT to get to the meat of this game, and I don't think I have the time or the inclination.

RATING: 6
A rating of 6, you say?! Burn the heretic! Well, hear me out. TS is a fine game, it‚Äôs just too long and involved for me. To be fair, I have to state up front that I have played this four times, and only one of them ended after all 10 rounds. So while I‚Äôve played this four times and have a fairly good insight in this game (yes yes, I know, it‚Äôs nothing like having played this game hundreds of times and know all the cards, but it‚Äôs better than having played it just once, and if you know me, you‚Äôll know that I rarely play a game a lot in a short time frame), I have only once experienced the ‚Äúfull‚Äù game going all 10 rounds. But I have to say that I‚Äôm quite pleased with that as my first three plays all took 2-4 hours iirc, and the one which went all 10 rounds took 4¬Ω hours, so with extra rounds it is way too long for me to really enjoy. And the playing time is part of what‚Äôs keeping me away from exploring the depth of this game more. It‚Äôs just too long for me compared to other games I would much rather play. Gaming time is a scarce commodity, so I have to choose which games I want to play, and a game I‚Äôve rated a 6 will not get to the table a lot‚Ä¶

Usually I enjoy the games in the top 100 quite a bit, but there are some big exceptions. To name a few, Android Netrunner, Pathfinder, Eldritch Horror have all received low ratings by me, much lower than TS. I think TS is a good game and achieves what it sets out to do, but to me it‚Äôs nowhere near the best game on the BGG. But, to be fair, TS is only the number one game because so few (comparatively) have rated it; those who have played and rated it have played it because they already knew they wouldn‚Äôt hate it. At least the majority. Most are probably drawn into it by the theme, which works quite nicely due to the tons of cards with flavor text and real events, and most who sit down to play this 2 player game will therefore probably like it (compared to the next couple of games in the top100). Oh well, I don‚Äôt really care about this, I just wanted to say that I think TS is ranked artificially high as it won‚Äôt get as many ratings and plays as for instance Puerto Rico which will be tried and hated by a lot of gamers. 

I think in order to really enjoy TS, you need to be interested in the theme and be willing to spend a lot of time learning the cards! In my first game I placed some cubes in Egypt only to have them removed by an event‚Ä¶ And I did this in a couple of other countries only to have them removed by events I didn‚Äôt know existed! This lesson cost me dearly, but I was prepared for this during my next game which I won handily. I lost my last game. Whether I win or lose doesn‚Äôt really matter, but it does matter if I didn‚Äôt really stand a chance because I didn‚Äôt know that such cards could appear. Yes, I could have read the cards beforehand, but that‚Äôs exactly the problem; I don‚Äôt have time to do that, especially not for such a long game.

Now, onto the game itself. As I‚Äôve only played it four times, and only one of them went all 10 rounds, I certainly don‚Äôt claim to be an expert! I‚Äôll just state what I thought about the game after having spent 12+ hours on it. First of all I enjoyed the mix of wargame and eurogame. There is a lot of ‚Äúin your face‚Äù actions going on due to the events on the cards and the coup actions etc., and that‚Äôs something I really dig. I‚Äôm not a wargamer, but have played some of the ‚Äúlight‚Äù wargames which aren‚Äôt really full-scaled wargames (TS, C&C, Battlelore, 2deMayo). I think it‚Äôs a genre that I‚Äôm going to explore more in the feature, but for now I‚Äôm a fullblooded eurogamer, and this is why I fancy the area majority/control scoring throughout the game. You can get a ton of points if you‚Äôre playing a scoring card at the right time, and it‚Äôs tense when you don‚Äôt know when a scoring will occur! The way you play your cards for action points or for the events and that the other player can benefit from an event is really a great idea and helps minimizing the luck of the draw, though luck certainly still plays a part considering the random draw of the cards and the random die rolls when attempting a coup etc.

The space race track is a neat idea too as you can play a card which benefits your opponent too much. However‚Ä¶ I have to say that the space track also introduces a huge randomness to the game. A randomness which cannot be mitigated and is 100 % based on the roll of a die‚Ä¶ And, to me, that‚Äôs really unacceptable! At least for a game which lasts this long and otherwise leave your brain burning when you‚Äôre trying to figure out which card to play and whether to use it as an event or not. I lost my one game which lasted all 10 rounds by 2 points ‚Äì but my opponent almost didn‚Äôt miss a roll on the space track and got a total of 7 points on me because of this‚Ä¶ And he also got some huge advantages! This really, really, really rubbed me the wrong way, because what if it had been the other way around? I cannot see how I wouldn‚Äôt have won in that case, so did it really just come down to a roll of the dice on the space track? That kind of sucks‚Ä¶ I know that there are cards which let you catch up, but it‚Äôs hard to do so if your opponent draws those few cards‚Ä¶ I know there is also randomness in the card draws and in the coup attempts etc., but the outcome of the space race track is something I whined and still whine about!

All in all, I just think that you need to invest too much time in TS in order for it to really shine, and even if you do, the game is going to run too long for my taste. The whole system is quite good, though, and I actually enjoy 1960: The Making of the President quite a bit which TS is often compared to. 1960 is more accessible due to its easier rules and gameplay and shorter play time (but to be fair I personally don‚Äôt think the game mechanics have that many similarities). I will definitely play TS again and hopefully explore all 10 rounds, but if I had the choice I would probably always prefer to play 1960. And, luckily, I do have a choice. So for now Twilight Struggle will only get a rating of 6.

An excellent two player game, and probably my favorite of all of them.  During the later stages of the game, there is nearly as much tension between plays of the cards as there was during the Cold-War itself (okay, that is an exageration...).  And excellent back and forth battle that very closely resembles the actions immediately following WWII.

Note:  My comments on the game are the same for each version in terms of game play.  However, the Deluxe version is a superior product due to the board and the chit quality.

Well it finally happened - finally got to play the #1 game on BGG and to see if it's worthy of that title. The answer? Maybe...

It's certainly a fantastic game and definitely in my top 5. I think the mechanics of Agricola or Game of Thrones are just so good that they will remain in my top spots. But I digress - let's get back to this game.

When I first read the rules, I thought that this game was a luck fest due to the card draws. I also though it would be super tactical. I was wrong on the first point, and only half right on the second. The first game I admit that not knowing the cards kind of limited my play - but only to an extent. I slowly realized that just like real life, the game throws things at you and the best person to deal with that would win. And just like in real life, you can do a whole lot to prepare for those situations.

Ensuring you are within a fighting chance of areas you know will be scored during a round - or establishing a foothold in a new area - or keeping up with the space race - there are definitely a lot of things that demand your attention and keep your interest.

So even though playing the cards is highly tactical, there is also a high degree of strategy involved to make sure you are setup to deal with the unexpected. For example, if I know I am going to lose one area, I can try to sneak into another area that I know will also be scored. But maybe I can do it in such a way that the other guy thinks I still want to protect the area I know I am going to lose. There is a lot of interesting mind play in this game and I've only begun to scratch the surface of that. Just like in the real cold war, you can play with your opponents emotional and analytical side and attempt to manipulate them into areas of the board you can afford to lose. This is one of a very few games where my heart rate sped up during some points while I held my best poker face waiting for my opponent to make a move I knew would eventually help me.

I think the real brilliance of this game is that it hides very complex strategic gameplay behind very simple tactical mechanics. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
It really is as good as everyone says it is. The whole game is frenzied damage control. It seems like you never have a good hand of cards and your opponent is sweating thinking the same thing. Realignment and Space Race rolls suck, they never seem to go my way. Still, I could play Twilight Struggle all day long and never get bored. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The decisions are gut-wrenching when you have to play those cards that you don't want to play.  This game certainly has tension and atmosphere and I can highly recommend it for any fan of the cold war, card driven games, or really... any gamer.

Rated 7 after one "half play." But, that's not easy to rate, as the first play was a learning game. To rate this properly I need to try it again, especially now that maybe I have a clue of what I'm supposed to be doing.

It's a lengthy two-player-only game, so I'll never own it, but I'd like to try this again. The rating could go anywhere from a 9 to a 5... who knows at this point!

This is a fantastic area control/wargame. Identification of battleground states, structure political point-to-point connections and the event card effects, make this game really feel like it is recreating history.  I can always see the world struggle for dominance unfold.

I love how the game starts small with USA and USSR devoting their resources heavily for a few regions.  However, by the mid-game the whole world is up for grabs and you have to pay attention to so many aspects all at once. Balancing your need for Ops points with not activating your opponents weighty events is a tantalizing struggle.

It was what I was hoping for. My expectations had been lowered by playing 1960 first, which I didn't like. This was tense. The theme was captured well. The gameplay is all mind games and trying to sneak unnoticed past your ooponent. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This game feels like risk done right.  The historical importance of every card adds to the illusion in the game, meanwhile every turn is vitally important as you try to outmaneuver your opponent.  There can certainly be some luck involved in card draws, but the game has some wonderful ways of mitigating that through the space race and headline phase.

RATING: 6
I can't figure out why people call this a war-game. It's a card driven game triggering on mainly political events. 
The game is quite complex and not easy to learn. Remembering all the cards is the only way to get involve into the atmosphere of the game.  
Thematically, to win in a region when only you know that it will be scored.  It's a massive text card drafting game with a board pasting a cold war theme.  Not my cup of tea. Give up my copy with no regrets!  I still give it to 5.5 because of its education value not the game play mechanism.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.1
6 plays

TS suffers from three major weaknesses: it's not very rewarding given its length of play, it's sub-par components make it difficult to attract newbies to the game, and finally the hand of chance in the form of dice has a huge impact given the game's length.  

To my mind, the die rolls of the space race make no sense, that one player could be three or four positions in and the other still not have achieve satellite orbit ... makes no sense.

I also found it to be one of those CDGs that aren't much fun once you know the cards.  Play becomes Chess-like, stilted and at times wildly ahistorical.

TS is a good game, worth its cover price, but don't expect to play it dozens of times or keep it for years.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
This game has the best use of theme of any that I have played.  The card driven aspect of the game makes things unpredictable, which makes sense given the nature of the cold war.  I love games that are based on history, and this one certainly doesn't disappoint.  It takes long enough feel epic without consuming an entire day, and allows me to get my grand strategy fix.  I'm glad to see it rapidly rising on BGG.

Thematically rich, very engaging, and quite a good experience. But overall, not my type of game. Between the tit-for-tat and the card knowledge and the sheer length of the game, it just isn't for me. My guess is that after a number of plays, the card knowledge mitigates the tit-for-tat as players learn to just cut their losses and play hands better, but I don't know that I'll ever dedicate the table time to get to that point. But I certainly understand why it is as highly ranked as it is.

First playing revealed a wonderful light wargame.  Playing an ops card forces the event to happen in the case that it favors your opponent.  That was one of my main gripes with the single-deck card driven wargames.  Great innovation.  Very thematic game which captures the flavor of the cold war with minimal, basically no, chrome.  Rules are concise and functional.  I don't know if it will hold up to repeated plays, but right now I'm in awe.  If it holds up to lots of repeated plays, this could be a ten.

:tobacco: :( :D A very well-designed game to be sure, but falling into the Elvis/Shakespeare/Beatles category of cultural artifacts that are both very, very good and somewhat overrated.

When people talk about [i]design for effect[/i], this is pretty much the very thing they're talking about. Twilight Struggle does not make more than a handwavey attempt at accurately simulating the complexities of the Cold War. All of this makes for a very entertaining game but not at all a simulation ‚Äì to its credit, the designers are frank enough about not even attempting such a thing. Which is a good design decision in a lot of ways but it does lose something if your goal is, at least in part, thematic immersion. Good players of Twilight Struggle (and books can and have been written about Twilight Struggle strategy) excel in part through mastery of gamey tactics that end up feeling like more of a jarring departure from the narrative than you would encounter in other CDGs. Likewise, the limitations of the bipolar superpower model -- allegiance being a more or less straightforward with-us-or-agin‚Äô-us thing, the implicit acceptance of the domino theory that pretty much every political scientist who‚Äôs thought about the matter (the game designer included) has long concluded is bullshit -- lead to some pretty wonky disjoints between game and reality. The idea of De Gaulle being some sort of philo-Commie (an assertion that no doubt has racked up some serious entombed RPMs in Colombey-les-Deux-Elgises) is ‚Ä¶ odd. Likewise, the complex and fraught USSR-China-USA love triangle getting reduced to a single card, the abstraction-to-near-nothingness (yeah, Quagmire and Bear Trap, but they just sort of [i]happen[/i], they‚Äôre not the result of hubris or overextension or what have you) of Vietnam and Afghanistan, etc., etc. And let‚Äôs just not talk about the ‚Äúyay, my opponent rained fire and cesium isotopes on my major cities, I win‚Äù thing.

I mean, whatever, right? The game works. It works quite well. And board games, especially the ones that are designed to be, y‚Äôknow, fun, are generally rotten simulations of anything. And I [i]like[/i] design for effect. But there‚Äôs something about the gameyness of Twilight Struggle ‚Äì and I freely admit this may be a knock-on effect of the many wise things that have been written about the strategy, which in turn is a knock-on of the game‚Äôs massive (by complex-hobby-game standards) popularity ‚Äì that takes me out of The Moment and prevents me from seeing the masterpiece that so many see.

Bitch bitch bitch. I still like this game. I‚Äôm not dissing Twilight Struggle, really. I would rather play Twilight Struggle than a hundred anonymous Euro cube-twiddlers or just about any Ameritrash joint you can name. It‚Äôs a good game, with difficult decisions that give you a frisson of genuine Cold War paranoia as you try to suss out whether the loathsome godless Communist oppressor is marching through Latin America because he‚Äôs holding a scoring card or just because he‚Äôs trying to mess with your head. I just feel like it‚Äôs worth elucidating why I think I‚Äôd, on balance, rather play Labyrinth, or the COIN series, or Wilderness War, or a whole mess of other CDGs, even as I appreciate the work that was done on this title.

The #1 game on BGG should not be inherently unbalanced (unless it's a "first turn" bias, which is normal).  Yes, there are optional cards and hacks to balance this game and, yes, it's still a great game, but there will always be other games that I rate higher than this one until the rules officially balance this game.

Rulebook is terrible; The main mechanics of the game aren't that complicated and we still struggled to figure them out.
Lots of randomness with regards to which cards you draw. I won the game in 2 turns by drawing two scoring cards and stacking the deck for myself.
1d6 die rolls determine important strategic outcomes. 
You can tell the game was designed by a couple of people w/out game design experience for their own recreation of history. It is not a very well designed game.

Amazing. Absolutely love the theme, the mechanics, and the illusion that you're genuinely affecting the destiny of your super power. Another game that doesn't get played anywhere near enough for my liking. Nothing comes close in terms of drama and tension.

UPDATE: Sadly, this will never be played again because I don't have a willing opponent.

UPDATE 2.0: Sold in October 2015. Despite the depth, replayability and sheer awesomeness of this game I always found myself struggling to find an opponent, so it was just taking up space on my already creaking shelf. One day I'll buy it again. I just need to make sure I have an intelligent, willing opponent.

My first and favorite CDG.  The game is easy to learn but difficult to master.  I find the individual actions to be remarkable accurate on such an abstract level.  I also enjoy reminiscing of the events being a child of the 80's - especially once the late war deck is introduced.

My reasons for not giving this the full 10 is that I am worried about eventual replayability.  With such a tight deck and more familiarity of the cards, I am afraid it may become too scripted.  However, I really enjoy it now and look forward to many more games.

A very good game about the Cold War and the effects different events of the time had on the world scene.
It is a balance between choosing actions and denying the opponent the same actions.
If one is not interested in the history of the cold war the game is not going to be a hit. This game do not belong as a top game here on BGG due to the fact that the game mechanics is not that fantastic and the game theme do not attract the majority of gamers (IMHO).
For those that are interested in the theme (like me) both the game mechanics and the actual game is outstanding and is also a fantastic source of learning of the events that shaped the world during the 50 years after the second world war.

I really didn't think that I would like this game, the cards seemed to fiddily, like one bad hand could lose you the game, like in hammer of the scots. After playing it 3.5 times (the .5 was for a Russian turn 1 victory : hint if you are the US player always place enough influence to control West Germany during setup!, don't forget about De Gaul, and watch for coups in Italy!) Yes bad hands will happen, but it makes for lots of good choices as you try to make the best of a bad situation. The same can be said for the dice, as a few rolls one way or the other can swing the game, but I feel that these add "story moments" to the game, how an unlikely coup in West Germany succeed, giving the Russians a toehold in Europe after E. Germany and Poland have become dominated by the US. I really see now how this has shot up so high on the charts. Great game.

Update: I've played this probably 20 times now, it is still a great game, with a new layer of depth as I know most of the cards well now, especially the early and mid war ones and so I go out of my we to counter act them before they might be played.Raised my rating to 9.5 from 8.5

Most overrated game I have played so far. Dice rolls for superimportant decisions plus randomness of the cards (which sometimes also imclude random effects) made me really the games played at all. Once you get the strategic important spots on the map, which happens pretty fast and play by the scoring cards only very little depth remains. From its conception (except the dice) it should be a game I normally like. In fact I would never want to play this again.

First playthrough I was clueless. All the events made it seem totally random. After reading a few strategy guides we played it once more realizing it is primarily operation points driven rather than event driven and we started actually figuring out what we were doing. This is a game of multiple layers: hand management, deck management, strategic planning and luck. I got interested in the history of the cold war era after playing it. A masterpiece!

The brilliance of this game revolves around its theme and the elegance of its design. After just a few turns, its mechanisms disappear and what you are left is a re-enactment of the global historical drama of the cold war. 

+ elegant mechanisms that serve the theme extremely well
+ exceptional hand management rules (no discards, keep 1, ...)
+ new nuances continuously unfold with repeated plays
+ simple to teach and play
+ evocative of a historical period that I care about

= you need to learn the cards to play the game well

A classic game experience that is beyond and above the sum of its parts. One of the best games ever designed, indeed.

My first playing was enjoyable. I have to admit, I'm pretty shocked that a gaffe like "Chili" made it through production, but I am willing to overlook that for the game play. Initially, the theme didn't grab me when others had high anticipation. But after playing it once I really enjoyed it. Now, after more play....I have to agree with those who say the luck is too high for this type of game.Positives: The complexity contained in a very accessible ruleset. The total playing time for the game was successfully kept in a very reasonable range. There are lots of interesting decisions. The game also generates a neat narrative as you play. The general pendulum of momentum...starting with the Soviets and swinging back to the US as you go.Negatives: For the amount of complexity that the decisions give you...the wild swings in momentum that can come from a crappy hand or even single cards (like Red Scare), combined with many die rolls that are all or nothing....and its not hard for a player with inferior play to actually win the game. I don't mind that aspect in some games, but here it doesn't seem congruent with the depth the game otherwise holds.I'd be willing to play again, and would enjoy many aspects. But given my choice I'm likely to suggest something else. 

Update: I've increased my rating to a 7.  After several games I'm starting to be familiar enough with the cards that the game is less frustrating. Every once in a while, the combination of card luck and dice luck can overwhelm the importance of decision-making....which is very frustrating. For some reason, that amount of bad luck in most wargames would seem to be negotiable, where here it isn't. But if that doesn't occur, the game can be enjoyable and satisfying. Played quickly, I can tolerate the occasional dud game. Still, given my druthers I'd much rather play Hannibal or Paths of Glory.

RATING: 7
I don't generally play a lot of 2 player games, nor games printed by GMT, but I love the Cold War theme on this one, and the mechanics sounded interesting, so I gave it a go.

I think this is a solid 2 player option. The entire affair is basically an area influence game that is driven by heavily themed cards. For the 5 people that haven't played this game yet: cards are from a shared deck. Each round, each of the players gets a mitt of them, and they then can use the cards to put down more influence on the board directly, or to trigger events. Some of the cards have events for only one side, and if you play a card that has an event for your opponent, you must let them do it before or after placing your own pieces with it.

There are a huge number of thematic touches to this game even beyond the card deck itself (which is chock full of historical events). For instance, DEFCON is an extremely important thing to keep track of, and the threat of nuclear war keeps either side from executing too many direct power plays for much of the game. The Space Race is also present in a minor, though useful way.

I think this is a game that will gain with repeat play and added familiarity. For the time being, I say it's good, and I would enjoy playing it most times that I have the opportunity, but it probably isn't something I will buy. Good stuff though, and I could see my rating going up rather than down.

Œúost probably the best H2H game I played
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
The essence of this game is one of direct confrontation and this is very much a core wargame characteristic. After all, this game does come from possibly the best large current wargame publisher GMT.

However this game has a lot to offer the non-wargamer.  The rules are simple but the gameplay is still rewarding this is considered a core characteristic of the best strategy  euro-games.  I would say that the rule book definitly comes from a wargame publisher and is initially less concise and clear than most equivalent Euro's.

The theme matches deceptively well with game mechanics and the historical context (its worth reading the design notes) there is no pasted on theme here.  The domino theory is used as a model which fits in with western geopolitial thinking from the period.  It may not fit all the current theories (or even match current mainstream wisdom) but places the players in a appropriate historical mindset.

2014
Even when the game hands me my opponents cards (not good in this game) I can formulate a plan to retain one, use the space race to flush another (two later in the game) and finally trigger the remaining cards when they are less dangerous.  A lot of the games that are compared with Twilight are mechanically similar and produce a good narrative but often give players less sense of power.  This is great thematic twist the great powers did not just react to events they also drove them even when they were less favourable.

In The Making of the President 1960 have a feeling the cards play me, in TS I play the cards.

This will be a must buy on IOS.

A tremendous piece of game design that by rights should go down in history as one of the seminal and significant games of our time.  There have been several excellent card-driven wargames precipitated by the now-classical Mark Herman designs (including real treasures like Wilderness War and Paths of Glory) but what really sets Twilight Struggle apart from its peers is its amazing ability to provide accessible, straightforward gameplay without sacrificing historical detail, richness, and narrative.  This is a game you can explain in 15 minutes to a complete newbie and within 2-3 hours you've burned through 45 years of tension, turmoil, and upheaval.  The game's systems are logical and remarkably stripped down yet never so abstract as to deny specificity.  The cardplay, as we've come to expect from the genre, provides not only a sense of playing through a timeline but also multiple decision points in each hand- what to play, how to play, when to play.  The theme is a knockout and the use of wargame mechanics to portray an abstracted war is nothing short of genius.  GMT's production is, as usual, functional and somewhat spartan but that being said the mapboard is probably their most attractive piece to date.  Folks, seriously, if you're interested in anything from hardcore wargames to middle-weight Euros, this is one to pick up and savor for many years to come.  The bar is set for wargames of this type fairly high by Twilight Struggle, and I can't wait to see if Mr. Gupta and Mr. Matthews are ready to push it up even higher in the future.  A bravura performance of economy, grace, and sophistication.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
There's a ton of fun and strategy packed into a relatively small package.  There's a bit of luck involved with the die rolling and all, but not to a significant extent.  A few good rolls won't win you the game.

Waiting to see how the game changes for me after more plays.  Once the Early War cards are very familiar to me, I'll be playing a different game altogether.  Right now, it's still hard to really plan ahead (with a few exceptions - DeGaulle, Blockade, Fidel, Nasser, and some others).

My first hobby game and I'm still enamored with it. I love the decisions that the hand management creates. It really is about mitigating the bad and striking when opportunities arise.

The new mounted board is really nice. The card quality is very good. I do not care for the "double thick counters".

They out to have gone to a truly euro game grade counter that do not have those.

I was initially drawn in by the Cold War theme. Now, after about half a dozen plays on the app (which is excellent) this game has its hooks in me.

There is certainly randomness, but much in the same way that poker has randomness. And much like poker, the better player will regularly come out on top.

Mitigation of the luck element IS the game. It is incredibly satisfying to be dealt a "bad" hand and to get through the round without giving up much ground to your opponent.

It seems that the game is somewhat tilted toward the USSR, but I am willing to chalk that up to my novice status.

Played this with Paul (as Russia). A very nicely put together game. I can see why this is number one, as I think it appeals to many gamers. 

It is hard to find fault with any aspect of the game.

The thing I liked about it the most is that I see this as the 'ideal weight'. Plenty of tactical depth, but with a very streamlined set of rules and mechanics. Makes it a smooth and enjoyable gaming experience.

Rating after 6 plays. The game feels like a cross-over between euro and ameritrash - maybe it is the reason why it has so high rating? It feels more ameritrash to me because the theme seems to dominate the mechanics more than it should in a euro and because of the element of luck, especially the luck in card draws. Nonetheless, luck does not play as big role in this game as some critics claim - you can lose the game because of bad luck but, in general, the risks can be managed. I rated the game high for three reasons: first, the game is tense and challenging: there are always many meaningful actions but never enough resources (rating +3); second, constant bluffing and reading 'between the lines' - you have to pay close attention to your opponent and you have to try to hide your own agenda (rating +2); thirdly, I like the theme -  the  game is far from being historically accurate but you can always relate your actions to some events in history (regardless of whether they are represented in the game) and make witty comments about your opponent moves :) (rating +1). 

I have some doubts about the replayability, though. If the game holds up after 10 or so plays, I will probably give it the highest rating.

RATING: 10
One of the best, most obsessive and compelling games I've ever played.  Maybe it's only flaw is that the Kennedy game makes this one feel a little bit more chit fiddly than it needs to be.  A little. And an experienced player who knows what cards are in the deck will have too much of an advantage (but that maybe a symptom of all card driven games).  

But you know what, now that I'm getting to that stage myself I'm learning the incredible level of depth here.  Love, love, love this game.

*update* Okay, I've gone and given this game the 10 it deserves.  Frankly after a couple plays the Kennedy/Nixon game is a vague afterthought compared to this.  TS reigns.

Not recommended at all - it takes a really long time to play, the actual process of play isn't much fun, and luck/randomness weighs hugely in who wins.

RATING: 9
Excellent game. The rulebook is fairly short for a wargame, about 11 pages of actual rules. It is light for a wargame but fairly heavy by eurogame standards. The complexity is about at the level of Age of Steam. An area-majority game; not a traditional wargame.  

I love that it's highly educational about the Cold War. You play either the US or the Soviet Union, and it gives you a great feel the global dynamics of the Cold War period, as well as informing you about the major events of the time.

I thought the Cold War would be a very uninteresting theme for a game, but I was wrong in the case of this game.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.9
A fun sink of time.  Play doesn't seem to drag because players' actions are usually quick and there's always something to think about.  

Would give this game a higher score if it weren't for a few things: confusing connections between countries, vague descriptions on cards with no clarifications in rules, tedious need to know what cards have and haven't been played yet, unpleasant art design.

#1, really? I don't get it. I own it, but it's hard for me to justify the time. Wheres as I love some equally long (or longer) games, like Dominant Species, in that game you at least know what someone is thinking about when they're thinking (which usually isn't very long anyway), but in this game when someone is thinking, you have nothing to do but stare into space. But most importantly, there's a LOT of work involved in learning how to play correctly. There is a 16 page faq, and still rules I can't figure out the answer to. Sure, I could ask in the rules forum, and then get chastised for not reading the 64 pages of rules first. Some people say only the rules lawyers really care. Well, excuse me for wanting to know what the actual rules are, you know, like what I can and can't do, and what the consequences actually are. You can just make up ruling, but that's not very satisfying, and usually the person who it's against feels cheated. For a sampling, just see [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/97390/collected-rulings]this thread[/url]. I think if I had someone who knew the game cold, I would be interested in playing more, but I don't have such a person, and I feel my motivation level is very low for putting forth the effort required to become such a person.

Great game for two players. It has simple rules which force you to make difficult choices. Whatever happens on a board, you are supposed to "trade" some benefits from your played cards. 

Absolutely amazing theme (at least for me since whole 20th century it's the least known but most fascinating history period for me).

With time it might become repeatable (since there are some absolutely crucial objectives during Early War). However, there's still a vast number of options for each played card and results are often dice-determined so that you'll rarely experience any routine during game.

Few (in any) other 2-player board games can offer you better fun than that one once you and your opponent master own tactics.

Two player game about the Cold War. Players take turn playing cards to establish presence on a world map. Lots of dice rolling, but this is moderated by uneven odds determined by the game state.

Recent plays have convinced me that underneath the theme there's a real game here, and one that grows better successive plays.

RATING: 8
This is a simulation, not a game. This is a simulation of the Cold War, just as World in Flames is a simulation of WWII. Simulations do not need to be fair, balanced, or fun. They are required to have reproducible results. I've played many times and enjoy the simulation very much. On a lighter note, this simulation does remind me of Harry's Grand Slam Baseball in that cards must be played even if they are not in your favor.

If you like games that allow you to make your own choices without someone (especially the person you are playing) being able to immediately see is a bad one, this is a good game.  There is a random factor, but nothing that I can't deal with.

I'm not a big fan of zero sum games, and this is no different. I intensely disliked the way that events triggered for your opponents when you played them. It just doesn't work for me at all. As someone who enjoys games of hand management, that was a killer. I lost when my opponent finished moved us to defcon 1 on my turn and I've never been so glad to lose.

I'm not going to sit here and tell you that the number one game of BoardGameGeek is trash.  I respect you too much for that.  I will say, that I hate this game almost as much as I hate Communism.  It kills me to give the game a 2, since it's getting awfully close to a red color, but when in a Soviet Satellite...

The game is long like a bread line, and it feels like I'm making the same type of decision every turn.  And there's a lot of turns!  If the Cold War had been settled by playing this game, both sides would have left the table and gone off to play something more exciting like golf or watch the Paint Drying Championships of the Greater Spokane Area.  So maybe that would have been good.

This is clearly a great game that is just aggressively not for me. I don't care about the theme at all and am not a big fan of the tug of war style back and forth political gameplay, even less so when dice rolling is involved.

I have owned it for many years and have only played it a handful of times. Each time I have to go back over the instructions to remember the details. It is a 2 person game and almost always I am playing games with more people so it does not come out often. Its a long game. So to teach the game (and remember the game) and then play is a long game session.  These are the reasons I did not score it a 10.  

So why a 9?  The game is so much fun!  There are so many options and decisions to make. The way you play is also based on what your opponent is doing.  I always want to get the next deck and see what is next.  Considering the amount of pieces and trackers the upkeep is quick and easy. I love going into the manual and reading the additional historical detail on the cards. It deserves a LOT more play then I give it.

GMT Games.  Amazing, tense 1:1 Cold War card driven war game.  This is the best game on the cold war that I have ever seen or played.  The action is non stop.  The events on the cards play right out of history.  Brinkmanship and pushing your influence worldwide is present.  Coups are possible.  The scoring mechanism is neat.  Most players can learn this game in under 30 minutes and then have a blast playing it.  Twilight Struggle is even more satisfying for those of us that lived part or all of the cold war or are students of the cold war.  Fantastic game - enough said!!!

This game was extremely intimidating when my wife and I first played.... that game didn't go so well. It was long and draggy.
But the second play.... oh man.... once we got that first play out of the way,... man was it fun. Time went quick, as did the turns between players. So much to do, so little time! Many options per turn, lots of tension on every action. But not overwhelmed with what you should do to get to the win. Plus lots of player interaction and internal player strategy.

That being said, when I am in the mood to play this game it can be a very good experience. I love history, and this game is OOZING with cold war history. Its is sort of a weird bridge between war-gaming and regular board gaming.

Engaging. Educational. Asymmetrically. Enough variability due to random card draw. A unique game to my collection that needs lots of global strategic planning. Does not require that much learning.

Comments based on one full game; will definitely play again.  Time to play full game was about 2.5 hours including going through all the rules (short 8 pages).  Very good game with many interesting (and difficult) decisions.  

I can see this becoming one of my favorite games to play; an excellent meld of decent history (De Gaulle and Brandt notwithstanding) with good tense cardplay and agonizing decisions.  Highly recommended.

Further play has made this one of my top 5 games.  Fast playing, plausible narrative, and every decision is difficult.

Nothing other than Grand Austria Hotel and this, but somehow maybe this a little more so, sucks me out of my life and into a game this much. These can literally change my mood. 

It still isn't my type of game, but I caught the scent on the breeze blowing by of what it is trying to deliver.

And now I do understand why it is loved.

I like what I know of it, but I doubt that we know enough to fully play by the rules as far as carrying out the cards correctly every time. So I view our wins and losses with some distrust.

Yet it is still fun. I won by 1 point as the U.S. in turn 10 last game but I really was wanting to win in turn 7 with War Games but she played Iranian Hostage plus Terrorism and it discarded my War Games. Oh well. Still a pretty fun round but that was pretty lucky of her.

RATING: 9
Tense, exciting, and fun, one of the best CDGs out there.  Simple in its mechanic, but driven by the random nature of scoring cards and the gradual progression to late war, this game has you fighting over all corners of the globe in true cold-war fashion.  This is also an excellent game to get many Gen-X non-gamers into, as they likely remember the cold war and can appreciate how tense the struggle really was.

What makes this a little less than perfect? There is a definite advantage to those who play this game a lot over those that are just starting out.

Everything about this game is perfect. I find it easy to teach and difficult to master. This is the game that brought me back into boardgaming after a long absence. what I like about this game (and some others hate) is that there are too many things to do and not nearly enough actions to do them. Then you need to make the important decision; do I use operational points and allow my opponent have a good event - or do I ignore my important event to use operation points? You also need to determine the order that you play your cards. The numerous amount of variables equates to a mentally exhausting but equally rewarding game.

The giant monolith standing astride the BGG rankings for quite some time now, and with good reason.  Dead simple mechanics and insanely deep strategy.  Wargaming done right, if somewhat nontraditionally.  The fact that I'm endlessly fascinated by the theme is a pure bonus, as my love of 1989, 1960, and Labyrinth will attest.

Oh look, you have to blockade in Israel and you have to contain the Soviets in Cuba and you have to do several other things.

RATING: 9
Most possible THE best CDG, blurring the lines between euros and war games, while still holding the atmosphere and gameplay of a Cold War game. It helps that it can be played in about three hours, so that it doesn't take the commitment of a whole day (I'm looking at YOU, POG), and with five minute set up - a modern classic!

Edit after many years of playing...

Still a modern masterpiece. Really, a ground breaking moment in boardgame design, and I hope we can see more like it. But still, there can be only one. Why can't I quit you?!??!!?

This is one of the great games. You have to block out about 5 hours if you play at our (slow) pace, so it won't work for everyone all the time. But the sheer richness of strategic and tactical choices, the variety of in what order and when the cards come up, the scope of the game -- encompassing about a half-century and across the whole world map -- just awesome. Congratulations to the designers, and thank you, GMT Games. Wow.

Originally Alex's copy, but having battered it about a bit I bought him a "Like New" copy and kept his original one. I can't say anything that everyone else hasn't already said. It's a very unique game that suffers from some [deliberate] balance issues and which therefore means I've rarely had the game last all the way to the Late War section. I think the only reason I can't give this a 10 is because of the wildly varying lengths games can be - which makes it a hard game to schedule - and because I think sometimes historical accuracy has been prioritised too much over playability. It's a minor complaint though, and I can't wait for the "what if?" expansion, or the hopefully eventual release on iPhones and not just iPads!

I like Twilight Struggle, but it's such a long game and after playing it 3 times...there seems to always be some minor mistake we make which sort of ruins the end experience of winning. Eventually I'll play a mistake free (rules) game and probably enjoy it even more.

RATING: 8
Very good two player game that can take a few hours to complete.  Tonnes of Cold War flavour as the cards use real events such as The Marshall Plan and Cuban missile crisis. The fact that you can't be sure whether your opponent is just about to score a region makes for some very tense gameplay and scary decisions.

This is an incredible game. An absolute masterpiece. Emotive, technically fulfilling, and promotes a keen interest in our modern history. Play this with my partner once every few months- set it up in a corner and play a couple of rounds before bed after the kids are asleep. Laugh about the game in between sessions and look forward to it as one of the highlights of the day. She's not a board gamer. I've got lots to do. It's just that good. For me Twilight Struggle is a celebration of what makes board games so relevant and necessary in the digital age- there's fantastic interaction when playing this game, a very friendly competitiveness, a profoundly deep sense of narrative and engagement that you won't find in many other mediums.

Very good game, but amount of luck and duration seems a bad global mixture. I know you can control luck when knowing the cards, but some combinations are so deadly.

A really interesting card-game which takes in lots of the history of the era without bogging the system down with rules exceptions.

This is an excellent card driven game and it takes much less time than most of them. I am partial to this game and Labyrinth when I don't have all day to play. Both those games are highly recommended for PBEM too. I liked TS enough to spring for the deluxe edition.

RATING: 10
The theme is fantastic in this game, and the tension in the card play fits the Cold War very well. A very fun card driven area control game (not a wargame). Minor complaint would be extreme variability in game length (full 10 turns can be many hrs, but I've ended under an hour on Turn 4). Also if the scoring cards happen to go to one player early, this can be a big advantage, esp. the USSR.

Looked dry and dull, but it was ranked at the top, so I thought I'd try. So glad I did! Spectacular game. Seems to me to be very effective at providing two very asymmetrical teams with overall great balance. The tension in this game tops every other game I've tried; I've seen an opponent spend the entire game in actual physical discomfort from the constant "1 step forward, 0 to 2 steps back" that permeates this game. I only wish it had a more predictable length.

Initial thoughts put this one at 10, but I predict a lack of opportunity to play it face to face.  I hope that doesn't happen, as this is the kind of game I want to play over and over again (and is more than good enough to do so).  Unfortunately, that doesn't fly in today's overwhelmed-with-new-games, and cult-of-the-new obsessed gamer population.  Of course, I could go digital for opponents, but there's less flexibility there for me [with 3 little ones at home].

It's claimed that once you've studied the strategies, the cards, the probability tables for realignment rolls and coup attempts, and the long FAQ, this game becomes "awesome."  As in, best board game of all time awesome.

That's a stretch. At the very least, DEFCON suicide cards should be notated as such. Also, while the rules are only moderately complex, a game should make me want to play and study it, not force me to play and study in order to like it.  Nevertheless, after several plays, I can understand the game's appeal, and I appreciate it much more than I once did.

First play felt too lopsided with the events. Playing through the second time and understanding the potential risks of going into each area makes this game much more interesting. The re-alignment rolls make for more tactical decisions and add to the tensity. Having played 50 games online for each side now I can see how this has a lot of strategic potential (but not exactly perfect game).

A tense strategy game where very rarely are your actions wholly beneficial to you. Everything you do has an impact and you have to carefully watch your opponent. Cards can quickly shift favor one way or another, but there is always a chance to right the balance of power.

All in all a blast, loved by everyone I've played it with. Even if I've never won yet! The downsides for me are its long playtime and fiddly nature. Not huge critiques, admittedly, but enough to bring it down ever so slightly.

This game requires an investment in time and study a lot of people (me included) simply can't afford. Playing at a satisfying level requires both players to DEEPLY know the deck and all the strategic implications of playing each single card. This require TENS of hours of gameplay on both sides. It's not a game you can casually pick up and play one night, even in a geeky game group (unless your gamegroup is made of 2 people and you have no other games). You need to know the game and you need a partner that does the same. I didn't play many games, but it was clear games would be very lengthy and plagued with analysis paralisis.
In short, this game is hard both to learn and to master. And it's strictly for 2 players. Also, there's way too much luck for my taste (rolling dice and drawing cards are the bulk of the gameplay). I traded this game out and I'm not regretting it. I don't feel it deserves being #1 on BGG.

An excellent two player game that oozes theme - strangely enough, because the gameplay is pretty abstract. There are no boring mements because every decision feels really important and there is plenty of room for strategic play. It's really interesting how this game manages to make every single one of your decisions to feel like it can decide the game. twilight Struggle is a long game, but the lenght is more than justified by the content. I don't think I've played any other two player game as tense as this - maybe except Go.

I put off buying this because it seemed heavy, and I had heard it described as a war game with cards. Very glad I went against my instincts - it's a _great_ game. Because the other players moves have direct consequences for you and can benefit you, you don't have a strong sense of downtime. On your turn trying to not benefit the other player, along with having to pick and choose where to deploy on the board adds tension. The rules will need a pass and it's probably worth a few dummy turns to get a feel for the game flow, but it's well worth it, because the game has genuine replayability and rewards expertise.

The mechanisms work perfectly with the theme to create a very tense game. You are the head of one of the superpower and strive to develop your long term strategy while dealing with crisis. On the board it is a simple game of influence and areas majority, but the cards play leads to agonizing choices and add all the chrome of the era. Much more theme than the average Eurogame.

Not for everyone, the rules are 8 pages, but playing time is 3 hours and nerves wrecking. There is also a learning curve. It is not a military simulation either but a game of strategical planning in a chaotic environment. There is some luck in the dice and cards but the game reward skills and poise.

Very good replayability.

After 6 years I finally managed to play this game. And after all the great things a lot of people kept telling me about this game it was a huge let down.

The game felt completely random, random draw, rolling of the dice. And had too much of "I play this card and all your efforts so far have been wasted".

Yes the game is full of tense decisions, but those decisions didn't feel fun at all. I was tempted multiple times just to force the DEFCON to 1 just to get it over with, but out of respect to my opponent I stuck with it until the end.

I am told that the game gets better (i.e: less random) after repeated plays and memorizing the cards and what not. But spending 4 to 5 hours multiple times while not having any fun hoping that one day the game magically becomes fun sounds more like work than a game.

This game is like Chess. I respect it. I love it's thematic design. But it's impossible to play against anyone without your exact experience. Knowing the cards in the game gives you complete dominance of the game. And the game is pretty complex to learn unless you're taught by someone who already knows it. So like Chess, you can end up in a scenario where your only opponent is someone who will crush you some 20 times before you even give them a run for their money. Which is why despite wanting to play the game and liking it, I had to get rid of it -- I was never going to get to play it.

Once you get to know the rules and familiarise yourself with the cards and history of the cold war, it becomes one of the finest boardgames you can play with someone, It abstracts the cold war's atmosphere so accurately.

The map and the components in the deluxe edition are very high quality, cards have photos of the actual historical events which add an extra layer of immersion to the fun. 

If you are into near history and want to play a very tense game of politics, this is a must have!

A good game, which I have greatly enjoyed the few times I have played it. It's long, but tense the whole way through. I'm not a fan of the Cold War theme (I lived through it and studied it in college so I've kind of had enough) so that, and the length, keep it from getting played more. I might give the computer game a try to get more play in, since the game has a reputation as needing heavy familiarity with the cards to play well.

I wonder about the amount of luck in the die rolls. I hate the idea of such a long game having so much unpredictable d6 luck. I know that committed players feel that it‚Äôs not as important as it seems, but still...

Back up to a 10 with my newest session report: soooo much better than Agricola. 

I downgraded it from a 10, the luck is just a bit too intense, but a 9.5 is still good!  Back to a 10 again! It captures a delicious decision card driven game perfectly.  Also captures the theme marvelously.  5 games and it just gets better and better. Such a perfect mix of strategy and luck. You cajole around the edges and set up your winning move, sometimes it works, some times you go down in a ball of flames.2008: FTF-5  Wargameroom-8 online at WGR, 14-16 games now and I'm still impressed at the tension, excitment, frustration, and fun this agme offers.  I will probably pass up the normal group for a game of this, it's that good. Now we need multiplayer TS groups instead of Euro groups!:)Every game I understand some of the interaction, planning, and 'pushing' that makes the game so much fun.  Ok the luck is starting to bother me. I downgraded it to a 9.5 but I still wont pass it up. It's hard enough as the US and then score cards never get dealt after I take control so it's even worse.

The game may become repetitive, but it still is a masterpiece.
The whole game focusses on political aspects and makes war a sideshow (or the ultimate nightmare).

RATING: 8
This is a really strong immersive experience that gets deeper with every play.  It's a constant struggle of crisis management, the key to which is squeezing benefits out of the cards when offered opportunities.  That said, the game can feel very claustrophopbic when the cards are against you, and that can get frustrating at times.

Of all board games of the last ten years, this may be the best entry point for serious chess players.  Fantastic game, tons of depth and seamlessly emulates the tension of the cold war.  However, -1/2 star because the learning curve is a little too intense for most of my would-be opponents.  However, don't let that put you off if you have a lot of strategically inclined friends or belong to a chess club or something.  With the right opponent, this game is incredible.

RATING: 8
A Very Good Game that's probably deserving of its rank (currently) at #1 overall.

But I suck at it. Massively.

Normally that's all the motivation I need to improve my play and hence get it to the table more often. But there's something painful about not doing well at TS that leads me to avoid playing it more often. And since my ratings are now about my subjective enjoyment of a given title instead of a game's absolute worth, it's going to stay at at 8 for now. If I do better and can make it through a match without bitching, moaning, and crying -- I'm really quite pathetic -- then I'm sure the rating will go up as it properly deserves.

RATING: 9.5
This is an awsome, awsome game!

In each turn of every round (and there could be 7x10=70 turns in a game), the player is faced with a series of hard decisions: Should i play a card from my side or should i keep it in the deck to use it later to a better efect? Should i instead play a card from the opposite side so that i can "burn" that event before it can gets even worse for my side?
Events that do happen are then discarded, but those who don't are reshuffled into the deck and can happen in one of the next rounds of the same historic period, a brilliant concept!
Also, at every time during the game, the player must take prevention steps so that he is not forced to launch a nuclear war, a reason to lose the game on the spot! - this is the reason because players new to the game can lose it very fast, it's vital to have some knowledge about the cards but, after 3 or 4 games, things began to make sense and become easier, as the game's mechanics are not really heavy. What makes the game really hard and interesting is the permanent need for a wise decision about the choice between lesser evils!
A complete recreation of the events that spanned over 40 years of the XX century (which i witness the last 12) develops under the finger tips of both players, with the great ideia that, in each game, only a fraction of the 110 possible events do happen, and are the players who define which do happen or not, remaking history and making all games different!

Excellent design.  I may be biased, as I have a degree in political science, so I was a student of the cold war.  There are a dearth of games on this subject, but even if there were more, I don't think my opinion would change.  I like CDGs, and I really like how events are triggered if you play your opponent's events for Ops.  This feature really helps balance things out with the unified deck.  The sapce race is an interesting mechanism to get rid of events that benefit your opponent.  US has a higher learning curve than the USSR, so let the new guy play the commies.

This is by FAR the best 2 player game I have ever encountered. At first it seems similar to Risk, but it is much, much more interesting. Each round there are many options for what actions to take, but there is no obvious path to victory. This is truy a game that matches your wits against your opponents' in a way that relies very little on chance. The learning curve is quite large however because it is imperative that you and your opponent know all of the cards in the game.

This game is just OK.  The biggest issue (and same issue I have with Labyrinth) is that if you haven't played it much you don't know what to do because there are so many different cards that effect the game - if you don't know what all of them are, it's tough to plan a strategy.  One of those games I'll bring out every 3-4 years and play once or twice and then put away.  That's the problem - I don't have the time to devote what is required to maximize the enjoyment.  Just too many other games I'd like to get on the table.

Twilight Struggle is still a fantastic game after about a year of playing it. Understanding the history of the cold war ties nicely into the cards and basic actions the players should be making each turn. There is a slight luck element but the rest is all reaction to your opponent. My only complaint is the difficulty getting the game to the table since it's pretty much the only game we can play in an evening. This is a game that will remain in the collection for the long term.

[6 Oct 2017] - 8.25 (6 plays)
I still think this is an excellent 2 player game where much of the time you spend trying to get inside the head of your opponent while counting the cards in the deck to determine the least bad option for you to take. I find the theme incredibly interesting and the flow of the game makes sense after a couple of plays. The length gives the game that epic feel but also makes it harder to play now that I have a busy schedule.

What a great game. So much thought has gone into its design; mixing in the mid and late war decks changes the mood of the game as you play through it, and the fact that you are forced to play opponents events if using 'their' cards for operations means that you are never completely in control.  Hand management and strategic influence counter placement are other factors adding to its richness and complexity. The mechanics themselves are light, and it is easy to learn in an afternoon. I see us playing this a lot in 2008. I also like  the fact that it is non-expandable. Hurrah!

RATING: 7
Deep and challeging card based game that moves through the various phases of the cold war between U.S. and U.S.S.R. Has all the tough choices of a serious wargame with the chaotic element of randomly drawn events. That said, it is not a true war game because everything is fully abstracted so no troop movement and such. It also has a fairly high amount of luck, if that bothers you.

Fun game that really gets you into a Cold War mindset.  Very tense  with lots of choices and that classic CDG feeling that you can never do all that you want to do.  The event cards are also a gas to read. I'm not sure, however, that I will want to play it over and over again because I could see the game play getting somewhat stale over many plays--there's only so much you can do and the card distribution is so chaotic that you spend most of the time reacting to the other guy and fighting your hand.

What a delightful two-player game!  I had been looking forward to playing it based on buzz but wasn't sure I'd like it, given that I'm not really a wargamer and I don't appreciate the cold war theme as much as others (esp. male others) do. But, I was very happy with the game. My first game went really long (10pm - 3am) but there was really very little downtime and it was very engaging with lots of choices. Sure, there is luck but it isn't overwhelming.  I've heard rumors that it is difficult to win as the U.S. but I managed my first time so it is obviously possible.  I ordered this game as soon as I got home from the Gathering.

Very tense 2 player game. Most time you struggle for insignificant avantages, but they will do the difference.
It's my type of game, but I think it's too overrated on BGG; January 2011; 1 rank for wargame AND boardgame,2 rank on strategy games... It's not the ultimate game it's just an excellent game. 
The effect cards are not so balanced, dice rollings could be frustating, space race is pure randomness.
I love the historic background which reminds my childhood, I love the go feeling, I love to manage the uncertainty, I love the China card, I love to have yto occur negative effects when a card is played for Op. Points.
But I highly suspect than between 2 equal players, the winner will be decided by random. It's  happen to me, I won but my opponent could be the winner with my cards and dice luck.
I will remains a very enjoyable game for me.

I should have went with my gut instinct on this one. Prepare for rant.

Even after watching gameplay videos and reading multiple reviews of the game, Twilight Struggle just didn't look like any fun. But it kept gnawing at me... it's #1 on BGG; there has to be a reason. There has to be more to it than it seems.

Well, there really isn't. We've played twice now, plus one learning game where we stopped early.

Here are the things I was sure I wouldn't like (and I didn't):

- The area control mechanic. This isn't a favorite of mine by a long shot, but there are definitely some area control games I love (for example, Dominant Species). This one's area control is little more than the old Risk I-push-a-little-here-you-push-a-little-there. Some people love this, but my wife and I find it really boring.

- The theme. I grew up in the 1970s in the US, so I'm well aware of the feelings of the time (fear of nuclear war, political uncertainty, etc.). I have never been particularly interested in politics, war or military history... and this game did nothing to make the subject matter compelling for someone like me. Other games have succeeded in "swaying" me to their theme (for example, Loyang), but Twilight Struggle was direly uninteresting thematically. My wife has even less interest in politics and history than I do (she doesn't even read/watch the news), so you can guess her interest in the theme.

Here are the things I thought maybe I'd like (but I didn't):

- The Space Race. In the game, this is just a way to throw away one card per turn (sometimes two) and make a die roll for possible VPs and/or special powers. The amount of randomness there is really surprising (for the #1 BGG game). Flip a coin, maybe you advance and get points, maybe you don't.

- The cards. I knew that this game would stand or fall based on the cards. Well, the majority of them are simply "add 2 influence in XYZ country or remove 2 influence from ABC country" or else, "this round get +1 for this-that-the-other" or "your opponent gets -1 for this-that-the-other". I'm not a fan of most card games for this reason... but there are exceptions (like Innovation, which has excellent and unique card ideas).

Here are some things I didn't realize (and then didn't like):

- The scoring. It's basically just majorities... play a scoring card for a region, see who has more territories. (Some other cards and the Space Race offer some points, but boring old region majority scoring is the main scoring.)

- The luck. There's a lot of single-d6 die rolling. I roll, you roll... oh look, I just won the Olympics and got 2 points! Really? This is the top game on BGG?

There are some things I have mixed feelings about:

- The cardplay. This, I think, is the one thing the game has going for it. I never had a single hand I felt was "really good". My wife also felt that the majority of her hands were not great. So, this game seems generally to be about mitigating the disaster better than the other player (and, yes, this does fit the theme). You need to find ways to play your cards in the best order possible, adapting to what your opponent plays, so that the cards which help your opponent the most come out when they are the least helpful (or occasionally have no effect). There is definitely an opportunity for strategy here and some interesting decisions... BUT... that's nowhere near enough to save the game for us.

Meh.

Played over Christmas 2009.  Wonderful game, great components, perfectly balanced, I can see why it is #1.  I held off on buying this one because it seemed long and complicated.  Now that I have been exposed to more games, this game is quite straight-forward and one only really needs a quick check of the rules (like 3-5 minutes worth) to get back into it. Hannibal, Le Havre and Through the Ages are the only games I have played that may ever challenge it for top spot in my rankings. 3rd play, damn this is a great game.

- Like: 2 player game, area control is always fun, beautiful board and cards, great theme, relatively small rule set.

- Dislike: considerable luck factor, longish (3h), bothersome calculation rules for deciding the winner of "realignment rolls" and "coup attempts", big learning curve because you need to learn all the cards.

All in all it was the luck factor that made me sell Twilight Struggle. The game is too heavy and too long for the winner to be decided by chance. And yes, luck can be mitigated for a big part, but one of the players will get that small bit of extra luck in drawing and dicing, so with players of similar strength chance will decide who wins.

(2nd edition) Based on two half-playings, a lot of fun.  Every subsequent playing will be different, since knowing what the cards do will greatly affect the decisions you make (i.e., the US player shouldn't spend a lot of resources on Cuba unless it's getting towards the end of the game and he can guarantee that the Castro card won't get played).

Looks like a light wargame, but it isn't one.  It's actually a meaty Euro with a conflict theme.

RATING: 2
Rating after two plays.

A CDG that Cold War fans will enjoy and combat-averse eurogamers can get into because there are no dice and conflict is highly abstracted. The relatively short playing time is a bonus. The somewhat chaotic nature of the game is a downer, however, and eight consecutive failed attempts at the space race have jaded my opinion of this game.  Knowing all the cards and their effects in advance will give experienced players a ridiculous advantage over newbies.

The most critical problem that has been smoked out is play balance. One need not look far for reports of the Russians winning in the first three or four turns because of a good hand combined with the right scoring cards. Not fun if you're the US. Mind you, I think some of that might stem from the TS sharks, so you probably won't experience that for your first few plays while you and your friends fumble around.

And, as others have mentioned, this game is seriously overpriced for what it contains.

PS - Twilight Struggle is not a wargame.

Update: After honestly giving it many more attempts via Steam, I've had to downgrade my rating. Given competent play on both sides, it pretty much boils down to the arrival and timing of those scoring cards. Plus, it's too easy to fuck up and automatically lose the game because of the screwball rules regarding the DEFCON track, which I've decided I hate.

Kind of a 2-player El Grande with more detailed theming.

Not deep, but good honest fun.

Potentially great game that gives me pause.  Played one game and USSR dominated the entire time.  Problem is, I'm not sure how US could have fared better.  Asia is basically a loss and Europe very questionable.  USSR has the two highest value, most recurring scoring in its pocket.  As USSR, I just wasn't ever worried.  Long, not tense, decisions were easy, basically a game of "Let me slap you around for three hours".  US events kinda sucky.

Still a great game, but drops a few notches for its lengthy games. 

[August 2016 - 9.1]
There are few games where you are so intently watching your opponent such as in Twilight Struggle. From what cards they play to where they go, you're on edge every turn.

The card play mechanics take a few turns to fully grasp for someone new, but then it becomes clear and creates some tough decisions. There's some luck in the card draw, but it all usually evens out pretty well. There's a lot going on the board, but the gameplay is pretty straightforward once you learn it.

Once you learn the cards, the game takes on a new level -- "he's probably doing that because he has that card" or there's definitely double guessing going on if you suspect a scoring card is coming up.

Includes: Custom Dice

11 live plays with my brother.  100+ plays on Vassal.

This game is truly great.  I have had games where I just knew I had it in the bag and lost...and vice versa.  This game is never over until it's over.

There is luck in the game, but the good player will nearly always beat the poor player.

RATING: N/A
Key is that game is NOT balanced within individual turns, so it feels one-sided, but balanced over time. Also, much of game is tension putting out fires that opponent starts, or that are started by your own cards! Finally, the gameplay requires decisionmaking regarding how to manage your bad cards - which is an ongoing mechanic. Note that the Cold War was about futility and stalemate so this is an excellent sim of that dynamic.

The theme is wonderfully prevalent. The randomness of the cards ensures that each game will be different. A challenging way to study and learn about history. (Online)

RATING: 9
After picking up the digital version of Twilight Struggle, and playing numerous 'solo' games against the CPU, and three online games with Paul, I am upgrading its rating to a '9'.  Even once one starts to know the card deck, the game still feels tense from start to finish, and while there are some similarities across the games, no two truly feel quite the same.

Paul and I just completed our inaugural game‚Äîwhich we didn't actually finish‚Äîthis past Sunday, April 2nd. It's too early to give it a final grade, but I can certainly see Twilight Struggle going up from here. It's easy to learn, dynamic, challenging, and‚Äîabove all‚Äîfun. If I was a history teacher, I would incorporate the game into my lesson plan on the Cold War. That being said, I haven't fallen in love with it yet. "Yet" being the operative word.

You will probably like this game unless you are from Chili or The Replublic of China.  If you are teaching an art class, you will want to get this game because it comes with a free bad example of perspective and lighting, which your student may find useful.

Before you dismiss this based on the fact that I only have one recorded play, know that I don't record online/iOS plays and I have played it dozens of times there. And the more I play it the less I like it. Although I'm a child of the Cold War and appreciate the flavour, the game just isn't that fun to me or particularly fascinating. Maybe I'm just really bad at this game, but I don't see the strategic planning in it. I am honestly baffled that this game is as highly regarded as it is here on BGG. I don't really like the back and forth nature of it that often comes down to who got dealt the best cards. The game is most interesting in the early and mid war, but generally positions are pretty entrenched by the late war, so the last third of the game is static and kind of uninteresting. I can't stand the rule that can allow someone to cost you a game by triggering a nuclear war because you had to pass a card to them. I'm sorry, but that's just sloppy design. I find myself more annoyed than entertained while playing the game. I realize I'm in the minority on this one, but there is a very long list of games I would play before this one.

Rating after one play.  There's a lot going on here, and I recognize that I don't get the full flavour after one play of a game that ended in turn four, but I can at least say I would happily play it again, despite being more like a wargame than any other game I've played and rated this highly.

Here's a game I like to play with another person when everybody else leaves Game Nights when they get too tired to play.  Good 2-player strategy game.  The biggest randomness aspect of the game isn't actually the dice, when the scoring cards come into play they can determine a lot, especially in a tight game.  There are other games I enjoy to play more so I'll never get really good at this game but still a solid game.

Deluxe edition is really wonderful! As a game it is a perfect 10. But, the real problem problem is that it is long and its leaning curve (to be a good player) is really hard to climb.

A perfect 10.  Being card-driven, no two plays of this game are alike.  It's got a great theme, which is beautifully and realistically played out.  I love all the ways it mirrors the real cold war.  You're always trying to mislead your opponent while figuring out what he/she is up to.  The only negative thing I have to say about this game is that it's hard for newbies to win against experienced players who know the cards already.

Bottom line, if you are looking for a 2-player game to add to your collection: get Twilight Struggle.

RATING: 6
[More than 5 plays on-line]

This game is hard to rate. At first it's awesome, so many options, act and react and all that but after a while it becomes a game of frustration. You get frustrated when you flunk your third space race roll in a row while your opponents make all theirs and captures a Nazi scientist on the way as well. You also get frustrated when you fail all your war rolls, roll "1" on all realignment/coups and so on. I know it should even out after a while but I still feel the game is too random to really portrait the Cold War. I'll gladly play it, but I won't take it seriously which perhaps was the intention of the game all along?

Update: The more I play it the more I dislike it. It's truly just a game of suck management where if you draw the right cards you win. Who needs planning? 

Update 2: Perhaps not really that bad so upped the rating somewhat again.

Update 3: Yes, it is that bad or perhaps even worse?

Update 4: If you take it for what it is, a light game with lots of luck it's all right and actually fun. Just don't do what I did and take it too seriously.

Quite interesting idea, board and tokens are good quality. Mechanism is also quite simple and easy to understand - however it does not mean it is easy to play.

I've been wanting to play this for a long time.  Finally broke down and bought it and am really enjoying it.  It is mostly an area-influence game, but is much more thematic than traditional area-inf games like El Grande.  It can be a little "tit for tat", but there is a good mechnism in place to discourage one player from  shadowing his opponent's influence placemnt.  I'm not a fan of the "Wargames" card.  It should be mentioned in the rulebook so that 2 newbies will know, ahead of time, it is in the deck...and be prepared when turn 8 arrives.  It's basically a "kill card" that ends the game immediately under certain conditions.

All in all TS is a fairly simple CDW to learn and play.  Not as good as some others I've played but still excellent.  Starting at a 9.

Downgrading from 9 to 7.  As suspected, it is just too much "tit-for-tat".  One player ends up shadowing the other players moves.  The problem gets worse in the late war when most of the countries are controlled and the Defcon remains at 2 (except for USSR first action).  Still a fun game that I like to play, but there are much better wargames out there.

RATING: 9
Twilight Struggle is in a class by itself, a crossover powerhouse that combines event and operations card driven wargame action with tense eurogame-style area control. The game is saturated in tension, as you must constantly balance attempts to advance your own position with efforts to stop your opponents advancement, without ever being quite sure what sort of nasty tricks that your opponent will be able to pull out of their hat. The fact that your opponent's events will trigger if you play them only adds to the tension, as you have to think about mitigating their impact on your position as much as you have to worry about what your opponent is going to do.

The game's depth is a thing of wonder, with each decision having an immense impact on what will occur as the game progresses and areas of the board being constrained more by the question of "When do I want to go into this area?" rather than "Why would I want to go into this area?" (though there are admittadly a few of those too). 

The games flaws are mostly in the form of the imbalances between the relative power levels of the Soviets and the USA. Despite this, the more experienced player should usually win, its just it is more dangerous to be the USA player.

A card driven game where players try to exert their political doctrine across the globe.  A very similar game to We The People, without the armies there to reinforce your politics.  Some luck involved in the shuffling of the score cards into the decks.  I like the rules that force opponents events to trigger if YOU use the card for operations - this can lead to some hard thinking about what to play and what to junk on the Space Race.    My beefs are trying to determine level of control during scoring (and play) - I've plugged some spare red/blue cubes into the game to indicate control at a glance - makes the game situation much clearer to see at a glance.  The game can run a bit long too.

After revisiting the game in 2016, after an 8 year break, the game still feels too long, same-y (they got the struggle part right), unforgiving, and too often decided by factors beyond reasonable control.   This is essentially a three hour area majority game (this is not a wargame), and games have to be very, very good to get my interest for three hours.  The rule giving your opponent a cheesy win by allowing them to trigger a nuclear war on your turn after a couple of  hours of careful play is "interesting".  Happy to put this one behind me for good.

In my mind, Twilight Struggle was, for a long time, placed on a pedestal as some sort of gaming icon. Sure I'd played Labyrinth, but this was The Big One. The grandaddy of them all. #1 on BGG.

Months now after I've bought it and played it a few times, it's not the end-all-be-all I had made it out to be, but it is a great game, and I've had fun teaching and playing it with friends.

My only real problems with it are that, to be any better than novice at this game, you have to know the decks inside and out, and have a good understanding about when discards are coming up. This metagaming is fine, but it sort of takes me out of the spirit of the game by shifting the focus from the events and consequences of operations to hand management and card counting.

Still, like I said, great game that I'll almost always play.

I can see why some people really love this game, but those people must have more free time than I do. The 3 hour play time is not accurate for new players. After my first two plays, we were only half way done after 3 hours. I actually haven't finished a game yet because of the length. That being said, I enjoyed playing this. The mechanics work, and the theme really comes through. My only complaint is with the dice rolling. I'm fine with dice rolling in general, but rolling just one die is frustrating. When I roll three 1's in a row, I really feel like bad luck is defeating a good strategy. I think more dice would help average out the bad rolls.

Decent game, but clearly was released unbalanced as pro-Soviet.  Designers have made some progress in accepting that, as has the game's enthusiasts, in general.  However, too many editions have been released, old versions need update kits, and even newer cards issues (good marketing, but bad for people that buy editions 1, 2 and 3) that also add to the Pro-Soviet edge.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a great game of cold-war intrigue and manipulation. The game has many clever additions to the popular card-driven genre [aka 'We The People' series games]. It plays more like a two-player majority game than a GMT wargame. I am a little concerned about how much of the game could hinge on burying opponents good cards and cycling yours, but it will take a lot a fun games before the jury comes back with that verdict. Exciting to see a new designer create such an instant classic!On a side note, the typos and blatant errors in this game are apalling. No part of the game got printed without mistakes; the map, the game cards, the play aids, and even the rulebook all have errors. Was there a single editor, developer, or even a proofreader? 'Replublic of China'? Different scoring rules on the play aid versus the rule book? I'm patient enough to play a friend's copy for three years and buy the inevitable reprint rather than pay $60 for an error-riddled production.

RATING: 9.5
This can be an amazing experience if you enjoy the theme and this type of game.  The events, actions available, and randomness all mirror much of the tension and futility of the actual cold war.  The flip side to this is a steep learning curve and the frustrating nature of dice rolls and card draws which can make the game feel daunting at first.  However, this game rewards repeated plays and win or lose will have you thinking about the things you did wrong and what a better strategy would be in the future.  I think the luck element actually adds to the tension and theme in a positive way.  I love the pictures from historical events on the cards and the way the map reduces the fate of the world to pairs of corresponding numbers.  It turns world changing events into digestible values and subsequently makes your opponent's wooden "2" chit next to yours very meaningful.

-.5   For minor gripes such as the way the turn track is implemented and the use of nondescript tokens to track important events.

This area control card game does a great job of capturing the tension of the cold war.  Tough choices on many of the cards: do I use the action points or the event?

Not a collector's copy.  A little box wear, but otherwise good condition. Includes printout of 2nd edition rules and printout of FAQ/errata. Nice quality paste-up corrections to the game board to correct various errors of the 1st edition. Similarly, some game cards have appropriate edits written on them to update to current edition or correct errors. All corrections tastefully done in my opinion and facilitate easy play of the game as it should be played. Game materials are in very good condition although the game has been played a number of times. The two six sided dice I have with the game are not the originals.

I see how this could be good game, but my two gameplays (one 4-hour and one 5-hour to get only half way through each time) have not evidenced that.  I feel like most would  need an experienced player to show them the ropes to get a good grasp without struggling through their first plays.  Out of good faith, I'm giving this a 6 even though my experience was a 4.

Perhaps this game would benefit from a tutorial variant where only one continent is played.

Very neat game.  My first card-driven wargame.  Not sure if it's going to hit the table that often with such a long play time, but certainly an enjoyable and tense affair.  After 3 plays, I think that with all the rolls, the dice usually balance out.  The bigger luck factor comes from the cards you draw.  The guy who draws all the big cards has a significant advantage in my opinion, but maybe that's just because I haven't played this enough.  1960 has a very nice mechanic to balance this out.

4 on the Cindometer

The best game in my collection. Oozes with theme. Non-symetrical, strategic and tactic at the same time. You must constantly think about the big picture but adapt your actions on the fly. Great production value and endless replayability. Up to 3-4 hours gameplay, thus hard to get to the table but when does is always a blast.

RATING: 9
Outstanding 2-player game that provides a very intense experience.   The game presents you with a relentless tug-of-war of agonizing choices.  It's subtle and reveals itself slowly, also, as you get to know the cards and how to manipulate them.  Very clever implementation, and a great hard-thinking game.  Like War Of The Ring, it's a very theme-heavy wargame.

Gets better every time I play it. Now if only I had people to play it with... (this problem may be solved.)

Update: After over 25 plays, I think I might be close to "done" with this one - but that's a lot of play, and I have loved the ride. I seem to have plateaued in terms of learning and ability, but the amount of depth and intricacy in this design is fantastic, and it's very much inspired me to go out and play other CDGs.

Brilliant game. The downsides for it are more specific to me and my play habit - Two player games don't get played, especially two player games that take a few sessions to learn. Once you learn though the rules are really quite easy. It captures the theme of the period, the intrigue and bluffing, the desire to do more than realistically possible. It is a game that I really wish I could play more but until I find a two player game partner I never will.

I'd say 1960 has more interesting card play, and Twilight Struggle has more interesting board/spatial positioning play. Also, I prefer the rest cubes over the dice in Twilight Struggle, and the debate over the space race.

This looks like it is going to be another one of those games that I will recognize as a spectacular game, but won't ever be a game that I really, really like.

Perhaps I'll be proven wrong after more plays.

RATING: 10
Awesome game with very high re-playability - no 2 games follow the same pattern due to the almost infinite variables introduced by the card draw/play. While strategies take a while to master, the basic rules are not complex or difficult to comprehend, so it is quite accessible for novice players. I have not played a game that went longer than 7-8 hours (4 or 5 is more typical), so you can complete a game in a single sitting. 

I own the Deluxe Edition. The game components are absolutely top quality - just from the visuals, the game begs you to play it.

RATING: 5
TS is one of those games that I'll play on rare occasions.  It's not [i]bad[/i], in fact I enjoy a number of parts of it as well as the overall feel.  There's just too many things it does that irritate me, and as long as its sister games are around, I'd rather play one of them.  I might play it more frequently despite this if A it wasn't 2 player only (2p games just happen less often) and B it didn't take so darn long.

Having finally played a few card-driven games, I've come to enjoy this style pretty well.  I like the tension of deciding how best to use each card, each hand.  I like the headline phase in the beginning, the space race track, the pseudo-deckbuilding element as you try to weed out your opponent's powerful events when they'll be least useful.  The area majority core is set up a little strangely, but still totally understandable.  Even the scoring cards, which can be a kind of wrench in things by showing up at random, I don't have a problem with.  So long as you know what's coming & what's already happened, you know where to focus your attention.

Where TS loses me is in most of the rest of the game systems.  First off, the defcon track.  This thing may be thematic, but it's also a huge pain.  It feels like a major portion of the game is just managing this one element and trying to make sure you get the first turn when it's low enough for you to pull off the move you want.  Having to remember these bizarre restrictions about where you can and can't do these particular actions is always a nuisance.  And that's before you get to the fact that you can end the game prematurely by forcing your opponent to push it to 0.  I find this both anti-thematic and un-fun, and dislike that rule intensely.

The military ops track is another piece of chrome that I think could've stood to be cut.  I never remember to try and meet that requirement, most of the time you exceed it w/out even trying, and it seems to serve only to encourage you to do coups even more than you ordinarily would (more on that below).  I just have no idea why it's even there.

Lastly, though, is the big thing: the action balance.  I've played this one several times with the experienced players, the ones who do this every week.  Now, you can do 4 things with a card.  You can attempt a coup or do a realignment, using the die.   You can play the event, or you can just use it to put out influence.  The people who know what they're doing seem to stick with just 2 of those: coups and events.  Events are self-explanatory, if those are good you'll want to use 'em.  But it really feels to me like you want to be using coups at every opportunity, as they're just stronger than the other 2 options.  Realignments sound cool, but I've rarely seen them be useful.  It would be one thing if coups were locked off by defcon restrictions, but the weaker realignments weren't, but as it is, there's not much reason to use them.  Placing out influence is likewise fine, but a very expensive way to break up control, limited by adjacency so you can't always reach the spot you want, and then the next turn your opponent can come along and stage a coup, undoing all your work.  

In the end, it's this repetitive feeling of how the game [i]plays[/i] (plus the general clunkiness and length) that really gets to me, and makes me wish I were playing something else.

There are so many fans of this game that there is little point in me telling the world how disappointed I was.  Expectations are built up from a number one position on BGG.  But I was surprised to find a fairly basic area-control game with the scoring determined by random card draws.  It was OK but I sold my copy immediately as that is all it was to  me.  
It reminded me a little of [thing=128780][/thing], but not nearly as entertaining or as interesting.

THE game. No wait, that is GO, but this is a close second. 1st place on BGG for years for a reason.

The first time I played it I said "this is what I always dreamed Risk should be.. and I thought my dream was too grand!". 

Choose between URSS and USA, throw yourself in 1947, and let the world be your playground. 
Use coups d'etat, spread influence around the globe, take advantage of historical figures, or minimise strategically the negative impact they bring on your superpower. 

But keep the balance and don't push too much or nuclear warfare will ensue, and you'll loose.
It's only for TWO players. Two Serious players.

I love the theme, and i love the back and forth play and the way the focus shifts around the board. My main issue with this game is that the Russians do have a strong advantage. I've never seen the USA win before the last turn or two, I've seen the Russians win on turn 4 or 5 several times. If it weren't so popular it might see a second edition that re balances the early war cards a little. I know you can bid for the right to play russia but my gaming friends like to play the rules as written. Also whilst i quite like long games, this over stays its welcome a little. There's a period in the mid to late game that feels a bit redundant.

What can I say about it that hasn't been said before?
Is it a good game? Yes without any doubt. Is it the best boardgame ever? My opinion... No

First of all, I'm not a big fan of card driven games. There are a few which I like very much (like hannibal) and a few that I would call decent (like Twilight struggle). Most of them, I just don't play at all.

One thing that I don't like about card driven games is that knowing the deck is a big advantage and this is very true for twilight struggle. When playing against an even skilled opponent, this doesn't matter though.

Still a very decent game that you should have least tried once in your boardgaming life

I really like this one, although dice and cards can be a real pain in the.. bottom.

Anyway I recommend this one.

Twilight Struggle is a Battle Card Driven game. It was the first time I played this type of game.

It is a pretty different type of game than what I am use to play. It was a pleasent surprise. If I play more of these kind of games to have a better feel of the mechanic, rating might go up.

Update: I really want to enjoy this game, but I played a little more, and I find it's not really my kind of game. It's an area contol mechanic with a wargame theme. I generally like area control, but am really not a wargamer. Not fond of the card driven mechanic.

One of my favorite games, with the obvious limitation that it only allows for two players. 

That being said, there are also a couple of cards in the game (frequent players of the game will know which two these are) that I find are completely based on the chance of a die roll, and if the die consistently doesn't go your way, can literally lose you the game from the one card being played. I ripped those two cards up and threw them away, as they are not, in my opinion, needed in the game. I think it's a much better game without them.

It's an okay game.  I definitely prefer 1960: The Making of the President.  TS doesn't have that big fun payoff that you like longer games to have.  The quality of the components are pretty bad.  The flimsy board needs to be laminated or set under a paperweight to stay straight, and the little sadsack cardboard chits are like something out of 1980s board gaming.  That definitely brings this game's rating down a little.

Superb!  Solid game, solid rules, solid design.  Truly recreates the feel of the Cold War.  Absolutely nails its goals.  It unfortunately suffers from wargame-quality components, but the surpassing excellence of the game transcends whatever disadvantage this might cause.  One criticism is the randomness -- too many things come down to 1d6 vs. 1d6.  I'd rather roll 3d6 and pick the median, but I haven't played with this yet.

Overall, a phenomenal example of simple rules combining with stellar board and card design to produce amazing complex and agonizing decisions.  Gets better with every play.

RATING: 10
Since the end of 2014, I have had an increasing interest in board gaming, specifically modern board games. This has blossomed into a fully fledged love for the hobby.

I have discovered many new games. Many average. Many fair. Some good. A few very good - yeah, so it's pretty much a regular bell curve. Fewer are exceptional. Five are beyond exceptional. Of those five, four of those I wouldn't find it too hard to describe the game, or the personal appeal. The fifth game is enigmatic and nebulous, and it might just be the best of all. Its name: Twilight Struggle.

I shouldn't like this game. It's a two-player game about the Cold War, and it typically takes 3 or 4 hours to play, sometimes even longer. These are not things that have particularly appealed to me in the past. I'm not the greatest fan of two-player games, or conflict games, although there are games that are exceptions to this. But really, I have never liked long games (especially those with lots of down-time); I have always preferred to play a number of shorter games instead.

Twilight Struggle is a depth-gaming game. What do I mean by this? Well, it is not a game that is necessarily easy to understand the first time you play. The mechanics and strategy aren't immediately apparent. Even before the first play, it becomes evident that this is a game that requires multiple plays to comprehend, to improve at, to master. Mistakes will be made the first time you play - it is entirely possible that you will accidentally initiate a nuclear war. It is a game that is designed to be played over and over, to explore the depths of the strategy therein.

"Oh", I thought. "A complex, heavy, two-player only game that requires not only to invest multiple hours, but many multiple times". What is more, I had heard that experience gives a stark advantage - a player of 5 games experience, for example, would have an big advantage over a new player, so they say. True of most games, of course, but particularly true of this, it seemed. So I also had to find an opponent of a similar skill level. It seemed like an investment to even get to know what was surely a niche game (how often was I really going to play a long, two-player Cold War game anyway).

Then, one day, I played my first game. 

What I didn't do, what I recommend doing, is becoming as familiar as possible with the game's mechanics beforehand. There are YouTube videos and a Steam version (which is very good) which can help immensely in that regard. That first game took a long time, a very, very long time. This was mostly my fault because I wanted to play well, and I didn't understand anything, and I wanted to understand everything. I was extremely challenged (and probably a pain in the ass). But I enjoyed it, apart from struggling with the mechanics. (Thanks Matt.)

Later, I got the Steam version, and played against the AI a bit, and got my head around the basic mechanics of the game some more. I read up on some strategy. I played have played the game twice more, over the board. And that brings me up to now.

Yes, it was an investment, and it continues to be. I think about this game, I talk about it, I want to play it. It is like no other game that I have played. It has emergent strategy; it has tactics. It has spatial management; it has bluffing. It has crisis management, oh boy, does it have crisis management. I want to plunge into the depth of it and wade there. It has rolling dice, and rolling dice is one of the best things about it. Really. I never thought I'd say that. I hate it, and I love it, because it's great to plan, but you never really know. Risk lies at the core of it all, of everything.

Not all of the games I like have a lot of player interaction. This game simmers in it. Is the opponent holding what they are representing? The decisions, the constant unenviable decisions of which it is impossible to fully know the ramifications. Do I benefit my opponent now, but thereby remove that card from the game and manage future risk? Oh, I drew a handful of my opponents cards - I have to help them out, but maybe I can conspire to help them out at least opportune time imaginable. Do I attempt to hold onto the card they need, and risk being forced to play it when I didn't want to? Do I play my own card for the ops or the event? I really need both. And so on, and on. Hours pass, and what a wonderful way to spend your time. Yeah, turns out there's a reason it was #1 for a long, long time.

In summary: it is okay

I especially like that many of the cards you have to play will benefit your opponent maybe MORE than they benefit you.

Card driven strategy game, with a cold war theme that works really well. Players manage hands of cards, some of which can be valuable to opponents, most of which must be played regardless. The game plays out in a surprisingly different manner each time, but experienced play will make the best of card play and operation tactics and usually end the game in the mid war. An amazing feat, must be played a few times by anyone with a thirst for strategy.

90-120m with 2 experienced players. 50+ plays.

This beautifully captures the flavor of the Cold War.  I often find myself second-guessing my opponent's intentions.  There's a psychological element that feels very authentic.  Talk about agonizing decisions, try playing a hand filled with your opponent's events.  There's nothing more satisfying than finding a way to make the most of a bad hand.  3-7

Just played it once and it is an incredible game. The way the mechanics work, how the game re-balances itself as it goes on is pure genius. Also, the theme integration is unbelievable. This game IS the Cold War. Too bad it takes so long to play a game or I would surely have this in my collection.

Played a friend/housemate's copy religiously for about a year, back in 2011-12. It's fair to say we became pretty obsessed. Also, I found it pretty good solo. Felt that the Soviet side had a definite advantage by always having the initiative, so we gave the US player 10 points at the outset, as well as making the Soviets play to get the China Card in play.
Great fun, really challenging, esp as the US player.

What to say, what to say?  For full disclosure, I am talking about the games Deluxe Edition.  So, what's to like about this?

1) Tension!  This game has it in spades.  

2) Low set-up breakdown time

3) A low amount of downtime between players turns

What is this game?  Some would argue that it's a war game, however, the fact that it has VP some VP's are awarded through area majority some would say this is a euro.  Who cares what it is, just play the game and see if you enjoy it.

Let's talk about the games card driven mechanism since it's the heart of the game.  Throughout each turn of the game (there are a maximum of 10) each player will have 8 - 9 cards and will be required play the majority of them.  Each non-scoring card will be associated with you, your opponent, or it will be neutral.  When you play a card, it can be done as either an event or used for it's point value.  So, why would you play cards associated with your opponent as an event?  Well, you wouldn't in normal circumstances, but the rules state that when you play cards associated with your opponent for the point value, the event will trigger regardless.  Some events when triggered will be removed from the game permanently.  This makes things very tricky.  So how do you get out of playing nasty opponent events that are in your hand?  You can typically carry one card into the next round and once (sometimes twice per round) you can chuck a card towards the space race to avoid opponents events triggering but this means that your opponent might get it when the discard pile gets shuffled to become the new deck.  So, players will be forced to decide what to play, how to play, what to get rid of and what to hold.  Tension!

Out of the box there is a definite USSR bias especially in the first 1 - 4 turns but there are a few variants to try and negate it.  If you want to have a satisfying Twilight Struggle experience, I would recommend using the optional cards and the Chinese Civil War variant for the first 10 or so games.  After that, the optional cards alone should be a sufficient once the American learning curve has been completed.

So what would I say is the games weakness?  Well, the dice makes me feel as if luck can heavily swing the results of a game.  There is a fair amount of die rolling and while it does create tension sometimes it can be annoying when you roll high on the space race and low on everything else.  For once the die rolling randomness is less of an issue to me than the card randomness, and that's because inciting a die roll can have ulterior motives (ie lowering defcon, chucking unwanted cards to the space race, increasing required military ops) than simply trying to get the result of a good die roll.

Speaking of the cards there definitely seems to be a lot of luck in who get's what cards.  Particularly the scoring cards.  Who draws what scoring card, in what order and based on the current board position can have a huge effect on the outcome of the game.  While there is randomness in the dice and cards it doesn't detract from having a highly engaging confrontational experience. 

I no longer own it as I'd much rather play online via Steam.

RATING: 9
Rating has climbed a bit after more and also after playing other games that fall into the same wheelhouse. The rules for this are actually only eight pages. Everything is balanced very tightly, which I have found a difficult task for other games in this genre. There is chrome here, but not too much. Some games of this type tend to add fiddly mini-games to increase the chrome. TS does not require such mechanisms, and that may be its best feature.

A great new entry in the long row of wargame-reviving card driven wargames. This one plays quick, is easy to teach to anybody (even non-wargamers), has lots of flair, and takes a lot of clever thinking to master. The freshness of the theme and the very balanced approach of the authors to the themes represented (critical to both Soviet and US historical power plays) makes this a real must have for any enthusiast of card-driven wargames or "epic" 2 player games in general. Be prepared for some frustrating plays as the US, though - one has to know the game well to play the US right, as the Soviets have more powerful events in general.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Games not bad, but not great? 

No idea why it's number 1? But still exploring it.

I agree with others that the game plays you as much as you do it!

Seems to lack a lot of strategy as you've not many choices and can't keep cards. Your main choice is when to play cards, which to use on the space race, and if your own nation/neutral cards, whether to go for event or influence. 

You can place influence, or take a dice roll to see if something good happens - this D6 roll can make a large difference! Which makes it a risk - especially when you're playing it and giving your opponent an event.

And I finally get why card knowledge helps - eg Cuba card means the US tokens are removed, and replaced with USSR to control. So an experienced player would NEVER put tokens in Cuba, till the card is gone! This knowledge can change a lot of the game play.

Maybe USSR has some better cards? Certainly seems that way (but I am currently US) as one of my 4 pointers 'gave me japan', which I already had, so my opponent got 4 points for nothing! Meanwhile I play a card as I have to, to give her access to S.America and Africa!

Seems to take a lot longer than the 3 hours, at least to start with. I have seen others say 3 hours is an average time. I guess if you know the cards and don't have to read them, it would be a lot quicker!

----

First game USSR won turn 4 on VP.

----

Second game looks equal-ish - we both think the opponent is better placed to win. US has VP, USSR has space race (6 turns and not a single die success for US! Still on starting square!) We're both a little over it, seems to drag on and on. Been two evenings and not done yet. Estimating 4-6 hours played so far and just on turn 7/8!

SOLD IT

I'm a huge fan of 1960, which is why I had to buy this game. Sadly I just could not get into it.

I must come to terms with the fact that I generally have never like games with dozens of cardboard chits; they are too fussy to use. Having 3 different ways to place influence seemed redundant.

Though not influencing my rating, half the chits in my new copy of the game needed to be glued (as they fell apart when punched out).

I's sticking with 1960.

RATING: 9
Probably the best board-based, card game ever.  Why? Because there are two different asymetric player cards which are almost perfectly balanced (perhaps West is favoured before removing the Shah of Iran card).  Add in an excellently done, tense theme where you fear falling behind in the space race or inadvertently triggering nuclear armageddon.  Incredibily intelligent and well-applied design and theming.  How ever many reissues and copycats have comeout, this remains the pinnacle - and alone kicked off the trail of Cold War card games. Relatively easy to teach and after a learning game, the impact of the 'knowing the deck' shouldn't factor in anymore, so disregard that unfounded criticism (which sounds to me like playing a game of poker and being surprised that aces are high).  It may not be the easiest game to learn directly from the rulebook and my main knock is that the scoring cards appearance can be just luck, but barring that, it's sheer elegance once the lightbulb switches on.  Almost perfection and worthy of its many accolades.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Fantastic back and forth. You constantly struggle with whether or not to play cards that help your opponent more than they help you. One of the most tense games I have ever played. Fairly easy to learn and teach, and the rulebook is fantastic as many GMT rulebooks are.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The board, counters and cards are visually appealing.  Rules medium length, well written, but marred by a few ambiguities (primarily with respect to special card effects). 

Gameplay often feels reactive rather than deliberate, and it can be difficult to plan and carry out a strategy because of the exigencies of events.  While this inability to make long term plans may render the game an accurate simulation of international power politics during the Cold War, it also robs the game of that certain satisfaction that arises from a well-orchestrated campaign. There is room for clever card play, but players seem to spend as much time trying to avoid the play of cards that might help the opponent as they do playing cards for their own advantage. 

The order of card draws as well as a player's success or failure in particular die rolls can sometimes have a profound effect on the course of the game, and players have little ability to manage their risks. Luck seems to play a bit too large a part in the game for my taste. 

This game's strong point is theme - Twilight Struggle is steeped in history. Conclusion: recommended for players interested in Cold War history and untroubled by the substantial role that luck plays in the game.

RATING: 8
Wonderful tug-o-war style game, where Risk meets politics. After a few plays, it becomes a bit too chess-like (as players become more familiar with the cards) and I wish there was a way to make each playthrough distinctly different (removal of random cards, slightly more random starting influence, etc). For the same reason, the game is very exclusive as it tends to force new players out, since they won't have the knowledge of more experienced players. However, if you find the right friend for this game you might not ever put it back in the box. I desperately wish that I could find that friend.

I don't actually think TS is a great game. I can think of a dozen other two players I would play before this one (7 Wonders Duel, Patchwork, Star Realms)...

But I am a Cold War buff. I love delving into the history, and I have a friend who is as much of one as I am. We like playing this game... but mostly we like the history.

Really though, the cards mess up Area-Control strategies. I have to differ from the rest of the BGG community. I find it interesting, but very flawed.

Fant√É¬°stico War-Game que recrea las situaciones de la Guerra Fr√É¬≠a y la carrera armamentistica entre URSS y EEUU.
El juego es espectacular que representa estupendamente √É¬©sa √É¬©poca.Hay diferentes formas de ganar: haciendo que el rival llegue a provocar la guerra nuclear, o llegando a 20 puntos de victoria, o sino el que m√É¬°s puntos tenga al final del d√É¬©cimo turno.
Es un juego muy completo y para ganar podremos seguir much√É¬≠simas estrategias diferentes; hay que explotar las cartas de Scoring, pero no hay que descuidar la "Carrera Espacial" y hay que optimizar el uso de Golpes de Estado y las refriegas internas
Tiene 3 inconvenientes: Muy largo (en realidad no es inconveniente, pero debemos de disponer de al menos 4 horitas para poder jugar; pero el juego no se hace largo); Es s√É¬≥lo para 2 personas; El acabado del juego es regular: las fichitas son cutres y el tablero es de calidad manifiestamente mejorable. Para lo caro que es podr√É¬≠an haberse currado m√É¬°s las calidades, otra opci√É¬≥n es que lo hubieran subido 2 euros de precio y usar cartones de m√É¬°s calidad o fichas que no fueran de cartoncillo y as√É¬≠ el juego ser√É¬≠a perfecto.

11-04-2008 2 jugadores (Ra√É¬∫l "moro" juega con URSS  y Gato, que juego con EEUU).Era nuestra primera partida. Gato(yo) empiezo puntuando Europa y me meto 9 puntos en la buichaca; pero a partir de ah√É¬≠ mi rival empieza a recuperarme puntos: sube 2 pelda√É¬±os en carrera espacial , me gana mis olimpiadas... poco a poco me recupera terreno y acaba poniendose por delante. Me tocaban muchas cartas de los comunistas y no ve√É¬≠a opci√É¬≥n de quitarmelas sin beneficiarle much√É¬≠simo. Luego empiezo a recuperar territorio pero √É¬©l mandaba en el marcador. El juego lo aceb√É¬© yo con una carta de Guerra Tard√É¬≠a que baj√É¬≥ el Defcon a 2 y se hizo un scoring de todo el tablero. Me gan√É¬≥ por 17, una paliza; pero me vengar√É¬©.

See my review here: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/1088254

Thematic game - own the [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/422441]Deluxe edition[/url].  Video overview  [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/23763/item/479665#item479665]here[/url], comprehensive review [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/471953]here[/url]. Game length about 3 hours.  I do love asymmetrical games!  Russia has the advantage (can optional bidding to be Russia with US getting some starting influence)

Similar complexity to 1960, but more tension.  Comparison notes: 
* The theme has more appeal to me than 1960 (although I didn't mind 1960s theme, simply because the theme was so rich and it was so well done, and it's an opportunity to learn historical things I don't know).  
* I prefer the components of 1960 (although the deluxe edition of Twilight Struggle should help improve it somewhat).  
* I'm a bit hesitant about the game time (1960 is listed as 90 minutes on BGG, Twilight Struggle is listed as 180 minutes on BGG - hope that won't be an obstacle in my home!). As long as I can play it in an evening, but 3 hours is probably the longest that a game would get played here - if it's a good game that sustains interest of my opponents (example: Through the Ages)
* As for the difference in feel due to the forced play of opponent's events (in contrast to 1960), that can increase tension, and the only way I'll find out about that is to play.  This is the thing a lot of players don't like about TS - is that its not all about control, but in a lot of cases about "crisis management" - minimizing the damage to things that are out of your control.  

Note that knowing the deck allows you to play better -  you can make long-term plans and it becomes less of a reaction to the cards.  But don't study the deck before playing - there is huge fun in playing blindly, and discovering the cards as you go along, nothing like the first game as newbies, I'm told.

Game slightly favours Soviets (less so with optional cards included).  Ideas for balanced game for deluxe edition: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/527570
The 6 optional cards from Deluxe edition - suggest to include from outset, may help US slightly, see [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/545754/twilght-struggle-deluxe-optional-cards-review]this review[/url].

[url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/362972]Videos[/url] to help get into the theme - also see [url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpYCplyBknI]here[/url].

Ideas for new players: have them play as Russia and not worry about realignment; see also review on [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/630515/why-i-love-the-late-war-scenario-aka-luring-in-the]late war scenario[/url].  Late war scenario as described is for first edition, put space race markers on USSR box 5 & US box 8 (see [thread=759122]here[/thread] and [thread=476019]here[/thread]); note that USSR domination of Middle East is simply an error.

Most brilliant game I've ever played, one condition: you need an opponent, that will play with you regularly. No real point in showing the game to newcomers as it's most experience rewarding game I've played. So if you have e.g. wife/husband who likes the game, well, welcome to paradise.

This is one that my main group wants to play more of. It's the main war game that I have which isn't actually a war game. The card play is interesting and I don't think I've really wrapped my head around the clever use of cards yet. I really like the game and am down for more.

This game was extremely overwhelming on the first playthrough. The rulebook is a bit dense and there's a lot to remember. Once you get the hang of it though, this is a wonderfully deep strategy game with an awesome historical theme. Unfortunately, finding people to sit down to play this one can be challenging.

The game is very absorbing and fun. It is mostly of interest to people who lived through at least part of the Cold War. But...play balance is knife-edged and once it swings slightly one direction, the game rapidly becomes uninteresting for the losing player. It is also unbalanced to start and needs a minor adjustment to starting positions.

Cold war themed political war game based on a map of the world - covers time span from the end of WWII to Glasnost. Probably my favourite game. It is let down by the quality of the components. I have made my own map and used pieces from other games to rectify this.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The CDG par excellence, and a game every hobbyist should try at least once. It's a tense affair with interesting strategies and gambits. The card play is brilliant the way your opponents events activate when you play them and how scoring cards must be played. These stipulations make for agonizing decisions.

There is a barrier to entry as I well know. I hated the game at first, and it took several plays for my rating to climb to where it is. Finally, after a few plays I became familiar with the cards so that I had a sense of where I was in the deck and could make better choices. Until that point, I was just flailing and didn't see the allure of the game. Now that I'm somewhat skilled at the game, I've outgrown playing with local friends, but it plays great on Vassal.

I deduct a point from being a perfect 10 for the way bad rolls can derail a game. I had one where I got stuck in the Bear Trap for almost the whole damn turn. Not fun, and the rest of the game was pointless because I'd lost so many turns. As most of my plays are on Vassal, that's not a real problem; you restart quite easily, but had that happened on a day I scheduled off work with a buddy to play, that'd leave a sour taste.

Still, it's become one of my favorite games. I love learning which moves to prioritize while working around the "crappy" hand I've been dealt. I will say, as far as I'm concerned, this is a game of conflict simulation but not a wargame.  ;p)

This game has been my favourite 2 players' game about 3 years! My rating would have been '10' few mounts ago, but at last I got the feeling that maybe I've played this game too many times... It's time to get to know other games better. 

Updated 2012-02-03: Although there are weeks and months I don't play this game at all, I still love to play it regularly. It's THE game I'd take with me to an isolated island. One of the few games I can say I'm good at it. It's almost the most perfect game for me: rating increased to 10!

Updated 2012-11-19: Still playing this game every now and then. Rating decreased to 9 though.

Every winter when I was a kid, the neighbor boys would build a snow saucer run in their back yard, which had a steep hill.  It was curved and banked, and it was terrifying to look down from the top with your saucer in your mittened hands.  When you finally built up the courage to sit in the saucer and push off, you'd be flung down the hill, veering back and forth, spinning and getting dizzy and (if you didn't wipe out) making it to the bottom still trying to catch your breath from the ride.

That's just how Twilight Struggle feels.  Of course there are some games that end almost before they begin.  Sure there are wild twists of fate.  But if you don't make it, you can walk back up to the top and try another run.  And when you make it to the bottom, it's an accomplishment to be proud of.

I have been waiting for this game for a very long time.  

When, someday, as an even older duffer than I am now, I hear the young'uns in the hobby laugh at this game the way some of today's people laugh at, say, The Plot to Assassinate Hitler or Empires of the Middle Ages, I'll have to remind them that what made this game different was the mindset behind it, that before it was, effectively, nothing.

And of course they'll ignore me because by then political games will have their own subsection at Funagain, and there'll be more important arguments raging about whether an impeachment option for Bush is ever a valid game mechanism in a early "0h-0h's" game, or how to game for Third World Christian movements' dispersal and growth in North America and its resultant political effects, but hey, I'll have made my point.

I play this game only via e-mail with my best friend in Canada. We have complete trust in each other. Whenever we meet in person, I give out cards for our next turn. It usually takes us only 3-4 days to complete each turn. It is wonderful to see the map slowly change day by day & you really feel as if you are in the midst of a Cold War, fighting for each & every country all over the world. This is a brilliant game design & merits the #1 rating on BGG ---- although I personally prefer Duel of Ages 2 as my favourite game of all time.

First game took 6 hours(!), but I like it. I definitely see that to do well in this game you need to be familiar with the card decks but I'm hoping I can still have some fun even if that never happens (since I can't get the game played very often).

Realignment rolls were not used very much and I'm wondering if pros use them. Maybe now that I understand the game a little better they will make more sense but I'm not seeing it yet.

Lastly, I won't deny that it is a good game, I'm just not sure that it's a fun game.

If you need an introduction to card-driven war games it seems to me this is the place to start. 

Even though this is a war game it feels a lot like a euro, which was a comforting feeling in a new genre. I've been working on learning other CDGs and this one really helped me to see how the mechanics work. 

This game is exciting and interesting. 

Highly recommended.

This is really enjoyable game.
I like the to-ing and fro-ing of the influence in the countries and the victory points although the latter are quite few and far between. The space race is interesting and is a good way to pitch the event cards you do not want your opponent to benefit from.  The events each being either factional or neutral means occasionally you have no choice but to play that card, allow your opponent the event benefit and then undo the damage with the OPs that you got from playing the card. I like that you cannot hold on to the scoring cards from round to round and thus cannot set up the big scoring turns that would win you the game but must scrabble for every point inch by inch, card by card.

Highly thematic, exquisite, deep game-play, totally innovative systems, easy to learn but difficult to master... not much I can say that hasn't already been said about this instant classic.  One of the most original historical-themed games (notice I didn't say wargame... wink) ever to be devised.  Keeps both players engaged and on their toes at all times, every turn, with hardly any down-time... this game will certainly not bore you.  The physical presentation, even of my original first-edition version, is just fine, with an attractive and functional map and high-quality cards.  Easily one of the best 2P games I've ever played, or ever will play.

Twilight Struggle is a deep game with a lot of moving parts. The design and mechanics encapsulate the theme very well. Each play is gripping, tense, and stressful. In all my plays, neither side felt as if it was winning; instead both players seemed to be fighting each other to stay afloat. 

(I imagine two brutes fighting each other underwater: if they try to get air too soon, the other will win the fight. If they fight too long, they will both drown.)

It helps to learn the game with someone, because knowing the cards might give an experienced player an advantage.

Only played once, didn't finish it (in about 3.5 hours), but thoroughly enjoyed it. This is no pasted on theme, this is all about the Cold War. Importantly though, there is also a great game here. I can see lots of replayability with it. Bought a copy as soon as we finished. I'd imagine if you don't like the theme though, you maybe wouldn't like this game, because the game was built on the theme not vice-versa.

JAN 2018: Picked it up when it went on sale for $20 below online prices.

JAN 2015: I liked this game both because it is grounded in history that interests me and because it offers tense decisions in a 2p influence game. I also enjoyed "little brother" 1960: The Making of a President.

I have only played a half-game, but feel confident because of my experience with 1960.

An important game for Junior high & High school students to play (great way to pick up some history). Order of card play can be very involved, which if a player takes time to consider all the possibilities, can lengthen play time considerably.  Lots of things to remember to do.  Not a casual game.

If I were a teacher I would rate this game a 10.  However, I am an unlucky gamer.  Even though we have only one die apiece, it is heavily a dice game.  Throughout the entire game he rolled 5 &6's, while I rolled 1's.  I did well on the science track which takes a low roll but every intervention and 90% of the coups.  Also, as a gamer I don't like the down time of reading these great educational cards.  So considering it's downtime in card reading and resulting lengthy playing time and the heavy use of dice, I give it a low score.

Mindboggling tension fills every decision of every turn.  The Soviet comes roaring out of the gate to menace all of Europe in the early war.  If the US can hold its own, the opportunities abound to win it down the stretch.  Note to the wise, despite historical leanings, the world around Europe does not revolve.  For the USSR, Go South young man.  For the US, pray for early Voices and Rearguards.  Barring those, you will need to work hard to be where it counts.

Great thematic integration distances the game from pure influence shuffling; however it's long! The level of randomness is a bit higher than I'd like, especially on the die rolls. I do like how you get your opponents cards and have to time how to play them, as well as the historical assymetry.

Note:  I pre-ordered the latest version to get the mounted map and it looks fantastic.  It looks better in person than in photos, you will be happy if you pick it up!


Bottom line:  It's a CDG that's easy to get into.  The more you know the cards, the better it gets.

 Great game... Lots of dramatic events happening all over the map and you have to manage your hand of cards as well as possible to make the events unfold in a favorable way.  You're always trying to put a positive spin on really bad news.  I like it more the more I play it and love it's model of the cold war in Europe and the Third World.  Lot's of neat cards and cool ideas in this game. It's a slice of history that relates to my life.  My rating for this games wanders from and 8 to a 10 at times- who knows?  It's very good.  With more plays it's getting faster, I like it best in two hours.  A great intro to card driven wargames.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
In most respects, I should not like this game.  Until you learn the cards, there's wild swings in luck and I suspect there will still be once I really get them down.  This can be a bit frustrating.  

Still, I think it's precisely that each hand can be so huge that I love this game.  In the long run, stuff generally evens out, but sometimes all you need is for things to go your way a couple times in a row.  It can be so critical that you grab just one more country before you have to play a scoring card and maybe you gamble on some realignments or coups, success or not, you'll remember the card you played there.  

Maybe that's another reason I love it.  The events in this are familiar and interesting.  Playing a card like NATO or Fidel Castro actually has some meaning to me.  I don't have a clue about 90% of the events in a game like 1960 and all the cards just seem the same. 

I also love the bluffing aspect of this game.  It's a bit of back and forth when the opponent assumes you have a scoring card, so it's big if you can get them to fight you in a region where you're going to score points with another method.

Primero una declaraci√≥n de principios: No es un wargame :-D

Ahora bien, es uno de los juegos m√°s perfecto en sus mec√°nicas que he jugado. Parece mentira la ambientacion que consigue, y lo tensas que se ponen las partidas a medida que tanto tu, como tu adversario, vais jugando mejor y mejor.

Es claramente un "must have", y ahora que ha salido la version espa√±ola no tiene perd√≥n de Dios no tenerlo.

It is definitely a light war game. Next time we will have to go into reading the history behind each card to add to the experience. Since you aren't really trading casualties in the game it's not the same as a global domination game and no one player felt like they were winning at any point in the game. My biggest gripe is that a single drop of water touching the cards makes them taco on both sides and makes the cards completely useless for further play.I am now looking for a new copy of this game to replace my friends copy as I was the unfortunate soul that cause the spill which neither one of us was devastated by until we saw the cards react to the water, then it was tragic.

Everything they say about it is true!  A tense and exciting 2P game that my wife also loves.  However, the playing length somewhat limits its table-time, and we play without the 'Wargames' card...

(2nd ed.)
============================

Same great game, with a few additional cards, hard-mounted board, and a few new rules regarding the China card.
My only quibble with it is the incoherent design choices made in this third opportunity to refine the original map.  A coffee-pot stain on Canada; rippling 3-D flag photoshopped over the U.S.; mismatched graphical design of the various status tracks.  It's not that I'm a graphic designer, or that the map elements have been changed from their original implementation, but the lack of unity between the mismatched graphical elements strikes me as odd given that this is effectively the fourth edition of the game.
Still the same great gameplay, and graphical changes made to the country boxes and VP track are the distinct improvements one would expect.  Just a shame the new mounted map didn't get a once-over from a professional graphic designer before being rushed off to the printers...

It won't be everyone's cup of tea but if you have a dedicated opponent this is absolutely brilliant. 
It's super tense and every card you play feels like an agonising decision. At heart the rules are quite simple but what comes what of it is game of epic proportions. 
You need to be comfortable with a high luck factor in such a long game. I am and will play this any time.

Super etonant comme jeu (on doit jouer presque toutes ses cartes y compris celles qui aident l'adversaire). Pas si complexe d'un point de vue regle. Les cartes un brain wordy mais avec du fluff.

RATING: 9
Amazing game.  The theme fit the mechanics wonderfully.  We had to stop playing at turn 8.  I was the USSR and was ahead on the VP track, but probably would have lost given that (if I understand correctly) much of the balance in the game comes from the US's superiority in the Late War stage.

I would buy this in a heartbeat if I thought it'd ever make it to the table.  Unfortunately, the long playtime and 2-player limit make it basically impossible for me to play it locally.

RATING: 9
Incredible game but I‚Äôm not sure why it works so well. The game is completely card driven which can mean that the game can stack against you, dumping a bad hand on you whilst your opponent gets an easy ride. I‚Äôve nothing more than a passing interest in the Cold War period. You‚Äôre just playing cards to control territories. It can be chaotic as you‚Äôre not always sure what you‚Äôre planning against ‚Äì THAT card could come out and scupper you entirely. It‚Äôs almost an abstract despite all of this theme on the board and cards.

It shouldn‚Äôt work but it does. It really does.

It‚Äôs the dual use of the cards: for events or op points that make decisions agonising at times. It‚Äôs the timing of the events, particularly the timing of playing your opponents events which really gets you really thinking. It‚Äôs the brinksmanship; the dicing with the DEFCON level in order to exert further control over the board. It‚Äôs the back and forth, tug of war over key countries; the timing of scoring cards, just trying to nip domination of a region at the right time. It‚Äôs the flavour of these real world events that you‚Äôre playing ‚Äì and in my case, had heard about but quite often didn‚Äôt know that much about ‚Äì that really hooks you into the game and makes you want to go away and read up on what was actually going on.

It just works. And its glorious.

RATING: 9
A very immersive game, mid-way between euro and american. An important part of the mechanic could be summarized as: "you don't want to play cards that are good for your opponent but sometimes you need to do so". This really creates a unique crisis-management feeling that really matches the thematic setting. Luck plays an important role, but it can be controlled. The best american-style game out there? I'd say so.

Almost every decision in this game makes me stressed out. The game is all about hand management and minimizing the damage that you do when playing the opponets cards. I love the history on each card. I use cubes instead of the chits to mark influence, it looks pretty neat having TOWERS of influence facing off against each other. I play with the "1960" style cards.

This game feels like a game of chess between two superpowers vying for world domination.  

It will take several games to get good at this game as knowledge of the cards provides a serious advantage and opens up strategies, but even the first few games where you're just stumbling around are fun and surprising.  Definitely a better experience if you're learning how to play the game with someone rather than getting beaten to a pulp by a more experienced player.

Very easy to pick up, despite the size of the rulebook. Most of it is devoted to explanation of card effects which is kind of just added extra. Simple rules, but a lot of fun. There is a reason this is the top rated board game on the site. It's great. Vying for control of the various regions of the world during the cold war. It can take some time to play, but other times it can end in just 2 turns, but it is tense and exciting throughout.

RATING: 8
Twilight Struggle is a tense game. The different winning conditions mean that 'game over' constantly looms on the horizon, and you need to be alert at all times to thwart the plans of the scheming mind on the other side of the iron curtain.

In this struggle luck certainly plays its piece, both in the die rolls and the card draws. With players of different experience levels, however, knowledge of the card deck and how the various events interact is actually a much bigger factor. It is fairly obvious that Twilight Struggle requires repeated plays in order to fully appreciate the complexity and to avoid the most egregious blunders in card play. In this light, the wild swings of fortune might actually be a positive because they are also responsible for much of the interplay variability.

With that out of the way, the game delivers quite beautifully. There is a lot of bluffing and posturing going on in an attempt to outsmart the opposition, and always that nagging fear that everything you do will just play into your adversary's hands. Needless to say, the thematic integration works here.

I want to love this game, but it is mechanically too dry especially considering the theme, and too reliant on rolling/draw/etc. that are left unexplained.

The Cold War featured as a Card Driven game based on area control. Very tense, lots of thrill and even stress, every moment counts. Being acquainted with the cards is crucial. 

Thematic but not realistic. Games last  2-3 hours, if not less due to severe mistakes. 

Dice luck can be important sometimes since some dice rolls may result decisive.

A dynamic and engaging area influence game. The leader in an area can change quickly, so players have to be careful not to let one area slip irrecoverably out of control. This game has multiple counts of initiative you have to keep track of, one for each area. The event cards add an element of bluffing: they're strong enough to greatly impact an unprepared player but not too strong to seriously hurt a prepared one. 

I found the roll of dice in this game distressing, sometimes I felt like you could take the space race out. Not to worry though. Moderate players will realize that coups are risky and will use points on them accordingly. A good player will seldom lose the game because of bad dice. If you're about to roll a die you should be really comfortable with it having no result except letting you get rid of a card, and with this game its easy to get comfortable with that.

I bought this game based on the #1 rating but didn't think I would be interested otherwise. I've been playing with a (Non Wargamer) friend and have lost badly 4 times in a row but I can't keep away from it.

I own thousands of games (sad, I know) and this game very definitely deserves is ranking, I see playing this game for a very long time, it only gets better with each playing.

I've played this game quite a few times now and it's holding up extremely well. I generally prefer to play a broad spectrum of games (cult of the new) and not just focus on a few games but I keep coming back to this one as the go-to one night, two player game.

That's a very good implementation of the CDG system. It's tenseful and very engaging, makes you feel like you're there and then, I really love it.

It was the first CDG I got to play, and the first 'wargame', and it really made me (and my brother) want to explore the genre.

RATING: 5
Just think of this game as Hannibal: Rome vs. Cathrage with all the exciting parts taken out. You have Hannibal's political influence spaces and its card driven design. But you must play your opponent's events along with your ops points. Plus almost all combat is abstracted out. I also don't understand how the scoring points cards reflect reality. In the game, once a scoring card is played, and the scoring calculated, everyone immediately loses interest in a particular continent until the game ends. So, in game terms, the designer is saying that sometime around 1955 everyone lost interest in  Europe? And after sometime in 1968 everyone ignored Asia and only worried about Africa? Nor do I understand what dumping your opponent's events into the Space Race represents, especially in the early war years. Was there a space race in 1947?

Fun game, takes a commitment to get together to play just this, as it is so long.  Odd that this is the number 1 game on BGG--says more about the raters on BGG than it does about this game.

Have started playing this weekly, with a friend that is at the same level skill wise.  Fascinating game to experience.  Love the recreation of the Cold War, having lived through it.  Would be a great history lesson for the younger folks--teach them why containment was so important, in defeating Communism.

USA wins about 40% of our games.  Can usually get 2, sometimes 3 games done in an afternoon.

Twilight Struggle is a super-interesting game, where you must deploy your influence across the globe, while fending off the terrible events of history and utilizing the good ones.  The Cold War theme is amazingly integrated, using Event texts to change the rules of the game to reflect actual historical events.  To be good at it, you have to know the cards, and historically what is coming up.  Inevitably, I feel that enough bad roles and bad card draws can mean an ultimate loss.  There are ways to mitigate bad luck, but only if your knowledge of the game progression is solid.  I think TS is amazing for its thematic edge while the crushing mechanics (especially towards the Americans early on) makes this game often grueling.  However, TS captures the Cold War feel and the world domination mechanics are neat. It's fun to watch your Superpower spread its influence throughout the world. TS is not my favourite game, but for a wargame / card game it is one of the best.

This game feels like the cold war: long, arduous, two steps forward and one step back with frequent stretches of boredom.  Dislike getting a hand of cards, all of which do damage to me, and having to play them (every round).  This is probably the most thematic game I've every played.  Unfortunately, the Cold War is not, for me at least, a fun theme.

Amazingly elegant while still being card-based game with every card being completely different and having different power.

I like it.

The next day I'm still thinking about the game and that's what tells a lot about the game - that it fades deeply into your mind.

RATING: 6
I really, really want to like this game and give it an 8. I enjoy the idea behind the game, the expansion of influence, events that let you get around your opponent, and trying to neutralize the danger in your hand. But in 6-7 plays with my brother, the USSR has won a dominating victory every time. No matter how we switched off or how powerful we thought the US's hand was, it turned in to a rout.

We're certainly far from good at TS. But we are fairly experienced board gamers, and we each read several strategy articles about the game to try and get better at the US half of the game. No luck. I give it a 6 simply because of the frustration that we each showed when trying to prove that the US could win. 

Be aware that you'll need to house rule the game to get much out of it.

A card driven area control game. It is difficult to convince me that this is a wargame.  I contend it is NOT a wargame,  but if it leads people into exploring Hannibal, Wilderness Wars, Paths of Glory, WW2:Barbarossa to Berlin, Shifting Sands, ect. then I am a big supporter of TS.

Plenty of re-playability here. It is fun to learn the card interaction. I think the game will best shine with two experienced players.   Two newbs will feel it is luck of the card draw but as experience builds that will not usually be the case.

RATING: 7
The reason I don't rate Twilight Struggle higher is the same reason I don't play CDGs anymore: to really play the game well, you have to know the deck, otherwise you do things (or fail to do things) because you were caught unawares by a particular card that unravels a whole section of the map.  And to know the deck, it helps to play a few times.  And to play a few times, it helps to have a regular opponent, which I don't have.  This may sound like a personal problem, which should not impugn the game, but this characteristic of CDGs makes me less likely to suggest playing it.

Gameplay is pretty nifty, if you can find someone who knows the game about as well as you do. Otherwise, you're going to have to spend time tutoring the other player (or being tutored).

Version of politics/history presented here is, as Chris Farrell says, right-wing fantasy.

Curious to try its successors (1989, Labyrinth, 1960), which appear to be improvements upon TS.

RATING: 10
Admittedly, I am a big history buff and this includes the Cold War, which helps if you get into the theme, but once there, this CDG shines & sets the example for all other CDG's. Easily understood rules, nicely crafted components (Deluxe edition), and a steady tension combine to create a memorable experience. Like many games, it helps if players are somewhat at equal levels, otherwise one player will better usilise the cards coming out. But not many games reach this level, though there are many imitators.

Review after 20 plays.

Gain influence. Your opponent undoes what you did. Repeat until you are forced to play a card that makes your opponent gain an edge. But don't worry, he will soon be forced to play a similar card to your advantage.

Can't believe that most interesting parts of the game are solved by a 50% odds on a die roll: 50% miss your turn/50% slight change happen. The very next round, the opponent undoes what you did.

You can coup and downgrade DEFCON by 4 times provoking your opponent, when it is his turn to do so he loses. Seems enough to quit this game.

(I could stand up to round 3 against the AI then I lost after it scored an insane amount of points in East Asia. It had 3 countries there, versus my 7. It won. Don't ask me why, I don't care any more)


Those who rated 2+: YOU ALL ARE WRONG.

I really wanted to like this game.  It has a great theme, and the game mechanics fit the theme really well.  But the fact is, I find it to be both long and frustrating.  The dice rolls and the sets of cards that come up play a large role in determining the outcome.  I typically don't look forward to taking my turn, as it always *feels* like I'm trying to manage a bunch of bad events rather than a bunch of good events... perhaps that makes me a pessimist, but it is my perception nonetheless.

The rules are excellent. The map is graphically pretty good, but given the price I paid I'm really not happy that it takes the form of an unmounted cardboard fold-out.

I don't understand why the feedback on this game is so overwhelmingly positive.

[Rating moved down from an initial 9;]

Pros: Addictive and fast; Gives great historical flavor while working wonderfully as a game.  

Cons: Upon repeated playings, some of the late war cards seem too powerful, leaving a long well fought game decided by luck too much for my tastes. Play balance issues are still not decided. While some CDG vets claim "it's perfectly balanced", the Ames card, as well as the US need to REALLY know all the cards to avoid a competent Soviet steamroller early on, will leave many finding play balance issues, at least initially.

We're only 2 games in, and haven't yet made it to Late War, but I can already tell this is a winner. I love that it's a 2 player game, with obvious staying power, that interests my husband, that's got an authentic theme, and that we'll just probably enjoy more and more as we get more familiar wit the cards and anticipating the game play. I can see this being a pretty regular staple for us. The only drawback is that the game set up is Fragile - meaning, it will not withstand young kids hanging about and grabbing at things and messing with the tiles , so this is a save for after bedtime game, which will limit play somewhat. It will be a great alternative to just watching Netflix, however.

Update: We don't pull it out often enough to become familiar with the cards and get the full flavor of the strategy, so this is still a little dry to me. I would like to get it out more.

RATING: 9
This is an excellent game.  My rating stands; it is largely a cardgame in many respects.  It deserves its popularity.  Eurogamers now see the genius and color that the CDG format allows, which is great.  But it still fails to get into the top of my ratings because of the overly emphasized card game aspect but also because I feel that the card management itself is refined but still missing some tension.  Except for early war, you will not see many of the cards more than, maybe twice, which takes some of the "Do I play this now or space race it?" out of the game.  Space racing is very, very frequently the best option because you will never see that event again.  Nevertheless, I've played this game with a friend and if you want to get them into CDGs, this is it.

Really what sets this game apart is that it is so thematic.  It captures its subject, brinkmanship and paranoia, with very few rules.  It is baked into the game.  Deftly done.

Later:

Moved it up quite a bit.  Now that I've really nailed down the cards the games are going the distance and I am enjoying them more.  My comments still stand but I put the rating up to recognize my increased enjoyment.  A game getting better over time is a quality I really value.  This is my go-to 2 player game of choice, many years after I bought it.  I have the collector's edition.

People are goo-goo about this game, and I love the idea and theme of this one.  When I did get a chance to play this, well, it fell flatter than a GMT thin cardboard playing surface.  I had no idea how dull and lackluster the Cold War was, or how arbitrary the Space Race was.  There are pictures and theme to the cards, but in the end, you are looking for card combos.  Since you pretty much empty your hand each turn, it's more like the cards play you.  There are some interesting aspects to the game, and I really want to play the game again.

Update: Serious kudos to GMT for the Deluxe Edition. They really did a bang up job with it. I can't wait to give this another go now.

RATING: 9
One of the best. This game suffers from prolonged set up and pack down, but this distracts little from a stunning game. Each mechanic makes sense and only adds to the theme of a cold war. Twilight Struggle has a deep strategy with a good splash of luck that makes for wonderful game play that will maintain replay ability for a long time to come.

RATING: 8
Quite a tense game. I think it is a bit over-hyped though. The actual game play is just dropping counters and playing cards. Each players turn can be screwed up by the next move...and if you have some bad card draws...you often are forced to mess yourself up.

It's good and informative, captures the political aspect of the era well...but anyone who rates this a 10 just wants to believe it's better than it is. ;P

This could be a 10 with more plays and a better understanding of the game.

Repetitive area-majority battles and victory point marker that moves back and forth over zero make this as drawn out and swingy as the real cold war. By Late War, my partner and I were tired of the take-a-penny-leave-a-penny on the beautiful board and considered causing global thermonuclear war as a quick way to produce a winner. The historical tie-ins of the action cards kept our interest for much of the game, but I don't see myself revisiting in order to memorize the cards, which I'm sure allows a much more rewarding strategic arc.

A very good two player euroish war game.  Players alternate playing cards that allow them to do ops (e.g. coup attempt, add political influence) exercise an event (e.g. NATO formation) or call for a scoring of a region (e.g. Middle East).  The game has ten turns that are divided amongst the early, mid and late cold war.  Each later period of the war adds in new event cards.  The U.S. has to struggle early but it's a fun struggle and they can catch-up to and surpass Russia in later turns.

Perfect combination of rich, powerful theme with a wonderful, tight and deep gameplay.

You alternate turns playing cards to spend points or activate events. But amongst the cards in your hand, there are opponent's events, which are detrimental to you when you play them (and you'll have to).

Meaningful choices every turn, strategic and tactical thinking, non-predictable situations with preventable results.

The most popular card-driven game, a true best-seller. It has many virtues: simple, faster than others, intense... It has clever mechanics and a huge interaction between cards. The subject -Cold War- is also interesting and well-known.

It is not in my top simply because I prefer "conventional" wars for playing. I also see a problem for novice players: in all card-driven games having experience -and knowing the cards- gives advantage. Here that factor is just decisive!

Played this maybe a dozen times and I think the US player has only won once or twice, which knocks it down a notch for me. Excellent game, but ultimately exhausting.

Update: now that the digital version has come out I've played against the AI fairly intensely for a couple of weeks, and I've grown a deeper appreciation for this game. It manages to evoke 50 years' worth of brinksmanship and paranoia in such an involving way, and you can't help but want to find out more about the stories behind all the events. A masterpiece of design. Bumped back up to an 8.

I need to play this game more but after my first real play of this, I knew it was all that it was cracked up to be.

It's actually much simpler than I would have thought it to be in terms of rules.  Sometimes I feel like GMT shoots themselves in the foot with their rulebooks.  If you are thinking of getting this game or playing it for the first time, I would highly recommend going to twilightstrategy.com and reading Theory's primer on the game to learn how to play.  MUCH simpler than the rulebook without leaving out many things, and I think it's enough to jump in and just start playing.

I look forward to playing this more with my friend who I learned it with.  Neither of us have played the game well, but still enjoyed it very much.

The hard thing, of course, is that it's two players.  So I generally don't play a 2p game at our game nights, particularly one that is this long, so the only times I've gotten to play it are when we schedule a specific time to play.

This is again a game which is really hard on the first try. It's a bit like CCG's, it requires you to know the cards in the game to play well and to really enjoy it. Our first game too a long time, we actually ended it just before the late war, just when situation started look bright to me (US). I definitely liked it, but of how much, I'm not sure yet. I just fear I don't get to play it that often, it just takes forever with new players who are not fast.

Strong theme works well with the mechanics.  I may eventually raise this score with more plays, but the mechanic of having the opponent's event happen if you use the card for ops points really decreases your available options.  They did a very nice job of simulating the give and take with the military actions so that if one side goes for some the other is really obligated to do so as well. I understand that the lack of options is thematic, but it does detract a little bit from the game, IMO.

I really believe that it is the ultimate 1 on 1 boardgame.
It captures magnifically the whole subject of the cold war and "supports" it greatly through the gameplay.

RATING: 10
Excellent two player strategy game.  The depth of enjoyment of this game only gets deeper the more you play it.  Game can seem a bit overwhelming at first to new players (particularly to those players with euro boardgame experience and little wargame experience), but is very rewarding once you get a couple of plays under your belt.  The true enjoyment of this game really comes from playing enough times that you begin to learn the cards and understand how best to minimize the negative impact of your opponent's event cards.  The Warsaw Pact Formed card, as an example, can have a significant negative impact for the U.S. player if played at the beginning of the game, but that same card can have a disastrous effect if played towards the end of the game.  Learning how and when to best play the various cards and responding to your opponent are the really enjoyable parts of this game.  The depth of this game is amazing and worth the investment in time to play through several games to see if the game suits you.

Hard to come up with words that haven't already been said about why this game is so great. I still feel a bit reluctant to play it because it seems daunting but it helps that I learned it at the same time as Chris. Strange that I should feel this way because, other than a few minor points regarding realignments and coups, the rules are not that complex. 

I don't know if it's fair or not but I tend to compare TS to Cuba Libre (and by extension the other COIN games I have yet to play) and I feel that TS is the superior game. There is still a fair bit of luck with dice rolling and some devastating cards that can, if they end up in your hand, completely wipe out an opponent's influence/control of a country. However, you know that your opponent is on an equally luck-based footing so it doesn't seem too awful. And if you end up with a card whose event is bad for you, at least you can dictate when it pops, space it, or simply hold it for the game.

I need to own this one!

Truthfully, this game looked scary at first. After playing one round through though everything made sense and was very easy to continue playing. Loved all the thematic history. I almost took europe! Poland betrayed mother Russia! Barely took it with SE asia. Will play again!
On a side not, unintentionally, I know alot more about the cold war now. I never realized exactly how much this war influenced and exactly how close we actually came to nuclear war.

Another thing, do not ignore Europe newbies! Understand it's importance and the importance of score cards. if you do not attempt to keep even footin in Europe you've effectively lost.

There is a learning curve! Once you get throuhgh one round, itll make more sense to the other player. Everything is beautiful and great about this game, but it got lowered in rank to 9 because im hesitant to bring it out with new people because there is alot of tactics, plus if you played before you have the advantage of knowing the cards

The USSR has an advantage, so it's probably best to bid either influence or VPs for sides.

Coups may be too powerful in Africa/SE Asia (from a game design standpoint - they're probably about right from a historic perspective).

The back-printed counters in the second edition are a major improvement.

Some of the randomness tends to be self-canceling, but the game definitely has potential for a small number of lucky events to determine the outcome.

Some cards' interactions could benefit from better cross-references or clarifications.

It takes a special night when I am in the right mindset for this one.

Excellent implementation of GMT's card driven system. The game feels tense and makes you second guess your every move constantly. It perfectly fits the cold era theme, and gives a deep and clever understanding of the historical events happening at the time. I do not agree with the card stock used for this game, the gloss cards seem to get damaged easily and are harder to shuffle then standard cards. The board is thick, yet it has a hard time staying flat on the table. Overall the game lets new comers make interesting decision in the first few games, and rewards continuous plays with support to a range of strategies. A great tactical game, would recommend it to anyone with a friend who is willing to sit down for an evening and explore the history of the Cold War.

Elegant historical game with strong theme. It can take several hours to play the game, maybe some cards are not so well understood as they could be, however those are minor drawbacks compared to pros. The game is like a story, which ends with one side victory after a long struggle. The theme is everywhere, the mechanics are simple, yet good. You always see back how did you in game. Card driven mechanic makes sense in this game and it this game is very tactical with some overall strategy available as well. Every move is intriguing and results can be surprising. Everything makes sense in this game just like in real life (politics).

Fantastic game, I absolutely love the mechanic of crisis management. I've never played a game quite like this one, the rules seem tough initially (it took me and my cousin a few turns to get it), but they are actually very simple.

Fun and crazy game. This is not a good simulation. Detente will never occur and the game is almost ahistorical in assuming the Soviets were seeking to aggressively spread Communism outside their sphere of influence. Still, it is a great game, and the history is just good enough.

I NEVER use defcon suicide rules and it is a good idea to remove Red scare/purge from the game.

Since We the People and Hannibal, the cdg-style wargames have gotten increasingly complicated.  I don't like that direction, because I think the brilliant idea of these early games is that you have a very simple game system, and the chrome and complexity and flavor is added by the cards.  Twilight Struggle is the first cdg since Hannibal that has grabbed hold of this simple truth.

I've always preferred the single-deck approach to cdg games (Hannibal, Napoleonic Wars, Wilderness War, We the People, For the People) to the two-deck approach of games like Paths of Glory.  Having a deck for each player might produce a better simulation, but a shared deck for both players creates much more tension.  Twilight Struggle uses a single deck, but with one brilliant innovation.  An opponent's event will happen whenever you use its card for any purpose (with a couple of sneaky exceptions).  This puts you into a constant state of crisis management!  It also means there will be a [i]lot[/i] of events happening.  Gameplay revolves around the card events much more than in any other cdg I've played.

The focus on the events makes for a wild and woolly game full of turnabouts and high drama.  I think that's the perfect atmosphere for a game about the Cold War.  You're walking the razor's edge, with the constant threat of thermonuclear war hanging over your head.  What a game!

Absolutely an awesome game! First impressions were great, my gaming partner is my girlfriend (now wife) and she read the rules alone so we were having competitive games right away. The cards, choices were excellent. The first game was so fun because we agreed to not read any of the cards and just see what happens - this resulted in her putting 5 influence in Japan and then me playing the Japan agreement card :)

After 5 plays during her 3 week visit (long distance relationship :() She liked it so much I have now promised not to play it with others so we stay at same level of experience! Cant wait till December to get some more plays with her - and of course see her.

Is it a war game or not? Does it really matter? It is a very thematic and extremely tense game which gets better the more you play it. It is definitely not a simulation of the events, instead it recreates James Bond-style the tension, the uncertainty and the rational distrust of the two superpowers.

I have been hearng this a lot. Being best game on BGG for quite a while.  I acquired it over kickstarter with digital version and some additions. (pre-war stuff)

Our initial run with my wife was painful, because we had difficulties understanding the rules. It took about 4 hours to understand the game completely.

After we understand the game, we played a lot! I mean at least 40+ games. It is a very balanced game, and I remember I had to take some time between rounds just to ease down the stress  going in my neck. It really builds up tension as it supposed to be.

Great game, I would recommend it to all, who is looking for a 2 player competetive game!

Pretty darn good. With card-driven games escalating into ever more complicated forms, it's good to get back to basics and remember what a flavorful, breezy, and competitive experience a simpler CDG can deliver. Once you get your head wrapped around the differences in playing ops points for control versus realignments or coups, and once you understand how the events fire off, this one ticks right along. It's tense, has that wonderful quality of wanting to do everything, but having to choose to do only a few things, and it generates a good narrative.

Most two player games are either simple or pure abstract. I am glad that this one is neither. It has flavor and depth. It's hard to say if both sides are really equal balanced. I feel that in the early war USSR has slightly better cards and has therefore an advantage for an early win but then in the midwar, cards seem to be more favorably for the USA so that they can turn the game to their advantage if they survive long enough. As a player you can influence a lot but still there will be a significant luck factor as cards are drawn and dice are rolled. In my last game USA wasn't even able to send a dog into space and I tried to do so  every round until I lost the game... I love the 2player game ATON, if you know both then you understand why Twilight Struggle itches somehow (because it's heavier) the same sweet spot. So it's mainly for the balancing and the luck factor this game is rated 8 and not 9 by me. Maybe future plays will change the rating.

Wonderful game. So thematic (and a theme that I absolutely love). A game of this will make you feel like you've boxed for 12 rounds...it's very tension-filled and mentally draining. Length is the only downside to this - a full 10 turns can go 150 minutes, which is pretty long for a 2-player game for me. I've come to determine I love the CDG-style of game (the length of 1960 is making this the preferred game for me now).

Ok, very beautiful game, elegant and tense. Easy to learn and to teach, easy to play. But it just doesn't give me the tension other games - such as PoG - have given me. 

UPDATE
I did play this game some more, but still I gain NO enjoyment out of it. I rate it now a 7 out of an initial 8.

Only played a couple of times and will probably climb in rating as I play more because I'm a big fan of the CDG format and this one has undoubted quality. It scores a lower rating at the moment because the genre isn't one that necessarily appeals to me, I can see it's one of those games where disparity in experience negatively impacts enjoyment for both parties (therefore limiting options for finding opponents) and it lacks the the feeling of personal identification and therefore narrative I get with something like the generals in Hannibal...fully understanding that impartial detachment fits perfectly with its theme but I'll probably never fully warm to the cold war, no matter how good the game play.

Not only is the strategic space of this game wide open, the counterfactual historical narrative that arises makes it both educational and entertaining. Its #1 ranking on BGG has been well deserved for a long time, and I hope it holds on.

Wow! This just gets better and better. I love the panoramic scope of this game. Is there a game where a complex period of history is so successfully realised, without being fiddly and overly burdened with shiny chrome exceptions?  There is luck but to be lucky you need to take risks.  In short, this is not for the faint hearted; you and an equally skilled opponent will be engaged in what is, in essence, a 10 round bout of psychological arm wrestling.

Tense, brilliant, thematic, and engaging game full of weighty decisions and plenty of surprises. The game has earned its accolades and ranking here on BGG. A relatively small set of possible actions each turn somehow turns into a desparate struggle where every turn has more drama and excitement than most other board games have from start to finish. What surprised me was how effective the thematic elements are: the card text and graphics cause memories from my childhood to well up, adding an unexpected emotional element to the gameplay experience. The game is actually very easy to learn but it's tough to make a decision, so the game that should take 2 hours will probably take 3. It's highly recommended, however, for boardgamers and historical simulation fans.

I really like this game a lot. However, in my latest full playing the game went on waaay too long. I'm sure it was because we were both new players, but our time was still far longer than what we expected. The beginning was exciting, but towards the mid and late war we were both just going through the motions. I look forward to playing this again, and hopefully the next game will go more quickly.

RATING: 8.99999
In response to the many challenges to this game's Play Balance and questions about its brilliant and highly innovative but idiosyncratically complex and resultant problematic card interactions many Standard Game advocates have long employed the dubious and comically transparent defense of "There's nothing wrong with the play balance and it will be fixed in next updated-rules-clarification/extensive-errata/additional-At-Start-IPs/Card-Ops-value-adjustment/unbalancing-card-text-and-function-rewrites/optional-but-never-playtested-China-Card-variation/optional-additional-cards (after correcting the cards' glaringly obvious omissions and errors)-originally-offered-for-a-fee-as an-"upgrade"-but-now-included-in-the-latest-version and anyone who says different is a heretical poopyhead!" 
 
Most ad-hoc fixes (of the Second Edition) are of the Static one time pre-start type such as, "Award 2-3 additional At Start IPs to the US" however a die roll of 5 or 6 on a USSR First Action Round Coup of Italy or Iran wipes that out in an instant and that type of fix doesn't adequately address the advantage the USSR enjoys due to some game mechanics along with some other consistency, logic and balance skewing issues. The following suggestions are intended to take a more Dynamic approach which in most cases continually affect the process and are listed in my own personal perceived order of severity. Some of these suggestions are my own and others are cribbed and amended from other TS enthusiasts. As always, the standard caveat, YMMV: 
 
 
1) Issue: Getting a load of Scoring cards at any time but especially in the first three or four turns when every Ops point is crucial can kill your momentum. This effect is compounded by the Third Turn reshuffle; it is entirely possible for one player to be saddled with six scoring cards in the first three hands or for one power to attain early Domination in one area and have it score twice in rapid succession. The problem is of such magnitude that the TS GM at WBC for 2009 implemented a fix that had been considered during playtest which is to remove any played Scoring cards from the Third Turn reshuffle and place them in the Mid War cards added on the Fourth Turn. There is a discussion of this on Consimworld in the TS folder starting on 26 May 2009. The Designers have utterly rejected the validity of this variation stating that the potential for Early War Scoring Card repetition is intentional and playing with any fix for this issue is not playing Twilight Struggle. That unambiguous proclamation would certainly de-legitimize my following proposed fix which is admittedly a little complicated, but if you've played enough TS to see a game fall apart due to the Early War "Three Scoring Cards combined with a couple of 1-2 Ops Cards hand" (or with the 2 Ops cards' value cut in half when combined with your opponent's play of Red Scare/Purge) situation you'll understand the need for some kind of fix. If you don't like my suggestion then find something that works for you. Advice from Standard Game proponents that when this occurs that you can "Just start another game" is jejune at best, sycophantic at worst and despite mocking assertions of statistical unlikelihood it amounts to a tacit admission of the menace this broken mechanic portends; your investment of time, money and effort justifies a more pragmatically constructive response.
 
Fix: A. Distribute the Scoring Cards in a manner similar to the method employed in Alhambra. Shuffle and divide the Early War Cards (less the three Scoring Cards) into six stacks of descending totals: 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 2. Shuffle one scoring card each in the 7 and 5 stacks and place the third Scoring card under the 2 stack then combine the stacks to make the Draw pile placing the larger stacks on top of each smaller stack. Do the same with the Mid War cards (minus the 4 Mid War Scoring Cards): 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3. Shuffle one of the four Mid War Scoring cards into stacks 8, 6 and 4 and place the fourth card at the bottom of the entire stack. For most situations this will release one Scoring card in each of the first four turns.
 
B. Eliminate the Third Turn reshuffle of Early War cards. When the Early War deck is exhausted simply start drawing from the Mid War deck. The re-playable Early War cards will reappear in the reshuffle of Mid and Early War cards which will probably occur on Turn 6 instead of Turn 7.
 
C. Allow a _voluntary_ option for a player holding two or more Scoring Cards at the start of the turn, before Headline Cards are played, to declare the total number of Scoring cards held (not which ones they are) in his/her hand and to then randomly discard Scoring Cards, which are then turned face up as each one is discarded, down to only one Scoring Card which remains concealed and which must be retained. Then replenish the hand by drawing face-down cards to refill the hand (any additional Scoring Card drawn while replenishing must be immediately revealed as such and discarded face up). The discarded Scoring cards do not go into the Played Discard pile but are shuffled into the Draw pile _after_ the replacement cards are drawn. The player using this option is not allowed to hold back a desired Scoring Card by not declaring it while discarding undesired cards (such as originally holding three but declaring only two) above the single Scoring Card required to be retained and if at the end of the turn is found to have had more than the one Scoring Card suffers an automatic loss. 
If the player holding multiple Scoring Cards likes his/her chances to capitalize on those cards he/she is not required to declare them and discard down to one Scoring Card but may instead make the best use of the hand as is.
 
 
2) Issue: Defcon typically hovers at 2-3 caused by first Action Round coups by the USSR and driven by competition for Mil Ops and a desire to prevent one's opponent from couping a vital 1 or 2 Stability BG of yours which facilitates some gamey uses of card combinations which end the game by Defcon loss; In reality most of the Cold War was not spent on the brink of annihilation and when it was at that precipice World Opinion frowned on a Super Power continuing to instigate regional wars and recklessly couping even backwater countries, not just (game defined) "Battleground" countries.

Fix: Each Mil Op in either player's total which is _greater_ than the End of Turn Defcon level causes a VP loss the same way each Mil Op less than the End of Turn Defcon level does. It is possible for both players to exceed Mil Ops and is resolved the way standard rules deal with both players having too few Mil Ops _or_ one player may end the turn with too many Mil Ops while the other may have too few, each is then compared, one for the excess and the other for the deficiency and the greater differential is applied as lost VPs to that player. The only way to avoid losing VPs in relation to Defcon is to exactly equal it in Mil Ops at the end of the turn. For purposes of this rule only do not stop the count of Mil Ops at 5.

Example: A turn ends at Defcon 3; The USSR has 7 Mil Ops and the US has 2 Mil Ops. Per normal rules the US would lose 1 VP for failing to meet Defcon by 1 Mil Op and the USSR would be unaffected because its Mil Ops met or exceeded the end of turn Defcon Level but under this rule the USSR would lose 4 Mil Ops for exceeding the end of turn Defcon status by 4 while the US loses the 1 VP for having less 1 Mil Op thus causing a Net Loss of 3 VPs for USSR.
 
2.5) Issue: The first Action Round is usually spent on a USSR coup to gain Mil Ops and protect Battle Ground countries.
 
Fix: Coup/Counter-coup: Allow the victim of the Coup (in any Action Round) of a BG in an area which normally would have been made ineligible due to Defcon being lowered to be allowed to stage an immediate Counter-coup of the same BG on his/her next Action Round following the first coup. For example: If USSR makes a first Action Round coup of Italy (lowering Defcon to 4) the USA has the option on his Action Round immediately following (unless blocked by Quagmire) to also Coup Italy (not any other European country). Defcon would be lowered to 3 and a Counter-counter-coup by USSR is not permitted. Normal rules providing for loss by lowering Defcon to 1 still apply.

 
3) Issue: Realignments are rarely available for Europe, Asia and Middle East.

Fix: Allow Realignments in any area regardless of Defcon level with a cumulative favourable DRM applied to the non-phasing player of +1 DRM for each Defcon level below what the Standard rules would allow. For example: Realigning a country in Europe when Defcon is at 2 (which is three levels below that which would normally permit Realignments in Europe) would give the non-phasing player +3 DRM in addition to any potential DRMs for controlling adjacent countries or more IPs in the target country. The same situation for a Realignment in Mideast would supply a +1 DRM to the non-phasing player. Thus, you can attempt Realignment anywhere, anytime but you'll want to be sure you have plenty of friends in the neighborhood.


4) Issue: USSR starting with the China card makes it too powerful and is unhistorical since in 1945 when the game purports to begin the Chinese Nationalists and Chinese Communists had not settled who was in control of China. The standard game does not deal with this uncertainty other than to assign the China card to the USSR at start which assumes the historical outcome with no allowance for a difference in the game's change of the flow of history from the At Start point. The designers tacitly acknowledged this game unbalancing mechanism by conjuring up the China Civil War variant with USSR being required to spend 3 Ops points to acquire control of the China card as a fix and game balance option, but this again assumes an outcome favorable only to the USSR. I offer a similar option but with what I consider to be a more coercive trigger.
 
Fix: Neither player starts with the China card but the first Coup/Realignment attempt of any country in Asia delivers the China card face down to that player's opponent available to play next turn with normal rules for use and acquiring the China card thereafter. For Events that reference which player holds China assume US possession if the card has not been put in play due to above requirement.

4.5) Issue: Korean War USSR victory too easy to achieve and again has no outcome beneficial to the US. Employing one fix or another of the USSR Starts with China Card issue may mitigate this but the two are linked.
 
Fix: A. There are two preconditions for this card to played as the Event and thus to trigger the war actually occurring: 1: USSR must control North Korea and 2: The USSR must have possession of the China card. Korean War cannot be played as the Event unless _both_ of these preconditions are met and if either or both conditions are not in effect the card can only be played for Ops and is then placed in the Discard pile. In a standard game both these conditions are in effect At Start but any change of initial control of the China card such as the Designers' or my variation of the Optional China Card Rule necessarily affects this.
 
B. US receives a +1 DRM for control of South Korea (the more the US directly invests the harder it is inclined to fight) the same as the DRMs for control of adjacent countries. This way the US is more likely to seize control of South Korea as soon as possible to tilt the odds in US favour rather than hold off committing IPs that can only bolster USSR control if the USSR wins the Korean War.

Note: The prerequisite of USSR control of North Korea for the war to occur eliminates the unseemly occurrence of US control of North Korea (thus gaining a +1 DRM) when the North invades the South. Been there, done that, got the Campaign Ribbon.


5) Issue: Red Scare/Purge can be a game ender if the same player (especially USSR) gets it twice in the first three turns (and you're not using the No Third Turn Reshuffle fix listed above). This issue was tacitly acknowledged by the Designers by their decision to raise the card's Ops value from 2 to 4 in the Second Edition but this actually exacerbates the problem. A 4 Ops "Scare" increases its likelihood of occurring in a Headline Phase before any possible cancelation by (admittedly unusual) combinations of other Events such as US playing Five Year Plan which could cause USSR to discard Defectors which would immediately occur and thus cancel USSR's Headline play of Red Scare; if Red Scare is a 4 Ops Event it will occur before Five Year Plan or any other 3 Ops US Headline Event can affect it.
 
Fix: Keep it a 2 Ops card as it was in the First Edition and make it an alternating Event. Whoever plays it first as the Event cannot play it as the _Event_ a second time unless and until the other player gets it and chooses to play it as the Event. If playing the Second Edition 4 Ops value it becomes playable again by the first player as an Event when the other player plays it either as the Event _or_ for any Ops purpose other than as a Space Race discard. Use a chit to flip indicating previous use as the Event.
 
 
6) Issue: Losing to "Wargames" on a measly (and fixed) 7 Point spread is a bummer.
 
Fix: A. Make the VPs to be forfeit a weighted variable. After the Event is declared (Defcon still must be at 2) make a 2d6 die roll to determine the number of VPs required to be forfeit thus making it an additional gamble if you're not at least 13 VPs ahead but allowing for a desperation attempt if you're only 3 VPs ahead (or you go even bigger and make it a 3d6 roll).
 
B. Allow cards to be played for Ops to be used to raise Defcon a maximum of 1 Level Per player Action Phase. Ops spent per Action Phase for this use must be at least equal to current Defcon level to raise it to next the level. For instance, if Defcon is currently at 2 then spending 2+ Ops will raise it to Defcon 3. If Defcon is at 4 it costs 4 Ops to raise it to 5. Ops spent for this purpose are per Action Phase and any Ops in excess of those needed to raise the Defcon level do not accumulate from one Action Phase to any later Phase. 
 
This allows a player who fears his/her opponent's imminent play of Wargames to forestall it by raising Defcon to 3 but with the obvious detriment of the loss of impulse. It can also be useful in other rarer situations, with the added peril of affording one's opponent additional Coup/Realignment options if the opponent has any cardplays remaining.

 
7) Issue: Bear Trap/Quagmire bad die rolls are a real drag. (The Designers have declared that the possibility of a lengthy series of 5/6 rolls effectively ending the game is an intentional occurrence and not a design flaw)
 
Fix: A. Allow (after any current aggregate Ops modifications) a -1 DRM to any roll made using a 3 Ops card and a -2 DRM to a 4+ Ops card (assuring extrication). Thus, if you choose to employ minimum resources to solve the problem you may still get stuck for a potentially interminable number of rounds but if, as in the real world, you divert more resources and national attention to the problem you stand a better chance of getting out.
 
B. Add +1 to the Ops value of the discard if the card's Event is exclusive to the phasing player. Thus, a 1 Ops card the Event for which is exclusive to the phasing player can be used to satisfy the minimum requirement for play (after including any aggregate effects such as Red Scare/Purge, Containment or Brezhnev Doctrine).
 
 
8) Issue: Space Race bad die rolls are a real drag. (And incidentally it throws the historic Timeline off since players rarely get to "Eagle/Bear has landed" by the end of the game when it actually occurred in the Mid War time-frame)

Fix: A. Give a cumulative -1 DRM for each failed previous attempt per space on the Space Race Track, starting a fresh count on the next space once successful on the previous space. The -1 DRMs can reach a guaranteed success level.
 
B. Add +1 to the Ops value of the discard if the card's Event is exclusive to the phasing player (after including any aggregate effects such as Red Scare/Purge, Containment or Brezhnev Doctrine).

 
9) Issue: The First and Second Edition Aldritch Ames Event is way overpowered and also potentially delays the game by USSR feet dragging to arrange the revealed US cards. After initially ignoring concerns about this Event in the changes implemented in the Second Edition the Designers finally acknowledged its game wrecking mechanism and attempted to address it in the Third Edition by changing the effects to have the USSR discard one card from the revealed US hand, but this still allows the USSR to dither about card choice. 
 
Fix: Require the US player rather than the USSR player to order the US's revealed hand (including allowing use  by US player of "UN Intervention" as the Event to cancel a USSR Event by indicating its position after the card to which it _may_ be applied, such play to be determined at the time the preceding USSR Event card comes due to be played). After all, Ames may have leaked vital information but he was not a Puppet Master.
 
 
10) Issue: OPEC, the gift that keeps on giving! The potential for OPEC's re-occurrence as a one-way USSR scoring card makes USSR auto victories too easy. A USSR player with OPEC and SALT is a lock.
 
Fix: OPEC is a single occurrence Event and is removed after the Event occurs.
 
 
11) Issue: Decolonization too powerful if it reappears in USSR hand in first three turns.
 
Fix: Essentially fixed by omitting the Third Turn re-shuffle (see above) except it may appear early in the Mid War deck. If it remains bothersome make it (and Colonial Rearguards) one time Events.
 
 
12) Issue: Flower Power ruling by the Designers that even if a listed dual use War Event card is played by the US for Ops (except for Space Race) it still inflicts the 2 VP loss.
 
Fix: Don't do it. The 2 VP loss would still be in effect for any USSR only war Event since the Event is required to occur (except Arab-Israeli War after Camp David) when played for Ops by the US but any dual use War Event card played for Ops should not incur the VP loss.
 
 
13) Issue: USSR first card advantage is devastating to play balance. This will be substantially mitigated if employing the the revised end of turn Mil Ops to Defcon variation.
 
Fix: The player with the Highest Ops Headline Event determines (chooses) initiative that turn; If playing an opponent's Event get +1 to Ops value for this decision only. Dice off ties.
 
 
14) Issue: Your luck sucks!
 
Fix: A. Alternating use of Re-roll chit which permits one re-roll by phasing player only. 
 
B. Allow the Active Player to purchase re-rolls with VPs, First Re-roll costs 1 VP, Second Re-roll costs 2 VPs, Third Re-roll 3 VPs and so on. Once the Re-roll option is declared any previous roll is invalidated and the VP(s) loss is applied before each Re-roll is taken and would cause Auto Loss if applicable.

After 2 1/2 hours we'd only just begun the mid-war and we had to wrap it up.  Though I must say the early-war was very fun.  The best thing about this game is the way Victory Points are scored by the scoring cards.  It means one player will know which zone is being scored and the other one just has to anticipate based on their actions.  I also really like how players have to figure out how to best use the cards in hand for each turn, whether to use Operation Points or events, and how to make your opponents cards have as little impact as possible.  Would love to play this often enough to get the playtime down to the 3 hour mark.
---
2nd play was a "full" game, but ended during turn 5 or 6 when USSR hit the 20 victory point mark mostly by Dominating Europe and Controlling the Middle East.  Stupid space race eating up all my cards...Still a fun game.
---
3rd play was also incomplete.  When am I going to get to play a full game?!?!
We did finish the Mid War, but had to wrap it up due to time before shuffling in the Late War cards.  The USSR spent a lot of its resources trying to Control Europe, but I was able to build Victory points elsewhere while keeping him at bay there.  A very fun game, I just wish it wasn't so long!  Realistically, it's 4 hours for your first few games, and it might drop to 3 after 6 or more plays I'd say.
---
4th play - The US (my brother) conceded just as the late war began because he felt he'd made too many uninformed decisions earlier in the game and knew that his defeat (and soon, dinner) was on the table.  I really like this game, but it's just too long to play the whole way through!

This game re-enacts the struggle of two super powers to gain control over smaller countries during the cold war.
Its main mechanics are somewhat (actually: very) simplistic, but they do the trick of modelling the powers' influence in the regions of the world. The scoring mechanism makes the game somewhat unpredictable, which adds quite a bit of excitement. However, the scoring harbours potential for imbalance, as it is entirely possible that the same player activates scoring repeatedly before the opponent can tip the scales in his favour. 

The main attraction of the game are the flavour titles of the action cards that refer to significant events of the cold war. These historical references save a game whose mechanisms in themselves are rather dull from mediocracy. 

Edit: In my opinion, this game is OK, but does NOT deserve #1 board game by any stretch of the imagination.

Lots of fun, highly thematic and offers loads of agonizing decisions.  I wouldn't consider this the deepest strategy game out there due to a high random factor (especially scoring cards), but that very same element forces players to rapidly change their strategy and adapt to uncertain situations.  The trickiest parts of the game seem to be managing the deck for later rounds while keeping your opponent continually off-balance.

Wow! I mean: wow! This is so fantastic game, I really don't know from where to start.

Theme, even though this is [b]just[/b] a game of card playing and are influence, is ubiquitous, I mean, it's everywhere. Every single card is assigned to a significant event in history, be it assassination of JFK or Karol Wojtyla being elected for a pope. History is exuding from everywhere in this game.

The game itself is very tight, full of bluffing and unexpected swings of fate. Card managing is crucial for efficient play and this is something you won't be able to do until you play few games - you have to predict what your opponent can potentially hold in his hand and be prepared to counter it. Without knowing the cards, you just grop around.

One of best games I've ever played. Highly recommended, if for some reason you haven't given it a try yet.

NOT A WARGAME!

initial high rating reduced due to card/combo tricks that are not intuitive, and reduce the ability for someone with limited play to compete.  Can you say Aldrich Ames/Lone Gunman?

based on several games were each player knew the deck, the outcome depends on how you roll on the space race, and when scoring cards come out (and who draws them).  managing the rest of your cards is certainly important (and interesting), but it is very easy to lose for reasons beyond your control.

ultimately sold because I didn't enjoy winning because I knew the deck more than my opponent.

Fast set up and play. Fun & strategic thinking.  
The rules are solid, there's no flaws looking for house rules anywere. 
The cards are interesting for their game functions as well as for their real meaning (These like the "Flower power" card).

After many plays it can become a true card-based game: it's important to know all the cards and what ones have been played. I don't like this, so I move down my rating a little.

The theme and tension in this game are fantastic.

Card driven mechanic works well and the balance of the game feels good for both sides.  There are lots of very tough decisions each round and every single play feels important.

The down side is that it is a very long game for non-war gamers to sit down for.  There is also a severe disadvantage while learning the game that, combined with the length, may scare some away or make it tough to introduce.  

It's fun, but not something that comes out to the table often.

It is a rare game that I still think about even days after playing. Man, I really blew round 2, or man I really nailed that scoring card in round 4. This is the type of response that this game creates for me.  It really is the ultimate 2 player strategy game. I am generally not a fan of pure strategy games like Chess because you really need players matched at the exact same level to have a thrilling match. This game sprinkles in just enough randomness to make each game entirely different amongst even regular opponents, while adding luck in the way the cards are managed and the dice based elements. It is really a perfect blend, and the theme is is integrated perfectly.

Once you get to know the cards the real fun begins because the game becomes even more strategic and less tactical, while it leans tactical as you are learning. It is possible for new players to at least compete against a mid level player, and a winning strategy can be developed after just a few games if you are willing to learn the cards. For a heavy 2 player game there is nothing I would rather play.

A splendid, splendid game, absolutely astounding design and great mechanics. The theme is full of well handled flavour, recent history buffs will be thrilled. Sometimes people do lose because of a bad hand or a deadly card combo, but usually there are ways to avoid those and they remain an infrequent enough occurrence.

Brilliant wargame for non-wargamers and wargamers alike. Theme is marvelous and well-integrated into the game, and the game is a blast. 
The game is not without problems, though. 1) It is imbalanced (heavily in favour of the Soviets); 2) There is a large experience factor in the game (know the deck and prosper); 3) It's really quite random. All of that having been said, TS is still brilliant.

RATING: 6
The game is a fun game with an interesting theme but there are some serious issues that go along with that detract from my rating of it. 

First, while not super complicated, there is a serious learning curve. This is not just rules, but also learning all the cards and combos. If you do not know the cards you have no chance at have a coherent game or strategy. This is a barrier to play and restricts who you can play with. If you have played a few times and want to play with someone new, the game won't be fun as they have no chance. You need to play with people of approximately equal skill.

Second, luck. I did not think going into this game, given that it is such a heavy game, that luck would be such a pervasive factor in deciding game outcomes. Certainly, card knowledge and smart play are important, luck can be overwhelming. If you draw bad card and your conversely your opponent draws well, you can have almost no chance. Say you get Red Scared twice in the first two shuffles of the deck you almost might as well quit. The luck is further compounded by dice rolls, but this is not nearly as important as card draws since this can be mitigated to a degree by better decision making.

Overall, the game is well made and the components are great, but its just that 1) its hard to get to the table so it would seem most people would be relegated to playing online, and 2) luck plays a tremendous roll in outcomes. It can be quite dissatisfying to invest so much time in a game at the end to feel as if you could have obtained the same outcome just by flipping a coin.

RATING: 8.5
Number 1/2 in BGGs all time rated games - cold war shenanigans as the USA and the USSR duke it out over 44 years of history to see who comes out on top in the struggle of collectivism against capitalism.

Two players only so it's got a lot in common with chess and draughts in planning moves out and reacting to the other player rather than following a formula.  Little complicated to first get your head around but you'll be glad when you do.

The game is probably 75% skill, 25% luck as you need to know to do...something at a certain time.  Repetitive play definitely helps.

Game loses an entire point for a badly written instruction manual.  Can't you people afford editors?

RATING: 9
A highly enjoyable game with simple rules supporting a deep game. Players from beginners to experts can enjoy this which is perhaps one of the reasons it is so popular.

If you enjoy a game with agonising decisions and the feeling of tension throughout this is well worth a look.

I have introduced it to about 5 people now and every one enjoyed it and would like to play again. This is the only game in my collection where that has happened.

The only reason it is not a 10 is because there are other longer games I would play given a choice. The short play time of this gets it on the table quite often.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
This game is absurd.  There is nothing to love here, and I can't comprehend the amorous feelings BGG has towards this game.  It has stood the test of time, with over 23,000 reviews so I know that it isn't just "oh some people like it, and some people don't".  This is a nearly universally loved title.

But I abhor it.  It's limited to strictly 2 players, which I thought might be great for playing with my wife.  Turns out its not.  This game is an exercise in futility and frustration.  Spend a card and an action to gain some influence in Europe, only to have the other player undo your action, repeat ad nauseum, until you unwillingly have to play the Europe Scoring card and give your opponent all of the points you were trying to earn.

The game takes forever too, which normally isn't an issue for me (I love Twilight Imperium 3), but for only two players, of which there is zero negotiating or bargaining, or really interaction, taking 180 minutes is unacceptable.

The components are utter garbage, and fiddly.  The game relies entirely too much on luck of the draw or a roll of the dice.  I own the physical version and the Steam version and have played a number of times on both platforms, trying to give this game a fair shot, and understand the hivemind.  But there is nothing fun, inspired, interesting, or engaging about this trash pile of card board.

Amazingly good and despite some differing reviews, a very balanced game indeed. The events are cool, the mechanics fit the theme perfectly, every round you are constantly scanning the board with delight trying to find the best spots for sowing the seeds of discontent against the opposing faction. Immersive, fun, tense, agonizing and really harsh to beginners, if the instructor has 3+ games under his/her belt. But don't let that stop you, it's too good to be missed because of a couple unavoidable beatings.

A really great use of the CDG system and by far the best treatment of the cold war wargamers have.   This is a game thats simple, fast, but pretty deep.  You will not get tired of playing this.  It captures a lot of what makes card driven wargames great without all the rulebook flipping and exception riddled player aids.  Great production values, although the price point is high for only one map and one sheet of counters.  Also, at times an unlucky card draw can get annoying.  This is worse than in other more complex CDGs because in TS, you are often forced to use cards that will benefit your opponent.  Drives me crazy!  There is no worse feeling than drawing a scoring card for an area of the world the other player has locked down, knowing that you are stuck playing it even though it could result in your losing.  The game also has some little balance quirks as many have noted here.  It seems to favor USSR early and the USA late, which results in a net benefit for the soviets.  I don't think its a big enough deal to get excited about.  H:RvC is more balanced.  You can always bid for sides to balance things out.  The game is so simple and well-designed.  A definite for anyone who grew up in the Reagan era.

Quick and fun. I guess it is balanced, cause while some tell that it is pro-USSR, we saw nearly all times an US victory.

Poor: CDG Strategic - Modern - Easy 

Plus:
-Theme
-Cards
-Accessible
-Time
Minus:
-Board
-Counters
-Cards of later decks used less often

The only things that bother me and takes away a point each:
1) The late war cards are not often played while the early war cards keep coming back often.
2) Space track is a casino ride: the luckiest wins
3) First edition map / counters but 2nd edition addressed this.

I immediately purchased the game after a friend introduced it to me. This was a fantastic experience with fast yet deep gameplay. The theme, the cards, the mechanics are very good at first glance.
Burn bad cards on the space programme, undertake a coup attempt before your opponent plays a scoring card, trigger events. A lot to think about and that with only 9 pages of rules This system promises more of these types of games in the future. 

After a while it takes a bit long before you rreach late war although experienced players who know exactly what to do can throw cards quicker than their minds. 

Revisited: don't care much to play this one.

Power, influence, balance.  What more can you ask for?  This might become a 10 if I play it a few more times.  Alex did win as USA in the 7 turn.  I have won as Russia twice.  It seems if you can not use the event and let it recycle back, you get a higher likely hood of good event cards.

Also, don't forget to coup a lot to get those military points (these can add up against you if you don't pay attention.).

I had this game at a 7 for a long time. However, once the iPad app came out and I played it enough times, the richness of the game came out.

A great battle of intelligence.  While being a good system, the area majority is a little dry.  Card play though, is amazing.  Theme is only there if you know the event that each of the cards is referring too.

It's kind of odd that the really simple rules seem hard to keep straight at times.

RATING: 5
Wonderful system and lovely concept, but too much randomness has made me lower my rating more and more.

The VP track can see tidal changes in a single turn, especially when you get too many scoring cards or your opponent gets some powerful combos such as Red Scare+Blockade, Muslim Revolutions+OPEP, and some others.

Moreover, the first 3-4 turns are completely unbalanced in favour of the USSR. Thus, too many games finish with a Soviet automatic victory in an hour or so.

Finally, it's a game especially tough on newbies. Unless you know all the cards and their interactions by heart, an skilled player is going to wipe you out of the board.

IMHO, the 2nd edition tried to solve some of the above issues but this game still needs some serious redesign to reach its full potential.

The theme is really engrossing, the rules are simple and crystal clear.However, for that kind of price, I would expect better cards, better pawns (I plan to replace counters with little red and blue dice, but really for that much money the components should be ok out of the box), better art. The box seems to be extremely sturdy... in fact the box is quality wise the best component of the game.The randomness factor is a bit high for my tastes, but ok for that type of wargamish game.However, it is an original game and I have had a good time each time I played.  It deserves a better edition.edit: does not deserve #4 spot I think. The first five or so games were much fun, but it still last long, much too long for what it is. The imbalance becomes more and more blatant, an US win is possible only when luck is on its side.

[url]http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/240085[/url]

update: I do not want to play again; in retrospect, I only like the idea of that game and none of the execution.
It all comes to this: do you like to memorize all the cards in a game?  Many games reward that, and if it is your cup of tea, and if you have a similar-minded partner, and if you do not mind the luck, than maybe you'll like this.  It's not for me anyway.

Rating may be a little low, as I've only played a single game as the US and was literally wiped out by the USSR player by turn #4, and he appeared to do so effortlessly...

It would seem that although we were both new (we were initially coached by a avid fan of the game), he grasped something I did not, which resulted in my demise.  The part I missed was how the cards get recycled back into the deck, and that one is better off not playing his events.  You see, the game is all about doing the right thing at the right time, and preventing your opponent from doing the same.  In order to have a good grasp of this game, one needs to be aware of all the cards, as well as their impact.  I'm pretty sure my rating will go up after I've played this a few more times.

Fantastic epic game of risk management. I'm not much of a history buff, so I'm less concerned about how well the game emulates history books, but the game effectively lays out conditions for a fantastic tug-of-war. Furthermore, while the game is complex, it is not mechanistically so (sure, it helps to have an idea of what some of the cards do and where it might occur). Overall, great game. Rating likely to go up with more plays.

Wanted this to fill a need for a longer, heartier two-player game.  It fills that need perfectly.  Players should have similar experience levels. The player with no knowledge of the cards will get creamed by the player who has them memorized.

Super heavy 2 player war/area control game which is essentially cold war in a box. Super thematic, super strategic an while it appears daunting, is actually easy to learn. Any cold war buff, should try this and any strategic gamer should as well

Possibly my favorite game.  The mechanics, map and influence, and card-driven manipulation add up to make an extremely stressful and mind-numbing experience every time I play.

Nice enjoyable game with an √ºber-theme.. but.

This is a game, for wich you need to "study". Meaning sure you can just play it off the bat.. but the player who "studied" the game even a little will win.

That might be appealing to some, for me this is a drawback.. because although i enjoy learning the intricacies of a game SYSTEM, i don't like to memorize the ramifications of each and every of the app. 100 cards in the game.
Meaning there is a pre-defined way of playing this, from wich you can deviate only little.

Example: as the USA you need to know that there is a Japan card that gives you Japan on a plate.. otherwise you waste ressources on it. That is just one of many cards you have to know in order to make sound decisions.

This game is an indepth wargame focusing on the political workings of building influence in different countries and gaining victory points through the amount of influence in each country and how far your country is in the space race without going into Nuclear War. I love this game even if I feel like my head is going to explode. It's always tense because of the variety of options and the ability to stay close in points to the opponent.

Apparently one of the highest ranking war games of all time, if not the highest. I have to admit that premise couldn't go much higher: two player game in which one player is playing as USA and another player as Soviet Union in the heated years of Cold War. There's everything in this game: politics, war, scheming, star wars, propaganda and a possible ending in nuclear war.... Spooky. Must say I am building courage to play this. It will be a huge undertaking to learn this game on basics and then learn any winning tactics.

Possibly the best game I've ever played.  The biggest negative I have with it is that it is for only two players and I can never find anyone to play with me.  There can be some huge luck based swings with coups but that's not enough to make feel the game is flawed.  

Games can take a while but for me there is something satisfying with playing a 3 hour game and winning by one point, which I have done a couple times.

In my opinion, this game is near perfect.  It's almost like Go in how simple the basic game of playing influence is.  It takes a few days of playing to understand the rules, and to understand the various traps a player can fall into that will cost him a game, but games are always exciting. The only thing I have an issue with are the 'water-stains' on the artwork for the board.

Solid, light area control game, disguised in a war theme. I'd probably enjoy the game more if I had to play a smaller percentage of the cards in my hand, probably by holding a few extras from turn to turn.

RATING: 7.5
Very good game but it takes a few turns before you fully understand the scoring - I was 8 points behind by turn 3 so instead pushed for control of Europe which was nearly there but not in time.

Overall the mechanics, card design, historical nuances and general feel of it all are all exceptional. I would love to play this again and again.

However when would I? It wouldn't be playable with my mum, housemate or other non gaming friends. Chris would love it but we'd only play once a year. Bringing 2player games to club/LOB isn't an option and Mark has a copy in GY

On balance I simultaneously really want a copy and also know that buying it is not sensible

RATING: 7
(06/08/2014) Comment based on 1 complete and 1 aborted play.

This is a intense card-managment game, with a tightly knit geo-spatial element, that convincingly conveys the Cold War.

On the surface, the simplicity of expanding influence on the global map through operational points on dealt cards makes this game feel seemingly trivial. However, each card also has an actual Cold War event that can be triggered if the active player chooses, if the card is favorable to them, or acted upon by the passive player, if it is not. The card deck is divided into three periods of the Cold War, with a number of turns within each. Cards can be played for operation points (to get influence onto the board), which can potentially be recycled to be played later, or played for the effect of the event, where the card is permanently removed from the game.

Each player will be dealt a hand of cards, of which some will be favorable or unfavorable to that player. That is, the Soviet player has cards that are good for them, and likewise for the U.S. player. At some point in the turn, the Soviet or U.S. player will be forced to play a card that triggers an event favorable to the other side. The game then becomes a matter of setting up the board to mitigate the event, or timing the play to lessen the effectiveness. Additionally, one card could be discarded to make a random roll attempt at progressing in the space race.

More cards from the middle and late periods will come into play eventually, and the players will continually need to do "damage control", as the balance of power shifts back-and-forth on the global map. As such, actual events will be triggered, altering the game state substantially, although they may not necessarily come out in chronologically accurate order. Nevertheless, the feel of the period is conveyed nicely through events, equally dishing out jubilation and frustration for the players.

When distilled to the basics, one cannot help but feel this is a game of card-driven "pissing contests" all over the map. If the Soviet player grows influence in an area of the world, the U.S. player needs to react, and vice-versa, otherwise a potentially devastating scoring action card may occur, a number of which are randomly seeded throughout the deck. In retrospect, the Cold War was essentially a game of cat-and-mouse, and of tempo, much like Go. In that, the design succeeds providing lots of tension and as a historical simulation, but as a game, I found it somewhat boring because I could see right through the theme and see the rather unsophisticated game mechanisms underneath. Still, it was interesting to see how historical events sort of appeared chronologically, while allowing the players enough freedom to experience completely unthinkable alternate histories. Perhaps, if I was willing to let myself get lost in the theme, I would enjoy it more. Initial rating: "7", with room to move up.

If any game I own deserves a ten it is this one. This game keeps you engaged and on edge through the entire game.It has near perfect amounts of complexity, strategy and luck. What I mean is it is just as complex as it needs to be, has just the right amount of luck factor to keep it interesting, but the luck is mitigated by good tactical decisions and strategy as well as knowledge of the game. This truly is a game you can play over and over and try different things each time. You can grow with this game and you find yourself wanting to come back again and again.

My first play of this game was a mildly unpleasant experience leavened somewhat by winning big. My head was spinning due to unfamiliarity with every aspect, including, sad to say, much of the history. 

A very clever, well designed and produced game that deserves its many accolades, but is far from my preferences.  I detest the prospect of the learning curve against my likely opponents' honed skills; an issue I have with all CDGs, which by their very nature require deck-specific knowledge.

It's interesting, however, it's to hard to teach others playing with me. I always need more than 30 minutes teaching them before I can play with them. What's more, you must know almost all the cards for the better playing experience, which makes it impossible to have a good time with the newbie.
And I think the digital version in iPad is wonderful, the turtorial is comprehensive and you can play against AI to get familiar with the cards in the game. There is only one disadvantage in the digital version, which is that the AI is so weak, I win in mid war almost every time, so I don't have enough chance to get familiar with the cards in the later war.

A bit unsure about this game - learning curve seems quite steep (knowing the cards...) I prefer the learning curve to be discovering deeper strategies with a simple rule set (i.e., Go or Tigris & Euphrates) rather than knowing which cards are coming up in the deck.

It seems to me that this game is enjoyable to play only if you know all the cards and the phase they will show up. I think this is a bigger is Also the game mechanics felt a little bit counter-intuative and luck driven. Before next try I'll have to study the cards carefully. Because the theme is very interesting I am actually quite interested to study the cards to learn more about the history. I am quite certain that I'll upgrade my rating to '8' after full game.

This is the best game I've ever played!!

It may not a be a love at first sight. I bought it and it spent like two months on the shelf without being played. Then I discovered www.twilightstrategy.com and I started getting into it. Since then I taught many friends not only the rules but, most importantly, the strategy basics. Since then we organized between us leagues and championships and our love for the game started to grow stronger with every play. We even have like a top ten highlights and love to watch the games we don't play to learn from our opponents and see how they play! I won't ever forget games like the one were I was a bit behind on the score and strategic situation but then, outguessing my opponent, I put it against the ropes with a single move perfectly timed!!! 

If you are a heavy strategy or power gamer and you like to master games untill you beat every single opponent using different and clever strategies and also identifying those of your opponents, trying not to fall into their traps by knowing the game better than them and all that, give this a try. You may have to spend some time but, for me, is definitely worth the effort. If you are lucky to have some kind of mentor give him the opportunity to teach you and maybe, some day, the student will beat the master.

I realize I'm in the minority on this game. (I also don't think it is a wargame.) I think it is competent with some nifty mechanics (especially how playing cards triggers your opponent's events) but the theme isn't terribly appealing to me. Too often the game ends in mid-war. Knowing every card in the game by heart is crucial to half-decent play, leading to lots of "gotcha" moments that destroy your hour of careful planning. The realignment mechanic seems poorly integrated -- in my plays it has hardly ever happened.

And, like virtually all CDGs, the historical event deck leads to totally ahistoric play. I've never understood why CDGs and their fans think that is The One True Way(tm). "You can't have made up events!" But having Japan fall to the Communists in 1955 or Cuba taken by the Americans in the 1970s is totally okay. Make up your mind whether you want slavish devotion to historical re-enactment or a fun game!

I enjoy this, but I think it is overrated.  Like all card driven games, the learning curve is steep.  Like all historical games, it works best when you're interested in the theme.  It is possible for the card draw to leave you at a significant disadvantage, but many argue that the game is designed to make it feel like that.  Despite this, the area control mechanics are very good and suit the theme well.  Some games can go on *way* too long.  Twilight Struggle is definitely an "experience" game.

The only reason I'd turn down a play of this game is lack of time, or because I don't want something THIS involved.  I've played three times (9/07) and it's been fun each time.  For some reason, it's exhausting.

After just one play, I thought this was a bit average.  I prefer CDGs with some combat.  I didn't think the effort to play was rewarded.

The second play was a real Struggle & not in a good way - we were both bored & kept hoping it would get better.  The game ended in a draw.

I'm over this game.  Have to rate it a 1 - I would refuse to play again.

This sat on my shelf for almost a year, as I had no one among my constellation of gamers who would play with me. Finally deciding to set it up and play solo. While it doesn't really "work" as a solo game, in that the secrecy factor is a significant part of the game, I can say the experience was simply fantastic. What a deep, meaningful, educational, rewarding and fun experience!  My deepest worry was that a whole bunch of fiddly rules and constant rulebook exploration would mar the experience. This is not the case. The game is straightforward, and rules are very clean and easy to master. The tough part is in the strategic game play itself, and employing events to your advantage - optimizing your superpower's benefits while minimizing damage of events not in your favor. This is, simply, the best game I have ever played, bar none.

Anne's.  A good 2 player card driven wargame.

RATING: 7
This is the CDG that non-wargamers can be persuaded to play. Mechanically simple, the selling point is really the atmosphere generated by the superb choice of events: Missile Envy, How I Learned to Stop Worrying, etc., but they constantly generate lasting effects that are easy to forget when involved in the action.
The weakness of the design is the combination of a single draw deck with the opponent's-event-happens-anyway mechanism that makes the whole game massively random and swingy, especially so given the random timing of the scoring cards. Playing time is also an issue, this runs much closer to 5 hours than 3 if it lasts the full 10 turns and one side doesn't get an early blowout win.
That issue of balance is a bigger problem than it ought to be. Too many games are one-sided leaving a player to chase the game for turn after turn if the run of cards goes in the other's favour, indeed the WarGames card seems specifically designed to end such misery a turn or two early. Maybe one game in ten is close enough to go to final scoring.
So ultimately, this game is a triumph of theme over randomness. It's like a ride on the fairground dodgems: you get the illusion of control and enjoy the thrill, but where you go is almost completely unpredictable. History/politics/conflict is my favourite gaming theme and I really, really want to like this, but I keep my copy solely for those occasions when I feel like something lighter in a CDG and don't want to think too hard. In the final analysis this is a narrative game (albeit a good one) and there's no point in feeling disappointed about losing.

This is a top 50 game from my personal Top 100 list.  It is one of the few 2-player games on my list.  Twilight Struggle uses a nice card-driven action point system that has a nice balance.

The game is easily engaging for both players from start to finish even with the games variable length.

RATING: 9
An overly complicated rulebook hiding a fairly simple game at heart.  Always leaves me wanting to play again and the random card distribution ensures that each game is different - although the same events will always come up, just not in the same order.  If you remember the time, the cards are very evocative of the major events, and if not, the game gives a good idea of the ideological Cold War fought on a global scale in the latter half of the 20th Century.

It's not a wargame, but it is a propaganda battle with the future of the world at stake.

Remember to win not with a bang, but with a whimper.

I had this rated lower, after my first play dragged on and on with little impact. I really need to play it more to have a better idea of what I like and dislike about it.

The only thing keeping it from a 10 is the dice rolls: there are few enough of them that a bad run of luck (for example, on the Space Race) can have a disproportionate effect on the game.

PbeM suitability: very high, although in some ways the level of automation in the Vassal module is actually a barrier to efficient play (e.g. the need for each side to activate its own headline event, even when there's no actual decision to be made as to their effects). I guarantee someone will forget to advance the turn marker at some point.

RATING: 10
Historical strategy game about the Cold War.  Not really a wargame, although some will call it that.  Simple game with amazing depth, excellent historical narrative, and outstanding gameplay.  Most historical games either fail to deliver a strong narrative or suffer in gameplay (if not both), but Twilight Struggle nails both.  Gameplay moves quickly while offering numerous decision points that have at least some connection with history.  The Cold War really comes alive when playing this game.  Even when winning the game, a player can at times feel like the whole world is about to collapse.  Gameplay is derived from the We the People system, but the military units are abstracted out.  I avoided this game at first thinking that this would not work, but I was very, very, wrong.  There are still plenty of choices, like placing influence (foreign aid, improving relations, and such), attempting coups to overthrow hostile governments, and playing event cards, which cover almost all of the major events of the period, including the hot wars.  Minor imperfections include a bit too much randomness, some of which seems unnecessary.  (The worst offender here is the die roll on the space race track.  I'm not sure what this brings to the table other than making a moon landing nearly impossible, which damages the historical narrative of this particular mechanic.)  I'm also not excited about the gaminess of the deck management, where players may delay playing historical events to keep favorable cards in the deck (shades of Paths of Glory here).  Still, these are minor concerns and easily rectified by house rules by those seeking a bit stronger historical narrative.  One of the finest historical strategy games ever made.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I have now played it a few more times and I have to say that I love the game.  It gives a great feel of the cold war, with the events, having to react to the opponent with out knowing exactly what they are doing, etc.

It is a game that I think about for hours after I play, which is a sign of a great game.

RATING: 8
Very strong strategic game, theme is also well integrated and historically informative. My major criticism is that it is not something you can introduce to someone new, it will take them many games to catch up and the whole time you will destroy them. So if you want to own this game, make sure you have a partner in mind that is your strategic equal and plan to play it lots.

Es un juego ambientado en la Guerra Fr√≠a que usa control de √°reas con un motor de cartas que a√±ade mucha solidez al sistema. Quiz√° el mejor que he probado (o al menos con tan buenas sensaciones como la Guerra del Anillo). Lo que le hace sobresalir entre otros CDG es su capacidad de proporcionar accesibilidad y facilidad de reglamento sin sacrificar detalles hist√≥ricos, riqueza y narraci√≥n. 

La mec√°nica gracias a la cual las cartas con "buenos" eventos te ayudan poco porque no lo desencadenan y las "malas" te ayudan algo, pero desencadenan el evento. Esto es lo que m√°s me gusta, aunque tambi√©n a√±ade puntos que sea un wargame sin guerra :)

Adem√°s hay que tomar muchas decisiones en un turno (elegir la carta de cabecera, la carta que conservar√°s hasta el siguiente turno, o si usar una carta como operaciones o como evento).

Sus principales cr√≠ticas las dirijo hacia el elevado conocimiento que hay que tener de todas las cartas para jugar de manera adecuada y la implicaci√≥n de la suerte en el proceso (se tiran dados en las mec√°nicas de resoluci√≥n de conflictos). Todo esto en un juego que puede llegar a las 3 horas hace que la inversi√≥n en tiempo y esfuerzo para disfrutarlo, le haga quedarse con la nota que tiene ahora mismo (algo menos de un 7) sin llegar a ser un juego sobresaliente.

The only problem is finding someone to play it with, as it is definitely a commitment.

Probably wasn't ever going to get it played again. Seemed cool, but not the kind of thing my wife and I would dedicate ourselves to really learning. Traded away with a bunch of other stuff for a pile of Warhammer: Invasion cards.

Played again some years later. Ok game, but perhaps a tad tedious and repetitive. Will be open to playing a couple more times before making a final judgement, but for the 2 player epic battle I prefer War of the Ring.

Great game.  Amazing use of historical events.  It's long, somewhat heavy, and you really need to be in the mood.  It's certainly not something I'd play every weekend.  But it's in my collection because I really do enjoy it once in a while.

There are better (for me) CDGs out there, but there are also worse.  I love most every GMT CDG I've played. but this one and 1989 fall completely flat for me, and I can't really explain why.  Both these games just feel a bit long, and I get bored after a very short time.  I love long games, but at 4.5 hours or so, I'd much rather play WotR or Hannibal or Unhappy King Charles! or two games of Labyrinth, or just about anything else.

Addendum:  most overrated CDG ever?  I think maybe so.  At the #1 game in all three categories at BGG (at one time), It's definitely the most overrated game ever.

So after hearing about the rave reviews and hype pretty much everywhere, I reluctantly gave into a game.  I'm a bit sorry I did, because what a BORING mess of a game Twilight Struggle turned out to be.  If you like card driven games about adding numbers systematically to a flow chart in the guise of a cold war themed "wargame," then look no further.  Area control has been done much, much better elsewhere and with twenty times the level of engagement and excitement.  I think this game was designed too much by the numbers and suffers for it.  I'm actually pretty shocked by how well it's been recieved and wonder just how in the minority I'm in.  I would have to be seriously talked into another game before I gave it a second chance.  The theme can't be that compelling to overlook the serious flaws in this game, can it?

I looked up boring in my Thesaurus and found the synonyms to fit my exact diagnosis perfectly.  Here they are in their entirety: uninteresting, dull, tedious, dreary, lackluster, monotonous, mind-numbing, tiresome, unexciting.

Maybe I was a bit too harsh...

RATING: 8
Highly interactive game of tempo management. The parts that aren't about tempo management seem to be based around exploiting your knowledge of the card decks to build board states that will either add or subtract effectiveness from different events.

Conceptually, I love the game. It manages to feel historical by having callbacks to the big turning points of the war, without letting it devolve into flag waving for either bloc. Both sides come out looking like massive conglomerations of manipulative sociopaths. You will stage coups in countries whose names you can barely pronounce, purely because your opponent went there, and now you need to go there too.

I'm less than sold on the amount of random chance in the game. I like that each side will have hands that are awkward, and I also like that you can take some hits early on to sculpt the deck more to your liking in later stages. That said, some swings can end up robbing the game of tension, rather than adding to it. Specifically, I feel like one person getting significantly more scoring cards in hand can be a pretty big disadvantage. Yes, you gain some utility in being able to control when the scoring takes place, but if you get a hand with two or three scoring cards in the mid-war period, it can feel pretty horrific.

I have about 8-10 other games of this that I didn't log. I generally play with 2 extra influence to the US at game start, and optional cards added.

Brilliant game concept and design.  My sense after one game is that you need to put in a few plays to learn the cards (and some of the special situations that could be exploited by particular cards).  Once you learn what the game can do (and have an opponent who also has equivalent exposure), this game could have legs for a really long time.

The designer's ability to capture actual historical events and have them unfold at relatively appropriate times conveys a wonderful sense of the real Cold War.

Maybe this game gets magical after one learns its cards and intricacies, but the first plays of the game feel a little more "gotcha" than I'd prefer; I don't appreciate a game that rewards memorization of cards from previous plays giving experienced players the advantage. Besides that, the game is tight, and introduces the CDG-style wargame idea quite well.

Maybe I'll become as excited as so many have been about Twilight Struggle after more plays; but it's hard to get this one to the table to be honest.

Had a chance to play this over spring break. While the setting and conditions were ideal (plenty of time and beautiful spring day on a porch), the game left me more tired and worn than anything else. While I really enjoy the historical element, the constant subtracting and adding of status points, the management of the board, and the time involvement proved to be obstacles too large to overcome. Time ticked on rather than quickly passing by because of its immersive quality. While I can appreciate the design, I don't think I would want to play the game again which determines my low rating.

SO SO tense. I've played it only once, but it was possibly one of the best experiences of my young gaming life. The entire game was a tense tug-of-war, with victory still not determined until literally the final moments of the final turn. I lost by three points but, had one play been different, I would have won by one.

(1/20/09)I've got to go and give this one a 10.  Its just an all around outstanding game.  There was so much hype going into playing this one from me and the game lived up to it.  I was worried if my dad would like it and he recieved it well also.  He's getting the hang of it now, too! (I beat him pretty badly the first 3 games but now in our last game he beat me by 1 point after turn 10).

This feels like a wargame, but one that may be very accessible to eurogamesrs because it plays like an area influence game.  It features a playing time of 3-4 hours for experienced players (faster if there is an early winner) and low rules overhead.  Game play is fluid and tense with the advantage swinging from side to side throughout the game.  The theme is excellently implemented and feels fresh in that there are only a few other games out there about the cold war.  The game is a bit luck dependent (for example, if one player draws the majority of the scoring cards, they control when the majority of scoring occurs, and this is a major advantage).  (I own the collectors edition plus an older edition.  I bumped .5 for the collector's edition version)

another good game - but again with the randomness. last game we played, I was USSR and had the US back against the wall almost the whole time. thinking the USSR is stronger in the beginning, I opted for the US this time but bad dice rolls on USSR's part and a seeming endless good supply of cards for the US (in retrospect) seemed to contribute more to the win than any decisions made. maybe this is just part of the game, but i'd like to think that the randomness is not such a huge component that it's equally lucky each player should have the same chance to win at the beginning, regardless of how the game unfolds. it's too much of a time commitment for that... 1960 here I come.

An easy game to learn. The game play feels fresh and original, and although it is strategy and warfare, it does not feel military or tactical like a game of Tide of Iron or other war games.

I like some wargames, but I pretty much consider myself a eurogamer, and one of the things I love about Twilight Struggle is the elegance of the game's rules and flow. But mostly I just love, love, love the theme, and the way it is shows in the tension that you feel throughout the game. 

I rated this a 10 for years, but lowered it to a 9 after realizing that over-familiarity with the game (due largely to playing online) was taking away some of the fun; keeping track of what's been played gives a major advantage but reduces the element of surprise, which is one of the things I like about the game. The good news is that after taking some time away from the game and coming back to it, it's feeling kinda new again.

Twilight Struggle has, without doubt, a great theme. It also has some very interesting and, it seems to me, original mechanics. The games I have played have been great fun thanks, in particular, to the cards which do a fine job of integrating the theme with the game itself. I have not seen any evidence of a balance problem between the USSR and USA. There may be an issue of balance between game length and the impact of chance, but even after several plays I can't say that it has been a problem. Anyway, Twilight Struggle occupies a previously empty niche in the boardgaming world or, at the very least, in my game collection. As such it has and will continue to receive some considerable attention from me.

absolutely lives up to its reputation

update - no it doesn't.  It's way imbalanced if the luck doesn't get close to balance out for you.  The coup rolls are insanely good.  Cuba should be invulnerable to coup/re-alignment if Fidel takes over unless another card (Bay of Pigs) is played AND succeeds...lets be realistic...the US NEVER touched him, not even to this day.

It took us until our fourth game to get past the fourth turn.  In the fourth game we finally made it all ten turns.  Excellent game with amazing theme.  The dice are a killer though, and on rare occasion can ruin a game.  The fact that I am giving a game with dice a rating this high is a huge testament to the quality of this game.  A single session can be amazingly fun or kind of dull depending on how it plays out, but it is a really fun game on average.

This one has taken me a few games to start realizing how to play it.  It is so well done that after playing and losing very badly, I bought a copy for myself 10 minutes later.  It is a dry-er game and only being 2 players, it will not be brought out in group sessions at all.  Overall, I still want to play it right now though!

The only problem with the game is one of its strengths (the cards).  One game I played my opponent had 7 points.  The next turn he drew 2 scoring cards, 4 of my events and 2 low ops cards for himself.  That turn I was able to score 14 points and never looked back.  The game can be over by turn 3 (I lost in the headline phase of turn 3 once) or go the distance of 10 rounds (with victory in grasps of both players).

My first foray into the CDG genre, this game was a very pleasant surprise that my non-wargaming wife even liked.  The cold war history is interesting and the game presents you with a number of difficult choices.  Those seeking the breakout of a "hot" war need not apply.  The game even elegantly incorporates the fear of mutually assured destruction by limiting players aggressive actions with a DEFCON track.  This tends to push players towards a more historic balancing act rather than the all-out nuclear struggle that often erupts in other wargames covering the period.

Loses a point due to some of the randomness and the Bear Trap/Quagmires card, which are way too random for a game that's already this random.

For me, this is one the top 3 or 4 two-players game. It has it all: complexity, asymmetric game, conquest, back and forth mechanic, highly thematic and, the one thing that I most enjoy, the fact that, throughout the game, you are going to play many cards that are going to trigger enemy's events that are going to be extremely painful for your interests but, no matter what, you need to play them. Let's sacrifice Africa for the greater good of Southeastern Asia. Amazing.
The game is the cold war in a box. That's it. I would say that it has every major event that happened during those years: from space race, to revolts, to particular war events to main characters that had major roles.
Positive:
1. How thematic it is
2. What do you have so sacrifice in order to achieve some benefit
3. The action-reaction structure of the game: if we fight for Europe let's put everything there, but if I go now to Asia you should be consider expanding your forces over the map
Negative:
1. Requires playing some games until you are really competitive. There are many cards that you need to know that exist on the deck and in which phase will appear (early, mid or late war)
2. Early war is mainly favorable to URSS player, if the American player does not know how to survive those years, the game may not get to Mid war
3. The tablet version works so well that it may replace the board version

Mind-blowing...

Great mechanics, great climate, great emotions...

EDIT: After 20+ plays some issues start to bother me:
- cards with useless events - always played for VPs and (almost) never as events
- routine/repeatable (optimal) patterns of play.  The replayability suffers.

Still, a very good game.

This game totally deserves the accolades it receives.  Twilight Struggle was easy to pick up as a person who doesn't play war games but immediately I was overwhelmed by the breadth of options gameplay provides.  This is a game that requires knowledge of every card.  It seems chaotic at first but there's an internal logic that allows expert players to predict upcoming cards.  This is a fine, fine game and the only negative point is that I'm just not a wargamer at heart.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
I love card and card driven games so I am already biased here. That aside, I do think this is a very well put together fun game but it might not quite reach top tier for me simply due to the amount of luck vs. time factor, maybe though, its close for sure. 

The luck in the space race really doesn't bother me (unlike some people) and seems to even out over the course of a game, really this is a dumping zone anyway and I find not critical to winning. The luck in the cards really doesn't bother me either as it is fun and agonizing trying to mitigate it through various ways which is more than possible, you can usually always find ways to slither out of trouble even with some pretty bad hands.  

The luck that DOES bother me is in the realignnment and coup rolls which can be quite important to winning, you could have things largely in your favour especially with a coup and then roll a lousy 1, this can happen a few times and it really sucks and brings back bad memories of things like A&A (also there isnt a lot of rolling here which is good but it also doesnt give the luck a chance to even out). These can be really important moves in the game with the timing of it as well so failing due to a few dice rolls in a 3 hour strategy game kinda stinks, I know my rating would be higher probably a 9 or even more less this one aspect. I might be looking at different ways to resolve these and if anyone has any good tried ideas please send me a geekmail.  

Other than this the theme is so well implemented and interesting, your strategic juices certainly get flowing and it is quite tense thoughout as you wonder what your opponent is up to and what scoring card he might have.  It can be tricky to be subtle but it is somewhat possible with some slight bluffing.  

One other note, I like the idea of bidding to be the USSR player, ie "I'll be USSR and give you 2 VP's", then your opponent must accept or go higher at say 3 VP's until someone accepts to be USA. It seems things are slanted a little too much in Russia's favour. 

[u]Update:[/u] I have some great ideas how to tweak the dice rolling, some I got from here like using the CC:E initiative card to re-roll but note for this I would say only to re-roll and NOT to make your opponent re-roll (to avoid too much back and forth). Also, can only be used for Coup and maybe Re-alignment, still need to test this and I have some others too.  

At any rate I am confident I can mitigate the luck factor of the dice 'just a little' and for me this will likely be rated a 9 with the dice aspect weakened (not removed). I really like the game but felt the dice were a little too important considering how strategic the rest of the game is, now I should be able to enjoy it to its fullest. On another note, after playing quite a few other wargames I realize how the luck here is pretty low in comparison! Give me card draws over dice anyday, really starting to hate dice.... :P

Absolutely blown away by the design of this game. The rules are very light for a "wargame" and there is a lot of tension in every decision you make. The game is essentially an exercise in tug of war between 2 players to dominate the right regions in the right time. Most of these cards outmaneuver one another. The only con that I can think of is the long playtime when new players are involved (cards reading and what not). I hope they continue to develop this game in the future.

In Twilight Struggle, players represent either the U.S.A or the U.S.S.R. during the Cold War. Each player attempts to spread his or her country's influence in key geopolitical regions throughout the world.  The game play consists of players using their hand of cards to stage coups, politically realign regions, increase their country's influence and/or trigger historical events, which may alter the balance in their favor or their opponents favor.  The action-point/event card mechanic creates tremendous tension, as you inevitably have to play a few cards each round that benefit your opponent.  The event cards really immerse the player's in the theme.  

This game is spectacular.

An epic game for two players. After having only played one game, I had to pick this up when I saw it on sale. I do not regret my purchase.

Not many games can I say that I have won only once in 10 or more plays, but that hasn't put me off of Twilight Struggle. On the contrary, I feel challenged every time I play. I like to review my play in my mind after a game and think how I could have done things differently or seen an opening I had left for my opponent.

I want to like this game more than I do.  I really love the theme.  I enjoy the back/forth area control chess match... But I fervently believe the game is unbalanced in the Russian favor.  I've got double digit plays and have never seen a US victory.  Before you start shouting that I haven't done my 'homework' on US strategy, it's not true.  I have.  I've read ALL the threads, suggestions, and tips for playing the US.  I know them, I know what "not" to do, and the Russians still win every time.  I think you need to either 1)get a little lucky as the US or 2)play a Russian player who makes mistakes.  The game is SO heavily favored towards the USSR that autovictories in the first 5 turns are not uncommon.  I believe that the US can win, I just don't think the US can survive any bad luck... be it card draw (early Europe scoring is bad), or dice, or whatever.  Perhaps a bidding mechanic can bring it back into line.  A recent thread on consim noted a tourney where the USSR victories were a bit over 2:1 vs US victories among experienced players.  I'd wager that tally gets worse in the Russian favor if either side is not so experienced (not playing 'optimally' as the US).  Regardless, I think there's a wonderful game inside here, I'm just tired of trying to create a US victory.

Everything everyone else who gave this a 9 or a 10 already said...

If it weren't for the card learning curve, I'd give this a 10. You need to know what each one does and when they occur. Also, the playing time is just a tad too long, but I don't know any way around that without degrading the game.

Edit after playing a lot more: Yes, I get that there's skill--the better player will win most of the time-- but there are critical rolls of the die at certain points that swing this too much to the ameritrash for my liking. Probability still means a percentage chance, yeah? Momentum is hard to fight. Watching your opponent waltz down the space race track, while you don't move. Botching a key coup. Blowing three alignment rolls in your favor. Watching your opponent roll a 6 for his coup and then getting shut out of a region you would have had easily if he had rolled a 1. Each thing by itself is likely recoverable, but a series of them to a player of your own skill level or better not so much.  So even if the luck "balances" out, it may do so after it doesn't matter.

And conversely it doesn't feel gratifying getting too much luck either. 

Even some of the best players have made comments here such as "luck is king". So you have to know how much luck you can tolerate.

The cards have about the right amount of luck and hand management, although you can look down at a disastrous deal just as you needed a good one most.

Again, I'm not arguing this game isn't heavily skilled. It is. And I rate it a 7. I like it when the luck is even.

If you have a high frustration tolerance, you will love this game. If you don't, you'll still be ok if the dice are fairly balanced. If you think die rolls = tension, you will love this game.

An absolutely great instant classic.  Can be a tad unbalanced (55% to 45% for USSR), but that's historical (and correctable with an experienced US player and/or bidding for sides).  Tons of tough choices, great replayability.  Its shorter cousin "1960" is awesome to and eliminates the dice rolls and is shorter.

Excellent game. Need to play more to learn how the cards interact. It's longer than I can usually play so it doesn't get played as much as I'd like to.

I would give it a 10 if not for the 3 hours one must commit to play.  As a result, the game does not come out as often as it should.  Otherwise, it's engaging and a fantastic competition.  Intelligent game play, perfect use of theme and high level of strategy.

RATING: 6
There is so much to like about Twilight Struggle, but what keeps me from having loving it is the amount of luck it introduces in the form of card draws and dice rolls. While the mechanic of having to play cards to help your opponent is riveting, the random card draws that determine who has to deal with this and how much skew the game. The same goes for the random draw of who gets scoring cards. More critically, the use of dice in this game makes no sense. It's frustrating to watch a strategy fall apart because an opponent rolled a certain way. Twilight Struggle is certainly a fierce game of tug-of-war, but the inclusion of such a strong degree of luck makes it a hard sell as potentially three-hour game.

It's like this isn't even a game anymore. It's an experience. Probably going to fade in popularity as the years pass, and kids grow up in a a world with no Cold War.

Has become one of my top games.  I haven't played any game similar to Twilight Struggle.  While it may be similar to some card-driven wargames, it's very different than the Euros I've played.  While there is definitely conflict in the game, it feels very indirect.  It's great to play a wargame where the movement of troops isn't a primary mechanic.

*Update:  Moved this up to a 9.  I'm now "always up for a game" of Twilight Struggle.  Brilliant game that seems to have a lot of replay value for me.

*Update 2:  Up to a 9.5 - it's fantastic.

I had a chance to start reading through the rules. This definitely looks like it might live up to its hype. I got a chance to play on Monday (7/30) with Bob and really enjoyed. The USSR was well ahead at the end of Turn 4 (19vp). I'm curious now if the game tends to lean toward the Soviets early and the Americans later.

I played again against Bob (9/30/07). I played as the Americans this time and won also.

RATING: 4
I really wanted to like this one, but the level of luck is just too high for a game that requires this much investment. The use of a six sided di to determine the success of important actions is annoying, and the consequences of a very bad hand can be devastating. I believe the assertions that superior play will win most of the time, but a two player game of this length should have very little luck.

It reminded me of the 1980s computer game "Balance of Power", which could be lost by going to DEFCON 1 and launching global thermonuclear war.  Very clever game and a wonderfully thematic treatment of the Cold War.  The production values are disappointing (first edition even has typos on the game board, e.g., "Replublic of China").

This is a very interesting game. The theme is very original and well presented. The game is physically nice, but I have a hard time digesting the soft map and thin tokens, especially for the price.

Ah, what a game. Growing tension. Careful contemplation as you formulate a strategy for dominating the map segment by segment and getting control of the right countries at the right time. The two and fro as you dominate a continent and then your opponent dominates another that you've probably neglected somewhat because your attention has been else where. It all keeps this one carefully balanced on a knife edge all the way through. The whole thing is wrapped in a rich and detailed theme that pulled a total novice like me into the history surrounding the events of the cold war. Someone really knew their stuff here and it shows. I rarely get an opportunity to play a 3 hour game of this but when I do it never disappoints.

RATING: 7.5
Low-complexity card-driven wargame / euro'ish area-control game on the Cold War. Components are the usual GMT quality (which isn't really saying a lot), and there's about a page worth of errata (not clarifications, mind you!) already, including some really embarrasing ones. Despite this, the game looks cool and I am very eager to give it a try.

I have generally shaken my head in frustration at the direction the card-driven line of games was going since my all-time favorite wargame, Hannibal: Generally longer, fiddlier and more complex from one game to the next. However, Twilight Struggle is definitely breaking that trend, and for that I am very grateful.

I have now tried the game once and my first impression is "nice". Not the best game I've tried, but certainly entertaining. Our game clocked in a 4¬Ω hours, but we might be able to shave about an hour off that with experience. After reading the rules, the game felt like it would be very abstract and area-control'ish, but in reality the theme felt rock solid and the game came across as much more of a regular wargame than I would have thought.

My rating is of course extremely preliminary, but I can easily see it going up if the game holds up well to a few more plays.

Update: 8 years later. :-) The game still holds up fine, and the GMT deluxe edition is very, very nice...!

This game does an amazing job of recreating the feel of the Cold War: at any given moment I may not understand what my opponent is doing, but I always feel compelled to interfere with his plans.

I haven't played this enough to be intimately familiar with the deck. I get the impression that the game will reach a new level of depth when I can anticipate (or simply fear) the moves my opponent might make.

Played once.  Lost near the end of turn four.  Nuclear Holocaust.  Oops!

The scope of this game is a bit overwhelming at first, and playing the game without knowing what all of the cards do is... interesting.

There's a lot of tension and back and forth action.

Seems like it'll speed up a lot with repeated play, without devolving in to a set of standard moves.  Nice!

I really don't get the hype on this. I think it is a good game but it¬¥s not Top 1 material. I believe both opponents have to have around the same skill level to really enjoy the game. Also there is a medium/high randomness in the cards that can bother some people.

The components are rather low quality.

I want to give it another chance to reevaluate my rating.

I grew up addicted to Balance of Power on my Apple II.  Twilight Struggle is a perfect application of a CDWG mechanic to a political balance of power game.  Every game seems to feature tension you could cut with a knife from turn one.  The application of opponents events on your card plays is brillant and creates the damned if you/damned if don't mentality through the whole game.  Its a series of constant tactical choices and bluffing/counterbluff.  If you have any interest in the politics of the period, don't hesitate to grab it.  Its simple to grasp but replayability only suffers with difference in player experience.

A game to be experienced, an oh-my-god-I'm-about-to-get-nuked thrill ride.  Slight luck issue with the cards, though skillful play can mitigate this to a great degree.  Space race rolls can be a worse problem -- need to play more games for those to even out.  (12/2008:  I'm convinced this isn't as much of a problem as I had thought due to the value of being able to discard 2-ops cards at lower levels on the Space Race track.)

For me this game's strength is its incredible complexity.  There are so many hot spots to manage on the world map.  Playing with experienced players the game takes on chess-like qualities.  Unfortunately I may have settled into a skill level at which I destroy newbies but lack the patience to maneuver with skilled players and suffer very frustrating defeats.

Very cool. A coldwar game. With more play it may become a favorite. 

Not a heavy wargame, not even a wargame in truth, but it definitely simulates the competition for influence and ideological ways of life on the world scale. This game may have to much randomness for some players, but I think it makes a very dynamic game and gives the events a lot of flow and dynamism.

I have always been interested in spy novels, the cold war, and the history of these events. This game has kind of given me an overarching view of the whole thing. I'm a child of the late cold war and some of these events really sunk home in me and made me think WW3 was coming.

I like this one a lot right now and really wish to play it more.

In my opinion, the best game ever designed (yet). A tense, engrossing 2-player game that keeps you immersed in it throughout. Played 9 games in 2 weeks, that's how good it is (for a 2-4 hour game). Games are usually unpredictable and "struggling" uphill against a stronger opponent is quite an experience. Requires some experience and knowledge of the cards in order to play a "proper" game. May look complex, but is really quite simple once you start playing it.

Simplest of the card driven games - no armies to worry about, just political influence which is handled in an area control manner, which seems to have broadened the audience beyind traditional wargamers - lucky GMT!

Like most CDGs deck knowledge is useful (don't expect to win your first game against an experienced player), but very absorbing with a lot of tricky decisions and a great sense of history. A lot of fun - I like it.

I really like the way this game feels. You do get into the theme, USSR vs USA. The events on the cards add meaning to what you're doing. The Korean war doesn't just feel like you're adding or taking away numbers. It feels like a battle for an influential province. 

Every play is an agonising choice, but the choice isn't paralysing. I'm not quite sure how they struck this balance, but the game flows beautifully. 

My only slight criticism is the use of dice.  I prefer as little luck as possible in my strategy games. But I understand you need some level of chance to keep this game from becoming formulaic and I can't think of a better way to resolve those events. And you can limit the effects of dice rolls by playing in certain ways.

EDIT: The more I play this game the better it gets and the more I appreciate the dice aspect of the game. 10/10

Simply a fantastic strategy game. I personally love the Cold War theme and love the historical notes in the rule book. The gameplay itself is enjoyable, with plenty of tough decisions having to be made and lasting roughly 3 hours it is nowhere near as long as other strategy games. The only two negatives I can think of are the seeming bias towards the USSR player, who can easily dominate in early rounds, and the fact it is slightly too difficult to fully grasp for the members of my family who I play it with.

This game really never entered my mind, but I started looking at it and it looked really interesting. Plus, I grew up during the 60's which was the mid-late end of the "cold war" and remember a lot of these events. I see it is #3 for boardgame rank (at the time I bought it). Must be good!! Then, at about that same time, I seen one for sale at CSW for only $7.50. So, I bought that used copy on Feb. 4, 2010 from a John Burtt at Consimworld. Good seller too.

Just played five sessions so far...and i can really sense it's a deep game after more plays. Very satisfied with the quality of the board game and the agonizing decision making process during game play! Will likely to alter the rating after more plays and will update it later. Highly recommended to gamer who loves brain-draining and yet highly tension card-driven cold war-theme board game. I'm beginning to see why it is ranked so high up in BGG. But prepared for longer than usual playing time, minimum a 3 hour game until gamer becomes an expert in playing it and knows most of the cards.

[Update 2/2/2017: After more than four years since I bought the game, TS remains one of the most enjoyable 2-P game I have. It is still a great game to play, with lots of tension, excitement, frustration (due to the bad cards in hand), anticipation, etc, basically lots of emotions when playing it. This is one of the best strategy game around and I can't recommend it more. Learn about it, test play it, and you will find a wonderful game in TS.

Only if this game had official solitaire variant like it's brother, Labyrinth, then it would have been automatic buy, but :(.

I would have to research how viable fan made solo variant is first before I decide to purchase this. But the theme is oh so flavorful! I would love to play this.

2017-04-16 - This is a really solid, card driven area control game. It's basically a multi-use card game with a very historical flavor. The rules are not complicated, but there is a pretty steep learning curve. Though not similar in mechanics, it evokes Chess a little too much to ever be one of my favorites.

RATING: 9
A good game needs to have some decision anguish. Having to decide what choice out of your available options you will take is where it really gets fun. Too much of this just gets frustrating. Twilight Struggle doesn't cross the line, but balances it. You want to be aggressive, but at the same time you want to counter your opponent. After three plays I am still getting the feel for this game, as opposed to many other games that I feel I know after just three plays. While it was fun after just one play, it is growing on me after each try.

Only gets a 7 because I just am not always in the mood for it.
Upgrading to 8.5 as it has grown even more on me over time. It really is a 9, but I don't 'always' want to play it.

Living in Washington, DC I have a lot of friends who like politics and history, but who aren't gamers.  Twilight Struggle is the PERFECT game for us to play.  The rules are fairly simple, but the gameplay is elegant, making it a good choice for non-gamers.  Everyone can relate to the characterful event cards, and we all have our favorite Cold War moment (Don't wait for the translation...).  I am very enthusiastic, and can't wait to play again!  UPDATE:  After a few more plays, Twilight Struggle has to join my small collection of 10s.  It's a fantastic game, full of theme, and I wish I were playing it right now.

RATING: 9.9
Amazing game and props to the devs for doing such an amazing job taking the real history of the largest bluffing and political game of all time (in real life) and putting it into a super fun, very playable epic dual. 

This game pits you as the USA or USSR against the other and completely has you on the edge of your seat. It's a constant roller coaster and the two players will be completely immersed in the gameplay. 

It's a complex and long game (think a timeframe similar to monopoly with children ~3hrs) however it is absolutely one of the best games of all time. It needs to be complex... You're recreating the cold war with Real Actual events people!!! WTF did you think it would be? Simple and easy to understand... Love what they did.

Only gripe apart from tedious setup and intricate rules (again, that was expected) is the sub par materials for the game. I actually recreated the entire board on a hardboard tabletop and bought chessex dice (red and yellow for USSR and red and blue for USA) so the gameplay wold be smoother and more clear. All I'm saying is a great game like this could at least deserve a collectors set with better materials and dice instead of the damn tokens :)

RATING: 9
Twilight Struggle immerses players in the Cold War era in a tense, relentless battle for political influence. Despite the many moving parts that fuel the game, the ruleset remains accessible and intuitive. The various uses of the cards provide limitless possibilities and an open decision space in which to formulate and execute your strategy. The timing and sequence of card play is crucial, and herein lies the beauty and angst of the game. The level of historical detail is dripping with theme, adding layers of credibility and enjoyment to the game. While luck plays a significant factor, it is an element both players must manage. This is a fantastic design that results in a memorable session every time.

Two-player Cold War-themed game in which US and USSR spread influence across the globe. Cards also let you attempt coups and win the space race. Easy to learn, strategy abounds... but a bad deal can really turn you off, especially when someone wins the game because of it.

PLUS: theme - history without being over-educational,  strategy
MINUS: luck in the card draw with a slight bias to the US

This is an outstanding game, and manages to stay near the top of my heap. Kudos to Matthews and Gupta for all the research and testing they must have done to produce it. If you are into espionage, politics, and Cold War history, you owe it to yourself to try this game. A tension-filled exercise in mitigating disaster. 

I've experienced enough now to see the USSR advantage that puts some people off the game. However, I don't mind it. I do think the Space Race track is slightly awkward--even if you make enough attempts at it to gain a significant lead, you don't really gain a reward commensurate with the effort required.

This game is SO clever. I understand why wargamers complain that this isn't a wargame though. I dont understand why that is a problem however.

This game is incredibly tense, I feel absolutely exhausted after a game - in a good way. Upped my rating after more plays

RATING: 7
Shoot. I really thought I'd love this game. I enjoy card-driven games and I enjoy area control games. How can I not love this game? 

Here, specifically are the aspects of the game that I think weaken the design:

1) Randomly shuffled scoring cards. The gameplay tends to gear up in a continent for an anticipated scoring card and then is abandoned because both players know the card will not return for a while. Scoring, and therefore gameplay decision making, is arbitrary.

2) Roll a die to advance in the space race? This mechanic is lame and feels out of place, and yet can bring strong benefits to the player that makes this roll.

3) Although you can play without it, the "instant win" card is another poor design decision that I need to mark the score down for. I did win playing this card my second time out, and we both looked at each other and yelled "LAME!" simultaneously.

It's not a bad game, but neither do I think it is as great as many here seem to think. I'm more than a little baffled by all the adoration, although I do recognize the impressiveness of re-engineering card-driven wargame mechanics into an area-control game.

Components? The board and counters are too thin, the cards too thick to shuffle and the dice too small. The box is sturdy and strong. Cheers for the box.

Este juego es espectacular, es un pulso continuo entre 2 jugadores durante 2-3 horas.

Los jugadores luchan por controlar tantos paises como puedan en continentes distintos, usando PO √≥ los eventos proporcionados por sus cartas.

Twilight Struggle tiene distintas maneras de puntuar, y eso es bueno. No puedes centrarte s√≥lo en una parte del mapa, ya que el juego te hace que tengas fijarte en todo... incrementando la tensi√≥n de los jugadores.

Muy buen juego, pero necesitar√°s conocer sus cartas en profundidad si quieres ganar.

This game is awesome, is a continious pulse between 2 players during 2-3 hours.

Players fight for controling as much countries as they can in different continents, using OP or events provided by thier cards.

Twilight Struggle has different scoring mechanics, and that's a good point. You can not be focus on one part of the map, this game forces you to keep an eye on everywhere... rising players panic.

Highly regarded and ranked, TS is a very thematic retelling of the Cold War. Its use of cards, defcon/military operations, coups, and realignments result in a tense and engaging 3 hour experience. The only issue I have is the scripted feeling that comes from the deck separation; however, it becomes less so once you hit mid-late war.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Rating based on about 20-25 plays, including four games in tournament play where you bid for side.  The game favors the Russian player in the early turns, but flips over towards the US player if you can survive that long.  The key decision a player faces each turn is how to handle those cards with opponents events on them -- play them to get them out of the game, dump them in the Space Race, delay the decision for a turn, burn the China Card (if you have it).  You are also forced to play the scoring cards, but often setting up for them telegraphs your next play to an astute opponent.  This is probably the best of the card-driven game that is kind of a cross-over between the wargame and Euro genres and while it's very good, at #3 on the current BGG ratings list, it's probably a bit overrated -- there's nothing truly unique or original there, just a good combination of mechanics from other games that truly replicate the era it's trying to simulate, as each turn you literally do seem to be on the brink on nuclear confrontation ...

I am playing Twilight Struggle on Steam but I would love to play anyone face to face.  In my experience, this is the best game to play with 2 people.  Seldom do you know who is winning until it is over.  The problem is, bringing a newbie up to speed.  They have to understand, they are likely going to lose 3 to 5 games before they understand enough to be able to win.  Just knowing the rules and the mechanics is not sufficient to play well.  You need playing experience.

When I first heard of this game I was totally uninterested - no interest at all in the cold war, or a game about it - give me wooden cubes and cards or dice and tanks any day of the week!  I even passed it up on a rare business trip to the US while browsing in a game store in Boston.
To humour a friend I played a game of it on-line on Vassal, where the implementation was a bit glitchy.
Despite the interface and my initial lack of enthusiasm for the subject, once into the first turn I was totally hooked - it was the game mechanics that hooked me, not the subject, but as a result of the game I have become interested in the history too - something I would not have predicted.  
The game remains rich in flavour, gripping in intensity and facinating in how some simple mechanics can feel like the second half of the 20th century unfolding before your eyes, even after 30-odd plays.

Absolutely worthy of the #1 ranking crown. The mechanics are perfectly in sync with the geopolitical bipolar super-power influence-struggle theme. I love the tug of war VP track.

The game gets better when you know what you're doing. The imbalance is less worrying. Eight games in and I've seen USA win twice. Both plays were against new players as USSR. I've yet to try the recommended balancing mechanism. For my 2nd edition it is 3 additional influence points for the US and allowing overspend (more influence in a country than needed for control).
---
After a two years' break I'm four plays in now. All games ended with a USSR win in midwar, still waiting for the first US win. Might be lack of experience but I'm wondering how this - at least perceived - imbalance has passed playtesting. Quite astonishing for the game ranked #1 on BGG. It also disturbs me that my 2007 edition now is outdated with the new rules and cards introduced by the deluxe version. Nonetheless, exploring the game system is intriguing and I'm up for the challenge to win with the US under the old ruleset.
---
Two games into it and definitely want to play it more. So much depth and diversity and yet easy-to-learn rules and complexity.

Uno de los mejores juegos que conozco para dos jugadores. Te mantiene en tensi√≥n toda la partida y te obliga a tomar decisiones dificil√≠simas continuamente.

FUNDAS: Enfundado con fundas est√°ndar (chinas). Cartas de tama√±o est√°ndar (sobra un poco de funda).

UPDATE: las cartas opcionales y los 2 puntos de inicio en Canada equilibran el juego en favor de USA. No me gusta la variante de la guerra civil china.

Overrated. US are very dificult to win. Actually, in 20 games US only won once. You are playing against the cards you draw and the strong USSR initial position. Always the same.

Really like this game but find it difficult to get friends to play. It takes a little long to play for what it is.

8 Feb 14 - Got this out again after a long hiatus. Really enjoyed it. Game length seems to have come down a little. The solo rules are great too. You wouldn't think it but the solo variant is actually quite tough. Putting this up a point because of the solo rules.

26 May 14 - Officially giving up on this game. So disappointing. My friend and I can only win when playing Russian. Stupid! Far too long. Takes 5+ hours to play. No way to mitigate bad dice rolling which really badly affects your game. America on back foot the whole way and then can't win. Ridiculous! Selling on ebay.

I've now played this one a lot, and I think it's the type of game that people will still be playing in 20 years.  The games can be incredibly tense, because the balance of power can shift quickly and dramatically. EDIT 7/28/07:  I now am experienced enough to know (via hard data) that the game favors the USSR at least 60/40.  Even knowing this, I still like it.  I think the US ought to be given 2 or 3 starting VPs for it to be fair.  EDIT 3/2/08:  Even realizing the inherent bias in the game, this is the shit.  I love this game.

The more I play this game, the better I like it.  While there definitely is some luck of the draw and dice, the game will generally go to the person with a better strategic plan.  Knowing the cards helps, so an experienced player has a big advantage over the n00b, and coming up to speed doesn't really take all that long.

After putting it off for way too long, we finally started playing this and it has me ravenous for more wargames, which I now realize can be fantastic, long and meaty 2 player experiences for the wife and I to dig into. I have also decided it is ok if they aren't perfectly balanced or have some luck (I don't have enough experience to judge the balance of TS though). They tell great stories and are fun to puzzle over and play as well as you can.

The gameplay is not complicated once you learn the rules, but there are a lot of exceptions to remember so it takes a couple games to really get the hang of it. Because of this, I give it a gameplay weight of 4 - medium/heavy. It's extremely fun for 2 players, but not a game you can just jump into and play in like an hour--there's a learning curve.

RATING: 6
Very interesting theme.  Plays a bit long for my tastes.  Also the mid and late game board can become quite full, which results in a game that requires a lot of concentration as you manage all your options, the various card interactions, and the scoring possibilities.  I definitely see the merits of this game, simply not my style.

Fantastic game. However, it is a too big of a game for me to always want to play it. I would have to plan ahead for a time to really get up for it.

While the rules themselves aren't really complex, it's just a lot to pay attention to. A well balanced game between two opponents will run for hours. It leaves my friends and I exhausted when it's done.

RATING: 9
As a non wargame player the presentation really makes a difference to me, and it just feels better to play with better components, especially the mounted board.  While it is not the most aesthetically pleasing design, it feels like the game has the type of components it deserves.

Though still nowhere near experienced as a player, I can appreciate the depth and strategy the game offers.  After having played some of Jason Matthews' other co-designed games I definitely feel like this is the strongest.  I like how the map in Twilight Struggle is highly important, whereas in 1960 it felt underused, as if the connections between locations were not as important.

The choices are always interesting, and I like how each round can present different frustrations.  It's so easy to think that your opponent is always getting the best cards but it never really seems to be the case, it comes down to what you're going to do with what you're dealt.  I also think the die rolls make sense thematically and feel right.

This was a pretty cool Cold War reenactment. The game plays smoothly, although there are quite a number of things to pay attention to. Sadly, the components are fiddly, and keeping track of controlled countries is a pain. I can see the AP kicking in the later stages of the game. There are so many countries to track, and you'll want to edge in right before a continent is scored.

Absolutely fascinating. Provokes a curiousity in the events the game makes use of to manipulate the world. The more you follow up on that curiousity and reasearch the historical events, the more you understand why the game works and behaves the way it does. The more you understand that, the more invested you become in the narrative that you create by altering such history. It makes learning fun for goodness sakes and you walk away feeling exhausted, but smarter by the end of it every time.

I would love to have this game! I read so many good things about it, but mainly because my whole upbringing took place in the Cold War.

Although it is a wargame and I have never played a wargame but for this theme I would give it a try.

RATING: 10
I haven‚Äôt played this game enough yet - for want of opponents, mainly. At the beginning of my learning curve my opponent could not easily find the 3 hours needed. We played on line but unfortunately the brilliant, first-class implementation we used (Chantry) was asked to cease and desist.

The rules are no more tedious to read than any other rule book and a great deal better than some. The game is relatively easy to learn, though in my experience the first couple of games were a bit of a getting-to-know-you struggle with the rules, concepts and tactics - and especially the cards - rather than a fluid game - though they were great fun anyway. In the first, my opponent accidentally triggered a nuclear war, and the dismay was palpable. In the second I realised that one of the cards in my hands would allow him to force me to trigger nuclear war, and that card then hampered me for several turns, and indeed, caused me to lose the game in the end. It turns out I'm not very good at this game. I think I've lost every game I've played.

The game is steeped in theme - this is the Cold War and its tensions on a board. Each player feels that his hand consists of events that only really benefit his opponent, and each player feels constantly tense as the cards fall. 

I know from reading around that many players have spent so much time with this game that they play a tight strategic game. In my case, it is still a matter of floundering from crisis to crisis, and having to delve into the rules from time to time to clarify what happens next. But it is probably my favourite game of all, and I include in that generalisation my many precious war games.

Though this fast, tense, well balanced, absorbing game is not a war game. This is a political struggle between superpowers. Wars are completely abstracted; coups and revolutions, influence and the avoidance of nuclear armageddon are the nerve and thrust of this game.

The balance in the game is interesting, since the cards tend to favour the USSR in the first half of the game, and the USA in the remainder, so balance is a little dynamic. But that adds to the flavour and tension of the game, and the asymmetry between the two sides adds to the game‚Äôs interest.

Much of the system has been stripped down from that of an earlier GMT game, Roads to Glory (another of my top few games) and it works really well in its new environment. Otherwise this game is unlike any other that I have encountered.

Simple, clever, engaging, satisfying, tense - what more could you ask for?

A good game, although the unbalance can turn some people off. I like it though. Maybe that's where they got the "Struggle" from to the title. But the unnecessary dice make the early game feel even more unbalanced for the Yanks. I prefer the "MotP" Support Checks over the dice. Even though it doesn't affect the randomness, it just FEELS better. Otherwise seems like a good game. Gots to play some more.

RATING: 6
The (sort of) bad: For one thing, Twilight Struggle punishes you for not playing it more often. My first time playing, I managed to wrest Japan from the grip of the U.S., not knowing that there was a card that would nullify my massive expenditure of OPs. Of course, the same thing happens to the U.S. from time to time, too, but it's usually via cards like Junta or Willy Brandt, which aren't as severe as Pope John Paul II or the Postwar Occupation card (or whatever it's called.) So there's a bit of a learning curve, and I'm not convinced that the game doesn't just go to whoever knows the wrinkles better.

I also have a big problem with cards like Wargame, which can nullify a LOT of careful planning, and Red Scare/Purge, which punishes your opponent by straitjacketing them for 1/10 of the game every time it comes up.

Also: "Chili?" "Replublic of China?" Really, GMT?!

The good: what a majestic simulation. The theme is strong, the Realignment, Space Race, Coup, and Influence mechanics allow for a wide range of strategies. There's a little luck involved, but over the course of the game (especially if you get rid of Red Scare/Purge and Wargame, as I would), the luck evens out over time. It was a real treat to play this for the first time and wince when my opponent dropped Missile Envy or managed to grab Iron Lady from my hand and play it - it's the best kind of pain (well, maybe not the BEST, but close.) The hand management is chaotic enough that it's anyone's guess at the beginning of a round how your own scoring cards and plans will interact with your opponent's, but there are still rewards to strong positional play. I will definitely buy this.

[EDIT: Now that I own it, I absolutely love this game. The gorgeous Deluxe edition fixes all the wonkinesses of the original game except for the unbalanced USSR problem, which is best fixed by variant. It's a fantastic game that does credit to the already swelling line of GMT classics. I can see playing regularly for the next few years. Well done, Matthews and Gupta.]

[EDIT II: With 10 plays under my belt (nevermind what my played games thingy says), I can say with certainty that this is a great game, but its unbalance is a serious issue that has to be addressed every time you play. Just 'cause GMT sent a game out into the world that needs to be fixed to be even remotely fair, no matter how elegant and well-made and atmospheric and interesting it is otherwise, I have to take this down a notch from 9.5 to 9.]

[EDIT III: a dozen games in, the cracks are really starting to show. Much as I'd like to think I usually win at this because I'm just damn good at it, which I am, there's a devil on my shoulder whispering that it's just because I usually make sure to play as the Sovs. Last two games, I've tried throwing an additional 3 influence to the Americans plus one in Saudi, and that hasn't helped. I'm not sure the balance issues are fixable. Down to an 8 now.]

Have played over 50 times in less than three months. A game with deep strategy. Some think it is dice-dependent, but that is because they do not know how to play this game. Had a game in which I roll only 1~2 and my opponent only 5~6, and still won the game with an auto-victory by scoring the right region in the right time. In another game I was screwed by dice, I won by dropping Defcon to 1 in his turn. In yet another game I grinded to turn 10 and won by a last action round Voice of America. This game requires you to know the deck very well to excel, but the beauty of it is that you will end up studying the cards by yourself after a few play -- because it is a great game that a gamer will want to master.
Play time: Some think it is too long because their first few games often take over 5 hours. But most of the games I play now only take an hour to two hours max. When you get used to the cards this game has virtually no downtime -- you are always watching the board and reacting to your opponent's move.

Not bad at all, but after having played it a few times, there is just not enough in the game to entertain me for the 3 hours or so that it takes to finish.

Well designed; good decisions.
Rulebook (deluxe edition) makes the rules seem more complex than they are.
After 3 plays, it seems that a bad hand and a DEFCON 3 going into a turn can sometimes cause an unavoidable instant loss by thermonuclear war.  That is very silly -- or annoying -- after lovingly pushing little influence markers around on all these little countries for 2 hours.

RATING: 5
At first I thought it was a fun game marred by overly-powerful and capricious scoring cards (and gave it a 7.5 rating here, I see). Then the more I thought about it, the more it came to annoy me. I'm more than willing to embrace the idea of a counterfactual game about a truly bipolar cold war where the domino theory worked, but my problem with this game is that that "cold war cartoon" premise is the basis for the mechanics but the cards are all based (often far too literally) on the events that happened in the real, not simplistically bipolar cold war where the domino theory did not work. So it ends up often mirroring actual history (and being praised by its fans for doing so) when if it really were a comic book version of the cold war it should not do so. In the end I can't help suspecting that the designers created the game not knowing that the cartoon cold war wasn't the real one, then when this was pointed out to them offered the "it's just a cartoon" argument as a post hoc, it's-not-a-bug-it's-a-feature rationalization.

what an amazing and elegant system. So many cool cards, and the game has only 8 pages of rules, and can be played in 1-3 hours. A simple, rich, and dynamic game. Game screams for an expansion deck! I would give this game a 10, except there are a few mechanics that I dont agree with, but since I have already bought a replacement deck for my cards, you can imagine that those few mechanics have not slowed down my play on bit!

Amazing experience! one of the best boardgames i have ever played! I didnt like the theme very much but it describes  the last 60 years modern history that we all know much or less. An excellent hand management mechanism plus some possible minor dice rolls and a lot of strategic decisions to make. Perfect!

When I first played this I didn't really "get" the game. Gradually as i have become more familiar with it I have come to enjoy it more and more. While i no longer have the thrill of discovery that you get when playing a game for the first couple of times, I do have the understanding of how this game unfolds. I am sure there are games other people will find interesting, enjoyable, and challenging in some ways. For me though, this offers all 3, and as a big plus, its confrontational. I love confrontation in a game, give me another player to beat on and I am quite happy.

Finally got to play, but we didn't finish.  The intial learning curve is a bit steep and it is easy to miss little rules here and there.  Very fun though, just wish I had more two player game time.

Update: Ok I've played 4 times and I'm basically done.  I have no interest in counting cards and mastering the art of chit/card valuation for this game.  This game was fired by Android Netrunner.

Update 11/2013:  Played again against the same opponent.  We almost finished (got to turn 9) before we had to stop.  I couldn't wait to play something else.

Review: We didn't rate this one since it's extremely intense and very cut-throat. Due to the very heavy amount of strategy involved and the very long length of the game, we haven't played it much. I (Keith) like strategy games and would probably review it highly. It's remarkably deep and seemingly balanced and delivers history while you play which is cool. You feel pretty epic when you're winning. Lindsay would give it a 6.

Very random area-influence game.  Can go to 2 to 3 hours if goes the full 10 turns (longer if with new players who have AP).  Usually ends earlier on an auto-victory for the Soviets, if the Soviet player is experienced.  

My rating has finally settled to a 2 for this game.  After the initial excitement due to the theme and how well it plays by email, the fact that the randomness of the dice and cards determine the outcome more often than the players' decisions makes this game one that I'd rather not play.

Wow, a two and a half hour card game.  I've seen so much hype about this game here on BGG and it's so highly rated that I couldn't help being interested.  

Then I found out that it's really just a very long card game.  The cards are supposed to add flavor and I guess they're cool if you're into the period, but this game was dry and lifeless for me.  

And getting screwed repeatedly by the cards just isn't good in a game of this length.

Of course, there is area control, as well, but here I felt the game is rudimentary to the point of being abstract.  It could be on the moon or in medieval spain.  The little counters with numbers don't really help.  Pretty much every country is equally influence-able, which is absurd and shows the evident lack of depth.  

At least other card driven area control games don't pretend to have historical significance or last this long.  Scratch that, El Grande does at least to some degree and it lasts over an hour.

Initially really enjoyed this game: it's a really well-made 2 player head-to-head. However, after a few plays...I can't understand the praise that there is little to no luck--I would argue there is a LOT of luck. From the control of a crucial region from events or whether I can coup a pivotal country or advance in the space race, it is entirely based on my rolling! There's been countless unlucky/lucky streaks myself and the opponent have experienced that would have had a great impact should something have succeeded/failed. Still, there's still something very immersive and enjoyable about the game, and the newest implementation is gorgeously produced. I just can't deny that I like it a little less with each play...

Scattershot historical events add a nice theme to this area-control game.  The best history in the game is the need to match an opponent's influence in otherwise neglected regions of the world.   +1 if you're old enough to know that "defect" is also a verb.  Three plays, waning interest.

RATING: 10
This is no Euro or wargame. Instead, it is a fast-playing, 2-player, power-politics game on the Cold War (1945-1991). 

Unfortunately, there appears to be a play balance problem in that the USSR often wins within 4-turns. For the US player to win, he needs to play for the long game unless he can get an autowin in Europe. 

Some of the 2nd edition cards have changed and it is too early to tell if the changes have balanced the game.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Most excellent 2 player struggle.  If I want to have the feel of a real war game in a playable time frame, this is a top choice.  The card play created constant tug of war since they come from a limited deck that contains half your cards and half your opponents.  Mitigating how you benefit your opponent is half the game (well maybe not if you are really good).

The side benefits of military actions/DEFCON and the Space Race provide interesting excursions and considerations.

CONS:  It's long? (though not so for a war game)  That's the only thing keeping it off the regular table.  Being a game based on real history, there are many timeline aspects that create exceptions to the rules, so learning the metagame (card interactions) is a must to play well.

I could see myself rating it a 9 , since I will be playing this for some time to come, but the time issue will keep it off the table.  Atleast it's easily finishable in a game session though, unlike typical war games.

I once rated this game a 10 because I enjoyed it that much and think it a wonderful design.  However even though the game is so fun its hard to find someone fun to play the game with.  They all either know the game way better than you ever will or just aren't interested in this kind of game.  So it's very chess-like in that regard because you need someone at your experience level.  Hard enough to find opponents and come to an agreement on games without that additional requirement.  I do have the Computer version now so perhaps that will allow me to gain enough experience such that this one complaint will become null and my rating will climb again.  I do really enjoy the way influence works in the game even if I am so very bad at it...

NOTE: I'm not really interested in the historical value of the cards in this game and that hasn't affected my enjoyment any so I think that's part of the success of this game as you don't have to be a History nut to see the beauty in the mechanics and the gameplay itself.

(Rating based on tens of plays)

The best game ever. It is based on direct interaction between two players, requires planning and strategic thinking. It contains random factor but the best thing is that the randomness can and must be mitigated by player actions. It's the same situation as with playing bridge - you get random cards and have to somehow manage the game with them.

The mechanics of the game is very simple. It is easy to explain but takes a lot of play to fully grasp the nuances. Despite simple mechanics Twilight Struggle has incredible feeling and recreates the tension of the Cold War in a great way.

It is overwhelmingly complex and fiddly to play this game as I am a beginner. In addition, I had no idea what I was aiming at during the play. I don't see why this is highly regarded but I believe that means I need to struggle more.

:star::star::star::star::star::star::star::star::star::nostar: (10 plays November 2017)
Each game gives me a huge pressure and stress. It is fight for live. I do sense the cleverness of this game that every piece of this game is intentionally well crafted. The actions and reactions of cards are truly amazing. I get this game little too seriously and intense and I guess that means the game is that good. However, it is little bit too tiring to play that often.

RATING: 8
I haven't played that much Twilight Struggle, certainly not enough to understand how to play it well. Like Caylus and Through the Ages, expertise with TS only comes after many, many plays. But for me, much like Labyrinth (which I have played many more times), the fun in TS comes from optimizing my turn. What to play as a headline is usually straightforward, but the rest of the choices are quite difficult. And add to that the fact that the events and the ops are all just the means to an end in a complex area control game, and the depth of this game is just staggering. Add to this the amazing quality of the board and cards and TS is simply a gem of a game. It is entirely deserving of its place at the top of BGG's rankings.

RATING: 10
Tense frustrating in a good way to the very end.

(November 2015)
A con could be how powerful some cards are, which means that for somebody not having a pretty good knowledge of the deck probably would waste unfortunate resources on something that anyway could fail the power of a single card. Even though dice mitigate some otherwise deterministic game play, it means that this game has to be played by:

- two who discovers the game together and hence both are victims to surprises, that might make the game even more fun
- two who have reached the same level of skill

Otherwise one player has to be very patient and willing to spend a whole lot of time teaching the game, probably holding back to not end the game not even reaching middle war.

Anyway, is this a con or not I don't know. Some abstract games with no element of luck don't forgive a single mistake.

I didn't expect to really like this one but bought it given the reputation here on BGG.

It turns out that it's really a great game! Normally, in my opinion, games with a lot of theme like doesn't work well because they tend to impose limit to the gameplay but this one doesn't have the problem. Another issue I feared is that the game would be too scripted if it did follow history but given how tight the design is, simply playing a card before the other changes everything. Finally, I also feared the randomness added with the dice would be problematic but in the end it doesn't really matter, it's how you play your hand that does.

The game takes a long time to play but doesn't feel too long since you have a constant stream of interesting decisions to take.

If you remember the cards (because you did play before) you already won, if you are new to game you will be beaten badly every time. It is not a game which can be played with new people. It is not a tactic or strategy that will let you win, is is just a remembering what is in opponent deck, what he used already and what he can have at hand.  It is like poker, but you don't know what cards are included in deck. Bought it cos of high wargame ratind (1st place), but i found it to lack and aspect of wargame. It is a card game set is war theme.
Update: After another try, I lower my rating to 2. Shame few counters is lost, I could sell it at least.

My wife and I have played this game repeatedly and enjoy the game a lot.  While not a war game in the more traditional sense of hex and counters, the tension and easy learning curve make it an enjoyable game for the non-wargamers.  I would give the game a ten simply if the game were packaged with a mounted game board instead of the stiffer "tag" board.

I can see why people like this game, but it has too much randomness for me.  Some games are simply unwinnable if the wrong cards come in horrible sequence.  When that happens the game is zero challenge to the winner, and an annoying exercise in frustration for the loser.  Interesting mechanic otherwise.

Excellent carddriven area-majority strategy wargame superbly dipped in the thematic sauce of the Cold War. Luck of the cards and dice combined with tactical and strategical choices. Slight advantage for the USSR in the early war, but the USA has better cards in mid and late war. Unvoluntarily triggering a nuclear war can be an anticlimax. Knowing the cards is a must for optimal play.

This is a fantastic war game. You have to really get into it in order to enjoy it. you also need to play it a few times (I'm 2 plays in).

Top-notch 2-player game. Does a wonderful job of capturing the tug-of-war and cat-and-mouse that was the cold war, matching mechanics to theme beautifully. While it caters more to history buffs and those who experienced it, this game is still good fun. Slightly long but the last 4-hour game blew by fast.

Flimsy 2nd Ed. board broke a panel off on me by the 4th play. :P gg GMT

#1 without any doubt. this game is absolutely flawless. the mechanics are simple yet enable hundreds of strategies and create incredible tension - which fits the theme perfectly. the only minor problem - it's a game to be taken seriously, definitely not for a lazy weekend evening. also - not suitable for players who dislike strong negative interaction - after all it's a game about people who wanted to eradicate each other with nuclear weapons and it captures that dynamic perfectly. requires some practice to show it's full potential.

Update May 24, 2013: As much as I want to not "along with the crowd," I really do think this is a great game.  I miss the ability to block the opponent's use of "their" cards when you use them like is available in 1960, but it does seem to balance out on both sides.

Why, why, why, why?!?!?  I will never understand the appeal of this game.  I have tried - multiple times.  I am so completely lost on why this is always hailed as the Citizen Kane of board games.  I love war games - both light war games and complex historical ones, so its not like this is outside my wheel house.  For starters, it is BORING - blah!  Second, the card play is so darn frustrating - on your turn you are essentially deciding what benefit you are going to give to your opponent.  It is rare that you will have a hand of cards that completely benefits you.  Teaching that to new players is such a grind.  Stay away, don't believe the hype!

A game with many many choices each turn and a ton of strategy.  I think I would have to play this a lot more to master how to play it well and enjoy it more.  It is not as thematic or visually appearing as many other themed games.  But then, the Cold War isn't the easiest to draw theme from.  You do feel like you are a leader of that time period, making difficult decisions.  Would probably be more appealing to someone who grew up in the Cold War era and is more familiar with all of these historic events.

Interesting theme but takes way too long (+6 hours) and placing political influence is not as much fun as moving around armies and battling. I also don't like how the cards you draw determine what you can do; it's a too easy way to recreate history and only detracts from the game mechanic. Imagine if you're playing chess and there's a card "your opponent's towers collaps" - that's how I feel about the card system here. Strongly dislike the scoring system, where you need an "Asia scoring card" to get points from your great position in Asia. Why introduce such randomness in a war game, which should be about strategy and units?

Really, there is every other game in the world, and then there is Twilight Struggle.  Nothing but Summoner Wars can compare.  The game is so wonderfully thematic, carefully balanced, historical, strategic, and just perfect in every way.  True, against a seasoned player the game will last a while, and true, it is a bit hard on new players.  However, the Late War variant that comes with the game allows for a better learning environment.

As with all GMT games, the components are very cheap and the board is more functional than beautiful.  Also, no thought is given to storage, and a GMT Storage Tray, while useful, makes it difficult to fit the components back into the box.  But the game is so wonderful that I am willing to overlook this!

The fact is, nothing is quite as satisfying as playing this game.  Win or lose, I always always always enjoy the experience.  I learn something new each time.  Probably only Summoner Wars can compare.

Deceivingly simple. It's not really a traditional CDG but more like an area majority Euro for two players with the historical flavor. No wonder the appeal is so widespread.

RATING: 8.85
I can definitely see why many think of Twilight Struggle as the best game ever but this game is not for me because I really don't like direct conflict, especially with my wife :P

+ Super thematic! Event powers and names are well connected.  
+ Real brain burner! I think the weight should be at least 4.0 because there are soooo many things to do and consider. Constant VP lead in the game doesn't mean that you are doing well in the long run. 

- Steep learning curve (some unintuitive base rules and a huge amount of cards that are often not very clear on the first reading)
- Takes a long time. People say 2-3 hours but it lasted about 9 for us. Though, it was our first time and we are always quite slow when it's only the two of us playing.
- Luck involved with dice rolls and card drawing. 
- Very hard to predict what your opponent is capable of if she blindly draws 8 new cards every round. It is exciting of course but it just gets annoying after a while.

Personally, I don't like direct conflict and unpredictability in games. If I wanted to play an intense area majority game, then I'd rather pick Dominant Species because it is less chaotic and can support more players.

Twilight Struggle inherits its fundamental systems from the card-driven classics We the People and Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage. It is a quick-playing, low-complexity game in that tradition. The game map is a world map of the period, whereon players move units and exert influence in attempts to gain allies and control for their superpower. As with GMT's other card-driven games, decision-making is a challenge; how to best use one's cards and units given consistently limited resources?

Twilight Struggle's Event cards add detail and flavor to the game. They cover a vast array of historical happenings, from the Arab-Israeli conflicts of 1948 and 1967, to Vietnam and the U.S. peace movement, to the Cuban Missile Crisis and other such incidents that brought the world to the brink of nuclear annihilation. Subsystems capture the prestige-laden Space Race as well as nuclear tensions, with the possibility of game-ending nuclear war.

A deluxe edition, published in 2009 includes the following changes from the basic game:

‚Ä¢ Mounted map with revised graphics
‚Ä¢ Two double-thick counter sheets with 260 counters
‚Ä¢ Deck of 110 event cards (increased from 103)
‚Ä¢ Revised rules and player aid cards
‚Ä¢ Revised at start setup and text change for card #98 Aldrich Ames

RATING: 10
[b]Twilight Struggle[/b] has sit on Board Game Geek's #1 ranking throne for quite a while and as such gained an almost legendary reputation that still makes people curious to find out why it is such a popular game. Like many other people, this is the way I discovered this game that is actually outside of my usual comfort zone of Ameritrash and a Eurogames, since [b]Twilight Struggle[/b] is wargame/area control game.

When I finally had the chance to learn the rules and played the game for the first time, I was not entirely sure how I would rank it in the end, because it is a game which demands repeated plays to unfold itself to the players, as knowing all the unique cards with their effects and also when they enter the game is key for developing a successful strategy.

The biggest surprise I had was finding out that this apparent masterpiece of a strategic game has a very intergrated use of random die rolls, and although I did like the game right from the beginning and immediately understood why it is so popular, this aspect left a bit of a bitter taste to me for a long time, as I was expecting way less randomness from such a high-ranking strategy game.

So yes, while this game is indeed a brilliant strategy game, it just so slightly misses the mark in my opinion for deserving to be calle a masterpiece of a game, as the random factors are indeed too prominent and often impactful. I am not exclusively referring to the rolling of dice (which happens quite frequently), but also the randomness of drawing cards, which can sometimes result not only in a frustrating game experience (if the player draws unlucky hands), but also in a premature ending of the game.

Having said all that, [b]Twilight Struggle[/b] deserves its accolades and won awards. It treats the subject matter in a respectful and historical way and manages to simulate the Cold War in an abstracted board game format in a fantastic way, including the inherent bluffing and mind games between players.

While the game is asymmetrical and has a real strategic depth, it's actually not that hard to learn and teach: the rulebook is 32 pages long, but the actual rules part is found on just the first 10, which are also well-written.

The biggest obstacle in learning the basic concepts and flow of the game is probably getting familiar with the somewhat "different" nature of it, especially for non-wargamers (like me). After that, the next challenge becomes mastering the game, because as mentioned before, knowing all the unique cards (that are this game's life blood and driving force) makes the difference between actually creating and following a strategy (also limiting some of the game's random card draws) and just playing from turn to turn in a strategy-wise incoherent way. As such, it is best to learn the game with someone of the same skill level, as a veteran will absolutely crush any newbie.

The production quality of this game (Deluxe Edition) is excellent. The rulebook alone is a highlight and one of the best I ever read: written in a clear an precise way, every new chapter is introduced with a fitting quote, every rule numbered for easy quick-referencing. The rulebook includes variants (including an option that allows players to start the game in the late stage), an extended example of play to provide a solid impression of the game's flow and also brief rundowns on all the historical events depicted on the cards -- just short enough for allowing curious and unaware players to quickly pick up the rulebook and get a quick summary what the card refers to. The counters are rounded (not an industry standard), the illustrations and colour scheme of the board and cards give the impression that the designer aimed for a fitting "dated" and minimalistic look.

It should be noted that while the game is thematic and attempts to simulate the Cold War, the designers made deliberate decisions in terms of theme and game design. Quote from the designers (found in the rulebook):

[i]"Also important for players to understand is that the game has a very definite point of view. Twilight Struggle basically accepts all of the internal logic of the Cold War as true‚Äîeven those parts of it that are demonstrably false. Therefore, the only relationships that matter in this game are those between a nation and the superpowers. The world provides a convenient chess board for US and Soviet ambitions, but all other nations are mere pawns (with perhaps the occasional bishop) in that game. Even China is abstracted down to a card that is passed between the two countries. Furthermore, not only does the domino theory work, it is a prerequisite for extending influence into a region. Historians would rightly dispute all of these assumptions, but in keeping with the design philosophy, we think they make a better game."[/i]

Furthermore, the game makes a very clear and important statement by defining one of the game's defeat conditions: the player who causes DEFCON 1 is considered to have provoked nuclear war and is declared the loser of the game.

Best game of all times ? No, not in my opinion, but I can see why others view it that way, as it is an indeed excellent and multi-layered game of strategy, simulation and history with a critical outlook on the dangerous nuclear poker game that the Cold War was.

[2007.Mar.18] Twilight Struggle is an interesting interpretation of the Cold War. This card-driven game (CDG) uses historical morsels to populate the three (3) different decks of game cards: Early-, Mid-, and Late-War cards. I was a little disappointed with the quality of GMT Games' game components. For the price, the game's component quality should have be significantly better. (The cardboard map requires the use of a plexiglas sheet to keep it flat, while the bland game chits are uninspired at best.) Additionally, I was a little taken aback by the amount of dice rolling used to resolve many parts of the game; this was a bit unexpected for a CDG originally released in 2005. Despite the component quality and dice resolution, however, the game is good and should be played by all serious gamers at least once. I look forward to my next foray back into the Cold War.

[2009.Mar.10] The luck-of-the-die mars this game's elegance. If the designers were to propose an alternate mechanism for adjudicating the die-based resolutions, then this game would be (in my humble opinion, of course) a very good game.

Played twice so far and still getting to know it.  Seems like a lot of fun and an excellent replacement to Axis and Allies, but I don't know enough about it to give a rating yet.

Played it a few more times (didn't put them up on the site, thought).  We enjoy it more every time we play it.  The US seems to have an advantage, especially in late game.  I'm giving it a nine for now simply because it's far and away our best "war" game.

This is an excellent game. 

The event effects really serve to drive home the Cold War theme. It really does feel like you are fighting the Cold War.

In a sense it's hard for me to look at this game objectively. As a student of history I identify with the theme so much. The effects of Events for me are just so much more than their mechanical resolution on the board. The history is just a wonderful aspect of the game.

Fortunately there is a wonderful game hidden beneath all this history too. For such a thematic game I just can't fathom anyone playing it who didn't have a basic grasp of the Cold War. I recommend anyone interested in this game to do a bit of reading on the topic, it will only serve to heighten the experience.

Truly rewarding game here. I've a feeling i'll rate this highly after a few more plays...

RATING: 5
The components are all cardboard, the colors a garish blue/red motif on plain white cards. There is no art in this game, only a map - a Mercator projection map which makes Russia and Canada look gigantic - and event cards featuring black & white stock photos from history. Many cards don't have even stock photos and instead just have a flat stock image (like clip art) of a flag, region, or seal (i.e. NATO emblem, or the Chinese flag).

I found the aesthetic to be surprisingly dull and lazy given the mythical #1 spot this game commands.

The theme runs deep in the game, and if you are a fan of the cold war, you will be pleased by how the game nails historical events through the card event system.

It's a typical Ameritrash game, with many thematic exception rules that you are likely to forget or screw up your first few plays. Very inelegant.

It also uses dice rolling as a principal game mechanic to determine outcomes of important actions. To further compound the RNG-factor, random card-draws are another principal game mechanic, which can lead to serious imbalance and snowballing early in the game.

Two evenly-matched players can easily have the game determined by RNG through bad card draws or bad dice rolls. For me, this level of RNG was torture. The stakes felt too high for the RNG to wholly determine outcomes with nothing you can do to mitigate bad luck.

De los mejores juegos que existen, y desde luego el mejor para 2 personas. Dir√© que nunca he visto partidas con tanta tensi√≥n y tantas alternativas, remontadas √©picas y derrotas brutales desde la primera carta. Se disfruta m√°s a cada partida. IMPRESCINDIBLE.

The game that really made me love wargaming... even if it isn't a wargame (but I think it is).  The cards really drive a great narrative, and they make it feel like you're reliving history.  I especially love how the order of historical events (or even whether they happen at all) can change, but it elegantly filters things such that they still happen at a reasonable time.

I fully understand why this game is ranked no. 1 on BGG. A great strategy game with a great thematic. Unfortunately I think it is not perfectly balanced, as the USSR player has a clear advantage at the beginning, and the US player does so from the middle of the game on. It is also a little luck-dependant, as the cards drawn and the dice throws are responsible for much of the player's success in the game.

As far as 2 players games go, this is amongst the bests when it comes to deep high scope games.  On the longish side and I'm really tired with the theme (war history), but very nice play, fun interaction and varied situation.  On the plus side, at least the theme is well developed and you actually learn something worthwhile (as opposed to other games which feed you obscure details about insignificant skirmishes.  I'm looking at you, Combat Commander.)  Get the deluxe board if you can!

I love this game, but it never gets played because it's only two player.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
I first want to say that there are very interesting and unique mechanics in this game. So I consider this game to be quite innovative, but I don't really think I would ever love this game and even enjoy playing in tournament.

The card mechanic is very interesting on one point of view, but on the other side it's a brain burner. Cards have multiple functions. Either you use the special ability, either you use the value for 3 different things, either you flush it for the space race(1 card) or either you do not use it(1 card). Which gives a total of 6 functions. That is a lot.

Now add that most value effects can be targeted anywhere on the map. Anywhere is a lot of place where you can do stuff when you play for the first time. So you get overwhelmed by the choices and you simply do not know where to go.

In most game, when you have multiple functions for each card, you can simply forget about the other functions you are not going to use. Here it's different, because if you play a card from an opposing nation for it's value, the special ability gets also played. So you cannot simply block the effect of the card from your mind, you must always consider all the special abilities of your hand which has the consequence of increasing the level of brain burning.
 
It's even more a problem when one of your turn, you get stuck with a hand mostly of opposing nation cards. Which means that all cards that will be played will have a negative impact on you. So you must consider both ability and value to play your cards. 

It also means that what ever is the hands of the players, all the events in the game should happen anyway. There is only 1 space race card and 1 un-played card that will not happen. So the history is dictated by the game, only the order of the events will change.

This means that YOU MUST KNOW ALL THE CARDS BY HEART in order to play effectively, else it almost impossible to win against an experienced player. Since each card has unique abilities, there are hundreds of cards and I have a very weak memory, I will never be able to remember what all the cards does.

Some actions during the game allows you to roll some dice, compare influence and remove tokens according to the results. Each action has a different way to compute the values and determine the results. I don't know it I was tired this day, but I found it very complicated to easily visualize the math behind. For example, how to find the best place to make a coup. So I ended being lost in the calculation, re-asked many times how it worked again and chose almost random locations to make my actions.

Another frustrating element is that some actions requires you to be adjacent to have you have, while other actions can be accomplished anywhere on the board. This is very confusing, and I often got stuck in a situation where I forgot adjacency, because most of the game consist influencing anybody anywhere on the world and not having a expansion or progression of your homeland territory. I would have personally clearly defined limits like event can occur anywhere, but the card select the location for you while using a card for it's value is always adjacent to something you have. 

Finally, the game is pretty long for what it is. We played almost half the game and it took from 1h to 1h30. We had to stop the game, but I already had enough of the game by that time.

So I don't think I will ever like this game because first, there is brain burning, second there is a lot of memorization to do, third it's a very long game for a not so fun experience and finally it is an historical game, so each game seems similar to each other. 

So it's really not the game for me.

A great card-driven game that renders the Cold War theme fabulously.  Lots of card-play angst and balance, with each side using various different powers and the cards are staggered into Three Eras.

I had avoided buying this game because I doubted that I would ever have an opponent to play against.  My wife surprised me for my birthday in 08 with a copy and a promise to play it.    I now understand the hype surrounding this game.  My early concern is the play imbalance as the USSR has a definite advantage. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
This has become a favorite although still a struggle to get to the table due to play length and two player limitation. Tension is thick in this one. I have come to really enjoy Card Driven games and this is quite a Cold War standoff simulation.

FIRST IMPRESSIONS:

My first GMT game that I have enjoyed.  Time required to play will likely be a detriment to seeing much play, but this is an excellent game for two.  There are times though that I felt the game was more about limiting opportunities for the opponent to "score" more so than playing to "win".  Second edition is purportedly better aesthetically and has correct spellings!  Tough decisions must be made consistently as you may have to play a particularly favorable event card for your opponent in order to use the operation points to maintain a standoff or get an edge somewhere else.  Battleground countries are important to gain influence in many cases - don't forget about them!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a wonderful implementation of a card driven mechanic similar to Hannibal: Rome vs Carthage. But where TS really shines is how it manages to create the atmosphere and ongoing tension of the Cold War. Everything seems to be well designed and in its appropriate space in this game. Even the graphics have that pre 90's touch to it. The only reason I do not rate it higher is that I haven't played it that often and will have to see how it stands up to time.

This one is just too much for me to enjoy I guess. I enjoyed 1960: The Making of the President, which is very similar, but the complexity is toned down a few notches. I guess I just don't enjoy games that are this complex. It's one of the reasons I really never got into war games. It is also a little fiddly, and I think the influence marking in 1960 is handled better, with less book keeping.

RATING: 9.5
I am incredibly impressed with this game.  Excellent combination of historical feel and playability -- maybe the best I've seen in this regard.  Like the Cold War itself it is not a war in any conventional sense but rather a unique strategic undertaking.  This takes its place at the top of its class (along with We the People and Hannibal) for me.

It's important to see how this game handles the victory conditions for both sides. As a child growing up in the Cold War, this game could really recreate the same atmosphere of the 80's that we all experienced with.  It is not strictly a wargame per se though. Tapping on the card-driven games market, the cards are divided into early, mid and late war eras, similar to that in Thirty Years War.  Lousy box cover, one of the worst in recent GMT games.  The game pretty much favors the Soviet in the early turns.  So beware to hold out if you play the Allied. Taking the U.S. side should be the one more experienced. I have raised the balance issue before in the game's forum but soon enough many people would say it is otherwise. I still think it is more challenging and, perhaps, more fun to play the U.S. because you have to play a more subtle strategy than the Soviet in the early period. 

A highly recommended piece to read "Let a Thousand Variants Bloom" by Jason Matthews for his Twilight Struggle variant. 4 pages of background to his China Space card from C3i issue #21. The article is to give a view as to why the Soviet was delayed to own the China card in the game opening (3 influence points should be placed by the Soviets before they can claim the China card). The article is excellent to give the background to the Chinese Civil War both before and after the Japanese invasion during WWII. The role of the U.S. in the China theatre is examined in fair details. A perfect companion reading to this game I believe.

After a test play of 1 round: I really liked how the theme is blended in the mechanics.  The turns went very fast.  Jane got bored when I tried my many realignment rolls, though.

Still wondering how deep/challenging the game is, which is a very important criterion for us.

What I like:
- Lots of varied events.
- Lots of theme.  I remember fondly this situation where I created a "false" urgency: I knew that the Mideast scoring card was somewhere in the deck, so I invested in the Middle East; my opponent though that I did have the scoring card, so he then started to get influence there; I then saw this as a proof that he had the Mideast scoring card!  Thus, my paranoia completely created a situation where what mattered was completely unfounded (investing in the Mideast) despite being seemingly "proven" by the course of events.
- The constant tension brought about by the scoring cards and the final scoring.
- The need to pay attention to what the opponent is doing, so as to guess whether we're going to be scoring or not in some regions.
- I like the feeling of progression, with more and more countries being influenced by one of the superpowers.
- I really look forward to a 2nd game: I already enjoyed getting back some cards; they were like old friends.  The 2nd game should be faster, and more fluid, thanks to our experience with a 1st game.  Knowing the game better also means knowing the political situation better, and enjoying the game more (next time, I will know that the OPEC can be created, and I may try to prepare for it, for instance).

What I don't care for:
- Finding the historical details about a card, in the rule book, is somewhat hard.  I wish they had numbered the card, in the rule book, or ordered them alphabetically.
- The score fluctuates around 0: this does not give a sense of achievement, or of progress.  However, the situation on the board evolves, and it too is important, beyond instantaneous VPs.
- The first game was more of a learning game, because I had missed 3 important points.

Rules:
- The rulebook is great: very clear, and precise.  Not perfect, but close (for instance, the rule for shuffling the various decks into the draw pile are strangely under "4.5.H. Advance the Turn Marker"; the second part of 4.5.H is also a repeat of 4.4).
- I missed a few important rule points, which kind of forced the first full game to only be a learning game, and not a competitive one.
- After a single game, I think I won't have much problem remembering the rules, or knowing where in the rulebook to find them.

RATING: 10
A very good game about cold war. You won't notice the passing of time while playing this. Not a perfect ten because of the time it takes to play and spreading the influence is a bit abstract. You really have to balance between spreading influence, space racing and playing events. The more you play it, the more the secrets of the game unlock in your brain.

Again another game with a lot of potential. The quality of the board is substandard - thin and unwilling to lay flat, although the rest of the components are fine. That aside this game is incredibly evocative and the theme really sucks you into the historical battles that took place and all of the power plays and countries involved in this game of chess with global consequences. The game plays out slowly and steadily with you trying to average out gains and losses over several rounds and win the "long game". Highly rated and would love to play more in order to develop some strategies. Oh and it's educational too. My 10 year old took it into school as they were learning about the cold war and we both developed a slimmed down (30-45 minute) version of the game!

How does the exciting time from after WWII, until the fall of the Wall, in 1989? Play it all!

Twilight Struggle is a two-player game simulating the forty-five year dance of intrigue, prestige, and occasional flares or warfare between the Soviet Union and the United States. The entire world is the stage on which the two worlds are fighting for their own ideologies and ways of life. The game starts amidst the ruins of Europe as the two new superpowers scramble over the wreckage of the Second World War, and ends in 1989, when only the United States remained standing.

Component changes:
Mounted Map (the graphics have been re-done, and the map is now fully mounted instead of cardboard.)
Card deck or 110 cards (an increase of 6 cards)
Two counter sheets (Older editions had one sheet, there is no increase in the number of counters, but they will be rounded with corners)

Lutte Twilight est un jeu de strat√©gie pour 2 personnes terroriaal recr√©ant le temps apr√®s la 2√®me guerre mondiale dans laquelle les Etats-Unis et l'URSS s'Envelopp√© dans une ¬´ guerre froide ¬ª, qui, comme son nom l'indique se passe ¬´ sous la table ¬ª. Le jeu se d√©roule en trois grandes parties, qui repr√©sentent la p√©riode au cours de laquelle les diff√©rents dirigeants √©taient en charge et ont fait leur marque √† temps. De Staline √† Kennedy √† Reagan et Gorbatchev. J'ai d'abord achet√© ce jeu parce que je pense que vous devriez avoir le num√©ro 1 sur la liste Boardgamegeek en tant que fan de jeux. En plus, √ßa a l'air g√©nial. Jeu maintenant jou√© deux fois. Le livre de r√®gles regarde d'abord terrible d'√©paisseur, mais qui est qu'apparent: 15% du livre est vraiment le reste des r√®gles de contenu, un exemple d√©taill√© jouer beaucoup de charabia √† quel point les d√©veloppeurs et beaucoup explication tr√®s historique les cartes et la guerre froide. C'est un jeu merveilleux √† voir et les composants sont de grande qualit√©. Les cartes sont bien illustr√©es et le texte est clair √† lire et √† comprendre; mais un certain niveau d'anglais est requis. Il ne convient pas aux enfants trop jeunes, pour qui le th√®me est trop lourd et la compr√©hension de l'anglais trop exigeante. En fait, le jeu est tr√®s facile, il suffit de se souvenir de choses vraiment importantes, telles que les actions possibles et la signification des embl√®mes sur les cartes. La chose difficile dans le jeu est de r√©aliser dans quelle phase il est important d'agir o√π. Voici le complexe et le brillant du jeu. Cette perspicacit√© strat√©gique est vraiment n√©cessaire pour pouvoir gagner, et vous ne l'obtenez que lorsque vous l'avez jou√© plusieurs fois. Tout comme dans la guerre actuelle, l'attention de l'Europe s'est lentement d√©plac√©e vers l'Am√©rique du Sud et l'Afrique dans les premi√®res ann√©es. En fin de compte, l'int√©r√™t pour l'Europe a presque chut√© √† z√©ro. En outre, certaines cartes donnent vraiment l'impression qu'il se passe quelque chose d'historique, comme la carte de l'OTAN ou le pape Jean-Paul II, qui modifient consid√©rablement les chances des √âtats-Unis. Un inconv√©nient est peut-√™tre le temps d'√™tre dans le premier match (3-4 heures permettre), mais avec une torsion spontan√©e ou un mauvais choix au mauvais moment, il peut √™tre tout √† coup sur! Certainement recommand√© pour les fans de jeux strat√©giques.

Juego hist√≥rico donde aprender vicisitudes de esa √©poca tan convulsa y agitada de la 2¬∫ mitad del siglo XX que fue la guerra fr√≠a EEUU-URSS mientras se juega  un cara a cara entre superpotencias enemigas; un juego tan largo como apasionante que combina el azar de cartas y dados con la ma√±a y habilidad por parte del jugador para sacar partido de las posiciones ventajosas as√≠ como salir airoso de las situaciones inc√≥modas y adversas: he aqu√≠ la grandeza estrat√©gica del juego, el poner a prueba la capacidad de reacci√≥n del jugador en cualquier tesitura en una carrera de fondo por la hegemon√≠a del planeta.
Pese a su larga duraci√≥n (180 minutos aprox) el sistema de juego, una vez se domina, es r√°pido y din√°mico.  No es uno de esos juegos que puedan jugarse en un rato libre de ocio, sino que hay que guaradarle "cita previa",d√≠a D y hora H, ya que ser el pa√≠s dominante en la faz de la Tierra requiere su tiempo.

Still my favorite strategic/wargame, and pretty close to the best game I've ever played.  The depth of it is just tremendous, and there are so many layers of play that fit together so perfectly that it's stunning.  It rewards close play and attention, and while there's a limited number of variables, it never plays the same way twice.  

The design is pretty simple, but the depth of the theme is staggering, and actually having a chance to replay these old Cold War rivalries and rewrite history in a different order is thrilling.  It's hugely strategic, and it's got a pretty vicious learning curve, but once mastered, it's so rewarding.

How this game evolved for me...

[12 Jan 2008] Absolutely outstanding. Probably the most tense two-player wargame I've played in years. Might possibly improve to a 10. 
[8 Sep 2008] Moved it from 9.5 to 10. I get cravings for this game. It keeps me up at night after getting a play in, thinking "if only I'd tried a coup before..." Tension.
[14 Nov 2008] Ok, for me, this game goes to 11. 
[28 Nov 2008] Ok, I'm now hooked on playing this at http://www.wargameroom.com - and I've had crushing defeats, miraculous comebacks, and more.

Although it's not actually that complicated a game, there are a few little rules that you have to remember.  Plus the sheer length of the game can be intimidating.  [thing=27708]1960[/thing] is certainly more approachable---the components are nicer, the cards have better flavor text, and it feels like you have more control over the cardplay via the momentum mechanism.  You trade that for much more tension and angst in [thing=12333][/thing]---there's no more momentum mechanism involved that you can use to block your opponent's events, so if you have an event that benefits your opponent, you're out of luck.  You can't just toss it, so now it's a much more difficult decision to decide when to use it.  The map and area control also makes more sense than [thing=27708]1960[/thing], since neighboring countries affect each other, unlike the states in [thing=27708]1960[/thing].  Since there are three decks of cards in [thing=12333][/thing], there also feels like more of a narrative as the game goes by.  As a result, it appears to be a game that would just get better as you start becoming more familiar with the cards.

I would certainly recommend new gamers try out [thing=27708][/thing] before attempting [thing=12333][/thing].  Luckily my wife now tolerates it and I'm hopeful to get more plays in, but the time involved can be prohibitive...

I like the game less the more i play it, unfortunally the components are what we come to expect from GMT, pretty poor! This game give you the best feeling of the cold war tension that i've played. however i feel that the game could end too sudden by certain cards, although rare.

(based on original version. I have since traded up to the DeLuxe version)

Played it a couple of times, went and looked at a strategy guide, and found I need to change my focus (playing own events for OPS more, and let my opponent do the dirty work of implementing the events for me!)
I can't wait to give it some more play time!

My first impression of the materials is W0W! Good sturdy box, nice finish on the cards, and a sturdy board (would have liked it to have been mounted, though) Counters are the usual nice GMT fare - Rules seem easy enough to get through, but I have had to reread a couple of them *very* closely to extract the meaning from them.

Also: My box is now signed by Jason Matthews!

RATING: 8
UPDATE2: Having now played 6-7 times adjusted the rating due to two blowouts due to the Early War score cards coming to the same player turn by turn. Maybe history could have unfolded that way but its no fun being on either end of a blowout.

UPDATE: Raised rating - 3rd game played very different from 1st 2 outings. Realignments played a large role this time - was beginning to think it was a orphan action.

Components: About standard GMT fare. Use markers to show control.

Gameplay: Excellent. Since I have lived through about 95% of the events portrayed it "connects". Hand management is everything - it is very satisfying when you are stuck with a slew of your opponents cards and come out with minimal damage to your situation.

The split of Early, Mid and Late War decks and their intermixing makes for some unusal history to develop.

I haven't played enough to see all the cards in play but have been on the giving & receiving end of Wargames which might be a bit overpowered (you yield 6 VPs and game ends) Other player should have one shot at playing a card to adjust the score IMHO.

Of the actions: Realingment, Coup or Placing Influence - have seen little use of Realingment. Maybe that is situational dependent or due to relatively inexperienced players. Given my dismal performance on Coup attempts last game, maybe Realigns are a better choice...

A grand duel between 2 players that captures the the tension and crisis management that characterized the relationship between Cold War super powers. Players enact their own version of the Cold War by spreading influence and compromising their opponents through events drawn from history while always under the looming cloud of nuclear war. A long game that often takes the whole night, this game is definitely epic even for its scale.

Low confidence rating/first impressions.

While I don't consider this the #1 game in BGG's database, I can see why it is ranked as such. It gives a very historical simulation of the Cold War with a stressful yet intriguing hand management that sometimes forces you to play cards that actually benefit your opponent more. Also, while being not a history buff the different regions were a bit abstracted and samey for me, there was still constant tension of I must react and ursurp all plans of my opponents to get ahead in e.g. Vietnam or the space race. This therefore made the game have a feel of escalating conflict and zero-sum game that fits in with the Cold War theme well.

It seems like to play this game optimally you have to do quite a bit of metagaming, as there are cards that target very specific regions on the board. Each card is unique; however, since you play a large sum of your cards for their operations value rather than their effect they don't add as much variation as I would have thought. Also more cards means more unique cards rule ambiguities.

In regards to my comment that the regions felt abstract and samey, I'm not saying there isn't differences from country to country. The use of stability as both to determine a country's resistance to coups and also how much influence it takes for you to take over a country is pretty neat, and the values seemed to correspond to actual historical stability. There's also some neat area control bonuses for controlling countries close to ones that you already control, and some regions are considered battlegrounds which make them have different attributes from others. However, it felt like a ton of tiny skirmishes rather than highlighting the major wars within the Cold War. Perhaps since the 2 superpowers didn't really care about individual countries that is kind of the point.

Timing of when you play certain cards can be very important, as you test the waters of what cards your opponent potentially has for the rest of the round. At the same time you need to consider what cards are left in the deck and better your board position for the future too.

More than any other game I've played so far, I had no idea what I was doing and hence the low confidence in my rating. I do know though that game definitely has multiple layers of strategy/tactics that I have barely scratched the surface of and that is not one I should play when I want to relax.

The tenseness of this game is remarkable. As a student of history, and particularly Western history since the 1500s, this game is fantastic in highlighting some of the most important moments from 1945-1991. An absolute masterpiece of the Card Driven Game (CDG) system.

Somewhere between a 9 and a 7 so far. It is a very good game so at least a 7 purely based on the amazing design. However, I also find it frustrating as your whole turn is sometimes messed up due to some card your opponent plays. Once I decide whether it's tense or frustrating, I'll give a final verdict.

There's certainly a lot to like about this game. The components (while a bit austere) are of first rate quality and durability. The rulebook is magnificent - uniformly clear, incredibly succinct, gorgeously laid-out, and full of neat extra historical information. It's possibly the best of its kind I've ever seen.

Nonetheless, I'm a  bit perplexed at how this game got ranked so high. The best contemporary games, IMHO, succeed because they manage to capture the feel of some activity (farming, say, or maybe settling Puerto Rico, heh) while at the same time abstracting enough away from that activity to ensure balance, ease of play and the possibility of long-range strategy and tactics. The designers of TWILIGHT STRUGGLE have been so determined to gamify absolutely every major world event from the Cold War era that they've made these other goals virtually impossible to achieve for themselves. 

All things considered, they come admirably close, but in the game I played after eight intense rounds of back-and-forth, my Soviets suddenly jumped out to an insurmountable lead because I got dealt two cards in the same hand that I played in succession with no opportunity for my opponent to retaliate. Something like this would never, ever happen in AGRICOLA.

Great game! Alot of rich history on the Cold War that happened over a 45 year period right after WWII. I like the back an forth of the victory point struggle along with trying to figure out what your opponent is trying to do. I also like the cards that make you make tough decisions that can have ripple effects that are exciting or give your opponent an edge but also give you the reward. Basically what is worth more for your decision or plan? Is it the op points or the event?  
An absolute must have for strategy and history fans. Will be keeping this game for a long time if not forever.

july 23 2014: A 7 based on just 2 plays. 

This game is very hard to learn. The rulebook is long and quite complex, but the hardest thing is that, as a newbie, you simply cannot grasp how to build a sound strategy. It will require some more plays before I can feel confident in my choices

On the other hand, when the board is out, and you're sitting with the future of USSR or USA in your hands, the feeling is just epic. I have never played any other game that felt so grand.

Updated to an 8 after a handful more plays. You can get screwed by the dice, and you will be crushed by more experienced players. But this game is the fucking business

What a game!  This game will keep you on the edge of your seat until it's over--both players feel like they are losing and struggling just to stay in the game.  The time spent playing flies by.  I bought Twilight Struggle at a friendly local game store while out of town and opened it up right there, read the rules and played it twice with a friend (incorrectly, of course, but it was still great fun).  Great mesh of theme and mechanics.  Worthy of repeated play.  The rules in the box need corrections and are fiddly on a few points, but there is a set of FAQ that pretty well clears it all up.  So, why haven't you played it yet?Congrats on the Golden Geeks and other awards!

Played through example game solo. Variety of decisions each with a real affect and interesting strategy. Feels a bit like chess but with every piece having far more options. Look like you need to know what each card can do for each player in order to play this well and make good decisions.

The mechanism is simple and elegant but the depth of all the decisions. May be too heavy for me

I feel like this could be a great game if I played it enough to really understand all the cards, their longer term strategies, how to integrate them all, etc.. Unfortunately I don't play enough to know all those things and thus it feels very tactical for what should be a cold war long term strategy re-enactment.

Still I love historical games and really enjoy the flavor text. It is a game where you need to have players of equal skill level or it can be no fun quickly.

Highly engaging 2 or 3 hour romp through Cold War foreign policy.  3-tiered deck allows for relative historical accuracy and enjoyable card interactions.  Nice, usable components on clean board.  Wonderful balance of strategy, tactics, and luck.  Very rarely will dice determine the result of this game, but they definitely have an impact on strategy.  Same can be said of card draws and their tactical impact, IF both players are experienced enough to be able to use cards to their advantage or minimal detriment.  Definite learning curve, although individual mechanic rulesets are simple enough to present and understand (after one lengthy learning game, folks should have no difficulty playing again in the near future).  Theme is integral and perfectly presented.  Only deterrent to playing is relatively lengthy playtime.

Elements of randomness can be diffused by sound strategy, making this one of the most skill-intensive games I've ever played. As an added bonus I'm learning more and more about the time period and the Cold War.

After 1 play (sort of) I'm rating it an 8.  I can understand why this such a popular game.  Not insanely difficult to learn but it does have a lot of moving parts.  Once you figure out the mechanics it all boils down to area control strategy and smart card play.  A good game I definitely want to get on the table again.

Aug 2017 - used

First play Oct 23, 2017 - live as Russia, lost badly. Subsequently played on the app as Russia about 8 times over the next day and a half. Got a sense of how to play and even managed to beat the AI a few times. I can totally see why this game had been ranked #1 for so long, unseated only by lesser games that have greater mass appeal. That being said, despite my growing up during the cold war, the theme is not one that excites me so while I like the game and enjoy playing it, I don't think I will ever rate it as highly as it probably deserves, but I don't think it will ever drop in my estimation, either. Solid 8 for me.

Outstanding game with great reviews. But at 3 hours, I doubt this would get played more than once or twice. Risk is about the most that my students can handle for a 3 hour gamefest with 1 game. Not a game that has much appeal for my students.

It seems that 1960 scratches the same itch that this game does. But does so in less time and with more fun. See: http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/278441/twilight-struggle-vs-1960-the-making-of-the-presi

Actual Playtime Poll: http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/512910/poll-the-real-play-time
NB: There's no question that it takes at least 3 hours (sometimes longer, i.e., 4-5 hours) for first time players and maybe 2.5 hours for seasoned players. These are only average numbers, but still reflect the length of the game. THEREFORE, The big question then becomes whether the game feels boring (i.e., repetitive, etc).


NB: Checkout this DIY option since it would be a good use for our extra A&A board: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/image/533059/twilight-struggle

Many have said the game is complex. Others adore it. Here's a teaching site: Twilightstrategy.com if you want to learn to play.

4/2008 It's nice to finaly have played what everyone's talking at the moment.  It's a good game with many well integrated elements.  What brings it down is all the randomness.  To succeed you need luck to be on your side when drawing cards and throwing the dice.  Thus, each round you have to evaluate your new set of cards and then respond to your opponents actions, making long term planning difficult.  Although the cards might be balanced, a couple of (un)lucky rounds can make or break your game.  As for game length, for a game with so much luck involved it takes way too long.  Initial rating based on one game is likely to change after another game.

3/2010 Further game play has revealed several interesting elements and great depth, though the game type and topic seems to target a limited audience.  Rating up from 6 to a doubious 8 given several pre-requisites are fulfiled.

1/2011 Although war themed games are normaly not to my liking, this game has become the exception.  Rating up to 10, my "favourite" war game.

A deep game with surprisingly simple rules. Easy to learn, tougher to conquer, lots of fun to play. I find that having to work from the cards in my hand limits my tendency for AP, but there are still lots of tense decisions when you need that event but you also need the points but you don't want to give your opponent the bonus but you need to have control of South America so you can score it... The cards are awesome and the events really help to make the game for a history buff like me. I expect this to move up in my ratings if only I can find more people to play it with!

Clever made card driven area control game with great historical theme!!! Lots of background information about the Cold War. Great work! First few games take easily over 4 hours. It takes a while till you have an overview of all cards and can optimize your gameplay. A card overview comes with the game. The USSR is stronger at the beginning, the US is better in late war. Negative: Board is not standard Eurogame quality.

I had disregarded this game for a long time due to the fact that it only accommodates two players, but I'm very impressed after playing my first full game. Agonising decisions galore, an abundance of cunning strategies at your disposal, this game is HEAVY in the best possible way. Our game took ages to play, and ended in a hugely dramatic tie... to some a tie might sound like a poor/null result having invested countless hours, but it was anything but. The only game I have given an instant 10 and I can't wait to play again.

Update: the following two games have been disappointing in terms of enjoyment. The first of these was a heavy defeat which I deserved due to bad decisions and ignorance of important cards - I can live with this, as I will improve with experience and avoid the same mistakes. The second, however, was an enjoyable and very even battle for the first 6 or so turns, before being completely bent out of shape by monumentally one-sided dice results. It was just so dispiriting to see a great deal of thought and astute planning completely undone in the final turns by lucky roll after lucky roll for my opponent (almost every coup, even longshots, seemed to yield a 6 or a 5) and dismal roll after dismal roll for my part. I have read words to the effect that it is 'exceptionally rare' for luck to determine the outcome, but this was surely one of those occasions. Perhaps you just have to accept there is potentially a large amount of luck on offer if things don't happen to even out, but I feel the need to take a point off my previous assessment of a '10'. Galling, and can't imagine wanting to play again for a while.

RATING: 10

Very, very good.  Theme and atmosphere, and loads of tension - could easily give you a mad fit worthy of Kruschev.  Quite a lot of luck, I think, but it seems to make the game better, not worse. The design is original and brilliant in too many ways to detail here.

Few games' mechanisms give life to their subject like this one's do (here the feel of trying to control the entire precarious globe) with the card names and graphics providing the historical chrome that's the icing on a tasty, tasty theme-cake.

Also - all games played out very differently.  That's good.

The game mechanics are excellent and very enjoyable, deserving a much higher rating than 4, they probably deserve at least an 8.  The reason for the score being currently only a 6 is the length of the game (the first time I played the boardgame version it took 6 hours) and the fact that due to its length it's unlikely to see the table often.  I look forward to seeing if by playing the online version I can reduce the playtime of this excellent game.

Really a good game that takes the very essence of the cold war into a game, that you feel you drive those events by yourself! great game desing to make something asymetric into a overall balance (but i feel URSS have a little hands up) i love that you control countries by influence and the dynamic of the cards that makes you activate most of them (if not all) at certain point of the game. Saddly is a two players game.

One of the two best games I ever played. What can I say more? ;-)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
[Played 8 times]
It's not a wargame, but a fiddly area-majority game driven by cards and resolved with dice.
Probably more appealing to wargamers or those not minding if, after 3 hours, the outcome will be determined by a die roll in the last action of the last turn (happened thrice to us).

Theme is original and interesting, but gameplay is very random. You roll dice to: realign, coup, the space race, several events (all the Wars, Quagmire/BearTrap, Summit, Olympics...); that's pretty much everything you can do in the game except for placing influence.
Distribution of cards can screw you (because you get cards of low value or the opponent gets those with high value or you get only those associated with his events or all these together!) or help you a lot (reverse the examples).
Handling the events of the opponents would be the most interesting part, if it weren't often pretty obvious (play last those with effects "until end of turn", use the Space Race, the ONU and the "held option" to neutralize the most dangerous, etc.).
After you know the cards, you'll start to play around them (knowing that Cuba will be taken by Fidel, etc.).
The overall result is that you don't feel rewarded by your decisions, but driven to a random outcome by the dice and cards.

There are some production issues: 
-) you'll need something to replace control markers (e.g. wooden cubes) as they are overlapped and thus cannot be read (alternatively you'll need to inspect stacks of counters every few actions); 
-) it's quite uncomfortable to determine the degree of control you've in each region (and since this is crucial to scoring, you'll need to do it often);
-) some cards aren't clear enough;
-) errata corrige issued about cards and setup (and constantly evolving...);
-) some spelling errors.

Average game length for us: 3 hours.
Expensive.

Deep yet not overly complicated. An elegant and theme-drenched game if I've ever played one. Though it's not hard to get started, it's like chess in that there is clearly do much more to it than you first see in terms of possible strategies, and that you find yourself playing to beat the opponent more often than the game. Simply amazing

Best (and still intuitive) translation of historical events into a game. Love the fact that you start in Europe and slowly branch out all over the world (you get to experience the game mechanics before you have to deal with other continents). Clean mechanics (not like e.g. Hannibal, where too many mechanics are mixed), LONG game, but enjoyed the experience.

Played as US once and USSR twice... got smoked all three times.

UPDATE: Won as USSR, now have to beat "The Bear" next game.  Last victory points earned playing Middle East Scoring (for the second time) in turn 5.

UPDATE: Won as US, albeit against a less experienced player.  Auto-victory in turn 9;  last points earned with 4 Space Race points.

GAME 6:  Third win in a row, made a big push as the USSR in Europe, and was rewarded by the Europe scoring card coming up for the third time (and ending the game) in Turn 7.

Game 8 - Control of Europe in Turn 3 as US player!

Game 9 - My longest game so far... went 9 rounds.  I played several events that gave me Poland, then played Chernobyl and locked the USSR player out of Europe.  He had the Europe scoring card, and was forced to play it when I had domination, which led to an auto-victory.

Game 10 and 11 Online... losses

Game 12 - Conquered by Bruce the Bear in Round 7 (concession)

Game 13 - Warm-up for WBC

Game 14 and 15 - Wins (in WBC tourmey) as US and USSR respectively.  I was dealt good hands in both games, and had some very lucky die rolls in Game 15.  I didn't anticipate winning any games, so I had to forfeit in the round of 16, as I needed to return home.

Games 16-18 - Online. Quickly erased any hubris from WBC - I was demolished all three times, and I was getting pretty good hands in all the games.

Game 19 Back to F2F.  We simulated tourney bidding, and I got the US with 4(!) extra influence to place.  I just think that's too much of an advantage.  I was leading in VP's the entire game except for one action round in turn one, after my opponent played Olympic Games.
Autovictory in Turn 8.  Thanks for having me over, Alan!

Game 20 - Another game with Alan.  I got the US with 3 extra OPS from the bid.  My strategy was to blow out Asia, which I locked down except for N. Korea.  I also had an advantage in Europe because of my extra ops.  I changed course, however, and decided to not battle Alan's advances into Asia.  I'd already made my 8VP's from SE Asia scoring, so as he challenge in Asia, I turned an eye toward keeping either Saudi Arabia or Libya in the Middle East to prevent control, as well as getting started in the third world.  This was where the game was won.  Alan was never able to get an OP into South America, after an unlucky die role on a realignment wiped out his placed OPS after a Junta.  I also had the Panama Canal countries controlled.  It was too much for him to overcome.  I won an auto victory in either Turn 7 or 8.

Game 21:  An epic battle with Alan.  Alan took USSR for a 2OPs bid.  Die rolls for his space race were, as usual, terrible.  But I didn't dump too many cards there either, and I only ended up with a 4 VP edge there.  The scoring cards came in bunches, and both of us made some sub-optimal plays, missing out on points.  He was able to 5-Year Plan to throw away South American Scoring, which I'd set up for 9VP's by realigning him out every time he dipped his toe in 'The Pond'.  This hurt, but I was able to hold my lead in Europe throughout the game, and this paid off a couple VP's each time Europe scoring arose.  I had a great setup in the Middle East, but Muslim Revolution hurt me badly.  As luck had it, Alan's hot coup rolls went cold in the Late War, and I was able to stay strong in Asia and Africa.  After a late coup to send the Defcon to 2, I was able to use Wargames to score an auto-victory in Turn 9.

Game 22 - Alan's bidding has become more miserly, so I only had one extra influence to place as the US player.  I had Middle East scoring in my hand to start, so I put the extra influence in Iran to start with Presence and a Battleground, then sprung the scoring in Action Round 1 of Turn 1.  Alan sprung Asia early, which basically put us back to zero.  He also had Europe scoring, which he decided to burn in the headline for zero points.  I focused on the Middle East, gaining a strong position.  Alan eventually locked down the Iran-Pakistan-Afganistan triangle, and marched thru to SE Asia. I tried to be a hornet in the SE Asia nest, throwing some successful coups in Vietnam and forcing him to burn higher Ops valued cards to keep his position. 

He redrew Middle East scoring in Turn 3, but was able to burn it with Five-Year Plan, and prevent me from a big score.  However, I was able to play SE Asia scoring after an event allowed me to weaken his hold in the area.  He only benefitted 2 VP's.  

I was able to get lucky rolls in Central and South America, and by Turn 6 Alan had no presence in either area.  I scored Central for a couple VP's, and South for Control for 10.  Alan's rolls had been okay early, but went ice cold from Turn 3 on.  If the Law of Large Numbers is true, I'm in for a bad string of luck for die rolls in this game.

Alan wasn't able to recover after my score in South America - I was at 17 VP's when we reshuffled.  Alan drew South America scoring again.  He took three shots at 'getting in' but I was able to realign him out each time.  The game ended in Turn 7 - an autovictory for the US triggered by South America scoring.

Game 23 - FTF with Alan.  No bids... I rolled high and chose USSR.  Alan's first hand had 2 scoring cards, 5 1 OPS cards, and one 2 OP card (ouch).  I made a coup in Italy and rolled a 6, putting a virtual lockdown on the region.  I also made rapid advances in the Middle East over the next couple Turns, and Alan couldn't recover.  Oh, and the dice continued to be unkind to my opponent.  Auto-victory in Turn 6 for the USSR.

Game 24: FTF with Alan.  Bidding left me with USA and 1 extra Influence, which went into Iran.  I tried burning lots of USSR cards, which helped Alan gain a foothold in France.  However, I used the cards for successful coups (rolled 5's) and started to solidify Mid East and march through the "Iran-Afghan-Pakistan" triangle into Asia.  Alan burned China to lock down SouthEast Asia.

Turn 2 saw more lucky coups from me (rolled 5 and 6).  I locked down Spain and (since I'd burnt Nassar) took Egypt.  Alan used two big 4 Ops cards in his headline and first play to set up a realignment of West Germany.  Great move - terrible rolls.  He only decreased my Influence by 1, which was immediately replaced since the card he used was Marshall Plan.  I struck back in France and East Germany with realignment, and eliminated his presence in France.  He was forced to play defense in East Germany, which allowed me to take France for Domination in Europe.  This remained unchanged the rest of the game.

Turn 3 saw the scoring cards, and I ended up +2 VP's.  I got India, he started to balanced out the Middle East.  Looking ahead, Alan made a strong play into Africa at the end of the round.  I chose to keep pushing in Asia (South Korea, Taiwan).

Turn 4 stated with Africa and South America scoring, and Alan had a (short lived) lead in VP's.  I solidified Europe through Greece and Turkey, and started to fight back in Africa and SE Asia.  Alan had a tough hand, and used his Space Race lead to discard some of my cards.

Turn 5 saw several "bad luck" occurances for Alan.  Missle Envy didn't really help him, and my second play was "Bear Trap".  He proceded to roll 5-5-6-(scoring card)-5-2.  Ouch.  While he was spinning his wheels, I pushed in South America, and SE Asia.  SE Asia and Europe scoring pushed me to about 7 VP's.

Turn 6 saw our luck reverse.  Coups and a Brush War did nothing for me, but Alan was able to take back Taiwan and Iran.  He was also able to start to push his agenda in Central and South America.  The VP track was at 8 VP for me, but the board was starting to look better for Alan - domination in Africa and Central America, balance in MidEast and South America, domination for me in Asia and Europe.  I pushed into N. Korea in the hopes that I would get Asia scoring next round.

Turn 7, and I was dealt both Asia and Europe scoring.  In two plays, VP +16, then Auto Victory.

I thought this was an example of how Alan was able to survive a terrible run of luck, but found a way to start to push back.  I think he would have been hard pressed to win, but was on Space Race box away from 4 more VP's, which would have kept the game from ending.

Game 25: FtF with Alan.  I am US with one extra Influence.  I draw Middle East scoring, so pop Iran and play ME scoring in headline.  However, Alan anticipates and grabs Egypt in his headline.  This is a microcosm for how the scoring went until Turn 5.  In fact, I think entering Turn 6 I was up 1 VP.

My strategy was to put constant pressure in Europe.  With Independant Reds, followed by Truman, I took Yugoslavia.  With the Pope, I put him on the run in Poland.  With East Europe unrest, and a turn where I had big Ops and Alan had few, I was able to nab East Germany.  He was on the run in Europe!

An early key was Alan taking Iran, but not locking it down.  I couped and got control back, and was able to hold it the rest of the game.  Although he got some Ops into Pakistan and India, I used Indo-Pakistani war and stole Pakistan, then took India when he was forced to bolster Poland.

Alan never was able to revolt in Vietnam, and that allowed me to reach and hold Thailand throughout the game.

Central and South America was not much of a factor.

Alan usedDecolonization in SE Asia, and De-Stalinization in Europe.  He vener got his hands on South African unrest. I played Portugese Empire Crumbles, but after I scored Africa with Alan having no presence.  I used the Ops to lock down Angola even after he added 2 influence.  SE African States was a fine coup target for me later in the round to get my required Military Ops.  Africa ended up yielding about 10 points for me!

Notably, my roles were terrible throughout except for two coups and Indo-Pakistani war.  I didn't advance by die roll at all in the space race.  Even a bone-crushing attempt at realignment in Europe via ABM Treaty was a dismal failure... even with heafty modifiers in my corner, I was the one that lost ops!  Alan, on the other hand, advanced far in the Space race and only failed one coup.  

By Turn 8, I was at 15 VP's.  However, Warsaw Pact struck, and crippled me in Europe.  I'd never been this far ahead in Europe... so I'd never considered the power of that card late in the game.  Suddenly, things were looking up for Alan!  Alas, the Iron Lady chipped in a point, then Alan was forced to play Africa scoring once again.

This game went QUICKLY from tight and tense, to a blue board.  Alan's hands were generally low Ops, and he missed some opportunities in ME and Asia.  Luckily I made my mistakes in the first rounds of Turn 1, or late enough that I'd built a powerful board position.

Autovictory in Turn 8.

Game 26, face to face with my friend Alan.

Alan won the bid for Russia, giving me an extra Influence.  I had De Gaulle, so decided to stay out of France.  I went 4 W. Germany, 3 Italy, and my extra in Iran.  I would detail my initial strategy, but it would be too painful for me as Alan took control of this game from the first play, and I was relegated to a "catch up" position.

Turn 1:  Alan realigned me out of Iran with his first play.  I marched into Thailand.  Alan played Vietnam Revolts, followed by a coup in Thailand with the dreaded 6 Ops China card.  He went on to lock down 6 or 7 SE Asian countries.  My only success came in gaining Control of France.

(commentary - I spread myself too thin.  I tried to get fancy with France, Iran, and Thailand.  Alan punished me in two of these countries with solid rolls.  Every die roll went sour for me this turn, a pattern that sadly lasted throughout)

Turn 2:  Wow, what a crappy hand for me.  I'd controlled S. Korea in Turn 1, but now was dealt Korean War.  I also got Castro, Deconolization, Israeli War, Nasser, and Middle East scoring.  Alan was able to get into Africa in Nigeria and Angola cheap, and controlled the Defcon to keep me from having a coup.  He used his huge Ops advantage to start spreading communism through Eastern Europe (and Greece) and the Middle East.

(commentary - Alan did a good job dictating Defcon throughout, and staying out of countries I could have couped for Military Ops.  He chipped away 2 VP's per Turn)

Turn 3:  Alan makes a power move in Europe:  He headlines Socialist Gov'ts and knocks me down to 1 Influence in Italy.  Then he drops Nato for 4 Influence in Italy with his first play.  What is that feeling in my gut?  Oh yeah, desperation.

I headlined Containment, and had a hand full of 3 Ops cards.  I pushed into E. Germany.  I thought I could make him burn what little Ops he had left in Germany, then "make my move" (see next paragraph).  It was my best and worst move of the game.  Alan did, in fact use up his last two >1 Ops cards in Germany.

So I took my shot.  I pushed though the Middle East, taking Lebanon, neutralizing Jordan (action 3), and taking Saudi Arabia (action 4) and Gulf States (action 5).  He was forced to play Europe and Asia scoring as his last actions.  For my sixth action, I went for a realignment with 3 Ops.  I realigned Jordan at +2, but it cost a precious 2nd die roll to eliminate Alan's Influence and gain control.  This left one realignment roll in Iraq at +2 to knock Alan out of this area of the board, and open a path for me into Asia.  Any +1 US difference would have done the job.

Result: US-1  USSR-6  :soblue:

(commentary - Alan initially thought my play in E. Europe was a mistake, but I felt I had to be certain he didn't have the Ops to defend against my moves in Middle East.  I'd be interested in any opinions about this play)

Turn 4:  I knew it was bad news when the US school stared teaching the Pledge of Allegiance in Russian :laugh:
I made a wild play this turn in Asia, spending 2 Ops per Influence to try to sneak my way into India.  Alan saw it coming, and dropped enough Influence for control [u]before[/u] he had control of Burma (or Pakistan).  Ha, finally!  I played Indo-Pakistani War.  I felt certain that the dice gods would finally smile on me, after all of the trauma they'd inflicted throughout the night.

I rolled a 3.

Turn 5:  Alan was at 18 VP's.  He had many options to obtain victory - event cards, space race, a scoring card.  I had some things I could also do, but I held two scoring cards.  I had to hope for the best.  It turned out that "the best" was Alan trying the space race with his first action.  He rolled a success, and the game mercifully ended.

Twilight Struggle can be a tough game.  Alan outplayed me from the first card, and didn't leave me space anywhere on the board.  He kept accruing VP's, and I didn't have the good fortune of "hitting a home run" with either of my desparation plays.

Congrats, Alan.  Thanks for having me over for a game.  I'll bring Vodka next time ;)

Game 27 F2F with Bruce.  I was generally outplayed.  Bruce got huge Ops hand throughout the game.  He had domination of the Middle East the turn after the first scoring of ME occurred.  That scoring card never came up again.  I took Pakistan away with the War Card, and established solid presence both there and in Taiwan, Japan and some SE Asian countries to keep balance.  Bruce was solid in Central and South America, but only Central scored early while I still had control of Panama.  Bruce never got into Africa, I was able to spread quite a bit of influence in Turn 4, then scored it at the end for 11 VP's.

Europe was the difference.  I had 14 VP's going into Turn 5.  He headlined Europe scoring to get it out of the way.  I played Missle Envy, and his top Ops card was ABM Treaty.  I used the Ops (as per the event) to lock down two extra countries in Europe for Domination; 5 VP's instead of 1.  Although he held scoring cards that could have made big points for him, he was forced to use Missle Envy on his first action.  My next play was Olympic Games for the win.

Looking at the board, it seems like Russia should have been on its way to a huge win.  But the timing of the scoring cards was key.  I got some good luck with my roles, especially Indo-Pakistani War, and a coup attempt in Panama.  I also hit every Space Race roll.  Bruce's hands were much more powerful, and I had weak Ops throughout.

Game 28 - F2F with Alan. It has been about 18 months since my last play of Twilight Struggle.  Alan and I met up at a party at my sister‚Äôs place, and bemoaned our lack of TS‚Äôing.  This led to a play on Thursday, using the original tourney rules without any Deluxe add ons.  Alan bid two influence for USSR, which I dumped into Italy.  I also locked down France and W. Germany.  Alan controlled Poland and E. Germany.  He headlined Red Scare, which put a hurting on me as I didn‚Äôt even have an Ops 3 card!  Further, I feared Containment, but thankfully it did not come.  Alan failed a coup in Italy and Iran early, which allowed me to fortify Europe.  I also spread some influence in the Middle East - a risk in Egypt considering Nasser was on the loose.  Alan worked through the ‚ÄòStans, and into India in the next turn.  

Starting in the second round, I started controlling Defcon with my headlines - cards like Duck and Cover, etc.  Alan was a bit dismissive of the early, but started feeling cramped as the game progressed.  Alan took off on the Space Race, but I bounced back in Mid War but spacing some potentially terrible USSR cards and "One Small Step".  VP‚Äôs were hanging around even when the big action happened in Turn 5 and 6.
Alan had some big success in Asia, getting some good rolls and big Ops, but I struck back with Formosan Resolution and a HUGE successful coup in Thailand ‚Äì in essence crippling his advances (Korean War was out of the mix).  I‚Äôd rolled a second coup ‚Äò6‚Äô in Iran, forcing Alan to immediately remedy the situation when he drew ME scoring.  He had little access to Africa, and none to Central America after I‚Äôd realigned him out of Panama (he‚Äôd had a successful coup.  In turn 7, Alan drew three scoring cards.  An early play of CA scoring would have limited me to 4 VP‚Äôs.  However, Alan chose to hold that one until mid turn, while I poured in the influence and attained Control for 8 VP‚Äôs.  As of the CA scoring, I was up 16 VP‚Äôs.  

With Kitchen Debates and a poke in the chest, I was up 18 going into Late War.  We spun our wheels in Turn 8, with Alan making up a bit of ground with OPEC and entry through an action (Allende?) into South America.  It mercifully ended in Turn 9 with Wargames.  Alan felt he‚Äôd made a major error with the CA scoring.  I disagree - he was saddled with 3 scoring cards in one turn.  Had he played CA early, I could have easily made advances in another area and gotten ‚Äòpaid‚Äô.  

Game 29 - We played after a long layoff, late at night, and struggled because of a rules mistake made early in scoring.  Late in round two, Alan noticed we had scored Europe too high (for him) by 6 VP's in round one.  This had significantly affected his strategy moving forward, as he pushed for the 20 VP auto win.  However, being the gentleman he is, Alan insisted on correcting the score. He was unable to subsequently build board position. I eroded his +19 VP lead, survived an Olympic Games at Alan +18, and won on three scoring cards (from his hand!) in Turn 8.

Game 30 - Alan drove to Lancaster Friday morning and jumped right into WBC's Alhambra tourney.  He won three coterminous games to win the tournament (!), ate a fast meal, and settled in for the long Twilight Struggle.  

Surrounded by gamers, podcasters, kibitzers and designers in the Open Gaming area, joined by friends waiting for the Liar's Dice competition, we truly had a unique atmosphere for our contest.  Alan, as USSR, opened with a failed bid for Italy.  As I captured Iran, Pakistan and India, he built up Eastern Europe.  I successfully eroded his position in SE Asia, as he broke into North and Central Africa, and Cuba, Mexico and Panama.  

I had 4 consecutive coups rolling a 4 or 5, then a fifth coup rolling a 6.  I used my luck to run him out of Thailand, Vietnam, Mexico, and Panama.  He advanced far on the Space Race, but was unable to parlay his Headline or Two Spaced Cards advantage into any meaningful board position.  

I won with a Missle Envy - We Will Bury You combo in Turn 7, with the US at +13 on the VP track.  

Afterward, Alan observed a tendency he has as Russia to go for broke with Coups with big Ops cards, and feels this is a misuse of his first player advantage.  He also noted that I tend to burn his event* cards out of the deck early, and he tends to Space Race my event* cards.  By turn 3, he has been feeling the ill effects of this hand management strategy.  

Now that I'm contending with a decorated WBC champion, I fear my work will be even more arduous in game 31.


Game 31 - Alan and I got together Thursday night for a game.  I played with the US, gaining one influence.  I had Middle East scoring in hand, and used my influence advantage for a quick 4VP by controlling Iran.  As promised, Alan avoided coups early, choosing instead to place more influence and realign when he saw good spots.  Early, he had a good realignment in Europe, which opened the door to the USSR controlling West Germany.  I locked down France, and held on to Italy despite losing IP‚Äôs twice after realignment rolls.  I got away with playing Korean War (after taking Taiwan), and used the Ops to control South Korea.  I opened turn 2 with Marshall and NATO, and after taking Spain decided to do nothing more in Europe.  Alan continued to invest in Europe, so early in turn 2 I had gained an advantage in SE Asia and the Middle East.  He pushed back after I was forced to play Vietnam revolts, taking Thailand and Pakistan.  By early in turn 3, he had control in Argentina and Cuba.  Despite some further gains from me in the Middle East, the board looked grim.  I felt good about the VP‚Äôs, which had USSR at only +1.
The watershed event was my play of Indo-Pakistani War.  Alan had no controlled neighboring countries, and I was able to just gain control with a roll of 4.  I marched from India to Burma, couped Thailand, and took advantage of an oversight on Alan‚Äôs end to lock down Thailand.  Middle East started shifting red, but I decided Israel, Egypt and Jordan were enough to hold on to.  I moved into Algeria, Morroco, and heavy into Egypt, locking Alan out so long as he didn‚Äôt get an event on the Late War reshuffle.  Alan made some gains in Central America, but I was able to use a free coup in Argentina to eliminate him from South America.  I was able to realign him out of Mexico, and tip the balance of power back to blue in the Americas.
In turn 9, I was able to play a series of scoring cards (Kitchen Debates, South America, ‚ÄúThe Iron Lady‚Äù) to get VP‚Äôs to US +18.  I held onto Middle East scoring for my last card, hoping that Alan had a problematic event or scoring card.  He begrudgingly played Africa scoring to give the US the Auto Victory.

Game 32 - F2F with Alan, Turn 5 auto win for Alan as USSR.  Details to follow.

Game 33 - F2F with Alan at WBC in open gaming.  Turn 8 DefCon victory for me.  One of our best early games, but in Mid War, Alan failed on literally every roll, and I succeeded on every roll.  It was...unnatural. Details to follow.

Played once. A grand design, that's for sure. But also one that I respect much more than that I actually enjoy playing it.
The see-sawing gameplay, resembling a tug-of-war, as thematical as it may be, is just not to my liking. Also has quite a big dose of luck for a strategy game, certainly one as long as TS.
There's certainly more to discover here, and I won't rule out playing again in the future, but right now I'm not willing to dedicate entire game nights to TS when there are other games I simply enjoy much more.

RATING: 1
My rating is based from a purely wargame-historical simulation perspective. It isn't the cold war, adding historical text to cards and defcon track doesn't make a wargame on the cold war. Where are ICBM, bombers and boomers? Where is the tense decision making of the cuban missile crisis, the Kippur war, the Ryan incident or of the political bungling of the vietnam war?

It is simply a complex euro with pasted on theme. Not well done GMT!

Axing the possibility of a fought WW3 simply eloiminate one of the mayor rationale of cold war decision making (force correlations and efforts in modifying an unfavorable correlation). Working on the basis of the old Pax Britanninca game would have done much more good to the Cold War.

A very good wargame, but does not get an amazing rating from me as (1) it's only 2 player (2) you need to learn all the cards and know them to be good at it (3) the same cards feature in all games so not as varied as it could be (4) sometimes the dice/luck is just against you and there is nothing you can do about it.

Just to mention a few downsides:
-The space race is just poorly done and desperately needs reconsidering.
-Having the opponent's 1 cards is just too bad.
-The quality of the board alone deserves a -1 rating.
-Knowing all the cards is a must, but if both players know them well, the game will become scripted (so I expect).
Although this game obviously suffers from having an unnecessarily high luck factor, I'm still interested in playing it again. I find the theme and its implementation quite appealing.

After 3 plays, I'm still not convinced that the luck of the card draw and of die rolls doesn't have a greater influence on the outcome than player choices.

Here's the deal; you know how there's this weird "three episodes" TV shows out there ? Brilliant pieces of TV where the first three episodes aren't so good or only become so in retrospect ? That's Twilight Struggle. It's a brilliant game, that you'll only start to really enjoy in your third or so game.  It's not that the first ones aren't interesting ,but you'll probably feel like your drowning more than you're playing. However, by the third game, you got a good grasp of mechanics and know the early war cards pretty well. Because of that, the game unfolds faster and you really get to feel the grit of your opponent. In short, that's when the Cold War feel really sets across the table and the game stops appearing so overly thematic.

Mechanically, Twilight struggle is streamlined enough to allow deep strategy and stimulating duel play. There's not many things to do, mechanics wise, but there's plenty of strategy to choose from. Some people might deplore the luck aspects, but I think that really helps to capture the uncertainty of the cold war.

What kept me from trying out Twilight Struggle for the longest time, in spite of all good things I heard about it, was one glance into the deck of cards that revealed the card of Willy Brandt, german chancellor. His election is handled as an important benefit to the USSR within the game - an interpretation that I find hard to swallow, especially as it resonates strongly with the more primitive criticisms of the Ostpolitik of the social democrat/liberal coalition both then and now. This little peeve of mine was not enough to make me consciously avoid the game, but with the gaming glut upon us, not actively trying to play a game usually means it will pass you by.

A good thing, then, that I recently had a chance to finally swallow my leftie pride and play the game. And lo, it was great - marrying the operation/event card motor to an area majority chassis works very well here, and the added twist that makes it hard to avoid good things happening to your enemy is brilliant, since it inflicts difficult strategic choices on you and nicely ensures that eventually, the Warsaw Pact will form up.

Compared with other games of similar weight, good or bad luck in die rolls can be pretty influental and a bad hand can be crippling (try surviving Europe, Asia and Africa scoring as the US in Mid-War for some fun). Since extreme chance also tends to early victories, this is not really a bad thing (as much as I might curse it when it befouls my plans), especially since it bolsters the replayability and serves to even the odds with players of differing experience levels.

After hundreads of plays i discovered that this game is a complete luckfest when 2 equally experienced players are playing. It all comes down to who gets the better cards and when. Even a noob can defeat an experienced player by round 3 if he gets the right cards. The die also adds to the luck factor. Surely, strategic thinking and timely playing of your hand reduces that factor. However those facts don't change that Twilight Struggle is one of the best games out there and the game that i play the most.

One of the best examples of a game whose mechanics and theme are perfectly intertwined.  Twilight Struggle thrust players directly into the tension and intrigue of the Cold War - all while avoiding the war game characteristic of direct combat and conquest.  The card-driven mechanics not only allow a player to change history - but also has the byproduct of whetting a players interest in the events described on them.

The historic feel in this game is awesome as the cards each represent an episode in the Cold War.

Also, the game seems to be unbalanced, since the USSR mercilessly hammered USA in almost every time we played. USA only won once, when an unexperienced player was playing USSR.

This just makes me want to play more, though. I want to be the first in my game group to win with USA. I'm not frustrated by losing and I have a lot of fun playing this game.

Update: rate went up after playing according to the rules (Yes. We were playing some things wrong :D) and with the China Civil War variant. The game was much more balanced and US won.

I like the game but haven't gotten in enough plays to decide if the reason I always get crushed is because.  

(1) I generally play the US
(2) I haven't managed to come up with a plan that doesn't suck.
(3)  The level of randomness in the game is too high.  We all know how well I fair when dice are involved.

This may be the best thematic gaming experience out there. 2 players move through 3 periods of cold war history in what is basically an area control games playing historical event cards which provide. The mechanics are quite simple and it is truly an experience...however my first experience took in excess of 6 hours....getting to grips with the rulesand some of the cards can take a while to fully understand and extend the play time as well ...I hope one daya to play this in under 3 hrs but still it feels worth it

Solid abstract game of influence during the cold war. The card driven mechanics which I am growing to HATE work well here, i think the fact that you have less choices to make with the cards helps...but still feels like the game is playing me a bit...but overall it is engaging.

Definitely NOT a war game though. It is a war-themed game.

RATING: 9
THE classic Boardgame for strategy ("war"-)gamers. Tug of War Original. It is very likely that new games with non-wargame-topic will copy more and more the Event-Action-Multiuse-Cards ...looking at you, Roots ;-) But it is a good thing and Twilight Struggle will stay in my collection forever - especially with the nice wooden-box.

Don't know where to begin describing my love for this game. Played it between 40-50 times if I had to hazard a guess and each game is still as exciting and fresh as always. The game gets much better and more interesting the more you play as you become familiar with the cards and know how to play around them/structure your turn with them in mind, even if they're in your opponents hand. If there is any weakness to the game it would be precisely that which makes it so fun - due to how crucial it is to know the cards to play well, it is difficult to introduce new players to the game as they will consistently lose their first 4-5 playthroughs vs. an experienced player, guaranteed.

I see the appeal, but it is long for what it is. I also don't think it meaningfully models the Cold War in a Consim sense. It is more of a area-control euro with Cold War paint. I'd much rather play El Grande or Hannibal.

I've made this my 100x game.  I've gotten 7 total plays in and this game has only gotten better and more intriguing.  What a well crafted game.

If you've tried the game and didn't enjoy it due to a feeling of being lost, give it a handful of plays.  Once you start to understand the cards it really comes together.

A Heck of a game!

First play was a crushing US victory.

I was not the US.

I will note that there appears to be some issue with nomenclature on the BGG entry for this title.  The rulebook of my copy clearly states it's a Second Edition, copyright 2006, as opposed to a 1st Edition, 2nd Printing.  For whatever reason, there is no 2nd Edition listed, although most owners and fans know of its existence and routinely refer to it.

RATING: 9
Twilight Struggle is brilliant.

Everything about it is fun, tense, and engaging. Turns are short but freighted with import; every decision is difficult because it depends on so many variables, changes the terrain for the rest of the turn, and involves giving up options even as you select one option to execute.

There isn't an ounce of fat here, either. It's not bloated or chromed out; every element is important and has its purpose. It's got lots of depth, too, and I can see why people play this one dozens or hundreds of times. Length (first play: 1 hour to cover the rules for two newbies, 2.5 hours to play) seems like the main stumbling block to getting this to the table often.

It's also beautifully designed, conveying lots of information in clever and understated ways and looking good at the same time. Just a fantastic package overall.

to long.. theme does not entertain me.. after 3 plays I think I have given it a fair chance.. I doubt I will ever play it again. I do not find it entertaining because i do not build anything, its just all about trying to tear down the opponent. I do not enjoy this type of games, if there is no build-up part game gets boring for me.

A classic in the making - now it is!  Solid strategy with card-driven mechanism.  Real game tension.  Tremendously enjoyable.  The perfect game for me.  2 player, high tension, unpredictible, challenging, and fun!  My personal favorite game currently.  After more plays, this is no long a classic in the making.  It is a game I know I will play for many years any chance I get.  Simply the most tense game I have ever enjoyed.  Every game is a series of painful decisions, turn after turn.  I will never turn this one down to play, not in the foreseeable future.

After 16 plays that I have recorded this game is one of my two games being played the most lately.  WotR is the other.

2014 update - at this point I have 50 or 60 ftf plays of this classic. Approaching 10 years and still not tired of this one. Looking forward to the small expansion that is coming.

The best board game I've ever played. I love the theme and how the game transfers the cold war mentality. Also, the game strategy is nontrivial(to say the least) and there is not enough time to perform all the actions you need. This leads to each game being full of tension from start to finish. Will probably be playing this for a long time.

Update, Nov 2014: OK, this game is amazing. 9.5.

This is SUCH a good idea for a game. Very original and so interesting. Its a very fun game with so many interesting decisions to make despite the incredibly simple rules, Im very impressed that a game was made of this complicated topic with such simple rules.I have slight problems with these card games because i prefer to have a more obvious long term objective to work towards and because i feel most of the skill is simply in learning all the cards and counting them whilst playing.The few errors made in the production of this game are being way overstated here on bgg. Its really nothing major (although dissapointing of course).

Too long. I LOVE 1960, and I'm also a huge fan of Founding Fathers--both games using the same card-based system as TS.  think I might like TS the least of the three. Don't get me wrong, the gameplay is great. There's definitely some crunchy decisions that have to be made. I also greatly appreciate (being a historian) the clever implementation of historical content. The game is also very well-produced (deluxe edition). The board is beautiful, the box and card stock are thick, and the chits are good quality. The game is just too long. Any game that takes 4-6 hours to complete is way too long. We played 1960 in just under 3 hours our first time. That was a learning game. Founding fathers took just under 2 hours (with 2). Our first game of Twilight Struggle took over 4 hours and we only finished 5 rounds out of 10! That's crazy. We're not super-quick players, but we typically play pretty close to the estimated time on the box, which is 3 hours with TS. I could see that once you know most of the cards and you have played the game 5+ times. But who has time to play this often? Not me. So, in rating this game, I have to consider opportunity cost. If it takes me 6-7 hours to play a game for the first, and about 5 hours for the next few games, is it worth the investment in time, and if it is, how much does the long play time take away from my overall enjoyment of the game? I'm not sure. It's clean, it's incredibly well-designed, it's strategic yet oh so tactical and it's fun, but it's SOOOOO LOOOONG!

A few side notes: The game is not as atmospheric as I thought it was going to be. Despite the rich history and the evocative board, I didn't feel completely immersed into the period. 1960 has more theme, IMO. TS felt a bit like Risk--dry and calculated in many ways. There was a lot of tit-for-tat territory swaps throughout. Also, there is a HUGE, HUGE, HUGE amount of randomness in this game. It definitely swings both ways, so I won't call the game "unforgiving." However, I will say that certain cards will frustrate you, and expect two equally-skilled players to have their game decided by dice rolls. Neither one of the factors is really a sticky point for me, but I thought I should mention it. 

All in all, my initial impression is that this is a superb game that's too long. But because it's so good and because I like the card system and history so much, I'll hold onto it. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I respect the tension and historical text in this war game. But at the end of the day it's a territory control game where you just flip numbers over, there's just a little dice action, but no real fighting or miniatures to hold a real visual appeal. Its gameplay is very monotone throughout, so it's not exciting persay. But what it does, it does very well, the tension is great. This isn't one that i will bring to the table too often, but will reserve it for special occasions as though it were a fine bottle of wine, to occasionally order just to remember its goodness.

RATING: 10
5 / 5 - Great

This game has potential flaws, which might bother you if they're the sort of thing that puts you off a game - it's a 2-3 hour game which sometimes turns on random factors and it's asymmetrical with a slight imbalance. However, the game is just so exciting and tense to play that I couldn't give a hoot. It has astonishing depth and historical flavour and gets awfully tense and difficult. Has appeal for any gaming style - there's analysis, history and adrenaline galore. Only major downside is that an in-depth knowledge of the 100-plus cards is required for good play.

Update after 11 plays: There are things that keep this game from becoming more than an 8: Playing time can be too long, the events lead to very unhistorical scenarios (the US avoiding Cuba before Fidel etc), the randomness can be frustrating and some victories are not very fun (winning on a Nuclear War after playing for board position for two hours). But I really like the atmosphere, the tension and the mindset of Domino Theory. With the right opponent this is a game I look forward to playing many more times. My most recent play was a USSR victory at 20 VP in round 5. At 13 VP I scored 6 VP with OPEC, lost 2 VP, regained them with Indo-Pakistani War and then topped it off with Willy Brandt f√∂r 1 VP.

The cold war theme is an excellent choice for a board game. There's some complex card rules which makes the experience a bit confusing in the beginning. There's also lots of hard decision which really fits the theme. A gamer's game, a war game, and really not for everyone.  

Pros: Simple but deep card mechanics. It takes a couple of games to see some of the intricacies in the cards and how to best play them. The theme is deep and very satisfying. 

Cons: Action paralysis (AP) is common due to all hard choices. Hard to catch up if you do too many mistakes. Lacks great catchup mechanics. Hard to keep track of scores for each regions on the map. Hard to assess chances when rolling. Randomness can mess up your tactics. 

Sleeved and in mint condition.

Played 5 times, very decent game. Mechanics are incredibly well-done (elegantly simple), and do a very nice job of intertwining real history into game mechanics. Probably our favorite right now for a quick, painless couple hours of gaming (replacing Wilderness War). Where this game lacks, IMO, is in replayability. All games fall into the same arc, and with the card decks segregated into eras, the phases of the game start to feel repetitive. And, as with almost all CCGs, there really isn't any strategy aspect to the game, just the tactical decisions of what order to play your cards in. Finally, the scoring mechanism, which is very creatively designed, adds too much luck to the game (for my taste).

One of my favorite heavy games.
Definitely captures the cold war feel - VERY tense and thematic game. It has pretty steep learning curve, new player will lose first few games pretty automatically, because you got to have at least some idea of the cards to do well. Other than that (and maybe the long-ish playtime) it's very deserving of #1 spot on BGG. I personally prefer lighter and more social games myself, but when I think of my favorite heavier strategy games Twilight Struggle usually comes to mind. It's one of the few heavy games that can be called fun, unexpected things can happen. 

2-Player Comment:

Exellent card driven game about the cold war. USA and USSRR fight to expand the number of countries under their control while using coups, realignements and promoting certain small wars. The game mechanic includes an innovative scoring system that fits very well the period of the game.

Great mechanics, well written rule book and dripping with theme. So why only 7?
It will be hard to get a game with someone. It's 2 players only, 3 hours long and probably the biggest problem is that the theme appeals most to over 40 year old Americans. If I find someone who doesn't mind those three things it's a 9.

(Its interesting that in the designer notes that they say they wanted to make a shorter game to get away from those 8 hour games. It strikes me that this was developed for war gamers who are used to 4-8 hour games.)

Well after two plays I think it's a good game, but a bit over-hyped.  To get really good at it you clearly have to memorize many of the cards, and to me that isn't fun.  I find the CDG mechanic in games like PoG or BtB works better for me because while the cards are important, they are way less so than in TS because in the other games you still have basic wargame mechanics to worry about as well.  Just a personal preference.

RATING: 9
A really special game.  Loved it on first play.  

A game driven by event cards, with tough decisions, different strategies, great card combos.   An excellent insight into the history of the period.  Area control with card driven action points.  No direct combat, but boy is this game tense.

Plans can crumble due to bad dice, bad card draw or to events stealing cards. No room for complacency at all as the 2 superpowers square off against each other.   Makes things all the more satisfying when leading ones side to victory.

Definitely a game for those who are used to complexity and willing to invest the time to get across the rules. 

An easy 9 on first play, suspect it will reach 10 after more plays.

Love the cardplay, which is similar to Baseball Highlights (well, vice versa) in the physical mechanics of it as well as the tactical timing game.  Instead of building a deck to manage risk there's the play on the map.  It somehow feels wrong to compare these two games but I think they have a lot in common wrt overall feel and experience of play.

I don't understand the game on the map very well, but I think this is a function of not having played enough to get the gist of the decks.  Having an idea of what scoring cards and counter attacks are still present will prevent some really dumb, immediately reversible moves.

Excellent game though seems a tad hard for the US early. But then I suspect better understanding of card management would help.

Wonderful card driven game. Is it a wargame, or area control? I'd lean to the latter, since I like it and that's what I prefer. Impressively captures the history and the political spirit of the period. I could wish the production values were a little more polished, but they are solid and functional. Tremendous marriage of theme and mechanics. Neither horribly long playing, nor difficult to grasp which are both pluses.

Finally got a chance to play. I don't usually like war games, even card-driven ones. I had a hard time keeping track of all my areas of control and the scoring really is too fiddly. That being said, I like that it is card driven and the decisions on each card. The give and take between powers is fun and one mistake doesn't make you feel like the game has become hopeless. I really don't care about the cold war, but the cards and board work nicely within the theme and the card effects are great. About 3 hours for a game.

Getting some basic ideas and strategy. Really nice game.

Reduce the grade to 9 because the last 2 games the dice roll, and not skills were the factor.

1 - A player failed 100% of the rolls (space, coup, realignment)
2 - Opponent lost every single realignment roll and was left out of Africa and Americas.

More and more I hate the dice roll.. The bad draws are bad enough.

Started playing 1960, and prefer the way it handles the random. It gives you better control than the die roll.

Got another game in after started playing 1960. The theme on this one is more interesting, but 1960 just flows better mechanically IMHO.

I had avoided Twilight Struggle for ages because the theme seemed like a real snoozer.  A friend really wanted to play it on VASSAL so I read the rules, and to my surprise they really sparked my interest in the theme.  I even went out and got a book on the Cold War from the library--and have read lots more books after that.  The rules encouraged me to buy the game.

I rated this a 10 after my first play.  Why?  The fact that my opponent and I both had yelling, swearing, namecalling tantrums when our plans went awry.  I have never been so emotionally invested in a game.  Our hands were shaking from the tension.  My opponent says that he doesn't think he could play Twilight Struggle every week because the emotional rollercoaster would be too much.  (Quote from my opponent after our third game: "This game makes me angry even when I win.")

If you don't have it, get it.  If the theme doesn't grab you, read the rules and see if that changes your mind.  If you have it and haven't gotten it to the table yet, you're missing out!  Give it a play and pretty soon you'll be swearing at your opponent too!

Always, always, always want to play this.

Twilight Struggle is a strange game for me to rate. I really do feel like I'm in the cold war against my opponent, the immersion is surprisingly good. The problem I have with this game is just that it takes so darn long that I feel like it would be great at roughly half the length. I like it, but I feel like I need to schedule a day specifically to play it, and being only two player hurts.

RATING: 3
By BGG criteria a "3" is:  "Likely won't play this again although could be convinced. Bad."  I have played the game and these are my opinions.  Play is both counter-intuitive and, ultimately, quite gamey.  A card-shark's paradise, where new players have no prayer of lasting more than a turn or two.  Similar to Atlantic Storm in that the cards can create a lot of historical flavor, but outcomes can only coincidentally be mistaken for actual history.  As others have said this is really a Euro-style game with a tacked on conflict simulation theme.  Note, however, the design is definitely NOT "broken" - the 200+ ratings of "1" do not adhere to BGG ratings criteria. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Insanely good 2-player game. Extremely cool (cold;) theme combined with flowing gameplay. The game game can took 5 hours but so what...5 hours of pure enjoyment. Just masterpiece. If I have to complain smt: 1) Dices are too small 2) Scoring mechanism (presence/domination/control) could have been a little bit clearer.

Played this one time and i loved it. Feels very overwhelming at first and you need to know the cards in order to play well. But i think this will come with more experience. Very complex and thoughtful but so good. 

Edit: Played a second time and liked it even more. Where with most games i dwindle away into a deep coma whenever it lasts too long for what it is, this one i can play 3 hours no problem. Every decision is VERY meaningful, the tension is real. This is the feeling you have when you are making a great play at poker... but then not 1 time a evening.. but EVERY play you do. 9.7 it is!

Reedit: Quite possibly the best boardgame ever made. This is on par with Puerto Rico qua elegance, replayabality and depth. I will keep Puerto Rico (elegant strategy for 4 players), The Castles of Burgundy (casual and deeper than it looks point salad) and Twilight Struggle (deep tense, 2 player strategy) Until the end of time :D
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Going into this game, I knew the pedigree it had and had the nagging feeling "C'mon, this game can't be THAT good!"

After the most recent reprint, I was able to get my hands on a reasonably priced copy... The game is good. Really good.

The good:
- Cards all have great flavor and translate well into in game actions. I was surprised at how much theme and tension and flavor the cards and gameplay were able to impart given a 100+ card deck and a d6.

- Managing your hand, resources, keeping an eye on your opponent, and furthering your own agenda mean that there is always a million things you want to do on a turn. Again, this is a great implementation of theme without introducing a ton of mechanics or complexity. Coups feel huge and impactful, spreading influence feels "right", and crossing your fingers during the Space Race all have a connection between what you're doing on board and what it represents in the game world.

- Multiple paths to victory without it being a point salad. I love the corner case victories of forcing your opponent to degrade DEFCON on their turn, winning out of nowhere with Wargames, capturing Europe, or just getting +20 VP over your opponent. Again, it's a lot to keep an eye on, but it all makes sense and does a great job or adding to tension.

- Speaking of, the VP slider is a great idea for this game and I love the tug of war aspect it adds to the game.

The bad:
- The rulebook is a great reference if you already know how to play the game. It's not, however, really well laid out for teaching two new players the mechanics or how to play. (I think it took our third playthrough to finally get to the point where we didn't feel like we completely missed a major rule, even then there were still little mixups we made).
-- With that in mind, there are a lot of great player aids available on BGG and other sites.

- I'm worried about the skill disparity in future games causing uneven matchups. The inherent randomness of the shared deck helps this a little bit, but could also really punish an inexperienced player who might not be able to play a poor hand optimally to mitigate damage. On the flipside, a really good hand could also be "wasted" for this reason.

- Games can be quite long. This may not be a problem for some gamers, but it can be difficult to get somebody to sit down and play the game for 3+ hours.

- I'm not nuts on the packaging and components. The map, while big and sturdy, doesn't unfold flat and is very busy. The game has a lot going on, but I feel like something better could have been done.

- The box is also very small, especially if you want to organize your chits in any substantial way, sleeve your cards (which I highly recommend for any game like this in which decks are used at different points through the game), or include any additional references or guides.

Even with those considerations, the game is worth checking out even if you have an inkling of interest in it, this style of game, or just to see what the buzz is about. Rare is the game that I leave the table and think about what I did, what I could have done, and what I would do next time, but Twilight Struggle tends to stick with you even after it's boxed up.

I liked my only game, but after playing 1960 : The Making of The President, I reckon I really liked the latter much better than Twilight Struggle.

RATING: 6.5
[2011] I've only played once so far and we got a major rule wrong, which probably accounts for the fact I thought it was meh, with the USSR severely overpowering. After this one way, my feeling is that I prefer 1960: Making of the President. Oh, what heresy!

Looking forward to playing it again, but correctly this time, at which point I'll no doubt revise my opinion and decide I prefer this one to 1960.

I bags Soviet Union, Andy...

[2015] It's possible I've not played this enough for it to click with me. It's also possible that I'm just not that thrilled by this kind of game (though I found 1960: Making of the President quite involving); or maybe it's just that this kind of sequenced-history game just doesn't grab me. I love history, but I dislike revisionism. Maybe that's why I preferred 1960 - because it's more like a knife fight than grand strategy, and doesn't feel like it strays from history too much, therefore the "what if?" feels more plausible.

I think TS is a reasonable game; but I can't understand what makes it so popular.

A card driven board game for two set in the era of the Cold War.  This is a gamer's game, magnificently realized with tons of depth, tactics and strategy. 

Has some minor balance issues but on the whole well worth exploring.  When you play this, make sure you put your thinking cap on because you're going to need it!!  Meaty fun for two.

Rating based on first playing.  Game was pretty intriguing.  Would like to play more to see if the game has staying power.  I fear that there are a few too many random elements in the game.

Probably my favorite of the CDG designs, just ahead of Wilderness War. I love how the complexity is kept low, this is a game approachable for anyone. And still has a load of historical feel, without rules load. I especially like how, for the most part, enemy events can't be avoided -- the 'OP or event' thing usually doesn't pass the giggle test for me in other CDG designs. Not for everyone, but deserves its accolades.

Edit: I lowered this to an 8 after playing a ton of games via the (excellent) digital adaption. It's a good game, but there is just so much luck involved. I am a wargamer, so dice don't bother me, but you truly can get diced horribly in this game, because there aren't a ton of rolls. If you get a couple of turns in a row with lousy cards and end up on the bad side of every die roll, it is just completely frustrating. I'd probably prefer a chit roll system, where the luck evens out.

I hadn't played the game enough prior to the digital version to notice how much the die rolls affect the game.

RATING: 6
So stressful!  For that reason, and because it would seem to be a game one would have to play several times and get to know the cards well before becoming a proficient player, I don't have a huge desire to play this one again.

However, if circumstances changed and I started playing two player games regularly, I could see the attraction of this game.  Definitely covers a fascinating period of history.

RATING: 6
I like this one, more than the rating indicates - but I'd never get to play this sufficiently to really get into it as much as I'd like to, if that makes any sense?

The constant tug-of-war, planning and contingency planning, the tension from pushing forwards with a thousand small plans, hoping that one will sneak through and wreck your opponent with something unseen. It's great! It feels like you can always sort of counter the opponent, to some extent, but I haven't played it enough - with full card-knowledge I could see this turning into a more conventional style of eking out incremental advantage, slowly building to an unstoppable momentum.

Too bad it takes too long for me for being a game that only plays two. It's rare the opportunity I can or feel like I want to play a game with one other person for two hours or more, but if I were to, this would be a great choice! 

A very good game!

RATING: 7
Game in a Nutshell: A Cold-war replication where you manage hands of cards and throw some dice around over several rounds as you attempt to gain influence over regions of the world. 

Pros: I like how the game always feels like you're playing damage control which keeps things tense throughout. The atmosphere of the game gets an 'A' due to the implementation of the theme down to the seemingly minor, but really major, add-ons like the defcon level and space race. I also highly enjoyed the different victory conditions and the balance it creates of juggling your own goals while trying to fend off your opponent from theirs.

Cons: The game is fiddly.  All the little chits all over are a nuisance. The quality of the components (with the exception of the cards) in the version I played (non-deluxe) were among the most disappointing I've seen and hardly warrant the asking price in my opinion. But the biggest downfall as I see it is the length of play for the game when dice can determine so much. The best laid plan can seemingly fall apart with a few bad roles.  That's fine in a sub 45 min game, but not one that goes over 3 hours.

Other:  It's probably not that bad when compared to a lot of strategic wargames out there that take much longer to play. I have a good respect for the game and wouldn't mind trying it again if someone threw it down in front of me; but, given my choice, I'd probably rather play 1960.

Best Use: Maybe the best game when you have the time for an epic dual.

RATING: 9
I love the interaction and the struggle that is seen in this game. I love how the cards are implemented in the game and find it quite innovative. The only downside for this game is that I am not able to get anyone to play it at the moment because of the length and complexity required to play (complex only because I play games with non-gamers at the moment). Otherwise I really can't find a flaw in this game, see it as being highly replayable because of the variations in strategy your opponent can use.

I finally got to play my first full game (I was destroyed in the first stage in both other games). Twilight Struggle is a lot of fun, but I think it needs repeated plays to get the most out of it. My full game was a lot longer than expected because of all the card reading, but it was neat to discover them for the first time. I'm not a history buff, but the theme was interesting and very tied to the mechanics. Overall a very fun game!

After two plays (ass kicked as U.S.A. and lucky win as U.S.S.R.), I like it. It has a good mix of strategy and luck (die rolls and card draws). It is very accessible and easy to get into, and the rules really make sense.

It's very long, and it's not an area of high interest for me, so I can't see wanting to play it more than, say, twice a year. And that's just not often enough to learn the cards and master the strategies. That's not a flaw of the game, just a personal preference that's going to affect my ability to find opponents of comparable skill and experience.

I think this has many very clever mechanics, with the DEFCON track, the military ops and the choice to play a card in multiple ways.

If you love the theme and want to play often, you might reasonably conclude this is a great game. You would be able to learn the cards well and develop deep strategies. Games between experienced players would be titanic struggles.

I've taken it off my want list, because someone in my game group has it and I realize that it's just not something I need to own.

I have now lowered my rating to a 5, because as unique as the mechanics are and as well as they work, it's just not a game I want to play ever again. If I don't want to own a game and tend to shrug when it is brought up, it's just not 7 material for me any more. This is one of those cases where an excellent design that does what it sets out to do just doesn't light a fire under me.

Also, as I believe is now required by law, I must say that this is not a wargame.

What a great game!  Played my first one, took us three hours, and I won a sudden death victory by one point as the Russians.  The next two both finished on turn 3: one with a 20 point USSR win, the second as the US caused nuclear war.  So cool!  Great back-and-forth, lots of nail-biting tension, and I really had to watch what my opponent did in this cat-and-mouse thriller.  So many options, so many things to do, so much management of hands, some good, some bad.  A real winner.  As play time decreses, I realize this 2-player game will be on the same timescale as Starship of Catan, for instance.  And how much better is this?  The board is great, well laid out and clear.  Every detail immediately visible and at your fingertips.  Enough gushing?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I enjoyed my first play of this very much. My favorite mechanic is how you have to play events that benefit the opponent in order to get command points for yourself. You can avoid playing events for the opponent by using the Space Race track or holding on to a card between turns, but the forced military actions each turn prevent you from hiding every event from round to round. This causes game events to occur no matter what; it's just a matter of choosing which events to give to the other player. Despite this, the game loses points for some brutally-historic event cards that make it virtually impossible to hold certain regions because that's what history said was to happen. This can make playing the game seem more of a recreation than a alternate-history game. It's a little frustrating to invest into an area only to get kicked out because a card said so. Dice rolls can be swingy, too. This game deserves more plays so I can see how many of these worries are unfounded.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
Amazing game though I hardly ever get to play it due to lack of opponents.  It does take a good 4+ hours at least for the first few plays.  And it's a pretty heavy strategy game which I love, but again, most of my family & friends do not.

But the game itself is about as good as it gets.

I was in awe at the volume of work needed to design the game and underwhelmed by the production value.  Flimsy board and spelling errors.

A marvellous game about the cold war. All events in the game have happened in real life so it really hooks you in with it's historical values. The key element in the game is about area control and giving the impression that everything is fine, when actually almost everything is going badly behind the curtains (but so it does with your opponent too). :D
Too bad the game starts to repeat itself after many plays.

When I first saw and read about this, I immediately assumed I wouldn't like it.  It's a long, historical area influence game, all strikes against a game in my book.  So, I didn't play it.

Nearly a year later, everyone continues to rave about it, and it seems to have nearly universal appeal, so I decided to give it a try.  I read more about it and become more inclined to think I'd like it.  It's a card-driven system, similar to We The People which is a rare long, historical game I LIKE.  I was really looking forward to trying it.

Finally, I tried it.  It was interesting, and I didn't dislike the experience, but mostly all of my initial concerns turned out to be true.  It just doesn't do it for me.  Under the right circumstances I could be convinced to play it again, and I understand why some people like it, but I can't say I understand the overwhelming positivity toward this game.

Completely broken without house variants (not sure if this is fixed in v2), and too random for a game where each side HAS to make certain moves (both strategically and literally via mandatory event cards).

This game gives me heartburn. It's one that I have to be in the right mood for because it's so tense. It's a great game, but expect to play it a few times to learn the cards before the strategies start to make sense. When teaching new players, I like to play as Russia because Russia has a slight advantage at the start, making it easy to beat new players fairly quickly. That gives them a 1 1/2 hour or so taste without having to play out the entire 3 or 4 hours.

MAC OS - Steam - This was fun to play, it certainly rewards repeated plays.  However, the need to know the game backwards and forwards in order to be successful, makes it less likely that I will really enjoy it.  I prefer to be able to read the rules and play the game competitively right from the start, rather than repeatedly failing while trying to grasp the game's meta.  It's use of history means that I will certainly play this again.

This is what a card-driven two player wargame is all about.  I love the cold war theme, the fluid mechanics and the balanced system.  Certainly some tough decisions to make and there's a little luck with the dice (space race, coups, reallignments) and the card draws but it just seems to add to the game.  You never quite know what situation your opponent's going to put you into and you don't always know when scoring's going to occur so one must really be on his or her toes.  Worth multiple plays trying out both sides.

Quite simply the best game I have ever played. Rarely does a game capture the true atmosphere of its subject, but TwS does just that. It is so tense waiting to see what your opponent is going to do - especially on PBEM games! Yes there is a luck element with the die rolls, but it is a game based on calculated risks and careful card management - I think the skill/luck balance is just right. I had little interest in the cold war before playing this, but now I'm hooked.

This game certainly lived up to the hype for me, and renewed my interest in the card driven wargame.  At its heart, it is quite simple, seemingly too simple.  I did not care for how important events, such as the Korean War are boiled down to a mere die roll, but I can understand the thought of keeping the game as simple as possible.  Another drawback is that a fairly intimate knowledge of the cards will help decision making, but I imagine that applies to any game of this type.  The gameplay, though, is elegant.  A great game that I am eager to play again.

RATING: 3
My first play was fun even though I was handily defeated by a more experienced player. My second play was not. Every die roll and every card draw worked against me. I suppose any game can have bad plays and I try to be cautious about judging games by the worst. But the capacity for bad plays must be considered, along with frequency and length. I don't consider this game overly luck-based, but I really hate the coup mechanic and certain hands can doom you. I think it's likely I'll play it again someday, but I am currently extremely soured on it and have lowered my rating significantly accordingly.

Rating after one play.

The Good: Full of tension and grueling decision making. Difficult to do what you want without benefitting your opponent. Great theme for a card driven
wargame. Great design.

The bad: Rulebook needs help in my opinion, as there are a number of things which could use greater clarification. Just witness the number of threads in the Rules forum as proof. 
Also, at $60, its a bit pricey.

Fantastic Game, High amount of player interaction, with lots of twists and turns.  Game is balanced, but has a USSR advantage early which seem to swing towards the USA towards the end game.  USA must scrap for every VP early, and USSR needs to do the same in the end game.  Excellent historical appeal with the playing cards.... just a fun, fun game.  I would say at this writing the games won by USA and USSR about even.  If both players new, then edge USSR.  This will be a game classic

Enjoyable game. It can be done solo, but, as with all CDGs, it's not the ideal way to play. Playing face-to-face exposed me to all sorts of strategies and tactics that I hadn't realized in my solo plays. It also taught me the extreme value of having a great poker face in games like this (something I have difficulty managing). Good game overall, with some interesting mechanics, and--the production errors of the 1st ed. aside--very good components.

Oh my.  

This is almost everything I've wanted in a game.  It's meaty.  It's dripping with theme. It's incredibly involving (it lasted 3.5 hours but I never realized it).  It requires a beautiful mix of tactics and strategy.  It makes me pace the room worrying about the end of the world as I wait for my opponent's action.

This is essentially a beefed-up two player version of El-Grande.  If you've always thought that El Grande was a bit too simple, this is the game for you.

This game is based on the cold war.  One player plays the US and the other plays the USSR; both are fighting for domination of the world (low stakes, ya know).  The game is an area control game at its core (you're trying to control countries to gain points), but it has lots of additions that make the game stressful, highly variable, tactically diverse, and extremely fun.

For instance, there are at least four completely separate ways to gain (or reduce your opponent's) influence in a country; some rely on chance, others don't.  The cards that get you influence points (to place influence markers and gain influence in a country using one mechanism) also have actions on them, and (if the action is beneficial to you) you're faced with the maddening choice of either getting the influence points or taking the action .  But if the action is beneficial to your opponent then you can still play it to get the influence points, but your opponent gets the beneficial action.  This makes choosing which card to use at any particular time extremely stressful.  Scoring occurs in sub-areas of the map at not-precisely-predictable intervals, adding tremendous stress. 

Probably the thing that I most enjoyed was the variable victory conditions: there are (at least) four ways to win the game.  This means that at any moment your opponent might try to trigger an action that could lead to one of the victory condition being met, and thus you have to be constantly on your guard on multiple fronts.  This led me to be entirely stressed out the whole game ("Oh no, what about Europe?"  "Ack!  Now he's becoming dominant in SouthEast asia"  "Oh geeze, we're at defcon 2" "Oh no, the space race!"), which I think seems quite appropriate for the cold-war era "On the knife-edge" feel.

There are so many neat mechanics in this game that I can't list them all.  Suffice to say that I love it.  

The only major downside is the length: our first game took four hours.  But I loved all four of them, and I haven't been able to stop thinking about what I want to do differently the next time I play.

The only other downside I can see is the possibility that the game will come down to one game winning card, which could be frustrating.  But at least from what I've seen that shouldn't happen often.

Ah, Twilight Struggle, my new flavour of the month.  I'll tell you this, any game where you can be down 19 VP and win in the next turn is great in my books.

There are so many options available each round that both players sit in silence as the review their newly dealt cards.  Then once the cards start flying, it's on like Donkey Kong.

There is a learning curve associated with knowing what cards are avaiable in each deck, but nothing to detract from the exceptional game design.

RATING: 9
Play cards to trigger events and place influence to dominate the world in the cold war.

Plays: About 50, counting online.
Type: Area control game = a game where you compete for control of areas.
Complexity: Medium strategy game.
# of players: 2.
Playing time: 120-240 mins.
Player interaction: Competition for scarce resources - countries and regions. Conflict.
Randomness: Medium - card draw, but you control the timing of card plays.

Replayability: This has depth and becomes a min/maxing exercise after only a few plays. You have to memorize all the cards and keep track of where they can be in the deck to be any good at it. Once you got that down, the skill lies in prioritizing regions and the timing of card plays. You have to trigger opponent events to perform operations, increasing both thematic feel and hand-management difficulty. If this sounds like your cup of tea, replayability is high, otherwise not.
Fun: The fun lies in the agonizing and AP-inducing decision making of hand and board management.
Memorability: Decent, for a VP engine. This does create some stories as you fight over the minds and hearts of peoples all over the world.

Thematic integration: Good. Definite cold war feel.
Components: Functional.

Who will like this: Analytical gamers. Bonus for those interested in the cold war.

One of my favorite games, definitely deserve the 10 rank. TS has everything, tension, strategy, replayability, learning-curve and its all in one small box. Even better it is played in a reasonable amount of time, and requires only two players. Since I got this one all other two player games started gathering dust. This is the first game that I can truly say is close to being an equal to Diplomacy.

RATING: 10
Upping this from 9.25 to 10.0 as this is my favorite game still, by far, almost 3 years after my initial rating.

What can I say, really? This game is perfect. The core mechanic is twofold: a card-driven wargame requires strategic piece placement on the board, sure... but the cards and by extension your hand is solely the management of mostly bad card draws, each and every turn. And the cards are filled to the brim with historical theme and VERY real effects on the board. Stuck with playing every card but one, and with a handful of outs (eg Space Race), the game builds on itself in scale and complexity, and the deck grows at predetermined times. SO. GOOD.

Jim's discovery here on BGG of a themed YouTube playlist with era-specific content (speeches, songs, newsreels, etc) that you can start or skip as needed, while playing, made it even better, last time we played.

How to rate a game like this? Obviously this is a brilliant game, well-designed, with a great theme and tons of replay value. It's exciting, demanding and entertaining.

However, I don't really want to play it, so the highest rating I can afford is a 6. Given a suitable opportunity, I'll gladly play a game, but most of the time, I'd rather spend the time playing something else (Fields of Arle fits a similar time slot for two players, for example).

Indifferent.

RATING: 9
Only three plays thus far but yes, this appears to be a great game. Among its greatest virtues are that it's easy to learn/teach yet satisfyingly complex to play, and it can be played to completion in a reasonable amount of time. I love the crisis management aspect of the game: you know you're going to take some serious hits, some of them self-inflicted, but when and where? I have the "deluxe" version of the game, which is okay overall: nice cards but very busy board with a not so great color scheme; requires constant tracking of controlled states because they don't stand out in any way. [3 plays]

grew more dangerous, and cold

Incredibly tense --- I really like how how have to pay attention to multiple regions and the space race while trying to anticipate your opponent's cards.  In addition, I think the historical nature of the cards really adds to the game --- I could "see" how the USSR was developing in Europe and Asia as a result of events.

Loved it and would like to play again soon!

RATING: 8
Deluxe edition.

This game is brilliant - extremely tense back and forth. I think out of the box it's a bit too imbalanced in favor of the USSR and so in the future we'll probably either play with the Chinese Civil War variant or bid OP to play USSR. Otherwise, there is a depth and strategic complexity to this game that will only be unraveled after future plays. I  truly look forward to doing so.

---------------------------------------

Second play - four hours of vicious and intense tactical tug of war that only barely ended with a U.S. 9 VP victory - and only because the U.S. was able to prevent coups with the Cuban Missle Crisis, gain 4 bonus VP from the space race, and squeak by with European domination in the final turn. A work of genius with two major limitations that will keep it from being even higher rated than a '9' - it takes a damn long time to play, AND it's only two player. That means it won't see the table as often as I would like. Still, when it does, wow.

----------------

Rating revised downward after getting Hannibal RvC to the table. Although I think TS is deeper and requires more and careful planning, I don't like theme quite as much as I like Ancient Rome, and ultimately, I feel like the integration of theme and mechanics in Hannibal is tighter and therefore strategic choices are also more meaningful thematically. (By comparison, I often find myself doing things in TS that I know the U.S. or the Soviets would never have done, simply because of my metagame knowledge, or because if an impending scoring card.)

It creates a tension and feel while playing which seriously makes you believe that you are in cold war with your playing buddy.

Whew! My opinion of Twilight Struggle, like playing the game itself, has been on a roller coaster. At first, it blew my mind; I love area control games, and took it to a global scale while marrying it to a gnarly and thematic card play mechanism.

Then, after playing the same opponents a few times repeatedly, frequently introducing it to new players, I became a little frustrated with the game. None of my mid-range plans worked out; opportunities to win the game early dissipated in a cloud of smoke, leaving my final board position weaker than it could have been. Every additional play was telling me "You can only play for Final Scoring," implying that the previously tense endgame conditions were a mirage. Was there really just one way to play this game?

But then I went online and have been playing over at Chantry, and what a difference that's made! Veteran players have schooled me. Even modestly experienced players put up a tough fight. No, mid-range plans can't really win you the game, but there are [i]a lot[/i] of tricks you can pull to give you a significant edge, many of which aren't as obvious as "Oh, I have Wargames. How can I get to +6 VP [i]right now[/i]?" (Hint: You probably can't. But your opponent doesn't know that.)

In any case, Twilight Struggle continues to hold my attention, even after over 20 sessions (60+ hours!), which is far more than can be said for most other games. I probably prefer it online at this point, but I doubt I'd ever turn down a face-to-face game of it. Despite a brief period of thinking otherwise, I find there's still a lot to learn here and look forward to future plays.

While I love the game theme and components, this is just not my cup of tea.  It feels like a "puzzle game" where you really have to understand the formula .  Also, it helps to be able to memorize all the cards, which I feel takes away from the spontaneous nature of card driven games.  I guess that is a issue with all card driven games but this one in particular almost requires that kind of play which is not for me (mainly because my feeble brain is not good at card counting or memorizing).

I like the card system, the area majority mechanisms, the tug-of-war scoring, the way Def-Con limits your actions and forces you to walk a tightrope, etc. Great tension, and the luck of the draw is easily mitigated by skillful play. All in all a really well-crafted and finely-tuned game. I'm not sure it quite lives up to all the hype it has received over the years, but it's definitely a very good game.

Twilight Struggle is not a controlled, cerebral, deterministic strategy game - it‚Äôs not like Go or Chess.  Instead it is an epic, thematic simulation of the Cold War.  It‚Äôs a deep game with a broad, open decision space, but you are strategizing against the chaotic and swingy events of these years as much as you are strategizing against your opponent.   Events happen in this game, big and small: triumphant events, tragic events ‚Äì sometimes you can see them coming and prepare for them, other times they come without warning like a terrorist strike or an assassin‚Äôs bullet.   

My main complaint with the game is that the physical presentation of the game makes it a chore to count influence and control.  Other than that, I think it does what it sets out to do very well.  I am personally not in love with this game as I prefer a game where there's more diversity in what you are doing.  In this game, you are finding various ways to put influence on the board: that's it.  Every turn of every game is about adding and removing influence tokens and that gets a bit samey to me when the game takes 3 hours.

The play is in the card. The tactic is mainly in exploiting the card text. Thus I feel a lawyer would play this game well.

Beautiful mechanic too. And you learn bits of cold war history and event as you play. It's geopolitical game without being political to your opponent but rather by exploiting event as written on the cards.

I don't feel it's a heavy game more like medium-light game.

Twilight Struggle is a fun game, but it is very dependent on the players having equal knowledge of the game.  It takes a while of playing to get to the level where you can play competitively.  I felt like I had to play it several times before I was really PLAYING it, and even then a person knowledgeable of the cards could cut me down fairly easily.  The frustration is finding opponents at your level.  I either demolish or get demolish.  There are so many individual cards to learn, and while you can easily make plays based on what you have, it seems that most of the game strategy involves understanding what your opponent probably has.  And that means knowing the decks.  I'm just not willing to put in the time it takes to become competitive at this game, and be able to enjoy it the most.

RATING: 7.5
Good game. Played ~4 times. Only played my actual copy once but have been playing it on wargameroom.com (very good online implementation). If you are interested in cold war history it tells a good narrative. Main problems are that success in the game is so dependent on knowledge of the cards that a fair matchup is only possible between people with similar experience (will probably level out after ~20 plays or when you know all the cards by heart).

Sin duda el mejor juego para dos jugadores. Es largo pero se hace corto de lo metido que estas; otra prueba de como te sumerge en el tema es que siempre se acaban las partidas mirando el tablero de pies; imposible contenerse sentado. El unico pero es que en algunos momentos el azar es muy determinante bien por las tiradas de dado o bien por las manos de cartas. Un juego genial, sin apelativos.

I really enjoy this game, but it rare for me to have only two players, so I often play this using the fan-made solo rules.  While this game is better and faster with two, I prefer coop games if there are only two players anyway.  The TS app has great audio that I'll use, but my phone screen is too small, and I prefer having the chits and cards in-hand.  My memory is better than most, so I like the fact that learning the cards gives you an advantage against others.  Due to the cards, however, there are definitely best strategies that remove play variability.  I like the strong Russian beginning and initial influence bid to level out play.  I can't wait to try Labyrinth, as that appears to run more smoothly as a solo game.

Deluxe reprint 2014: finally, it's mine (and in italian!).
A long, wearing battle of minds; this is not a casual game so don't take it lightly, even if the core mechanics are quite simple; you use a card over 6-7 rounds per turn to:
A- use its OP points, or
B- use its Event
Basically you try to arm-wrestling nations with your opponent (area control), with the twist that when you use OP points you also activate the enemy event on the card...Pure evil!
Con: this is an almost flawless game to me but it requires long-term stamina, you must keep your focus for hours to achieve victory and in the late turns the fatigue is felt.

It may be the Cold war, but the struggle is Hot. A classic.

Very heavy strategic game. A game takes time; and cold war spirit is well represented. There is tension and some battle, without having really a War. 
I enjoy the card drifting concept, with events and other stuff like this. Cards are very well balanced.
The game in general is balanced, with probably a slight advantages at the beginning of the game for the USSR, but this changes during the course of the game.

I might have played this game all wrong. Might've used too many cards as events or just didn't focus enough in one area.

I can see where the game is going, I just don't know if I like that.

2011-02-10 Well, a year later and only two more plays, I'll upgrade my rating. It is definitely a game that gets better the more you play it, although I'm not so fond of having to "memorize" all the cards in the game to play properly. That's one reason why I got out of MTG...

Definitely has a learning curve (familiarity with the cards is necessary to play well), but has depth and high replay value. 

I have played a handful of times so far, and my enjoyment of the game has grown with each subsequent game. The first game may be frustrating (it was for me, even though I ended up winning) since lack of familiarity with the event cards can cause a player to lose control of an area unexpectedly after investing their resources there.

This game definitely requires a little bit of commitment to get into, since the strategy (even basic strategy) is not at first obvious even to experienced gamers.

The flavor and theme of this game is perfect and reflects the Cold War well... I found the atmosphere very tense and noticed that different areas on the map gain and lose importance simply because they appear to be important to your opponent.

At any rate, I would definitely recommend this game, and will be trying to teach more people in my circle the basics so I can play more often.

As for ambiance and theme this is absolutely awesome.  I've really been getting into Cold War stuff recently  so this fits right in.

The gameplay feels like you don't have much choice in what you can do. Not quite to the point of the game playing you but almost.  Perhaps I'm just not very good at hand management.

It's fun to play regardless of that since it's more of a narrative than a competitive game to me.

8.5 after first play but will probably go up with more plays, which I'm looking forward to. An intriguing game - I can see why it rates so highly.  Must play this more!   Its true that the core rule set is relatively simple, its using the cards that make Ts complicated. (Deluxe version.)

Changed to 10 after playing the PC version. A brilliant game. Most games are a tense struggle right down to the last card play. Some games can be a complete wash for the USA player if the card draw is against them for most of the early war, though.  Requires some deep thinking most of the time, which makes it unappealing for casual players. Worth the effort to learn and practice for the more dedicated gamers.

This game is awesome. Age is starting to creep on it just a little bit, but I still have a blast with TS. Admittedly, the game does seem to be weighted towards the USSR, though this could just be my experience with the game. I'm okay with it, since 1960 is similar with how Nixon has a slight edge over Kennedy, so it makes it a little more likely that an alternate timeline will emerge. Really the only area this game lacks in is its presentation, which is still very clean, for the most part. This game gets a bad rep for being #1 on BGG, but I think that this is one of those games that more people would enjoy if given the chance.

RATING: 10
Initially I had concerns about play balance but I no longer think that there is an issue there.  A highly entertaining game, with plenty of scope for skill and lots of replay value.

A few minor niggles to counterbalance my generally positive impression. 

1. Few of the events are sufficiently valuable to play as events. So the mechanism means that you will use them for movement and hope that they later end up in your opponent's hand and that he will be forced to use them for movement and thus trigger an event in your favour. This is okay, but there are ways to prevent having to trigger an event for the other player. So events can either fail to happen or turn up at peculiar times. A Marshall Plan or the creation of the Warsaw Pact in the 1980s? 

2. Some of the events, such as NATO, are utterly pointless.

3. The DEFCON track is too drastic. It spends the game hovering over the nuclear threshold which means that coups are too difficult to mount and that much of the map is usually invulnerable to coup or realignment attempts. In four games, we only did a single realignment option.

4. The typical GMT production which is generally okay but let down by slipshod minor details like incorrectly printed map, cards, play aids and instant errata on some rather important points.

This is a 2 player euro game with area control mechanics.  If you don't take it seriously it's fine to play.  If you want to be good at it and win, well you can be frustrated by the luck involved with the randomness of scoring cards and the die roll in coup attempts which is a high variance in outcomes and ususally things hinge a lot on them.  Doesn't put you fully into the frame of mind of the conflict.  Gameplay detracts from the theme.  I will avoid play of this over something like 1960

This is fantastic.  There's definitely a learning curve when it comes to knowing which cards are in which eras.  I haven't played enough for strategies to be repeated or real optimization to happen (and I don't know that I care to), but I'd like to be familiar enough with the cards that the list of where all the cards are by era is useful to me.  Right now I use it only for scoring cards (when does SE Asia show up?  South America?)

I really like how the game organically grows out of Europe in the middle of the game, to puppet governments and commy sympathizers as the 60s and 70s pass.  The pacing and tone of the game are all perfect- growing from a concentrated struggle in Europe to a vast, sweeping conflict all over the world by the end game.

Best boardgame ever! Quite easy to learn but very hard to master, perhaps less than 5 games you'll be familiar with all the cards, but took about 10 games to learn the combo and must do/must not do, and to realize some fatal flaws that'll cost you the game. Classified as wargame is probably because of the theme, but basically it's a card driven area-majority game

This is a very interesting game with innovative mechanics. Unfortunately, the impact of luck through cards and dice is too high for my taste. Also, I find it hard to tell at a glance who dominates a region and have shot myself in the foot more than once by playing scoring cards at inopportune moments ("What do you mean, Pakistan is a battleground country in Asia, too? Of course, technically it is in Asia, but it is WAY OVER THERE.").

Update: I can't figure out how to play this. Too confusing. As the rating reflects willingness to play, lowered from 6 to 4.

Quite a strong game, while not strategically strong to it, can see why it is highly rated.

Getting it to the table is somewhat difficult as the girlfriend does not enjoy the game all that much, with one of my friends does.

Card management and theme are very strong in this game, being number one for the longest time I can't see why, but not faulting it as a good game at all.

My husband brought this for me for Valentine's Day 2013 because it's the highest rated game on BGG.  We still haven't played it though.

Played for first time 11/3 after taking into account advice from the Golden Tip GeekList - found the game to be really intense/engaging!

RATING: 10
Upgrading after further play and analysis/experimentation of how to win as the US Player.  This is a great game.  The 'Cold War' is a great theme for a game and I love the hand management aspect of a card-driven game. Errors on the map and cards have been fixed in the Deluxe Edition. It IS impressive the amount of research that went into this game in terms of game play and wide array of actualy historical events.

Looks good, but it's so long that I could play it only twice so far...

RATING: 10
Very good game. My one quibble is that sometimes a single die roll can have a gigantic effect on the outcome of the game. Sure there are lots of rolls, but the value of any one particular roll to the outcome of the game can vary from next to none to absolutely critical. It's hard to explain what bothers me about this, as I'm very tolerant of dice. It's still a great game, though, which I will play anytime.

UPDATE
Boosted to a 10. Despite my earlier quibbles, I still love this game, play often, and am always happy to play.

Really, I cannot say enough good things about Twilight Struggle.  I am learning to love the card-driven system, but the way everything comes together in this game is fantastic.  It is so simple, yet so incredibly rewarding.  I really enjoy the way the scoring is done, the way better play is rewarded, and the way the theme is so tightly meshed with the mechanics of the game.

Some may complain about the length, or the randomness of the dice, but everything about this game is perfect to me.  Infinitely replayable, always fun, and always a tense, fantastic time.  A truly great game.

RATING: 5
A definite skill game which can easily become a run-away if one player is better. It can be frustrating - I usually felt that when things went bad I had miss played rather than a luck of draw/other player was better feeling. Lots of reading and strategy mean its a big mental investment, but under the right circumstances it is a fine game. Best pure strategy intro game I have seen so far - but still basically a pure strategy game.

RATING: 8
The theme works fine (feels like you are watching the History Channel) and a lot of things are going on, so you have to stay focussed on multiple issues and unforeseen moves by your opponent if you want to achieve victory. Strategy at its best! The only negative remark I'll have to make about TS is component-related. I say it's a pity that the gameboard doesn't show proof of good quality. Nevertheless, TS makes a great full of strategical suspense! Very nice to play if you have some old typical Russian communist songs playing from the background... PS: "The China Card".
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
The pacing in this game is fantastic.  Frantic tension that accumlates over a 2 hour period!  There are just so many ways that regions can spin out of control, and you never quite have the resources to keep your opponent's mischief at bay.  Just as you've managed to (temporarily) secure Europe, South America is going down the toilette.  I will agree with those reviewers who write that knowing the cards is crucial.  Fortunately, Twilight Struggle is a good time even when playing through the cards for the first time. For example, in my first game I was in bad shape in the late-war thanks to ignoring the Middle East in the mid-war, but I thought I had a chance to even things out by the last turn.  Well, suddenly my opponent played a card that "ends the game if DefCom is 3 or less" (or some such).  Boom, game over.  After 2 hours of back and forth play, I felt I'd been robbed as I had NO IDEA such a card existed!  But 5 minutes later I was thinking ,"O.k., so the next time I play I'll be sure to ease DefCom back up in the late war."  The only card that I REALLY don't like is the one that produces -1 Ops for the course of a turn.  I wish this card disappeared after one play.  It strikes me as too powerful.  If one player gets to play it twice, it severely punishes the other player (i.e., up to -20 total Ops), and in one game I had it popped on me three times!

RATING: 10
Deluxe edition is the way to go.  The board is fantastic.  The cards are great.  Love the tension of the game.  If I had any gripe, it would be the scoring.  It varies tremendously.  Never really know who is winning.  But overall, the fight for influence and domination of regions is entertaining and educational.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
An absolutely fantastic game. I love the way the theme is implemented in the mechanics so brilliantly, for example the brinkmanship that goes on with the DEFCON track. Absolutely oozes theme whilst also being a brilliant strategic showdown with your opponent.

The only things I dislike about this are the dice randomness and the Red Scare/Purge card which, to be honest, massively reduces the strategy space of every turn in which it is played. I'm very excited about Imperial Struggle which should resolve both of these issues as well as introducing a superb Renaissance/Colonial Era flavour.

Cold war strategy card game. Highly rated.

I find one issue very problematic with this game, which reduces my desire to bring it to the table despite loving it.

The cards frequently lead to conflicting interpretations as to how their effects are properly applied. The rulebook and FAQ do not always cover the various situations that arise. This can lead to arguments and lots of time wasted in seeking an answer. I am surprised that after so many editions/reprints and such broad appeal they are still not covered in the official rulebook and official FAQ. Future editions should update the rules and fix card texts to remove all ambiguities, which have been documented on BGG. I am surprised this game is rated #1 despite this annoying problem.

Next time I come across such an ambiguity, I will document it here.

One of my first introductions into a war game which I think is a good step as it isn't that complicated. Knowing what cards are coming or are possible makes a huge difference, so expect to get crushed on your first game or two.

I'm again very positively surprised by a Matthews-game. We already loved 1960 Making of the President even when the theme seemed stiff-boring for those who have no keen interest in 1960s US politics (everybody in my game-sphere except me), but the apprehension was even bigger for Twilight Struggle, because it looked like some kind of derivation of a war-game, which is the only game-category my wife refuses to play (most 2-player games I play is with her). But lo and behold, it was an instant success, partially because the gameplay is similar to 1960-MotP. It does not feel confrontative -the theme is still fantastic- and there is much more depth in the gameplay that in 1960MotP and easier rules, also first game I've ever played where I like really the dice-aspect. Great game, one of a few CDGs I love, only downside is the long playing time.

Much better than 1960:MoP. The rule that forces you to activate opponent's event when you use a card creates tons of tension. However, as a CDG, I think I still prefer Hannibal:RvC because of the wider strategic options and the additional layer of military manoeuvre on top of political influences.

This games ultimately comes down to random dice rolls without any strategy planning worth doing and on top of that it lasts many hours.

I love the theme and I think it's a very clever game, but I'm not sure how much I'll enjoy the luck of the draw in a game that takes this much effort. I have played 1960 - which uses a very similar system - and liked it better as I had some way to mitigate a bad draw of cards. My inexperience with the game might have also contributed to my frustration as the scoring cards must be anticipated if you want any chance to do well. I am certainly willing, and somewhat eager, to play this again.

Tense and intuitive 'wargame'.  This is actually a game of 'suck-management' - every year you are dealt a hand of cards and you have to figure out how to make them suck the least.

It's not a perfect game for my taste - but maybe the problem is mine. The card-driven mechanism in this game, which is thematic while never feeling heavy on luck, is a gorgeous thing.

But, again, this is maybe my problem.

My favorite CDG. Just layers and layers of strategy to discover. The only reason it's not higher than a 9 is the emotional wherewithal I must collect before playing and the cathartic release after playing can be so taxing that I can't say I'd like to play again right away (even though my soul burns to).

If you are trying to decide on a first CDG, pick Twilight Struggle. Don't waste your time with anything else (I'm looking at you 1960).

Game to game play is subject to wild swings depending on the cards drawn and die rolls.  This translates to a high luck factor. Some very interesting new concepts including when you play an opponent's event as OPS, he gets the event, the whole area control approach, and the "headline event" that starts each turn. A true virtue is the short play time.  It is harder to play the US, especially when the cards drop against you early.

Area-control game with an exciting theme, plausible narrative and deep strategic decisions. I don't like card-driven wargames, but in this case it works very well. Very enjoyable,a masterpiece in its genre. The only problems is that it is very chaotic, andthere are some card distributions where the US player cannot win. For example, if the US gets the three scoring cards and has Red Scare played against him in Early War (which should happen 6.25% of the time), it's probably not worth continuing. The game is also very unstable from turn to turn, in the sense that there can be huge reversals of fortune. You're always a couple of cards/die roll away from defeat. For example in one game, on turn 7 my opponent had something like 80% chance of winning the game and three turns later I won the game.

Received this from my Secret Santa 2006.If you check up on me and read this then I can only say, "Thank you, thank you, thank you."

***I hadn't played one of the new card-driven 'wargames' yet, so this was a pleasant surprise. Clocking in at around 3.5 hours for our first game, the time frame wasn't quite as short as I was hoping, but I'm sure that we'll be able to shave it down as we learn the game.

***4 games played now. I'm still totally thrilled by this game. I played it three times in one day and can hardly wait to play again.I don't know if the thrill will wear off, but I'm sure enjoying riding the high while it lasts.

***10 plays into it and still loving it. Clearly not a wargame, but not a Euro either. Reminds me of the innovative American games of old...

***22 plays logged and I'm not tired of it yet. I'll play this game every chance I get and am happy to say that it has become a staple of my gaming diet.

Probably the best 2-player game out there.  Highly complex strategy, seamless gameplay mechanics, fun card drafting, war gaming style area control, and various events like the Space Race and DEFCON tracks enhance the tug-and-pull elements of the Cold War theme.

Hands down my favourite game so far. It gets better with each play.  Having recently been gifted the Collector's Edition for my birthday as well as my old Deluxe Edition copy.

Edit: Having now owned this for a year and notched up several dozen plays I can without doubt say it is my favourite game to date. There is a superb amount of depth (I'm still learning, every game) and re-playability matched up with tension unrivalled by any other game I've played. I love teaching new people as it is relatively easy to  get stuck into but hard to master.  I tend to give newbies a 5-10pt start so we can make it through to the mid-war and they can really see the fruits of their earlier labour. I'm impressed with how quickly people become competent opponents, another strength of the game. I think it will be a while before the shine wears off on this one!

I love this game, only reason for a 9 is that it is only for 2 players and can take 3-4 hours. I love the theme and thus the cards, but that's not necessary to enjoy the game. On my last play I won on the "Soviets Shoot Down KAL-007" DEFCON suicide card (look it up).

It has dice, and is only 2-player, and is 5 hours long, and has some intricate rules, and has some fiddly components, and has a theme not universally appealing, and is unbalanced when a veteran plays a noob... but, Twilight Struggle is an astounding design achievement! While not 'fun', each play is memorable.

Unfortunately, TS's play length and limit of 2 players had it ousted from my collection.

Only thing holding me back is the 4 hour play time on this one. I'm really liking it though. The tension is there full force, perhaps even more so than 1960, because the events HAVE to happen. However, there does feel to be more luck in this game, specifically because the events do have to happen.

RATING: 1.5
On the basis of a 1/5 game played incorrectly, I liked it well enough. Interesting decisions, some luck of the draw, and great advantages conferred with experience (namely, knowledge of the deck). There is also the resonance of having grown up during the Cold War and lived through some of the events mentioned in the deck.
---
Docked a bit for being over long and wearisome
---
Docked more for same, and also for game hinging on things like: 1) die hitting 5 or 6; 2) drawing the perfect card from opponents hand and dismantling their strategy for the turn. If it's not over by Early War I'm inclined to seppuku (i.e., lower Defcon status from 2 to 1), to make the awfulness stop.

Ritengo sia uno dei giochi pi√π immersivi ai quali abbia mai giocato. Presenta delle meccaniche talmente ben ponderate ed oleate che permettono contemporaneamente al giocatore di entrare nell'ottica storica e delle sensazioni di quell'epoca. L'ago della bilancia tra il potere dell'orso russo e l'aquila americana √® a dir poco stupendo. Semplici ma concreti i componenti e le carte dalla grafica semplice e accattivante. Mi ha invogliato fin sa subito ad ampliare il mio bagaglio culturale sul periodo della guerra fredda. Il motore card driven √® perfetto e ben gestito. Divertente e assolutamente immersiva √® anche la corsa allo spazio. La caratteristica che per√≤ mi ha fatto amare follemente questo gioco (anche se per me √® sempre una nuova esperienza ad ogni partita quindi lo chiamerei proprio "esperienza" e non gioco) √® come l'autore sia riuscito a ponderare l'alea del tiro del dado sulla base della meccanica di gioco, plasmandola su di essa. Un colpo di stato sar√† pi√π incisivo ma pi√π rischioso di un tiro di riallineamento. Un applauso e un 10 meritatissimo. Provatelo se potete.

Not as heavy as I expected it to be, which is actually a positive. Tons of strategy and the game is wide open in terms of how many options you have yet you don't feel bogged down. I love the way playing cards for ops points works as it seems to mitigate a lot of the luck that is often associated with card games by their nature. Overall, a fantastic game.

Most people say the Soviets win early.  I've only seen that twice in nine games.  I lowered the score by one... I have only one once.  I find that especially frustrating.  Probably I'm just not that good, but you'd figure I'd still have a slightly better record.

Speechless.Amazing,no words can do justice for an incredible game.
The rules at first sight  seem confusing and you believe you are lost, like seeing a map of the London subway.

Second play and you are ready to explain it to others.
Third play,you understand that you had felt just a fraction of what this game can offer.

I have played this game for about a month before giving it a rating.

I realize, even with 30 odd plays under my belt, this game will take a lifetime to master. The card combinations, the board context, all come together in such a way that each game is unique and uniquely challenging. Despair is never far away, and the sense of impending doom captures the theme almost perfectly.

As near a perfect combination of game mechanics and theme I have yet played.

I wish this game was fun, I really do. I like complex games, I like war games,  I even have a special place in my heart for US vs Russia games (thanks Red Alert!) but their comes a point where there is just too much. Where you're spending all your time keeping track of tokens, markers, tracks, and which phase of the game you're currently in. At that point I'd rather that game be digital, where I am not forced to deal with all that.
Be prepared to spend 4+ hours learning the game before even setting up, then 8+ on your first round. I would be OK with this is the action was exciting, if the strategy had some flow, or if anything about this game was intuitive.... but it just feel like I'm playing accountant for the cold war, not president.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.55
I'm not an expert, but the game doesn't seem to be as complex as people says. But it's imperative to memorize the cards, their effects and when they might appear. Once you do that, it's just a matter of playing a few games to get acquainted with the usual moves, moves that fans have optimized during the years.

They key of the game is optimizing the cards you get dealt, priorize the actions in the areas than can be scored this round and minimizing the damage the enemy cards you draw will do to you and adapt your strategy in order to react to your opponents actions.

The historic background and the theme of the game it's a brilliant 10. It's a perfect reflection of the geopolitical situation of the Cold War era, with all the struggles of both superpowers. The cards depict events that took place in our history, but they might or might not take place in yours.

The graphic design is OK and the components are OK too. You miss some high number influence tokens, but it's a minor flaw.

I enjoy and like Twilight Struggle, but the fact that to truly master it and enjoy it you need to play it regularly shots me down a bit; as I said, I usually don't play 2 players games and I also don't want to focus on one only game.

I want to like Twilight Struggle more than I do. It is an original game and it has a great theme. The latest edition is gorgeous. Nevertheless, there are things that bother me. I think the game takes too long to play for what it is. Given its abstract back-and-forth nature it just isn‚Äôt that rewarding in the long run. The game shouldn't take more than three hours. The second thing is that luck plays a big role. Being a wargamer and a fan of card driven games I‚Äôm not against cards and dice. However, when you have played for few hours and then begin to roll badly and get only your opponents cards there isn‚Äôt much you can do. That is really frustrating! In other card driven wargames you can at least move your armies without rolling dice. Maybe I‚Äôve just been incredibly unlucky or just don‚Äôt know how to overcome these situations.  Twilight Struggle is a good game but I‚Äôve had bad experiences with it.

Absolutely magnificent. You really can sense the tension and pressure.

Very rich in content and atmosphere, Twilight Struggle reenacts the Cold War giving a rather thorough, balanced overview of its more relevant facts (with further information about them in the rulebook if needed or wanted), that have to be used by the US and the USSR players for their own interest. 

As for the mechanisms behind the game, there are no complications: Twilight Struggle is driven mostly by cards (add a roll here and there) and although it seems at first to be a mostly tactical game, the absence of massive luck in the drawsmakes it increasingly strategic play after play (with the events distributed evenly for both sides a good draw may influence a round, but not two in a row); dice rolls can sometimes spoil a good turn's hard work, though. At least until now I haven't found any serious bias towards either player apart from the obvious streaks of luck dictated by history (South American upheavals, NATO/Marshall Plan, COMECON, Perestroika and so on). Playing for the US might involve a steeper learning curve, though.

Thus, Twilight Struggle is a perfect introduction to wargaming. No player can get lost with the aid sheets and one of the very best organized boards I've seen in my life. Plus, the duration of a game is kept reasonably below half a day, and every second of it is just as intense... even for peaceful players who can't stomach more than a coup per turn.

RATING: 8.5
Eccellente gioco di simulazione della Guerra Fredda, probabilmente il miglior gioco in scatola (scacchi esclusi) per 2 giocatori e secondo molti anche il miglior gioco di sempre. Il gioco √® molto impegnativo e una buona conoscenza delle dinamiche e delle carte aiuta ma le meccaniche di base sono molto semplici. La forte interazione offre partite molto diverse tra loro e richiede, oltre ad una buona pianificazione, anche la capacit√† di adattarsi e rispondere alle mosse avversarie. Il gioco risente molto anche del fattore aleatorio con lanci di dadi e pesca delle carte il che non toglie nulla alla bellezza di questo gioco. Ripercorrere i principali eventi della guerra fredda rende il gioco stimolante e avvincente. La durata media di una partita, specie nelle prime esperienze, √® elevata anche se in determinate condizioni la partita pu√≤ terminare molto prima.

RATING: 4.5
Is it a terrific, atmospheric, thematic card-based 'war' game? Of course it is. Wonderful historical flavours and very, very evocative of the Cold War.

Does it justify its ranking as top game on the Geek? No.

First and foremost, this is not a suitable use of multiple-function cards: surely there must have been a better mechanic than this? It's demoralising and dull trying to effectively rid yourself of a hand of poor cards. There appears to be a runaway leader problem, especially during the first 10 games or so (and, really, who has enough time to get as far as the 11th game?). Too many key decisions are down to the roll of a d6. The board and tokens are naff and poor quality. And it's hard to justify a 3-hour 2P game on the majority of gaming occasions.

RATING: 6
Enjoyed my first play more than expected, but there are too many points against this one for me to ever call it a favourite: given the serious competitiveness of the game, there's too much rolling a die to determine outcomes (eg. coups, and it's especially annoying to miss a few consecutive space race rolls and then watch your opponent pass you in one roll); there are a lot of cards to read, and read again ... and again. I appreciate the amount of flavour on the cards, and the amazing number of historical references packed in, but I don't think I could even remember all the cards that might come up, and this is pretty crucial to playing well. It's also a personal weakness of mine having to deal with a fairly large hand of random text-filled card like this - AP sets in as there are soooo many options in any given hand of TS cards, so many potential combos. Also, luck of the draw is so huge a factor that I felt several of my hands were completely unplayable. I understand the argument that this will "balance itself out" over the game, but after a few hands like this (some coupled with my opponent being dealt a great hand), it's really hard to come back from such a major setback (or the game is already over with a 20 point win). Oh, lest I forget to mention - this game is longer than I'd normally want to sit and play any game. It took 4 hours - not including teaching.

Would certainly play again though. Some of the mechanics are excellent, and really capture the feel of the theme attached. Tension is high, and it does feel like both sides are "on the brink" when DEFCON = 2 ....

After playing this again and also playing "Wir sind das Volk" again, I can't see myself going back to this one too much. It seems for me it has been replaced before I even first played it or maybe it's because I played "Wir sind das Volk" first but for me WsdV simply does many things "better" (or at least better for my taste) than Twilight Struggle, while still giving me a similar feel and theme. 
I know in the end they are still quiet different games, but in the end both give me a similar feel and I simply like the mechanics of WsdV a lot more. 

I do however still think it's a great design, but I'm not sure how much I see myself playing this.

I like the cold war theme and area control games. I love CDGs. I play wargames. My geekbuddies like this. But I hated each game more than the last, and so far I can't be bothered trying again. It's not the tension - I like feeling gripped by a game - it's the sense that there's damn little you can do. It's [i]frustration.[/i]

Every turn is spent putting out fires, "undoing" rather than doing. I'm sure with experience it would be possible to mitigate the effect of catastrophic hands, or poor dice rolling in the space race, but there is too much luck for a game that takes this long.

The most enjoyable part was reading the rules, the background, and the cards. The game made me feel like Damocles, except waiting to be snuffed by a hand full of score cards.

Simple rules from which emerges complex strategy. Yes, it's best to learn the decks obviously--but it's still pretty darn playable right from the start, as managing a small hand of cards is challenging in its own right. Mitigate your opponent's events, maximize scoring opportunities--this is one of those games that demands you manage a dozen things at once, while only giving you the resources to do maybe half of them if you're lucky. Tight, elegant, enjoyable.

Sadly, a touch too long, and it can feel dry. You're just placing numbers on a map after all. Playing people of different skill levels is not an option here either. I ended up trading my copy because it's so hard to get a F2F game going.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Wonderful and realistic simulation of the cold war. Especially suited for older players who have lived many of the events! Its only drawback is that you have to know the cards quite well to play it quickly with a working long-term strategy, otherwise you'll spend a lot of time studying carefully your hand and which scoring are going to come. New players better choose Soviet Union or they will be wiped out from the board by 1955...

UPDATE March 2013: Played this now 3 times within 5 days; there are currently only very few other games I'm equally intersted in playing. It really seems to have some kind of special quality. Rating 1 up to 8.

UPDATE April 2013: The game is addictive. Current rating of "9" reflects that. It keeps me mentally busy even after the sessions are finished, despite the fact that I haven't been able to win even one single play.

UPDATE August 2014: There is BY FAR no other game of comparable length that I have played more often than TS during the last 1.5 years, around 40 plays. 

UPDATE October 2014: Now around 50 plays. Always tense, always exciting, never boring, thematic as can be... It's a 10.

Great game, lots of theme. It is certainly not the #1 game I ever played, but its still good!

Cannot rate it a 10 because of the playing time.

Also lots of text on cards makes it unsuitable for playing with certain types of people.

Also moving it down from 9 to 8 due to the luck factor involved compared to game weight and duration.

Played a couple of times. Good mechanics applied to an original theme.

On the minus side, has to much randomness (luck) for my taste, and a few historical abnormalities (for instance, John Paul II should come on the third deck, not on the second...)

RATING: 8.5
After playing 'The making Of The President' it's relatively easy to pick up the rules and getting started. I'd say it's indeed some kind of more accessible.
Might last a bit to long. Esp the first time, when one needs to get acquainted with the cards.
Also the second game took us at least 20 minutes per round. Knowing there are 10 rounds, one can calculate it became a late night game. But really worth going through it.
Negative : the flimsyness of the board : SHAME for this kind of game !! And the awefull long playingtime. If it could be playd with the same tention in two ours less, my rating would seriously go up, and also the play-rate.

Rich history based theme, but an experienced player knows the cards and there's no getting over that.  Poor components, Chits are way too small, and too much luck with minimum amounts of dice rolls having too great an effect. Game is too long for what it provides, which is at best the hope to draw a good card. I would play Cold War CIA vs KGB instead which I gave a 10!

This game has some VERY serious problems. Several "deadly" card combinations make developing any type of strategy nearly worthless. Play to survive waiting for the proper card combinations for the win. Those that rate this game above a 5 are those that have not seen the obvious.

Cold War heats up again.  Easy to play game that brings back memories of those tense days.  The annoying errors/corrections initially turned me off as I expect much more out of a GMT product.  A fine addition to the Card Driven Game world.  Already came up with a Ronald Reagan variant card that is brutal for the Soviets!

First real war game outside of risk.  Mechanics seemed to flow easily, and allowed the difficulty to be placed in the decisions.  It took a while to play, but it is a satisfying gaming experience.  Not sure how often I want to play just because of the time, but solid game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
An excellent adaption of CDG's into an area majorities format. The rules complexity is a little daunting for your average Eurogamer, but it definitely has crossover appeal to many. The decisions on which cards to play and how to play them are the main appeal (events vs action points obviously), working out the best way to provide the biggest threat to your opponent with minimum expenditure. I love how areas previously ignored suddenly turn hot and of interest just because your opponent has started playing there, in the expectation that they're playing there for a reason (score card to be played?), which captures the thematic essence of the Cold War to a tee.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
The first card-driven wargame I've played. Not a normal wargame, I suppose, as conflict is abstracted, but very well done nevertheless. It's going to take quite a few games to get the strategy figured out. After starting as an '8', a few games in I raised this to a '9', but I'm now raising it to a '10' because of my PBEM experiences  - it's that good, and getting better!

It really helps if you are the type of person who can sit down for long periods of time studying strategy.  This is the type of game you explore.  I would't call it a war game, but liking war history and geopolitics helps.  I'd say you'd also have to like area control games.

And here I thought I'd never find anything more tedious than Arkham horror. I tried to like this, I really did. When at first it seemed dry and boring and the opposite of 'fun', I re-read the rules hoping to find something I was missing that would make it click.  Horrid/contradictory rules in the 8.1, 8.2.4 layout of old AH rulebooks, some cards are events that can be discarded and they are printed 'remove from play', and at the same time, they are underlined to mean 'they stay in the game. All this on the same card! Reminds me of the worst of the Avalon Hill rulebooks. Drier than ginger ale; tedious gameplay/setup; miniscule thin cardboard chits and cereal box game board should be outlawed. How can this game cost $45!!!??? These kind of crap components were already tedious in the 80's when AH was doing it all the time, and here it's 2008 and we still have games that have a game board that makes AH components look like they were produced by 'Days of wonder'. I talked my wife into playing this, using every trick I knew to cajole her past the 'politics theme' and I've never seen such a glazed look of utter boredom within five minutes of playing a game. It was like looking at the Medusa. I think my arm turned to stone. At first I was upset with HER, like she was missing something of this great game, but I realized that my anger was because I was trying to convince her the game was good, when it wasn't. I was upset because I bought this game, and I was duped. 

This is supposed to be strategy, there is supposed to be a reason to plow through the opaque rules and the endless errata for cards/combos on BGG, and yet, you get dice with the game! You rely on card draws! It's luck based! It's like MTG without any of the cool art or engaging cardplay, and takes 50 times as long to play! What a deal! And did I mention this game takes even longer than Arkham horror? There is no excuse anymore for 5-7 hour games, especially not for two people. I overlooked the cheap game components in spite of the fact that this game is roughly ten bucks cheaper than Agricola', a game which actually includes fun gameplay along witlbs of quality components.   (Update: I hate Agricola because it also takes 4 hrs)

You really have to be seriously into cold war politics and US/Russian history to appreciate this game at all, but really, being a history buff for the cold war should not be a pre-requisite for getting something out of the game. This is another inexplicably highly rated game on BGG, like Arkham horror, where I clearly expected its ranking of '3' to deliver some amazing gameplay. Biggest gaming disappointment ever. And I traded an OOP 'Ace of aces' game for this? 

I have tried, but can't find any incentive or joy in playing this game. I'm almost tempted to burn it for the satisfaction. If this is the best the US can come up with in 2006 game design, Europe has clearly won the board game war, and that was with 'Bohnanza'. 

Update ten year later: bought the app. Solved all my problems. Rating up to 9.

With the digital version out, Twilight Struggle has been cemented in my mind as one of the greatest board games of all time. It has downsides: learning the cards takes time, only 2 players, familiarity leads to better games, realignments feel a little wonky, etc. However, the depth of strategy and the push-pull mechanics are awesomely integrated into the theme. Every card play feels like it matters and you'll have to make a handful of really tough decisions in each game.

It's a tremendous design that deserves all the accolades it gets.

This is a great mix of tactics and strategy. I love the posturing for the scoring cards while still keeping an eye on overall control of the various areas. The decisions of when to use events is agonizing. This would get a 10 from me but the dice can occasionally have a little bit too much influence in the game for my liking. I will play this whenever I get the chance though and as I learn the system more, perhaps I will mitigate that luck better.

RATING: 7
1 play - I definitely liked this a lot, with the scoring cards that are built into a draw deck determining where the next flux of battle and coups will occur. There's a lot of 'back n forth' in this game, which can begin to feel a little like a dull game of tennis, but is frequently interrupted by sudden historically thematic swings, which drive a well crafted narrative of its time.

It is a good game, but not necessarily something that I had a tremendous amount of fun playing, unfortunately. Perhaps with some similar minded friends it might improve.

A constant battle for power! The mechanics are simple enough, but the cards bring the game to life, since there are endless numbers of combinations. It is heavy, but if you can handle it, it is a must play (and purchase), just wish I could play it more often. The seesaw point system is perfect.

RATING: 9.5
I wish I could find the time to play this more, my only real issue with the game is the length. I never notice the time going by when I'm actually playing, but knowing that it is probably going to take 3 hours puts me off breaking it out as for two player games I tend to only have 2 hours max.

The game itself is a truly remarkable design, the fact that when you play cards with your opponent‚Äôs events on them triggers the event is brilliant and creates a lot of the agonising decisions that the game throws at you. This really does a good job of creating a political atmosphere, nothing is black and white, a lot of your actions will help your opponent as well as you so you have to weigh up how much you can give your opponent each card play. The turns where you end up with a hand of nothing but your opponent‚Äôs cards can be brutal, but I love them, ending a turn like that and not losing out too badly is a great feeling. Hoping that you can weather the storm and that the scoring cards don't come up while you're not in a strong position is what makes this game for me.

I do think that knowledge of the deck is essential so the first few games will be learning games. As soon as you have an idea of what is coming in each of the phases of the war, the better of an experience this will be. It also helps if you can find a partner to learn the game with as someone with a few games under their belt can have a massive advantage over an inexperienced opponent.

I bought this a few months after 1989, which I prefer. This has much the same system (without the showdowns) covers the whole Cold War period as the USA and USSR superpowers fight for global domination. I can see why it is so popular, simple enough for kids and Eurogamers to quickly grasp, but with enough nausea and strategy to satisfy all but the most hardened Ostfront wargamers.

I enjoyed this game much as I enjoyed 1960: The Making of the President. It was a fun historical game with neat mechanics and good way to have an intense one on one match. However, I feel it is a bit overrated and question its replay-ability. Plus, only allowing for two players really limits when you can play it! A good game, but not the best game in the world, as some think.

There's a lot to do here. The choices are very interesting. It's always a challenge to determine what to do with the cards: either play as an event and lose a 3 OPS card... use a 3 OPS which makes an opponent event occur... The choices and card text seemed overwhelming at first, but the games I played were very close and tense.

Twilight Struggle really does a good job of embodying the tension of the Cold War.  As in many games of this type, you're trying to advance your own goals while stopping your opponent from advancing his.  While this game is asymmetric, the types of things you're trying to do are similar enough that you do get in each other's way.  I really like how the scoring is card-based--you know what scorings might be coming based on the stage of the game, and you might be able to guess based on your opponent's actions, but really it's up to the players.  All around, this is a really deep, rewarding game.

RATING: 8.5
I never imagined that a two-player game, with strong historical theme and including dice and cards could be so tactically fascinating and satisfying. I have played this more than any other game since buying it, largely with my brother. What amazes me is that although I have beaten him every time, he always comes back for more - the game is that compulsive and gripping. The multiple paths to victory can give it a 'knife-edge' feel sometimes which I find in very few other games, with one player on the verge of control in Europe (which gives an automatic win) and the other racing to dominate the rest of the world before the 'Europe scoring' card comes round again. Can't recommend highly enough.
Drawbacks:
a) Playing time (2-4 hours) is quite long
b) Knowing what cards are out there gives a huge advantage to experienced players

Comment: This game really benefits from multiple plays. Each time you play and learn what's in the deck you have a much better shot at controlling your hands and guessing what your opponent has. Really tense game and a ton of strategy.

I had initially rated the game as 8.0/10.0, but after getting to know the deck and played more, it's a solid 10! The Cold War theme and the Mutual Assured Destruction doctrine are brilliantly themed in the game, with players juggling between multiple crises.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
I can hear my heart beating in my chest and get all jittery every single time I play. The tension is palpable each time.

The greatest innovation is that most cards are explicitly beneficial for one party in an asymmetrical distribution that evolves over the course of the game. This truly characterizes each side you play with a certain approach. However, both players draw from a shared deck, leaving you with some of your opponent's cards. Choosing when to play cards that explicitly hurt you and attempting to mitigate a disaster every turn is the greatest element of this game‚Äîyou don't know what cards your opponent has, and what they might be able to do this round. Any decision your opponent makes leaves you paranoid and afraid that a card you know is about to drop might devastate your presence in a region or disrupt the plan you had for the rest of the round. This ludo-narrative harmony with the Cold War is just truly exceptional.

This is a wonderful game of second-guessing and faking out your opponent. There is a very nice range of exceptionally useful cards, and a great degree of anxiety that can be driven over cards that have the potential to lose you the game if played incorrectly. There's an interesting degree of hand management, too, where it's important to be prepared for cards your opponent can play that leave you playing into a nuclear holocaust. Every hand you draw can be played excellently or poorly, and it's all down to how you place influence, plan ahead, and manage disaster. Everything seems critical, everything is vulnerable, and every move is terrifying.

I strike half a point off for the small elements of luck in this game when dealing with realignments and coups, but even that fits thematically with the true uncertainty that marked every move made during the Cold War.

One of the especialness of the game lies for me therein, that you get encouraged to explore the deepness of the game, even if the effect of your decisions are not immediatily accessible for you, in the initial game plays.

The curiosity to master this master piece increases with each gameplay.

Unjustifiably long latency for the german version, especially for "just" translating a rulebook and card texts. The gameboard stayed untranslated.

Twilight Struggle is tricky, though and demands your full attention for a couple of hours. But that doesn‚Äôt matter - you will have fun and won‚Äôt notice the time fly by.

The historical background comes alive and the game mechanics manages to create a real dramatic build up through the turns. And as a player you are highly motivated. In other words: the theme is great.

Only played once - rating could go up (to a 10) with further plays.

First play with my couple. Though I really enjoy it (It seemed tense till it ended and kept my atention during all the game) it absolutely turned her off. Not her kind of game at all... and since every time I play a 2 player game, I do it with her. I'm exchanging it for another one like Caylus (within Madrid, Spain), which is the kind she enjoys better and since I also do (we love the Le Havre one)... I guess it's better this way than keeping it in a closet without use... sadly.

Amazing 2 player cold war game! The players spread their influence around the world, overthrow governments and realign countries using clever card play, so they can be the dominant force when scoring comes. They also have to keep an eye on the defcon level, because a nuclear war equals an automatic loss.

This is an area majority game with a lot of theme. All the cards represent real events that took place during the cold war. These events are very cleverly implemented and force the player to make really tough decisions. Hand management is crucial but the overall positional strategy on the map also plays a major role. Forcing the players to execute an opponent's event when they use the ops value is sheer genius and really enhances the hand management aspect! 

Why is this not a 9.5? Because I haven't played it enough, but I suspect it will be in a not so distant future.
[Update]: This is a 9.5!

Had some very tense and interesting games. But also some extremely frustrating ones. This game is a CDG, but the D sometimes seems to stand for Dictated instead of Driven. 
4 scoring  Cards in one Hand is killing, some Cards in a US hand are mandatory to play, and with a agressive Russian play result in an unavoidable Nuclear War. Russia goes first and can often set DEFCON @ 2.

So will play and with at least a decent draw will enjoy. But if the deck is against me, will again avoid it for some time.

RATING: 9
The mid game is super fun, but by the end game there is so much on the board that it becomes a little difficult to process that much information. 

It just seems a bit too long. Perhaps they could have scaled the map down a bit to make the same experience move a little faster. 

With so many spaces available, I find myself losing interest in certain section of the board after it seems to be somewhat locked down. In reality the Cold War was somewhat less expansive and somewhat more long term tit-for-tat in the same areas than my in-game experience.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
It took a long time before I had a chance to try this game. It truly was worth the wait!
This is like a stripped Paths of Glory, only the juicy core is left. Playing time remains in ~2 hours and the number of exceptions is minimal.

The cards are a chapter of their own. You really have to know what can be expected, otherwise it's too dangerous to play certain cards. Well, it's not a prerequisite to know those cards, but it helps. I had a great deal of fun in my first game even though I knew nothing what to expect.
And yet again you depend a lot on the card draws you make at the end of your turn. This game could have used something else than space race to dump the cards with your opponent's symbol.

At some situations this feels a bit too luck-based game, but if that's the price to pay from otherwise non-heavy and yet working system - then so be it! 

I'll always prefer this to 1960: Making of the President because of its theme and also this one is preferred to Paths of Glory because of its simplicity and sensible playing time.

This one I'll definitely buy immediately when I have the chance!

After 2 plays, I think it is amazing.  It will take about 10 games before I feel comfortably with the deck and likely another 10 before I start to feel I know the game well, but that's quite alright for a game like this when I am really enjoying each play and wanting to get it on the table again as soon as I can.

Good card game. Excellent atmosphere and theme! But a card game which lasts more than 3 hours? And as typical with card games you can get hosed by very bad cards at the wrong moments. If you are playing a card game then it should be possible to mitigate bad luck somehow, OR the gamne should be short.
But only played once so far and that was a very slow first time since there is a lot of text on every card.
I rate it a 7 to start with and then we'll see if I upgrade it. Promising though. And the hours went fast most of the time.

For a card and chit-driven war game to rise to the top of the geek obviously takes something special.

In addition to the standard "deluxe" current version of the game, I managed to pick up a limited edition wooden box "Collectors' Edition", which is not only very nice, with its solid wooden components, but It also incorporates some mini-expansion and promo "what if" event cards.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
This has become an acknowledged classic. Card-driven, the mechanism allows players to make some use of cards that would otherwise only benefit your opponent. Players vie for influence over countries in Europe and the rest of the world.  An elegant design means that this works surprisingly well as a historical simulation. I may draw on this when I finally come to launch my game simulating the 'domino theory' and incorporating actual dominoes.

It may be sacrilege to say so, given the popularity of this game among serious gamers, but it is surprising how luck-driven the game can be - not just over the choice of cards but in the luck of dice rolls. I appreciate that this is a game about managing and mitigating damaging cards and events but still...

7/16/12 - It's a little fiddly and I don't know if a 2 player game deserves the top spot but it's pretty fun. There are a lot of significant choices and the game is really thematic. I'm glad to have it in my collection.

10/17/12 - I wanted to play this game one more time before I traded it but I realized this game gets a lot better the more times you play it. I bumped up the score to 9.

10/17/12 - Played again, this time correctly and the game was much better. I was going to trade it but I'm deciding to keep it.

RATING: 6
My rating suffers because we are not primarily war gamers and also our game ended very quickly. I found the concept of the game really appealing, but overall the choices seemed very obvious -- almost dry and too mechanical (this may have been a function of my opponent, who didn't play optimal moves in our first game.) 

I found the mechanics of the game to be somewhat similar to 1960: The Making of the American President, which I really enjoyed more. 1960 is more forgiving of sub-optimal moves (at least in our limited experience with these two games) which made it more enjoyable for me.

The definitive Cold War game that is easy to learn but hard to master. Anyone born during the cold war period should definitely consider trying this game out. It does a fantastic job of putting historical events into their proper context of how they swayed influence between the reigning two super powers of the time.

From a war gamer's perspective this is a light card driven war game essentially about area control but it should not be easily dismissed if you have not played it simply because it lacks military units. Twilight Struggle will have you pondering strategies long after a game is over due to its depth of play.

Pros:
* Greatly implemented theme.
* Strategies are conditional to your hand of cards each turn.
* The deluxe edition improves the game components to what I would consider a modern day average quality.

Cons:
* It is easy to incorrectly keep track of action rounds and counting the cards played will not always be accurate.
* Slightly wonky change to the number of action rounds mid-game.
* Games are more likely to end before the late war period even begins.

I do not consider any of my complaints enough to subtract anything from the rating. I find the game too intriguing.

Not sure what I think of this.  I generally like my 2-player games to be shorter than this one goes (at least as a 1st time player) and I don't think I'll want to play it enough to speed up play to a level that makes me more willing.  It's fairly clever, but a run of bad luck can cripple some solid play, which is odd, given that it's a 2+ hour game.  Played it once, and haven't really felt the urge to play it again, but this may partly be because I don't like long 2 player games as a general rule than the fact that it's not good.

RATING: 6
The number 1 of BGG (still on 25/05/2015). Somehow this game never appealed to me. But as Jan wanted to play this and it is number 1, I gave it a try.

So impressions after 1 play: why is this number 1 and gets such a high rating from so many players? 

First problem I have with this game that it is even stated in the rules (according to Jan who explained the rules) that you have a better chance of winning with the US then with the USSR. Then again I won with the USSR as a newbie and maybe the USSR-part is just harder to grasp? In Mr. Jack the role as Jack is also harder for new players to play good then the one of detective. If this is the same for this game, I suppose that's something I can live with.

What for me however is too annoying for me is the dice part. The equations to calculate the 'coup'-result reminded me of some Italian games, something I dislike. But just the fact that such a long game can be decided with 1 good or bad dice roll, just makes this not worthy of playing for me. I for example won our game by reaching 20 victory points because I had the luck of rolling a 1 on the space track and so score the 2 points I was missing. 

The third part that annoys me in this game is some of the cards. You can try to built up something and 1 card played by your opponent can sometimes just take away the control you needed and you can't do anything against it.

Jan likes the game about the fact that you have to take care that you have to play the cards you get as smart as possible so that the advantages you give to your opponent are as reduced as possible. That is indeed the clue of this game and a mechanism I can't say I have seen in other games. Then again, if you get 8 US-cards as the USSR-player, you won't be that happy with this gaming mechanism :s

Conclusion: the Ameritrash-factor in this game is too high for me.

First play was impressive, though as the Soviets I got my clock cleaned.  I didn't play well, but was concerned that bad card draws can really contribute to a defeat.  Still, it's a really fun game, with lots to do and high anxiety.  Will definitely become a staple of two-player game night.

This is a mildly fun game for casual play, but I consider it being one of the weakest CDGs available, too long, too many rules and too chaotic for what it gives.

I'm stunned about the hype this game has reached.

Board Game Rank 1? I accept this - De gustibus non est disputandum

Wargame Rank 1? If there is a wargame here then it is well hidden. Chess, an abstract game, (the cover of the TS-box implies relation) is ten times more a wargame but has no Wargame Rank at all.

Strategy Game Rank 1? Strategy admittedly helps winning, but this game is so saturated with chaos, rotates about thousand things here and there and then the really important space program is purely driven by chance!! There are card combos that can kill you almost immediately like a smart-bomb - that make it strategy #1?!?

"Go", another abstract game, breathes strategy, but alas, it has no Strategy Game Rank at all!

C'mon! That's unreasonable.

At first I bought into the idea that this was the best game out there. But when I got around 50 games, I realized that this is a hugely overrated game. Its biggest merit is the quality of the components, the theme and how every event and country connection work well together - which on the deluxe edition really makes you believe that you are playing a top ten game.
The early war cards script the game a lot (when playing with someone who makes intelligent choices and maximizes the events and points). With only 34 cards in early war played three times, it gets easy to count the cards and to figure out things you should never do (ex: USSR take over Japan or Australia or US taking over Cuba and Egypt during early war). This is the big limitation of the game: since you are always playing with the same cards, events and values, a player that knows the cards and the odds of certain events to happen acquires an definite edge on empire expansion that has less chance of being thwarted at certain stages of the game (early, middle and late war). But despite this, the most determining factor of winning or losing are the results of your die rolls when doing a coup or realignment. If you lose too many, your opponent will quickly nail you to the ground. Worse, getting played Red scare 2-3 times in a game can also make a comeback impossible if you are the USSR. It boggles my mind that a game with so few die rolls manages to make those same die rolls override all other factors (skills, card play, strategy etc...). The second big killer is being dealt bad hands. Many noobs think that a couple of bad hands may not affect the game that much, but what they fail to consider is that if the end result of those bad hands cause you to lose certain key countries, the game will only slide towards an inevitable victory for the player with average luck on his next cards received (which to me is not the hallmark of a great strategy game). When a player has a death grip on certain continents and the only events that would allow a special event have passed, some feats become impossible. Another downside is the concept of scorecards: since there is no balancing you may end up holding so many that you end up losing valuable influence points you could be placing on the board while your opponent gets an edge on you while you often only end up giving him more points. I was once dealt 3 score cards in midwar which made me score 3 out of 7 turns... ridiculous. Another comment on score cards: you never know when a score card will come into play or not. Sometimes Europe comes 4 times in a game sometimes 1... scoring becomes more a question of lucky timing than overall strength in the world or real strategy (which makes no sense when you think about it). If someone dominates a high point zone and that score card pops up two times in early war, they will have to work very hard to lose that game. 
Also, experienced players will eventually end up playing games that will end up resembling themselves: Preventing control of Europe early on, dodging events of a couple of specific opponent cards, making coups in the same continent choke points and players eventually memorize the different cards of each phase (early, mid and late war) and know by heart the boons and pitfalls that are coming. Finally, there are ways that you play certain cards that allow your opponent to provoke the end of the world by going to Defcon 1 and declaring him the winner (yeah, that makes no sense either) and can undermine an otherwise compelling game - can you recall a game that spontaneously combusted half-way through and that you wanted to replay right away?
This game stays fun until you learn all the cards, odds and strategies the game has to offer - which is usually the point when you are supposed to love a game more- but in this case, you only realize that the game's entire core mechanism is luck. There is a clear storyline: USSR starts strong in early war but Mid war offers the US player some very powerful cards to catch up. However, if you are USSR and you are not ahead after turn 4, you can only win if the US player`s strong cards are never played. If the US player gets his cards, you are slowly sinking deeper and deeper. 
All in all, I enjoyed TS a lot when I thought that my wins and losses were dependent on my skills or lack thereof. But once I mastered the cards, I realized that luck played such a major factor in this game that experienced players can lose simply by rolling 3's or less and having bad cards in his hand on the wrong turns. I would of liked a deep strategy/wargame but hardcore gamers quickly realize that this is a classic American game: good cards and good rolls win the day. The only time this game feels great is when it gets a euro flow (tight scoring) and no player has an outrageously good hand on the same turn the other has to manage a horrible one - you may then feel for the duration of a game that strategy actually exists in the hand management. It is unfortunate that this game is very unbalanced when it comes to cards played, cards not played and the story arch. If there existed a way for players to counter the dumb luck of the cards drawed, this would be a perfect game. I would personally suggest to remove Red scare after one use and if a player has three score cards in a turn there should be a reshuffle.

Awesome game. Though not something I would like to play with competitive players of this, I have found casual play to be really interesting.

Strong points of this game:-Easy to explain and learn rules-Very tough decisions to make and lots of tension-LOTS of neat historicial flavor-A short enough playing time, that it's a game you can break out on a weeknight-Every time I've played it leaves me thinking about what I would have done different for quite awhile after the game is over, and it provokes discussion between the 2 players afterwards as well.Bottom line: A very well designed and very fun game.

Great theme and I wanted to like this game a lot - unfortunately it turned out to be the most disappointing game I've bought.  I dislike games where it's impossible (or virtually so) to plan ahead, and the card-drafting mechanic eliminates most opportunities for forward-planning.

Ultimately the game relies much more or luck than skill, which was the biggest disappointment.  It's the only game that I've decreased my rating for with each subsequent play.

Going to try this again as it transpires we may have played a rule significantly wrong.  Traded for a copy, and we'll see...

I know people love this game, but I sometimes find it difficult to play with people. It's excellent when two experienced players are playing against each other, but it's very difficult to keep it interesting for players of very different skill levels, as familiarity with the cards and strategies is such an integral part of the game. 

Also, it can be a bit fiddly; in a few games, my opponent and I have forgotten to adjust the track every time someone has played a card, and it can be tricky to "back-track" the game and figure out how many turns have been played.

In spite of all that, it's a great game with a ton of Cold-war theme, and I can understand the praise it receives.

Questions about balance are kinda silly.  While this is not a "historical simulation" it does streamline the idea of a historical narrative into the play.  If the US "won" the Cold War then I'd have no problem with the way this plays out, I see an early game advantage towards the Soviets and late game USA advantage.  A 10 after seven plays on the table and five online.

My all-time favourite. A belter, oozing with theme and gripping from start to finish.

Suprisingly for a game attempting to simulate the Cold War, its mechanics are rather simple. The whole game revolves around either adding influence, reducing the influence of your opponent in countries or both - all this through four basic actions: event play, direct placing of influence, coups and realignments 

What makes TS a brilliant game is the features that guarantee its balance. First, the nature of card play.  You will often be teared between using much-needed ops points, on one side and benefiting from a favourable event (if it's a card marked as yours) or prevent the unleashment of an event favourable to your opponent (if it's marked as his).

Secondly, there's DEFCON. DEFCON starts at 5 and each coup d'etat in a battleground country reduces DEFCON by 1. Should DEFCON ever get to 1, Nuclear War ensues. If that occurs in your action round, you lose the game on the spot.  This makes all the the difference, restricting the use of coups and some powerful events and increasing the tension.    

TS hooks you as and makes you feel like you are in the  a White House or Kremlin, trying to sway countries to your side through every (usualy shady) mean available and  second-guessing your opponents next move, while standing on the edge of nuclear disaster. 

This is an outstanding game, worthy of all the praise you can see throught BGG.

I've now played this game several times and I will always look forward to playing it again.  However, as I am a rookie to this game (as are the people I've been playing this with), we are having difficulty getting past the Early War stage, as the US is constantly being destroyed by the USSR.  It makes for a quick game, but it is also very unsatisfying.

So - absolutely not going to pack this game in at all - however, I'm looking forward to playing again to learn the strategy of keeping the US alive past turn 3!

Awesome game! The learning curve is a little more steep than a deep euro. The faq is longer than most rule books I've read.  Simple enough once you play a few turns. Seems simple in that you are only playing one card at a time, but there is a LOT to consider. No chance for a beginner to beat an experienced player, but the game is so riveting you won't mind.

A little pricey when you consider that the map is just flimsy cardboard that won't lay flat. But the quality of the game is good enough to overlook that. 

Plan on 3hrs for a full game. 

Update: After losing a 3 1/2 hour game because the Soviet player got the Aldrich Ames card, I'm dropping this to a '7'. Luck swings a little too much for my taste.

The mechanisms in this game are beautiful and elegant, the history is interesting and plays back into the theme and mechanics, and it's not super heavy. This game is about two world powers fighting for influence across the planet. On a player's turn they play cards for either the cost of the card in action points which allow them to play tokens and take actions or they can play the card for it's effect. At the start of the game, the communists have the advantage, but the longer the game goes, the more the capitalists take hold and grow in power. Fascinating game.

Twilight Struggle was the last game in the top 10 I hadn't played, and since I've always been interested in that period of history I'd been really looking forward to getting round to it. I swapped my copy of El Grande for it in a UK math trade and played a couple of times face-to-face and four times online (using the excellent wargameroom app) in Jan '09. It has got inside my head more than any game I've played in a long time. I absolutely love the multi-dimensional hand-management and the way each turn is almost a mini-game (which works particularly well online as you can play episodically). There's something about 2-player games that make you really care about winning or losing, and playing the same opponent repeatedly has allowed us both to develop our skills a lot, especially avoiding early war wipe-out when playing as USA. Our latest game has just entered turn 7, poised on a knife-edge, and I can't wait to see what happens! I have slight worries about the flat dice rolls, and it can be a really long game face-to-face, but those are minor quibbles about an undeniable masterpiece.

A really great game with loads of interesting decisions each turn, but it's a big time commitment and can have some swingy die rolls.  Also, the new cards have tons of mistakes and really don't add much to the game (Special Relationship: Really?  What were you thinking?).  They seem like a missed opportunity more than anything.  Still, a very worthy game for a very interesting period in history.

Chrome de la chrome. Every card alters the rules. Very random and out of control (so very much on-theme). Strategy consists of somewhat arbitrarally deciding to build-up influence in a particular region (Africa, Asia, S. America, etc.) in hopes of a scoring event occuring down the road for that area. Tactics consist of deciding which cards in your hand are the worst and how to ditch them (which appears to be the basis for the space program mechanic). Feels more like watching a movie and waiting to see how it turns out rather than being a player shaping the events.

Great game, though not really a wargame.  But what it's designed for is FUN, and at that it wildly succeeds.  It is very easy to learn the rules and start playing, immediately turning very addictive.  The production and components make it extremely compelling, GMT continuing to show they know exactly how to produce the best product out there.  While it is not designed for solitaire, that is a good way to learn the game, and even playing alone is great fun.  Every play you make is a tough decision as there are always umpteen options of what you can do, giving a lot of depth to the game.  The tweaks in the second addition while slight add to the playability of the game.

I do not agree with this game's version of our recent history. I don't think that's how the world works. So, in a way, it is overly simplistic; interesting, as it is a game that pretends to be a simulation of all, it has a complex gameplay of sorts.

EDIT: It is really good to teach the younglings the main events of the time. But you'll need to complement with your own info if you want them to really know what happened.

Wow! I assumed that this game was just being hyped by Eurogamers that finally had a 'wargame' they could actually understand and play. I was wrong; this is a terrific game (although it sits on the Euro end of the Wargame shelf). Played a 'quick start' trial game where we made a few mistakes and missed a couple of minor rules. Ended on GT 4 as the USSR played Missile Envy as the Headline card after US lowered DEFCON to 2 with his Headline card (a 2 vs 2 value with US going first on Headline ties). As it happened, the best US card was a '4', We Will Bury You, which sadly caused the USSR to blow up the world. I hate it when that happens. Now I have to go buy the d*** game.

After many games, there are several items I like about this game. 
The way is using playing for operations or events. Very much like the way opponents events happen whenever you use an opponents card for operation points. 
Timing and bluffing are important as you try to figure out your opponents plans, while masking your own. 
Include Space race and other victory point events you have a rich game with a lot of options for your play. 
Finally it feels that is does capture some of the flavor of the cold war.

One of the best theme game that I have. The tension and strategy is at a high level troughout the game. You realy have to manage your play to take advantage of the cards where the event is not in you favor. Every move is a difficult decision. You realy feel the tension in this game has you were at the head of a superpower. Only down note: the material. The board is a light carton that doesn't sit flat on the table and the scoring chips are realy small. The cards are super.

Un des meilleurs jeu √† th√®me que je poss√®de. La strategie et la tension sont √† un niveau √©lev√© tout au long de la partie. Vous devez g√©rer vos cartes dont les √©v√©nements ne sont pas en votre faveur de fa√ßon √† limiter les dommages. Chaque coup repr√©sente une d√©cision difficile. Vous sentez la tension tout au long de la partie comme si vous √©tiez √† la t√™te d'une super-puissance. Seule petite note n√©gative. Le plateau est fait d'un carton l√©ger qui, une fois d√©pli√©, ne repose pas √† plat sur la table de jeu. Les cartes par contre sont tr√®s bien faites.

RATING: 6
I have only played via iPad with the app but ultimately I don't think this game is for me. I'm quite willing to give it a few more chances but thus far I'm not a big fan. The game is very complex and much of the early games is spent reading cards and trying to understand what they do. This also makes it very hard to plan ahead strategy wise since I don't know what cards are in the deck. Repeated plays may help in this regard, but that does not make for a very inviting game for the first few plays. 

But even without all that, the game just wasn't that interesting to me. I think it's quite smart and can see the appeal for some. But it seems to require far too much study and practice to get competent for me to ever want to spend that many hours just to get to a point where I may be able to enjoy it. As is currently I feel hopelessly lost on what to do and with all the competing systems and mechanics it doesn't seem streamlined or intuitive to me. Taken together, this game isn't one I'm rushing out to play.

Excellent 2-player strategy game. A bit on the long side 4-5 hours the first few times you play. It helps to get to know the cards, especially the scoring cards and during what phases of the game they come into play.

One minor complaint which is unrelated to the game mechanics is the board ergonomics. I with the action round tracker was placed at the bottom of the game board as the marker on this track needs to be adjusted every time a player takes an action. Reaching across the board a minimum of 67 times in a game is a pain.

RATING: 4
Having played the game, I understand WHY people find this game interesting, I really do. However it is an excruciating example of everything I hate in board games that I hate. First off to play well, you really have to understand the entire game and know how the cards break down into positive and negative actions and how to play off them the best which means a lot of memorization which is an instant way to turn me off a game. I like the exploration of a game and the joy of that rather than feeling like I have to do homework and memorize strategies. Secondly it is far too deck driven as in its only real mechanic and literally no way to mitigate bad hands whatsoever. You may get lucky on a hand or two over the game but my experience was ok here's one card that helps you and 7 that do nothing but make victory assured for the other player. No mitigation at all and they just seemed to be matching up with exactly how my opponent was playing. It's the same reason I hate Pandemic and that one has TWO decks that can easily cost you the game no matter how much planning and problem solving you do. So if I were not able to see the game underneath what personally turns me off in a game this would easily be a one but I can see its value to a percentage of gamers out there so it in all honesty deserves the 4.

Deep, engaging, challenging, but not too complex. There's a lot going on between the players that is left unsaid and you're sometimes not sure what is motivating a move by the other player. You may waste effort countering a move that is a distraction. Very much an action / reaction type play experience. I'm not a big fan of two player games because I like the human dynamics in game play, but this is a great two player game (and I don't think there are many that qualify). I would love to see a 3-5 player game with similar mechanics.

RATING: 6.5
Played for the first time recently.  NOTE: THIS IS NOT A WARGAME!  Anyway the game could rise with additional plays.  I plan to play it a few times to give the game a true rating.

Well I have improved the rating of this game to 7 from 6.  I think the game is good.  However, it is a little too Euro for me.  It is very difficult to deal a crushing blow to your opponent.  Also, as with many CDGs you need to know the cards to become a decent player.  I do not know if I like that about this game. Or the other games.  The difference is though that some of the cards seem too quirky.  Oh well.  I will play again.

I returned it to 6.  

10/24/2012: Well, I played again and improved to 6.5.  It is a good game.  You need to understand it as a game.  It can be a bit frustrating with the six-sided die rolls, but once you understand the rules, the game goes pretty quickly. [6.5]

Update: This is one of those games that I admire but have no desire to play again. I simply don't like the idea that in order for me to play well, I have to know the deck.

Also, I think I'm too stupid for the game. All the methods to acquire influence in a country I simply do not fully comprehend.

As for issue [1]: I find the scoring mechanic quite thematic. The idea that you are obliged to score for one area on the map simply because you got dealt the scoring card corresponds well to the paranoia and pointlessness of the Cold War.

=====

The most important thing for me when it comes to war games is theme, and I think it fails for the following reasons:

[1] Scoring. I don't know much about the Cold War or the goals of its main participants, but they could've found a more thematic scoring mechanic other than area majority. Worse is how these scoring rounds are triggered. If you are dealt a scoring card, you must score a particular region during that round. So you're thinking how to best play the cards in your hand to make the most of that scoring card. However, because scoring in this manner is an essential part to winning this game, all you are thinking about is making points -- you totally lose sight of the theme, which makes TS feel "gamey."

[2] The card driven war game format. In a typical war game, all significant actions are mapped to a unique mechanism. For example: moving units, you move your counter on the board; battle, you roll dice. Also, the number of possible actions are quite limited. Move, attack, reinforce, and build. Here, the CDW mechanism allows the designer to add almost any historical event to a game. The problem is that regardless of event, you're basically doing the same thing: draw a card, add/remove an influence marker, etc. What happens is that no one bothers to read the name of the event. Instead, players read the consequences of each event.

[3] The mechanisms for coups and realignment don't feel very elegant in relation to all the other mechanisms in the game. You're very restricted in your actions in terms of the kinds of events each card features and how you add influence markers on the board. But with coups and realignments, you can do them almost anywhere on the board.

Despite these glaring flaws, I'm still willing to play this game again. The game moves quickly, and it's easy for me to find willing opponents.

RATING: 9.8
Twilight Struggle is incredibly well designed.  The deep layers of strategy are implemented with only cards, influence markers, and dice.  In fact, this game is far and away the most strategic game that incorporates dice that I have ever seen.  They add the perfect amount of uncertainty to the world-scale game of influence, striking a perfect balance of fortune - but fortune that can be weighted one direction or the other.  

Also impressive is the deep and understated balance this game delivers through the randomness of its elements.  The shuffled cards, much like the previously mentioned die rolls, are not nearly the game-swinging implements of other games. The dual op point or action mechanic inherent in the cards creates a nice tension of which ability to use vs. what helps my opponent the least, but the understated mechanic that really swings the randomness back toward strategy is the fact that once a player-aligned ability is used on a card, it is removed from play.  The implication is that even if you happen to draw a handful of cards that help your opponent, you have the ability to control when they are played and removed, which leaves the deck more heavily stocked with cards that help you - ready to swing the game back in your favor!

Overall, this is truly the most deeply strategic game I've ever played, and each play carries the weight of history with it.  It is a very rewarding game to win and a profound learning experience when you lose.  Also interesting is the fact that I have learned far more about the Cold War and its political intricacies through playing this game - a first for me.

Truly the only downsides to this game are the playing time and the fact that it is only a two player game.  It is long (at least 2 - 3 hours), and if your play group is larger than yourself and a friend, then this game is not an option.  

To conclude, I very highly recommend adding this game to any collection.  Our group is usually 4 - 6, but on the occasions that only one other person is available to play, this is the game we most often break out.  There is a reason it's number 1, and it is a genuinely rewarding experience.

TS is an interesting game to be sure, and once mastered can be an extremely tactical beast... but ONLY once both players have reached the point of having memorized the effects and potential timing of every single shuffled card in the game.
If you haven't done so, then TS is just going to feel completely arbitrary, random, and devoid of strategy.

It really feels like someone took a methodical and intense area control game that requires expert planning and foresight, and stapled Fluxx on top of it.    
Multiple turns of careful containment and thoughtful maneuvering on the board are routinely made pointless by randomly drawn cards that massively swing the game state without player input.   The only meaningful counter-play is to just straight up memorize every card in the deck and attempt to plan for the deck's unpredictable nonsense.

After many plays vs an equaly skilled player i have to say that there is lots of luck involved.
I had the board pretty much under control in 4 games in a row. But i just wasn#t able to get the right scoring cards at the right time. So i lost 4 times with an superior board position.

This really frustaretd my leately.

I must admit that I was a late comer to Twilight Struggle. I had the Deluxe Edition and played it a couple of times, but I wasn't able to "get" it. Sometimes it happens.

Then, after almost one year, I played TS again with a passionate friend, and somehow this time things "clicked". I understood both the spirit and the beauty of the game. 

Since then I didn't play a lot of games - maybe a dozen - but the variety of strategies, variables, lucky breaks and dire happenings... and not to mention how TS shows how the Cold War was a big Poker game infused with paranoia... well, I can see myself playing both the tabletop version and the digital one for the foreseeable future.

A side note. Some gamers whine about the "luck" factor. IMHO, that's the very point: the "illusion of control". Many people involved in the Cuban Missile Crisis later testified how sheer luck was a key element in preventing a thermo-nuclear war (among them, Robert McNamara). A sobering thought from one of the best games I ever played.

Capolavoro della GMT Games e uno dei migliori "card-driven" mai realizzati. Gran bel gioco dalla ambientazione fantastica in grado di ricreare perfettamente il clima della guerra fredda tra USA e URSS. Le tensioni sono palpabili ad ogni pesca delle carte associate ad un evento, poi via con Eventi, Influenze, Colpi di Stato, Corsa allo Spazio e tenendo sempre d'occhio lo stato del DEFCON. Tantissima tattica e strategia. Il gioco √® inizialmente molto difficile per gli americani nella prima fase e pi√π difficile per i sovietici nella seconda. Per questo motivo, un consiglio, se giocate con un nuovo giocatore, lasciate a lui l'URSS. Abbastanza scacchistico, nonostante i dadi, con una presenza aleatoria marginale. Una sfida intensissima per due giocatori che si conoscono bene e che vogliono impegnarsi per almeno tre ore incollati alla partita con costante febbrile eccitazione. Un plauso agli autori che hanno dato vita ad un giocone... fedelissimo al contesto storico di riferimento, con uno scenario su cui si gioca: il Mondo (da spartirsi)! Peccato che un gioco cos√¨ ben fatto sia solo per due giocatori. International Gamers Award for 2-Player... 2006.

RATING: 10
I love it, for many reasons.

First of all, it's deep, but not complicated. The rules are quite straightforward really, but the gameplay... wow, there's a bit to think about here! One of the games that are (I know, it's cliche at this point) "easy to learn, hard to master". I don't play it often enough (it's time consuming, which is the only thing I hate, for personal reasons mostly [kids etc.]), but after each game, I know very well that there were dozens of things I could have done better. And that's why you want to play it again and again - to hone your skills, try different approach and so on. 

"Twilight Struggle" is the reason I fell in love in CDGs. While it can feel random at times, there are many ways to mitigate bad luck and just wait for a good hand to counterattack. And my god, is it thematic! A good lesson in history too, and a game that made me appreciate historical themes.

An utterly sensational game. The tension, the thrill of a big coup, the bluffing, the management of the military ops, the space race - it works extremely well.

I like one deck CDG's like this (though it has three phases) and Wilderness War. Both have similar time frames, card decks and complexity levels. A big hit for euro gamers and those looking for low end war games. Who knew the Cold War could be so much fun? Easy to learn, but entry level is difficult as knowing the deck is a BIG advantage. Expect a few early exits, but don't worry too much.

Sat down with another experienced gamer and tried to learn this one.  I lost due to a triggered nuclear war with a couple rounds to go.  It is impossibly long-winded, too driven by dice rolls, and requires an opponent at the same level as you.

There are too many other games out there (two-player included) that can provide depth and enjoyment, and you could play 2-3 of them in the time it takes to try and get through this one.

The best card-driven two-player game I've ever played, GMT Games' Twilight Struggle is set during the Cold War Era pitting the USSR vs. the USA. Great strategic depth and infinite replay value, even for veterans. I own the 2010 Deluxe Edition with the mounted map board.

RATING: 9
I'm actually upping the rating on this one after playing it more and more - probably the first time I've done this. I just love how the game emulates cold war and the whole brinkmanship of the era - even up to actual moments in the game where you manouver around defcons, try to figure out of the opponent is just bluffing or actually doing something soon - the constant tug of war between action and reaction.

Sure, it's most enjoyed with an overall knowledge of the cold war (especially the early stages and how it was a global conflict instead of just about the berlin wall) and for sure it requires a few games under your belt until you can truly start 'playing' it, but that "easy to learn, hard to master" is true for other great games as well. Sure, it's a little opaque for beginners and that creates the hurdle, since you need to persevere through the first couple of games to grow a bit of skin, but after that you'll either love it or hate it :)

From 2009: I've played this about four times, and have liked it better each time.  I was initially off put by the poor components.  I was also surprised at how apparent the "right" play seemed and how unbalanced the card set seems.  Maybe I just don't understand the US strategy yet, but the Soviets have won 3 of the 4 plays, and this looks like it will be close to the ongoing story.  Given that it takes about 2 hours to play, it is unlikely to get many sessions where we change sides and play again.  I think it would be improved with either unequal victory conditions, or a more balanced card set.  Still, it has very interesting game play, great use of an intriguing theme, and it is deep enough that it will be replayed often.  From 2017:  OK, I get it.  now one of my favorite games.  A close game can be a tense, epic 3 to 4 hour battle, but then again, it can be a 45 minute blitzkrieg.  Always willing to give this one a go, and one of the best 2 person games I have ever played.

RATING: 10
What a game. The game is really about the cards you play. The cards allow you to do certain events, do certain moves or you can toss them if you don't like them. The game is pretty tense as you go back and forth trying to do your plans as you foil your opponents. Unlike Labyrinth, the game is easier to learn and teach. The game can take a long time though and won't be easy for a new player to get. Knowing what cards are in the game is a huge advantage to have. This is a game I really want to play, but I doubt I'll be able to do so. The board and box art are very, very cool. The big, broad colors show a sense of urgency and seriousness - reminiscent of that time period, and strangely enough, relevant today.

I still don't think that I've played Twilight Struggle enough to comment on it properly. I love that the cards have multiple uses.  Most of all, I love the work with what you've got aspect of Twilight Struggle.  I've been on the look out for a game like Pinochle that you start with a bunch of something (cards, resources whatever), and as the game progresses, you've got less and less until you are finally forced to spend everything. Twilight Struggle is like incredibly deep, themed Pinochle with area control.  Each time I play a card, I wonder what my opponent will do in response.  Does he have something to counter that?  Would it have been better to play something else sooner?  All of these questions are going to keep me playing Twilight Struggle for a long time.

Definitely an epic game. This fell a little flat for me.  I think the main reason is that I have zero interest in the cold war. I was never sure if I should be playing my cards as events or use the influence. I can see my rating go up after a few plays. I've read that it doesn't become truly great until after you are familiar with the cards and know what to look for. Time will tell.

How in the world is this rated number one?

Gameplay is ridiculously inelegant and tile placement is tedious.  

The event cards are rather interesting...  I lived through all of it...  but the thrill is gone once you've read them.   

"Will this ever end?"  

I sold my copy after two plays.  Thankfully a lot of the mechanics of the thing has left my consciousness.

RATING: 10
+excelent and strong theme that will take you right in the middle of the Cold War
+number of winning options and posibilities 
+easy general rules with nice cheat sheets
+a lot of thinking with little to none wating for other player

-kind of too random and snowballing space race track for a heavy 2-player strategy game
-very low quality of third polish edition (don't know about any other versions but this rly was a great con to this one for me)



Truly outstanding game. The only 2 things that made me not to give it a 10.  
First thing not rly connected to the game itself, terrible quality of polish third edition, board is not flat after deploying and cards are not good at all taking into account mechanic that makes you use some cards 10 times more than others. Sleves are a must.
The other thing is a small thing with a gameplay, when you are behind in space race at the very beggining and you don't get the only card that may help you soon, you are doomed to loose like 6-8 points from an unlucky roll at the very beggining. It's not a huge deal but still the one thing in my opnion near perfect gameplay.

Update:
After ~10 more games i think the space race is not as important as i though, however wars and dice rolls in general seems to be too random for my taste. the difference between 1 and 6 is huge. 1-you wasted your turn, 6-you have taken control over a country with stability 2. The fact that after planing and trying to outmind your opponent you have to say "YOLO" lets roll this, and you have no idea what will happen is kind of out of place for me. 

I am just neatpicking here. Game is great. I just wish it was perfect.

Not sure I'm a big fan of CDG's like this yet.  I will have to try a few more times to confirm.

Things I don't like:

2) Cards - strategy is based on the cards and if you don't know the deck well then it is impossible to play well.

A very well-themed game.  Fun, interesting, and competitive throughout.  A bit long and has a few awkward victory scenarios, but overall, quite enjoyable.  I would have liked to have had a few more cards in my hand to give me greater flexibility, but it made for interesting situations.  I much prefer 1960's speed, elegance, and replayability.

RATING: 8
A classic outshined by its more streamlined "successor" (1960: The Making of the President). Having played both in the inversed order of their year of release, it's clear to me that 1960 takes advantage of Twilight Struggle's great design to bring it to an even higher level of achievement: first, 1960 is a faster game; second, while much of TS complexity revolves around memorizing the entire deck and knowing all the intricacies of card interrelations, 1960's goes to a different direction, bringing difficult decisions from an amazing card design (with so much information crammed in) that makes TS cards seem dull in comparision; third, the brilliant compensation mechanic of the "rest cubes". As a Cold War simulation, however, there's none better than TS.

Very involved 2P game set in the cold war.  Kinda like Risk on steroids (but it's card driven control of areas, rather than dice battling for domination of areas).  There are 10 turns...each turn you get a hand of ~8 cards and take turns playing the cards as you try to secure control of various regions of the world.  The scoring cards are shuffled into the deck so you don't know when you will be required to score various regions of the globe.  Nice theme/history contained in the game.

Some frustration as it feels most of the game you are trying to minimize the damage of 'bad' cards in your hand.  You can use each card for the special historical power printed on the card, or just use it to get action points to directly increase your influence on the board, or reduce your opponent's influence.

Long game!

I would like this game much less if Jeremy and JP didn't enjoy it and play it often. That said, the card driven mechanic is approachable and, dare I say it, "fun". Still, at the end of the day a 1 ops card is just not as good as a 3 ops card and drawing a hand full of them (or worse, a hand full of scoring cards) pretty much screws you over.

also, its full of dice rolling. never a good sign for balancing

I had thought that I would really like this one but it is 'meh' for me.

One thing I don't like is the "This card I have to play helps the other guy" dynamic.  Yes it is an original design (which I appreciate), but too often I end up with a hand of cards and I don't want to do anything.

Another thing that turns me off a tiny amount is I never believed the domino theory of geopolitics.

I can understand how people like this game - it's just not for me.  This is the kind of game that you are going to need to invest in the entirety of the game to get the full experience.  You will need to memorize each card.  You are going to need to understand how everything fits together.

To build a strategy in this game you are going to need to have realizations like: "Ok, I see that X1-CARD hasn't been played yet, so I know X2-REGION is getting scored soon.  I need to play X3-CARD to ensure..."

I'm sure the game is well balanced.  I'm sure it has a depth of strategy that allows for repeated game play.  I'm sure it's every bit as fun as people say it is once you grok the system.  I'm just not even remotely interested in devoting that much of my attention to a single game (or game system).

If it wasn't for the doubtful "historical" outcome of some game situations the game would have gotten a 10+. I have very seldomly enjoyed an easy game so much. Beware, easy but not dumb! The possible paths to victory are numerous and the cards can totally ruin your strategy that worked so fine last time ;-).

Excellent game. There is a lot of tension and hard decisions for each player. I think that the US player has a slight edge; if s(he) can avoid a knockout in the first few turns, the Late War deck has many advantages. Not a simulation really, but TS does give you some flavor.

RATING: 5
Very big disappointment for me. I gave this game two tries, but both the randomness and the amount of reading you have to do made me not enjoy this game. One central aspect of avoiding playing cards from which your opponent benefits more than you, also made me feel miserably through most of the game. I also cannot see how interesting gameplay should emerge from this.

For a card driven 2-player game with dice based conflict resolution which takes quite some time to play, I would always prefer War of the Ring. To me there  is no other example of two games occupying the same niche and one beating the other so clearly.

RATING: 9.5
A superlative card-driven area control game that replicates the Cold War between the US and USSR from 1945-1989.

The game is full of tough, agnonising choices that often has my head in my hands trying to figure out how to analyse, deal with, and respond to multiple theatres, multiple threats, and how best to utilise my cards to resolve all the above.

The cherry on top is Playdek's app implementation on Steam, iOS and Android: from the early 80s electronic theme music, to the historical news-reels and soundbites during each round, and how slick and easy the UI makes playing the game. 

It is testament to the game that the cardboard version is on my 'Want to Buy' list.

Card driven play to apply and remove influence in scoring regions, with a variety of "event" cards to add some spice. However, a number of subtle restrictions (e.g. when and where coups may be attempted), subplots/subgames (such as the space race), and ingenious balancing rules (realignment, the military track, DEFCON levels) give players much more to think about. A game of area control, positioning, timing, strategy and counterstrategy. A player can quickly escalate the game into a military conflict to detract from his opponent's strategy or mitigate luck of the draw.. A game of action and reaction, where dedication to a long term strategy could just as easily lose you the game as win it. The theme is fully immersive and integrated into the mechanics.

I enjoy the political theme of Twilight Struggle. The game is smooth and plays relatively quick. There is an element of luck with the single die roll and the draw of the cards that sometimes overcomes the best of strategies. However, these shortcomings are minor and do not distract from the overall enjoyment of the game much.

enjoying this game.   Its a card game that has conflict but doesn't feel like nasty conflict...so far.  Lots of thought can happen if you get the right combo of cards.  The Space race roll can be unforgiving too. Very well thought out game with lots of historic information.  Lots of Strategy but can be a bit foiled by luck of the draw and bad die rolls.  Space Race doesn't seem to play much of a factor but it can be good to get rid of cards.  Great concept in game play that feels epic however, I'm just not sure it's that fun.  Can feel a bit more like work and analysis paralysis can really slow this long game down especially with newer players.

Tense and highly enjoyable area influence game with excellent theme. Card-draws and events give the design tremendous replayability. By half-way through our first game, we didn't have to open the rulebook anymore. Fair amount of luck, but that's tolerable in a 3 hour game.

Played through the "Early War" with Pearson and enjoyed it.  Can't really rate it though, since I didn't even finish the whole game.  Similar, of course, to 1960 (which I love).  Probably better because no over-powered issues track like 1960.

I am firmly convinced of a noticeable Soviet bias in the game.  That said, it's a damn fine game, that is very fun.  Winning with the US is one of the most satisfying gaming experiences that I have found.  Of course, I've played the game nearly 60 times, so what else did you expect me to say?  Also, thanks should be given to Bruce Wigdor for his awesome virtual face-to-face module at wargameroom.com.  I've probably played at least 2/3 of my games that way.

EXCELLENT! I have the newly published 2nd Edition. Nice improvement of the control markers and the HEAVY CARDBOARD box. This game has a lot of dice-rolling, but it requires good judgment and decision nonetheless. The theme is well represented over the three "stages" of the COLD WAR, and gives you many strategic options every turn. You will be overwhelmed with all of the tasks you need to accomplish, but you must focus on the immediate goals at hand, and respond to your opponents actions. Even when you have a bad game, it's still enjoyable to play.

Brilliant game well worth the time it takes to play (4-4.5 hours for my first two plays) and its high ranking.  I got creamed in my first game but by game 2 had a much better understanding of the mechanics and the game ebbed and flowed to quite a tense conclusion.  Highly thematic.  The cards very cleverly capture the key events of the era and abstract them into game play.

Rating after first complete game.  
I really wanted to like this game more than the first completed game left me feeling.  It is after all number 1 on BGG.  It could well be, all the intricacies and brinkmanship evolve through multiple plays.
If both players were not novices, i'm sure the experience would have been a harsh learning curve and expect my rating to change the more chance I get to play.
Looking forward to playing this again soon.

RATING: 6.2
I have played this game 11 times.

This game does not deserve to be
rated #1 or anywhere even remotely close
to it.

As a GMT production it has been very
heavily over-hyped by a largely US 
audience.

The physical production of this game 
was extremely poor with warped map
and flimsy box.

The artwork was passible but not better
than normal.

Game play tends to be programmed by
the cards and thus is less subject to 
player skill/choice as the vast majority 
of these cards will definitely occur. (And
player choice can usually do little to 
modify the results of cards being played.)

However, the most significant historical
events which are the most important to 
include in any historically accurate game 
are the Few Cards which are most likely 
to remain tucked away by the opponent
to prevent enemy use.

The game also lacks historical accuracy 
in having China Flip Flop back and forth 
Irrationally between the 2 sides; as if they
were a confused puppet in a bipolar world
instead of being a power in their own right.

The War in Vietnam also is underrepresented in
the extreme and is inaccurately portrayed as a
minor episode which the Americans can Easily
Win just by allocating a few more points to.
The dedication of this small country, absorbing
a massive US attack, defeating the US and 
Gaining Liberty for its country are no where to
be seen. The trite and wishful treatment given here in this game is completely inaccurate historically
and devoid of any Reality.

Finally the game seems to lack play balance
as the Soviets seem to have a significant
advantage.

While I do consider this to be a reasonable
Game it is not a great game nor is it an accurate
Historical one.

When one gets beyond all of the American hype
And the hype from GMT expect a solid but NOT 
an Outstanding game.

A modern classic. My wife and I have learned and played together for years, and we still love playing on a Saturday morning over cups of coffee.

This is an amazing game. Rules are long and tricky to get right at the start. But once you do - you have an absolute cracker of a game on your hands.

The game is deliberately unbalanced to the point of being very nicely balanced! USSR holding an advantage in the early game, but this swings to the US the longer the game goes on. 

Games can take a while, but I never turn down an opportunity to play.

One of my very favorite games!


23/11
I've taken the time to read a few of the negative comments about the game - to find out what people don't like about it. I'd like to address a couple of them.

1. Length - yes, it is a long game. Even a game where you steamroll your opponent, you will still probably be playing at least an hour. However, there are people who like a longer game. I feel I get more invested in a game that takes some time to play. And a victory or defeat means something. 

2. 2 player only. - Um, yes - it's a 2 player game. It says it on the box. Why mark it down for being "only 2 player"? Do people mark Solitaire down for being "only 1 player"?

3. You roll dice, the game is just luck. - You can get "unlucky" with the cards you draw and you can get unlucky when with dice when you go for that critical attack. I played a game online, where I felt that the dice were always screwing me and my opponent was always getting what he needed. In the end, my dice rolls averaged 3.6 and his 3.5 - my dice rolls were better, but both were pretty much average. We all remember when things go badly and forget when they go well. With dice in this game - I play this game hoping for the best, but preparing for the worst.

4. Just draw for killer card combination and win - This is the real kicker for me. Yes, there are some cards which are quite harsh on the other player. But there are ways around just about everything. The biggest strategy point in this game is when you have a horrible opponent card. Most people just try to space them, but this can be a mistake as they'll come back later. If you can play your opponent's card at a time of your choosing where you can minimise/eliminate the damage - then the card is gone forever! Likewise, prepare for similar cards your opponent is holding (always keep a 3+ strength card in hand until late in your turn as US). Often in this game, all your choices of cards to play might seem to be bad - but that means your opponent probably has similar nasty decisions to make holding "your" cards.

Overall - this won't be a game for everyone. For me, it is an incredibly deep, strategic and well balanced game. As I basically mentioned, I love it!

This game is very thematic and at times playing the USSR I found myself wanting to say "Nyet Nyet" when I was not happy with a USA move.

The map and components are ok, game has some dice rolling when you perform coups whilst adding some randomness does not detract completely from game. Game takes too long for what it delivers and can be a little fiddly with all the influence counters. I will play this game again but will not be purchasing a copy.

Notwithstanding, there is no way this game should be number one as there are loads of other games about.

Although I enjoy a two player CDG like Hannibal, TS has more appeal because of the period it is set in. In addition, the game works more fluently since there are no moving parts. This makes sure that the overview works better and faster play is a result.

[COLOR=#00CC99]CO[/COLOR] This was one of the first games we ever bought. Which was big mistake, because we weren't used to play complicated games and we were completely lost at this mammoths rules. The more my boyfriend was talking about this eagerly and I was starting loking to forward to play it, the more we were disappointed when we actually played it for the first time. We turned the game down for a long time...And then, after becoming more experienced, we discovered a really good strategy game we like to play when have whole free evening (seriously, we never played it for less than three hours).

Only thing that bothers me is when playing for Russia, you have to win till fifth turn, then in game appear cards which give advantage to U.S. (I once lost 18 hardly gained points in just one turn - along with other twenty needed for my opponent to win :D).

Excellent two-player game. It has very good replay value, but the learning curve can be a little steep. The rules are simple, but how to translate that into how to play the game is not obvious. Wide-open decision tree, too, so people who are prone to taking a long time are more likely to.

However, definitely worth getting for me. When teaching new players, go easy on them, or else they may never show up again :)

Once I went to visit my best college buddy Dave when he was just getting out of this shitty divorce. I came out during my spring break for a week to visit him, in his crappy sad divorced-dad apartment, with boxes full of his crap that he'd didn't have the heart to unpack, an inflatable bed, and an upturned cardboard box for a dining room table. The place stank of despair. I showed up with no plans and a copy of Twilight Struggle, which I'd never played, in my suitcase. He thought it was his duty to "show me New York", and we kept trying to do touristy, but every day, we'd just stop at some point, look at each other, and say, "You wanna go back and just play Twilight Struggle?" 

We played game after game on his kitchen floor, in his empty kitchen, in that sad dreary apartment, and playing this game was the first time I'd seen him happy in about a year.

Massive dissappointment. Had very high hopes for this. Played it twioce with 2nd game lasting 6hours despite a 7th turn win. It does feel very random but this isnt the problem...the problem is it feels dull. Despite the obvious theming it feels like you're just addong red and blue counters to spaces just before they are scored...the timing of which is semi-random. The fact that u pretty much have to play all the cards in your hand removes any tactical decisions and instead of the many tension-filled fraught decisions i was hoping for u just get this sense of dull inevitability. Add to all this the fact its alleged to be bias in favour of 1 side and i fail to see the appeal of this game at all. I would try and recommend an alternative but i dont know of 1 so if anyone does please let me know! i would love to find a long 2pl immersive game that feels like you've done something constructive with your time but this isnt it

I bought this game because it has consistently been rated very high on the BGG. I waited till I have had a few plays under my belt before rating it myself.

Highly recommend as a game to fit this time period, as well as for ease of play and enjoyment overall.

Fast playing wargame of the Cold War that is a well balanced mix of using operations points for expansion/removal of influence markers and the event effects--the forced use of an opponent's event works well to provide the necessary tension.

Although the cards cover most of the events/situations of the period, a few events could have been present:  building of the Berlin Wall (there is Reagan's "Tear Down this Wall"), "Ich bin ein Berliner", Watergate, "The Premier has a cold", Challenger Disaster, Eastern European Crackdown (on Hungary or Czechoslavakia), Stagflation, etc.

I've loving it so far.  It has all the delicious agony, bluff, and flavor of a card-driven wargame with much less weight (save perhaps for We the People).  I have seen both the USSR and the US win in 3 plays, so I not so concerned about play balance.

One feature I really like is that playing the other guy's event card for ops points triggers his event -- and it is hard to avoid playing a card.  That ensures that lots of events will happen, which is a big reason I play CDWs.

RATING: 6
 This is a difficult game to asses. The game mechanics are very simple, basically an area control eurogame (very much like El Grande) with wargame components. It's also a bit longer than other eurogames of similar complexity. The theme is terrific, no doubt, even with didactic value. 

 The main mechanics: influence placement and events plays often very smoothly, but unfortunately, the rest doesn't and seems pasted, like realignments (rarely played) and the space race (lame and completely luck based and disconnected from the rest). I enjoyed it, because of the theme, and the fun that comes from discovering the deck and seeing how the game events unroll. But, you must accept the fact that the luck component in the game is huge (often decisive), heavily imbalanced (the USSR have substantial advantage) and where most of the skill in the game comes from the deck knowledge and card counting.

 I think of it as an OK game, if only because the theme, enjoyable (if you can live with the luck factor) until you know the events, but from that onwards I cannot see very much play. Similar games, as El Grande are far better designed, more intense and balanced.

This game is amazing! I don¬¥t get tired of playing it. One of the best boardgames I¬¥ve played EVER! You maybe will love it or hate it, so... yes: it¬¥s balanced!  :-D  It¬¥s pure tension at every turn! Its artwork is not so good, but it fits with theme, and its graphic design works because is crystal clear. For me, this is one of the best two-player board game in the market. The digital App by Playdek is very well done, and I use to play it on my PC (I recommend it if you like this game).

after 1st play - Lost all the way... I can see why this game has such a high Rating, lots of details, a History lesson. I enjoyed the time while I was playing, and I know it takes a lot of plays to become good at it, I think it deserves the time and effort.
I'll rate this game an 8, but it will go up with experience, I'm sure of that.

RATING: 8
The Cold War with all it's historical events in a complex startegic game with amazingly simple rules.

The action has its heart in the card deck which forces players to play events even when harmful to them. However, clever hand management can delay or reduce those events.

In addition to seeking direct political control of the worlds regions, players seek to avoid plunging to avoid Defcon 1 while being forced to foment military clashes. Brinksmanship is the name of the game.

I like this game a lot. Very deep. There is a bit of an element of luck with cards drawn and dice rolled, which adds some frustration to me. Also, the wording of the written rules about domination in the most recent printing (as of 2016) is incorrect and was confusing until I got clarification on BGG forums. Otherwise, I love games that are so deep that they take many plays to grasp that many different strategic options. Highly recommended!

Simply the most engaging game that I've played maybe ever.  Great theme & mechanics.  Updated 2-12-10, Just played this for the first time in 2 years.  Don't know why it has been so long.  Rules so beautifully simple that playing again was just like riding a bike.  Told myself that I would just take this game lightly and not let it get intense.  By the 4th turn, both my opponent and I were completely engrossed.  There's no playing this game lightly.  It reaches out and grabs you once you get going.  I would give it an 11 or 12 if it were possible.

I have really enjoyed the two partial games of this I have played and I can see why it is rated so highly.  Withholding rating until at least one full play has been completed but as a 2-player only and a wife who refuses, I don't know when that will be.

Edited 4/20/2013: Finally got a few complete plays in with Sean.  We both like it a lot.  However, it is definitely not my most favorite game.  I would rate it in the top 10 but certainly not as number 1.

RATING: 10
After my very first play (+7hrs) my impressions are: great theme, enjoyable to play, will require more sessions to become familiar with the cards. The only slight criticism I have is that it feels odd--not wrong--to roll dice when most of the game is highly strategic.

RATING: 7.5
12-08-2015. Rated after 1 play. Going into a game expecting a lot from "the best game" on BGG is probably stupid, but hey.

In TS you play cards, until one of a few victory conditions trigger. Either USSR or USA controls Europe during scoring, gets 20 VPs or at the end of round 10 via scoring.

You achieve this by playing cards from a shared deck of cards, there are USSR, USA or shared cards. Each turn, you play 6 or 7 cards. First, in the headline phase you play a card for its event. Then, you are allowed to play cards for the printed event OR for operation points. With operation points you can add influence tokens in countries, if you ever have the majority in an area and exceed the 'treshold' and the treshold + your opponents influence you 'control' that area. 
A lot of cards also allow you to play events, often these allow you to remove influence or add influence in specific regions. If you ever play a card for operation points that is from your opponent's faction, then your opponent gets to play that event.

I mean, I like TS. It's not broken or problematic or in anyway less than 'good'. I just feel it's disappointing, the components are poor, the artwork on the cards is.. just meh, the theme is meh. I think I'd enjoy the system more with a more interesting setting.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I can see why this is so popular, but I was quite a bit underwhelmed after wanting to try it for so long based on its BGG rating. My opinion is after only 1 play, so take it with a large grain of salt, and I would be willing to try it again, but no great interest to do so.

It is a good mix of Euro and wargame mechanics, but my main issues were:
Game length - it's seems like playing 7 out of a hand of 8 cards each turn is excessive; trimming this down could have shortened the game significantly with the same epic feel.  

Lack of historical theme - Clearly the designers worked hard to put as much history into the cards as possible, but IMO there is not very much integration of theme and mechanics.  This was evident when most times we would not read the title of the card when playing it.  Most wargames are a much closer simulation of what happened, with a mixture of scripted actions and player decisions. After a good wargame, I want to go read about how the battle actually went historically to see how it differs from what happened.  Twilight Struggle does not really produce this narrative, since the game is just a string of events and operations, that only very loosely fit the normal timeline through the structure of the 3 section draw deck.  I kept wanting to see the alternative event occur a la Chrononauts - it would have been so cool if each event had 2 possibilities - one if played by US, alternative if played by USSR.
  
2 player area control with # tiles is pretty boring - ultimately the game is area control, with you vying for majority in each country.  # tiles are intrinsically less interesting than piles of cubes a la El Grande, and when it's just 2 players, it creates a tug of war where you add 2, I add 3, you take away 2, I take away 1.  That's an oversimplification - there's a lot more strategy over where and when you fight or cede control. We hated We the People, and while Twilight Struggle improves the area control play a lot, it wasn't enough to hold my interest.

At the end of the day, staring at the map for 3 hours just makes me want to play multiple games of Pandemic in the same time.  Same board (pretty much) but more thematic feel and tension.


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I don't understand the love this game gets.  I think that Labyrinth, 1960, and Hannibal are all superior.  Still a decent game, but feels too much like a "card game with a board" rather than a "board game with cards."
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
----------

After only 2 plays, I'm simply in awe of the depth of gameplay in this gem.  There are so many options and so many considerations that must be made every turn.  It can be overwhelming to first-time players, but I'd say that the first step to success is to learn the cards.

Due to the intense brain burn, this isn't a game I could play every day, but it's one that will continue to provide an amazing experience as I play it more.

This is my #5 game.

Played 5 full games in a short time, and have enjoyed this a lot. CCCP-US 3-2, with two of those as game-sessions for the memories. One with me as US back on my knees with CCCP on 19 three different times that I managed to get out of, and also an equal summit-roll with CCCP on 18, and my opponent rolled a 6, that I matched!!! And then I won with 4 points at the end-scoring :)

LOVE the theme of this game. It's great! In fact I am currently watching a 24 part documentary on the cold war and you can truly see how well the designers have translated real-world events into cards. Also has gotten me (even more) hooked on card driven games! Now to try Memoir '44..

--Nov2006-- (After two games.) Loads of period color, and surprisingly playable too.  One is at the mercy of the cards to a great degree, but there appears to be opportunity to survive the occasional bad hand.  Looks like it may have fairly good replayability.
--Dec2006-- I'm quite enjoying this.  Ask me again when I've got a 5 game losing streak, though...

Twilight Struggle is not a game for the casual gamer. This game requires an investment in time to memorize and or develop a system such as excel spread sheets in order to be competitive.  Yes this has been said many times before, but I'm stating it again because the new buyer, player needs to know that the number 1 rated game on BGG should not be rated number 1.  In my opinion, the top 10 rated games should be games that can be played by the casual/ family gamers.  After all, the game rating system is made to attract people to boardgaming.  Twilight Struggle is NOT one of this games!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Imagine the tension you get in something like Lost Cities, where you are constantly debating doing something that helps your opponent to do something you really want to do. Now, stretch that feeling over a grueling 3 hour+ session and you have Twilight Struggle. Simple ruleset, but somehow manages to capture the paranoia and tension of the Cold War era.

My original partner for this game is no longer around so I played this with someone new and destroyed them. This doesn't dampen my opinion of the game, but it did drive home the point that players should be of similar skill level.

Great game. Tense and atmospheric all the way.
I love the fact that all the good cards can only help you a bit and all the bad cards help you a little, it has a great balancing effect. You just have to use them to your best advantage in your overall strategy.
Constantly shifting situations keep on at the edge of your seat. You really have to keep tabs on your opponent. As a bonus the (2nd Ed. at least) rulebook has historical background for all the events in the game.
Even my SO is eager to play this (DISCLAIMER: She will also (among other games) play Arkham Horror and she loves Adv. Civ).
Highly recommended.

Tremendously fiddly, it takes forever, and the dice combat element seems like something I might have designed at age 12. The tug-of-war Adding Of Influence Chits is a puerile design mechanic.

It is embarrassing that this particular game sits bizarrely atop the rankings on our website, a strange fact which surely sells many copies of the game...to many naive, trusting buyers. I don't really know what to say about that, but I know that it doesn't make me feel good.

UPDATE: I've given this numerous tries now. It is an Ameritrash dice fest. Experienced players (I've only played with fellow amateurs) will surely beat the uninitiated, which is normally the sign of a good game. But in this case, I think it is mainly because they know the deck, and so can manipulate the timing of things. To those who think that this "skill" is what makes for an interesting board game encounter, I say "have at it." When two similarly experienced amateur players are pitted against each other, you have a four-hour affair that comes down to who rolls more "6s", and who draws the cards in the order that better helps them. That's the sort of nonsense that is utterly forgiveable--and even sometimes fun--in a thirty-minute game. But...

I've dropped my rating on this every single time I have played it. Enough is enough.

RATING: 9.6
A game that seems to achieve what it sets out to do. Very hard to find any faults, although (logical and understandable) rigid card group order seems to cause similar positions to come up repeatedly, unlike say 1960, where any card can come up at any stage of the game. Half the time we seem to be to & fro-ing in South America.

This game was, is, and will always be on the top of my geeklist. In general, a game is highlighted by either its theme or mechanic, but TS features BOTH! Thematically, it is played on the map of the world, presenting the history of the half century of cold war, which I am very fond of. Mechanically, the Card-drive system is one of my favorite game elements. This game strategic, well-balanced, immense in options, and, in one word, terrific! I give it a perfect ten and assure you this is never changed.

This is an absolutely phenomenal game.  So much intricacy and strategy involved, which I think is good.  I will always enjoy playing this game.  Unfortunately the fact that it takes over 3 hours to play (I've never been able to play a game under 4) knocks it down a notch in my book.  As a husband and dad, I rarely have 3-4 hours at a time to devote to playing a game.  And if I do, I probably want to play something other than a 2 player game.  So it is definitely worth playing, but I imagine I will only ever get to play it once or twice a year at most.

Stunning--simple rules that can easily be taught to an new player, and you can soon dive into a game; however, during the game there is a lot to think about. Excellent theme. 

There is great variety from game to game because the random appearance of the scoring cards means that the importance of each region changes from game to game; I don't understand the "scripted" criticism at all. The USA only seems disadvantaged at first; once you play more games, both superpowers will be winning regularly.

After some ten games of Twilight Struggle, a couple of things impress me. First of all, I'm amazed how well it implements not just the events of the Cold War, but also the emotions. There's a sense that you must mirror the other player because you just must, that's why. And you always feel like you're losing, even when you're well ahead. 

Secondly, this is a very complex game without being very complicated. By which I mean the game is challenging and nuanced, but not very rules-intensive. I know with my head how to play, but my experience is still green and raw. I love that I'll be able to play this one for years to come, and it'll keep revealing depths to me. Really a masterpiece of lean design and theme.

I have to admit that I don't really fancy CDG, and this game is no exception: My problem is that I really think that the choice between OPs and Events is totally gamey here ("So, do we launch the NATO or try a coup somewhere), specially when it comes down to cards management ("Comrade, let us activate the NATO now, so that it doesn't come to life later in the war")
I liked 1960 better because there I could somehow understand (or relate to) the OP/Event choices there.
[Besides: in TS you sometimes have the feeling that you are not really playing the game: the cards are]

Essentially, TS fails the "Simulation" test, which is my main interest in political games: might be a good game, but I'm looking for a good simulation.

What's there to say? Full of fascinating decisions, tough choices, and deep strategy, yet isn't overburdened with fiddly rules, and doesn't take a whole day to play. A masterpiece in elegant game design. Thematically excellent as well. The quintessential 2-player board game.

I had read a lot of history regarding the Cold War before playing this game and Twilight Struggle captures it perfectly; the promotion of ideals through deception, aid, posturing, armed struggle... it was a battle of minds and will that encompssed the globe.As in the real conflict there's a fine line to tread here; be too aggressive or weak in your stance and you will lose. As a side note, if you are studying the history of the Cold War then play this game. It will put you in the midst of it unlike no book ever could. Also watch the film Thirteen Days.

Played this once teamed up with someone else against the organizer of the Toronto Area Gamers meetup group. We won by going for a risky victory point jump in turn 6 (I think) after 2 rounds of horrible cards which caused our board position to decline pretty drastically and realizing that another scoring card would have put us in a position that would have been almost impossible to climb back from. I like that there are multiple win conditions but it took a while to understand all the turn possibilities.

RATING: 6
To make long things short, i love this game, but sadly i hate playing it. It can't be helped: i love the many moments of headbreaking tension that this game offers you, but after countless games i can't shrug my head off the deep certainty that most often that not this game is decided by drawing the best card at the best possible moment (being Destal, or Decol, or Grain Sales, or RS/P, or simply a scoring card), and, extensively, by having overall better hands with better cards than your opponent. By playing this game, you accept that you may invest two hours and more in trying to get the upper hand after a weak start, only to fail miserably to do so simply because cards does not swing in your way. Conversely, you may be on the brink of win or defeat, and then either you or your opponent will get all the most powerful or weakest Mid-War cards, which can singlehandedly fix or break even the most dire or best situation. This turn the game into basically something like "endure turn X hoping that turn Y you will get luckier", which is not the way one of the supposedly best games ever created should put you on. Such game should give it's players a more cohesive and rewarding way of planning a strategy, not just being a streak of tense moments that, yes, are interesting, engaging and all, but that you have to pay for by accepting that the game may be doomed from the start if you don't get better hands. Yes, you have to learn the basics to play to win, which are matured out of experience and by reading some guide. This is actually another weak point of this game: you can't possibly play it to have fun or to unwind or to try some fancy move, by doing so you just take useless risks that may undermine your shot at victory. Same story if you play with someone who is less experienced than you: either you give him an edge by playing softly, or you are doomed to win a game after another. I'll say that TS is one of the rare games that somehow become less enjoyable the more you play it, because more and more things becomes an auto-play and the great variety that the game seems to offers at a first glance simply disappear with experience. 
I strongly thing that the game could have been better with some additional mechanic, and sometimes i wonder what was the first draft game that JM and AG turned into TS because it was considered too long and slow.

As a final note about a long and still much debated charade, i don't really think that the game is broken in favor of the URSS unless the USA is given an uncoupable stronghold in Iran (which is considered the best "fix"). Again, it's entirely possible, given bad rolls and bad hands, for the URSS to lose her starting edge, which, in itself, allow the URSS to roughly win 60% of all games, which is not really that big deal to begin with.

ugh. Long, slow and pointless sluggish tug-of-war involving the most agressively tedious and posturing time the west has ever known: the cold war. I would pay to NOT play a game about the cold war. Plus over-reliant on few die rolls. Watch one side win a bunch of straight space race rolls while you don't, to understand how crappy this one can be.

I've always wanted to like Twilight Struggle. #1 BGG game and all that. I don't...cold war stuff bores me to f$%^ing tears. I was a teenager in the 80's, and all I wanted to do was listen to the Dead Kennedys and Corrosion of Conformity (and other assorted rage punk stuff) and shut out the goddamn whining about Russia (or even worse, that asshat Regan). That whole era just disgusts me even still, I want to revert to my punk teenage mindset and tell people where to get off when that political theme comes up in convo. Needless to say, TS is like claws on a blackboard to me. 

even with a different theme, I'd probably rate it a 3, however (I rate 1989 a 3). It just doesn't mechanically come together as an enjoyable experience. I hate the lack of long term planning, the forced play, the lack of control, the random timed scoring, the stuck feeling that never lessens.

I play Washington's War instead--similar style CDG with better theme, better mechanics, half as long playtime, more immersive, more theme evocative, more controlled scoring.

A game I've just begun to explore, enjoyable as a beginner just discovering the cards and mechanics, everything that made/makes this an instant classic game. 

The theme isn't my favorite, but with Imperial Struggle coming, I was (finally) eager to jump in to TS and see what it was all about. 

As I said, the initial novelty makes the game a lot fun, and as I get to know how to better use the mechanics and then finally start to remember the cards ad such, it will take on a more chess-like atmosphere perhaps. I look forward to that time, although I'm sure I'll miss the initial jolt of fun I've had as a beginner--the appeals and down sides of playing a game many times.

A pretty decent cross between a CDG and a Euro area control game. Could use a short scenario and some basic proofreading, but otherwise a good package. Big ups GMT.

Update: There's a bit more to it than I thought, so it earns a promotion to 8.

RATING: 7
Have played once. I'm still trying to get the hang of stringing influencing, coups, and realignments into some semblance of an effective strategy. I *think* I like it, but there seem to be quite a few features that will drive me up the wall after a few plays, like the purely dice-driven space race giving out lots of bonuses and VPs. It reminds me of the Mordor Track from War of the Ring, where all your strategy turns into hoping you roll well on some D6. Right now I'm probably willing to play again, hence my 7 rating. But I'm scared of the game length. It seems that a lot of other games I like compress everything I like from this game into a smaller, tighter package. I'll shut up now till I've played it a few times.


After my second play (with proper rules), I felt *much* more in control of what I was doing, with much more understanding, and managed to win as the US. Some of that is due to reading some of the tips written here, some due to the experience of a whole game under my belt. I do enjoy the game, but I'm very slow at playing it. Also, I don't get very excited about the game.

This is a 9, rather than a 10, because the rulebook is impenetrable compared to how unbelievably easy learning the game actually is in practice.

One of those games which you have to play regularly or not at all. It has undeniable depth and requires a knowledge of all events in the game to play knowingly and for the game to finish under 3 hours. I don't like the game that much (the luck of dice rolls and draws, the CDG mechanic in general) to commit that much time and reading, so I chose not to play it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
I find the subject matter a big draw, and I am a sucker for the production of the deluxe edition, which is very shallow of me. Gameplay is tense and engaging. The main drawback of the game is that the players need to have about the same level of knowledge of the cards for the contest to be fair; but tht is where the long-term strengths of the game appear to lie, in the depth of strategy as the potential of card and board play are explored. Playing out the last century's struggles of the Long War that have shaped this one is an engaging way to spend an hour or two, especially with a glass of single malt whiskey to hand. May not be the greatest game of all time, but it does deserve its spot in the top ten.
Edit: It occurs to me from my misspelling whisky above that the US player really needs to be drinking Bourbon and the USSR player a good vodka.

RATING: 10
I can't believe how good this game is. It gets easier to play with familiarity, but strangely it just gets more enjoyable and not samey as other games might get.  The theme is amazing and gets you into history.  I highly recommend watching the Cold War documentary series on YouTube as you progress through your many plays.  It seems perfectly matched to the game. 

Not many reviews indicate the bluffing nature of the game. This comes through when you have more experience with the cards as each player is deducing what your motivations are from observing your plays and "counting" the cards in the discard pile.  Mind blown. Perfect 10.  

I've moved to playing this on vassal with a non bg friend. He's addicted.  My wife doesn't enjoy the confrontation so much, partly due to time to play is lengthy at first. If I could encourage her to play more she would probably get over that it feels like a chore for her to play.  There are overwhelming choices and decisions for first timers, for quite a few plays I think. It took me a good 4-5 plays before things started to click.  I'm still trying to explore the late war portion more as my play seems to suffer greatly without knowledge of those cards. 

Playing regularly via iOS app with another non bg friend who is addicted to it and has become a tournament player!  Waiting for iPhone version to make my moves faster.  Come on playDek.

Finally I was able to play this baby. And it totally rocks. I'll come back with more when I have the time.

[u]Update:[/u] three games so far, and the last one was brutal. I suffered badly from bad cards and lucky dice rolls of my enemy. It felt like fighting the whole time to keep the head over water without a chance to get the upperhand. Anyway, the games we had were very tense and we both liked it a lot. Have only played with US so far, so cannot comment on USSR play too much.

RATING: 10
The designers have done an excellent job of creating a well themed game with relatively easy rules. Plenty of flavour and agonising decisions to be made, which makes it rather fun. Still, although there's enough die rolling to balance out most of the luck, it does feel as though the dice have a little too much influence in the game - especially in the space race. (Personally I feel there should be a -1 modified to your die roll if you failed your last space attempt.) At a three to four hour commitment the dice outstay their welcome a bit. Still, fun and flavoursome.

Example of the power of the die rolls and how they can make for a dud game occasionally: Things are running along pretty even, then the Quagmire event is played on the US. The US then goes on to discard three cards rolling five or six each occasion. All remaining cards are one value and therefore US has no action rounds this turn beyond headline event. US routed in Europe that turn = game over. That's a lot of power to the die roll! I did this to an opponent once and victory felt completely hollow.

For all the attention I focus on poor die rolling I have to admit that there's enough of it in the game that rolling usually even out to produce a wonderful experience - much like they do in ASL. So, although I go on about the dice a bit much, I still think it's a wonderful game full of character. Must play it with my kids one day under the guise of a history and geography tour.

This is a game that's going to reward repeated plays and knowledge of the cards and when they're likely to appear. For a balanced game it really needs players of about the same experience, otherwise it should be over quickly.

A brilliant 2-player game, players represent the USSR and the USA trying to vie for other world power to side with them.  Using cards that have both points and a special ability, players *must* play cards that help both themselves and their opponents, maximizing gains while, minimizing losses.  The game is nicely divided into early, mid-, and late war, which feel historic and we end up looking up the events on the appendiz to learn more.  The biggest disappointment is the obvious bias toward the USSR.  We need to try using the "extra influence points" for the USA during set-up to see if this mitigates it, but even without doing so, the game still is an absolute blast.

This is just an outstanding use of cards, and is about as intense a hand management game as you can get.

Every card and every action can both help and hurt you like no game I've ever played.  The contrast between hand management and board control creates the perfect balance of strategy and tension.  Knowledge of the cards is important, and mis-matched players could pose balance problems.  

Overall a fast paced game that creates the decision making of a wargame despite the lack of battles while capturing the theme of the time period which makes it far more rewarding than your average eurogame.

The more I play it, the more I want to play it even more.  It is a must own for any gamers collection.

RATING: 3
Very disappointed with the game that's been the top dog for so long.

The advantage an experienced player has over a newcomer leads to a high degree of frustration as the new guy is outmanoeuvred at almost every turn. I was surprised too, for a game that is allegedly such a tight affair due the interplay of the cards, by the amount of luck brought in by the distribution of those cards and die rolls (so, I had one influence, you've run a coup from half way around the world and now you have six influence, huh?). Even if I had the inclination to sit down and learn the cards, the luck factor alone means I won't be going back to try again.

I don't think it's a "bad" game as per the BGG description, but I've rated it 3 to fit with my lack of desire to play it again.

Very compelling, nerve-wracking game. I love the mechanic where the opponent's events trigger on cards you play, especially since you can pitch a card to the "space race" every turn. Adds a nice layer of strategy and anxiety to the game. I'm also very interested in the "conflict" depicted. Docked a few points because I'm not sold on the idea of the scoring cards and because the game is brutally difficult as the USA if you are inexperienced--the early war cards are heavily stacked toward the USSR.

A tough, tense 10 turn game of TS is a joy to play, which makes it so disappointing that you only get one every five plays or so. It's not just the well documented balance problems, it's that the game is unstable, leading to too many early blow outs caused by forces outside the players' control. Too bad, because if this were fixed it would be well nigh perfect

I never thought I would give a wargame (even one that is devoid of soldiers!) such a high rating.  But this one has surprised me.  A brilliant compromise between abstraction and simulation, the "parallel world" that each game of this creates rings true.  And the simplicity of the mechanics allied with the agonising decisions at every turn make it feel like a true hybrid.  Excellent.   (Downgraded by a point now, but only because 1960 is ever so slightly better.)

RATING: 9
Fantastic game. Easy to get into but lots to think about! I prefer this to 1960 b/c it deals with the whole world but both are excellent. The mechanic that the opposing player's events are triggered when you play "his" card creates a lot of tension. Excellent conflict simulation! (Not a wargame imho b/c there are no moving troops but we won't get into the whole wargame definition discussion ...)

RATING: 4
First play was VERY disappointing.  Honestly not sure why this game has such a following.  It's simply an area control points scoring game with a Cold War theme stamped on it.

Things I don't like...
-contrived requirement for "military operations"
-DEFCON status was not even a minor player in the game
-random arrival of scoring cards degrades the historical aspect of the game
-shared deck means many of the cards in your hand CANNOT be used for the Event.  This greatly limits your options for card usage.  
-Limited actions available.  Played the entire game without need for re-alignment...
-Shared victory point track didn't seem to create tension, excitement, interest.
-The way the game handles conflict seems to come up short.  The most aggressive one can take is institute a Coup.  Other than that you are waiting for a handful of cards to show up such as the Korean War, India-Pakistan War. 
-With the above shortcomings, one might expect the map to really shine.  It doesn't unfortunately.  The main playing pieces on the map are a pile of red or blue chits with numbers....not very engrossing.

Things I do like...
-Theme
-Card driven

Was really hoping for more with this game.  I'll give it another play just to be fair.

Always wondered why this game was top of the charts. Yes, it is very good, some tough decision making despite  the simplicity of the mechanics. Very thematic but, if the Cold War was still taking place right now, would this game be as popular? A US win in our own lifetime and a dominant US games market = very popular!!
My first game ended rather despondently with the Soviets winning with the 'Wargames' card in Turn 9 - I was the US. I might have played differently if I was aware of the cards devastating event.

RATING: 6
Tense in the best possible way.  The sense of narrative and the balance between tactical reaction and strategic setup are superb.  One could quibble with some of the historicity or topography, but why bother?  The game works as is and hits pretty much all the sweet spots asked of it.  My first two plays were knocked off in a little over 4 hours each, so it meets the "single sitting" requirement.  Definitely not a Euro, but not a wargame either - more of a "historical" game.  It pretty much does everything I expected of it when I pre-ordered it lo these many moons ago.  Can't ask for more than that.

[b]Update:[/b] Once you more or less know the contents of the decks and how to play them, the interest in the game shifts to min-maxing the anticipation of certain moves. The early game, while not completely stereotyped, gets fairly dull. The midgame is more exciting since the possible spread of cards increases an order of magnitude. Still, knowing the game well means it takes too long to get to that point, and its possible the game "scenario" has gotten too unbalanced to save by then. The game still works, but it's less fun when you've explored most of it.

This is a nearly perfect board game. It's tense, well-balanced, has super tight mechanics and is absolutely oozing with theme. If you like history or have any interest in the Cold War whatsoever, this is a must-own, especially if you also like card-driven games.

My only tiny complaint is the tug-of-war that sometimes manifests itself, where players start cancelling each other's previous turns out in a battle over one critical country.

It's that good. After a few more plays, I would bet this is a ten. I think people just can't stand that this is a war game and is rated number 1. Try this, you will not be disappointed.

Updated from a 9 to a 10. 

I failed to stage a coup in Vietnam and the Soviet Influence spread throughout Asia. The next game I successfully staged a coup in Vietnam and the Soviets had difficulty establishing a presence in Asia. That level of theme is amazing.

Wow, a great game. I can't believe it took me so long to play it, but there you go. Angst ridden decisions at every card play, straight forward rules, minimal chrome/fiddly rules - the coup/no coup rules with the Nuke track qualify but aren't too onerous.

RATING: 9
I knew all along that I would love this game and it'd be a top-5 for me, since I do like 1960: The Making of the President, and something even better sounded too good to be true. And I wasn't disappointed.

The board feels dynamic (this is a key ingredient for majority games) as there is a lot of opportunity to make pivotal moves that completely change the landscape. In 1960, the scope of your move is usually limited to Gathering Momentum, but even that isn't much of a swing, because all the scoring happens at the end. The varied timing of scoring means you're constantly in a knife-fight in the midst of several fires, and trying to eke out enough leeway in the main battlefront to set yourself up in another region.

I thought I'd miss the momentum system in 1960, but I don't at all. The forced trigger of unfavorable cards means it's an extra thing to take into account in terms of setting up your hand and managing the timing of your cards. And the ticking time bombs in your hand fit better with the salvage-what-your-hand-gives-you feel of the game, because you can't cop out of a bad card. You have to play [i]around[/i] it. The trigger also means events happen much more often than 1960, which means the board is more dynamic, and you have to be more deliberate and careful. Every card play becomes a challenge in controlled chaos.

I wasn't 100% sure of a game that boils down to you-play-a-card, I-play-a-card. But each card has 5 uses (3 options + 3 branching options with the Op Points), so you don't feel handicapped but are instead brain-melted by the myriad of approaches available to you (and I thought I'd be well-prepared since I can plan out what order to play my cards in 1960 in 10 seconds). And this game is so tense, you're more worried about coups and nuclear war than trivialities like cards and counters.

I had thought TS would do board positioning better while 1960 would do card-play better. Nah, TS wins hands-down.

5+4

I can see why this game is so highly-rated!  Wow.  Great fun that utilizes the card play in a thematic way that makes plenty of sense.  The Space Race adds a little random risk element and I love how Defcon status integrates with war actions.  First rate game that is worthy of its place on BGG.

I've played it again.  It's phenomenal.  You look at it and might be, there can't be much to it, but to see the political situation evolve in front of your eyes is awesome.  And let me add that the theme isn't one that initially interested me.  This rockets into my top 10.

This game is now my #2 game behind Macao.  The fact that it has passed some of my all-time favorites is pretty indicative of how great this game is, especially considering how little interest I have in the subject matter.

Great game.  The game may take a while to play but it flows quickly, which is important to me.  My first kick at the can was with a co-worker.  I was playing the commies and he was playing the capitalists.  Both of us were newbies so  we kind of muddled through.   By turn 5 (as was reported in most of the reviews) I was working him over pretty good.   Then the bastard plays a series of two cards and the weasel wins.  Oh well, it's still a great game and well worth the cash.

One learning game of it. Hard to evaluate though I suspect I'll end up liking this a lot, I just have to play it frequently (it is fairly long). Also of all long "epic" games this one offers me conflict and interaction immediately. And also features a good narrative with an atmosphere I enjoy and a reasonably slow pace. 

Played it 4 hours for first 4 turns and USSR won as I, the US, made a mistake in opening set up of influence tokens. I suspect the game will give the please Diplomacy does - that it takes some time to learn the irregularities of the game and how some things are better than others and it's only fun when everyone knows what they are.

[41 plays] Afterwards I usually dream of not only the game play, but also of the leaders and events depicted in the game and my associated memories of growing up in a Cold War world.

I'll get my 2 minor gripes out of the way first. 1) Some have told anecdotes of playing this with their wife. No way in hell my wife would tolerate the length and depth of this game. It took us 5 hours to learn and play it the first time, and we did not go past turn 8. However, I do expect/hope that on the downslope of the learning curve it will regularly play in less than 4 hours. 2) The USA is really up against it. It is very challenging for them to survive well into the mid war, where the cards finally swing over to the USA's advantage.

I've tremendously enjoyed the experiences in this game. It has the card play and hand management aspects of games like Lightning D-Day and We the People. It has the area control scoring elements of games like El Grande, Bootleggers, San Marco, etc. It has the point to point expansion, map adjacency analysis, bluffing, and challenges of many a good wargame. It has the angst of always wanting to do one more thing than you can, or worrying that the thing you are doing to help yourself will end up helping your opponent more instead. The theme is very strong and well integrated. It all works for me and I always have a great time, win or lose. I really do feel like I've "fought" the Cold War after each game.

Update Dec. 16th, 2016. I am lowering my rating to an 8. Much like I have done with my rating for Chess, I realize that this game can only be enjoyed over the long term by fairly evenly matched players, and that to play well, there is considerably more investment in learning all of the cards, combinations, and traps than in most of the sophisticated Euro or War games. It can be a 10 for two experienced and dedicated players, it will not be like that for more than a few games between players who do not approach that equity.

A short CDG that's not really about war or troop movement? Wow. 1 to 3 hours? WOW! Count in me in. If only there's a multi-player version of the game!

Update: Someone describes this game as El Grande. It's stretching it a little but in a sense it's true: cards drive the game. You want to place influence in regions/countries. Well, I think this game is more a Euro than a Wargame.

Update: Knowledge of the cards is essential as you want to play cards to YOUR best advantage. The 'luck' of the card draws, die rolls can be frustrating especially since this isn't a 1 hour 'lets go again game'. To play it for 2 hours only to crash out owing to a bad draw isn't my idea of fun. Still, the designers have done well to try and encompass such a wide scope in this game. I fear my experience may be along the lines of Brian Bankler...

Update 2: Sure, bad card draws can hose you but I suspect that experienced players can overcome the draw with smart play. The game rewards patience, knowledge of the cards and a little bluff. I've had 4 games so far and find it to be a rewarding and tense 1-3 hours. Haven't felt this way since I played War of the Rings!

I've only managed to play this game once but its something I'll need to play a few more times before giving it a proper rating and review. My first impressions are it's a solid game that needs to be played a handful of times before you begin understanding it. There's a lot of reading in this game, every card must be read to understand how to strategically plan your next moves. Theres a lot of depth in this game that I would love to learn more about but seeing as it is a 2 player game that requires at least 3.5 hours, its something I wish I can play more frequently!

Good game, but it can be somewhat frustrating due to the luck of the cards and die rolls. Too much luck for a game of this length. Also, the rules are streamlined, but the game is abstract enough that they could have been streamlined a little more. The scoring in particular, is more complicated than it needs to be. I like the theme, especially since I grew up watching many of these events.

RATING: 9
Surprising amount of variety with different clusters of US and USSR events being triggered, delayed, or suppressed on different games. What is interesting is that players will often play their own one-time events for ops delaying the core effect for later when the opposing player has to trigger them, often giving the opponent a problem with a hand full of them other country's events. The character of the game can change quite a bit depending on how theses chains of events are triggered.

RATING: 3
Monstrous area control game with average components (in the "deluxe" version.)
The theme is not badly implemented, but it feels a bit random at times and it feels like just counting points too often. There surely are more thematic games.
Would be better if it was shorter. The 180 minute tag is *very* optimistic. We did not have under five hours. That might get shorter if you know the game very well and have memorized all the cards, but I dont think that usually one is going to get there. Not a good game for everyone who is not a hardcore fanatic for this sort of game and willing to do the time investment.
Plainly, I do not get why this is so high up in many peoples opinion.
My rating might seem a bit harsh, but it accurately depicts my desire to play this game. Also, I fail to see anything particularly original or inventive in this game mechanics-wise, that should cause me to rate it higher.

Area Control, Card Driven. From my 2006 BGG Secret Santa! Um, I'm embarrassed I haven't gotten to play it yet :blush:

Update: finally played it (well, most of the way before my opponent bent the knee because it was getting late and he didn't think he could make a comeback). The game is as tough as it is great. Looking forward to more plays of this, plus the forthcoming game 1960.

Update: finally got a full play in. I really like the game. A lot going on, despite it being basically an area control game. Rating is at least a 9, may  rise with more plays.

Sigh. Traded away after years of dust collecting.

Initial rating. This is the game I was hoping for when I bought Valley's reprint of Hannibal. It's an asymmetrical, exciting, well-themed strategy war game. Our first play, muddling through learning the rules, took around 4 hours, but it was glorious entertainment.

Okay, about 6 plays in - these may be the ultimate 2 player game. It's gripping, involved, and satisfying. There are strategic and tactical choices to make, and each game plays out like a different story. I can't believe I waited so long to get into this. Now...I just need to get my significant other to give it a try! Game length can really vary, but to be safe give yourself 3 hours once you know the rules. It's an awesome 3 hours though.

RATING: 9
Twilight Struggle at times can be a frustrating gaming experience, especially for the US player, who must constantly react to the actions of the USSR player. Also if you constantly have a hand full of your opponent's event cards, you get that feeling that you didn't achieve anything that turn, because you only tried to mitigate the outcome of these events.

Nevertheless, this is an amazing game, that features highly thematic and strategic gameplay, even though the game's mechanics are incredibly simple.
It fully deserves its top spot in the BGG rankings.

Really really liked this.  Can only rate an 8 at this point as it has only been played 2 times so far.  For me I'd expect it to go up as I learn the cards, not sure about the wife though.

Wish I had more time to play, but hard to fit in the longer two player games since when we play longer games it is typically with others and my wife is busy busy with school right now.

It is a brilliant design. My only issue is that the Russians have such and advantage in the early game that the American player better have a solid strategy from the beginning or he is going to loose. It is still a lot of fun and will remain in my collection forever.

There's way too much Eurogamer excitement for this one right now, but if Twilight Struggle can get some Eurogamers interested in some other card-driven games or some type of wargames that would be a good thing.I've only played it once.  My Soviets were behind in the beginning when they should have been ahead, but I was ahead near the end during the Reagan/Thatcher era.  There's no combat involved in the game, although the India-Pakistan War card was played about three different times.  I essentially won the first game in a complete blow-out, and without knowing what I was doing, by playing the very powerful Aldrich Ames card at the beginning of the last turn.NOTE: I have a few problems with the game.  First, certain coutries are given a higher-rated importance in every game even though the importance of some of those countries appears to be questionable.  Second, it's difficult to imagine a country like Israel or Britain joining the Soviet Pac; that should be an almost an automatic victory for the bad guys.  Third, there's no luck with countries easily influencing neighboring countries; Murphy's law is not only present in combat.  Fourth, the idea of scoring continents and regions seems quite artifical.  There must be a better way to handle this scoring.  Perhaps scoring through groupings such as oil-countries, high-population countries, and other such groupings would be a better method.  Fifth, naval power seems to be largely ignored, although the planet is about 70% covered with water.  THIS GAME COULD HAVE BEEN SO MUCH BETTER WITH SOME OPTIONAL RULES.

I will play this game any time I can. Near perfection. It's the only game I've pursued playing digitally, and I consider it to be sort of a gold standard for drama, tension, theme and strategy. I would give it a 10, but the fact that I can't play this with someone new (and expect both of us to have fun) means it is less appealing than some other games at times. For me, a perfect 10 will be a game that gives me what Twilight Struggle gives me, but allows me to share it with others more freely.

I am an ex Magic player who turned to boardgames. There is a learning curve to this game and after initial play I admit I was disillusioned with it and its number one rating. Read some strategy, found out what I was doing wrong in the game in that regard as well as rules mix-up, and now I am can confirm the rating. The thing I liked most about Magic was the attrition battles between two control players. However, those battles only last so long and then its just a painful inevitability of one player winning. This has the same feel (minus the painful inevitability) only it lasts the entire game. I am never not enjoying play even when frustrated with a bad hand or a crummy die roll from time to time.

Wargueim Pol√≠tico con motor de cartas sobre la Guerra Fr√≠a. Mec√°nica sencilla y 110 cartas de eventos, muchos de ellos enrevesados. Desequilibrado a favor del bando ruso.

A gy√∂ny√∂r≈± egy√©ni magyar kiad√°ssal volt szerencs√©m j√°tszani, m√°r ez megadta a j√°t√©k alaphangulat√°t.

Nagyon j√≥ f≈ëleg taktikai, de az√©rt n√©mi strat√©gi√°t is ig√©nyl≈ë j√°t√©k. Nagyon j√≥ hangulatot adnak a k√°rty√°k c√≠mei √©s sz√∂vegei, teljesen bele tudja mag√°t √©lni a j√°t√©kos a hidegh√°bor√∫s t√∂rt√©nelmi helyzetbe. V√©gig koncentr√°lni kell, figyelni a m√°sik j√°t√©kos l√©p√©seit, j√≥kor j√≥ helyen kell befoly√°st szerezni, √°tszervezni vagy puccsot v√©grehajtani √©s persze az ≈±rversenyben sem √©ri meg lemaradni. T√∂k√©letes k√©tszem√©lyes j√°t√©k, komoly j√°t√©kosoknak. El≈ësz√∂r 10-est kapott a j√°t√©k t≈ëlem, de miut√°n az US√Å-t is kipr√≥b√°lhattam kicsit neh√©znek √©reztem.

Giving it a 6 for now because the rule book is well written but I cannot find certain questions as they come up and have to google to find the answer.  More examples are needed.  Maybe I am spoiled by Uwe Rosenberg and how great his manuals are.  Also there is not a good tutorial video out on the Internet.  How can a game be number 1 and not have a 100 videos on how to play it.  Where is Watch It Played and Rahdo?

Played this a few times with an expert, also bought the Steam version.  I can see the brilliance in this game but it is not for me.  A boring theme, boring art, and just had a boring feel to it.  This is one for the history buffs that especially love the cold war era.

I'll never understand how this arguably unbalanced, relatively derivative design (where the only really innovative idea is the card driven scoring), on an interesting but somewhat grim subject, got to bgg number one. Also, how is it the number 1 "wargame"? This thing is not a wargame. It is about the cold war that was not a war, and it is an area control game, with no direct conflict.

Having said that, I do like it too. I'm just surprised by its outstanding success and wide appeal.

Minor negative: DEFCON dropping to 1 because of hosting the Olympics. Edit: or maybe not after the Rio Olympics.

RATING: 9
After scrutinizing the rules and getting ready to play, I was already excited - but the game was still completely unexpected. The rush it creates and the sense of reward after performing a successful coup in East Germany... This is a trully immersive experience, one that no true gamers can miss. 
I was taken aback by the existence of dice at first (everyone knows I don't like luck in my non-luck games), but the implementation of this mechanic fits the theme well, not to mention luck has to be mitigated in order to succeed. 
DEFCON & Military Operations are pure brilliance in effect, opening up so many lanes of relevant decisions. 
At first I wasn't convinced by the Space Race track, but started to value it; it's not only a safety valve for dropping opponent cards (which still leaves them in circulation) - it's also for dropping your own useful cards so that THEY would remain in circulation in case they are not useful enough now. 
All in all - this is a true masterpiece. I will rate it after 5 plays, but seems to be a solid tenner. Cannot find anything wrong with the game.
Except for the fact that it really takes the right opponent to play.

Excellent area-control game marred only by the crappy quality of the components (the board is flimsy cardstock, and the influence markers are the typical 1/2 inch cardboard counters found in wargames).  Don't let that scare you off the game, though.  You'll learn a lot of history and have a terrific time in the process.

Warning--can be more than a little tense!  But then it's the Cold War, what do you expect?

RATING: 8
A deep and rich game based on real events from recent history. Since I've always been very interested in 20th century history and geopolitics, the theme itself draws me to the game. Having previous knowledge about most of the events or people mentioned on the action cards, the gameworld will already be richly populated with characters and history even on turn one. However, should you be playing an opponent who doesn't share you passion for modern history, there is still an excellent game with multiple paths to victory and tough choices to make on every turn. On the downsides, I do feel like the game is a bit tilted towards the Russians, it is not that great for non-native speakers or casual non-gamers (who I mostly play with) and it is only a two-player game. However should you find someone good to play with, the game is excellent.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
This is probably the best intro game into the Card Driven systems.  Everything is clear and feels familiar enough to pick up exactly what is going on in the game, yet the decisions are abound.  The game constantly forces you to chose to put out the fires from a number of minor dilemmas that all can add up to swing your game one way or another.   The game is just bursting with color and chrome, but isn't overwhelmed by it.  Certainly, there is quite a bit of luck here, but you never feel controlled by it.  

That said, what I do feel controlled by is the heavy odds against the US.  This game might get a 9.5 from me if I thought that the US had a decent chance of winning.  As is it just feels like a game where the contest is to see how long the US player can hold on.  That said it is a fun ride.  

UPDATE: It runs a little long for what it has to offer and the US really has to get lucky in the beginning for the fun to kick in.

I rated this game much higher when I got it, but after awhile it has just become sort of blah.  The card play is clever, but not deep, deck management doesn't play a part as much as Paths of Glory so I never feel I'm outplaying my opponent with a 'long game' approach.

Many like this and many will tell me I'm missing something, but it's my rating and it deserves a 7 (willing to play and maybe seek out, but not dazzled)

This is a very good strategy game, to be sure, but it is extremely dry and becomes tedious and boring after a while. It's exciting for the first hour but then the whole game degrades into the same thing - changing the influence tabs back and forth, back and forth, back and forth, and so on. It really is like an arms race. Very solid theme (Cold War) but it's too dry and repetitive for my tastes and it feels like work rather than a fun game.

I've played it some more recently and to add to my above comment... my main problem with the game is the luck element. I don't mind luck but in this game a few critical rolls can really destroy you. Lose both the Korean War and the Arab-Israeli War and suddenly the US is in hot tamales. That's rough in a game that takes at least 2 hours to finish.

I can see why this one is so popular.   Excellent cardplay and a deep historical simulation makes it shine.  Of course, it is not the best board game in the world.  But it does a great job simulating the cold war and influencing areas.  A bit too heavy for my taste, though.

exhilirating ride, this.  the tension created over the three to four hours it takes us to play is terrifically palpable.  every decision is fun to make and feels drastically important.  not a history buff, but the theme seems to crawl up off the game board, manifesting itself as beads of sweat dripping off your forehead as you deliberate in the war room which continent you are forced to concede to the commies this turn as part of the greater plan.  this game definitely gets my blood flowing more than any other.  could do with greater modifiers on the dice rolls, or preferably some other system altogether to better reduce the role luck plays in the game (for example the way 1960 uses the political capital bag for support checks.)

Plenty of give-and-take to this one and lots of interesting decisions on how to use one's cards.  The only downside is that it seems that there are a few idiosyncrasies that may initially turn people off, but being taught by an experienced player or reading some information on the game should fix that.  I need more play before rating it higher, but I was impressed with my initial play.

UPDATE: Having played it again, have to bump the rating, as it's just a wonderfully tense and challenging game; a mental tennis match.

RATING: 4
There is no doubt that this game is extremely well thought out.  The mechanics are incredibly well matched to the theme.  The Cold War event realism is fantastic and the tension is palpable.  I can see the intelligence that went into the game so it is with extreme reluctance that I rate this a 4.  Even though I hugely *admire* the game, I just don't find it fun.  It seems academic (?).  

In fairness, military/war themes are probably my least favorite (in a three way tie with fantasy and space - oy does that limit the field!).... so realistically I should have known better.

RATING: 2
I played this game 3 times and I would be happy to never play it again. Now before I say anything else, I want to say that this seemed very much like my kind of game before I even started playing and I was very satisfied with the push and pull gameplay and many aspects this game had to offer. 

The first game was an early (turn 5 or 6) win by the soviets. The second game we switched sides and was a turn 10 win by the soviets. Both of these were significant victories and had me really wanting to play again.

The third game the allies won on turn 10 because of one die roll. The allies went last on turn 10 and had to roll the die to win or lose the game based on gaining a certain amount of victory points. We literally played for 2 hours to have the game determined on the roll of one six sided die. This is not to say the gameplay was not fun, but I much prefer to have my decisions be meaningful and to be able to play or strategize around the luck of the game.

This was over a year ago and it highly influenced my opinion of the game. I haven't wanted to play it since and I don't think I ever will. I give it a 3 because it was enjoyable in some of its design but was an overall disappointing experience. There are so many games out there that are either more fun, more strategic, or both.

RATING: 10
Great simulation of the Cold War. There's tension every turn. Each card you play must be carefully considered. After your opponent makes a move, paranoia grips you. Why did he make that move? What's he planning? These are the questions you'll ask yourself. In fact your opponent will be thinking exactly the same about your move, reacting to you as much as you're reacting to him. If that's not great storytelling, I don't know what is.

What's more, Twilight Struggle is remarkably rules-light for what it is, proof that there's lots of room for strategy amid dice-rolling and theme-heavy event cards. It can be long, but it can end early in the war as well as late. That's up to the players, who'll create their own story with each play.

My only complaint is the round counter, which is annoyingly fiddly. That's a minor issue, however, for an undeniably great game.

RATING: 10
One of my favorites! It's a very thematic card-driven area-influence/majority game for two. Tension comes from the constant back and forth of trying to spread your influence (only to have the other guy counter!) and from the anticipation of the Score Cards, which _will_ be played but possibly not at a time of your choosing! Also, you have to make a few key choices every turn: 
- Ops or event? Some of your own events are really good but if you use Ops instead, you can hope that they'll come up again after a reshuffle and ideally in your opponent's hands, so the event will trigger automatically!
- Which card to Headline, losing ops but triggering a good event early in the turn?
- Which card to hold till next turn?

You would think that there is too much randomness/luck (card draws, d6 rolls) for a game of this length and weight. But actually, the game seems to be VERY well balanced, at least in the cards: nice balance of Ops values vs. events (for the most part; some cards seem to clearly favor one or the other most times), and although having a Score card in hand means one less Ops card to spend, you do at least get to control the timing of the scoring.

To play well, you really do need to know the cards; probably best if 2 people learn the game together. 

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
USA vs. USSR in the Cold War, divided into 10 turns (Early War 1-3, Mid 4-7, Late 8-10). There are 3 decks of cards, one per stage. The board is a map of the world, divided into continents -> countries (the key "battlegrounds" have purple banner). Each country has a Stability rating (lower makes coups easier), and space for influence markers from each player. Start with a defined distribution of influence + several discretionary influence points (IPs). 

Each turn, players are dealt a hand of cards (8 Early; 9 Mid and Late). Cards are either Scoring cards (score a continent based on control of nations) or have a value (1-4 Ops points) and an event which may be a Neutral, USA, or USSR event. Some events, when triggered, remove the card from the game. At the start of the turn, players simultaneously choose an event to Headline -- resolve in descending Ops value order (ties = USSR first). Then, alternate (USSR first) playing through 6 (Early) or 7 (Mid, Late) rounds. On your turn, play a card for either Ops or event, except: if event belongs to other player it WILL trigger; you decide whether to spend Ops before or after event.

Ops may be used to place influence (adjacent to IP already on board), coup (modified die roll trying to change control of country; earn Military Ops points equal to Ops value of card), realign (modified die roll trying to reduce enemy influence), or to try to advance on the Space Race (each step requires 2 or 3 Ops value card, and a d6 roll; event does NOT trigger). At the end of all the action rounds, lose VP if you don't have the minimum required Military Ops (= Defcon value).

When a Scoring card is played, score the appropriate region. Score is on a VP track going from USSR 20 -> 0 -> USA 20; earning VP = moving marker towards your end of the track. The Early War has 3 Score cards, Mid has the other 4. These award VP based on area majority (presence < dominance < control) -- countries in that continent. The deck is reshuffled in turns 3 and 7, so some regions will score more than once; if game goes to 10 turns, all regions are scored again. 

You win the game immediately if any of the following occur:
- you get to 20 VP
- you control Europe when it is scored
- the opponent reduces Defcon to 1 (coups in battleground countries reduce 1 step; several events also can change Defcon status). 
You win at end of 10 Turns if the score marker is on your side of the VP track.

RATING: 9
I love history and read a lot of historical non-fiction. The setting and mechanics of this game are just sublime! You are making agonizing decisions turn-after-turn, many of which benefit your opponent more than you. The key is the timing of when to play these, not that I'm an expert player.

Another one of my favourite games of all time. As with most 2-player, lengthy games I just don't have to opportunity to play face-to-face that often...hopefully that changes once my children grow older! As for now, I'll settle on the iOS asynchronous implementation.

[i]*Update Dec 2017*
Dropping my rating from a 10 to an 8.5. I still love the game, but after dozens of plays of the iOS app (both vs AI and live opponents) I just find the game to be a bit too swingy at times to rate that high.

p.s. I can't figure out why people call this a war-game?  Although I'm sure it's loved by many war-gamers and it's set in the 'so called' Cold War, this isn't a war-game. It's a card driven blast through history focussing on mainly political events.

Owned: Deluxe Edition

Excellent game -- If the stars align and it's a suitable choice, it's THE choice, so there you go.  Truly epic stuff.

Used to own the regular edition; gave it to my ex's brother... she's gone, but now I have the deluxe edition.  Upgrade!

Edit 07/26/09:  Having played this half a dozen times over the last few weeks, I can safely say that learning the cards is absolutely essential to having any chance against a decent player.  There is so much more going on than it initially seems.  Amazing depth.  The luck factor can be frustrating, but it can also be incredibly memorable.

Revised 08/01/09:  Up to a 9.5.  Just can't give it a 10 for the reasons above, as well as the fact it really does take a lot to learn the nuances of this amazing game.  It's not for everyone, though it's certainly for me.

Revised 01/30/10:  Who'm I kidding?  This is a 10, all the way.  So it isn't all things to everyone, so what?  No game is.  And for what Twilight Struggle [i]tries[/i] to do... well, it nails it.  Perfection.

So I finally got to play the number 1 game on BGG since I've started in the hobby and the verdict?  It's pretty damn good.

Granted, this is not a game that intrigues me at face value past the curiosity why it is number 1 and by such a large margin and for such a long time.  I wasn't sure I was ever going to play it because I don't know anyone that has a copy or would really fit into the game's demographic either.  And it's not one that you can just impulse buy or pull out to play for 3-4 hours with one other person at a convention.  I added it as a want in a Math Trade though and finally got it on my shelf and it didn't take that long actually to get it to the table.

My opponent in this game had the perfect one-word description for this game.  It is the euro game made for wargamers.  The actual game play is a card driven area control affair.  There are no real battles or troop management so you couldn't really classify it as a wargame.  There are quite a few wargame trappings to it though.  First of all, it is incredibly rich with history.  There are over a hundred cards in this game and each one represents an event or news headline from the Cold War time period the game takes place in.  Half of the rulebook lists each card with a text block that at first glance I thought was rules clarifications but nope, they are little history lessons explaining what exactly happened in history that the card represents.  GMT has also fashioned the rulebook and components in the way they know best, like they were selling a wargame.  The rulebook contains almost no diagrams and explains the game through section and line numbers and lain out on a table you would swear it were a war game with a map of the world covered in tiny, square, numbered, cardboard chits.

I will say though that even diagram-less, thanks to being extremely well-written and tons of "designer's note" blurbs and examples the rulebook is excellent and explained how to play the game and resolve strange interactions very well.  The gameplay itself while being pretty fiddly is actually quite simple.  Each game turn is made up of 6-7 card play rounds where you either follow the event text on the card or use the card for its "operations value" to maneuver influence in different areas.  This continues for 10 turns and the points are a tug of war with the winner being whoever has the most at game end (there are also specific objectives that can achieve an immediate victory such as taking complete control of Europe or having your opponent cause global nuclear war).

I think the most interesting thing about this game is how all of the cards relate to either the US faction, the USSR faction, or both.  Events of your opponents faction only help them but you can draw them into your hand.  You can still play these for their "operations points" but it also  triggers the event as if they had played the card.  There are a few ways to prevent this but you will still end up giving your opponent free benefits several times throughout a game.  This introduces an incredible amount of depth as you try to use these cards in ways that mitigate the benefit your opponents get form these cards.

In the end this game is one of the most intriguing I've ever played.  I lost horribly in my first play but it is one where I definitely view the first play as a learning game and it took that whole first game to really understand all the moving parts.  I really want to play this game again, which is a good thing.  The problem is though that being 2-player only and incredibly long really doesn't offer the opportunities to play it again I would like.  Most of my game time is with groups and when I do hang out with someone one-on-one the 3-4 hour play time is a big deterrent (BGG lists play time as 3 hours, my first play which included rules explanation, eating, and socializing took about 3.5-4 so that's probably close to right).

It's not a huge box (which is more than I can say for other time sinks, I'm looking at you Merchant of Venus) so it is definitely going to live on my shelf, at least for a while, but I'm really not sure when or how often it will get played.

I will conclude by saying the game is incredibly fiddly, maybe war gamers are used to the little, square, different-numbered, chit management this game requires but I'm not.  The guy who I got my copy from put the chits in a couple of those daily pill boxes which is a great idea in theory and awful in practice because human fingers were not meant to grab chits out of those tiny containers.  Also, trying to put them back in any kind of organized fashion takes a long time.  I'm considering buying 4 different colors of those boxes of 36 12mm Chessex dice and using them to represent influence instead, I just need to decide first if I'm keeping the game and if it will get played enough for that to be a worthwhile investment.

This is a superb CDG! The game is tense, fun, and frustrating. As with many of the CDG's, you never have enough resources to do what you want (and be prepared for your opponent to thwart you at any turn). I've played this game many times since its release. I've taught several players to play it and they're all addicted, just like me. Don't look for historical accuracy; CDGs don't do this well. However, you will experience more than a bit of the flavor of the times. Great game!

It's so hard to rate this game.

I love the theme and I think this could be the most solid themed game in my colection. And that could result in a higher rating once I'll play it more.

The victory conditions are very well balanced, the inicial cards make it a bit easyer to USSR but the middle and late war cards equalize the results.

Very clever and, last but not least, my first card driven mechanic game. Because of which I became a huge fan of the "system".

edit #1: I still like the game very much now that I've played it a couple of times more. I have a complaint. Some cycles of cards could make the game too easy or too dificult for one or another player. They could even determine the victory for either nation in a couple of turns. Meaning that some games could last 3 hours and others less than one. Also meaning that some games are interesting and others don't.

edit #2: Too much luck involved. It's very difficult for me to spend 3 hours playing and even controling a game and then, with two bad hands of cards loosing it. And it has nothing to do with bad playing! It has to do with luck. LUCK!

I don't mind games with lots of luck such as Thebes or Conquest of Paradise. But playing three hours, burning the brain, and everything is resolved by the card draw and especially the dice, is not for me. It could be for me now and then but only because I love the theme. And it also helps the fact that now I know that I could actually win or loose it if I'll have more or less luck than my opponent!

I still love the theme though and that's why I rate it a 6.

Edit #3: I've rated it a 4 because it is one of the most unbalanced games I√Ç¬¥ve ever played. It doesn√Ç¬¥t make any sense at all. USSR wins almost everytime I play it and that makes no sense to me. I do not have fun at all when playing with the US because it√Ç¬¥s all about damage control. And if the USSR player has some luck (dice luck) the game is over after 3 turns! I√Ç¬¥ve seen Italy being taken in the first USSR impulse with a coup attempt because the player rolled a 6 and took US 3 starting OP√Ç¬¥s of influence! After that and adding all the USSR events that are favorable to USSR, an Europe scoring is more than a safe run to the USSR player. Adding the fact that the China card and almost all asian events give USSR a great boost in Asia. So, this is not a balanced game and I almost sugest that this game could be broken.
I do not understand why so many people likes such an unbalanced game!

A fantastic influence game that draws the best from both the european and the wargames families. The unbalance exists, but only because it is easier to win early with the USSR. I you end up in the middle of the second pack without a strong USSR lead, you will probably see a US victory, and this puts a lot of pressure on the Soviet. It's nice that they play differently.

The game asks for a few plays before one gets an idea of the general schedule of events. Do not pass on this one, as it is both accessible and deep.

The push-pull tension hits on turn one and stays at full throttle, the cards and the area control aspect provide two very different and interesting strategic sets of decisions, and the thematic applications are clever and quite entertaining. Late in the game, it can all become just too much as you try to keep an eye on so many different fronts of conflict--and the optimization miniutiae really bogs it down at the end if you're playing seriously--but if you can take that level of choice, this one is rightly admired. To me, the key to it all is the designers' decision to settle on the one thing they perceived the Cold War to be about--spreading influence--and set aside everything else so they could keep things wonderfully lean. Utterly absent are resource management, combat, etc., and it was a brilliant choice.

An annoying game I traded away.  I'm actually retiring undefeated, and I still don't like the game.  The political slant - indeed, the whole premise - bothers the heck out of me.  Where's MLK when we need him?  Oh, right: dead.  Rats.

Aside from that, we found the play to be a bit boring.  Yes, there were some choices, but too frequently one choice was always better than the others.  Sometimes we'd choose a less-desirable option just for variety, and the results were always predictable: it was a mistake.  And Brian Bankler is right: the luck of the draw is heavier in this game than in most card-driven games.  Feh.  I'm looking forward to Free at Last - hopefully that'll do what this game should have.

The card-driven system boiled down to its most elegant essence.  While very playable casually, many players are not so casual.  There is a tremendous Jedi v. ewok phenomena with this game; go against an experienced player and in the immortal words of the Emperor, "You will be destroyed."  If you bring it, I'll play it but I don't need my own copy.

A very good game.  However when you are playing against a very experienced player you stand a very good chance of getting your butt whopped.  Memorizing all the tons of cards gives you a huge advantage in the game, and being able to remember what was played is an even bigger advantage.  Suffice it to say my memory isnt that good, therefore I can only give the game an 8 even though it probably deserves better.

A game so good that it is simplistic to comment. Perfectly recreated the atmosphere of the Cold War between the U.S. and USSR, the tensions are palpable to every drawing cards associated with an event. Space missions, coups and a lot of tactics and strategy. It's a war-game in concept, but it is in all respects a card-driven. Truly a very great game!!

One play - a 7. Can still go both ways.

Three plays. I like the tension of wondering when a region will be scored. Hand managment also seems much more important here than in 1960, which I just played for the first time. The extreme randomness of war cards and several dice rolls in general put me off slightly though. Still added to #10 on my top list.

Four plays. Upped to 7.5
The tension and hand management is really starting to grow on me. I think I'll try to get some more friends to try this out with me.

Tried it out online. Upped to 8. I think this has value that will keep shining. It's a good game!

Playing the new app for iOS. Nice. The AI isn't very good though.

At the time of this writing Twilight Struggle is number one on the Geek and it certainly is one of the finest games I've ever played.

Unfortunately, it wins the award for the worst written rule book of any game I've ever played and it took three games for me to finally get the rules down properly, which are not all that complex.  I recommend you read the extended example of play, because it is the only way the game is intelligible.

It is a bit awkward practically because game length is unpredictable, but it gets better every time you play it, which is very unusal.

This is an in depth simulation of the Cold War.If you're a history nerd, you'll immediately recognize the 100+ historical event cards in the game.

I have a hard time rating this.  It does a great job of integrating history into interesting game mechanics, but the luck element seems awfully high for such a long game.  It can be very frustrating if you get a bad card draw several turns in a row, and there isn't much you can do to change that.  My boyfriend (who is a history buff) likes this more than I do, but it just didn't click as much for me.  I can see some people really loving it (i.e. wargamers, history buffs) and it's one-of-a-kind so even though I probably only see myself playing this sporadically, I've boosted its ranking to reflect that it is a quality game, even if it's not my cup of tea.

40+ plays:  This is a FANTASTIC 2 player game - my favorite non-abstract 2 player game.  It's another one of those games that gets better with each play.  The ending was a huge (nuclear) surprise for a long time until we really learned all the cards and how to avoid the big surprise endings.  The fun is in trying to make the best of what you're dealt.  The win will go to the most experienced player from what I've seen, since knowing all the cards in the game well lets you plan better strategies.  I cant wait until we all know the cards perfectly to see where the meta takes us.

The randomness of the cards guarantees a high replay value.

On the other hand, the victories have been all significativelly different*, so I have no feeling the game is pre-scripted

RATING: 7
I heard Twilight Struggle described as three hours of damage control, which sounds about right. It's three hours of tense back-and-forth, playing events that might benefit the enemy as much -- or more -- as they benefit you: how can you time it to help them least?

Decisions are interesting and multi-layered: operations points can be spent in different ways, different regions are valuable at different times, each of the historically-based cards is unique and imposes its own requirements, and over all looms the shadow of DEFCON 1 and nuclear war. What I love about wargames and other simulations is the [i]texture[/i]: playing them feels more real, somehow, not like an exercise in mathematics. 

But as someone with an avowed preference for luckless or very low-luck eurogames, it's difficult to enjoy. Insofar as expert play requires memorizing the effects of 150 unique cards, the stage of the war in which they will appear and tracking their place in the deck, I have zero interest in becoming an expert. I am assured that strategy is critical, but there is a lot of luck in the game, from card draws to dice rolls; it takes a degree of experience I do not have to be confident that it is the better player, rather than the luckier, walking away with the victory.

Further compounding the problem is the playtime. Short by wargame standards (where any game playable in a single day, let alone a single evening, is short), three hours or more is a heavy investment -- and I normally say that a game with this much luck is too long if it's over 30 minutes. Sure, it's a tense, enjoyable experience, at least for a while, but after three hours that starts to wear, especially in the likely event that the game's conclusion feels cheap or otherwise unsatisfying.

With experience I might grow to love it, but for now it's a game I admire more than I enjoy. Maybe it would hit the table more often if I only played the Late War scenario...

RATING: 8.5
TS is an area-control with a smooth and clever card engine game which puts the players in control of one of the at-the-time super powers, either playing with the USA or the USSR, the feeling experienced playing each single card in your hand trying to push forward your strategy, but also can help your opponent's. The struggle is experienced since the beggining of the game. Very well designed game which leads you to live the experience of those years and how the leadership of both countries managed to try to win the cold war. Depending the player's knowledge of the game and its analysis-paralysis, the game can take from 1 1/2 hours to 2 1/2. So if you are eager to know the history and feel as one of the power players of the time and have the time to play it, this a must try.

Sorry that this game does nothing for me. The randomness is too much. I understand that the "strategy" involves minimizing the risk, but I believe that the outcome comes down solely on whoever gets the best hand--especailly scoring cards. I enjoy other card driven games like For the People and Washington's War since bad hands can be mitigated by decisions made by the player. I don't like how your opponent's event cards go into effect when you play them as OPS. Both Washington's War and For the People have better systems that use the opposing events in your hand.
 On the plus side, the game is easy to play and be completed in around two hours. Kudos also to the VASSAL mod creator who did a great job with the TS module.

This is a very difficult game to describe.  Normally mixing aspects of other games doesn't produce a good result, but Twilight Struggle takes aspects of Risk, Go, Poker, and even resource-utilization games like Puerto Rico and mixes them together to wonderful effect all set around the historical theme of the Cold War.

It's definitely a game you appreciate more each time you play it.

To be clear, this is my PERSONAL OPINION of the game and not an objective judgment of the game's play quality, which I suspect is pretty high. I just did not enjoy this game and do not want to play it again! 

My dislike of this game is probably biased by having played against someone who had played so often he had memorized most of the cards; everything I did, he had seen before and knew exactly how to counteract me or capitalize on my play. Perhaps if I'd played against someone of equal skill/experience I would have liked it more, but I'm pretty sure this is not my kind of game.

I really wanted to like this, given my interest in the era and other great reviews, but I just didn't.

RATING: 7
[GMT Games 2nd (2005) edition] {Cold war; dice-rolling, simultaneous action, combat-card-driven} Twilight Struggle is an interesting war game. It's very thematic! It's an unusual war game that there are virtually no wars during the game but a political influence of the 2 superpowers.

TS is a deep game, yet tactical due to largely card draw.  However, players still have certain control about the cards to be used, esp. leaving useful event to late game.  It has very good player interaction at the event cards and reaction on the board.  One must react to the board quickly to avoid surprise regional scoring.

TS has a long learning curve.  Players need several games to understand the purpose of each action, the relationship / function / timing of the event cards.

TS has luck, esp. in dice rolls. A string of low rolls in realignment and coup attempt can be devastating.  The situation is even worse for coup attempts because you only get one-shot chance.  In addition, bad card draw can be killing; esp. for the US players in early game.  The scoring cards have problems, too ‚Äì I wonder, what can a player do if he/she drew 5 scoring cards in his hand.

The rulebook is one of the nicest rulebooks I have ever read - it's clear and well-structured with detailed examples. Besides, it provides descriptions of the history and includes designers' notes.

RATING: 9.8
I don't usually rate a game if I haven't played at least a dozen of times, but this one was so impressive I had to make an exception.

The game is just awesome. Perfectly balanced.

It has a TON of options, for every card you have in hand, and you have many, you can use it for 5 different actions.

The number of options playable is just amazing. And that is not the best part of the game.

There are 110 unique cards, and each and every one of those has a real world event/person behind it, and the effect of the card if in correspondence with the person/event behind the card.

Further more, the rules of the came like the ability to do coups in Europe in accordance to defcon status, the rules for the space race, everything just feels like the events that were occurring in the cold war. It FEELS like rewriting the history, with every subsequent repercussion of your actions.

I was just amazed.

The reason why it is not 10.0 yet, it's because it is very hard to find someone willing to spend 6 or so hours, just to play this game, and it is very hard to spare 6 hours from your normal day to invest it in playing a game. BUT it is WORTH it, every single minute.

RATING: 6
OK, I'm going to rate this one now having played 3 games of it.

Fun game, plays quickly given the scope of the conflict it simulates.  The best thing about the game (to me) is how nicely the rules engineer the historical shift of conflict between the superpowers from Europe and Asia to Africa and the Americas, with the Middle East remaining significant throughout and Europe being put back into play late.  Very, very good design accomplishment.

The "my Ops, your event" dynamic is also a good one, which makes hand management more interesting than some other CDGs.

Drawbacks?  Some of the events are too cutesy and/or complicated in their effects (Wargames and Missile Envy being good respective examples), but that's a marginal complaint.  A bigger one is that the game can feel a little bit bland--place some markers, count countries, place some markers, etc.  But fortunately the theme is compelling enough and the overlay of the game mechanics is believable enough that most of the time it's still fun.

Overall, I think this is an excellent game about the Cold War.  It plays in a reasonable time frame, and as I said before accomplishes the very impressive feat of modeling the history well with a minimum of bells and whistles.  This game may well replace some of the fiddlier CDGs in my game cabinet.

EDIT:  I'll probably never play this again, and wouldn't choose to play it if I had a choice of other things to do.  So even though I like/have no objections to it, I am going to downgrade it.

Wonderful game! Great theme integration, the variety of the cards should keep this fresh for repeated play. I played last night, we started at around 9:00 pm and when we were done at 12:00 am it felt like no time had passed at all. I then dreamt about the game all night. My rating my improve with repeat playings. I just love this game! I hav played this lots more with a few different players and I wiah that the BGG ratings went to 11, cause this game deserves it. A true masterpiece, I feel like 10 years from now I will play this with my children and love it just as much.

Only one play, and we were obviously stumbling over both the rules and strategies, but it seems OK. Coming from a euro-gamer background, it feels like a fairly simple 2-player area-influence game with iffy production values and more "theme" based luck & fiddlyness than I'd normally go for.

Perfect level of complexity for someone like me - basically a Euro gamer who likes a lot of options but not a ton of rules.  It has more of a Euro (basic area influence) feel than a wargame feel in my opinion.  I'll probably have to get Hannibal now as I really enjoyed the card driven "wargame" system here.  Two negatives - such a game can/will get really intense, and there is a TON of luck in the card draw and single die roll (now, I'm sure a good player would trounce me every time... I'm just saying if you pick this up to play with someone of relatively equal experience/skill, you'll have some big breaks with the die/cards).  That is what it is, but single die rolls are going to have massive impacts, and drawing potent card combos even more.Rating might go up to 9 once I get a better feel for the cards and the game begins to play quicker.

I love the design!  I don't normally get into wargames, but there are so many mechanics in this one that just make me grin with delight.  I love the zero-sum scoring.  The cards are well thought-out.  My first game was as the US and I lost, but not until turn 8.  I definitely want to play this again.  And again.  The only drawback is the length, but that's certainly not unusual for a game with this much going on.

RATING: 6.25
Interesting game, but it feels a bit scripted in that each card must activate if it helps your opponent. Additionally, the super heavy importance of dice really distracts me from the game. Love the theme and some of the mechanisms are really cool, but I much prefer 1960 over this.

It's a hell of a lot simpler than I thought it would be. i thought I'd never get to play it because it's too heavy for my friend group, but it's actually incredibly elegant, and very easy to pick up. Obviously, as a card-driven wargame, it's very very thematic. It feels excellent. I don't think I have the strategy down, but I always hope I get to play more!

Well balanced.  The game can last 30 minutes or 3 hours depending on how well you and your opponent play your cards.  Each round of each turn can have you on the edge of your seat.  I've had vicious mudslinging matches with my brother and in the end the underdog triumphs.  The only complaint I can make, which doesn't stop it from being a 10, is that luck plays a huge factor and can easily prevent you from being able to get ahead or stay ahead in the final turns.

Played it once and did not enjoy it. It just takes way (way! Waaaaaay!) too long for what it is, playing events and exerting influence back and forth and hoping for lucky dice rolls. I'd say this if our game had lasted the usual 3-4 hours, and since our play lasted more than SIX hours... yeah.

Too early to comment much. One or two weird issues bothering me.

1) One of the core actions, Re-Alignment, does not seem that useful to me. Neither I nor my opponent used it in Game 1. This seemed strange to me.

2) Knowledge of the deck's specific events seems like it will be crucial. I prefer a setup like Dominion's, where there are a smaller number of special cards out there that you can examine at any time. This sort of situation HEAVILY favors the more experienced gamer.

I realize the "large deck of cards" is a core feature of CDGs and is an important part of maintaining retail value, but I don't like features that specifically reward Playing Game X Many Times.

A game that really lives up to the hype. Despite the feeling of panic I feel playing it, I'm confident my opponent is likewise feeling panicked. Highly enjoyable.

A long deep game with an exciting mechanic which means you have to play cards that are good for your opponent whilst trying to make your own way. Give you an authentic feeling of desperation that your opponent is feeling too.
Victory points are measured by how many more than the opposition you have scored. Clever scale.
I feel that you can come back from a deficit by monitoring how the world wide conflict zones are shaping up for a scoring session; which have to happen whether your ready for them or not.
Seems daunting when you set it up at first but it is a very exciting game that adsorbs you totally.

Outstanding card-driven game that recreates the Cold War struggle for global supremacy between the USA and the USSR. The gameplay is actually very simple, where you play a series of cards each featuring an event based on historical occurrences, in an attempt to extend the influence of your respective super-power across the world. It's more of a challenge to play as the USA as you attempt to prevent an early Soviet victory as they have all the early momentum. As the game progresses though it begins to swing in favour of the USA, providing the USSR hasn't already won. The historical detail that's been poured into the game's design is highly impressive and this results in the gameplay and theme juxtaposing to an unprecedented level for a board game. There's extraordinary depth here and the result is simply one of the finest games out there.

This is a nice game, which could have been a classic. Unfortunately, it has a few glaring problems that keep it from being as good as it could have been in my opinion (and IMO make it overrated).

1. Card-Counting Galore: All card-driven games allow players to do card-counting. In this game, it is pretty much a prerequisite - if you don't count cards so that you know when those critical scoring cards are coming out (and some critical events), you are at a severe disadvantage to your opponent. Know the deck or lose the game. This is the card-driven mechanic at its worst. 

2. Over-Powerful Cards: There are a number of cards/card combos that are extremely powerful. Some are ridiculously so - especially if the opponent is unlucky when you smack them on him. Again - all card-driven games have a certain amount of dependence on the luck of the draw; but bad card luck in TS will cost you the game against a competent opponent.

3. Critical luck: The game suffers from critical luck in far too many places; i.e., a few critical dice rolls that can essentially ruin your game. Part of the problem is that the game in general relies way too much on dice rolls to determine whether your card actions have any effect - and if you fail significantly of those than your opponent, you will probably lose if your opponent is good - already a problem (but one it shares with many games). But the game o worsen the situation, the game doesn't have luck evening out - in every game you will tend to have 2-3 dice rolls on 1D6 that are absolutely critical to your position and which will swing a lot of points if you fail. Fail those 2-3 central dice rolls while your opponent make his, and you will lose - guaranteed - unless your opponent is incompetent.

All this would be OK if this was a 2-hour game. For a game that will easily run you to 4-5 hours, these are IMO fatal flaws. There are better 2-player card-driven games out there that do not have these weaknesses.

Edit: Updated after playing the electronic edition, and my criticism remains the same. Can be fun to play online, but the time spent is still overly long.

Brilliant design. Requires some knowledge of the cards to play well.  I love how it creates paranoia akin to the cold war.  When your opponent plays in an area; Why is that important to them? do they have some knowledge I don't? should I respond? is it a bluff?  It creates great tension.  2008/2/13

I like the coldwar theme a lot. And this game implements its theme superbly. The components, however, are low-quality, the price too high for what you get and the rules could be simpler without comprimising the quality of the gameplay, leading to a quicker game (say, a 90-minute-game). Then would be an 8. But the theme was well chosen...

This game fully deserves the credit √¨t got. I was sceptical that the game was really that good being the no. 1 on BGG for quite a while. I thought a bunch of nerds must have ranked it that high, since the topic seemed too special to be to everyones liking. Now that I have played the app 30 times in 2 weeks and bought the physical game, I can only recommend it to anyone who loves light rules with high tactical depth. The fact that I love history and geography is a bonus. For everyone undecided, try the app first. It gives you hours of fun

Best 2 player game on the market. Period. The atmosphere is done brilliant, the gameplay is well thought of. 

Some points keep it from being a 10:
1. Not playable vs everyone: non-gamers and most women spring to mind.
2. Rules do have a learning curve. Best if you can find someone to teach you the game.
3. There are a lot of things to be thought of, not everyone likes that.
4. Play time is too much for a midweek evening. Including set up you'll need 3 to 4 hours for it.

Other than that: brilliant game, with subtle strategies you only discover after a lot of plays. Basic game design follows two main tracks: on one hand it's about constantly anticipating on what your opponent is doing. On the other, it's about playing your cards to maximum effect or playing your opponent's cards for minimum effect. Balance that and you'll start to discover the depth of this game.

Excellent game. The mix of theme and mechanism fits perfectly. The only thing wich seems problematic at first sight, replayability, is in fact a major plus to the game. When you know that "Fidel" or "De Gaulle" will someday come to play, you know where to put your efforts. Knowing the cards is one of the great pleasure of this game. In fact, to play a few time with the same opponent to have the approximate same level of knowledge of the cards, is a good idea. Can't be silent about the famous "China card"; what an incredible idea to put the intrigues of Mao as a powerfull card that changes hand after it has been used...

*Extremely thematic, love it :)

My brother, who loves history, will probably never play this game with me again because the dice just screwed everything up. IMO, the luck factor is too dominant.

If the luck factor was less prominent I would give this game a much higher score.

Great two player game. The card mechanics are brutal and force you to measure up what you're going to do vs. what they get to do. The points system makes the game feel like a tug-of-war. Very informative too, with the back few pages dedicated to explaining the events on each card. Game board is a little fiddly (the way it's folded means it won't stay flat). Highly recommend.

All the back-and-forth problems of 1960 with only a few tweaks (the managing of the DefCom levels to prevent retaliatory coups requires further thought). I honestly prefer the 1960 theme as the Cold War means little to me and I don't have the familiarity of the events and people involved.

Also, I prefer the cubes to the player tokens.

I can see the appeal, but it doesn't solve the problems of 1960, I like the theme less and it seems less balanced (I think this is generally, grudgingly accepted).

Requires additional plays though.

I've never been bunch of a boardgamer/conventional wargamer. I was always more of a miniatures wargaming player, and being put off by games like ASL that look cumbersome beyond words.

An older friend had mentioned this game, and the concept intrigued me. I had even cataloged some of them when I worked at a game store for a year. So I contacted him and we agreed to play a game on a Friday night. We played casually and took our time (partly because I was new), and a few hours later we were done. It was a fantastic game. 

It had a reasonably easy learning curve, and has just the right level of complexity. It's not too complex you get bogged down in minutia, but complex enough that it has depth. 

I played as the Soviets, and I put up a hell of a fight with him saying it was one of the tougher games he had played. 

It's fun seeing how the strategies on board develop, because it's not just the cards in your hand, but anticipating following turns, reacting to your opponent, and even perhaps misleading them with your own moves.

As someone born in the later days of the Cold War and *vaguely* remembers the wall coming down it does maintain a sense of the feel of the conflict in a number of ways that those who love history will enjoy, while those who are not well versed in history won't be overwhelmed by the flavor.

It was good enough that I bought a copy for myself the very next day.

As someone who typically doesn't play these kinds of board games (or nearly any), I do highly recommend this game. 

The only recommendation I would make is grab a few extra bags to store counters in so they're more organized.

2p tug-of-war with incredible amounts of tension thanks to the DEFCON track. Deck knowledge is crucial (though you can say that about a lot of card games... TtA comes to mind). A new player without knowledge of the cards (or a basic working understanding of the history of the period) is going to get trounced, plain and simple.

The conceit of having to deal with opponent events is brutal, and knowing how to soften the blow of those events while timing the big events is essential. It's a wicked design. The way the pieces fit together is quite ingenious. 

It's an epic game, and probably tilts toward the "too long for what it is" category. 1960 does similar things in half the time, and Wir Sind Das Volk tackles a similar topic, arguably with better results.

The grandest, most intense, most thematic game about the Cold War I've played (also the only, but frankly I don't believe anything could execute the Cold War at this scale any better). I am biased, though, as it is already my favorite historical era, and this game captures that feeling perfectly (as I assume it felt; I never lived it myself).
EDIT: Some widely agreed-upon matters of balance mean the optional cards should not even be considered optional. Still great. The rulebook could use a few clarifications here and there, though.

So good. If you are a history buff or like deep strategy and plotting, then you will love it. The problem. It is a long game. Each play has been 2-3 hours for me. The other problem is finding someone to play. It's not a light game, and takes some learning and patience to get into it. Don't expect your wife to play with you.

RATING: 3
I just played it once. I can understand that the game will get better when you know the cards. However, without knowing them, it isn't a strategic game, it's all about luck.

For example, you may spend your china card for placing influence in Japan, just before your opponent play an event that removes all your influence there...

Yes, I know, every game has a learning curve and you can't pretend to make no mistakes in your firsts plays. However, here, in this game, mistakes come not (only) from a poor evaluation of your possibilities, but from the ignorance of the events there exists. In your first game, you have to take tons of decisions, but you don't have any clue, any information, to decide which options are better. Is like playing chess without knowing the rules of some pieces.

So, I should play 5 to 10 times (i.e., 15-30 hours), making random decisions. Then, I'd be able to take decisions, understand my mistakes, improve... well, to play. No way. I'd rather play Agricola or Mage Knight. In these games you can take decisions since your very first play.

My favourite game, the randomness is sometimes a big factor but 90% of the times that we play we enjoy every minute of it.

The game has only two big weaknesses:
- the randomness factor, sometimes very annoying
- it lasts up to 4 hours

Looking at a plain global map isn't exciting, and trying to put more numbers in a box than my opponent isn't especially exciting, but that's a bottom line simplification of Twilight Struggle...and how I remember my first very long game. The cards/events didn't really fire my imagination and often were just used for their action point value. These "events" and all of the dice rolling resulted in conflict as abstract as Pandemic or Catan, and no more exciting.
If this game were an hour, and had more detailed battles or some sense of individual growth or adventure or peril, I might enjoy it, but I lost interest halfway through my first game--a game that I was alternately winning and losing depending on die rolls. By the end of that experience, I gave it away--my interest was such that I didn't want to spend another 3 or 4 hours within this highly abstracted (though not hard to comprehend) numbers game.
There are certainly some cool ideas, but mostly it felt like a Risk area control game with cards functioning like additional die rolls more than things that altered how I played or viewed playing.
More than once I imagined the monsters of Blood Rage, Mage Knight, and Cave Evil stomping across this stark map while the soldiers from Ambush!, D-Day at Omaha Beach, and Thunderbolt Apache Leader tore up the terrain...which shows my level of engagement in Twilight Struggle when compared to games that actually engage my imagination.

Good game with nice card driven mechanism. However, game have few problems. Main problem is that one game can take anything from 30 min to 300 min to play. It's not a problem if you have 300 min time to play but this happens rarely. Second, there is some strong luck element with cards (as always with card driven game). Third, there are cards that give control of single nation to one or the other player ragrdless of how much power the other have. I don't like these cards very much because those cards must be know or they could sift the balance of the game in critical moment resulting to victory of the player that knows the card.

I know I should probably like this game more, but I just can't get past the boring theme, the "influence" the "thinking about thinking to influence" in a fictional game, I would rather just have it be armies fighting one another.  I was also a bit depressed that while the space race was represented it was basically a back-seat mechanic, and that was the only part of the games theme I enjoyed.

I am sure the mechanics in this game are superb and it plays well, but I can't play this long of a game with a theme that seems to be designed to be bland and un-enjoyable except for history buffs.

Fantastic game. It is a bit unbalanced and favours the Soviets in the early game. Also, I feel that it is quite unforgiving. You really have to be focused and keep a lot of factors in check - definitly not a game that you can play lightly, even if the game is relatively short and has simple rules.
Update November 2010: Lowered rating from 9 to 8. Still a great game, but there is no way to deny, that the game is a bit luck-driven and that the player who has all cards memorized has a huge advantage.

I like this game a lot - it is well balanced and the theme is an integral part of the game. There is a pretty good learning curve to the game. Mechanically, it isn't too bad to pick up, but by learning curve, I mean the cards. Knowing what cards that are in each era, knowing when scoring cards enter the game, knowing where you can avoid wasting precious Ops points are all important and a player that is more familiar with those will easily dominate a player that doesn't. There are some great subtleties to the game that you can only see after a number of plays and if you are constantly beaten quickly, it is hard to learn them. Of course the flip side to that is that there is a lot of hidden beauty and depth here. Every playing is different, even with the same cards and events. Your hand might dictate trying to better your position in a way you never have before.

This is one where the electronic version speeds up the game a lot. On the table, it is not easy to quickly determine that status of an area, nor your chances of any given action - things that are easy in the electronic form. You lose some of the meta game, but being able to rattle a game off in under an hour is a good trade.

This is a truly phenomenal game.  Yes, there's plenty of luck, (like many 'CDGs') but there's also plenty of strategic depth.  It just drips with theme, it plays pretty quickly (especially using Bruce Wigdor's java implementation, which can be found on wargameroom.com), and has unmatched replayability: after what must be 100+ plays (no, I haven't logged them, but I'm sure it's been that many, even guessing very conservatively), I still keep coming back for more!  I can't imagine saying the same of much else.

A brilliantly crafted war game with an elegant card system. A closed deck where almost all cards (which thematically represent events) will see play, but it's how and when they see play that greatly affects how the game plays out. Sometimes you will need to make tough choices to give benefits to your enemy, but it's how you manage that impact and how you implement the card to also help you. The area control aspect is tension filled, with different ways to try and outdo your opponent in a given area. The DEFCON track also adds a lot of thematic tension. I love how the game begins to shift as DEFCON does, shutting down areas of the map to big change and potentially slowing your opponent's advance. There is so much choice, so many strategic avenues, and the scoring cards even add an element of bluffing that again adds to the thematic 'cold war' tension.

For me, this is plainly the most thrilling board game I have ever played. The theme dominates this mechanicly rather simple game on every level, which I absolutely love. What makes this game my all time favorite though is the high level of suspension which just refuses to flatten down over the course of the game. You never stop facing tough trade-off decisions that have deep consequences in the short as well as in the long run. It can sometimes take 6 hours to finish the Cold War, but they feel like minutes for you never stop being involved. If you have a regular playing partner that likes epic and sometimes very long struggles, just reach for this. You won't regret it! 

Be warned, though: It can be very luck dependent at some times, which can be annoying in a game that long.

Note: My play count on this is way beyond 10 or so, I just didn't regularly log on BGG at this time :)

Twilight Struggle is our Friday night game. Any time my husband and I get a Friday to ourselves, we grab some beer and immerse ourselves in the Cold War. This is the perfect long game, with enough complexity and depth to keep us entertained for hours and probably the best theme integration I've ever see in a game. The VP board is a particular stroke of genius; it ramps up the tension and creates the feeling of a gripping game of tug-of-war. Victory after such a grueling battle is truly sweet. The cards pose interesting strategic decisions, and the rules are surprisingly easy to learn. Overall, a truly great "event" game.

For whatever reason, it took me a long time to get this on the table. Watching it rise to No. 3 in the BGG rankings certainly let to a lot of anticipation, and also likely contributed to some of the disappointment I felt playing this (second edition) for the first time (late in 2010). Don't get me wrong ... I like the game. I just didn't love it, and really thought I would. I've played (and very much enjoy) 1960: The Making of the President and, as advertised, the games are similar. However, I did not feel the same delicious angst about which cards to play in TS as I did in 1960. And while playing 1960, things always seemed pretty balanced, while in TS it becomes quickly apparent that this is a card game with huge swings of luck. As an example, I played one game (as America) in which I drew four scoring cards in the first two rounds of play. So, nearly one-third of my actions were taken up by forced play of score cards while Russia, which has a huge early edge to begin with, used those turns to further consolidate its position and benefit from the next scoring card. That's a pretty vicious cycle for the U.S., and I can't help but think it could have been handled better by the designer. In the final analysis, I liked Twilight Struggle and will gladly play it again, but I did not find it to be the elite game its ratings would imply and will likely trade my copy.

USA squares off against The Soviet Union over 40 years to determine the fate of the world in this Cold War classic.  The thing that makes this game so phenomenal in my mind is the tension that comes with every action you take.  The game has a final scoring after 10 rounds, but there are 3 ways to instantaneously win/lose the game before then.  It just creates this fascinating level of tension and punch/counter punch all game long.  Even if you don't like the theme, if you're into more serious games you'll probably like the mechanic.

Full of theme. Hard decisions to make from beginning to end.

RATING: 10
The title of the game is apt -- playing it is truly a struggle.  Not with the game itself, which has refreshingly simple mechanics that (apart from the event cards) contain few rules exceptions, but a struggle with your competitor.  This is as it should be.  Just an amazing mental tug-of-war every step of the way, with just the perfect amount of luck (and bad luck) to bring the drama.

The theme is perfectly captured as well.

My only issue with the game, and it's really an unavoidable one with this kind of design, is that those who are familiar with some of the more swingy event cards will have a huge advantage over someone with less familiarity.

RATING: 10
If only I could find opportunities to play this more often.  The tension is constant, because you never feel in any control.  There are too many things you want to be doing and you are always forced to make tough choices, and that is even before you add in trying to anticipate and counter what the opponent is doing. I like looking for ways to make the most of the cards you are dealt. The theme stands out and adds extra feel to the game. An excellent challenge.

RATING: 8
I've played it three times now and have thoroughly enjoyed each playing. Every card play presents a tough decision and the opportunity for a clever manuever. The theme is spot on, the mechanics smooth, and it inspires as much laughter as tense muttering. I would rate this game even higher if it weren't for the amount of damage a string of bad dice rolls can cause you in the space race, realignments, and certain "Gotcha!" cards.

RATING: 9
What I really like is the thematic feel of the game plus the history lessons it gives you while playing it. I love the art, the components and the board (Deluxe edition) 

What I didn't really appreciate was the long game time. It was six hours for my first game (and for my opponent it also was almost like a first session). Now, a long gaming time just by itself usually isn't something that puts me off, but a game this length shouldn't depend this much on luck of the draw or wild swings due to either lots of luck or bad luck on the dice rolls. My opponent drew very unfortunate cards for him one round which he almost completely had to play for me. In the end I utterly destroyed him. Maybe it was a superfortunate and highly unlikely constellation for me in this game, but really: in a game this long this mustn't happen. 

After my second game (that took a completely different course) i must say, I still enjoy this, the theme,the anxiousness and the whole presentation of the game. But I'm a little surprised this is the No.1 on the geek. While your regular Top 10 title features planability and economic engine building,this one depends quite heavy on draw of the cards. It's really essential to the game when a card is drawn and who draws it. That means when you get certain cards or if an opponent draws a card that's good for you (and then invests it into the space race). And the dice factor in realignment rolls and coups is also crucial First game I won with the U.S. at the end of the game. Easily, no endgame-scoring was in favor of the Russians! Second game I lost with the U.S. in round 5 of the game. Next, the person I played against tells me he won his next game with the U.S. in round 5, admitting that cards were heavily in his favor. Now there's some really, really wild swings here and usually that would be criticized vigorously. However, TS gets through with it. 
-----
Next game in:let's give it an 8. The tension is nearly unbearable. And once again the session was different. We didn't quite finish but I'm sure it would have come down to the final scoring after round 10.

If I were to rate the design of TS, it would be just shy of a 10. But I'm going by the BGG scale, and this game just isn't for me!

Great theme but we always miss play this game. There always seems to be a rule that we missed. It takes quite long to play. I have had a good time the few time I have played it. I would like to play it more.

update: The gamemechanics is a little too random for my taste. Played two games with me winning the first game by i far margin and the opposite the next game due to luck/lack of luck.

Deep and highly competitive game of influencing allies and enemies during the Cold War. Card driven, so even turn and action requires the difficult choice of what to use your cards for, as well as strategizing how to minimize the damage every card could cause.

Long, deep two-player games just aren't easy to get to the table.

This has quickly become my favorite game.  The depth and historical drama of a war game, but in a very playable package.  Holy crap, do I love the event cards.  I'm a flavor junkie, and they satisfy me oh so very much.  The gameplay (like the Cold War) is tense from start to finish -- there's several solid chances for reversals of fortune right up to the end.

If I were a religious man, I would thank the gods for giving me a wife who really likes this game.  Life is good!

Currently playing the Deluxe Edition upgrade -- love that mounted board!

RATING: 9
After 10 plays, this is now my favorite 2 player game. Even with knowledge of the cards and what you can expect in the various stages of the war, it still plays out differently every time I play. This game is fantastic. My only complaint would be that this game is hard to teach to new players. The familiarity that experienced players have is almost unsurmountable to new players.

That said... FAVORITE 2 PLAYER GAME EVER!

RATING: 7
I really like the game, but I can see that it will take several plays to learn all of the cards and what sort of strategy to use. Considering the length of the game, that's quite a time commitment. Hoping to get more plays eventually.

Update: After owning this for years, I finally got to play a game (well, a partial game) where is all clicked. The game is tense right from the beginning as you're fighting wars on multiple fronts. Some of the cards felt really swingy, but given this game's prominence, I imagine you have to learn to play around those cards.

Still, I can see how this would be enjoyable and I still want to play a full game of it one of these days.

Struggle by the name ,this is a unique mixture of rules and mechanisms that pushes both players on the edge of their abilities.High level of interaction among the players is perfectly balanced and adds to the tense, without leaving any of players felling cut of from the action at any part of the game.
Probably the best area control game until now.

RATING: 9
I've only played the game 4 times, and lost every time, but there is a lot more going on here than first meets the eye.  The options available for each player during each turn are remarkable and it isn't just "should I play this for points or for event" -- timing becomes far more important, as does figuring out what possible scoring cards your opponent has and bluffing about your own hand.  The rules may be very simple compared to other, recent card-driven games, but the play is actually more complex.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
This game nails everything perfectly. The theme and feel of playing a superpower in the Cold War is spot on, every move feels stressful as you secretly try to navigate a course to victory. The theme is dripping off the cards which are all historical events and are accurately displayed.

The mechanics are just as good, forcing you to play cards in your hand which may trigger events for your opponents. The hand management aspect doesn't get much better than this.

Only complaint is wishing I could play it more often.

RATING: 6
I was incredibly surprised how easy it was to convince my wife to play this game. However, it only went so well. I think I should have waited until I knew the game a bit better in order to streamline the instructional portion of the experience. She does not do well with longer games. After the first turn, I could see the look in her eyes that she was nearly done. So, in an effort to exit while she was still having an enjoyable experience with the game, I decided to stop playing and say we'll play it again later. I'll update when the second opportunity presents itself. It may be a while.

::UPDATE:: After my third unfinished game, I'm giving up on TS. I can see what's great about it. It's just not great for me and my gaming situations. I prefer playing with more than two players. I find it to be just a little too tug-of-war in nature, where I pull on my turn, then you pull on your turn, rinse and repeat for a long time. It just never captured me like I know it has so many others. It is going for trade or sell.

RATING: 7
01/2013 - I got another chance to play this. My appreciation has improved, but I'm also lowering my rating to a 6 due to its length. This is a long game. We played the full 10 turns in 5 hours. I suspect with better knowledge of the cards and mid-war finishes, the 3 hour play time list on the box is realistic. There's was plenty of AP, but it's hard for me to see a way around it for two relative noobs. There's an insane amount of choices and a number of interactions that led us to the forums for answers.

There's also a surprising amount of luck. Single dice rolls for coups, realignments, war cards and space exploration. And then the cards. You can get loaded with your opponents cards, or get humstrung by Quagmire or Red Scare (as the US player). I generally like some luck, but this amount of luck in a longer game gives me pause. With the right mindset, I think you just have to embrace the chaos, and enjoy the challenge.

Any way, all that said, it's still a great game. There's a lot of tough choices. It's particulary grueling trying to plan out the play of enemy cards to minimize their negative effects. I look forward to playing it again...

09/2012 - My first play was underwhelming, but it didn't help that I got creamed very early. Based on its rating and my like of the designer, I will be happy to give it a couple more opportunities.

RATING: 8
+ Wonderful tension throughout the game stemming from the dual nature of the cards and the somewhat unpredictable timing of scoring.

+ Extremely interesting theme - to me. Did not appeal to others I played with.

+ Steep learning curve that seems to reward multiple plays.

Long play time for the complexity level of the game. Would likely come down with repeated play.

- Dice rolling to resolve destabilization action - terrible, frustrating mechanic.

- Terrible component quality. The unbacked paper map was particularly bad.


Traded away because I could not get anyone to play another game with me after the first. Would enjoy playing again should the opportunity arise.

RATING: 8
I don't know who it was that said it, but "Cold War in a Box" sums it up. I don't even feel like the word "theme" is even appropriate here... there is no theme, there is just the subject--just the cold war, emulated in card board components and cards, with an abstraction layer ("game") that ties everything together. It's history that seems to be given life through the simple mechanics.

Not short at all as some might suggest. Playable in a night, yes, but you need to dedicate most if not all of that night unless you are well versed in the rules and able to bang out a game in an hour or so. (a night to me is like 2-4 hours tops). It's certainly not long on the wider spectrum, but short is misleading.

I've barely worked my way through the rules but I'm already impressed like going to a fine restaurant, sitting at the bar, watching and smelling them make my food and as it's hitting the plate knowing it will be something truly special. The plate has just been sat down before me, and I'm just waiting to dig in! 

Rating will likely go up.

Everytime I play this I want to play it again, but It doesn't get too much play due to it being hard to find time and another player to play with.

The BGG "meanings" of the ratings don't really convey my opinion of this game. It's a fine game. Interesting enough, playable, but really just a dressed up game of checkers.

An extremely clever design and game that will lend itself to multiple plays with endless degrees of difference in its many twists and turns. Its obviously been well tested and thought out before publishing as there seems to be nothing in the way of errata or contentious cards. Something quite rare these days. I did own this (1st ed.) some years back but offloaded it before finding anybody to play. Now that I have played, its easy to see why so many people love this game.

Letter Grade: A.  Opaque? Yes.  Long?  Yes.  Dismissive of casual gamers?  Entirely.  But it is the premier example of a CDG that I have had the opportunity to play. [05-08-09]

[05-08-09] Old rating: 8.5.  New rating: 9.  I have now played 1960 about three times more than I have played Twilight Struggle.  I will always get more plays of 1960 in, but I appreciate Twilight Struggle just a bit more.  It's maybe more appropriate to say that I fear Twilight Struggle.  Infuses a wargarmery card-driven system with paranoia, global situational awareness, knowledge of history, grand scale, buckets of tension, and theme, theme, theme. I'm not sure it will ever be an all-time favorite, but every single game is memorable.

Rock solid 2P CDG.  Great game to introduce people to CDG games without have tons of rules, counters and armies moving around.  If you have any interest in the Cold War you will enjoy the thematic aspects that are built into the game.  The only downside (and it might not even be a true issue) is that familiarity with the deck will give you a tremendous advantage strategically, so new players may have a hard time.

Excellent game. The more I play it the more I enjoy it. 

I had the first edition and gifted or traded it away a while ago. Received the newest edition as a Christmas gift, and wow is it gorgeous! Definitely a keeper.

UPDATE:

I still like this game. But it feels more like work, and it takes a lot of mental strain to get through a game when the play is very tight. Is that a bad thing? No. Does it mean perhaps I need to step away and come back to it later? Yes. Frustrating loss after frustrating loss to better players has taken some of the shine off, but it hasn't broken my desire to play this game or ruined what I ultimately think of it.

Let me just say that when I heard of twilight struggle I was very sceptical. First it was a war game which I haven't ever tried (unless risk counts), second it was based in the Cold War, which I knew nothing about and I thought couldn't possibly be interesting and lastly that it looked like an over convoluted version of risk. 
Oh boy was I wrong.
I only gave it a second chance after seeing it was gaining almost universal praise everywhere. I thought I'd look into it and found it might be slightly interesting and I also needed a proper two player board game (playing a game meant for 5 with 2 doesn't work very well). I went to buy it and found that it was sold out everywhere and out of print. This only helped its case more. I thought if it is sold out and is number one on bgg then it is doing something right. It took over four months for the board game to go back into print and then to my discovery they were selling it at $100 each. I thought that's a rip, I payed less for Agricola for goodness sake. But after much thought I ended up buying it anyway as I didn't want to regret it further down the track.
When I got home I opened it immediately and read the instructions. All three of my worries disappeared almost instantly afterwards and I actually got excited to play this game. I tried a test run with myself and thought wow this is actually really fun even by myself.
I then tried it with another player a few days after and oh sweet baby Jesus was it glorious. We ended up playing it 3 times that day before we had to stop for a break.

Having said that I thought it was fun in the first game but I got beaten easily and in my mind wasn't worth $100. We then tried a second time switching roles and I got dealt a hand of all soviet cards (I was America). The game then clicked and I smiled, the first time feeling happy I was in a bad position in a board game. I finally understood the game, it wasn't a risk knockoff nor a crappy game with a historical theme, it was really a simulation of the Cold War disguised as a game. Every single event in the game really happened and if the soviets chose to do something slightly differently, like focusing on Iraq instead of Poland, then it would have changed the course of history.

The amount of effort and thought that went into this game boggles me and I am truly amazed at how well it all came together. They managed to make me feel like Stalin in charge of deciding where to place his troops in the world, it made me feel like a person gone back in time to change what events occurred and when, but best of all, it made it fun.

No other game has this much thought and effort put into it, yes there are other more complex, strategic war games out there, but in the end no one's thinking about them as Twilight Struggle is that good.

Sheena didn't like this one.  I want to like it more than I do - I think the issue is the game takes too long to play which makes the fun factor to game time ratio too low.  I think if I played more often and knew what all the cards did by memory it would play much quicker and be more enjoyable - but this isn't likely to happen with my decent-sized collection.  Plus, as I said, Sheena doesn't like it, and she's my main gaming partner.

The Cold war in 3 hours.

Elegance, great theme, tough decisions. That's all that's needed in the end. TS has it all. It's the definition of easy to play hard to master extremely immersive experience. The fact that it manages to capture the spirit of its theme while remaining politically neutral is a nearly unbelievable achievement for me.

If you are even remotely interested in the cold war or world politics as a concept you're going to love this game. Even if you're not, even if you absolutely hate the idea of simulating violent coups, ardent propaganda, bloody wars, dirty spying and nuclear devastation, chances are that TS may still become your guilty pleasure.

RATING: 8
A game full of tension and of difficult decisions, which I love. The atmosphere of the cold war is beatifully rendered, the actual course of events less so. The Soviets are in particular too strong for the balance of the game and compared to the history of the period (the US was the dominant power and the extent of the "Sovient Empire" is largely superior to reality in the game).

That said, the mechanic of letting the opponent play his associated events is litteraly genius. It renews completely the CDG genre by doing this.

The game, I suspect, has more to do with the "perception" of the Cold War by the United States than with the "real" Cold War, but it is still a great game.

The "Chinese Civil War" variant is great, it corrects in part the balance problem in a historical way. I don't think I'll play without it in the future.

Preferred mode of playing : Chinese Civil War Variant + cartes optionnelles. Cela permettrait √† mon sens des parties plus proches de la r√©alit√© historique avec des menaces plus cibl√©es du c√¥t√© sovi√©tique plut√¥t que le rouleau compresseur qu'on voit trop souvent.

RATING: 9.5
This game has really impressed me on the levels of strategy and gameplay it offers. However, the comparisons of this game to [i]1960[/i] are unfounded other than it is a card driven game and both have maps. I've increased the rating on this game because the more I have played it, the more and more I have liked it.

RATING: 5
What I like:

Very historically interesting.


What I do not like

-I hate the card mechanism. The fact that you can be totally ruined by things the game forces you to play. Yes you can remove a few cards with the space program, but if you still have some in your hand, guess what? I'm now gonna spent my turn advancing your situation while you do the same on your turn.
-Way too much randomness for it's game length. I hate when I have to play a game for forever and just have it decided by luck regardless (Much more fun with randomness in shorter/medium length games) 
-Board and gameplay looks and is quite dry


All in all massively overrated, but I do admire and respect the historical accuracy and feel of the game.

RATING: 9
Holy crap!    Really good.  Its true to the theme, as the players feel like heads of state during the era.  Constant paranoia, constant threats.  The rest of the world slowly becomes relevant with advances of technology.  Plays similar to history but not quite, and the not quite is always fun to look at.  Bluffing, reading opponents, thinking and double think, and creating combos.  Everything a good two player game should have.  Easy to sit down and have a relative strategy for round management.  Familiarity with the cards, the player could develop quite the overral strategy too I suspect.  Blissful.   Great theme   great execution = a great time.  I must say I am a truly pathetic US player right now.  The learning curve is fun however, so I can't wait for the next chance. Steep learning curve for the US player.

The Space Race alone is such a cool mechanic.  It so thematic.  It detracts from your development militarily and philosophically, but the prestige involved gives the players benefits for acheiving goals.  That is one example, there are plenty of more clever ideas inside the Twilight Struggle box.  

Theme rarely wins me over.... but in this case.  Wowza!

Of course this has gotten me interested in other CDG's.  I have to quit trying to expand my gaming horizons that make me spend more money.  

Hand Management bliss.

I've been waiting to give this one a go for awhile now.  A guy in our group picked it up and I got to try it out finally.  This game is everything I wanted out of it.  It's a bit cumbersome to learn but once you got the hang of it really is superb.  I'm sure a lot of people who hate dice will hate this game as so many things depend on a die throw and you can get extremely unlucky.  I saw 5 consecutive failed attempts on the Space Race track in one game. After a few more plays I'm still quite pleased with the game but going to take the rating to a 7 instead of an 8 as by the BGG description I think that's more appropriate.

Interesting card-driven wargame that I need to try out more to really be able to rate accurately.  I hope to try it again, but can't really justify the price, especially considering the components -- UPDATE: I enjoyed this a lot more the second time.  I've realized it's not really a wargame, but rather an area control game (like El Grande, especially the K√∂nig & Intrigant expansion since you're playing action cards from your hand in the same manner to gain majorities in as manner areas as possible on the board) dressed up in wargame clothing.  I have even added it to my wishlist now, and am considering raising my rating to 9, but will wait until I have a chance to play it a third time.  The luck didn't bother me as much this time because it seemed to balance out more and I focused on the space race less, although there were certainly a few coup attempts or realignment rolls that had surprising or disappointing results.  I'm looking forward to trying this again hopefully sometime soon, although I'd still love a version of this with nicer components.

About [thing=12333][/thing]:

[b]1) What is it?[/b]
[thing=12333][/thing] is a two players card-driven wargame (some dispute this last part) in which the whole Cold War, from the early war to the late stages of the fight between URSS and USA.

The goal here isn't, however, battles on themselves, but win in the global match. Players are fighting to have presence/control/dominance in each of the continents, doing coups, realigning the political and economical loyalty of countries, spreading influence, racing in the Space War, while trying to really NOT starting a full-fledge nuclear war.

There is a great deal of back and forth, as every card played mess with the board state in some way, from a small nuisance to a complete change of pace and OH MY GOD WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?

[thing=12333][/thing] presents a most solid design, offering completely different play styles and perspectives, accordingly to the nation played. And this is achieved not by giving special abilities or unique decks of card to each side - the pool of cards is the same and so is the rules for both sides.

This battle of wits doesn't play fast (around 180 minutes, but I have seen plays went to almost twice) and has a steep learning curve - not that playing it is terrible difficult, but playing well, and preparing to what will come next, and know (or antecipate) the possibilities for the other side, will take quite a while.

Overall, [thing=12333][/thing] isn't a game one should enter lightly, and but it does offer a strong experience and each game will tell an unique story.

[b]2) How do you play?[/b]
The goal is to reach 20 points during play, or have more points after the final scoring, if the game reaches the end of the final turn in the Late War.

The game is played in several rounds and each round is composed by several turns. In each turn the player must play a card, and most of the the time it will be used it either as an event or for its operation points. If used for the event, the person will do what the text in the card says. If used for the OP, the person will use the number on the card to attempt coups, realignments, increase influence, etc.

Also, each round one card can be discarded in the Space Race.

Finally, some cards will be for scoring. These cards can't be held in hand between rounds - they must be used in the round they are drawn.

Usually the player can keep one card in hand, as the number of turns in a round is less then the number of cards in hand.

If URSS or USA reaches 20 points at any point during the game, the nation that did it will win. If none do during the play, there will occur a final scoring of all the regions, and the nation with the most points will be the winner. It is possible to also end the game by scoring Europe while have Control of it - the nation that controls Europe wins outright.

[b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b]
So many. So, so many. Everything point in the game is truly a decision point. Most revolve around which card to use, when and how. And these have a number of correlations - timming, board state, the connected event, the number of OP, the cards already used and possible cards still in hand, etc - that the tree of decision is huge.

The learning curve is steep, as knowing the deck and the possibilities is key in doing well. Also, since the sides play differently (URSS has more strength early on, USA has more in Late War), is very useful to know when and where to push.

[b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b]
- Excellent design, enough to entertain for many plays, without the need of expansions;
- The theme has a strong presence alongside the mechanics;
- Plays tend to be tense and are able to create a nice narrative each time;
- High replay value;
- Filled with decisions throughout.

[b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b]
- Language dependent;
- Limited to 2 players;
- A more experienced player might be locked and in either usually playing "soft" and not enjoying the experience as much, or crush the opponent, and likely causing some grief;
- In the several plays before actually being able to deal with the cards and be aware of them and the timming of the game, the luck of the draw and of the rolls will not only bother, but can be decisive.

[b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b]
Like being alone in a big kitchen when the restaurant is full and the orders keep coming in. You try to juggle everything: spread influence, battle for control of battlegrounds and countries, stay ahead in the military actions and in the Space Race, be in front in points and ready to score well (or prevent a good scoring) in any region of the globe. But the orders keep coming. There is food burning, and you can see where, but can smell the fire, while some meals are getting cold, waiting for you to make put the dressing or the finishing touches, however you simply can't make it there and not take the meat out of the oven.

You want to do it all, but won't be able. Even more, you might accomplish something somewhere, but at the cost of giving an event that will cost you dearly somewhere else. The balance of power is constantly changing, and you want to always be on top when the right time comes, and, yet, this moment may be up to the decision of your adversary.

Where to focus, where to pressure, where to give. It is relentless. 

Tension reigns supreme in every round - not only because of what you can do, but also due to the limited pool of cards, which brings the knowledge that, if you aren't holding a given card until a certain point, it is definitely in your opponent's hand. And also comes from knowing that, at some point, you will have to give some great events to the enemy and score some places you truly don't want to. Not a game for the faint of heart.

And there will be those that will love this - many do. I, sadly, don't.

[thing=12333][/thing] is a pretty good game, great even, however it demands an investment in learning its ways, to climb the learning curve, until one leaves the "luck" part of it, and I simply won't be able to give what it requires from me, as games of this sort is a one, two plays a year around here. Many people in my group that claim to love it can't play even once a year. Therefore, I fear I will always remain in the level of being bothered by a good roll in a realignment, or in a coup, or in the Space Race - specially when I don't achieve the same. The same works for the drawing of cards. Those that have the experience, can work around these problems, reverse the setbacks and get ready to the troubled times ahead. Yet, I'm not there and likely won't ever be, being destined to mediocrity and frustration.

This puts [thing=12333][/thing], which is already a type of game that doesn't particularly attract me (highly competitive for 2 players), in a situation that I can admire the efficient design, the strong thematic flavor, the tense tug of war, and know it simply isn't for me.

Yet, it might truly be for you. If able, give it a try.

Rated after only 1 play.  Need further plays with better understanding of the rules to really get a hold of it.  However so far I've been underwhelmed.  I guess I had rather high expectations given it's rep here on the geek.  I felt quite frustrated during the game and as though I didn't have many options to control the outcome or at least hinder my opponent.  I also felt the card draw and the dice rolls made it very luck depenant - or least more than I expected.

Played a learning game and damn was that fun

I was the US and the Soviets were spreading everywhere, NASA was out to lunch while the Russians had sputnik, monkeys, and humans in Space, and Vietnam and France went to the dark side.

The Historical aspect of the cards and determining the best of a bad hand was excruciating -  

What a fun ride  - I am itching to play this one again right now...no really, right freakin' now.....

------------------

Played a full game now with a beginner like me so the playing field is equal - we messed up the scoring but had a blast - game went looong but didn't seem it...want to play again...

Instead of letting me use Pope John Paul II, the Russians launched him into space.... (burned the card for the space race) - hilarious!

------------------

Finally got a third game in and we may have actually gotten all the rules right - just beginning to see how important Coups, etc are.....love the game immensely though it is still taking us 5 hours to finish ---- once we get to the 3 hour range it will be perfect.....Moved rating from 9 to 9.5 ---> if time and opponent is right it is the perfect game (at least for those familiar with or growing up in the cold-war era)

RATING: 7
It's probably not fair to rate this game after just one play, but whatever, I'm doing it anyways. My one play so far made me want to play more, to see how much you do is really dictated by the cards and how much is based on experience. I feel like there is definitely a high amount of strategy involved for experienced players, but in my first play at least I caught myself surprised by scoring cards and other opportunities. I feel like I would know much better in my second game what to expect from my opponents and how to make the best of my hands. While it's easy to blame my "bad draws", most of the game definitely felt like there was sufficient control of randomness. The rules weren't as daunting as I imagined, which was a plus. I liked the use of theme, the double-edged sword of most of the cards, and the emerging story. I don't know when I'll ever get to play again, but I look forward to it.

An engaging 2-player game. A lot of strategy involved during the play of the cards. Players have to keep thinking of ways to minimise damage and maximise benefits when dealt with opponent's cards.

Very good game, The only thing that I regret is the absence of real conflict. I often wondered how much better it would be with a series of mini-games for the various wars (in a similar way as the debates work in 1960) for Korea, Vietnam, etc.. that give rewards toward game end.
Those could be played in a less abstract, more wargame-y way...

After playing this game some more times I can safely say that if a game deserves a 10, IMO, this is it. There is luck, yes. There is some really nasty cards that may turn the game one way or another yes. But the tension in every single turn of this game, the historical flavor, the feeling of impending doom (nuclear war), makes it a unique experience. My thanks to the designers for such a master piece.

I'll always love Twilight Struggle for the way its mechanics represent a harrowing time in human history in board game form, using the actual events of that period as in-game events.  That in itself wouldn't matter so much if the game weren't fun to play, which it certainly is.  The trouble is finding the time to play it and an opponent to play it with!

A truly amazing game, it deserves its (current) number 4 rank on BGG. This would have been an easy 9 for me if it wasn't for the fact that I generally don't like wargames (or do particularly well at them either...). The mechanics of TS work wonderfully however, although we still need to do some balancing. It's one of our most thematic games, and the section in the rulebook that explains the background of the cards is a very nice touch. The cards themselves are of excellent design, the board likewise, although the turn progress marker is in a tedious position. But thats a minor. Everything else about TS is great :)

6/6/06: Taking this to a 9. The productions problems deserve to be accounted for. 

3/24/06: Bumping this to a ten. After about 7 plays, I love this game. Playing against opponents who know whats in the deck has increased my appreciation of this one. 

Just the right amount of decisions to make. The theme fits wonderfully here. Once you get a few games under your belt and know the events, the luck element drops out a bit...you learn all the tricky ways to cope with any bad luck brought to you in the cards. I like how the two nations play differently. Soviets need to be agressive off the bat, whereas the Americans need to be a bit more sly.

I finally got to play, was beaten handily by Jeff Martin, still the game is great and I can't wait to play again (I'm sure the next one will go much quicker.)  I had previously played 1960, but I think I like this one better.  The rules of play are a little straighter.  It feels as much like the Cold War as 1960 felt like the Nixon/Kennedy Election! Very nice to play games that connect so closely with history, especially history you actually experienced!

We don't like the central mechanic's frustration--when you use points, you often give your opponent as much benefit or more--combined with the randomness of the cards and the dice. It's very punishing--if you make one mistake or the dice and cards run against you, there can be a rich-get-richer problem. Some games are fun even when you lose; we find this one aggravating. We're giving up on this one indefinitely.

Previously owned. I could appreciate that it was a good design. My brother liked it well enough, but I found it dull, probably because I find the Cold War depressing. My rating is supposed to reflect how I feel about actually playing the game, so my respect for the design doesn't influence it. I can't fault it as a game, but I still don't fancy playing it.

Update (7th March 2012): I purchased the Deluxe Edition today and will give it another go. With so many people liking it, perhaps I didn't give it a fair chance.

Twilight Struggle inherits its fundamental systems from the card-driven classics We the People and Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage. It is a quick-playing, low-complexity game in that tradition. The game map is a world map of the period, whereon players move units and exert influence in attempts to gain allies and control for their superpower. As with GMT's other card-driven games, decision-making is a challenge; how to best use one's cards and units given consistently limited resources?
Twilight Struggle's Event cards add detail and flavor to the game. They cover a vast array of historical happenings, from the Arab- Israeli conflicts of 1948 and 1967, to Vietnam and the U.S. peace movement, to the Cuban Missile Crisis and other such incidents that brought the world to the brink of nuclear annihilation. Subsystems capture the prestige-laden Space Race as well as nuclear tensions, with the possibility of game-ending nuclear war.

A game that I really wanted to love but ended up hating.

The representation of history is just incorrect, imo. But, putting that aside and accepting its Domino Theory PoV, the actual mechanism for it in the game seems weak.

The war concept is ok, but poorly implemented.  I certainly didn't feel when playing like I had to manage a recurring flashpoint in either the Middle East or between India and Pakistan.

The mechanism for Southeast Asia was reasonable, but should have been applied to Eastern Europe as well, where there was both a definite Warsaw Pact core and periphery.

And so on.  The game design feels very inconsistent, even within itself, and like it really needed another round of development.

Great game from a gamist perspective. Really great. but man does it leave you wiped out and worn out, even when you win. Hard to get out on the table.  Nevertheless one of the best 2 player games with the highest replayability I have encountered. Id give it a 10 in terms of mechanics, but a 6 in terms of the actual experience not being especially pleasant. Very much duplicates the feeling of growing up in the Cold War.

Twilight Struggle is an interesting game about US v. USSR during the Cold War. It takes several hours to play. We broke a game of this into two sessions over two days and still struggled to retain enough interest to finish it. It isn't a bad game. Perhaps we will play this again when we get the new version with additional cards.

I first heard about TS by seeing a list of number 1 games at BGG. At that time, TS was numher 1 in three categories.  I decided to get and check it out, since it was so popular.  Also, because I graduated from high shcool and college during the 80s, the late Cold War was an important policial issue during that time that stuck with me.  I really like it.  Because there is a steep learning curve in TS, it is hard for me to find good opponents where I am.  However, the steam version of TS is great and allows me to play with a varity of people.  I have played most of my games against DownRiver Rick.

Este es el juego m√°s tem√°tico al que he jugado y que realmente me hace sentirme en una situaci√≥n de guerra fr√≠a. Es un juego que a pesar de ser largo, la partida se pasa en un suspiro. Me encanta ver c√≥mo se va desarrollando la partida y como la influencia de ambos se expande por todo el planeta. El track de puntuacion me parece muy bueno. Ese tira y afloja hace muy visual la lucha. Adem√°s que estoy aprendiendo un mont√≥n de historia con el juego y es un juego que me invita a investigar por internet los distintos eventos que se produjeron para poder entender mejor el sentido de las cartas.

The Cold War! Man, this game has a lot of atmosphere. The Cold War is the part of history which I find the most interesting, and this game is for me The Complete Experience. Can`t get any better than this. The only things about this game that can be critizised are the components and the warping map. But somehow it also enhances the experience for me, because it sets me back to the 80`s and the Cold War when I played games with only cardboard-counters all the time.

Twilight Struggle can run a little long, but it is one of the best two player games out there. Rounds play fast, it is VERY atmospheric and offers palpable tension. Depending on the cards played, rounds sometimes feel a little bit tit for tat, but most of them offer difficult decisions. Probably gets better with subsequent plays, as intricacies start to show more. A very well designed game and I am looking forward to my next play.

This game's design simply took my breath away when I first played it. While subsequent plays have took the sheen off the novelty, the design is simply brilliant. The card text and play really melds very well with the history of the cold war and the theme came through strongly even though this was a card driven game.

I love the idea of this game. I'm a big fan of Cold War-era politics and spy fiction, so the theme was perfect for me. I love the fact that you're trying to strike a fine balance of reaping your own rewards while softening the punches your opponent's cards force upon you. This game isn't for everyone, however, as it's basically like a 4 hour game of Risk with a heavy political theme. Special mention goes to the Space Race track for being an innovative way to bury potentially-catastrophic cards.

O jogo √© muito bom, completo e dif√≠cil, mas n√£o vejo como "toda essa Coca" a ponto de ser 1o. (agora 2o.) do BBG. T√° certo que a tem√°tica √© √≥tima, o jogo √© tenso, cerebral e te d√° imers√£o total do clima de guerra, mas n√£o est√° entre os meus melhores.
O que mais me afasta do jogo acredito que seja o fator sorte, que a meu ver est√° muito presente, tanto nas cartas compradas quanto nos dados, dois pilares do jogo.
Outra coisa que me incomoda um pouco √©, 50% do tempo, praticamente ser obrigado a executar eventos contra voc√™ mesmo. Isso pra mim √© muito estranho e contra-intuitivo no jogo.
Mas de resto, agrada bastante para quem gosta de jogos de guerra bem orquestrados e historicamente corretos.

RATING: 7
Fun game, easy for non-wargamers to learn, and explores a historical period that doesn't otherwise have a lot of game coverage. This is one of the only card-driven-games where I think the cardplay really makes sense for the topic, rather than just being pasted on to ride the current CDG fad. 

Update: In the 5 years since I wrote the above, this has gone from being a fringe wargame to being the #1 game on the Geek. I'm not sure I get that, honestly. It's fun, and I still enjoy playing it a couple times a year. But it just doesn't grab me like *that*. But there must be something all those other folks love - including my wife, who requests it more than any other game.

The first game took five hours, with the Soviets winning at final scoring.  Game #2 was an hour shorter, and once again the USSR won in endgame scoring (though the US actually spent some time ahead on the VP track this time.)  For at least an hour afterwards, I could think about little besides "when am I going to get to play this again?"

That's when I knew it was a *great* game.  But there is the little matter of the Soviet advantage.  Well, after six games, I finally got the USA to win,  13 at final scoring (and an Iron Lady discarded to Terrorism away from a turn 9 auto-win).  So far I've managed three US wins in ten games (seven as the US)- one at final scoring, one via Wargames on Turn 9, and one on Turn 10 where the Soviets triggered a suicide nuclear war rather than go to a final scoring where I Controlled Europe.  (Chernobyl plus Tear Down This Wall is the Americans' late-war answer to Red Scare plus Blockade, and then some.)  I have yet to lose as the Soviets, but I'm sure it'll happen soon enough- my opponents just need to play the US some more.

After ten plays in less than four months with no sign of slowing down, I'm upping my rating to 9.5- it's still too soon to be sure I'll love this game forever, but it has been played over and over, and I still do always want to play it more.

...

Now that I've had several chances to play the Deluxe Edition: the new cards are a must, and redress most of the US/Soviet imbalance (it's still easier to play the USSR, and is probably worth bidding 1-2 IPs for, but it's a lot closer).  I will never play with the CCW variant though- the mere possibility of a game with no China Card feels very wrong, and would screw with hand management in very unpleasant ways.

If not for the fact that I played this game with a good friend, I would have probably rated it a 2. 
I can't begin to imagine how it ranks so highly on BGG - I would've thought the theme alone would appeal only to a niche audience.  But this 2-player, hugely long, poorly produced box of cardboard chits with an awful 4.7.6 style rulebook straight from the Cold War era itself?  Inconceivable!
With both card draw and dice rolling, the game is very luck based.  Even worse, unlike many good American style games, there's no way of manipulating a bad result through some kind of resource spending or card draft.  The historical events on the cards certainly add to the feeling of the era, but mess with your game play so much, that rather than the leader of a superpower you feel like a mid level bureaucrat with an insane boss.  Hmmm, now that I think about it, the theme IS pretty strong...

The best game to come along in many years. Probably since Diplomacy! Gives you the "feel" of the Cold War. Very replayable, addictive as well.

OK, I got into the game after some time. 
Outside of randomness my second issue with the game is that one needs to remember what are possible events in the game to adjust for them (e.g. it usually doesn't make sense to invest in Japan playing the US side) and I play just too rarely (I even forgot once that dominance in Europe in the end is a win).

After one play I can see a lot of potential in Twilight Struggle. It felt like there is a good amount of luck in the game, with the dice rolls and random appearance of scoring cards, but I can see how this would improve greatly if both the players know the cards well. Even though I wasn't familiar with the cards at all, I still thought the game was quite tense and a good simulation of the Cold War. I actually won as the U.S. with 25 victory points during the first headline phase after the mid-war cards were shuffled into the deck. The U.S.S.R. player was concentrating on the instant victory for Europe scoring and I barely survived and managed to rack up points in Asia, scoring it twice. I am sure this was just a fluke, though. I am definitely looking forward to trying this again.

I had great expectations about this game! Sadly, it was not what I expected. As it is with all card-driven games, one must get over the learning curve (meaning learning the cards) and personally I don't have the time to invest to this (specially for a 3-hour game). Admittedly I have only 2 plays, but I would rather spend 3 hours on a game that I know (and I know I'll enjoy it), rather this one.

I'll always play it, but I'll probably always suggest 1960 over it (partially because I feel guilty launching coups all over the neutralist world regardless of what faction I play...)

It's also a bit more heavy than 1960, I think-- I was able to teach 1960 to non-gamers ok, but I think the extra die-rolling/fiddlyness of the influence tokens confuses people.

2-player only, a game about the Cold War struggle between the USA and USSR, focused on political influence instead of military tactics.

RATING: 10
Absolutely brilliant game. The theme works really well with the mechanics. It's possible for either player to have a really bad hand in one turn, but that element of luck should even out over the 10 turns a game will usually play. Also my feeling is there's a slight advantage to the Reds in the Early War phase and a slight advantage for the US in the Late War, but it's far from insurmountable for either side. The only real down-side I can think of is that repeated plays will lead to players knowing the places to avoid putting influence as they know an Event could negate all their effort their, which is a shame because of the 'nasty/nice surprise' element of the Event cards when you don't know them all. But I can't really see how that could have been avoided. All in all, I can't see myself ever turning down a game of this, as I know I'll always enjoy it.

I love everything about this game except for the tug of war feeling.  The hand management, the tension, the unique card events, the scoring mechanism, the brinkmanship, and the theme are all great.

Too much emphasis is placed on card memorization. I believe if the early-mid-late war decks were constructed randomly, rather than predetermined, it would go a long way to alleviating this.

Two players play Soviet Union vs. the USA and use events or operation points on cards to increase their sphere of influence around the world. Key mechanism is that events must be played when they belong to your opponent, making the game one that centers around damage control - the experience is thus tight and tense. Low component quality for high price is a major drawback to this otherwise excellent game, especially the flimsy unmounted board. Another potential troublesome design choice is the unbalanced nature of the sides - the USSR player has a much greater chance to win outright during the early turns while the US player plays a more defensive game. Overall, the USSR seems to have as much as a 2/3rd chance of winning, especially with inexperienced players. This can be troublesome for a game that can take upwards of 3+ hours to complete. I think I prefer "1960: The Making Of The President" when playing a 2P card-driven area control game.

A fun 2-player game that requires some time to play and some turn planning.  Rules are a tad confusing until you start to play it.  If you like games such as Risk, you'll like this game.  Very few random elements - mostly dice rolling and which cards are dealt to you.

This is a great game.  I'd rate it higher, but after looking thru several forums it begins to look like a game where card counting/memorization can be a huge advantage.  I understand you need to know what's available for the other player but hate the idea that the other dude can figure possibly figure out what I've got in my hand by looking at what's been played.  Still as long as I'm not playing a "pro" I'd play this almost any time.

Quel bon jeu historique. Un m√©canique simple. M√™me si le jeu a peu de profondeur (ce sont toujours les m√™mes strat√©gies qui reviennent), il reste tactique car il faut s'adapter aux d√©veloppements de la partie et √† la r√©alit√© du terrain. Le jeu comporte une part de hasard contr√¥l√© et cela colle √† la r√©alit√© historique. Souvent les √©v√©nements peuvent balancer d'un c√¥t√© comme de l'autre avec peu de chose (la chance, le timing). En ligne.

I don't think we'd ever consider this until we start playing Hannibal regularly.

Grant has a copy.

I'm not really sure about this one and not sure why.  I was psyched after reading the rules, but that didn't hold through the rest of the game.  Maybe it's the subject matter, or maybe it requires memorizing another deck (which at my age isn't going to happen).

And I definitely find the board play (the control system) to be a bit off.

[i]"Fair. Some fun or challenge at least, will play occasionally if in the right mood."[/i]

I like this a lot but USSR can feel  futile in the last hour of the game, while  being beaten quickly as the US can feel unsatisfying.

Edit: Dropped again, it's interesting as an alternate history generator but the extreme variance is off-putting some times. It is at least never boring.

Twilight Struggle is a historical two-player game where players take sides in the 60's cold war between America and the Soviet Union. I've played once and it was a lot of fun and a well-made game. The drawback is that it takes too long, and I don't like games that last over an hour, but the exception is with two-player games, as you can easily quit or adjourn the game to be continued on another day if you get restless or tired of playing.

Not to be confused with the more popular "Twilight Imperium" game which is an absurdly long all-day game that I'd never play, nor with those ridiculous teeny-bopper vampire films.

Anyone who considers themselves a gamer needs to try this game. Great tension, great theme, bluffing, history and replayability. My only two caveats are the following: (1) It's a typical GMT game in terms of components. The cards are sturdy and the cardboard counters are perfectly functional. But it's not really pretty to look at. (2) While it's easy to learn, it's hard to master. You'll probably need to start by playing other newbies because you won't be much of a challenge to an experienced player.

Outstanding game that oozes theme. After a hundred or so plays, I can attest that despite the depth of strategy and meaningful decisions, there are plenty of games where a player will get blown out of the water by a series of terrible hands and crap die rolls. From both sides, that makes it pretty unsatisfying compared to some better games (Sekigahara, Maria, Napoloeons Triumph, etc.)

Everybody says it's great, and they're right.  This is one of those games that I find myself thinking about a lot even when I'm not playing it, dreaming up new strategies, tactics, and tricky card combos. Getting the gestalt feel to really plumb the depths of its strategy took several plays, but I can say that the journey was well worth it.  Theme is fantastic, and the cards are well chosen and balanced.  I wasn't thrilled with the components in the first couple editions, but the deluxe version really helps with this, particularly with the mounted board.  Really tense, in a delicious way.

First of all - it's not worth it's price. For 200 PLN (~50EUR), You would suspect much better quality of board (too thin, askew when placed on the table) and counters. It's hard to describe, but after opening the box, You feel disappointment and You keep asking - why it was so expensive ?

Second of all, I'm disappointed with amount of luck involved. Bad card drawing and couple of dice rolls (especially with coups) can leave You loosing, with not much You can do about it. Sometimes I fell out of the control playing this game.

(9/08)  After playing 1960 earlier in the day - we moved on to my 2nd 2p card driven game.  Glad that I started with 1960 and moved "up" a notch to this one.  Enjoyed my first play and look forward to more plays as I get to "know" the deck of cards better.  Enjoy the early/mid/late war cards and how the balance shifts from USSR to USA throughout the game.  Not a huge jump for Euro gamer to try either of these 2 games.

My wife and I have only played one game so far, but I can tell that this will be a game that I will enjoy for several years to come.

Once I have become more familiar with the cards and gotten more games under my belt, I am sure that my rating will increase.

RATING: 7
Un 7 per l'idea e l'aspetto culturale, giocato invece competitivo perde interesse √® un gioco di carte come un altro.

Non capisco chi mi dice che ci gioca in 1 ora, non ci riuscirei nemmeno volendo. Consiglio di giocarlo con calma magari dividendo il gioco in 3, una serata a periodo di guerra. Interessante il fatto di leggere il riassunto storico delle carte in fondo al manuale mentre si gioca per prendersi delle pause. Gioco particolare che ovviamente ha bisogno di + partite per imparare bene le carte, il loro effetto sul tabellone e periodo, in modo da abbassare l'alea ed essere preparati.

Luca Iennaco say:

It's not a wargame, but a fiddly area-majority game driven by cards and resolved with dice.
Probably more appealing to wargamers or those not minding if, after 3 hours, the outcome will be determined by a die roll in the last action of the last turn (happened thrice to us).

Theme is original and interesting, but gameplay is very random. You roll dice to: realign, coup, the space race, several events (all the Wars, Quagmire/BearTrap, Summit, Olympics...); that's pretty much everything you can do in the game except for placing influence.
Distribution of cards can screw you (because you get cards of low value or the opponent gets those with high value or you get only those associated with his events or all these together!) or help you a lot (reverse the examples).
Handling the events of the opponents would be the most interesting part, if it weren't often pretty obvious (play last those with effects "until end of turn", use the Space Race, the ONU and the "held option" to neutralize the most dangerous, etc.).
After you know the cards, you'll start to play around them (knowing that Cuba will be taken by Fidel, etc.).
The overall result is that you don't feel rewarded by your decisions, but driven to a random outcome by the dice and cards.

There are some production issues: 
-) you'll need something to replace control markers (e.g. wooden cubes) as they are overlapped and thus cannot be read (alternatively you'll need to inspect stacks of counters every few actions); 
-) it's quite uncomfortable to determine the degree of control you've in each region (and since this is crucial to scoring, you'll need to do it often);
-) some cards aren't clear enough;
-) errata corrige issued about cards and setup (and constantly evolving...);
-) some spelling errors.

Average game length for us: 3 hours.
Expensive.

UPDATE: Still never been played through. It's a game that needs to be played several times to learn the cards for maximum benefit. Problem is that this takes 3 hours per play so you've got to commit to perhaps 15 hours of play time (five plays) before fully understanding the game. What's more, these 15 hours aren't terribly good fun because you don't know the best strategies. They are an exercise in chit pushing.

There's a real feeling of "If I'm going to commit to spending 15 hours playing a heavy head-to-head game of skill, why aren't I just playing 15 hours of Go or YINSH? At least the 15 hours of learning time would be fun, and I'd be able to find a fair few opponents afterwards.

****

* UPDATE: Has never got played. I'm just never in the mood for this game. If I want a three-hour epic game, I prefer Mage Knight or even Eclipse. It has about six months to get played before it'll get traded.

Played half a game so far (I got ill and stopped). From play so far, it's obviously a great game, extremely tactically heavy with lots of options and a historically fascinating theme. A big thumbs up!

UPDATE: Re-bought a copy of the game. I realised from reading BGG threads that the USSR (played by me) wasn't placing the US under pressure early enough in the game.

Less a wargame and more an area control game, this still has some really nifty mechanisms and some neat interplay with the cards.  The way that the different eras of the war are separated into different decks, with the possibilities of events repeating themselves, really captures the historical feel of the Cold War, even if all you're really doing is trying to take over certain regions of the board in time to score them.  It's easy to get caught up in the cards as actions instead of ops points, and that's a sure sign to a loss.  I think there is the potential for a ton of replayability in this game, and I only wish it didn't take so blasted long to play.  My second play of the game lasted 2.5 hours longer than a 3-player game of Through the Ages.

Perfect tension and the map is a beautiful representation. The game designers did a wonderful job in trying to convey the probable feelings of what the leaders more than likely felt at the time periods that this game covers.

Each game I learn more and more of what is going on. I think it's the only game that I've played that can last anywhere from 30minutes to 6 hours. Extremely variable in play time, though more than likely it runs close to 4 hours.

[1st edition] Very good blend between a wargame and an area control eurogame, and thematically very attractive. Maybe some problems in the first few games, when the Soviet side seems to be easier to play. With some hand-made additions/modifications (control marker stones, alternate space race track, errata correction) it rates even higher, but the actual rating that I give is strictly the vote for the game out of the box.

[Deluxe edition] The deluxe edition fixes most if not all problems with sub-par component quality of the previous editions, so it goes up one point in rating (9).

To me this is the first game that truly puts (me a child of the 60's), the Cold War in perspective. We were too young to know about 'Nam other than it interrupted our cartoons, yet we felt there was a menace out there. Awesome.

If you're interested in the history of the Cold War, this is a must-have!

But, it's not all about the theme. The game mechanics are well suited to the subject, creating lots of tension. Not a wargame in the sense of dice, CRTs, armies, and weapons. And yet, definitely a strategy game that will appeal to wargamers and those who like area control games (El Grande).

There is so much history in this box that I'd probably love it even if the game was mediocre. Luckily, it's not. The design appeals to both wargamers and Euro lovers, card gamers and TCG duelists. The hand management features are fascinating and the random order of events make every game an exciting romp through the alt-history Cold War.

Twilight Struggle is absolutely as good as its rating indicates and I have to say that this is a game that belongs in every heavy gamer's collection.  It  also should be taken for a test drive by more middle of the road gamers since it's not quite as difficult as it looks.

I played 1960 first, and while I did like this one slightly better, it still isn't something I'd go out of my way to play. I really like that there are multiple win conditions, the tug of war VP track is a really neat concept (both mechanically and thematically), and the wargameishness of things like the ways in which influence spread felt very intuitive to me. On the other hand, the dice irritate me in a game of this depth, and I feel frustrated by the inability to mitigate a bad hand (a bad card or 2, yes, but I often find myself doing more good for my opponent than they are and vice versa).

The big strength of this game is the theme. I like how the game makes your opponent think certain areas are very important when you do stuff there, much like the cold war. In general a good game, I don't like how important some of the dice rolls can be and I don't always have the time for such a long game.

I absolutely love this game and am proud to rate it a 10. It's complex enough for deep strategic play, but doesn't take the entire day to do so. Just about the right length for me. Easily the best two-player game I've ever played. Probably the best game I've ever played. I'm a history buff, so I love the cards alone. The game has lots of tension and I love how one player is always paranoid about what the other player is planning....kind of like the Cold War I guess.

After a couple of plays I can tell this is going to be a long term classic. Due to the cards, this is going to be a game that improves the more you play it. Knowing the cards and how they work off each other is crucial. If you play this, give it a few runs before passing judgment.

RATING: 9
Wow, this is a game. When I know the cards better I might even rate it closer to my favourite card game... It's tense all the way through, with tricky decisions where you are trying to second guess your opponent and keep one step ahead. At first it feels like luck plays an important part, but every time I do badly, I realise that I could have played much better. This is going to be a hard game to master, and I'm looking forward to traveling further down this path...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Quite a game here. Not without a few warts (some cards are neither balanced nor enjoyably quirky), but overall a great success. And...my wife sorta likes it, but her initial glow has faded in proportion with bouts of chaos and luck. The decisions are tough and interesting, but how meaningful they are depends a lot on things outside of either player's control, and sometimes that just isn't fun, esp. in a game of this length (and for casual players, it's long).

Second edition is nice, esp. the new influence counters, which are non-essential, but a nice touch. The map never bothered me, and the card changes are (somewhat unfortunately) pretty minor overall.

Deluxe is also nice, but again, non-essential. The map still wants to warp a bit.  The rounded, thicker counters are better, and of course having some optional cards is a good thing.

As I have already played Campaign Manager many times (and very much enjoyed it), learning this game was not a huge leap.  There are certainly more choices to make, but that is what makes this game so much more deep.  After first play, I could see Twilight Struggle becoming one of my favorite games due to the direct interaction and many decision paths.  Initial rating: 9

Lots to orchestrate and many different strategies.  Dice rolling adds a bit of randomness, but it still works for me.  More plays now and moving rating to 10.

After some more play, I think the rank will settle at 9.  The dice randomness is a bit of a problem.  I prefer the cube bag used in 1960 as a way to add biases but not complete randomness.  The length of TS is a bit of a turnoff as well.  I'd would generally rather play 4 really good games in the time it takes to play 1 TS game, but really enjoy TS for scratching a particular itch the others do not.

Update: Knocking ranking down ONLY because of the time commitment involved.  1960 gives you a similar play in half the time.

Only average game - I had big expectations but got comparably disappointed. Cards look flavored and there's really a sense of struggle on the map as you play. However it doesn't impress at all - all boils down to just putting influence counters on a fixed map (minus for replayability), and timing scoring cards. Luck plays important role too, as there's single die rolls in various cases, and card values also differ greatly, so having some lead in card luck you can also swing overall balance in your side (as some half of scoring card points goes to player just having more, no matter difference).

I finally got the chance to play this new number 1 of BGG.
In short: very good but too long !
In detail: the impression is of a very good game, accurate in every detail.
The historical love poured in is tremendeous. If i truly were a history expert i would say it is terribly accurate on the historical side.
Rules are pretty detailed actually but after a while u get the most important points and then u need to play it a lot to shorten the time play, learn all the cards and explore the seemingly infinite way to play.
I kept confusing the coups and the realingments but this is just a problem with me!
The game lasted more than 4 hours and i never perceived to think more than a minute to each move: this is the only big downside of the game. I am not looking forward to playing again for 4 hours to one single game.

I don't think it is the best game around but it surely is a very good one

RATING: 8
My first true wargame. I enjoyed it, short of the randomness the space race provided. Scoring distribution seems a little clunky as one player may consistently receive all of the first three rounds' scoring cards providing a large boost in the first couple of rounds. That may be alleviated by an observant opponent, but I and my gaming bud haven't hit that level of sophistication yet. Getting ahead in space seemed pretty huge too, but again, with more plays under the belt, that could change.

Two player, card driven war campaign.  Manage area control with military coups, play disruptive current event cards, advance in the space race.  Hopefully without losing control of the DefCon level triggering nuclear war. Interesting dynamic to add heat in this Cold War re-enactment with a penalty if you do not engage with enough military operations.  The extended example in the rules was an invaluable way of understanding how to play (despite a couple of printed mistakes).

I have now played TS a dozen times, with several different people.  It is a 10.  TS is meaty enough to satisfy somebody like me who enjoys real depth in games.  The theme is fascinating - the Cold War was a critical period, and could have gone very badly for the world.  Trying to avoid nuclear annihilation is a key part of the game - if you start it, you lose.  

The mechanics of the game are very simple.  You can teach a newbie and play the game in a three-hour session.  (Which I consider short!)  

But simple rules don't make the game simple.  Dealing with various events popping up all around you - events being played, and your opponent's attempts at coups, etc - keeps you on your toes.  

The scoring card mechanism is very interesting.  The advantage of holding a scoring card (and you hope playing at the right time) is discounted by the fact that you hold one fewer useful card in your hand.  (And having THREE in your hand at once can be BRUTAL!)

A classic.  If the scale went to 11, that's what I'd give it.

RATING: 10
Ok, I'm going up to 10 because I am addicted to this game. Also, I realized that the luck of the draw is not as strong as I had originally thought, because the quality of your events will be mirrored by the quality of your opponent's events. However, I am still concerned that there is too much luck, with single die rolls often being worth double-digit VP swings.

A single deck CDG that plays fast! Sounds a lot like We The People, which is one of my favorites. Solid game with a twist in that the Event/Ops decision is further complicated by the fact that your opponents events trigger if you play them for OPS. Rating likely to go up. Didn't. Rating went down. My primary complaint is that the cards you and your opponent are dealt will have far more impact on how the game turns out than how you manage the play of those cards...

Awesome game for heavy, tactical gamers. Rates a 6 if you aren't into heavy games because you might still enjoy a play but you'll also probably be overwhelmed by all of the rules and all of the card variety.

What I liked:
-The asymmetry of the two countries and how the US starts at the disadvantage and has to fight just to survive in the beginning.
-The incredible depth of tactics and strategy.  Each card has multiple possible uses, and there are multiple long-term strategies players can take on and off the board.
-Great balance of strategy/determinism and Luck/RNG, leaning more heavily towards the strategy/determinism but plenty enough RNG that you are kept on your toes and second-guessing yourself.

What I didn't like:
-It's intimidating when you first see the game.  The sheer number of components and types of components is a lot to take in and sort through.  
-There is a steep learning curve.  Even having a friend who knows the game teach it to you, I made a lot of mistakes.

TL;DR
Fantastic game, I'm excited to play again.  Expect a steep learning curve, and if it's your first time, watch videos ahead of time and expect it to take a minimum 2-3 hours.

I love this game. I love it when lady luck looks you straight in the eye... before she spits in it. I love it when things go (sometimes unexpectedly) swimmingly. The to, the fro's and in between. The back, the forth..ups, downs..sometimes sideways...this is what makes a game for me - fun. UPDATE:As of April 07 I have played this game 9 times. Sure there's a bit of luck with unexpected dice events but ya gotta take the good with the bad..this is a great game at this stage and I'm sure will be destined to be a classic.
UPDATE 200211 I'm going to move this game down fractionally. I still think it's a great game, I think with some of the other recent games I've acquired (Washingtons War, Julius Caesar,Napoleon's Triumph) and some of the goldie oldies (hammer of the Scots, Napoleon 1815) I am often torn whether to play this game or another. My most recent game seemed a close match but I ended it by playing war games in the late war, even though things felf like they were slipping away from me in mid to late game. It seemed like a very deflated way to end a game you've spent 3+ hours of investment by one sole card that says, hey if you've got more than 6 vps lead you win the game (and defcon is at 2).

Twilight Struggle is good because it does two things well: (1) it covers a dramatically underrepresented niche in the wargaming community, and (2) it does so in a mechanically clever and appropriate manner.

If you want your Twilight experiences to be enjoyable ones, though, be sure to track down players of your own experience level.  Either that, or take the time to learn the cards backwards and forwards before facing a master.

I prefer the maneuvering and combat of block games, myself.  So CDGs only get occasional play, even when they're the cream of the crop.

Played once. I am not familiar at all with card-driven wargames but was eager to try one - especially this one, after having hear much praise, as well as comments regarding how it was not really a wargame. I have been quite satisfied with my first play (even though I lost on turn 8 - but then I was playing against an experienced player). Of course, you need to know the cards to play well (although the theme can help you guess what might happen), but that had to be expected. I am a bit more concerned with the importance of dice rolls - they are not that numerous, which means that a single result can have important consequences (and a few early bad rolls on my side did not help during my only play). Still, I would gladly play it again - I found it was quite enjoyable, even though (or because?) it was different enough from the German-style games I am more familiar with.

A very good card-driven political influence game.  After my first couple of plays, I was a little annoyed with the game because it seemed like the only way to do well was to know the deck very well.  That may still be true, but I've gotten over it.  The variety of events in the deck is what really evokes the Cold War feel of the game and the constant need to put out fires while pursuing your own agenda.

I played this before I played 1960, and after my first play of 1960, I thought I would like that game better.  A couple more plays of 1960 convinced me that there is more depth and variety in this game than that one.

I own the deluxe edition and think that it is a great version of the game.

Love it! Tons of strategic depth without a ton of rules and exceptions.

Theme is something that is low on my priorities when it comes to games. Where them is make or break for some people, I can look past a pasted-on theme and enjoy a game for its mechanics and other redeeming qualities. Twilight Struggle is the game that enlightened me to what theme can bring to a game. Despite not caring, the perfect implementation of theme in Twilight Struggle is a masterpiece. On top of theme, the tension and excruciating decisions this game throws at you make it exciting every time.

Easy to learn and probably hard to master. A good knowledge of the events is probably playing to the advantage of the more experienced player. The randomisation of the hands of cards is a bit frustrating when nothing seems to fit one's design, but it should even out in the long run. Military operation count is a nice way to keep players on their toes because it can be an easy way to add VP.
It is definitely a strategy game worth trying and practicing.

A player who knows the cards and their effects has a significant advantage over someone who doesn't.  And knowing the cards makes you play in non-thematic ways.  (For example, historically, the US should be trying to influence Cuba in 1950.  But knowing that the Castro card is in the later mix, it's stupid to do so.)  Interesting mechanics, but not enough to overcome the game's flaws.

Great game. Constant action and changes of the lead. Very tricky hand management, because cards can help you a little but your opponent a lot, and you are forced to play them.

That said I think it's a little "nichey" to represent the #1 game on here. A 2-player only, cold war themed, card-driven "wargame" is the BEST game? There are definitely better representations but I won't game the rating because of this. It's a very good game.

I want to love this game and to be honest I do. I played the Americans in the few games I did play and I won a few and then started to lose regularly to the Soviets. It is obvious to truly enjoy this game that one must play many times and really learn the cards and card interactions. I have not been able to do that and I have put it aside while I play other games. That is no criticism of the game. I think it is an excellent and innovative game and the production value is superb (2nd Addition)but I became a bit disenchanted with need to learn the cards. I assume I will at some point dive back into this beauty.

The historical theme of this game was the greatest attraction for me. My Significant Other and I can tell that the designer(s) have spent a great deal of time researching the historical events that form the backdrop of this game.

That it is a two player game and I usually play boardgames with my Significant Other only was also a plus.

We own the deluxe version of the game and the artwork and finish of the game is fabulous. The quality is top notch.

One aspect of the game that we do not quite like is the amount of luck involved, especially the dice throwing involved to decide the outcome of wars and space race. But that is a small complaint for an otherwise excellent game.

I must preface my comments by stating that I just love 2-player games due to how they are a form of direct head-to-head competition, and there is no other players that could possibly king-make or get in the way. Most of my favorites games also fall into the category of conflict simulations and feature direct conflict.

It's hard to find the words to describe how much I enjoy Twilight Struggle. The theme and tension of the game is just magnificent. It's an instant classic. I'm constantly at the edge of my seat, I don't know how to sneak in a couple ops points in a region without giving away that I'm holding the scoring card, I'm scared my opponent have that one card that will destroy my plans, I manage my hand way more intensely than in any dedicated card management game I've played to date, and the list goes on.

If you don't mind playing a game of direct conflict, if you're at all interested in the theme of the Cold War, then you owe it to yourself to play this game!

The 2016 Collector's Edition is gorgeous, but features some annoying mistakes. Hopefully we'll eventually receive the reprinted card corrections.

All the mistakes in the Collector's Edition are tracked here:
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1526152/tsce-backers-mega-thread

The important ones are the nine misprinted cards:
* Non-Aligned Movement: the card text says "South Amaerica" (i.e. misspelled).
* Stanislav Petrov: the image incorrectly shows Vasili Arkhipov, and it's also missing the asterisk to denote removal.
* Berlin Wall: missing the asterisk to denote removal.
* Mobutu Sese Seko: missing the asterisk to denote removal.
* First Lightning: missing the asterisk to denote removal.
* Don't Wait for the Translation: missing the asterisk to denote removal.
* Brush War: is printed as an Early War card, but is actually a Mid War card.
* Arab-Israeli War: incorrectly printed with the "Remove if Played" text.
* Aldrich Ames Remix: missing the "Remove if Played" text.

I'm going to tell you why TS is the only game deserving a 10.

The theme is fantastic. It's the most thematic game I've ever played. You're playing through history full of things happening. It's very tense and you feel like living in a cold war era

The strategy and tactics are brilliant. You need long and short strategy. Long, as in you need to know what you want to do for the whole game. Short, as in you need to maximise your dealt card for this round. You want to have adaptive tactics to react against opponent move and ability to manage disasters.

The social interaction is excellent. You can bluff, intimidate, and basically every trick in the book is usable in the game.

Very rarely a board game excell in all three aspect. and TS is the best in all.

RATING: 8
Really enjoyed my first play of TS but I'm not sure how much it will get to the table due to its length. 

The enormous board and length of the game really gives you a feeling of the grand scope of two superpowers fighting across the globe. What it does well is dividing the game into manageable chunks for you to process by limiting the timing and ways of scoring points. 

I know a lot of competitive players will tell you that you need to learn the cards to enjoy the game but I didn't find that to be necessary at all. I like "discovering" the events as they come out and feeling surprised by what ingenious things the game had in store for me. This obviously will vary depend on the type of gamer you are and how experienced/cruel your opponent is. 

The phrase "narrative arc" is thrown around a lot but for most games "narrative" is an overly strong descriptor. For TS, it is the only way I could explain why I thoroughly enjoy a game that should, for me, be too long, too fiddly, and mechanically uninspired.

After two plays I can't say I know how to play this game (two loses as US). 

A gameplay is very tense and extremely fun. There is a randomness in cards, but I believe that skillful player can overcome this pretty easily. I'm thinking about this game constantly and can't wait for another game (which will be tomorrow :)

sold and bought again. Even if I'll play this game two times a year - it's worth it :)

At this point it's probably a cliche to rate this so highly, but it's just SUCH a great game. Insanely tense.

Tried the iOS implementation as well and found it pretty well done.

Never seen a US victory.

I think the game's fatally flawed, but we all enjoy playing it - and that's why I bought the damned thing. To play and enjoy on rainy days.

If this game:

A. Didn't feature a gargantuan bias toward the Ruskies. 

B. Didn't hugely reward 'Mister Memory Man' for memorising the decks.

C. Didn't have a 're-alignment' system that NOBODY uses.


...I would consider this a club member of my Hall-o-Fame. As it is, Twilight Struggle sits on the sidelines of my collection gathering dust.

This is a great game to play if you don't have a lot of Board game friends. It can be very different every time that you play the game, although you may have to play the game a few times before you really get the feel of the game. It took me and my friend about 4 games before we even realised how to play the game proper. You will also probably notice that the USSR player will dominate in your early playings of the game but as you understand how the game works it will become more balanced for the US.

Fantastic game. Heard the buzz for years and FINALLY broke down and bought it.
Very chess like in feel since you have to really sit and think several moves ahead on how your actions and opponent's actions will play out. The day after I bought it a good friend of mine and me played it nonstop from noon until almost midnight several times.
WOW!!! A very good game and incredibly rich. Many, many possibilities of how things will play out, but still a great amount of skill involved. This is one game that will not grow stale any time soon.

This game is amazing. The mechanism fits the theme so well. This game was made for someone like me, who loves history. I often find myself lost in the cards, thinking about the event or the person on the card.

I'm no history buff, but the tension in Twilight Struggle is very much present in every action you take.  It felt like an area control game with multiple victory conditions.  The card-driven mechanic is a gameplay style I appreciate and I think the cards themselves are well designed.  The only downside I can see is that an experienced player who is extremely familiar with the deck will have an overwhelming advantage, and I am curious to find out how the game will hold up after multiple plays, especially with a finite number and variety of cards, will each experience be similar and thus be mechanical after a while?

This game seems to have most everything I DON'T like in a game.  Limited to two players, overlong, board looks like geography class, loosely based on history where if it plays consistent with history one player's loss should be a foregone conclusion (the USSR lost the cold war, didn't it?).  If I was asked to design the most boring game I could imagine, this would be it.  And it's not like I'm not interested in history-- this game isn't it though, at best it's "alternate" history.  At least Steampunk as alternate history is interesting, cold war alternate history just leaves me, well, cold.  Reading the encyclopedia would be much more fun, and more accurate history too.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Amazing  I've never played a game that so well balances an a-symmetrical challenge. It has elements of chess, poker, bridge, and many other classic games.  But, instead of being just a theme tacked onto mechanics, TS simply IS the theme.  You couldn't separate the mechanics from the brinkmanship that the game emulates.  
I would say that the playtime (at least for my partner and I, who were both new to the game) can actually be quite a bit longer than stated.  However, while your first playthrough may be slow and a bit daunting, once you *get it* (which happens much faster than you'd think when you look at the rule book) it picks up considerably.  
 AND (i know this doesn't matter to most folk), it really REALLY is educational!  I couldn't believe how much more I understood the chronology and mentality and politics of the cold war, by just playing the game.  HALF the rule book is a history lesson - one you don't need to read to play the game, but one you will WANT to read after you've played.  The permutations of historical "what-if"s are so mindbogglingly huge, every game (win OR loose) you'll talk about the game, not in game terms, but as a hypothetical historian might.
GET IT!  
PS, This is NOT a war game.  Not in the way it might look (and be sold to you).  I am not interested in war games at all (gimmy fantasy/ science fiction any day) but this hooked me because, while it is a strategic and tactical game, it is the closest thing to a "passive aggressive" game if there ever wwas one.  No killing, no dramatic action - just a quiet struggle that threatens, like a great thriller, to end in ruin.

Great 2 player game.  It is fun the very first play and you learn more strategies as you play keeping it exciting.  Has a good mix of skill and luck so important in a 2 player game.  The better player will win more often but luck gives the slightly worse player a chance so it isn't the same game each time.  Only downside is it is a bit long to be getting people to play for a 2 player game.

I love how fast situations change and how every moment in a long game is so tense. I hate how really bad luck with drawing just the wrong cards can ruin hours of success. Cooler heads will prevail, but sometimes it's really difficult to keep your head cool in Twilight Struggle... Yet I keep returning to it. A sign of a good game if there ever was one.

RATING: 6
For an overlong Euro that requires deck memorization to be competitive, Twilight Struggle is...not bad. Sparse yet critical die-rolling makes the game swingy, play time is far too long, and it really is only fun if you play it with someone of relatively equal ability, and by ability I mean knowledge of the card deck. But, if you learn it with a friend and play it a lot, Twilight Struggle does reveal itself as a tense, psychological game that's evocative of the Cold War. I love the scope and ambition of the design.

Rather tired of some (dare I say "leftists"?) who think the game represents a "right-wing fantasy" and fail to distinguish between nationalism and conservatism on the right. Not at all synonymous.

RATING: 10
The meanest game in existence that is not unfair or "take that" - the game of constant losing and frustration. The only game around which I had serious argues with my girlfriend. It is mechanically not made for me because I simply cannot, even after more than 70 plays, remember to prepare for some nasty cards that are coming...

Yet, it transfers Cold War events into its abstract numbers with such an elegance, it is thematically so correct and so full (despite necessary reduction to domino theory), and it is, after all - my first game, my first (kinda) wargame... I hate it, and I love it. There is no greater stress than rolling for coup, no greater proud than spreading communism through Africa or South America even though I know I will ultimately loose. 

Edit 25-8-2015: Yes it can be random, or at least dice can ruin one whole game. But more often than not it balances itself throughout the session. Otherwise - it deserves a perfect 10 after all.

After 2+ Plays: Love the theme.  The cards do give a nice historical feel.  It can be frustrating when you have a hand full of your opponents cards, and each play you're helping him more than yourself.  Normally I don't mind luck, but for such a long and strategic game, it sucks to have have all your work destroyed in the final turn by a poor draw.  Still, an innovative and interesting design.

Very, very impressed by the way CDG has portrayed what used to be a blank area, cold war politics. And in comparison to earlier efforts nukes are not the centerpiece. Instead it is the age old struggle of souls and minds. 

However: The sudden death mechanic where you play a card that through a convoluted sequence leads to opponents conducting coups in order to trigger nuclear war is a bad mechanic.

RATING: 10
Certainly one of the best games ever made. The reason I love this game is the story arc and the gameplay arc that intertwine beautifully. The gameplay arc is the most brilliant. Playing 6-7 cards for 10 rounds in most games would become repetitive, but here not only the tactical consideration how to play or mitigate your dealt hand matters, it also matters which specific round you are playing because of the existence of periodical decks that get shuffled into the draw deck and discarded cards that can make a comeback. On top of what a card can do the context of timing through this gameplay arc becomes equally important. 

The balance of the map and regions is very well done. Each region or battleground has its specific strengths, timing and positional elements, which makes the area control play more than just a push and pull of 'cubes'. 

The game also works really well because the card abilities are well thought out and the designer succeeded to nail the thematical aspect of the cards and so a story arc develops in an interesting way. The different uses of 'card points' to do things on the map and the consideration that you maybe have to trigger a very good ability for your opponent all make up for a considerably in depth decision making on how to manage your hand. 

Knowledge of the cards is a necessity if you want to have a truly competitive game and one of the weak points and big hurdles when you want to draw in new players. But learning and teaching the game on the other hand isn't that difficult. Rules are reasonably light in comparison to other wargames and heavy eurogames. 

Lastly the existence of a defcon tracker and thus the possibility of a nuclear war escalation creates a third pillar for the game. Not only can you fall behind positionally on the map, recklessly playing cards can lead to a loss by triggering nuclear war. This not only creates a constant threat but also gives even more considerations and opportunities to manipulate and control the board position or the opponents play.

About the dice rolls and horrible hands: often have I felt desperate when a die roll failed horribly at a critical moment or when a hand of the worst possible cards gets dealt to you. But in a game such as this that got analyzed to pieces, there needs to be uncertain elements and risks to not make it stale and the difficult situations that the game sometimes throws at your lap is what gives this game a gaming heart and soul that makes you want to come back to it. 

My mind was even more blown when recently a Chinese way of playing the game vs the 'positional area control style' came to light. Not often does it happen that in a game, which got analyzed to pieces like this one, a new strategic philosophy of playing is successful. 
   
Note : this game also has the best developed boardgame app with flavourful atmosphere and speeches included.

I'm torn on this game. It does have good depth and I think that it really gives the player an accurate feel of the theme. However, I just find it a bit on the boring side (as I said, represents the theme well, 'Cold War stand off'). The games I have played (6 or 7 total) seem to follow a certain call and response pattern. Player one does this, player two undoes what player 1 did. Player one does something else, player two then counters that move etc etc. I'll still gladly play it but I certainly don't think it is worthy of being the number 1 game nor even top 10.

I'm not sure how to rate Twilight Struggle yet (though I've ultimately decided on a very PC 7).  I've played 5-6 times so far, and it's really tense, but I can't tell if that intensity comes from so much hinging upon the luck of the draw.  The game play is completely immersive though, and I don't know if that's by design or just because I was actually alive for the Cold War (as apposed to the 2nd Punic War, for example), so the game's theme hits closer to home.  When playing, don't underestimate the power of those onesey-twosey VP cards.

RATING: 10
The best two-player game I've played up to date.  What keeps this one going for me is the level of tension that ratchets up during the course of play as you respond to your opponent's actions and figure out how to defuse the hand you've received.  And tempo. Boy is tempo important and hard to manage.

Really looked forward to my first play. Was rather disappointed. Made 6-7 rolls on Space track, success on 1-3 or 1-4, missed all but one. Could keep up a bit due to cards, but was always 1-2 steps behind. 

One turn I started with 5 scoring cards in my hand, meaning I could watch my opponent do free (unopposed) moves for nearly a full turn. 

Game needs a number of plays to learn choke points and crucial cards, if you're willing to invest that time. I'm not.

I like the setting and what the game wants to do, but I just don't like the game.
The cards are random and which cards you draw has a huge effect, as do the die rolls; on the other hand, it takes three hours and then due to these factors the result mostly comes down to luck (which you can try to mitigate with some strategy).

I have a pasted-up copy of the Japanese version of this expansion to [i][thing=65282]Tanto Cuore[/thing][/i]. It's also a stand-alone game and replaces the Bad Habits and Private Maids with Memories/Remembrance cards, which are VPs which can be earned by discarding cards which meet certain criteria.

This is told to be the best of the three, to me it is a second place since the take that aspect has been removed (I enjoyed it very much)

No harm done, add up base game and expansion and you are good to go.

Art is of course more daring seen the bikini theme.

RATING: 8.5
Really surprised me. Everyone kept telling me that if I can get my hands on a copy (not easy to get here) then I ought to because I love Dominion so much and this would be clearly superior in mechanics.

And... having it, yes, it pretty much is. I'm surprised how well this plays. Also, the art style isn't half as annoying as I thought it'd be.

Pretty much my only point of criticism is the production quality. It's overall very good, but spelling mistakes abound.

Another good expansion, but I find the reminiscence cards a bit tricky to plan for.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
What I liked:
* Similar core mechanic to Dominion however a number of cards play very differently so you can't treat it like Dominion.
* Stand alone game that also plays slightly different to the base game.

What I didn't like:
* Poor manual, scoring is confusing for some cards
* Theme not exactly family friendly

A deckbuilding game with a lot of front-loaded decisions. I liked this better than Dominion, but I no longer like playing non-digital versions of deckbuilding games. In terms of digital deckbuilding games, I'd rather play ascension, or if in the mood for a front-loaded decision-making deckbuilding game: Penny Arcade was the most appealing to me.

In terms of the three, I would rank them as follows:

Romantic Vacation > Expanding the House > Base Game

Absolutely love this game.
my friends and I play this game every Tuesday and Thursday after class because it's like our hangout time. They were skeptical at first because of the theme, especially that one card where she has no bra... and the Reminiscence card that is very revealing.. and how the currency is called Love. We all set the standard as ignore the art, but focus on the text. Love cards are dollar cards, and that's pretty much it. After playing the first game, we made plenty of mistakes, as in figuring out which card gives Victory Points or which card goes off first. They love the game, and they would give it a 9/10 and a 10/10! 
The only downside for them is that when using the randomizer, it wasn't as aggressive as they usually play games. I brought his one because I believed it was the simplest version of Tanto Cuore to play, less things to know how to play. As for the base set, it's a bit too much to explain. It's true, however, that Romantic Vacation in my honest opinion, is beginner level introduction. I am planning to buy the base set really soon to compliment my friends way of playing, which is aggression. That one card where you choose the player and hope its a Love card to gain a serving is the only aggressive card in this set. The card where you put one card to the bottom of the deck seems like an advantage giver, which serves no purpose to us much.

I like how the Campfire is the most hated card in my group. When we began playing, the campfire always shows up. Took up slots of the Reminiscence. I don't know what else to say, but I just love this game. I can't wait to buy the base set!
I won't go all out to buy the Expanding the House because I heard there was some imbalances in that set, and that was a big warning to my group. They don't like imbalances of any kind, -cough- Cardfight!! Vanguard -cough- so I'm avoiding that set. Oktoberfest, I may have to give a look into the set, as the kickstarter just finished a couple days ago.

Really want to get into the Tanto Cuore series? Get this one for sure! I recommend it!  It is IMHO, the easiest set to understand, then you can add the other set and slowly adjust!

RATING: 6.5
Second expansion to the Dominion-style deck builder with an anime French maids theme (same warning as the others) -- with the difference being that the buildings, permanent maids and negative cards are now replaced with "reminiscence" cards giving victory points if you discard a number of cards from hand.

PLUS: valuable points from discards, stand alone as well as mixable
MINUS: no permanent maids means no bonuses per turn (unless mixed)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Nothing too crazy in compare to the base game. 

It did added new way of scoring (Reminiscence )which turns the game to become a little more random and luck based, however, in return, its also enable different strategic approaches in compare to the base game, which I personally found desperately lacking.

I really like the addition of style point scoring during the game via the reminiscence cards. The point rewards are enough to keep a player from just playing a two maid strategy for the win.

Ther are some maids in this one that are a little more exposed than the other sets in this series.  I like the new mechanics introduced but I think overall I like expanding the house the most.  I still have to play a game combining the 3 sets.

Pledged on Indiegogo!

Great deckbuilding game with a GORGEOUS art. I have a lot of fun when playing this baby and will always want to play. It has some very nice mechanisms which differ it from Dominion.

I have integrated all the 4 boxes (base game, Expanding the House, Romantic Vacation and Oktoberfest) together and I use a randomizer which can be found on nekomusume.net. I can't recommend both the game and the randomizer enough!

Romantic Vacation wywraca rozgrywkę trochę do góry nogami :) Ze względu na dające spore możliwości karty wspomnień gracze ścigają się, by jak zdobyć je jak najszybciej. Rozgrywka staje się bardziej dynamiczna, wymagania niektórych wspomnień zmuszają do niestandardowych dezycji. Bardzo fajne urozmaicenie.

As last of the original Tanto Cuore trilogy, Romantic Vacation fleshes the system out with slightly more complex card effects. The set also takes the liberty of upping the risqué factor of illustrations, and I'm pretty sure the poor maid featured in the Trek in the Ancient Ruins is missing a vertebra or two.

As the trademark mechanism, Reminiscences are interesting as they have an alternate cost of sorts which isn't easy to achieve. However, my group has noticed that a few Reminiscences have a strong snowball effect if obtained early in the game.

Expansions are good for Tanto Cuore. The base set has too many cards that allow you to draw more cards on top of giving you extra actions, making it impossible to avoid having mid/late-games where players take forever with their turns because they're using all their draw cards and plus action effects to draw out their entire decks. Expansions add more cards that force players into awkward mid/late-game situations that don't allow them to draw a million cards and take like an hour to finish their turns.

This set ends up being my favorite, despite having the most fan-service of the four versions.  'Reminisce' cards are a fantastic mechanic, and effect the flow of the game in a way that I quite enjoy.  I wish that Oktoberfest's 'Beer' mechanic played as strongly!
I do wish this set had Private Maids, however; oh well: time to Mix&Match play!

Dominion, but a little different. I like the twists (Reminiscence Cards, Chambermaids) to its spiritual predecessor, but overall the cards are less intriguing than those in Dominion Intrigue. I believe there are no cards that get rid of cards from your deck, which is annoying, and the cost for some of the cards is way too high for the effect(s) you get. A second look at the cards in the greater scheme of things would have been appreciated. But the artwork is nice (although somewhat provoking on some of the cards).

A good expansion to Tanto Cuore. It's mainly interesting due to the Reminiscence cards that you get by discarding certain cards from your hand – it gives players a new way of using the cards.

The main action cards are OK but still highly non-interactive.

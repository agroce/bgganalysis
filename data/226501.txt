An excellent game!  More immersive and satisfying (and slightly easier) than Shadowrun Crossfire, though clearly sharing the same basic mechanisms. The addition of locations and token creatures adds an interesting bit of tactical complexity without bogging down the flow of play.   The story bits before and after each adventure is a nice touch.  And it is not a problem to solo with four characters, as long as you remember to keep the decks separate.

RATING: 9
Aside from some production issues, a great game.  4 characters is the way to go.  Game shines with 4, the generic party of: Fighter, Rogue, Wizard, Cleric.  Maybe with different classes it will work well at different character counts, but at 4, the generic group works well.

I will start off by saying this game isn't for everyone. It takes a while for being a card game. I do like the puzzle aspect of the game, and I feel like it's the right amount of tough to scratch that logic itch. Some of my friends complained about length of play and that it was tough without the satisfying feeling of overcoming a challenge. I can empathize.

This has become my favorite game to play solo. Each adventure is really just a different play format. I am playing with 2 characters and something like escorting the noble has been much easier than the breach style adventure. I would imagine at different characters counts what is easy and what is hard changes. If you enjoy outsmarting your opponent or always winning, this is not the game for you. You are attempting to work through a puzzle and it is possible for it to be unsolvable. Each adventure advances you forward just a little bit more though, so even in a loss you have small gains. There is a lot of suspense in what cards you flips and strategy to what cards you buy and how your characters effectively work together. Highly recommend.

Fun for the right group (especially those with a D&D background who will recognize some of the lore).  Not sure if my group understands how to enjoy the apparently SLOW character build.  Once you find your groove you just unlock the same market cards and proceed with caution.  It's fun co-op, but that means figuring out the puzzle and carrying on.  Maybe we need to unlock more skills/bonuses or check out the expansions..?

Freakin' hard, seriously! We play two players only and I read a lot about the game being too difficult at this player count - We tried the first scenario of the campaign twice and got our asses kicked badly, but then we won our second try of the dungeon crawl with two expansion characters - the game is definetly beatable and we had a lot of fun with it.

Played the first "QuickStart" adventure only. Seems like it would be a fun campaign game. Lots of great co-op cards and good mechanics on sharing loot and dealing damage.  Would like to do a campaign someday, but between Gloomhaven, Too Many Bones, and Kingdom Death, the backlog of better fantasy-themed co-op campaigns is pretty hard to get through right now, so I won't be buying.

Have read a lot of negative things about both this and Crossfire that make me reluctant to take a chance on buying this.

The stickers thing is the real killer though.  What a terrible idea.  People say you can stick them to cardboard and cut them out to make cardboard pieces out of them, but for 160 stickers for the base game alone...that's a lot of PNP effort for a professional product.  I shouldn't have to do that much work if I buy something, nor should I have to "use it up" just to play it.  

Can't wait for this "legacy" fad to go away.

References to "grinding" are also a turn-off.  Guess it's for people who like MMOs.

It is definitely better than Crossfire. 
I don't like the art so much but it's still good. It is much easier and not so punishing like the previous one. However, most of the problems what I had with that one still there.
XP gain is still ridiculously slow and the shop or market or whatever you call contains too few type of cards. You literally buy the same cards in every single game. And the perks are extremely underwhelming. After 2 plays with a character I felt I don't want to buy again Cloud of Daggers, Lightning Bolts and hopefully Fireball but the game punishes you to buying cards out of your class and to try out others you have to either cheat or start the whole story over again.
I cannot recommend this game.

This game is very difficult, and failure tends to get you stuck in a cycle of slow experience grinding and frustration. After failing 3 of our first adventures, we have decided to modify the rules to set the dragonfire cards to -5 and give our characters completion awards and experience anyway. Otherwise the monsters are unique and have excellent art, there are plenty of adventures to complete, and bountiful rewards await the successful adventurer. We just need to get to that successful part.

Fun game with lots of potential. The assist system makes sure that all players are active at all time which is great. No more just sitting waiting for your turn.

We all have someone or something in our lives that we miss very much, be it a lost family member, a friend, or even a pet.  Imagine this - that person or creature or what have you comes back to life and you see them for the very first time in picture-perfect health.  You move in to hug them or kiss them or simply shower them with all of the love that you have kept for them all this time without them, but when you step forward, someone unceremoniously kills them.  You are wrecked.  But then there they are again, as if nothing had happened.  You're swept up in the moment and rush forward, but before you get to them, they are killed again.  And again.  And again.  And the only solace you get from this horrible, torturous series of events is a promise that you'll get a sticker that makes you a feel a little less like shit each time this happens.

That is Dragonfire.

Okay, maybe I'm tremendously overstating it, but this game is reserved for those who love to get beat the hell up, and I mean beat the hell up.  Not movie-style beat-up where you get a bloody trickle down your chin, but walk away to save the day.  No.  This game brutally takes you by your ear, slams you hard onto some concrete, pins you down, and repeatedly punches you in the eye until your socket shatters and caves in.  Then they leave and you get a chance to just settle in and accept that you are going to die, but then they come back and give you a shot of adrenaline and cave in your other eye.

That is Dragonfire.

You remember that scene in the Princess Bride where Westley is tied to the life sucking machine and the albino is cleaning his wounds?  Then they suck years of his life away, only to heal him again to do it later?  Yeah, picture that, but instead of a life sucking machine, it's a machine that inserts parasites into your bloodstream that devour you from the inside, starting with non-vital organs first so that you get to experience it much longer, and then when you're almost dead, the albino props you up and gives you a potion that restores everything before tying you back down again to give you another dose of those parasites.

That is Dragonfire.

Too difficult to imagine?  Here's a simple thought exercise - imagine that it is always extremely painful to pee, but you are also afflicted with an unquenchable thirst with a crumbly-dry throat 24/7 and an endless supply of cool spring water.

That is Dragonfire.

Someone constantly rubs a balloon on you and forces you to touch metal doorknobs for the rest of your living days.

That is Dragonfire.

That is Dragonfire.

----------------------------

Okay the serious bit - Dragonfire is a brutal game that I can't imagine works with multiple players.  The only way to really succeed at this game is to play multiple characters yourself.  This isn't about teamwork; it's entirely about doing it exactly one way or everything falls apart.  That one way could vary from party to party, but it's still just one way.  Like Seafall, it banks on the idea that the "fun" is applying stickers and buffs to your character sheets, but the game itself is a grind and it is unerringly stacked against you at all times.  This could have easily been a much more enjoyable game if the event deck would throw you a bone from time to time, but each card it's like, [i]this round every monster is stronger, this round every character is weaker, this round you have to fight blindfolded with one hand, this round you have terminal cancer and a severe case of diarrhea[/i].

Is it bad?  No.  It's not bad.  It's just going to appeal to a very specific subset of the gamer universe that finds fun only in combat, but even then, it's less about skill and more about luck of the draw.  It's a game about matching colors..  This isn't about leveling your characters and getting bad-ass equipment; you reset every game and the only thing that changes are the stickers you apply, which ultimately feel useless because they provide such little reward.  And that's the crux of it.  The game is a gauntlet and a challenging one at that, but with so little to look forward to at the end of the road, it's simply not a game for me.

The best thing I can say about my personal experience with the game is that I no longer want to buy Shadowrun Crossfire.

Only one play so far, but I liked the tweaks to the SR:C system. First off, while I like my fantasy games, I strongly prefer the Shadowrun world, especially as something unique. I very much look forward to them porting the tweaks of this game over to that (summer 2018, I was told at PAXU).

I've read a LOT in the forums about the sloppy rulebook, but fortunately we did not have problems when we played, probably because I have a SR:C background. Still, we may encounter them as we go forward.

The tweaks here I liked were:

Cards with increased powers for certain classes = I was a wizard and got some card (Cloud of Daggers or something?) that offered -1 to grey levels for arcane characters but -2 specifically for wizards. I made good use of that and made my guy feel buffed. There were other cards that only offered an assist for the decker (or whatever the green dude is called here). These offered new considerations when buying cards. 

Skill checks/Saves = Hey, I had fun with this one. I bought two "Confusion" cards and used them on monsters who had to take a skill check. If they failed -- which they did -- they couldn't attack that turn. In any case, I like the idea of an effect that's powerful but uncertain. Monsters have these too and can do extra damage so you're not exactly sure how much they'll hit you for.

Locations = They offered another wrinkle to deal with. Seemed similar to the wrecks in SR:C in that they're an extra thing to be dealt with but these are far more dangerous than the wrecks. Still, added dimension means more to think about.

Cycling the market = Great, great rule idea and I will start doing this in my SR:C games. If you don't purchase something (which frequently happens), you can at least cycle one card in the market. This saved our bacon a couple times when we moved out a $10 card and got something affordable.

This is a game that really requires several hours of play before forming a useful opinion of the game. All the reviews I saw on this game were typically made by people who only played the fast start rules that are terrible rules, or after 1 actual game play. I have played several times now, and am a few games into the campaign play, which is really where the gameplay starts to get meaningful and interesting. I imagine there are 100+ hours of gameplay ahead with how the campaign works.

This game fell completely flat, and I don't think it's just me. I strongly recommend you go play Gloomhaven, or literally any deck builder instead.

I found 3 interesting mechanisms in the game: the "match symbol combinations in order" mechanism, the out-of-turn assist mechanism, and the use of discarded event (Dragonfire) cards to passively increase the threat level.

I think all of these are interesting starting points for a game, but I found the rest of the deck building implementation to be objectively sub-par, containing few if any of the innovations we've seen since Dominion popularized the mechanism.

While Shadowrun: Crossfire might have had a different feel due to different card content (I wouldn't know, not having played it), a game with the D&D license shouldn't have this problem, making it even more disappointing.

I'm not kidding when I say that literally every other game I can think of with deck building has a better implementation. By this, I mean: more control over my deck; more incentive to use cards together; more strategy in how to develop the deck; and more opportunity to use the cards I buy. 

Warts and all, other deck building games like Dominion, Thunderstone Advance, Star Realms, Super Motherload, Clank!, Mage Knight, Arctic Scavengers, etc. score much better on these measures.

I realize that the game is a re-theme of Shadowrun: Crossfire, but IMHO deck building was simply the wrong core mechanism to use in both games (for reasons elaborated below). I can't speak to the Shadowrun design other than reading the rules and seeing the parallels, but both games seem to suffer the same flaws.

Some elaboration:

* Based on my experience with 2p and judging from the play count poll on Shadowrun: Crossfire, the game is almost certainly only balanced for 4+ players. That number would potentially open up the assist mechanism to make it at least potentially engaging, and locations and monster facing might work a bit better with more players. Overall, I strongly recommend NOT playing this game with fewer than 4p.

* There are almost no significant and meaningful decisions to be made during combat, just a minor optimization puzzle that generally amounts to determining what damage you can do given your hand.

Gameplay consists of a conveyor belt of monsters and monster-like Locations that players have to throw matching cards at. Monsters do a fixed amount of damage each turn unless they are killed. Attacking one monster versus another is not really much of a decision unless you can kill one, since then it won't do damage to the player it's facing. 

Whether to assist or not, using the relatively uncommon assist-ability cards, was often not an interesting decision, since gameplay comes down to mostly optimizing damage reduction across the party. The symbol matching puzzles might keep the players active, but it's very casual and lacking in consequential decisions.

* There is very little of the standard deck-building meta game present here (card synergies, deck thinning, hand manipulation, strategic purchasing). Players are encouraged to buy a new card every turn (which goes into the hand), yet draw at most 2 cards per turn (and none if they have 4+ cards left in their hands), so deck cycling is very slow. Discarding useless cards to draw more is weak, since you can only draw 2 at a time. 

Certainly with 2p, if you ever hit a snag in taking down an Encounter one turn (thus losing income needed to buy a 3rd card for your next hand), you're unlikely to make it much further before running out of HP. The game really depends on having enough cards out in multiple hands so that any symbol roadblocks can be overcome, thus providing passive income for other players. 2p is simply unworkable.

* The Quick Start guide is abysmal, and frankly, doesn't seem to have been designed by, ya know, an actual game designer. It feels like something the publisher threw together and chucked in the box without any actual testing for balance or enjoyment. 

Put simply, the Quick Start is not a game, just a mechanical introduction; it is an ever-increasing number of monsters attacking the players, with no real goal other than just surviving. 

Due to a lack of any balance, the Quick Start ends with an almost certain defeat for players. This is not the way you want to expose your users to the expensive game they just bought.

This is especially the case for 2p, since the game balance seems in retrospect designed for at least 4p+ players (and even then, I'm skeptical). We played with 2p and it was utterly imbalanced and broken. The amount of damage that came in and the number of cards available to use to resolve encounters were simply not mathematically workable. WTF. 

Look, skip the Quick Start and just play the normal game. If you've played any modern board game, especially a deck builder, it's not hard. Worst case, leave out the Locations and ignore the Dragonfire mechanism, but play the first mission of the campaign.

* I found that there is virtually no narrative or arc to the core gameplay. It's a grab bag of D&D tropes without unifying mechanisms. Why are zombies and ettins attacking us? Not because the party proceeded to a new room/area, but simply because that's what we randomly drew. Why can I spend gold at the end of my turn to suddenly learn the Magic Missile spell, which I can then immediately use next turn? Who knows.

But then none of the cards bought during the game persist into your next game, so that Big Finish or Lightning Bolt that you were able to buy you've somehow forgotten by the next outing. Mechanically I get it, but there's no thematic resonance to the core action of the game. D&D doesn't lend itself well to a pasted-on theme.

Furthermore, there are several non-D&D concepts in the game that don't really integrate well, like the class types (Martial, Arcane, Deception, Devotion). While D&D "adjacent", they feel foreign and contrived.

* The game seems designed for the grind. After our first campaign game (2p), we were awarded 3XP + 1 magic item. For my magic item, I received a one-time use potion. Like, one-time use ever, not per game.

The character features (stickers) that can be purchased with XP range up to 100XP, with even features at 40XP being less useful than the nominal cards available to buy in the market. I personally had no interest in playing the game enough to see any of those, and imagine it would take dozens of games to make notable progress.

* In the end, it feels as if the publisher made the classic blunder of assuming this game would get a lot of attention because of the previous game + license and that players would be interested in playing the game repeatedly over and over again. 

Every part of the game production seems to be designed with the idea that it is the next Magic. It didn't seem to be a priority to them to actually earn those assumptions and make a great game with balance and smooth mechanisms that stood on its own.

Maybe they did the best they could. But this feels like much more of a money grab than anything. It should have been clear from their long experience with Shadowrun: Crossfire that there were some real holes in the design that needed to be fixed.

As a v1 game from a small publisher, I can see how a flawed game like Shadowrun: Crossfire could be tenable to publish. But it's much harder to defend as a v2 with a major (and very expensive) license.

I think Dragonfire is simply a great game of cards. The components in the pack are also really good, the art is excellent and nails the D&D theme (nice reminiscing for any old tabletop players). 

I was surprised at first that it's basically just colour matching, until I saw how quickly the system presents you with interesting puzzles to solve. And I think that random puzzle creation is both what makes it so fun but also imperfect. It can occasionally be brutally difficult and basically impossible due to the luck of the draw which might put some off. But it also keeps you on the edge of your seat and always focused.

Much better to have a coop game that leans on the side of too difficult rather than too easy IMHO.

Finally, this game will get you debating what to do each turn amongst yourself which is the essence of a good coop!

Quick setup, Adventures play in about an hour, good customization and fun game play which requires cooperation to win. I like it better than WH:ACG and PF:ACG because of the faster setup times. 
**edit AS OF 11/27/20017**
After playing about 8 games i decided to go all in and get every available expansion.  I really love the quick adventure setups even after adding a ton of content through the expansions. This game is easy to get to the table and is a ton of fun! It is definitely a challenge and one sub-optimal card play can doom an adventure but the tension throughout the game is great and winning is rewarding.

And to think I nearly passed on this one.  I had my Pathfinder Adventure Card Game and have been nothing but happy with it over the years, providing me with a RPG-like experience that I can enjoy as a solitaire experience, or with friends and family.  

I'm SO glad I took a chance on this one.  As much as I like PACG, it isn't especially challenging and often can feel a bit auto-piloted.  Not Dragonfire.  This is the RPG-like experience I will turn to for a quick setup, challenging and engaging gameplay, and hopefully an ever growing campaign experience.  I am IN!

I have played the quick play version twice. Once with 2 players to learn the game, and once with 5 players to demo it for our local comic shop. The quick play rules are unplayable at 2 players. The game was a blast at 5. I would love to one day try the full campaign mode.

The intro scenario was designed by sadistic wannabe DM's....ready to play? Good, here's what a Total Party Kill looks like. I mean, who does that? How is that supposed to be fun? Exactly the same mechanics as Shadowrun...but nowhere near as enjoyable for only two players. If you already have Shadowrun then you already have Dragonfire, one for the D&D fanboys to play inbetween sessions of Munchkin.

I like it okay despite its flaws, but it just doesn’t  seem to appeal to the gamers who show up at my table. Not very RPG-like or co-op feeling despite the branding and marketing. Moderately complex rules made harder to understand by a lackluster rulebook. Even with houserules, it’s still extremely difficult to beat and so grinding (i.e. failing vs extremely long odds over and over) is the rule not the exception. It’s really more of a highly difficult randomized puzzle challenge than a game sometimes. Now there’s times this is exactly the kind of thing I’m into... but that’s not all the time or many people

This game is a very fine example of a really exciting deck builder with intelligent mechanics, wonderful rules and great illustrations. It plays crisp and is quite unforgiving. Despite of that the whole groups enjoyed it every time . Especially that the game restricts the deck gives it a unique feeling.
The game has quite a learning curve therefore I do not rate it as a ten.

I like it a lot but have some reservations.  Don't like that all the Adventures are the same thing but hoping future expansions will add new and interesting adventures.  Love the cooperative nature and how you really have to be aware of the encounters and which ones to get rid of quickest.  Love the Character progression.

RATING: 8
A reimplementation of Shadowrun Crossfire with some slight tweaks here and there. For me, this is too much like SC to coexist in my collection alongside it. The changes to the game are largely immaterial, and don't really affect gameplay much at all. This feels more like SC 1.2 than 2.0 or even 1.5. Thisisn't to say that this is a bad game. On the contrary, I think if you prefer this theme, this is the version you should get. I find the cyber punk theme more entertaining, personally, so I'll be keeping the original game. This is still a very solid system though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Dragonfire gave me the two things Crossfire couldn't:  A more legitimate chance to win some of the time and more content.  I grew to accept the beatings paid down by Shadowrun after a while, but I got bored with the lack of new content over the years.  Dragonfire hit the ground running with 3 expansions released in the first couple of months on the street.  The theme was a little more my speed also, though I found Shadowrun to be a decent theme.

I don't see how this improves anything in Shadowrun - in fact I enjoy Shadowrun more. I don't see why as this is a re-implementation, they haven't managed to smooth things out, improve the rulebook etc. Dragonfire cards work well as an event deck though. 
Rules of location encounters aren't very clear and enemy engagement isn't fantastic. I mean, what do you do if you have defeated your foe (as you generally have limited options  for assistance)?
I do like the fact that it is getting better support and add-ons than Shadowrun did. Solo deckbuilders are probably my fave games, so I do like this, but it isn't as good as Thunderstone, Aeons End, Xenoshyft, Legendary, Draconis Invasion etc.
Who knows - maybe the exp stickers will improve things?

Rating after one play of a one-off adventure. Very much looking forward to trying the campaign. It's very similar to Crossfire, but they added in new mechanisms that 1) highlight the traditional fantasy setting, and 2) make it slightly easier than Crossfire. These (plus a more appealing theme) add up to this game basically firing Crossfire for me.

Just about as good as co-op deck building gets. Tight, meaningful decision making and truly cooperative play with strong themes and fun situations. Difficulty can be a little random and campaign character progression isn't as substantial as one might hope for, but overall a great game. I would rank Aeon's End slightly higher, but this sets up and plays faster and has campaign play.

Buyer beware:

Rating based on Catalyst Games. They don't reply to their customers' emails and after reading online ([url=facebook.com/CatalystGameLabs/reviews]facebook.com/CatalystGameLabs/reviews[/url]), this has been a known issue with the company for quite some time. This lack of support is especially disheartening for a game like Dragonfire that will be having regularly released content.

Also, it looks like they will be having convention-exclusive promos for this game. This means that most of their fanbase won't have access to part of the game.

I'm not supporting a company doesn't want to bother with their own fans.

Crossfire is one of my favorite games, yet this one did not necessarily improve on the formula.

My biggest gripe is that it dosen't play as well at a 2p count.

The market is also less interesting. You pretty much have to buy cards 'of your class', and there seam to be too many 2gold cards, which you generally want to avoid(esp in 2p). 

The locations are a mess in 2p with their difficulty being all over the place.

A fantastic game. Complex rules as far as the eye can see as usual, but very fun to play with a group of friends who really enjoy that type of gameplay. My only complaint is that the quick-start rules do a poor job of explaining the game. If you haven't had experience with similar games this one can be confusing and hard to jump in feet first. I wish the quick start rules did a better job of explaining how a scene and round works, I found myself having to search online to truly figure out how the game works. The best solution I could find was to ignore the quick-start battle and just jump right to Dungeon Crawler, one of the individual battles seperate from the campaign, and follow a playthrough on youtube. Nonetheless, if you are a fan of D&D and deck builders, this is a solid game that encourages a group of friends to play through many times with variation.

Solid co-op dungeon crawl. Feels a bit like the pathfinder card game with more depth. I do prefer this game to Pathfinder. The rules are a bit daunting early but smooth out after a round or two. I'm not sure I'd play with 6 again as it feels a little long with that player count. We haven't dove into the legacy aspect yet so that may change my view a bit. The art is great as with most D&D games. The components are so so. Not sure if I will buy this or not.

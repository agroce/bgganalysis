Mostly a kids game.  Nothing wrong with it, it actually has some decisions to make, not too terribly exciting either.  Lots of luck based on card draws and ducks flipped.

RATING: 7
Daft but a lot of fun.  It's just like the game you can play at a Fair Ground, except that you can play card to affect the order of the ducks.  Kind of has the spirit of the Darts game "Killer."

Anyway, it's pretty random and there's not as much skill to it as something like Bang!  BUT it's a lot quicker and easier to play, and providing they don't mind the possibility of being KO-ed, this would be a good one to play with your kids.  It's also work as a drinking game down the pub.  

Ok, so there can be a Kingmaking problem in that you can gang up on someone, but you can always work in some mechanism or other to decide who gets shot if there are two players left who'd benefit from missing your shot - die rolling etc?  It's just a daft, fun game anyway, so who cares?

Nice game to have in your collection esp for last game of an otherwise heavy session.

Fun little "take that" type game.  The game felt a little too random and we all burned quite a few cards waiting for take aim and shoot! cards to turn up.  It worked quite well and unless there is really some bad blood at the table the game consistantly engourages you to pick on the leader.

Can't really get the point of this game. Everyone will gang up on the leader,  so eventually everyone will be down to 1 or 2 ducks,  and then it's fairly random who gets killed first.  Of course, by that stage, I'm usually glad that the game is coming to a close!

Funny game about shooting ducks.  The art on the cards is funny, and the player elimination is tolerable since all players can still participate until the game is over.  The one downside is that sometimes a player that has been eliminated can have the sole decision on who wins and loses.

Little "Guillotine"-like cardgame, with a little more "Take that!" in it.

RATING: 6
If you're looking for a strategy game or a game that one has control over what happens, this isn't it.  Sometimes, the events in the game happen and there is nothing to avoid it.  But, it's a fun game.  The theme works and there are some decisions involved.  I would say that it's similar to Guillotine.

RATING: 7
Fantastic game either for family with kids, but also just for a good fun between friends. I play it a lot with my wife and sister, and we love to "quack" and make a lot of fun during playing.

The only thing I miss a little bit are more different action cards, and a few more copies of some of the ones, where the game gets a bit more intense, ex. like "Disorderly conduckt" where the duck line it totally re-arranged.

If you don't own them, I recommend that you add the "Resurrection" and "Give Peace a Chance" cards to the game.

All in all, you must buy or at least try "Sitting Ducks Gallery" for a good and funny time.

Nice Take that game, I like that no one is eliminated completely unlike Bang. Gives someone a chance for Revenge.

Since no one is eliminated from the game, I've thought of playing it where everyone's color is hidden from everyone else. You just keep playing till there is only one color left then the winner turns over his card to show that he/she won. 
Still haven't played it like this though.

A take that! style card game that suffers a bit from the potential kingmaker problem that soured Family Business.  The game attempts to solve this by having eliminated players still take part in card play, so they're not totally out of the game.  Some fun.

I think this game would be okay if the rules were hammered out (they might be, just there were some annoying problems in our play) and it was slightly shorter.

Actually this is the type of game I would like as a short filler.

RATING: 6.5
This one has been growing on me.  I like the fact that you can still shoot ducks after you've lost.  Allows for some REVENGE!

August 2007 - This seems to be a very easy game to get non-gamers to play.  There are a lot of shoot cards to keep the game going quickly.

My kids play this one quite a bit.

January 2008 - This is a family/kid game.  The number of actual decisions in this game are almost non-existent.  The game basically plays itself.  Its all about who you want to shoot.

This is almost more of a toy than a game.  For some reason it is fun to take aim and shoot at the ducks, but there is very little skill in the game.  It is almost a sure thing from the start that most people will all have one duck left when the game ends, because everyone will shoot at the ducks of the player that has the most ducks left.

My one play of it was enough.  It was fun, but I have no need to play it again.  It might have more replay value with kids.

RATING: 5
Players try to keep their five ducks alive as long as possible.  The ducks emerge from a deck and sail along a pond track.  Players take turns playing action cards that rearrange the order of the ducks on the track, or shuffle it along, etc.  Some cards place targets on the pond track location, and others shoot the duck which takes it out of the game.  Reminded me a lot of Guillotine, but this is probably cleaner, with more of a party game feel to it.  I liked it, but it's probably 15 minutes too long.

Well, now, here's a cute little game.  You are trying to shoot everyone else's duck and keep yours in play.

It goes a tiny bit too long for a cute light game.  But we enjoy it.  The special powers keep it interesting, the artwork is humorous and fun.

Interestingly, my family generally really dislikes back-stabbing games, but they like this one.  I guess because you have no choice but to shoot each other's ducks.

It's a decent game, I'm being conservative with my rating since we've only played it twice.

Initial Rating: 5.5 (April 2012)

I played Sitting Ducks Gallery over 4 years ago, so I don’t remember much about the game. However my desire to play it again is very low.

I hate the theme, in general I hate themes that encourage or are about hunting/fishing/killing animals, so I don’t think I will ever play it again. 

I remember I thought the game was, somewhat, fun, but very light. It features player elimination, but it plays, relatively, fast. I also remember I thought the game had lots of luck.

Bottom line. I don’t want to play Sitting Ducks Gallery again, mainly due to the theme. The game has a lot of luck. It is very light for my current tastes.

At first I thought this was a clever family-friendly version of Family Business.  The game was OK until the end game.  Players who lose all of their ducks continue to play cards which makes the outcome of the game totally random (and meaningless).  What's the point?  I will never play this again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
An extremely chaotic card game where you play hot potato with a limited range of options and there is pretty much mandatory kingmaking in the end. Supposedly the final "revenge" bit is part of the appeal, but the game would become entirely sluggish and random if everyone actually tried not to hurt and aggravate each other, so it's still completely arbitrary.

Fun, light, filler game with a theme and artwork that helps make this fun.  I suspect that the game could drag at the end as the last two players try to eliminate each other although I haven't really seen this happen (yet?).  Whatever the case may be, this is a fun little filler game that I like to bring out and play periodically.

[b]Very random and few real decisions to make. Three cards isn't a lot to choose from, especially if two of them apply to "your duck" and none of yours is currently out.

Not a good game - no control, and the game can stagnate if you don't draw the right balance of target and shoot cards; this has happened in both games we've played so far, making the game far too long for the fun factor.

Warning: I think we played with more neutral ducks than normal. Probably the game will be more interesting.

Luck driven, not interesting and not even fun. Most of the rounds you have dead hands with nothing to do.

We were 3 players. Maybe it will be more enjoyable with more players, but it will be much more chaotic for sure.

I will avoid playing it whenever I can.

Some silly fun in that Family Business take-that kind of way. Play an action card to move your ducks along out of the way of the targets and get other players' ducks under the targets, or shoot another player's duck, or play a defensive card to try and keep your ducks alive. The last one with ducks alive wins. Parents have little hope of winning this because the kids can easily gang up on them, but that's fine because it's fun for them and that's the point. The kids also have to enter into it in a fun spirit, taking hits on the chin and not making it personal. If your family can do that, it's a fun game. For gamers, there's not a lot of point playing except as a very light filler as the indiscriminate take-that turns it into a popularity contest.

This is like a kid friendly version of Guillotine sharing the same mechanic of line manipulation and being somewhere in between Guillotine and Tiki Topple.  

The rules are a bit less clear though earning it only a 5.5 rating from me; that destroyed a bit of the fun for me though it wasn't bad.  I'll have to do some research now to see if we were playing it wrong.

Similar to Guillotine.  A light diversion with no long-term planning or strategy.  It's odd that players can be eliminated from possible victory, and yet can keep playing to hose others -- an invitation to Kingmaking problems if ever there was one.  It's a way to pass the time, but not much more.

The gameplay is fun, but the game is pointless in the end, because the winner is either determined randomly or by the player who has the choice between killing any of the two last ducks.

[Playroom entertainment 2nd edition] {Beer&Pretzels; take-that; optimal 5-6p} [5.5 without resurrection card, 4.5 with resurrection card] Sitting Duck is a cute and light 'take-that' game. It's good as a filler or opener. Length of a typical game is fast; however, the resurrection cards may drag the game on (we finally dispose the resurrection cards in the action deck).  King-making problem is very serious and the winner is usually determined by table talks.

The illustration of cards is cute and informative.  The board is not really necessary even though it's handy.  The box, similar to other Playroom Entertainment games, is horribly large than needed.

The hard part about this game is that there really is a lot of screwage.

This is a fine filler, since it's quick and provides some good laughs, but it seems to me as though there are a couple of issues with it.  There can be many turns per game in which a player has no applicable cards to play.  Players may be forced to harm themselves instead of discarding as well, which leads to a weird sort of feeling of, "I guess I'll discard this, since none of these cards work, no wait. I guess I have to shoot myself."

A silly game. Be the last player with ducks that haven't been shot. Players that are out still get to play. Can anyone say "Kingmaker"?

To me a lighter version of what Guillotine offers, although they are different for sure.  I enjoy it, especially with non-gamers and young players because of the theme.  There are some rules/card text problems that arise, though.

RATING: 5.8
A nice filler.  The best comparison I have is with Guillotine.  If you like the luck and chaos of that game, you'll probably like this one too.  It also reminds me of that old computer game where you were blasting the ducks that popped up everywhere.

Have fancied this game for a couple of years but now that I have played it I don't like it much. It is a 'take that' type game - which is fine. Unfortunately I found it slow and fiddly and not much fun. Would rather play Family Business, Killer Bunnies (fiddly but more meat)or Guillotine.

Kind of a poor man's Family Business.

nice little filler. Lots of 'take that', lots of sweet revenge (a player without ducks left remains in the game to shoot the other ducks)

Heerlijk luchtig kaartspelletje met uiterst humoristische illustraties.

Spelers proberen hun eenden zo lang mogelijk in leven te houden, maar ze komen hoe dan ook een keer op de schietrij te liggen, en dan kunnen ze zo maar neergeschoten worden.

Heerlijk voor tussendoor, maar ook niet meer dan dat.

It can get a little tedious after too many plays, but my 7 yo daughter likes it now.  She didn't at first because she didn't like people targeting and shooting her ducks, but she's learning to get into the right spirit.

Update:  Now 9 yo daughter still loves to shoot our ducks.

Try to keep your ducks alive by manipulating the line of ducks. Similar to several other "change the line" games but if you need one of these games get this one.

Played once (with 4 players). A bit similar to Family Business, but there seems to be more tactics in it (although the control remains quite low).

RATING: 7
Evil little fun game. Not to play with people who cannot stand being targeted by the others. This is about the fun in the process, not winning, as one has barely any influence on whether own ducks survive or not.

An amusing filer game, with a nice 'take that' factor.

Fast game, perfect as a filler.  Easy to learn, great to play with kids and adults at the same time.  Not enough strategic, but still very fun.

This is more of a family game. We bought this more for my little niece than for ourselves. If you are looking for strategy and thinking games, then this is not the game for you. If you are looking for some light-hearted fun and some children are involved, then this game would be close to ideal.

The box says it is for children 10 and up. My niece was only 7 when she first played it and did not have any difficulty understanding the rules.

My main gripe is the relatively small number of action cards which implies regular reshuffling is required when a bigger number of players are involved.

A nice little filler. I will give this another try for sure and think our group will probably even play this more often.

Only one playing, but seems very bad. Very bad player elimination problem (the player is essentially out of the game, but has to continue) and this is very very light, too. Will have to try more, though :)

Mueve tus patos en el tablero para evitar que sean eliminados. El último jugador con patos restantes ganará.

I think this is a set where a well educated german may have a big advantage against a less educated person, or child.

Can sometimes run a little long, but is usually fairly entertaining until it gets there.

I like history. For me the easiest of the Anno Domini series.

Trivia games are not games, they are [url=http://www.human-memory.net/types_declarative.html]non-interactive skill[/url]  contests, played on an uneven field, which are fun for equally matched players/teams, but usually devolve into which team gets lobbed more softball questions in their weakest category, à la Trival Pursuit. Great for finding the Rain Man in your social group.

Excellent game (the series comes in about 20 "flavours") for reading and speaking in German, and learning some history as well.

Enjoyable to play with my mother, even though she left Germany almost 50 years ago.  No shortage of "aha" moments learning German history!

We play with 6 cards instead of nine to start--the game is extremely challenging to us!

Good game series for the historically inclined. Arrange historical event cards in the correct chronological order, if you make a mistake, draw some more event cards. Get rid of them all, you win. Does that sound like fun to you? Then go for it.

A filler game that can be played with up to 8 players. It is an advantage to be good in german history, but most of the times you can only guess. (adi)

If you can find a topic that you're interested in then these are a terrific set of games. More of an educational exercise or family game to play with the grandparents than an entertaining game. If you're interested in a certain topic though then I can recommend trying one of these out. Generally I have a low desire to play any one topic over and over again, but the Deutschland set is a good generalised topic that works well as a stand alone. Single topics work well with certain groups, and with 336 cards per set I don't mind them separated into topics.

Can be a fun game with the right group of players. Very simple to explain and get up and running - you're placing cards based upon their chronological order, trying to get rid of your hand. As the timeline grows it becomes increasingly harder to find the right gap for cards you have remaining. I enjoy it with family, but my rating is based upon my feeling of its general reception with gamers and how I feel about playing with them. Of all the topic specific decks I like the broad Deutschland one the best... or maybe the VIP set... or the Europa Set... or... Hmm. I'd like it if they came out with a good pick of mixed topic cards for a more diversified game so I could own just one set, but that wouldn't be a good business decision.

At least, compared to the Timeline series, you get a decent number of cards in a set. With 336 cards per set you're not going to get too bored of the same questions too quickly.

I like all the Anno Domini games. Of course you might have a better chance if you are good in history, but a lot of those events are guessable for everyone alike. It helps if you are good at bluffing and judging other players ;)

Have had this since my Berlin days. It's quite fun although it 1) can be quite long and 2) you get used to the event cards after having played it some times. 
Still .. I like this game and it's very easy to get into.

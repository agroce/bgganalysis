This is a fun and simple game that to me abstractly represents the elements of a war game, like in war games you have to 'maneuver' (place) a finite amount of forces in such a way to achieve superiority over critical points on the board, you can conduct a prepared defense in depth, attempt to exploit breakthroughs, etc. Really fun

You can mark the Blokus Duo's square area and starting points to the board for a better 2-player experience. Also, leave the outer squares unused for 3-player game.

RATING: 6
[I]tl;dr - Surprisingly, Blokus holds up, and for an abstract you can land for $10, it's a worthy addition to any collection.[/I]
[COLOR=#CCCCFF]____________________________[/COLOR]

Blokus is a solid abstract in which you're working to block other players and lay all of your various tetris pieces onto the board. I love the chess-like nature of 2-player blokus; 4-player is fun, but it tends to play quicker, and the focus is on blocking off a space to call your own. In 2-player you really get a duel of minds for who can place the pieces most effectively with an eye to moving into the other person's area. 

This is one of those mass-market abstracts that punches above its weight. It's still fairly low on the list -- I'd pick [thing=949][/thing], [thing=163031][/thing] or [thing=10660][/thing] over Blokus, but Blokus is the rare abstract that can play 4 players. It's solid, unassuming, and will be in my collection at least a little longer.

RATING: 8
Blokus was introduced to me over Christmas break this year. A good friend bought it for his kids (6 and 9) and we ended up playing it instead of them.  It is simple to pick up, but can be quite complex in planning and strategy. An excellent game for all age ranges.

RATING: 10
One of my favourite games.  I love trying to fit all my tiles onto the board.  I also think this is one of the best games for the classroom.  The extreme simplicity to learn, short play time and mix of spatial and logical reasoning make it a must have for schools (as long as you don't lose any pieces; losing even one piece ruins the game).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Tenative rating based on 2 plays. I'm not an abstract fan, but got this one for playing with the wife. It it smartly designed - one of those obvious, simple rule sets - plastic bits that fit well on a made-to-place-no-wiggle board. The strategy will favor those with spatial skills and smarts. In general, I like it, but it's not something I long to play.

An excellent 4 play abstract stratgey game.  It has nice pieces and board.  

Unfortunately, my daughters (7 and 9) did not take to this game.  For them it's too long and boring.  
This is generally the response for most abstract games. 

But it did seem to work very well with my gaming group.

It's fun, although have only played it 2 player.  There's a lot of different strategies for 2-player play that can end up winning, whereas it seems that picking a "better" strategy would be more important for 4-player play.

One of my favorite games, Blokus feels like a combination of tetris and Chinese checkers.

ABSTRACT

A popular abstract strategy game that you can even find at Target. Fit the colorful tiles on the board and try to block or trap your opponents. The winner is the player who, at the end of the game, has the fewest number of tiles remaining.

A pretty simple tile laying game with a small amount of depth & strategy to be explored.  Each player places one of their tiles (of varying tetris-style shapes) on the corners of the board, and from then on must place tiles only on the corners of their own tiles.  You try to place as many as you can, weaving in and out of your opponents tile placements, hoping to block them off and keep yourself from being blocked.

This game plays very similarly to other unit placement area control games (e.g. through the desert) and grows old after a few plays.

New players usually have no chance. If all players know how to play: the one who stays out of trouble (=forgotten by other players) wins. Blokus trigon is the same with 4 players, and 3 players have too much space. 2 player: might as well play other abstracts.
Best basic strategy: Trying to expand into other territories, like bottom right player expanding to left top player, is more important than just blocking (=you have less possibilities) others.

Blokus is sort of multi-person Tetris as a board game.  The game is simple, elegant, fast, and very enjoyable with 4 people (2 works OK).  I really like the balance of competitive and semi-cooperative as players inter-weave their pieces into each others.

05+ or 06+, 1-4 players, best with 4, 20 mins. Current addiction Jan 2012. V beat Grandpa 6 times running! GP having quite some trouble coping with this. Have now marked the board so we can play Blokus Duo as 2 playing 2 colours each, or 3 playing a dummy player 4th colour, is just too slow and can become confusing. For 3 players Blokus Trigon is better and easier to manage.

The plastic cartons that come with the game to store the pieces are so brittle and warped they are useless. One piece came slighty warped but still fits.

Other than that though, it is awesome! Its like going from playing Chess on a travel magnetic board then playing on a full size deluxe wooden set. Its a pleasure to play on. Everything just feels, fits and plays better.

{1 play, 2 player} I may be kidding myself, but what I like about this one is that even though the game (probably) rewards deep play, it also seems like you can play it by "feel" and do just as well, mostly due to the fact that pieces can "escape."  I love that part of it.  The connecting-by-corners thing is brilliant.

Ridiculously simple yet strategically satisfying. Almost makes you feel bad for liking something so simple looking, but it's undeniably good. Perhaps its greatest strength is that underneath its simplistic appearance, it allows for plenty of drama and playful spite. It is also, unquestionably, one of the most accessible games I've played.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A solid abstract game that can easily appeal to fans of Tetris.  The piece placement is considerable different though and that can throw players.  As the pieces of various players get closer to each other, it is easy to miss how a player can slide into a territory because the corner connection is what matters.  If not for the slightly unusual placement rules though the game is pretty run of the mill.  It plays quickly enough not to wear out its welcome.

11/9/2017:  This is turning into a favorite activity for my 3 year olds.  They can play it every night.  For them it is just like playing with blocks or a puzzle.  They just put the pieces together.

2008: A fun game with adults, but much more fun with playing with kids.  My rating goes up to and 8 when playing with my 8 year old niece.  She loves this game.

I've tried this game with a few non-gamer friends, and there are several that do not seem to care for this game at all.  This game may be a little too analytical, or left brained for some.  After more play, raised my rating of this game as it's one that is easy to play with my non-gaming friends and kids.  It's a very different game with adults, but is a quick filler.

I'd only recomment this with 4.

My parents got this for my 26th birthday (after I asked for it) and I've now played it a handful of times. At least once each with 2, 3, and 4 players and 4 is the preferred for me. As long as I can keep finding opponents I'll be happy.

2012-11-11 I'm not interested in playing this with three. Two I'm not sure whether I'd rather play two colours each or on the smaller board.

If go and tetris had a kid it would be blokus.  Unfortunately for me, that kid does not have nearly the strategic strength of go, and I do not particularly care for tetris.  Still, blokus is fun.  The Gipf series is better.

Raised from 6 to 7 due to the accomplishment of being a good abstract for more than 2 players.  With more than 2 this can do something gpif series cannot.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
One of my first Euro/designer games, Blokus remains my favorite abstract strategy game.  When played by four people of at least competent skill levels, it can be a tense and tactical dogfight.

One knock on it would be the fact that one weak player can significantly sway the game, as playing badly and cutting yourself off leaves more room for maneuverability for the other players and, thus, less tension.  But this is only terribly relevant if you care much about the final score, and I rarely do.

Also worth noting is the fact that Blokus is really only ideal for the full four players.  The three-player version is a hack (all three players control the fourth color by turns); for a better three-player-specific Blokus game, see Blokus Trigon.

The two-player game (both players control two colors) works fine, but a better implementation is Travel Blokus/Blokus Duo, where the board is actually shrunk down and each player controls only one color.  That variant can be played on this board, as long as you have some way of arbitrarily assigning the necessary boundaries.  If you only intend to play two-player, though, you should get the smaller board instead.

Initial rating, based on playing three times. I'm not certain if I like this less or more than Blokus Duo, which I last played over two years ago. Still love the concept of this game. It feels hard to consciously play well, to really envision the board. 
I _think_ the full game feels more interesting than the 2-player version - it seems more dynamic - but the way a 3-player game works feels somewhat clunky, and of course you can be really screwed over by both other players deciding independently to mostly focus on blocking you rather than each other.

You can also spell out rude words with the pieces while you are waiting for your wife to hurry up. Come on you've all done it!

I think I liked this more when it first came out. However to me there is very little replaybility. After awhile it just stops being fun. A nice abstract game where the fun is dependent on your opponent. 

I will play it if there are no other games available but I will not ask to play it.

I really love abstract games. This game is absolutely ideal with 4 players or 2 players. 3 players ends up being a little odd to keep track of.  I love playing this game to kick off game night. Usually just one round and then on to deeper games.

Destined to be a classic! Blokus has all of the requisites for becoming a timeless classic game. It has a high enough profile that many non-gamers I've met have heard about it in the mainstream. It also has a timeless look and "non-theme", quality parts and board, a simple but interesting design, and excellent replay value. While this is not my personal favorite game of its type, it is for many other people who have played it, and its always a hit anytime it comes out of the box.

This is an aethetically pleasing game with simple rules that has a significant level of tactical depth. Thus it is the type of game to introduce to a nongamer. 
As a serious gamer, I enjoy abstract games that require skill to play well and this is one of them! The game is basically territorial, and it feels like a wargame as you try to prevent opponents from advancing on your spaces while you invade theirs!  A must in any family's collection. Have played it many times and still enjoy it. Best with 2 or 4 players, but nearly as enjoyable with 3.

I have had lots of friends tell me about this one and I finally got to play it.  Only one 4-player game so far, but it is more difficult to block people than I originally anticipated.  I have played Cathedral MANY times, but in that one you aren't restricted to connecting with existing pieces and you have to touch edge-to-edge to claim areas.  So I was off the first part of the game strategy wise, but enjoyed this alot and came out with 16 points at the end.

Being a skulker in all the local thrift stores, it's always a treat to find a high rated or rare game that's complete.  Blokus was one such treasure.  It's always a fun little puzzle game that anyone can learn how to play, but beneath the surface lurks a brain-burner.  It is absolutely necessary to plan ahead if you want any chance of winning.  I'm not super into abstract games like this, but of the offerings that are out there, I can see why this one rises to the top.  [Thrift $2.99]

I like this game a lot, although it can be a bit *too* nasty with only two players.

*NOTE* If you play the two-player variant where you only play on a 14x14 grid a la Travel Blokus, the two-player version is MUCH better.  After trying that, we simply won't play the regular two-player version again.  It's nowhere near as good.

Still, the game is best played with four, and can be a very cruel game.  As my buddy's wife noted: "Blokus is not a game nice people play."

[i]Posted: 4/7/07, Rated: 8[/i]

Imagine someone taking the old video game [i]Tetris,[/i] and morphing it into a four player board game.  That is basically what you get with [i]Blokus.[/i]

Each player is given a quota of pieces to place.  The difference in [i]Blokus[/i] is that when you play a piece, it must touch at the corner of another one.  You cannot have a straight side touching at all.

This one, simple limitation means that you cannot interlock two pieces to shut out an opponent: there is limited board space, after all.  Careful placing of your pieces can allow you to worm your way through your opponents' formations, seeking out those big pockets of empty space that will allow you to play your larger pieces.

The pieces themselves acquire personalities as a result.  Long straight pieces are good defensively, or to flank a position.  Pieces with lots of corners provide more flexibility for future placements.  All in all, the simple rules and shapes come together to create strategic options.

Perhaps the most important thing for me is that my wife loves to play [i]Blokus.[/i]  Even though it is a simple game, that earns it an extra point in my book.

(3-4 players, 15 minutes) A curious area-claiming puzzle game, where the goal is to place as many of your pieces on the board as possible - the only trick is they must all connect to each other, and only at corners! Whoever has the least amount of shapes left in their supply wins.

RATING: 7
So far, Blokus seems like a pretty fun abstract game – and better yet, one which most people are willing to play! I'm not a fan of the three-player version, but it's fun with four or two (with a smaller board). The pieces look nice and it's easy to learn, so it is great for drawing people into a world of fun games. Since it's a perfect information game, it could involve some very deep analysis, but I find I play it very tactically without thinking too much about what pieces players have left (until the very end, perhaps). This is fine with me because it makes Blokus quick and light, yet still interesting. (2009-01)

Still my favorite abstract strategy game.  I think Scott Nicholson described it best when he said it was similar to the light-cycle races in Tron.  Trying to box out your opponents while leaving yourself with room to grow is a really clever game system.  It can lead to some AP in the later turns, because some players have difficulty seeing if they have any possible moves left.  But if everyone helps by notifying the player of their available options, then it shouldn't be a problem.  I really enjoy the puzzle-like feel and the strategy required.  Plus it's amazingly simple to teach and learn.

The one downside is the fact that it really only works for 4 players.  The 2 player game is acceptable, and the 3 player game is dreadful.  Still I think if you will have enough opportunities to play 4 player this game is a must try.  It has strategy, cut-throat moments, and seems to appeal to a wide variety of players.  I can see why this game has been purchased by Mattel and is on game shelves in major stores everywhere.

This game is great with four and works really well with two, although I generally dislike games that require you to take on the roles of missing players.

Despite its appearance, Blokus isn’t Tetris made boardgame but a quick and intuitive family game on its own: there’s a heavy dose of player interaction, in the form of upsetting an opponent’s plans by occupying - some would say «stealing» - the most precious free spaces in a cramped board getting even more cramped every turn.

Blokus isn’t the game you would play on and on, yet it is still a very enjoyable one.

Ez egy játék egy egyszerű játék, mely a tiszta stratégiai tervezésen alapul, melybe a szerencse szerepe nagyon kevés. A szabály elmagyarázása 2-3 perc és utána mehet is játék. Nagyon tudom ajánlani a társasjátékokkal ismerkedőknek. Bármikor elő lehet venni egy maximum fél órás partira, bár ez erősen függ attól, hogy tényleg mennyit gondolkodnak a játékosok. Én már keveset játszom vele, mert rengeteg összetettebb és bonyolultabb játékok vannak a piacon.

I feel this is a must-have.  Plays 2, 3, and 4 players well.  It's quick, cheap, w/ gorgeous components. Great filler, plays any age, quick set-up and put away. Can't beat it for accessibility, ease of teaching, and fun to play.

Fun 4-player filler. I think I really like the dynamic of a multiplayer abstract.

It's also a great two-player game with the Blokus Duo 14x14 grid. Very tactical. I like it since tactical games are the only way I can actually beat my wife!:) Non-gamers really get this game.

Already having heard very good things about this game, we tried it out on our first 2004 session of our boardgameclub.  We played it with four and it was a very nice game.  Although there is no story behind the game, it has enough to bring lots of fun to its players.  Eager to play it with 2 once in future.

I've definitely had some fun with this game, but it just doesn't give me enough bang for my boardgaming time buck.

Plus, it would be a shame to play this with anything but exactly 4 players.

What I Like: 
It's simple. It's Pretty. It's fun. I am not a huge fan of abstracts, but this one seems so familiar thanks to games like Tetris, that it feels very timeless.

What I Don't Like: 
My only complaint against the game is that it does not play well with 3. In fact, I would NEVER recommend it with 3 players. 

Why I Still Own It:
After marking the board to contain the Blokus Duo board, it's like owning 2 games in 1. The wife loves it, and it takes almost no time to play. Always an enjoyable experience.

A fun abstract I can play with pretty much anyone (including a bunch of Middle School students at my church). I particularly like it because my brain enjoys the spatial dimension to this game.

This game is not dead for me, but I am finding it a struggle to get it to the table, so it is falling in my view. The gameplay is interesting, and I love that you seem to run out of real estate even faster than in something like Ingenious. However, the choices in Ingenious are more complex (in an interesting way, not an overwhelming way), and I just find Ingenious' play to be much more compelling than this. It can be a nice challenge, and I do find it very fun, but these days there are certainly better Abstracts.

[b]Blokus[/b] reminds me of that puzzle game where you have various game pieces in the shapes of different sized triangles and squares, and you try to fit them together into silhouettes of cats, houses, and other things.

I've only played this on iOS, but after two dozen games I'm still terrible at it. I find it very hard to plan any moves in advance, so each turn is a matter of trying to get an advantageous placement. Unfortunately in a four-player game, the board changes so rapidly that by the time it's your turn again what was once advantageous is now worthless. As a quick, simple tactical puzzle it holds my attention for the five minutes it takes me to play, but there are plenty of better abstract games out there.

Pretty good abstract game, and I'm usually not a fan of that genre.  Good for when you want to relax a little bit, bit still want to rack your brain a little as well.

Basically, all you're trying to do here is get all of your pieces onto the board, while blocking your opponents from doing the same, with only one rule dictating the placement of pieces.  Very simple!

The weight and simplicity of rules makes this really ideal for a family game, as you can teach anyone to play and get them rolling in minutes.

Very light and abstract game with simple rules that anyone in the family can easily pick up. Players get a variety of tetris-shaped pieces that they must connect on the board via a single corner. It plays quick but it requires some good spatial thinking and planning to really shine. Best at 4 players, since you need to play with all 4 colors regardless of player count.

One of my favorite abstracts. Amazingly simple rules (You can probably teach this game to anyone in under a minute) but enjoyable strategy. Oh and the pieces are pretty too!

Official two player rules are pretty clumsy. Suggest just downsizing the area of play and sticking with one color (there's some images floating around here on the Geek with suggested start locations/play areas for 2 players that work marvelously.)

Good abstract game.  Don't know why it is for more than 2 players.  Make it 2 players with 2 colors and you have something there.  It'll make you think, but I don't feel it scares those away who are the non-abstract type.  Not very flashy or fun...I would rather play Through the Desert.

Never really understood why people would ever buy Blokus Duo as this game can be played just like Duo. Anyway, it's a decent pure abstract game which I sometimes enjoy and it's always a nice challenge to try and block your opponents. However, it's only for 2 or 4, 3 is imbalanced. However, the facts that the box is quite big, and 2 players isn't funny on the big map (though you can just use the 14 x 14 grid like in Blokus Duo), are the reasons why I've sold it.

My recommended number of players: 4

Surprisingly aggressive, incredibly addictive, always different---everyone loves it! Five minutes into the first game people were saying,"I've got to get this game." Simple, yet thought-provoking. Aggressive, yet playful. Fantastic abstract for people who say they don't like abstracts.

Update 02/2009 - I went and invested in the GIANT BLOKUS because the kids at the school like it so much. Sure, it was a significant chunk of change, but I love it and playing it on the large board makes for great excitement at the end of a make-shift tournement. It has renewed my interest in the game and how it proves to be a real gateway game to getting people to try new games.

Oh baby! Blokus is my new favorite OCD pastime. This game is really only playable as a 4-player game. There are rules to play this with fewer (even a 1-player version, can you say "BORING!") but why bother. Fast paced, simple rules. I mean REALLY simple rules. And no artificial theme pasted on top of the game. Find 3 other friends and play this game!

Just don't nickname your adorable little baby girl after this game. (Are you listening Ryan?!)

Giant Blokus is so much better than regular Blokus. (er..um so much larger than regular Blokus)

Best (only) with 4

RATING: 8
Blokus might be the most approachable no-luck abstract that I've played. It is, at the same time, a family game/gateway game, an abstract game, and an incredibly cutthroat game.

Everyone starts with the same geometric tiles. On your turn, you play a piece "kissing" the corner of one of your other pieces. Can't play any more tiles? Then you're done. Player with the least number of squares remaining wins. That's pretty much the rules.

Very quickly, players realize the various nasty and clever moves that are possible as everyone rapidly competes for space and runs into each other's "kitchen." This game has been a life-saver given the number of times I've played with my in-laws.

The only drawback I can think of is that it clearly plays best with exactly four. Two is fine, and three is something I've not wanted to try. For modern family gaming, this is pretty essential.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is another abstract game that's low on rules but a good brain-buster.  It's very fun to try to figure out how to manipulate the pieces to one's best advantage; one can just see the wheels turning as other players tilt their heads to help them visualize board placements.  (It reminds me of watching other students in physics or math classes try to think through right-hand rules or something.)

This game is definitely fun. But there is only so much effort I want to put into it. That is, I'll try to play well, but I can't get super-competitive about this one. But the weight vs. playing time is right on, so it is a nice filler.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
Enjoyable, light, (can be) fast, solidly zero-sum, visually attractive.  Best with 2 or 4.  The two player game is especially vicious and tight.  Delightful  Three player works, but not as well as the others as the board doesn't get as tight as fast.  Four is very good, and could easily be argued as being as good or even better than the 2 player version depending on personal stylistic preference.  My first preference is for the two player game's deliciously balanced decision trees.

Update: The two player game is possibly my favourite of all games.

Before a mini Eurogame invasion, this used to be the best game that you could buy at Target (except for maybe Cribbage). This has become one of my go to gateway games when introducing casual gamers to the joys of the hobby. They always want to play a second game right away.

I bought this to play with my six year old.  On the plus side, he enjoys the bits and the gameplay.  He completely understands the rules and the basics of strategy.  Obviously, the more sophisticated strategies still elude him (cutting off your opponent) but its still fun to play a non-luck driven game with my son.

On the minus side I would never choose to play this game against an adult.  My taste in gaming is not for abstracts or games with meaningless themes.  I like my games to portray something interesting, be it historical, fantasy, or sci fi.

To date, about the only abstract game I can actually stand.

It has nice opportunities for screwing your neighbors, too.  Really only for 2 or 4 players... for 2, I recommend your final score is your worst color.

August 2010 - dropped from an 8 to a 7. My wife likes it less than she did so it doesn't get to the table. Duaghter #2 seems to like it though so we'll see what happens there.

Pretty much the only abstract we own. Good fun with 4 people, not bad with 2.

Weird that it's an abstract that really only works well with EXACTLY 4. With 2 you each play as two players and sum the scores, but there's no real way to play w/ 3. For 2 players, any of the GIPF games are better (or Go or Chess for that matter). Moved rating up after discovering that it was a major hit with the wife (and kid).

RATING: 5
I found this game not particularly appealing when I first played it. The strategical considerations were rather limited and not very interesting; and the end of the game was a drag. It was more of an endless hunt to locate spots where pieces could still be placed. I also disliked the fact that at this stage, the players are playing everyone except themselves because you are so dependent on other people's oversights. Apart from that, the game is exceedingly simple to learn, doesn't feel 'complicated' and therefore appeals to a broad range of gamers. But I'm not particularly keen to play this abstract at any player number.

[b]Update[/b] The above was based on several games early in my 'career' of boardgaming. It was interesting to revisit these old memories in a series of fresh games. Owing to a particularly devious couple of plays by an opponent I realised that it is possible to physically [i]block[/i] another player by making use of the 'reach' of pieces. If I make a push in the horizontal direction, then a long vertical piece placed closely alongside can block several avenues at once: if I try to 'go around' it, the length of the vertical piece gives that opponent sente which I cannot best. There is also a concept of 'thickness' in this game: a long and thin line of pieces is not much of an obstacle, but two such lines placed in close proximity make passage much harder. 

At the same time I remain somewhat unconvinced that one can actually play to use these tactics; I feel that they are more useful in terms of local tactics. Being able to place your own pieces in tight spots is much more advantageous; and thus preventing that others can do that in your territory seems to be more important. This is difficult to achieve... but at least it makes the game a little more interesting than it was several years ago. Upgraded the rating.

I really loved this game.  I have been kind of reluctant to buy it, because it is 30$ and involves putting highly colorful pieces on a board... Actually that seems like it would be the perfect game for me.  And I do like it.  If you like tetris, puzzles or puzzle games this is a game you probably should own.  Now I just need to try the other versions and Gemblo.

RATING: 7.75
My original (low) rating had stupid reasoning behind it.  My gripe was that I had no use for a four player abstract, which is of course not the fault of the game.  And while that is still mostly true, I've since discovered how easily you can effectively convert the game into Blokus Duo.  Now the fact that it supports four is just an added bonus.  

It's a fascinating game, wholly deserving of it's "modern classic" status.  Very satisfying to sneak into the cracks where your opponent is unable to block you.

In fact, I like it so much, I bought the giant version.

This game is very easy to learn and quick to play, which makes it an excellent choice for most any group.  I enjoy that it's simple, yet you can burn your brain on strategy if you're so inclined.

This is the rare mass-market game that is both accessible and incorporates serious strategy at the same time.  A winner that makes a great gift.

Definitely best with 4, but you can make the 2-player version work (alternating turns with 2 colors each).

Components: Very well-made. The pieces fit securely on the board, are easy to handle, and make a satisfying 'clink' sound when played.

Experience: It is interesting watching the board develop, and having to adjust to ever-shrinking options. Borders are even more permeable here than in Go. I enjoy this more than its cousin, Cathedral. But I'm terrible at it, and don't actually enjoy it all that much.

Reminds me of those pretty little Ravensburger games where you had a patchwork of squares printed in different colours. You had to place your shapes (each made in a different configuration of five squares) in such a way that all the squares of just one colour in the underlying grid were visible. Each successive colour gave you a harder challenge. I enjoyed those when I was nine, but not much any more.

On the other hand, the bits are made of bright, translucent plastic. Yay.

Though the bright colours may give the impression of a kids' game, there's a surprising amount of depth and strategy here - enough to rival Hex and Chess.

The politics of multiplayer and the chaos of the first few games disguise this fact, but play the 2-player variant (preferably by blocking off a smaller board and only using 2 colours, as suggested as an official variant online) and the depth really comes to the fore.

Playing 3-player can be lacking and a bit fiddly - 4 colours are still used but players take turns to control the 4th - so I'd only play this with either 2 or 4 total players.

Like the previously mentioned games, the first few games after learning the rules will be full of joy and discovery, soon to be replaced with some memorisation of optimal moves and counter-strategies if you choose to go down that route. It can get a bit dry and heavy.

Thankfully, the simple rules, pretty shapes and 4-player nature make this a great game to play with a new group of friends - or a child old enough to understand the concept of corners and not swallow things - and a new player brings the chaos and joy of discovery back to the mix.

UPDATE (July 07): Finally played the game. This is pretty good fun. Nice thing is that our entire family (four of us) can play on very even terms, making for very competitive games. Wish the pieces fit a bit more securely in the board, as we had one game "altered" when my 13 year old dragged her fingernails across the board and we couldn't remember where all the pieces were originally!

Never thought I'd like this game, as I don't like most abstracts, and especially with as little "going on" as this one.  But I realy enjoyed my one 4-player game of this, and was glad to see I got trounced as the newbie, and saw some of my mistakes partway into the game. I have a feeling I wouldn't like it as much with 2 as it might be too "plain", and I imgaine it would stink with 3 (one person would be stuck between 2 others).

This is a very accessible, colourful abstract that shines in all its glory with exactly four players.  For two players, play the Blokus Duo variant on the shrunk board, and for three players, play Blokus Trigon.  The game looks really nice, it has rules that can be explained to anyone in 10 seconds, and has interesting and very tense flow of the play.  The depth is probably not at the level of the GIPF games, but that doesn't bother me, since the games are still quite unpredictable and exciting, even after many plays.

RATING: 5.75
I'm going to have to buck the trend here and say I don't really enjoy this game.  It looks beautiful.  The rules are elegant which I appreciate a lot.  I want to like it.  It is just that playing it has been a little tedious for me.  Players look at ever one of their pieces and think about every place each of them can go.  Some players take it a step farther and look at every piece of their opponents and how it could affect them if they played each of those pieces.  In the end, this is a political game.  The person that wins is the person who the fewest people fight against.  This design works as a two player game but not as a multi-player game.  For multi-player area creation games, I prefer Through the Desert.

An interesting abstract area control game. I still play it occassionalyl because of its popularity with my family. My mom loves it (I bought her a copy for Christmas one year), and for that purpose it is a blast. I do not see a reason to play it with real gamers though. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Elegant abstract strategy game that works very well. Players attempt to place as many of their 21 pieces onto the board as possible.  Pieces may only touch like-coloured pieces at diagonal corners.  Theoretically there is room for every piece, with some change, however it never works out that way.  Very addictive game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Beautifully simple rules, pretty components.  A nice abstract strategy game for two, or somewhat of a groupthink/diplomacy game with more-- lots of whining when someone invades your turf or blocks your entry into theirs.  So far it's always been a hit when I introduce it to new players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I previously had this rated lower than Ingenious as I've been playing Ingenious more often lately at the request of my family.  But I recently played Blokus Duo which reminded me how fun this game is.  I like thinking about the best way to use the different pieces, and the decision making is more interesting and requires more thought and strategy than Ingenious.  So I've bumped the rating up a bit and am looking forward to getting the 4 player version to the table again.

RATING: 7
Probably my favorite abstract game.  One of the best things about it is that the rules can be explained in under 30 seconds.  Too many games take an hour to setup and explain before play even begins.  This game is also great because it is so tactical.  Trying to decided where to place your polygon to setup your next move while both protecting the area you want to move into from your opponents always keeps players involved.  This is my brother's favorite game.

You can be mean and try and block the other player all you like, but unless you have less blocks by the end you still lose. So there!

If you're good at Tetris, you'll love this abstract that flips Tetris' idea on its head.  You have a set of colored tiles in Tetris-like shapes and you want to get rid of as many as possible.  The main rule is that you can only touch YOUR OWN color on a corner, but it's OK to play alongside OTHER peoples' colors.  Pretty, and great with non-gamers.

Simple and elegant, Blokus is a fun and competitive abstract tile laying game.  The goal is to lay down as many, if not all, of your pieces, while blocking your opponents at the same time.  

The only reason this game isn't quite perfect is because it really only plays well with 4.  With 2 you have to each control 2 colors or you will need to modify the board with unused pieces to shrink it.  There is a thread on the game's page that details how to do this.  Playing with 3 is possible, but the player in the middle does have a bit of a disadvantage.

A set of Tetris like pieces by each player are placed onto a large square, but there isn't enough room for everyone. Someone always gets screwed in the rush to the middle but with two players the board is too empty. A lot of fun, but grew old for me after too many plays.

I try and use the BGG rating system so Blokus fits the "Very good game.  I like to play.  Probably I'll suggest it and will never turn down a game."  I probably will suggest this game to a mixed gamer audience since it is so easy to explain and the games are over so quickly.

What further adds to the appeal is that it is appealing to so many other gamers.  People don't drag their feet to sit down to Blokus because each experience seems to be satisfying to everyone involved and that vibe keeps sustaining itself as we move onto another game at our session.

The only reason I wouldn't suggest this game is that I might want to try something new that I've bought and thus don't bring this along because otherwise it would get played.

The cavets to the game are that I'm not sure if one can really master the game.  Played enough times and with an analytical mind you could get some edge on other players if you can pay attention to everyone elses tiles and twirl them around in your head, but I'd think the brooding to get to that level of competition would suck the light fun out of the game.

Also, it's really only suited for four players.  You can hack two and three player games with it, but with so many other titles out there suited for those number of players it's best to just let this come out when you have four available.

I really like this one.  My only complaint is that the SRP is a little on the high side for what it is and the box is a hard shape to store with other games.  It should probably sell for closer to $20.  Tip: try to use up the biggest pieces early.  They can be a bear to get rid of later on.

RATING: 9
Easily one of our favorite games. Everyone compares it to Tetris, but unless you're playing it very wrong, it has nothing to do with Tetris, despite the fact that some of the pieces look all Tetris-y. Very easy to teach and good strategy. 2, 3, and 4 player games all different, but best with 2 and 4. 

See my review for more details.

This one instantly jumped to my must have list.  I have a soft spot for abstracts, and this one really fits the bill.  I haven't played many 4 player abstracts, but this one seems perfect.  I'll start it at 9 but can easily see it climbing to 10 with more plays.

I wouldn't call this one a gateway game necessarily, because it's cleary an abstract.  Then again, I can't imagine this game pushing anyone away from Euros in any way, so it can't hurt to give it a try.

Dropped to a 5.5.  This is actually one of the few games I own that my wife will play but I don't care for it much

BTW, the 2 player version sucks.  Travel Blokus has issues but it's better than 2 player Regular Blokus.

If you're hosting a game night with several games going on at once, add Blokus to the mix. It's a safe bet when you're expecting a few non-gamers to attend. The simple rules allow people to feel competitive even in their first match. Blokus is also a fun game for kids. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fun abstract that is nastier than the pretty pictures would suggest.  After the initial race to the center of the board, people start getting aggressive with blocking and trying to capture territory.  It's always fun escaping to a new area when it appears you are trapped.

A good abstract strategy game that can be played by a wide range of ages. My family doesn't seem to be into abstract games, so it hasn't gotten as much play and then a piece was lost, so we haven't played it in a while. Box and storage is a little unwieldy. Bright colored pieces are like Tetris candy and appealing. Acquired from FLTS (friendly local toy store).

I remember playing this game a ton with family because my mom was really into it and it's 4-player specific nature worked great with her, me, and my 2 brothers. It's certainly my favorite abstract strategy game I've played as of the writing of this comment. The 4-player nature balances out players of different skills levels as the better players will face more resistance from the others. Can also be played as a wonderful two-player game with each player taking two colors. Spatial and puzzly with very interesting opportunities for strategic planning as the board closes up.

Discovered this game at a teacher store, then decided to buy it after reading more about it.  A great game, and anyone we have introduced this game to has enjoyed it as well.  It is also a big hit with my nephews and can usually draw them away from the video games.

RATING: 10
Wow, instant classic. Simple enough to teach in a minute, but incredibly complex. It's just strategy and squares.

Nearly all plays of this has been two player, as I don't think of suggesting abstract strategy games beyond two players. 

This is the "I want to do this, this, and that with my turn, but I can do only one thing" game down to its lowest common denominator (I mean that in a good way) 

Oh and after playing this and travel blokus over 60 times, I FINALLY got all my pieces down, even with the one piece last! Nice!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Good abstract similar to Rumis and Ingenious.  What's fun about this game is your own plays really limit your opponents' field of possible plays.  Not something I'd want to play all the time, but good fun for a relatively quick abstract spatial game.

RATING: 7
[2 plays regular, 1 Duo] I'm not usually a big abstract fan, but I like this one.  I like the sense of urgency; as opposed to something like chess, where there are many many possible moves, and you have to foresee which one will lead down the best path, here the universe of choices diminishes rapidly, and you have more of a feeling of running around the board putting out fires, or "I must do X while I still can!"  The agony of decision is not "What shall I do" but rather "I really want to do A, B, and C immediately, but which one is MOST urgent for this turn?"  And Blokus plays quickly, which is nice.  The standard board is easily modified to play Blokus Duo (the 2-player "travel" version), so unless you actually want a little one to travel with, buy the original game and you've got both.

I enjoy Blokus solely as a 4-player game. With 2 players controlling two colors each, there's very little player interaction until midgame. It's basically a race to get to the center of the board, then cut off as many of your opponent's routes as possible. Having four players forces much more confrontation early and keeps the game interesting.

[b]Update:[/b] Dropped from a 6 to a 5. There are so many better games to play, I really don't enjoy this one much anymore.

RATING: 7
Doesn't heat up until the board starts to fill up, but it gets pretty exciting once it does.  Often will want to kick yourself for arbitrarily using a piece earlier that exactly fits a space available later on.  Nothing more satisfying that managing to get rid of tons of pieces late in the game by slipping them around everyone elses.  As an abstract, this game definitely makes it feel like I'm exercising my brain in a different way than in normal games.

Played 4 times. It's abstract, so I'll never adore it, but it sure is a neat concept. Think Tetris crossed with Tron, with 4 people playing on the saem board, and you'll have an idea of this game. The only thing I don't like is how important it is to hamper your opponent's options by stealing their corners points. I guess I was hoping it won't be quite so combatitive. =) [Thrift. Sell.]

Quirky fun strategy game.  It says 2-4 players.  Its not.  Its really 4 players only. There's rules for 2 and 3 players, but the game is essentially ruined that way.  This limits it greatly because you can only ever play it when you've got exactly 4 players.

Other downside is that some of the pieces seem really easy to lose, and there are absolutely zero spares.

(Based on online play) Blokus is a simple tactical pure abstract. Players fill up a board with pretty, colored pieces, but the rule is that pieces may only be placed touching the corner of another piece. Simple, inoffensive tactical game, but doesn't present anything to bring you back for more. Bored with it after a few games. (See the Gipf series for more interesting abstracts.)

This game knocked me for a loop when I was introduced to it. It had more of a "Wow!" effect on me than many other games I have encountered. It is a gem!
I love the simplicity, beauty, and challenge of this game. Blokus is similar to GO in that 6 year olds can play with hardcore gamers. I enjoy the thought that this will take me years to perfect. It is a 'Tetris' like brain burner where you fight for space with the other 3 players

This game is beautiful! Try the two-person variant or play in two teams. Every shape (of a certain color) exists only once. It would be possible to write a book about each piece describing its unique character. Blokus is also a game of balance and it takes much time to gain mastership.

RATING: 7
A nice little abstract somewhere in the ballpark of Ingenious, but less idly comfortable and more actively confrontational. Works well with four players, too, although it suffers a bit if the playing field isn't at least approximately level.

RATING: 7
PRO - Another great game to play with the family.  Rules are very simple. While kids might have a disadvantage in the strategy department, I think they have spatial reasoning on par with adults.

CON - Some people don't like abstracts?  I don't know, this is a pretty solid game for me.

I just love this one, I played at work (at my lunch time of course!), it is so adicting and challenging.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
 Super easy game-play. Excellent and fairly deep strategic play. Works best with even # of participants. Otherwise(such as in a 3 player game) players alternate playing the unused color.  Careful to keep everyone thinking about their next move, otherwise it can slow down a bit towards the end game.

RATING: 7.5
Easy to teach game.  I particularly enjoy the last half of the game where well laid plans are dashed with every piece placement.  My only suggestion would be to avoid playing this game many times (i.e. 7-10) in a row as it will lead to brain burn and you will have dificulty bringing out another game.

People like this game so much, but I just don't get it.  I think I need to play it more.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Almost as fun as its little brother, but can be somewhat chaotic due to three players having turns before you get another.  It's easy to have avenues unexpectedly cut off before you get another turn, making planning more difficult.

It is certainly more casual feeling because of this, and I'd recommend this for "lighter" gamers than Travel Blokus.  Travel Blokus is just *mean*.  But I like it that way.


UPDATE:  The 7 is tenuous, may slip a bit.  

UPDATE:  I guess this holds its 7.  As an abstract and party game, it's a success...people see it, they want to play it.  It's colorful and looks attractive on the table.  As abstracts go, I have to give this game some credit, because abstracts in general suck.

Only a handful of two player sessions, but given the populous nature of this game, I was trying to be unimpressed.  However, its does seem to be a bit more interesting than expected. I think will be a nice longer testing filler  (10/12/08).  UPDATE: It has just sat there all this time.  Not a fan of the end game, more a method rather than a game.  No desire to play or share it (Rating 5; Dec 2014). UPDATE: Sold CanCon (Jan 2015). 3SF 4.744 Jan 17.

Blokus is a wonderful spatial game that is quite pretty to look at once all the pieces are on the board.  Challenging and simple fun to play, the great thing about Blokus is that it can be introduced to anybody, and everyone feels like they are making gains and learning from loses.  Almost 2 decades later and it is clear that Blokus is one of the more significant abstracts of this generation and indeed a classic.  The greatest downside is that it is 4 players only: the 2-player rules are not great and the 3-player rules are a joke.

This game makes me think a lot of an older game I have called Skirrid (with placing of plastic shapes). The game play is different, but physically similar. This game gets a lot of high ratings. I didn't really enjoy it much. It is a super easy game to learn and would be a great starter game for the night. It takes all of 10 minutes to learn it. Strategically it's a monster. I prefer Skirrid over this one. There's just so many other cooler games I'd rather play.

A wonderful multi-player abstract game.  The rules, as they should be, are simple and easy to grasp.  

An interesting aspect of the game is that initially, placement can (if you let it) take some time.  There are lots of options.  However, as the game wears on, and the # of pieces you have to choose from decreases, so do your options, thus the pace of play increases.  This is nice, as the people that are "eliminated" don't have as long to wait until they can vindicate their loss.

Blokus is a fun and nice looking area majority game, where players try to get all or most of their pieces on the board, while trying to block others from doing the same. It's a fun game to play once in a while and makes for a good introductory game that plays quickly.

An enjoyable abstract strategy. The rules are just about as simple as they can be, yet they provide lots of freedom for players. Seems to be hard to develop an overall strategy since the board can change completely within couple rounds, but finding creative and clever moves to help yourself and hinder others is very satisfying. Not to mention the solitaire version that manages to provide surprisingly good entertainment when you are into some lonely brain-wrecking.

I'm not very good at abstract games but this one is fun. I bought it before I broke into the hobby. It's biggest problem is that it plays best at 4. The two player variant is okay but I don't typically play it unless I can get a full compliment of players. It's fun to play with my 10 year old son.

RATING: 7
Blokus is one of the first modern boardgames I played, and it was so good that it increased my interest in finding other games. It works well as a two-player game (either by having each player use two colors or by reducing the playing area). The rules are easy to teach and remember, but over-analysis can be a problem. The game incorporates zero luck and requires heavy skill in spacial arrangement, a skill that I have in abundance and my husband does not have at all. He has never won a game against me yet, but he always has a good time. Component quality and tactile enjoyment are  excellent.

good spatial reasoning kind of game. easy to teach and even easier to learn. it's definitely the type of game where you can expect the young padawans you teach it to, to surpass you in the immediate subsequent rounds! my choice of game to play with friends at a cafe over some delicious boba! the ultimate game of cockblokus-ing.

I like that Blokus can be played either as frivolously or as attentively as the group desires.  The attractive presentation, minimal rules, easy play, and short duration allow it to succeed in a wide variety of settings.  I know some folks like it with two players, but I prefer the four-handed game.

After one play, this was a lot more fun than I thought it would be. I'd had the pieces-to-board proportions wrong in my head. I thought you would just play a couple of pieces and the board would be filled. Turns out that, with a little craft, you can sneak a whole lot of pieces onto the board mixed in with everyone else's. Really should play with 4 to get the proper effect. Play the Travel version if you have only 2 players. Play Trigon or Gemblo if you have 3.

Purchased in January of 2010 for half price at Sears.

RATING: 8
I am not a big fan of abstracts, when I play them; I usually prefer those that have few elegant rules. Blokus definitely is simple to learn, but has a great amount of depth to it and it actually gets better with subsequent plays, when you have an understanding of the basic strategies. It’s a perfect information game and with two players the better player will win every time. With four players it is more chaotic that make that everyone at least can feel that they have a chance of winning. 

I have played it with three players, but don’t recommend it at all. There seems to be a definite advantage to the player sitting opposite to the dummy player.

Tendency: I expect it to stay at a 8, but it might improve to a 9.

Deeper than it looks ... overall I think I slightly prefer the two-player travel version, but the full game provides a different set of challenges with four. I like how the game breaks into acts, opening with a race to the middle, followed by a trading of blows to cut off the enemy, and then a closing act of optimization where you can only be so strong as the foundation you built in the early game. Can turn nasty (in a good way).

This is a very fun game for such a simple concept.  It plays quickly, but it still feels like there is strategy there.  The only drawback is that it only works with 2 or 4 players, the 3 person varient in the rules is broken such that it punishes whoever is 'between' the other two real players.

This is a truly fantastic abstract.  And I was very impressed to see my 5-year-old niece being able to grasp the concept of connecting your pieces to each other only by their corners, but that it was okay to touch sides with your opponent's pieces.  I would have thought that this would have been to complicated for her, but she's quite clever.  Mind you, her strategy was a little chaotic, but that didn't make it any less fun to play with her!

Not my normal style of game (not even my normal style of abstract game) -- very spacial, and requires you to visualize the pieces as they would fit on the board, akin to solving a jigsaw puzzle.  It does have a delicate mix of tactical vs strategic decision making.  I'm not totally sold on it, but the fact that almost every play is agonizing shows there's something here.  It's certainly better than my first impressions led me to believe.

Having played Blokus: Duo multiple times, I felt right at home playing the full version of the game. The tiles are the same, the rules are the same, even the strategies aren't too far removed (unless you play with a group that has a strong negotiation/coercion factor in its table-talk). However, the fact that I rate this game lower than it's little (and by little I mean both younger and smaller sibling) tells me about my preferences about how I like abstracts: in short, I prefer to have a bit more control. This is not to say that I do not like a bit of gamer-generated unpredictability. Some of my favorite games are perfect-information games that can be rather chaotic between one turn to the next (e.g., Torres, Maharaja). Simply put, I have pre-expectations about abstracts, and how they should be played: 2 players, and controlled/controllable.

Much of what I read indicates this is best with four, or with two players using two colors each, but I haven't played that way. My rating is for two players with one color each, which is just not interesting enough to bother with. Maybe someday I'll try the other way and reevaluate.

A quick yet absorbing abstract strategy that can be played and enjoyed by a range of ages.  I think its "enjoyable half-life" may be a bit limited, and there are other abstracts I now prefer (e.g., Yinsh, Gemblo, Ingenious). (Personal backstory: I credit this game with getting me back into boardgames in a big way.  I was introduced to it by my 4-year old niece, liked it so much I went to buy it, couldn't find it at local stores, and discovered BGG after an internet search for Blokus.  I found such a wealth of other potentially interesting games that I never got around to purchasing the one that set me down the path - I now own it after receiving it as a gift.) 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I expected little, but this is really good!
The pieces are great, the strategy is deep & even if you loose you wanna instantly have another go :)

Way more fun than ingenious (einfach genial) because it's easier (the situation dosen't change so quickly), quicker (because you don't count points all the time) & more intuitive (everyone has it's own color). Also you keep your pieces & don't get any new ones, wich makes ingenious way more luck-dependant.

Lowered from a 9 to an 8.  I still feel the below comments apply but felt a 9 was too generous in comparison to other 9s I've given.

After playing through a few times with 2-players, this is a simple but elegant game.  Trying to weave your two color's pieces together for maximum points while simultaneously trying to block your opponent is not an easy task.  As we see the pieces in different places and uses, we're finding that some have stronger areas than others.

There's a fair amount of depth for a basic puzzle-esque game of putting shapes on a board.

This is a good game with 4, and a good game with kids.  The concepts are easy to understand, and you can "handicap" easily by removeing some of your opponent's larger pieces.  It is quick and visually appealing.

That being said, the down side is that the game is what it is, and that is not very deep.  I put this in a simmilar category with Cathedral (which I have a hand-made set) for Go style area control at quicker game times.  I would not recommend this game for anyone who wants deep, theme rich play.

This is a classic abstract. Easy to learn, but hard to master. It feels like a light-cycle race, as players race to the center, laying down pieces to cut off others, blocking them in, and efficiently placing an assortment of pieces on the board. Accessible to both young and old.

シンプルルールで、運要素がないにも関わらず軽いプレイ感で楽しめる。タイルごとの特徴をうまく利用しつつ、手元のタイルをマネジメントするのが楽しい。
盤面においては置く場所に縛りがあることで直接的なインタラクションをうまく和らげている。

Nice game for little nightly get-togethers. Excellent game when played with 4 (or 2) players, 3 player game is not for me.
Also great game to finish play-sessions since the games are fast and they require little-to none thinking / planning.
Last time (after 2 games of Euphrates & Tigris) we created stop-clock rules, tiles must be placed within 10seconds, that turned to be excellent rule-variation and tile-placement became not so optimized.

Box differs from image.
With 2 players, use the Blokus Duo setup: block off a 14 x 14 grid on the board (use the 2 unused colors for that) and place your first piece so it covers the square that is 5 squares diagonally in from your starting corner (players start in opposite corners). Then play as usual, 1 color per player.

Ridiculously good for a game that really only has 2 rules. This really is a game you can play with anyone: family, children, the elderly. You'll need spatial awareness and lookahead skills to play well, but anyone can have a go. Shares the problem of many multi-player combative games in that if more than one player picks on you, you'll do badly as you can't respond to 2 threats with 1 piece. Outshone now by the Trigon variant, but I still turn to this for casual play.

Fun, colorful abstract game.  It is up my alley because it is a visual spatial game.  I prefer games like Blokus to party games or games where you have to re-arrange letters or words.  I do, however, also prefer my crunchy, heavier Euro games to Blokus, which is simple.  Blokus would be a great game to play with children, provided they have matured past the point you would need to be concerned with them choking on the parts.

A deceivingly simple game that plays well for all ages and gamers/non-gamers alike.

A highly pleasant four player spatial game. The aesthetics of Blokus are delightful, and I find that I enjoy the abstract renderings it creates almost more than the game.

The game itself is pleasantly nuanced, without a lot of clear direction for how to play well. There are principles to follow, but no obvious moves that I have stumbled across yet. This is my favorite type of strategy space, so I tend to like it quite a bit.

Apr08: I finally played the original, after playing Travel and Trigon many times.  And the verdict is: not that impressed.  Believe it or not, the components felt cheap compared to the others.  The pieces had spures and the board was flimsy.

Additionally, I just so much prefer the gameplay of Trigon.  The added number of possibilities and number of ways to touch just really make the game for me.  Regular Blokus was still a great game, just not as good as what followed.  If you're on the fence, just go ahead and buy Blokus Trigon, I doubt you'll regret it.

Superb game.
It can be played light and fast, but on the other hand it's deep and winning in it requires really really well-thought moves.

I tested 4-player mode and two variants for 2 players (each player having 2 colors and play on reduced (14x14 squares) board).  They ALL work GREAT.
3-player variant definitely needs some elaboration on rules.

Excellent casual game.  It can get pretty intense towards the end.  Only fun with four players, though.

RATING: 7
Nice little light abstract game for 2 - 4 players that reminds me of tetris and feels very puzzle like. Scores some points for scaling well and playing fast, some screw you, a little strategy and just enough tactics to keep you interested. With 4 this is a good little filler, with 2 the travel blokus game is better really.

Update: 7 => 7.5, this is one of the best and fastest light filler games I have played, 2 players playing 2 colors works very well also. 

Update: 7.5 => 7 Bought Blokus Trigon instead, see BT for the best in the series

Tof abstract spel met tetris-achtige figuren die je in je beurt moet aanleggen aan je eigen kleur, zodanig dat ze in minstens 1 hoek raken. Strategisch, beetje ruimtelijk inzicht, duurt niet te lang. Leukst met vier, dan ligt het bord erg vol en ontstaat er plaatsgebrek.

This a great game for 4 players. It's abstract but very fun nonetheless! It never fails to surprise as you never know you might miss a small opening or when/where your opponents will make a push. It does have limits however. While it's great for 4-players and it's ok for 2-players (I'd suggest the travel version instead), it's not good for 3-players at all.

Good game.  The best feature is the ease of explanation.  You can sit down with three new players and be playing within 5 minutes.  Two problems - the game really requires 4 people, and a bad player can let someone else win.

Update:  Upgraded 1.5 points due to the gateway factor.  I played two games back to back with my wife and in-laws.  It was a hit.  The speed of play and lack of complicated instructions makes it a great game for non-gamers.

Blockus is a game that is fine once in a while. It's nice to play with someone that is used to 'simpler' games (but Blokus is in no way simple...), and it can be used as a good gateway. 

The version I have is large-ish, and difficult to transport, as I have games that I'd much rather break out.

I can't stand the way that some people pronounce the name of this game - "Blow-kus".  I'm sorry, I much prefer "Block-us". There are "blocks" in the game.  Unless we've been playing wrong, there's no "blowing" in the game.

Other than this personal hang-up, I do enjoy this game.  Good for non-gamers.

Given my interest in abstract strategy games, I am amazed that this has avoided my gaze for so long. The wrong has been righted now, I have played many games, and Blokus receives a clear 10. A brilliant game. I look forward to trying the triangular version.

RATING: 7
Abstract shapes game.  Brilliantly simple to explain, but very deep, at least at the tactical level.  The four player version suffers a bit if there is one or more sub-par players in the group.  Very pretty.

The play runs counter-intuitively to my natural tendency to try for the most efficient packing of a space.  Turns out that that "strategy" has serious flaws in this game.

I'm not one for abstract games... and Blokus didn't grab my interest like Ingenious did.  It's a nice abstract game that reminds me of a combination of Sudden Death! and Skirrid,  only slightly better than the others.  To pep up your games... use the Sudden Death timer.  Will play only occasionally.

Plus, 2 of the peopl were non-gamers and they asked right away to play another game, then another one!  That's quality.

Simple game vaguely reminiscent of Go in that you control territory and create "safe" formations, involves strategy and tactics, and even has an early, middle and late game.

RATING: 8
A very addictive and compelling abstract game and one that reminds me of the basic strategies used in Cathedral & Go using Tetris-like tiles in which you place the larger pieces first while securing enough territory to contain future tiles, respectively.  Recognizing the fine line between playing aggressively and defensively is crucial.  Control and efficiently utilizing the center as you work your pieces into other quadrants while shutting out your opponents advances.  We also own the 2-player travel edition(s). 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Fill in the board using Tetris pieces — but your own corner to corner, not side by side. Score based on pieces left when there's no more capable of being put on, lowest score wins. Not a bad game to start, but it's one or two plays and then back in the box to gain dust on it until you decide to try it out again. Little kids will enjoy it as much as adults.

PLUS: unique game pieces
MINUS: strategy is age dependent, requires 4 players (or 2 playing 2)

Blokus is one of those games that actually fits the description, "Takes minutes to learn to play but a lifetime to master."  It's a fun enough game... and yet... I'm not crazy about it.  I don't know.  Maybe it's the production values or the plastic, but it feels like White Trash Tetris.  I'm not crazy about the board or the pieces or the purpose for playing the game in the first place but I mean, Hell, even checkers has a more interesting back story.  A fun game for small children and lab monkeys.

You have 21 pieces composed of a 1-5 squares in various shapes. Each player starts in a corning and then on each turn plays pieces that touch only at a corner. You can cross over other players. Whoever has the least pieces left is the winner. Generally you want to get rid of the larger pieces first. It is a fun, light strategy game.

RATING: 6
Attractive abstract for two or four players. I haven't played it with three but the rules for three players feel improvised. Possibly, not the deepest abstract but one of the best-looking. It has the big advantage that it can be played with gamers who usually dislike abstract games as well. With four players it can happen that two players gang up on the player between them and take him out of the race for the win even if he's a stronger player. Once the players are experienced enough this shouldn't happen as this will mostly lead to a win for the fourth player. The reasonable choice probably is blocking the player behind you in the turn order.

A colorful abstract multiplayer puzzle. Players join their pieces diagonally to try to claim the most territory so that they can rid themselves of their pieces. Its tense and fun, but the replayability is low since the pieces are the same for all players.

[Update] For scalability (different number of players) I think Blokus Trigon works better. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a tremendous game to play with children or those who don't play games that often, because of the simple rules and the colorful pieces.  I like that the best strategy is to go all over the board rather then having each player stay in his own corner, which makes the game dynamic and just frustrating enough.  The only thing about Blokus that annoys me is that the early game isn't that exciting and that in my experience players take a long time to play, even in the early going, which makes it far less exciting.

An abstract puzzle game with a very simple 'Tetris' like feel to it. Completely strategic, however if two people decide you aren't going to win it is very hard to get out of your corner and have a good time.

Horrible when played with 3 people, either play 2 or 4 players. It does have a solitaire mode where you try to get every piece on the board.

A nice variant is to play 'co-op' with the game and use the solitaire rules with multiple players and see what score you can achieve as a group.

RATING: 8
Blokus is a game I picked up because I wanted to play something that mimic the simplicity of Monopoly and Sorry.  My game group loves Sorry for the "take that" factor and the simplicity of Monopoly.  We actually hate Monopoly, but before my craze with games, they didn't know any better.

So with the direction of Scott Nicholson, I picked up a copy at Target.  For $20 it was cheaper than online retailers...

The game is great because it is easy to learn, fast paced, and filled with strategy.  There is a huge amount of hatred passed off in a good sense by blocking routes, there is great joy to have when you escape to land into the opposing player's reserved area to lay your huge blocks.

Players that I've played with have NEVER stopped at two games, let alone one...  We always play multiple of this and they ask to play again in the future.  With the lack of math, short down time, AP remedied by planning ahead during down times, this game is a perfect mix of fun / back stab for my group...

I'm not giving it a 10 because as timeless as this game will be, it lacks a solid theme.  The overly simplistic ways of the game fails to capture my attention past three games in a row (which can be played in less than the time it takes to play a game of Power Grid).  Also, player skill varies too much for players that take the game TOO loosely.  I haven't played with groups that take the game more seriously, but I guess if that ever happens, the game would bring a new challenge on itself, but right now it feels like Tetris on level 1...  Although fun to make a tetris, the game is too easy...

Still, 8 for a solid game I wouldn't hesitate to suggest to play...

Blokus is a good little abstract game.  Easy to teach, doesn't take long, nice pieces.  My only issue with it is that I think there's more luck involved than anyone cares to admit.  It's pretty impossible to form and execute a cohesive strategy.

初心者から楽しめるアブストラクト。カルカソンヌのように短時間で楽しめるが、拡張ルールがないことと、ピースがなくなりそうな点が怖いので点数辛め。
初めは緩いが、後半は頭を使う。初めから厳しくしたい場合には二人でDuoルールで遊んでいる。
コンポーネントが美しいため、アブストラクトの無味乾燥な部分を補ってくれるようだ。
しいて欠点を言えば、3人プレイが平等でないところと、開始直後のピースの使い方に意味があるのか疑問なところ。Duoのようにいきなりたたき合いの方がルールとしては満足する。

Just discovered this game. Nice little game. One of my new favorites (no set up time, explains in 30 seconds, plays in about 10 minutes). My daughter (8) is really good. 

Edit: I love that I can play with my daughter (now 9) and get a challenge.  She really gets this game.  The only problem is that the game shines with exactly four players.  Forget playing with three (although it's not horrible taking turns playing the dummy player).  With two you might as well play Duo.  But with four, it's great!  You have to worry about all three opponents.  After playing tough computer opponents via the PSN, I've upped my rating to a 9.

This might be my favorite game of all time (assuming you have 4 and only 4 people). It's very easy to learn, plays semi-quickly, and is deeply engrossing. It may look almost juvenile but it's a brain-burning game. There isn't much downtime and what downtime there is spent in thought; as a result the game feels much quicker than it probably is (about an hour). It also creates a beautiful board when the game is done. 

If you have 6 players I'd suggest Gemblo (if you can find it); it's almost the same game but based on the hexagon rather than the square.

EuiSoungにプレゼントしたついでにプレー。他にもプレゼント。自分も欲しくなり購入。
攻撃は最大の防御。自分の陣地を守ろうと思って防いでも、案外自分の陣地には置ける数が限られるので、あまりメリットなし。それよりも行ける範囲を増やす攻撃が良い。
置くときは角と角を合わすよう（向かい合うようにではなく）に置き、防がれないようにするのがいい。3人の場合はランダムプレーヤの対角が不利？横への展開が防がれがちか。
全員が全部置ければ勝ちという協力ゲームにもなる？

Acquired in 2005. Total number of plays = 15. Abstract, spatial game with neat little tactical moves where you fight to create space for yourself while reducing the space of your opponents. The unique piece shapes make the game interesting. Only drawback: it plays well with just four players (and not so well with two or three). Ingenious, on the other hand works well from two to four, which may explain why Blokus hasn't seen much play lately.

RATING: 6
Fun if you like this sort of thing.  Short, wholly abstract, good pacing.  For me, there's no specific source of interest.  There's no theme, and if there is any complexity, it will be the kind that is best exploited by long, careful, meticulous planning.  Like Chess.  This is, however, more colorful than Chess.

RATING: 5.5
Elegant and beautiful! Players place "tetris-like" pieces on the board to carve out space and block your opponents.  The player who gets the most of his pieces out wins.  This is probably my favorite abstract strategy game; it is a simple but difficult to master.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Blokus is a solid 4-player abstract - there are very few such abstract games available. Quick to learn, quick to play, and fortunately, easy to pick up at stores. Added bonus - it really can be played by kids as young as 5 (though they ought to be pretty smart 5 year olds that haven't had sugar for a day or two). But it's only so-so for two, and just not meant for three players.

This is a great short game, one of the best fillers out there. It is a brain teaser and it is fun to try different approaches out at the beginning. It's not fun when one player gets singled out though and they have no chance of winning, which can happen.

Very addictive. I have a lot of trouble recognizing the vulnerabilities I create when I lay a piece, and simply don't do very well at this game, but it is a lot of fun. I prefer it with 4; with the 2-player version is harder to concentrate, since you have 2 colors to play, and therefore too many possible offensive or defensive moves to consider at one time. Whenever I play this more than once in an evening, I lie awake in bed visualizing the board being filled with pieces. There must be some optimal opening set of plays, but I haven't come close to finding it yet.

RATING: 7.5
Good quick fun that just about anyone can appreciate with 4 players. Placing one piece on the board each turn, players try to get all of their own pieces into play before the board fills up. The player with the least un-played piece sections at the end is the winner.

The only drawback is that this game only works well with 2 or 4 players. With 3 players it seems kind of awkward since all 3 players take turns controlling the fourth color. One advantage of Blokus Trigon over Blokus is that it doesn't share this issue.

Being myself a great fan of tetris, I have been wanting to play this one for a long time. I knew that the only resemblance with the video game were the similarly shaped pieces, but had to try it. Now that I have, I was pleased with it, but just didn't grabbed me.

Blokus is, if you haven't guessed by yourself, a pure abstract where long term strategy is the only thing that counts. Should I try to block my opponent? Open a scape route before the block me completely? Which piece should I play and which should I save for later?

Obviously, the most important quality to play this one is spatial vision or the capability to insert a weird piece in a weirder spot while maximizing your benefits. Thankfully, the components are great and help a lot in the labour.

All in all, a clever abstract that can be a true winner with gamers and non-gamers alike, as it's easy to learn and straightforward, yet deep. If you don't enjoy abstracts but want to try this one because of its apparent similarities to Tetris go ahead, but most likely it won't change your mind.

for Blokus Duo:
- use 14x14 area of the 20x20 board
- starting spots (5,5) and (10,10)
(where corners are (1,1) and (14,14))

Solid area control game, very accessible to new players.  More than a few players have bought Blokus for themselves after being introduced to it.

Sadly turn order is probably the most important factor in the game, as following poor play offers as much reward as playing cleverly oneself.

Blokus is a nice simple abstract strategy game.  I tend to find abstracts to be initially intriguing, but lacking in fun after the first few plays.  For me Blokus followed the same pattern.

[2007.Apr.12] A very interesting abstract game. The tile laying mechanic is extremely simply, yet it is by no means easy to "win" the game. This is definitely a rules 'light' game. I would have scored higher (7 or 8), but the game only truly shines with 4 players. (Travel Blokus is designed for 2 players.) The ability to play online for free at: http://www.blokus.com is a great way to learn the game.

It also helps that we have GIANT Blokus which is just beautiful when completed and makes you feel like you're completing this giant maze of colors and objects.  You can really get lost in it, in a good way!  I'll see if I keep enjoying it as much as I have at first.

A wonderful abstract game which I often describe as "multiplayer Tetris".  Extremely easy to learn (literally in 60 seconds) as only you try to connect/touch on your own corners and never connect/touch along your own edges (opponent's edges are ok).  I found that it has a special universal appeal with casual gamers, non-gamers, kids or gamers alike.  It's easily one of my favorite gateway games to introduce others with.

RATING: 7
Impressions for the first two games:

- The first 2/3rd of the game are uneventful, with everybody scoring the same way. Moves are easy tactically, but some strategy might be useful. It feels like decisions don't matter to much, that there is room for many valid options.

- The last 1/3rd of the game depends partially on how luck, because the specific shapes left by the opponents is often not pre-meditated. A few good tactical moves are possible, where one makes sure that the opponent cannot invade a territory, or when trying to invade another territory.

$ Not bad, but I prefer the tension of Battle Line, or of Hive, in the category of short abstracts.

Blatantly clunky with 3 players.

It also has the unpredictability of what the people next to you do.  So you oftentimes win the game because the toughest player sat ACROSS from you so you just got to compete with the easier players who don't block you as much.

I enjoy Blokus a lot. It was a very solid and different addition to my collection; however, it's just not as fun for me as other abstract strategy games.

"Oh a boardgame version of Tetris" , how often did I have to hear this. Well it looks a bit like it, but it's not! Blokus is one of my favourite short games. It's explained in a minute and played in 15. I think it looks nice and plays well. Different strategies are possible (e.g. aggressive vs. cooperative) and both can lead to victory. My only gripe with that one is the format of the box. Couldn't this board have been made foldable?

Starting at a solid 8. I'll adjust as I see how this works with friends and family, as that affects my enjoyment of a game. I like the translucent plastic, and the way they clink like glass. I dislike and immediately tossed (heresy!) the box insert. The board needs felt feet. Looks like there's a chance to get shut out, even early on - counsel new players on this.

12/18 family xmas. Yeah, shut out my sister real quick in our first game heh :). Played with her, a 10 year old and a 5 year old. Justin understood the corner concept but had a hardish time putting it into practice. He's anal though, so he loved it. Everyone enjoyed it. I was surprised at how quickly bits of strategy jumped out at us, and everyone enjoyed the mild brain burn, even sucking in my teenage cousin to watch the board and counsel us.

En un tablero cuadrado, se deben  ubicar las piezas  de manera in interrumpida y conectadas por una esquina,  hasta tocar la esquina opuesta de forma diagonal. Obvio, es importante tratar una estrategia que  bloque el avance de los demás...aunque, no es así de simple.  Rápido, fácil.

With two I prefer the "Duo" setup to the rules included. On a Duo-sized board from opposing corners (instead of mid-board) is pretty good, too. As expected, the three-player game, with a dummy fourth, isn't nearly as fun as 2 or 4. My kids used to enjoy fitting all the pieces together as a puzzle.

Very enjoyable, and normally I'm not that keen on abstract games. But it's fast, not too taxing and nevertheless provides interesting puzzles to ponder, especially near the end.

Perfect for playing outside.  Probably won't ever pull this off the shelf to play inside so it'll naturally be limited in the # of plays it gets per year.  Very fun to think through your various options each turn - finding ways to block your opponent while also finding ways to sneak out to other areas of the board.

Nice to look at, and some good gameplay, too. But I prefer wooden parts and imperfect information in my abstracts, while this has neither. Traded away, and my kids were ok with that. I kept Travel Blokus, though.

Update: Now the game is widely available in Target & elsewhere. I was pleasantly surprised when a some nongamer friends brought it out & suggested a game when we were over for a dinner party. The analytical nature of the game isn't a great match for a party like that, but everyone loved how the game *looked*. (And the simplicity of play/rules).

RATING: 7
I looked up strategies and now we use a standard opening move that works as a very effective barrier against infiltration.  I wonder at the possibilities for variation given the standard opening.  After that point, does winning just become a matter of who can first extend their piece beyond another's barrier while preventing infiltration into their own area?  Does this elevate the game to another level or does it merely stifle the variations?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I prefer Blokus Duo to this variant, since the larger area results in a slow opening (i.e. several moves before players are interacting directly). Plus you get kingmaking, etc. Still solid game though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Great game, but I'm terrible. Only really works well with 4 players. Two is alright if you both play two colors and score a combined total so you are forced to play them both well.

One of the best filler games out there. A lot of games claim to take "2 minutes to learn, a lifetime of fun!" and this is one of the few I've played where that stands true over and over again. I have a soft spot for games with no dice/cards, aka, no luck element. This is pure strategy.

I hate this game. like seriously, haven't we gotten beyond tetris yet? argh, i despised playing this game. The only thing that made tetris worse is making it into a multiplayer board game with cheap components. Reminds me of crappy kids games from my childhood. This game should burn.

I like playing the 2 or the 4 player form. Alternating the 4th color in the 3 player game seems awkward and somewhat forced.


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Good with 4 players. Not good with 3 - not enough competition for space - lots of 3 way ties.

I like Travel Blokus better for 2-player. There isn't enough competition or tension to make this an interesting 3-player game.

Turned out to be a good game with the kids.  Our biological boys took to it right away and the new foster kids (6 and 4) were able to pick it up.  I'm going to try this out with the wife to see if it is something she might be interested in since it's simple and quick.

Blokus is an abstract strategy game.  In it players take turns playing various shaped pieces of their colour onto the board.  The pieces they play must touch their previously placed pieces at the corners only.  The winner is the one who can play the greatest number of their pieces to the board.  It's tricky though, as real estate on the board is claimed quickly.

I like Blokus for what it is, which is a fairly simple abstract game.  If you like this sort of thing, then I'd suggest at least giving it a try.

Only played a few times. The hard part for me starting out was learning to think about the corners of the pieces as playable, instead of the sides of the pieces. Modified my board to include space for Blokus Duo (2-plyr games). See:

Fun!  I have played this as a 2-player each playing two colors but most fun with 4 players.  Love the translucent, jewel colors.

I did learn on this site that the board can be marked off as 14x14 (thanks endersgame)and start each piece 5x5 to play a two player game with the original Blokus board, I'll have to try it.

Completely random for the first half, then its "make a decision on what you have left" from that point on. This game is like that childs toy where you put various shaped pegs into the appropriately shaped hole. That's pretty much it! As pieces dwindle you can begin to make a faint strategy based on pieces they have left and where you can put your pieces to prevent them from using theirs... but again, this is not until the game is nearly over. I tend to like most of the games I play, but my wife and I were disappointed in this game and would not recommend it to anybody except perhaps someone looking to play a colorful, developmental game with their 3 year-old.

I had this game on my "to buy" list for about 18 months...and now I have it.  Um...I can't really remember why on earth I thought I might like this.  I mean, I "get" it, but it's definitely not for me.  This feels kind of like the first time I had duck.  I'd looked forward to it ever since Elaine praised it to the high heavens on Seinfeld (shut up -- I get my culture where I can).  Several years later my plate of promised succulence arrived and it was just, "So THAT'S duck. Huh."  I'll probably neither order duck nor play Blokus again.

09/08/07 Played a four-player game, twice. I'm glad I tried it. Its OK, but I feel no real desire to play it again any time soon. Frankly playing two games back to back made my opinion of it go down, as the tedium factor of sitting on my hands as other players went into analysis paralysis mode was compounded. The games were 31 & 35 minutes, but they seemed much longer.

Another one of those 'meh' abstracts. Theme seems to count for a lot for me. I like fiction, I enjoy telling or being told a story as I play. Whilst I acknowledge that Blokus is pretty neat and has the kind of simple rules set that I like, it's really quite dull.

A game that hits on many fronts for me as being easy to teach and play due to being reliant on geometry rather than special mechanics.  And man, oh man, the 2-player variant can be very thinky (and is becoming my preferred way to play).

Each piece played has a satisfying "clink" sound to it, which being a fan of Go, I like.

My gaming tastes tend towards wargames and away from most abstracts.  However, the area control nature of the Blokus board lends itself to very aggresive play which I like.  For me it's a Abstract Wargame.  I always imagine the game is like competing groups of bacteria in a petri dish or something.

Nice abstract that looks great when played. Simple but great gameplay. Quick game where tension rises during the game. Lots of fun with 4. Plays fast, no noticable downtime since every action might involve your plans. Can only get a bit A.P. prone towards the endgame with the wrong crowd. ("let's see, where can I still fit this part?")

One of the few multiplayer abstracts that is still nice to play after something longer/difficult/thematic. I guess I prefer this over Ingenious for a quick late-night aftergame.

Rating is only valid for 4 players though, drops at least 3 points for 2 and 3 players.

I can't say I've played too many abstract games, but I certainly liked this one as a casual, but strategic, game.  The rules are very simple, but the strategy is deep, and everything depends on the movements of your opponents, so no game ever plays out the same way. Not a game I'd want to play constantly, but definitely one that I would enjoy playing every once in a while.

Pros: Chess-like in a way with each different piece serving its purpose.  Everyone starts out on even footing. Visually stimulating in a way that gives it a 'gateway' click and works as such so long as it's played with other newbies.

Cons:  Like Chess, only at its best when played with equally experienced players. Playing with three is not recommended.

Other: I play this mostly now as a two player (boxed in ala travel edition), which is where an equally skilled player is most important. As that, it's not a game I can introduce someone to for the first time as experience adds a huge advantage (still works well with four as an introduction though).

Best Use: Playing four player (less cut-throat that way) with some abstract newbies.

I love games with simplistic rules yet deep strategy. This game is so easy to pick up and play, and winning the game requires equal parts offence and defence, particularly in 4 player games. Seems to scale down well ok to three players, haven't given two a try yet, but I have the feeling each player would need to grab two colours for the game to remain interesting.

[u]01/08/2013[/u]: Mrs Mo and I like this quite a bit, but our girls...not so much.  This game is really only meant as a four-player game (there are other versions for different player counts), so it doesn't really see very much table time.  If it did, I'd probably move it up a notch in the ratings.  It's kind of like multiplayer Tetris on a board.  I enjoyed puzzles as a kid and still like that aspect in my games.  This definitely fits that bill as you need to fit in various geometric shapes onto the board.  The rules are very simple, as a good abstract should be, and the gameplay is quick and smooth.  I just wish my kids liked it as much as I do.

[u]11-Jan-2014[/u]:  A word about the solo game...growing up, I really enjoyed puzzles: jigsaw, word, logic, and number puzzles.  The solitaire rules for this game reminds me of this time in my life.  I enjoyed playing this game after so many months away from it, and the solitaire rules most definitely fall into the puzzle category.  But, to me, that isn’t a bad thing.  If you enjoy those types of “games,” I think the main solo variant works quite well.  At some point, you’ll be able to solve it and maybe not need to return to it, but until that time, I find it a fun exercise for my brain.

With that being said, I have so many other solitaire options in my collection, I feel I’ll only return to this one when I’m feeling nostalgic for a puzzle game or the next time someone challenges me to play a game collecting too much dust on my game shelf.

This puzzler is more fun than I expected.  A challenging tactical game where your choices (usually) diminish each turn.  You must play defensively to win but allow yourself enough wiggle-room.  Would not want to play with over-analyzers.  UPDATE: I've recently realized that I do not like Blokus as a multiplayer game: that's if you're going to be competitive.  I would however be into trying the partners variant.

Have played a couple of times in the store... Liked Blokus more than I thought I would, given that the pieces are "one of each object with a particular mathematical property". It immediately showed itself to me to be a game about claiming territory, with interesting stuff going on in some of the areas inbetween colors that reminded me of some of the "hot" games in combinatorial game theory. This game would however resist such analysis due to all the different pieces. I would like to play again, but multi-player games with complete information give me the heebie-jeebies, so I bought the two-player Travel Blokus instead. That makes much more sense to me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I really like Blokus (and Travel Blokus) but actually find that it intimidates casual and non-gamers.  I'm not sure why, but these folks seem to decide that it "looks hard".  Consequently I don't get to play as often as I'd like.

This is a great filler abstract game.  Even young children will be able to pick this up fairly quick.  My 5-year-old can play by the rules and do a decent job of competing although she doesn't win.

In blokus each player has a set of tetris like pieces that they are trying to play on the board.  Your score is the number of squares making up the pieces you don't play with 0 being the best score.  Each player must start with a piece on one of the corners, from there on out your piece must touch one or more of your other pieces on a diagonal.  Your pieces can never be next to each other, diagonals only.  You are able to be next to other players' pieces though.  It is called blokus because you are trying to block the other players from having a large enough area to play all their pieces.

The game isn't overly complicated and being able to recognize which plays need to happen now, versus which ones you will have later will really help.  With 4 people that are comfortable with the game you shouldn't be able to play all your pieces very often; however, with new players this might happen somewhat frequently.  This is a great filler that can be taught in less than a minute and most people enjoy it.

Strategic, puzzle board game. Four players take turns trying to place different Tetris-like blocks on a board. Points are counted up at the end based on how many blocks you weren't able to place, and the player with the least number of points win. 

There are variants for less than 4 players, but it's really only good with 4 players.

A very good abstract game if played 2 against 2. I like other abstract games but this is the only one i like to play.
My favorite games are civilization building wargames. Blokus is one of them, if you give it a thought. The most abstract of all. Unfortunately, it seems i am the only one who wants to play this game.
I recommend you prepare your strategy with your teammate:
- where is the attack being concentrated
- where to block, where to create paths for your blocks
- reaction to others strategy
- etc.

This is a good, abstract, beautiful "tile-laying" game.  It gets super tense; and the blocking is incredibly frustrating. It's a little bit too contentious and frustrating for my taste, but still an excellent, elegant game. Possibly the best modern abstract game I've played.

There's a lot to be said for a game filled with tetris pieces made from brightly coloured, transparent plastic!

Blokus is a great abstract strategy game, which appears to have just the right balance (simple gameplay, high strategy and high skill) to make it appealing to hardcore gamers as well as casual gamers alike.

There's lots to consider with each move, and as piece placing will often block opposing player's paths a considerably high screw factor as well.

I've noted that with experience comes a subconsious calculating which is slowly turning each game at our group into a 4 way chess championship!

Despite this it has a light filler/end of night game feeling, making it very accessible. A great game.

I had no idea when I picked this game up for a dollar at Goodwill that I'd happened across an excellent game for myself and all three of my children (ages 13, 12, and 10) to play together.

Pretty simple game that I find pop-up from time to time, and even after several years of not playing, I still know the rules. If someone would want to play this, I would be up for it, but I'm not all too crazy about it either. It's a very satisfying experience to just place your pieces perfectly between other people their pieces.

Do not be misled and think that this game is confrontational! It is not so much about how to obstruct your opponent, but more about how to worm your way into the opponents position and cohabit in that space. In this sense it feels like Go, where every move is a tradeoff and you hope to get the ever so slightly better end of the deal.

The rules are among the simplest there are, lookahead is difficult except for the endgame, decisions are tense (there is always too much to do) and surprises occur often. Probably the best multiplayer abstract strategy game!

This is a good game.  I have not played it much because I'm missing 4 or 5 pieces, which makes it tuff.  I'll have to find a complement set to get the parts I need.  Plays better with 4 people instead of 2

RATING: 5
Its colourful and kid-targeted appearance shouldn't fool you, as Blokus is as brainy as your average positional abstract game. Although I'm far from competent at it, my time spent there makes me suspect there is a fixed optimal opening of 4-5 moves towards the centre of the board, before you interact with any opponent. Now I don't say the game should be setup with these moves already completed, because that would reduce the variety of actual gameplay, but I feel there should be some restrictions in the setup (random first 2-3 pieces that are duplicate for all players?) to prevent staleness.

Anyway as a child educated with Tetris, completing lines, patching holes, filling blanks bore some satisfaction to them; while here my desire for adjacency is the rules' hell. The awkwardness I feel is best described as each player being a gender pushing its members to ridiculous extents in order to maintain acceptance in a ultra-homophobic society. "Touching corners is not rubbing, right?"

RATING: 7
Each player starts with a number of different shapes. The object of the game is to get the most of your shapes onto the board. The only rule is that your play onto the board must be diagonally adjacent to one of your previously played piece. It's a fun interactive game, where you can help your opponents with their placements. For those who are more serious, if you play enough, you will recognize certain pieces that you have, and which shapes you want to put on, or save until the end. There are many tactical blocking opportunities, and opportunities for yourself to find open ground. There is a computer version at www.blokus.com, but I find the board game to be more fun and interactive.

Seems like a great abstract game, but I'm always wary about abstract games. Good mechanics usually aren't enough for me, usually I need a good theme, good components and good feel too. However it provides for a purely skills based 15 minutes with lots of replayability so it might still be worthwhile! If I can find it for a good price I will get it.

Update: played it online, like it a lot but will prefer to stick with it online as I have a number of other games that scratch the same itch but better already at home.

02/2017 -- It's okay. I used to think it was great but it's kinda feeling samey these days. It ends up looking absolutely beautiful when the pieces are all over the place. It's kinda fun trying to squeeze through enemy lines but I've been reluctant to play this game lately.

01/2018 -- I still feel the same as I did almost a year ago. This game is an abstract strategy, but there's not enough strategy for it to match up against the greats. Honestly, if you want an abstract for up to four players where you're having to work your way around each other, Glux is significantly better. 

6 —> 5: still no desire to play it. The game looks beautiful, but it's way too basic

Can get a bit analysis paralysis filled - by far not the best abstract out there, but I can see its usefulness.

That's either good or bad depending on your opinion, I consider it bad.

Despite being a great abstract game for families, it just doesn't scale well for different player counts.

I enjoy it when we play with four. The 2-player version on a smaller surface also works very well. (We have marked our large board to show what the smaller boundaries would be.) But it's a complete pass at 3 players, which is a common number here.

If not for that one problem, I would rate this game higher.

Blokus is a simple, fast, abstract area enclosure game with cheap, yet attractive components. It is inexpensive and easy to find as one of the few designer games to break through to the mass market, so go down to Walmart and pick up a copy today!

My first experience with Blokus was the 2-player Duo version, but I didn't see any point buying that version when I could just buy the full version, mark off a 14x14 grid on the 20x20 board and enjoy both types of play, (with more attractive colors, I might add).

RATING: 6
I would not recommend this game for any less than 4, but for four it is a great, short, puzzle game for non-gamers and gamers alike.  Each person starts off with the same amount of tetris-like tiles that they place on the board corner to corner.  Remember: your tiles can only touch corner to corner, but tiles that do not belong to you can touch anyway you want.  

If you can combine strategy and tactical play to spread your pieces around the whole board, you will have a good chance at winning by placing all of your pieces.  The game is a bit short and your choices are not always the most engaging or exciting choices, however, Blokus is a fast-paced and short puzzle game for anyone to enjoy.

Received as a gift and didn't play with actual humans until a few months later, since we always seemed to be a multiple of 3, resulting in the decision to play Gemblo, instead. I solved pentomino rectangles in the meantime (3x20 & 5x12 down - 4x15 & 6x10 to go...)

Abstract game with tetris blocks. Looks fun and plays fast. Puzzlelike gameplay. Needs 4 players. For 2 player game you might want to test playing [gameid=16395] on your Blokus-board instead.

RATING: 7
Block placement for four players. Always a hit with non-gamers.

With two, I prefer Blokus Duo. The board can be easily used for that as well. With a bit more effort, the board can be used for playing Cathedral, too.

RATING: 7
Light enjoyable abstract that does not take long to play. Can be learned in a minute. Hard to master. If you ask me Blokus plays best with only two players. That way it is less chaotic and you can easily react to your opponent's moves. This makes Blokus really brain burning. With four players there is almost no way of knowing what is about to come after you finish your turn. However, Blokus is not a bad game with four.

[2010/01/01]  +10 plays before recording... 

this is a fun game that you can play and have a great time with "non gamers"...

It's incredibly easy to teach/learn and anyone can be an instantly decent player.. after 1 game they'll be a good player

I like how you can convert this game to blokus duo for 2 plp or you can play the 2 player 4 color version (i've done that twice [extremely fun])

the bigest downside to this game is that if you have "the knack" for strategy (like chess) then you can be a huge a**hole to your opponents... and i love that kind of enviroment... but the "light" gamers that you're looking to envole might not appreciate the more cuthroat playing style

so it's a different game depending on who your playing with.... it can either be a light "lets see who can put the most blocks  down" or an intense "cerebral brain war"

I highly recommend this game, with the caveot that you need to adjust your playing style to your group in order to have a good time.

Looks great, and very easy to teach. Can only be played by 4, and is getting repetitive. Would be great with kids - would sit well with Reversi or Black Box.

They should sell clear boards though, instead of the silver plastic - Blokus would look awesome if it could be illuminated from below.

Really enjoy blokus. We play with 2, 3 or 4 players and your tactics are vastly different depending on the number of players. It reminds us of tetris pieces but its very logical and strategic when deciding what to place where next. Playing with 2 takes just as long as 4 people. Games last about an hour.

I learned "Travel Blokus" first, a two-player game, so when I started playing "Blokus" I was impressed at how it played out with more than two--namely, very differently. I think I like the multi-player version better. I don't rate it higher because of its abstractness, but I think it's a good, solid game, and definitely a brain-drainer. Purchased new for $10 at a local department store in a sale, December 2009.

Best abstract game I've ever played. Best played with 4 but a smaller 14 x 14 grid is ideal for a 1 v 1 showdown. Far superior to trigon in my opinion due to greater opportunities to block opponents (which as its name suggests, is the main gist of the game)

When 3p, ALWAYS play with the ghost player. Otherwise there is not enough conflict.

The partnership game is a cool variant.

Finally played a 4p where I got to play all my tiles AND the last tile was the smallest (Jan 09).  Then, the next game (Feb 09) I again got all my tiles down with smallest last.

Played a 3 player game where each player alternates playing the 4th color.  This works surprisingly well.

One of the best abstract games I've ever played, probably the best. This is also a great easy-to-learn-but-hard-to-master type of game, which makes it great for playing with younger children and adults alike. My only complaint on this front is that, since there are no elements of chance in the game, it might get frustrating for kids to play with adults unless the adults purposefully go easy on them. Thus for child/adult games I prefer there to be some elements of luck.

I own this game, and I like it and would like to play more, but it really is best with 4 players and not so fun (in my opinion otherwise). I have made the board smaller, and that's alright, but, meh, I could see why having 4 people would be better but I don't want to play 2 colors at once.
I would play it more, but it is unfortunately kind of big, so I don't bring it to boardgaming meetups. If I have 3 guests over, though, I would love to play.

For a game that I bought for a few bucks at a Goodwill, this has been a great value for the money. It's not my favorite abstract, not by a mile, but we pull this one out every once in a while and I really enjoy it. It takes like 30 seconds to explain the rules. My two biggest issues with the game is it's officially bad with 2 (although you can artificially tighten the board and make it an interesting game) and its completely unenjoyable for 3 players. It's a 4 player only game which leaves it fighting for FAR, FAR too many games in that category.

I will say though, I'm happy to play if anyone asks.

I don't feel it as such that "great" game as somebody says. The game is beautiful and well made, but it doesn't work very well as a 2 player game, IMHO, and with 4 it strongly depends if opponents decide to move towards your space or not.
----
Update: after all, I feel in the right mood to play this game quite often, being quick and beautiful. The 2 players game is really interesting - as it didn't seem to me before - and the fact of controlling two different colours whose tiles can be adjacent adds a lot to the game. Still, I don't think that's so deep and it strongly depends from others' choices when in 4.

A very easy abstract to teach. Playing consists of blocking the others, so mean playing will be common - think twice before buying this one to play with your beloved family. One hindrance is also the fact that this is only good with four players. I wouldn't try this with less than that since there are different versions of Blokus to those situations.

The game is a bit overproduced: very large and a way too thick board. It looks neat, yeah, but definitely less would've been enough. Now it's just hard to carry around.

I'll have to check the other Blokus titles to give my final opinion about this one, since it's truly possible to give it an eight, but not just yet - I'm not sure enough...

Blokus- or how I lay blokus on the gridus. This isn't a bad game and I'm sure maths enthusiasts love it, because when you have shapes and numbers- Bouyszankerus! I find it to have very little excitement. Sure the blokus blocking is fun, but then you spend an extra 3 minutes planning your move just to be blokus again! It does look very pretty when there are lots of blokus on the gridus. 

Didn't make the cut as there are better games to play, if I want to play an abstract game- Uptown is my go to game! Now that has true planning and excitement!

ALmost never playing this, because it really should be played with 4. Besides that it is an abstract, which doesn't make it a great sell either. It is a really good game though.. 

So a 5 seems to low, but according to bgg, that should be the rating for me.

Nice little abstract that has you trying to place all your Tetris-like pieces on the game board. The hitch is, they can only (and must) touch corner to corner with your color. As you place pieces, you end up blocking your opponent from placing their pieces.

I played this recently with friends for the first time.  Your first thought is Tetris as a board game!  It is a really good abstract game where you have to consider where you want to move to and how you can block off your opponents.  This has certainly joined our wishlist.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
(10+ plays)  An abstract with a very wide audience.  Worth having just for that reason.  Ultimately, basic ability to fit geometric shapes reveals a game with few actual decisions - but still somehow pretty fun.

The kids love playing with the pieces and we/they've made up all sorts of games and activities with it.  We've lost some of the pieces now, so can't really play a real game of it anymore - but it's still fun to mess around with the kids.

RATING: 8

Great logic game. Game is fast and the rules are more than easy but playing the game requires a lot of tactic moves, tries to predict the opponent moves, and a good planning for your own moves to get yourself closer to victory and others as far from it as possible.

Great challenge for everyone. Winning gives a lot of satisfaction as there is no randomness in the game.

Finally got to play this famous game at my local meetup. I wasn't impressed with the game at all. First of all I am not an abstract player. I need at least a little bit of theme in my game. It's an exercise of how we place our tiles better than our opponent in a set frame of simple rules. It should be easy to pick up and hard to master but the 3D puzzle aspect doesn't keep me from coming back.

I only like a few classic abstracts.  So it shouldn't be a big surprise that I don't really understand the huge appeal.  Still, not bad as a 4-player.
Updated:  After several months and many filler plays (often last game of the night), I like this a lot more.  As a non-classic abstract, it gets very high marks, especially because it can handle 4 players.
Floated up over time.  Great finishing game.

RATING: 7.5
This is a great 10-20 minute filler.  There are a lot of tactics and strategy if you play this game with a group that is competitive.   Sometimes, I wish the game was longer or the board was bigger but I have never played a game of Blokus and not enjoyed it.  There are games I like to play more but those aren't the 10-20 minute variety.  The only game that I think currently I would put ahead of Blokus in the 10-20 minute variety would be Santorini and maybe  7 wonders.  This is a very solid game with simple rules that anyone can play.   The only complaints I would have about the game would be that the 3 player version of this is kind of fiddly and there isn't a mechanism in the game to force different styles or opening play.  There are 21 pieces if I remember correctly and the game I think would have more variety if each color had 40 pieces but 21 for the game were chosen at random.  I just base this on the gods feature in Santorini which does an excellent job at mixing up the play.  Good players of Blokus tend to play the same sort of openings over and over and some type of mechinism to change that ,though not really necessary, would help in my opinion keep the game fresh.  All in all, a very solid 10-20 minute brain burner for 2 or 4 players ideally.  I found this game at a garage sale for $2 and it has been by far my best bang per buck game.  I think new at target or walmart it can be found for $10 or so, which for good filler that is decent.

RATING: 8
Nice little game, that fits a whole play in about 15-20 minutes. Easy to learn and teach and everyone seems to have a good shot at making it work. Since the mechanics of the corner positioning allow for users to intermingle their pieces, it is hard to block out other players until later in the game. This makes it hard to plan out your whole strategy (if there is someone good enough to plan this out).

Great abstract game with beautiful components. Good for non-gamers as well. Short. Thought provoking but not weighty. Requires a ton of room, though, as you need to see every single one of every player's pieces. With three players this game offers a VERY interesting twist--players take turns controlling a fourth non-player. This way, the game offers opportunity for interesting long-term and short-term planning and decisions. Though I will admit, you should put the best player between the other two live players.

This is a perfect game for playing with new people, as there isn't much explaining to do.  The concept is unique and fun, it's kinda like playing a weird competative tetris.

RATING: 6
One solo play, aim being to get all the pieces on the grid. Tactically similar to Cathedral in that getting your bigger shapes on first helps (in Blokus you are rewarded for placing the single square piece last), but it appears the overall strategy is to aim for the centre so that you won't be squeezed in your corner. So if all players use the same attitude, the games will spatially feel the same (though not necessarily the same visually); there is no randomising game mechanic to increase replay value, only the decisions made by the player(s) to make a different experience. Once you are blocked out of the game, I'd imagine it would be painfully slow to hang around for the next game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This game works wonderfully for 4 players.  Doesn't scale down to fewer players nearly as well, although you can rig up the board to be a "Blokus Duo" board.  The wife hates this one, and the box doesn't fit on my shelf, so this doesn't see much playtime anymore.

A pure abstract tactical game. This is in a class of games that require good visual and visualization abilities to do well at. Also requires a little bit of chess-like anticipation of the opponent's moves.
Rumis can be considered a three dimentional version of Blokus, although, fundamentally very different.

RATING: 7.5
This is a really simple game that is sneakily deep. This is a great game to represent our hobby on the mass market. You can think about it as much or as little as you want and still enjoy the game, and either methodically improve your play or just throw out tiles and see what happens. One word of warning: in a 3-player game, the player who sits between the others will tend to have a tougher time winning, and in a 3 or 4 player game it is very possible for one player to sabotage themselves to take another player out of contention (and that will probably accidentally happen a few times even if nobody is holding a grudge). Still, this game works for basically any skill level or gamer type, with the exception of those who hate abstracts.

Have only played this as two-player. Surprisingly light abstract strategy game; seems more tactical than strategic. Does not feel like "Go with polynominos" or a territorial game. This is a game about expanding, and stopping your opponents from doing so. Bonus points for high quality game components that "snap" onto the recessed board.

Update: Dropped this down from a 7 to a 5. The strategies are somewhat more straightforward than I expected. Your fate is largely dependent on other players. End game is anti-climactic: your choices are very limited and there is little room for player conflict. Ideal "light" games should be tense throughout the game, even if the tension is superficial.

The game plods mid-game almost like Java: players (in vain) try to consider every single move permutation, despite the fact that moves are quite limited even in the mid-game. Unlike Java, however, decisions in the mid-game are largely tactical and thus time spent in this phase is ultimately wasted.

-Perfect information and equal conditions for everyone. This game does not give or take, if you win/lose you deserved it 100% and I like that.

The downside:

Got at GW for $.99 (missing 1 red tile) - it sure is worth that much!  LOL
I'd guess it might be worth $10 for gameplay.
Nice little tactile tile laying game that allows spatial puzzle exercise for gamers and non-gamers alike.

Game is complete now, due to the generosity of Parts BGGers!  :thumbsup:

Lots of strategy involved, yet moves fairly quickly.  Not sure how it goes with 3 players. If I had to predict a game invented recently that would still be known and played a thousand years from now, I'd have to give Blokus the highest chance. The rules are simple and easily learned, yet mastering the game will apparently take as long as mastering chess.

This reminds me of the insidious nature of Tetris. Simple, basic concept that sounds pretty dry but...I'll play one more game. Man, I KNOW I can do better than four pieces...we'll play again. And again. These sort of puzzle abstracts never really do it for me, but I don't know one person who'd turn down a game, and that's got to be good.

Mmm... There's something about abstract strategies that just do it for me. 

This game gets tight really quickly. You want to quickly spread out but it becomes increasingly difficult because every other player is trying to do the same thing. This game is simple enough for kids to play, and while quite a bit of this game just comes down to which one player gets screwed over by the other three more, it's still great!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The beginning is a bit slow and predictable as people push to the center but it becomes increasingly difficult and thus more interesting as the board fills and your decisions become more critical.
Kids and girlfriend approved.

I wasn't sure this was a game that I would enjoy, but I got it as a gift.  After a few plays with my wife and nephews it turned into a game I really enjoyed.  It was accessible to everyone in our family, from my parents all the way down to my six and nine year old nephews; yet it still requires skill and strategy to try and master.  It's also quick to get to the table, so squeezing in a few games as a busy parent is great.

Such a simple game to learn & teach. All your own pieces must connect at a corner only, not on a full side. Fit pieces around other player colours & try to block them out. The person with fewest segments in remaining pieces, when no-one can place any more, wins!

Not sure I like the rule options for 3 players, Trigon works much better by using the smaller play area; would work just the same with this version.

A quick and interesting abstract.  This is a fairly fun game that has a lot of replay value.  This was enjoyable with three, and four might be a bit more competitive.  A great filler without being painfully light.  I'm a bit concerned that going first may be a serious advantage.

Blokus is an abstract strategy game with transparent, tetris-shaped, colored pieces that players are trying to play onto the board. The only caveat to placing a piece is that it may not lie adjacent to your other pieces, but instead must be placed touching at least one corner of your pieces already on the board.

Kids to adults will be challenged and love to play this!  Nearly perfect game except there is little one can do at times to prevent themselves from being blocked off!  Highly Recommended!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Great spatial game - and the fact that it's so accessible to the Tetris generation is another big plus.  My rating is for a four player game only, however.  The game loses quite a bit when playing with three (have to add a dummy player) and two (playing two colors) - with three I'd play something else.  2, get Travel Blokus.  Still, a fun game.

Regras muito simples num jogo bastante complexo de raciocinio, que a todos engana por ser muito mais do que a primeira impressao faz supor.

Simple blocking game. Players begin with a variety of different shapes which they take turns placing on the board (making a diagonal connection with previously placed pieces). The player who succeeds in getting rid of the most pieces wins. 
Clearly challenign but I'm not sure there is a huge amount of depth and seating order is hugely important in a four player game as weak players will open opportunities on their flanks.

Easy to teach. Quick, but not necessarily easy, to play.

Most games I enjoy are computational exercises in disguise. "If he does A, then I should do B" etc. In this regard, Blokus does not differ, but it does require an additional skill: spatial reasoning. Having to mentally rotate and flip objects is a slightly different beast than reasoning through the different branches of a decision tree.

I find it really frustrating when there's a game like Tetris (something only my robot wife can beat me at) that I consistently lose at.  For this reason it should be forewarned to Blokus players that good spatial recognition won't necessarily save you any more than a short branch near quicksand.

Good game.  My wife really enjoys this game.  We play a total of 3 games with the best total score winning. Better with 4 players as the 2 and 3 rules are a little goofy.  Easy for newbies to learn too. For 2 players the travel Blokus is better.

--Sept2004-- Really nice abstract.  Pretty fast; good for 4.  I'd still like to see it with fewer players.

Great game for kids, and keeps adults happy too.  No pesky rules to get in your way.  Simple, competitive.  Fair warning -- if someone is better at it than you, you'll likely get crushed.  Be prepared to learn from your mistakes.

We really enjoyed our first few plays of this when we first bought it many years ago as we had really never played anything like it before.  However, since then, my older sons have refused to play it and my parents tried it and disliked it. My 7-year-old, who happily sat through a 2-hour Prophecy game, got up and walked away from this after about 15 minutes, making it one of only two games he has ever walked away from. Lots of better abstracts out there.

Really only works as a four player game.  I would rate it a 6 as a two player game and 5 as a one player game.

I bought this game and Rumis at the same time, and while I think Rumis appeals to my more 3d appetite, I think I prefer Blokus more overall. I generally don't like abstracts, but this really grabbed me. Besides, my kids (8, 6, and 4) picked up the concept VERY quickly and I realized that it wouldn't take long for them to provide a challenge for me as opponents. They grasped the strategy and understand what they need to do to block me from my best moves.

Winner tends to be the one picked on the least. It plays quickly. It's just so dry and meaningless that I object to wasting precious gaming time racing to block my neighbours off. Maybe if there was a theme attached, but there's not. There are cheap plastic bits and that flawed gaming mechanic of hoping you get picked on the least. Dry and when I play I just don't care.

RATING: 8
Nice, logical game. Each player attempts to place all of their uniquely shaped pieces into a grid with two caveats: the corner of the piece must be diagonal to a piece you previously placed, and none of your pieces' sides may touch each other. Each piece is composed of one or more squares. The game ends when someone runs out of pieces or everyone passes from lack of moves. Going out first gives you 15 points plus 5 points if the last piece you placed is the 1x1 piece. Otherwise you lose one point for each square in all your unplayed pieces. This leads to some interesting strategy, you can save your big pieces to block your opponents' corners, but if you hold them too long you won't have a place to put them and you'll get stuck with the points. Smaller pieces are easier to place, and can help you break through your opposing player's gaps and fill up "their" territory. Very good for an abstract. Pretty good production values. Game plays pretty quickly too, unless you have an overanalyzer in the group.

Excellent spatial abstract strategy game which deserves all the awards it's gotten. Since pieces of the same color may only touch at corners, there are all sorts of possibilities for invading territory where pieces touch. Components are very nice. My only complaint is that it doesn't play well with 2 or 3 (see Blokus Trigon and Travel Blokus).

Area control (sort of) meets tetris.

I've played this online before, but I've still got to make up my mind about playing this in reality. Reason for getting this for workshop with teenagers was that it's attractive looking, simple to explain and it plays fast. With all this experience one would thought I'd be more likely to win and it's not really the case which is a plus - multiplayer chaos plays a large role. I've not yet experienced players gaining up on somebody though it is possible -  not sure if the nature of the game makes people play in silence or it's that no real cooperation is viable in the long run.

Fun and quick (though can be vicious) spatial tile placement game. Players have a set of tetris-shaped plastic tiles. Each turn, they have to place a tile legally. One the corners of their tiles can touch. The game ends when all players have placed their tiles or run out of legal spaces for placement. The players then counts how many squares on their tiles are left. Player with the lowest squares wins.

The game is quite nasty sometimes as one or two players can be ganged up against leaving someone free to dump their large pieces in a poket of space they may have created. The ideas of to make sure you don't get completely blocked off and slowly sneak your pieces behind your opponents. Now, the game is IMBALANCED with three as two players generally get into conflict leaving the last player to romp to victory. Blokus Trigon is probably the better game in the series (2 player aside).

RATING: 5
Great for 2 or 4 players. Things get a little funky with 3. Why? Well, if you play by "the rules", then there is always a ghost player, whose turn is taken by the living players in turns. Because of starting positions and player order, a perfectly balanced game fails to result. This is irritating in an abstract. So, we often play without the ghost player. But even then, there is an unbalancing because two players will have an unprotected flank. I should add that we primarily play this variant with a child.

Blokus is a pretty good abstract if you enjoy lighter abstracts. It has lost a lot for me over time, however. I find that if I'm remotely in the mood to play, I'd rather play Rumis instead - also a light, reminiscent-of-Tetris abstract, but a better one.

CHILDREN'S RATING: 8. I've described our 3 player variant for playing with a child above. I think most 4 year olds will be able to grasp the rules of this game and have fun placing pieces. Some will begin to grasp the tactical relevance of tile placement. The pieces are also very pretty - appealing to kids as well as adults.

It's okay...  It is simple and easy to learn and play.  Great game for more casual players and maybe as a filler.  The 2-player option is underwhelming though and the 3-player variant is even worse.  Basically you want 4-players to play this.

Great idea and fun to play. Unfortunately I can't progress further in the "campaign mode" because I've hit a challenge with a 20 second time limit. It takes me at least 10 seconds to orientate the piece the way I want it, and the 10 remaining seconds isn't enough to assess the board and make a sensible choice. It's no fun if you're not allowed to think!

I'd like a physical copy of this, but I'm not sure if anyone would play with me - might be a bit too abstract.

A simple abstract tile laying game. Sanctioned by the bods at Mensa and you can see why. This game is so simple kids can play and yet elegant and intricate in its own way too. I have a feeling this will shoot to the top of my hot 10.
After a few more games I re-rated this as my first 10 ever. Love it.

I've played Blokus several times, and I find that it is a great abstract 4-player game.  Though the game could be a brain-burner for some, I find that the game plays fairly lightly.  This is a rare game that works best with 4, and that I would not even consider with any other number of players.  In my dozen+ games, I have seen two players dispose of all of their pieces, and get the 20 point bonus for laying the 1-block piece as their last piece.

RATING: 7
Surprisingly fun abstract.  Players each have identical sets of unique pieces.  One piece is placed per turn.  You must place your pieces such that they are touching your own color [i]diagonally[/i], so you are creating holes between your pieces.  You can, however, place a piece that is touching an opponent's color orthogonally, so you fill in the holes in their region.  The winner is the person who has placed the most pieces, so the primary strategy is a combination of maintaining access to as many regions of the board while trying to block off empty regions into which you can expand.  

You may need a timer against some opponents.

Blokus is unassuming. An abstract tile-laying game shouldn't be as much fun as this. But it's attractive, intuitive, and (most importantly) fast-paced. At times it's downright mean.

I like Blokus, but don't love it -- I find the board gets too busy too quickly and can be a strain on my eyes.  It's an interesting application of the spatial abstract, and bears many similarities to GO, but I feel it falls short of GO without being much simpler (indeed, it's perhaps more complicated than that minimalist masterpiece).  I HATE the plastic board.  Production value is just garbage.  A pity on that front.

I love this game. It's a thinker, so don't bring it out if you want a lot of conversation to happen while playing. At least, with the people I play with, we're all so focused on what we're going to do, that we don't have much brain power left to hold a conversation.

This is a good game. Very very easy to start but can get super complicated once you develop your own strategies. I would compare it with Go although it has much lighter strategy involved. It's quick as well, so you can finish a game within 20 mins. The only drawback I can think of is you have to get exactly 4 players. Yes I know there are variants which lets 2 to 3 players can make the game starts. But it's much less fun than the 4-player game. But overall, it's a game that you want to have a try.

Copycat purchase.  played numerous times, many solo challenges, prior to joining BGG.  around the 14th solo challenge, had a "win". 
this was another gateway game for us.  our friends had it and we thought, wow, another cool game.   the luster wore off fairly quickly though as we found we weren't ready for the blocking nature of the game and how frustrating it was to be cornered.  we'd probably be fine with that aspect now, but we have many more games that capture our imagination.  kids will break this out to play with pieces and make designs on the board.  but for actual play, its been relagated to solo challenges and really hasn't been touched in ages.  should probably donate it the kid's school for after school activities.

Very nice abstract, that unfortunately only plays well with four. With two, it's to much a hassle of keeping track which colour you're playing with again. With three, the game is very asymmetric, with one player getting screwed.
After a while, the game started to feel more and more a puzzle than a game per se, which prompted me to adjust my rating downwards. Still fun to play, but I'd rather play Ingeneous with 4 (or any Gipf-game with 2)

As far as abstract strategy games go, this one definitely meets half the criteria: it is abstract.  The problem is, you can't really form much of a strategy since, after the first several pieces are laid, you are basically just reacting to what the previous 3 players have played before you.  And compounding the problem  is the fact that playing with less than 4 players is not an ideal option with the basic game.  But where it does shine is in its simplicity (it can be learned in less than 2 minutes), its fast play, and the fact that, despite its faults, it is still addictive!  When all things are considered, it make for a fairly decent filler game.  Game design: 3/5  Personal enjoyment: 2.5/5  Total: 5.5/10

Update: tried it with 4 and didn't care for it.  Downgrading it from a 7 to a 6.

[Sekkoia 2000 edition] {Abstract; boundary; optimal 4p} Blokus is a nice family abstract game. It's not very deep and is not as conceptual as Chess or Go. Players can easily visualize the board and accordingly decide their moves. It is fast-paced and has quite good player interaction. It accelerates because players have fewer and fewer choices as the game progresses. It has great replay value, too. 

Blokus is not scalable - great for 4, good for 2, mediocre for 3. The scoring system is somewhat artificial but is appropriate to encourage players playing all their pieces.

Blokus is nicely produced. The board is sturdy and holds the blocks quite firmly. The blocks are colorful with nice color tone. I can only complain it's too large to store.

This is an excellent game from first-time designer.  Keep up the good work! 

[Update] I tried Blokus Trigon as well. The rule is essentially the same but it's a better edition of Blokus: more weird shaped bits, more compact size and scale better.

Is this a perfect game?  At four players it is.  Easy to teach and pick up.  Non-gamers usually enjoy it.  Beautiful pieces make it almost a work of art by the time you finish.  Thoughtful, fun, and endlessly replayable.  This is one of the gifts I love to give to friends to gateway them into gaming.

One of my favourite games! Not much a fan of abstract games (although I play them more often lately) I was attracted to Blokus immediately because of the nice pieces. The game is different every time and requires another strategy every time. Demonstrated this game for Hodin at Spellenspektakel and it was well received there as well!

Good game.  Very family friendly as well.  Any game that takes 1 minute to learn is nice to have in your collection for when you don't feel like explaining any rules, but this is a very solid and fun game as well.

Holding it back from a really high rating is that I don't find the 3 player game to be very good, and for some reason the need for this sort of game (quick, simple but certainly some strategy) seems to come up most often when I have three players.

My opinions on this game have steadily inclined.  I have really grown to love this as a two-player and four-player.  Constantly changing game reminds me of my favorite video game....Tetris.

Wow, what a brilliant little abstract! The rules can be explained with three short sentences. It plays very quick (10-15 minutes), has interesting choices (but not enough to create Analysis Paralysis problems), is peculiarly fun and looks pretty. The inital rush for the center, trying to keep others out of your homeland, blocking and reaching - it's all good. This one really brought a smile to my face. Haven't tried with less than four. It seems awkward with three, and I have plenty of good two player games.

Blokus is very pretty - it's the kind of game that one could leave out on a coffee table and people will ask "What is that?"  Games like that are good for getting guests to try a game.  It's also a lot of fun.  The downside is that it's fun only under certain conditions - that is, when you have four players.  The game is unhappy with three (the "people rotate placing the fourth color" rule is blah), and for two players, the superior Blokus Duo (Travel Blokus) is available.  This depresses my rating downward, as games that have specific requirements are harder to get to the table.

Update - I have not changed my rating, as I believe that the requirement for four players really does kill Blokus - on a given week, as few as three, or as many as six, people might be at our game group.  But the times when there have been four, Blokus has always been a hit.

14 FEB 2009 - I love the pieces and the look of this game...shiny and almost luminous. The kids initially were saying "this game is EASY". Then, as the game progressed and everything tightened up they said "this game is HARD". You definitely have to plan ahead and it has a fun puzzle-like feel. It's not a tremendous brain-burner, but if you want to be successful, you have to have both a bit of strategy and a bit of tactical play. I want to play this game more.

Blokus combines spatial reasoning with territory control and blocking. The key to a truly successful strategy, however, lies in your ability to invade the territory of others. I may prefer this with two players. Four is my second choice only because it is possible for two or three players to gang up on the odd man out.

Great game that takes almost no set-up time. It's basically open the box and play which adds to the value of the game. 

The strategy element is very present and the game's simplicity is its greatest attribute. The game's main issue is that innate spatial ability determines the winner (or competitiveness of the game) long before the game begins. 

That said, it is a great way to increase your spatial ability by playing against others or solitaire.

RATING: 7.5
I've played over 100 four-player games against AI opponents in the excellent and free computer versions called Freebloks 3D and especially Pentobi.

The rules make it easy for anyone to learn how to play the game in minutes. After that, it's a matter of taste.

While I love 4-player games for sheer fun, I prefer the "Duo"/"To Go!" 2-player version, which is more cut-throat.

RATING: 8
Blokus is on of my 'Only 5' games (one of the 5 games I would pick if I could only play 5 games for the rest of my life, this assumes optimal playmates are always available).
It is an 'Only 5' because of its incredible replay-ability and depth as 2-player game. Both in duo mode and even more so at the regular 2-player mode. There is excellent offense defense balance. Very quickly boards will diverge and become completely new challenges. 
It also scratches my spacial reasoning itch like a motorized wire brush. 
This all said, it is not the most exciting, or even fun game. I've had far more moments of sheer fun playing Love Letter than ever playing Blokus. But if I played Love Letter 1000 times, would I get bored? Yes. Not sure with Blokus. 
Final note: Blokus' biggest flaw may be its name. I fault no one for passing on this game because of its name alone.

I don't know why, but I just don't seem to like this as much as most.  Certainly part of it is that it is an abstract, which tend not to excite me, but there are other abstracts that I enjoy (including Rumis/Blokus 3D).

Nothing wrong with the game, I just don't have fun when I play it.

RATING: 6.75
Very neat little game that's an excellent intro into gaming (for my 7 year old daughter, anyway!). 

It's another one where you have to learn the skills of diplomacy, co-operation, strategy and planning in the same way that crap like Monopoly doesn't. Certainly a sharp eye and the ability to think ahead are skills that won't be wasted on an 8 year old child - and before you point out the 7/8 thing, she was 7 when she first played and now she's 8. 

For another good game for a new/young gamer, see also Incan Gold.

There aren't a lot of games that are interesting and challenging for adults, and still have rules that can be grasped by a five-year-old. Since finding the Geek, I've seen lists of other games that might qualify, but Blokus fits the niche perfectly.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Excellent game for 2 or 4 players. With 2 players I cut the board down to 15x15 and each player plays with only one color. Great game of playing for position while simultaneously cutting off your opponents. This is a classroom favorite- my students actually line up to play it. A bit cutthroat for some.

This is such a great introductory game. My son was able to pick it up at an early age and be competitive. He likes to block other players instead of concentrating on getting his pieces out. It's only knock is it's not the most challenging game, but it's great for what it is.

I don't care much for most abstract games, this one is no exception. The strategy for this game is obvious to me and I can win at it regularly against other adults which is also what makes it utterly boring. My wife and daughter both enjoy the game and play it fairly often.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
We have a lot of fun with this one as a family.  It almost inevitably includes a conversation something like: "You blocked me" followed by "That's why it's called 'Block-us'".

The only downside we have as a family is that we have 5 players and this only supports 4 so someone is always left out.

This is an abstract strategy game. It has a nice interesting play and has some stress level waiting to see if other people will block your move. It is one that you can pull out with people who don't game, but people who are used to playing games and strategy games are going to have an advantage.

So, it has to get a good ranking if my mom likes it, right?

This is an excellent abstract game (although not as good as Ingenious) that works great for 2-4 players (although Travel Blokus is a better 2-player game).  This game really grows on you with repeated plays.  I started out not liking it very much, but as I played more, I gained a better understanding of each unique piece.  Even though the rules can be learned in under a minute, the strategy takes many plays to begin to understand.  Finally, the pieces and board of the game are gorgeous.

This was an instant love affair for me. Oh, how I love this game.

And blast my family for not loving it the way I do!

I harrassed friends to join the blokus server so we could play online. It's not the same.

Oh, and if the age question comes up, Max wins whenever two ultra-competitive adults are playing, too -- funny how we tend to let his dominance go unnoticed until it's too late. But, as I said, I can't get anyone to play very often.

I think I might actually be willing to play a game of Monopoly with Max if he agreed to play 3 games of Blokus in return. Okay, maybe even just two games.

Fun abstract game with extremely simple rules and nice look. My biggest problem with this game is that it really only works well with exactly four people. Other problem is that after multiple plays it gets a bit dry and at least our group tends to use the same 5-7 piece opening every game.. It is also possible and quite common that one person gets crushed by multiple people.

Space filling is a favorite theme for me, and the original Blokus, which uses square based pieces, is still one of the best.  I'll always play Blokus or Giant Blokus if it is offered. Getting the most pieces played out on an ever shrinking surface is the goal. (see Gemblo.)

Same as Blokus only bigger. When it first came out I commented that the price wasn't worth it.  Actually, I really like the big pieces (they fit my hands) and the huge board.  I'm so glad I got one.  I don't see any reason to play on the small board now. (see Gemblo.)

I'm really disappointed to discover one of the red pieces has warped out of playable usage (bummer.)

Ein nettes kleines Spiel für zwischendurch dass so ca. 30 Minuten dauert und mit nahezu allen Spieler- und Altersgruppen spielbar ist. Zwar hat es wenig Tiefgang, aber es macht Spass und ist wirklich als Familienspiel zu betrachten. Jedoch ist ein großer Nachteil dass es nur zu Viert wirklich richtig gut ist, zu zweit macht es ncoh Spass, aber zu dritt wirklich wenig sinnig.

I don't seem to find Blokus attractive like everyone else seems to.  I think it looks cheap and ugly.  Gemblo, on the other hand looks very nice.  I have also lost badly every time I've tried it, but I'd like to think I'm not holding that against it.  I wonder if I have some kind of sub-conscious prejudice against this game?  Maybe the grey board looks too much like the grey background color that is so prevalent in the computer programs I stare at all day?  If that's true, then the game's visual relationship with Tetris isn't helping...

Blokus is probably the easiest game to teach I've ever played, and it's really fun to boot!

Rules:
1. First piece has to touch a corner.
2. Subsequent pieces must touch at least one of your other pieces' corners, but may not touch any sides.
3. Once nobody can place any more pieces, count the number of squares you have left. Lowest number wins.

That's it! So easy, and it has a tetris-like puzzle feel.

I enjoy Blokus tremendously, but it is strictly a four-player game. Travel Blokus works well for 2 players, but I prefer 4-player Blokus. Although Blokus requires 4 players, it is an excellent game, and one that anyone can play. It doesn't hurt that this is the sort of game that I excel at.

Gave it to my 5 yo son for his birthday.  He likes the colorful pieces and before I was able to explain the rules he was having fun with his sister just trying to place alll the pieces on the board, like a puzzle. I think this was a great purchase.  Extremely simple rules but very thoughtful play.  The downside: lots of little pieces to potentially lose.

Blokus is fun, but really requires 4 people to play.  I *really* like Travel Blokus as it requires only 2 to play.

If you've never played, this game is kindof like Tetris meets Tic-Tac-Toe meets the Snake/Tron light-cycle game.  You play your pieces kitty-corner to previous pieces, where you are not allowed to have the edges of your pieces touch.  At the beginning placement is easy, but as you and your opponents slowly fill in the board, it becomes more and more difficult to play.  Fitting small pieces is a snap.  Fitting larger pieces is a challenge.

I've reached a point where I play 4-person merely for social purposes. The real competition is 2 players with each using double colors.

Otherwise, at a simple level of play it's pretty, it's quick, and there is a delightful feeling when you can sneak through another player's attempts to wall you in.

An immediate hit with almost all new-comers (gamers or otherwise).

RATING: 7
What a fun, pretty, abstract board game with cute stained-glass colored tetris pieces. I love the mechanic, of how your pieces can only tough on the corner, and how it makes trying to claim more territory very challenging, leading to fun patters. A wonderful four-player game. That said, once the hex-board-chaped Blokus Trigon came out, I played that a lot more, and now play the Trigon version 90% and this version 10%, so if you only are going to buy one, buy Blokus Trigon, and then if you are passionate about it, you'll want this one as well for variety.

If you happen to love abstract strategy, it's hard to find a new game better than Blokus.  I'd give this a higher score if the game didn't lie to me on the box...2 or 3 player games STINK.  I hear Trigon fixes that, but I'll wait to see for myself on someone else's board.  With 4 equal players, though, Blokus' endgame feels like an absolute deathmatch!

Interesting game.  Very tetrus like.  Each players starts out with 22 tiles of differing size and shape.  Each player plays a shape in order. Shapes must touch at the corners of anothe piece of your color and can not touch an edge of another piece of your color.  In a 3 player game the players take turn placing the tiles for the 4th color.  Games ends when no one can place any more tiles.  If you use all your tiles you get 15 points and a 5 point bonus for using the 1 square tile as your last tile.  If you didn't use all you tiles, you get -1 pt for each square on each tile you didn't place.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Nice game, but seems to lack the strategic depth of many other abstracts.  To my large surprise, it was an even nicer game with four players than with two - usually, abstracts (in my opinion) does not work well with more than two.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Wonderful bits and simple to teach, and an easy way to play a multiplayer abstract with non-gamers.  Surprisingly difficult to exert full control over an area.  The moment you think you've got something locked down, suddenly somebody cuts into it and it's up for grabs again.  When you're getting squeezed, it's a great feeling to successfully make the break into your opponent's territory.  That said, I can't in all honestly rate it all that highly, because I don't particularly care for abstracts, and I find that this one can get bogged down in analysis paralysis for some players, including me.

2, vagy 4 játékos egy négyzet alakú pályán rakosgat tetris-ből visszamaradt alakú műanyagdarabkákat! Amellett, hogy elég színes látvány, agytornának sem utolsó: mindenkinek ugyanannyi és ugyanolyan alakú darabkája van, mindenki egy sarokból indul. A darabkáinkat úgy kell lerakni, hogy egy sajátunkhoz sarkával illeszkedjen, de oldalával nem! Vagyis úgy kell terjeszkedni, területet foglalni a többi játékos elől, illetve bekeríteni őket, hogy nekünk mindig legyen menekülő utunk - azonban a könnyel lerakható, kisebb darabkák hamar elfogynak!

Aki minden darabkáját lerakja nyer... de valószínűbb, hogy a legkevesebb maradékkal rendelkező lesz a győztes!

I bought Blokus Trigon instead because of its ability to play with 3, but I'll mention that the few times I played this I found myself quite challenged. Enthusiasts seem to have an uncanny grasp on the subtleties of the spatial aspects of the game, and I can see how this is appealing. Sadly, I haven't really invested the repeated plays that would be required for this to become something I'm enthusiastic about.

RATING: 6.1
A quick little abstract game where you compete against one or three other players to see who can lay down the most tiles.

An average two player game will probably only run you 10 or so minutes.

Not a bad choice to pull out and play while watching TV or something.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
For an abstract game, this one's a lot of fun.  It leaves you with the "Just one more game!" feeling, and an almost immediate "Argh!" feeling after each move, as you suddenly see the better piece to play.  Nice tension, nice challenge, and light enough to get non-gamers interested.  I prefer it as a 2-player game than as a 4-player game.

1 play: 4 players
7 plays: 2 players

How it works:each person grabs a bunch of tetris-like pieces in the smae color. Starting in a corner, each player places a piece on the board with one rule in mind: pieces of your own color can only connect to a corner of a previous placed piece. The goal is to get rid of all your pieces.
I rate it that high if it's played with 4 players, not 3.
The plastic pieces and the board are fine, but the game overall is expensive. My advice: go get it!

Blokus is an abstract strategy game with transparent, Tetris-shaped, colored pieces that players are trying to play onto the board. The only caveat to placing a piece is that it may not lie adjacent to your other pieces, but instead must be placed touching at least one corner of your pieces already on the board.
\13\ \13\ 
The game is played on a square board divided into 20 rows and 20 columns, for a total of 400 squares. There are a total of 84 game tiles, organized into 21 shapes in each of four colors: blue, yellow, red, and green. The 21 shapes are based on free polyominoes of from one to five squares (one monomino, one domino, two trominoes/triominoes, five tetrominoes, and 12 pentominoes).
\13\ \13\ 
When a game ends, the score is based on the number of squares in each player's unplayed pieces; a player loses one point for each square (e.g. a tetromino is worth -4 points). If a player played all of his or her pieces, he or she gets a bonus score of +20 points if the last piece played was a monomino, +15 points otherwise

I'd read raves about this on here, but I was skeptical. My generally non-gaming in-laws raved about it; still, I was skeptical. I admit to pre-judging this because it said "Mattel" on the box, and I'm very sorry. I wish all mass market games were this much fun. Plays very quickly, can be explained in one sentence, yet offers a ton of interesting decisions, a great metagame, and a tense-in-a-good-way experience. Just plain fun.

Simple to learn, still with the possibility for mental battles with other players. You really need [i]exactly[/i] four players to get the most out of the game. You can get away with two players if you use a smaller subset of the board (with one of the spare colors used to create a border), but in a three player game whoever is stuck in the middle will be at a distinct disadvantage.

Fun game. It's never the same game each time you play. We adjusted the size of the board for 2 player playing one color each. I think I could always enjoy playing this game.

Played several times face-to-face (mainly with 4 players), as well as few online games against the (decent) AI. A very pleasant abstract game, which works quite well with 4 players (I do not like the rule for 3, and would rather play other games with 2 - but I like it with 4). The components are simple, just like the rules, and yet the game proves an interesting challenge for an occasional play.

Just like Tetris, except completely different.  Fun abstract game; ideal with four players, and okay with two.  Don't bother with three.

Rating downgraded just slightly because it's been so long since it last hit the table.  This has kind of become one of those "forgotten" games on the shelf.  It's very good, but it'll never be the first choice for a four-player game.

LOVE this game. Played with 4 players and it was amazingly simple yet difficult. I bought to play with my gf as a 2 player game, but it is MUCH harder to manage 2 colors at once. Much prefer playing with 4 players and only 1 color.

RATING: 7.5
Easily my favourite puzzle game. Challenging, cut-throat, very competitive until the last move for equally skilled players.

The only downside for me is that, very much like in "similar" games as chess, is that a game between experienced and non-experienced Blokus players isn't exciting at all. Two, or four players really need the same skillset. Opening moves are very important.

As others stated, playing with 3 players is not recommended.

Very accessible for non-gamers. I like Gemblo better. It scales much better with 2-6. I also think play is a little more interesting in the end-game. I have trouble finding as many nitches towards the end in Blokus because of the differing placement restrictions between the two games. My family likes this game. It is colorful and fun. I bring this version gaming with me less than I use to. Now I usually bring Gemblo and the two player Blokus, because of it's size.

Great family game. Super easy to explain to non-gamers: at one point in my life, I was teaching English in Korea and ended up dating a Korean woman who spoke no English, while my Korean was quite poor... but I was able to teach her to play in 10 minutes without a problem. I think I could have done it with no Korean at all, just demonstrating with the pieces and a few hand gestures.

Despite the simplicity of the rules, it's got a fair bit of strategy... and while the usual problem of zero-chance, perfect-information games for more than two players is that they come down to politics and kingmaking, that isn't much of an issue here because of the limited way players interact. It might be more of an issue for very experienced players, I suppose.

Blokus is a wonderful 4-player game, just great! The 3-player game is lame due to everyone taking turns playing the "fourth player," and having to play two colors in the 2-player game makes that a bit of a mess. My 8-year old daughter loves this game, and has been playing it since she was 7. Regardless, the 4-player game is awesome and makes it a must-have game in everyone's collection.

Having played Trigon first, I've found Blokus to be a lot more cutthroat and possibly much harder.  The placement of pieces require more look ahead/planning because it's easier to be cut off.  Unlike the triangular shapes in Trigon the squarish ones seem to have less vertices to work with and you can often end up with dead pieces that you can no longer extend with due to all the straight edges.  It is a great game, but with how harsh it is, I probably prefer Trigon a bit more.

>>> Rating Comments >>>

A lightweight spacial puzzle, Blokus is a good casual game to break out for unwinding or for a less intense set of players.

Players take turns placing game pieces which are varying arrangements of 1-5 connected squares onto the communal game board. Each player starts in a different corner, a player's pieces can only touch on a corner, and no game piece can overlap.

It's not an extensively complex game, but something could be said for its simplicity being deceiving!

4/9/07 - I originally liked blokus, then I really didn't like it.  Now I love it.  I didn't learn to love it until I became familiar with the pieces and could imagine where they might fit.  The game began to seem a whole lot less arbitrary.  The choices of how to place a piece to further your own expansionistic goals, how to block your opponents, how to find areas you can momentarily put on hold and invisioning the placement of your remaining pieces are all titillating to extremes.  Regardless of whether you agree, Blokus is a classic that has captured the mind of many-a-gamer and non-gamer alike, and if you don't like it then you deserve a knuckle sandwich.

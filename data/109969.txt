A strange beast - an unofficial reworking of existing classic Ricochet Robots, with a selection of seemingly deliberate minor rules changes (just enough to justify this new edition?) which ultimately are too limiting and frustrating. The game is mis-sold as a super-hero game, with gaudy graphics indicating some sort of chaotic beat-em-up (see "Rampage), but in fact its a very slow brain-burner. A bunch of unnecessary components and a bad rulebook add to the confusion. 

HOWEVER (and this is a major point), the original gameplay of Ricochet Robots is still present and correct in Mutant Meeples and that means the game is a great deal of fun. The special powers for the individual pawns (the one truly significant change) add variety to the basic mechanic and work very well. The game is easier than its ancestor and that will appeal to a lot of players, but the rules allow for lots of customisation of difficulty levels. 

Ultimately, you could play the original Ricochet Robots rules with your Mutant Meeples set (with only minor tweaks), so this game basically replaces the older title. This makes me a little uneasy with Ricochet Robots still in print.

Just play ricochet robots instead. Adds too much complexity to what was a great game. Get rid of the special powers and shrink the board. The only good mechanic they added was after scoring a colour you can't use it a gain, what a fantastic catch up mechanism.

A neat variation on Ricochet Robots and, in my opinion, much more enjoyable. The various powers that each meeple has added some fun variety to the game that I felt was missing in Ricochet Robots. Was sad to learn from Ted at Essen 2014 that the chances of an expansion are pretty much non-existent due to the low sales numbers.

Much better than its  predecessor "Ricochet Robot", Mutant Meeple is very well balanced thanks to the fact that the more you solve things, the less mutants you can use. Therefore the stronger players start fast but pretty soon get stuck and the slower players get to catch up which makes everybody like this game.

RATING: 7
I was rather surprised to enjoy this one as I have never enjoyed its predecessor, Ricochet Robots.  However, there are many tweaks that just plain make this a better game!  Here's what I like:
 
1) The handicapping system is ingenious!  The more points you have, the more limited your options are for solving the current puzzle.  While the best puzzle-solvers will still likely win, at least those that aren't as skilled will have a shot at making a few solves.

Without going into too much detail, the handicapping system also creates a cool dynamic where not everyone is solving the exact same puzzle each turn either, which is really neat-o.

2) The planning board is also great!  One of my biggest beefs with Ricochet Robots was having to remember long sequences of moves.  You still have to remember some stuff here if a solve is particularly complex, but the planning board helps a great deal.

3) Each meeple has his own special ability, which adds some fun to the solves and allows for some pretty clever combinations.  It's a bit frustrating to remember which meeple does what at first, but it gets pretty fun once you get the hang of it.

So, if you liked Ricochet Robots, I can't see why you wouldn't like this.  If you didn't like Ricochet Robots, try it anyways; you might find it fixed some issues that were off-putting.  If you've never played Ricochet Robots but like spacial puzzles, give it a shot too!

RATING: 6.5
This game has been a huge hit with my wife – who has actually beaten me in every single one of our games! That’s not weird as she’s very good at Ricochet Robots which is the game Mutant Meeples remind me of. You’re trying to reach a certain spot on the board which is random each time, and you’re trying to move your meeples like in RR – the difference is that these meeples have superpowers! So they can, once per game, move through walls, teleport, jump over obstacles etc.  I really love how each meeple is unique. The other difference in MM compared to RR is that you can only move 3 different meeples each round – this is a rule I wasn’t too fond of as it seemed to limit you unnecessarily; I would have preferred if you just had a maximum number of moves (which you do, and which I’m also not a huge fan of).

The fact that each player loses the ability to move the meeples they have already used to reach the different spots with is a great idea – it is kind of a catch-up mechanism which ensures that the games are probably a little closer than they would otherwise be. The game board is double-sided so you can choose which side you want (we like the harder side with less walls), and that’s a great touch, so kudos to the designer and publisher. There are also some variants, and all in all it plays quite smooth and fast, so it’s definitely a keeper.

This small expansion just includes 2 new meeples, but nonetheless it’s a pretty good expansion (I think it’s included in the base game now). I especially like Swapmeet, whose power is that he can swap place with any other meeple – this can be extremely handy! Nacho Fast is somewhat lame as he can just move once, so it’s not that common that he is used (though I have indeed used him a few times). The two meeples add even more possibilities which is always a plus in my book, so I’m probably going to include them in most of my games.

This is just one of those games that just does not do it for me.  I guess it comes from my inability to see the patterns needed to successfully win the game fast enough (or at all).

Contains a huge improvement over the original Ricochet Robots design in that it helps deal with the runaway leader problem by constraining the leader more and more the farther ahead she gets. But, it lacks the elegance and simplicity of the original design. Some of the solutions are near-impossible.

RATING: 4
An improved version of ricochet robots. Instead of trying to get to the objective with 2/3 robots on the board, you use 'mutant meeple' who have different powers. This makes it easier as the meeples powers make the objectives easier to complete. I still don't consider this a 'game', as it is more of a competitive puzzle. You will either hate it or love it. I am in the former category.

This game is almost great for me - I want to play it again and put in one of the Sidekicks and then I think it would be more fun.

to enjoy this game you have to like puzzles and speed - it's sort of in the Ubongo vein. A target on the board is identified, and players race to figure out how they can get a meeple there in the fewest number of moves.

It can be quite fun, but there were two downsides for me. First, there's a need to remember the movement rules extremely well because then you've got the various meeples which break those rules. Many times I thought I had a solution only to later realize I'd broken a rule. Secondly, I think the blue meeple is woefully under-powered compared to the rest, to the point where it was truly detracting from me enjoying the game. So as I said - next time I want to swap him out and see if it clicks better for me.

At first I thought it was just Robo Rally, and that turned me away.  I don't like the fact that I never get to play that game when I play with people who are good at it.  But Mutant Meeples cleverly builds in some catch-up mechanisms that help ameliorate that problem.  On the con side of the ledger, however, the ending seems to come down to getting lucky, of finding a path with the one guy you have left.  That can easily be not possible, depending on the guy and the location.  And even if it is possible, it can take more moves at minimum than someone else.  Maybe these just aren't my style of game.

I could either rate it very high because (based on only one game experience) it has a great theme and the mechanism and idea really gripped me.

Or I could rate it a 1, because i'm quite positive that I would NEVER win a game (for those who know it: in a 6 player game I still had no meeple in my team when the game was over), because  - although I'm a hard core gamer - I'm obviously too slow witted for this.

So I just took the average grade..........

RATING: 5
I'm not sure Mutant Meeples is an improvement over Ricochet Robots. Game mechanics are identical but each "robot" now has a different kind of special ability. On one hand that makes the puzzles a little less obvious sometimes, and often allows for multiple competing solutions. Since you can no longer use a meeple you have successfully used to solve a case any longer it also serves as a device to make the game more difficult for successful players.

On the other hand, the various super powers seriously distract from the core activity board play. While you will probably no longer need to refer to the cheat sheet for what the powers are after a couple of matches, you still need to keep straight which meeples you already used and must keep your hands off now. I found that rather annoying. In this case, less would be more.

Ricochet Robots with powers.
Gameplay is a bit more limiting to create a catch-up mechanism: First, you may only move a maximum of 3 different meeples to solve, and they must be in sequence (ie: all of red's desired movement, then all of yellow, etc). Second, whichever Meeple reaches the target becomes a point for that player and that player may not move that Meeple for any future rounds! As a result, the player in the lead will have less and less options per future rounds.

The powers are a nice extra. Per Ricochet Robots; 1 move for any Meeple is in a straight line until being stopped by a wall, the edge of the board, or another Meeple. The powers are a once-per-round ability that may be used instead of a regular move.

RATING: 10
This is a ten for us as there's nothing we can think of that we'd improve. It's an absolutely superb game, tremendous fun, a real challenge, competitive without being adversarial, interesting, varied and replayable, colourful and scales most excellently. And yes it is a relationship of Ricochet Robots but MASSIVELY adds to that experience and despite the similar core mechanism is really very much its own game. In fact it might be worth mentioning we're not huge RR fans, but we LOVE this.

Almost passed this up, but went back for the wife who loves puzzle games.  And ya know, this was a damn good game.  It worked the brain and kept everyone involved.  The degenerate solutions were fairly rare and ingenuity often ruled the day.  I haven't actually played Ricochet Robots, but I didn't feel like I needed to.  This wasn't extra fluff on top of a game system; it felt complete and whole on its own.

I'm a little ambivalent about Ricochet Robots, so I was curious to see how I would like this similar game.  At this point I'd have to say that I'm differently ambivalent about this one.  I like the catch-up mechanism built in to losing a meeple when you connect with it, although it can be frustrating in the moment.  I'm not so fond of the way you claim solutions and the fact that you can't improve them once you've put in your claim.  The special powers are kind of a double-edged sword.  They're cool, but they can be hard to remember.  I'm sure a player with lots of experience with the game would have a big advantage over newbies because they don't have to constantly refer back to the player aid.

Initial Rating: 6.5 (July 2014)

I had a high level desire to play Mutant Meeples. I love Ricochet Robots so I thought it would be a blast. After a couple of games I think I was right and now Mutant Meeples has the potential to go up in my personal ratings.  It is ,obviously, very Ricochet Robots derivative, but it offers radically new ways of play so I will (for now) leave both of them in my game collection and treat them as different games in my geeklists. 

It is more complex and harder than RR, but that’s not a bad thing. In MM, you only can move 3 meeples per turn AND only if you haven’t scored that particular meeple. Thanks to this, the game is not very hard and it also works out as a catch up mechanism as it is harder to score each time. Also you improve very quickly. Love the different meeples` powers. The powers are easy to learn after a couple of turns.

Also like the construction/destruction tiles making for a very high replay factor.

On the bad side, the game came with a couple of really hard boards to punch. Many tokens and counters were damaged by this, I’m not sure if I will request replacements. I also noticed that the hard to punch cardboards were of a different color of the rest of the game. 

The planning of the moves seems fiddly and boring as the game is mostly a mental exercise, I will see if we can play without it.

I really like the game and plan to play it again soon, this time with the hard board.

Bastante parecido a Ricochet Robots, pero con algunas diferencias. De hecho, este juego es una mejora del RR.

Aquí tienes 8 super héroes diferentes, cada uno con una habilidad especial. Necesitas resolver seis de los puzzles para ganar la partida, pero cada vez que ganas una ronda, pierdes un meeple.

Es una reimplementación simpática del juego original.

Quite similar to Ricochet Robots, but with a twist. In fact, this game is an upgrade of the RR.

Here you have 8 different superheroes, each one with a special power. You need to solve six of the puzzles to win a game but every time you win a round, you lose a meeple.

Usually adding crazy elements to a core game is not good idea. In this case, it works somewhat.

There is also an element of catch-up but still, the better player will win 99% of the time.

RATING: 6
Mutant Meeples is inspired by Ricochet Robots, one of my absolute favourites. While building from this platform is promising it also raises the bar very high. Too high in that case. While I enjoyed Mutant Meeples, there is nothing that would have me choosing it over Ricochet Robots. The most fun part in RR is figuring out 20+ step moves with repeatedly involved different Robots. In MM, more than half of the puzzles are solvable in less than 5 steps and it often degrades to a mere speed game of grabbing the lowest tile first. Too many meeples and the special functions reduce the number of needed moves too much in many cases. Remembering the special functions of the Meeples as well as which meeples you still have available adds a memory component to the game which further detracts from the fun part. It's still fun but the better is the biggest enemy of the good.

Mutant Meeples is a puzzle game in the vein of Ricochet Robots in which players are looking to find the shortest "path" to get their meeples to the scene of the crime before any of the other players, using a clever combination of Mutant Meeples and their unique superpowers and super speed. If you're the fastest to the scene of the crime, you add a meeple to your super team; the first player to fill his super team with Mutant Meeples wins!

But there's a catch – once one of your meeples has reached the scene of the crime, he no longer participates. (After all, he’s already "made the team".) This gives players who have fewer meeples on their super teams more options, and provides an additional challenge to players whose super team is almost full.

In einem Raster von A-Z x A-Z wird zufällig ein Ziel markiert.
Jeder Spieler muss sich nun im Kopf überlegen, wie er dieses Ziel mit den Meeples auf dem Brett mit den wenigsten Zügen erreichen kann. Dabei hat jeder Meeple nochmals Sonderbewegungsaktionen.
Wer sich eine Zahl nimmt, die der Anzahl der angesagten Schritte entspricht, dreht die Sanduhr rum. Alle anderen Spieler haben jetzt noch 30 Sek. Zeit sich eine kürzere Route zu suchen.
Wer als erster 5 Meeples zum Ziel führt gewinnt das Spiel.
Viel mehr Spaß macht es, mehrere Meeples bewegen zu müssen um sie als Stopper einzusetzen um dann mit einem 2ten oder 3ten erst das Ziel zu erreichen. Leichter ist es allerdings mit einem einzigen um 5 Ecken zu laufen um es zu erreichen.

A really great puzzle game, Mutant Meeples combines a clock and spatial awareness in a way that I really enjoy. I love the variable meeple powers, and I like the inherent catch up mechanism where you can't solve a room with a meeple that you've already solved with. It really adds a layer to the game that isn't present in the other similar game that I can never remember the name of.

I don't know... love Ricochet Robots, but this just seemed to mess with the formula too much.  A very fun idea for sure, but it's just not as "pure".  I do like the catch-up mechanic more so than that in R.R. (your ability actually weakens as you score, rather than just giving priority to lower scoring opponent.)  Other than that, I just think the board where you commit your hero tiles, grabbing the number, the coordinate tiles, etc. all just make it kind of messy.  Maybe I'd really enjoy a variant of R.R. that introduces some of the concepts in M.M. while maintaining most of the sleekness of R.R..  The ideas of unique cool ways to get around and "break" rules is awesome.  The weakening the leader idea is awesome - just don't think that it was executed well enough here to replace the beloved Ricochet Robots.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
I don't see this as an improvement over Ricochet Robot(s).  This adds abilities I don't have much interest in and limitations (in both player count and robot movement) that I don't like.  

The idea that your "team" meeples are unavailable kind of works as a catchup mechanism, but I just found it irritating.  Yeah, I could do that one in 3 as well if I could move the grey guy, but since I just moved him to the last target, I can't do it in less than 10 so I'll just wait here...

If you like Ricochet Robots you may enjoy Mutant Meeples. Mutant Meeples is pretty much the same as Ricochet Robots but the pieces each have a special power of some description.

Sadly, or perhaps not so sadly, I don't particular care for Ricochet Robots and after all of one game I can truthfully say that the same of Mutant Meeples.

Don't get me wrong, I can see the appeal of the exercise, but it just does not even remotely float my boat. For mine, it comes across as more a puzzle than a game (I know there is the competitive aspect to it with players being timed to find a better solution once one player thinks they’ve cracked it) but puzzling out the minimum number of moves to get a meeple from one point to another is just not too much fun.

Will not buy and will actively avoid playing in the future.

If you look in the rules for Mutant Meeples there is a simple statement, similar to an academic attribution, stating that it is a development of an existing idea. That might or might not land you in hot water, but I personally respect the acknowledgement rather than un-cited plagiarism.

I remember playing a lot of Ricochet Robots in college on Friday nights. Mutant Meeples takes everything I loved about that game and adds special powers and a definitive end to gameplay. I like that there are variable rules to handicap more experienced players or add an extra challenge once you've become familiar with the game's mechanics. The random nature of the setup and scene of the crime marker placement as well as the double sided board ensure that this game will have replay value for a long time to come. Not to mention the sidekick expansion that's included in the box but that I haven't played with.

Versione aggiornata e un po' più complicata (inutilmente) di Rasende Roboter/Ricochet Robots. Il gioco ha giusto un paio di spunti innovativi e una tematica di fondo nuova (appiccicata, agetni alla ricerca di un crimine), per il resto viene ripresentato il successo di Alex Randolph. Giustamente, a mio modo di vedere, il gioco non ha riscosso grande successo perché le nuove regole servono solo a rendere la spiegazione più lunga con nuovi poteri degli 'agenti' Meeples da memorizzare e metabolizzare. Niente di veramente nuovo quindi all'orizzonte, gioco da evitare se avete già Ricochet Robots, altrimenti potrebbe essere un'alternativa, tra l'altro attualmente lo si trova a prezzi scontatissimi.

Ricochet Robots Revisited, with special powers for each robot (i.e. jump an obstacle once, or strafe once etc). The underlying game is the same, except the objective is now to "collect the set": be first to successfully complete a puzzle with six out of the eight robots.

I like the bigger, two sided board, and the "easy" side (more obstacles) should make the game newbie-friendly. The super powers are interesting. Annoyingly, the game is far from colourblind friendly - the decision to use meeples as robots means that they have to be distinguished by colour, and I found this extremely difficult. There are stick-on glyphs, but they are tiny and hard to see in all but perfect lighting conditions. Mutant Meeples would be much better for me if it were Revised Robots, with different figures.

But even with that change, MM has the same fundamental problem as RR: it is a matter of timed skill rather than strategy. Players who "get" the game are dominant, and players with less spatial visualisation ability get crushed. Notwithstanding my inability to differentiate the pieces, I found it easy. Other players laboured.

There is a brilliant game here, that desperately needs to be ported to a computer tablet and given a new scoring mechanism. Played against "the crowd", with scores based on comparative time (rather than a race to be first), Mutant Meeples should be fantastic.

RATING: 7
Infuriating-in-a-good-way variant of Ricochet Robots.  

My main complaint versus Ricochet Robot is that in Ricochet Robot it is easy for any number of people to stand around the board and just call out guesses.  In Mutant Meeples, you need to program in your solution and then reach for the corresponding total-moves marker.  There's really no good way to set up the markers in a way that they are equally reachable by all players -- this proves to be a real limitation since the game relies utterly on the speed with which everyone can reach those markers.

Well designed game, but calculating optimal moves spatially is not my forte.  My son really likes this game.  I don't see this as a game I'd play with my gaming group or my wife (she gets more frustrated with spatial puzzle games than I do).

Um jogo do outro-mundo, uma metamorfose como nunca antes vista em qualquer outro jogo, um maior hino a "Ricochet Robots" do que o próprio "Keltis" para com "Exploradores"; não quer isto dizer que seja melhor, na verdade prefiro a pureza da obra de Randolph, mas tenho de reconhecer que este jogo está de se lhe tirar o chapéu, de tão bem imaginado. Parabéns Ted Alspach, estou surpreendido. Merece ser visto, tem mesmo de ser visto!

First play impressions: Surprisingly fun. The various abilities of the meeples are interesting and the timer is important - once someone's come up with a path, everyone else won't get half an hour to try and beat it. Sometimes the shortest path is obvious after someone just puts down the meeples they're going to use and the timer is unnecessary. But I'd hate to be in a game without it with someone declaring a path for their penultimate point with another guy on their heels, wracking their brain for a better solution. The game has a little of the 'programming' feel that Roborally has, but none of the chaos. I'll take the latter any day, but Mutant Meeples is good too.

Quite different from Ricochet Robots, as Mutant Meeples forces you to plan your moves in more detail and any failure to do so is punished.
The different characters' abilities are a bit confusing to my mind, but they are fun and not hard to remember. Actually implementing them under time pressure is hard for me though.

Mutant Meeples is Ricochet Robots Advanced, though it's actually easier and more forgiving than Ricochet Robots. In other words, it's a spatial logic puzzle within a speed game with special powers. Some, I'm sure, would hate it, but I'm good at it and I like it.

RATING: 7
This is, as I understand it, a re-implementation of Ricochet Robots with super powers.  It is a sort of speed/puzzle game where several meeples are arranged on a gridded board along with several "buildings" which are barriers between two spaces.  Each round a random space is designated a target space and each player tries to get to that space in the fewest moves using up to 3 meeples.

When moving each meeple moves in a single orthogonal direction until they hit a building, another meeple, or the edge of the game board.  But each meeple also has a special power they can use once a round.  These are things like pass through a building, move one space in a direction, or wrap around the board.  Also, once you reach a target space, the last used meeple is added to your "super team" and can no longer be used for the rest of the game.  The winner is the first to reach a super team of 6 meeples so the closer you are to winning the fewer options you have.

At first I was afraid this game would be incredibly stressful.  Which it was, but the stress never became overwhelming.  Perhaps it is because I won and I was able to come up with the fastest solution several times and I might feel less enamored if I was getting beat to the punch the whole game.  But the tension combined with the puzzle solving, which I enjoy, really make this a unique and enjoyable experience.  Too many times puzzle-solving games become a kind of multiplayer solitaire but this one manages to make me feel like I am constantly competing with the other players.

There's not much to say about the components.  It's a set of meeples, game board, and cardboard pieces.  But the game is definitely enjoyable and fresh feeling.

RATING: 7
Interesting twist on Ricochet Robots. There are 8+ "mutant meeples", each of which has a special power (move through a wall, move one space diagonally, teleport to certain marked spaces, etc.). Once a player has solved a puzzle with that meeple, they can't use it any more.

It's less elegant than Ricochet Robots and the meeple powers make it frustratingly difficult to calculate -- the variety is interesting but does not, I think, compensate for the additional mental overhead.

What's interesting is that Mutant Meeples goes a long way towards solving the main problem with the original, which is that it is typical for one player to utterly crush the opposition. It's a demoralizing proposition that makes it a tough call to play as a filler. Here, the better players have a harder and harder time as they lock out meeples, which keeps everyone in the game -- and makes it so there is no single optimum solution, because each player will have different meeples available.

While I prefer Ricochet Robots for its genius simplicity, Mutant Meeples is a worthy variation.

Equal parts puzzle and game, Mutant Meeples occupies an interesting niche in my collection. On one hand, I do enjoy it from time to time. On the other hand, because the game feels a bit like mental exercise when I'm down with it, I do not break it out very often. IF you enjoy puzzle-y games, you should definitely check this one out (it could be easily be higher than a "6.5" if this is your style of game). If you are interested in a more puzzle-y game for your collection, MM may fit the bill, but you may want to do some searching before you add this one to your collection.

I'm familiar with Ricochet Robots, but I've never technically played it, though I have done some online puzzles and the like before.

I thought I wouldn't enjoy pure Ricochet Robots, but I would enjoy the mechanic with a game added on to it.

Honestly, I think this game fails to deliver on that.  The catch up mechanic basically turns this from a puzzle that can be solved by anyone into a situation where solutions exist for one person that don't exist for another, and if we're not playing under the same circumstances, the only thing I can do is use other superheroes and more time to get there.

Then I'm just waiting for you to catch up to me so we're on more even terms, but still not completely equal since we're solving different puzzles.

With Ricochet Robots, we're all solving the same puzzle, much more interesting, and totally different game.

Nice version of Ricochet Robots. The special rules of the meeples making the game interesting.

The problem is when you win a round, you can`t use one meeple. After wining few rounds you will have some meeples block and it would really hard, or imposible to find a solution in a next round.

Edit: Nice at start, but than boring

By all accounts including the Designer's, Mutant Meeples was inspired by Richochet Robots.  Despite the fact that virtually everything in the game is different other than the giant map and the sliding robots, the net effect is virtually identical.  The puzzles are numbingly difficult to solve if you're not the spatial sort, and I'm not.  Who knew that sliding robots were so distinctive?

2012-12-24: The escalating difficulty balancing mechanism works really well.  Playing against someone new to the genre, who had but a tentative grasp of how it would play out, victory was only by two meeples, and it was getting close!

Nice mechanics but there is scope for much forward planning and the decisions aren't simple. This, of course, leads to excessive downtime whilst players wallow in the swamp of choices. The colour-mixing chart is crazy-complex and requires checking over and over again. Ultimately it plays slowly as a result and outstays its welcome. Shame as it's a nice production and there are some good ideas here.

A game of Scoville starts strong and moves fast for the first couple of rounds. Then it just freezes over. 

The main problem with Scoville, in my humble opinion, is that the option space grows exponentially through the course of the game (new variety of peppers and more harvesting options). This really adds to the narrative of the game and creates an arc of drama but mechanically players are left with too many choices how to min-max their actions. Add chaos to the mix and it becomes very difficult to plan ahead. You guess in what form the problem shows itself to the players… Yes, a lot of downtime.

I like the theme and the mechanics. I just would have had a more elegant way for the acquisition of peppers.

*Rating based on one play.

Solid game, but doesn't bring anything new to the table.  The different color combinations are kind of interesting, but require frequent use of the color combination chart.  The planting phase could be a source of AP for some players.

Pretty slick new farming/auction/order fulfillment game.  The pepper bits are amazing.  I had to squint several times at the colors of the peppers on the cards, but thankfully, the thicknesses are tied with the color.  The game packed a lot into a very short play time (~45 minutes) and was pretty streamlined.  I like it, but may not buy it.

1st play: Lighter than expected but in a good way. The game is beautifully produced and the theme is strong. I like collecting and growing the sets. The game plays fast and is overall pleasant. 

2nd play: I still enjoyed the game, lots of little tactical moves are possible. It is too heavy for a gateway game, and too light for a gamer's game. Whether I keep it will be decided by how often it's requested.

RATING: 7
Good, fun. This falls pretty heavily into the "abstract game" territory of euro games, but it's a pleasant little abstract game.

My only complaint would be that the end goals seemed a little too straight-forward. The game seemed a bit too long just to be straight-up buying victory points. If it were shorter, though, the garden wouldn't get big enough to be a completely fulfilling experience though.

Due to the lack of theme, I don't know that it really suits itself to an expansion, to make there be something more interesting in addition to garden walking. So I think it could use to be shortened a bit, maybe by pre-seeding the garden with more peppers and starting the players in the corner, so that they are still in competition right at the start despite the pre-seeded slots.

RATING: 7
There is a lot to like in this color (pepper?) combining, essentially dressed up abstract.  The ability to choose turn order is determined by blind bidding which is one of my least favorite mechanics; yet, in this game, I find it close to tolerable.  

One of the more interesting aspects of this game is that going first means you get first choice of the goodies (nice), and placement of colored peppers on the board (nice), but means you go last, or late, in the pepper collection phase (might spell trouble if you are blocked). That ability to strategically place colored peppers and also block players (while also being the first one in turn order to fulfill the finite number of contracts) seems to be the heart and strategic soul of this game.  

I found Scoville to be thematically lacking, though I did like playing with and placing the pepper meeples.  I felt like I was playing a decent abstract where color combinations were front and center.  Decent but not fireworks.   
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Gameplay is great, art is typical TMG fare, and it's got depth.  My main issue is that we kept running out of brown, white, and phantom peppers during play and had to use substitutes.  TMG should have shipped this with more pepper pieces.

Fluid, elegant, colorful, pepper picking and selling fun. You're scoring points by a variety of means, moving farmers through a field to crossbreed peppers based on the choices available. Plenty of strategy available, but it's an intuitive design that is not difficult for beginners to pick up. All this praise, and I can't even stand hot peppers! So you know it's great...

So many enjoyable, interesting, euro choices to be made in a game that is VERY uniquely themed. Just the right amount of brain-burning as you decide which peppers to take in the auction, where to move your farmer to grow what, and using what you grow to sell at market or make chilies for the town competition. All of these choices are weighed the entire game, giving you a lot to manage but in a well designed package. So much thinky fun!

Played with the maximum player count (6), which probably hurts my impression of the game. I like the mechanics, but the board changes so quickly that plans are pretty much foiled between planting and harvesting. I finished second, but feel like I just got lucky. We started running out of peppers in the second round, which hurts the gameplay. You can't plant the sticky notes you are using to keep track of your peppers.

This game is a jackpot. In Scoville You will find brain burning part which is breeding chart. Rules are simple but planning and implementing Your strategy is super super difficult. Why? Because of negative interaction in this game which is everywhere! Auction, planting, blocking, stealing recipies and market needs.. :) If You don't like stuff like this don't buy this game. Some could say that the game is expensive but quality of this game is just awesome. It is one more step further than CGE in my opinion. Theme is very strong - all parts are totally about hot peppers and fictional village of Scoville :) 

*If You feel that auction system is "hurtful" for losing player there is a home rule that was approved by producer: vickrey auction. This means that auction is still blind. Bidders submit amounts of money without knowing the bid of other people in auction. The higgest bidder wins but the price paid is the second-highest bid. Player that lost auction doesn't lose money.

I liked this one alright, but didn't think it was anything too special.

It did have some novel things going on, such as the mechanism for collecting peppers.  The board fills with various peppers throughout the game, and players collect peppers by walking between them.  The two colors of peppers you walk between determines what you get, as the colors all crossbreed, allowing you to get better and better peppers with good breeding.

However, I really disliked how huge turn order was to the game (and I often benefited from choosing well in our game, so I wasn't taking the brunt of it).  Being in the wrong place in turn order can cause gigantic swings in points, which just seemed rather severe.

Overall, the game was functional but unexciting.  I can definitely see how other might like it more than I did, but for me, it's a game I'd play if others really wanted to, but would never choose myself.

*6* (Initial Plays)
The game looks visually appealing even if there are some graphic miscalculations. It's definitely AP prone and is much heavier than it looks. So much to think about and starring at the pepper conversion sheet takes lots of time to process, lots of options. I think the victory point badges for planting peppers seems way too good when filling some recipes gives similar amounts of victory points There is definitely a heavy influence for turn order in this game for choosing first and blocking others. Overall, I think it to be a solid game, not great, but something I would not mind playing.

This game has a ton of AP! Trying to understand the color puzzle just drove me crazy so I'm sure I ended up making a bunch of sub-optimal moves. I feel like I understood the mechanics, but just could never see far enough ahead to get the white/black/ghost peppers easily. I still finished middle of the pack getting a lot of small stuff, but it seems you really need to get the big peppers to score the big points. I love the theme, and both the components and art are wonderful. I'd be interested in playing it with less than 6 to see if it plays a bit faster and I can better find my way through the maze of colors.

Very unique game. The mixing mechanic will remind people of Fresco, but the gameplay is starkly different. Pepper placement is very important, and the method of pick-up brings in all sorts of interesting route-taking and path-blocking strategies. Bidding for turn-order, and turn-order varying by phase (ala Power Grid) is also entertaining.

There's a lot in this game and it's good for families.  Theres a bit of set up required, but it's easy to learn and i think the components are really well made (and extremely satisfying to unpack/pop out of the cardboard sheets) and I really like the artwork.  The kids liked this (13 and 15) even though our first play through was a little long. Adults liked it too. we played with 4, and will try it with 6 next, but I fear that will make it quite a bit longer so an earlier start will be required!

This game is beautiful to look at and play.  The colors jump right off the board, especially as you start planting the multicolored peppers into the brown fields.  This game has a lot of replay-ability.  The cards being auctioned will be different all the time, the recipes to be made will always be different, and the farmer's market will always be different.  These cards are not just different to difference sake, but actually makes to change/adjust your strategies to which peppers to plant/harvest.  This game did hold up to my expectations.

My brother introduced this one to me.  I have only played it twice and liked it much more the second time.  

The good:
Totally, totally unique genre and mechanic.  This is one of those games where the theme and mechanics marry very well.  It grows on you over time.  It trains really well on tactical decisions--short time best decisions based on current variables.  

The bad:
At a certain point, you feel like you want to be able to exert more control.  You work hard to create blends of peppers and other players can bonk you--over multiple rounds.  If you try to go out on your own, you can't be successful either as your farm won't grow fast enough. 

I haven't played the Scoville Labs, but hopefully it will allow for a little more control over your long term plans.

RATING: 8
This turned out to be a surprisingly satisfying game. There is just the right amount of strategy and the four different methods of gaining victory points makes for lots of paths to victory. Because the Farmer's Market and Recipe cards are limited each game and you won't use them all, you'll likely never play the same game twice. Big plus for replayability.

The strategy of turn order bidding, where you plant your peppers, and moving your farmer around the pepper patch to block other players and get the peppers you need is very important and can be under valued at first glance. 

There are only a few problems with it. One not enough of the green, orange, purple, brown, black, and white peppers, which will especially be a problem in 4-6 player games. Probably even the phantoms. I'd say it needs about 10 more of each. Keep your pepper punch outs and paint them for quick extra pepper token. Second one of the pepper patch cutouts is way too small to put pepper tokens in and the pepper tokens aren't consistent in size so some fit very tight in the pepper patch.

This is my goto game when i can't play Power Grid. The table space you need for this game is not to much (we have played a 3 player game of this in the same space that barely held a game of Memoir 44') and its not too long (about an hour to an hour an a half). While I do prefer Power Grid to this, its still amazingly fun and super portable.

Cool unique pepper farming game.  You must weigh long term rewards over instant gratification.  The player with the savviest moves usually wins, but sometimes the board will fall into one persons favor.  Still, a very solid, clean game that holds its own.  Definitely a good one to have and bust out every once in a while.

[size=1]Hoo boy, this was a surprisingly fun game.  A bit on the mathy side, but I was pleasantly taken by its ability to make players play off each other and also quite surprised to note that no matter what we did, the scores were still pretty close.

The components are great as you have pepper meeples of varying size that visually indicate what level they are, but they play well into the theme of being at a hot pepper festival.  It would have been nice for money to be a little more meaningful beyond bidding for a free pepper or two; in a game where the point swing is measured in the teens, a few points for holding onto some coins isn't going to make that much of a difference.  The meat of the game comes from "breeding" wherein you need to plan your farmer's movements to get the peppers you want, but that also ultimately depends on who is planting what pepper where - this can get a little aggressive as players actively dump useless peppers into your farmer's path.

Once you can understand the breeding chart's patterns, play flows pretty well, but it is an unfortunate hitch in the game as those who can't recognize the patterns will need to refer to it every turn.  We found it was very effective to lay out potential peppers in between the planted ones, but it gets a little too cluttered - perhaps some sort of expansion or homebrew kit will do a better job.

At any rate, this game allows for several different strategies and that makes it quite the winner.  So long as you effectively use your actions, you can be nabbing points any which way you want.  We did find that scoring the plates (plaques) to be key to success, but if you can really plan out your path when planting, I'm pretty sure you can mitigate this advantage so long as you don't let one single bozo claim them all.

Great game.[/size]

Right of the bat Scoville offers up some saucy morsels. The bidding for turn position, forward-backward nature of phase resolution, and especially the magnificent breeding chart all distinguish Scoville as unique. The problem is that these mechanics surround an uninteresting to plant specific peppers, and complete contracts/recipes. The lack (true) variability creates a linear arc which lacks the strategic breadth to be enjoyable several times over. Though I find Scoville to be quite fun, there is very little urge to revisit.

Some initial thoughts...we played with 2 players & *still* ran out of peppers. This needs way more components than the ones that shipped with the box.

I also had trouble with some of the pepper colours (especially distinguishing between purple & black) & I'm not colourblind.

Finally, it was way too easy with 2 players to rig the morning/afternoon cycle so as to focus on just selling peppers for money/achieve recipes...then by the time it goes to afternoon, the game is over. Am going to play with some house rules to try & shake that up a bit. Having peppers score might help.

A nice game though. Had been waiting for it for a while & I do love the game...the points above just detract a wee bit (otherwise would have given it an 8).

I enjoyed this one but I am not sure it is worth its current price tag, I mean the components are great, and I do love the way the chilli-meeple stick into the board, but in terms of gameplay its ok.... I guess I was just expecting a little more than I felt the first play of this game offered.

I really like the planting/harvesting mechanic which is reminiscent of [thing=32165][/thing] except in order to generate those sparkly pepper pieces you really need to work together as a team, planting beneficial peppers near to one another.

The crossbreeding chart is simple and functional but it is really a colour mixing chart and so feels quite similar to [thing=91620][/thing], not surprisingly a red and blue pepper 'breed' together will net you a purple pepper. 

The rest of the game play is a general sort of set collection, more peppers are required for the recipes which give you more points than the market which requires less peppers but gives you less points and gives you other peppers/coins etc.

I am not a fan of the blind bid turn order mechanic, but I rarely interacted with it on our play through content to actually end up wherever in the turn order. 
Harvesting with 4 players was tough and we did get in each others way, and I think this would be awful with 6 so I don't think I will ever play with more than 4.

and as a final point it is quite difficult to distinguish between red/purple/black and brown peppers as printed on some of the cards, especially when looking at the cards from across the table.

Valamivel többet vártam a játéktól, mivel nagyon tetszett a paprikakeresztezős (színkeverős) mechanizmus.

Jó lett volna bele még valami csavar, vagy legalább valami más aspektus, mert a két célkártya csoport ízre ugyan olyan.

RATING: 5
The central mechanism of Scoville is the planting and harvesting of peppers on the shared board. While interesting in theory, it's not entirely convincing in practice. The restrictions on farmer movement lead to quite a bit of player-induced chaos, and at the same time the cross-breeding chart and the necessities of recipe fulfillment are quite top-heavy and cause quite a bit of downtime - unless you play purely from the gut which isn't particularly fulfilling, either.

As it is, I'd say the underlying ideas have merit but the execution is a little too cumbersome.

Spielthema frisch, Material erstklassig: dickste Pappe, schön gestaltet. Spieldesigmässig ist SCOVILLE solide US-Handelsware mit handelsüblichen Umtausch-Mechanismus und handelsüblichen Auftragskarten, hier halt als Peperoniarten-Kombinationen(Rezepte genannt). Dabei ist die Kreuzungstabelle für Peperoni-Sorten etwas umständlich im Handling, obwohl total logisch aufgebaut. Auch der Dreischritt auf dem Acker mit dem Erntefigürchen mutet profaner an, als er ist, da man auch die Rundenaufstellung mit 2x wechselnder Spielerreihenfolge innerhalb einer Runde in seine Ernte-Überlegungen mit einbeziehen muss. Und immer wieder muss man auf diese Kack-Excell-Tabelle gucken. SCOVILLE ist eine okay Angelegenheit aus bekanntem Euro-Gemüse und einer im Verhältnis schönen, aber etwas hirnholprigen zentralen Idee, der es etwas an Tabasco fehlt. SCOVILLE kann man durchaus gerne spielen, muss man aber nicht.

RATING: 7
After one play. The game is accessible and intuitive enough that you can break open a new box and sit down with people who have never played it and get a game going. There were times when I felt like the game slowed down too much, particularly with AP going on, but maybe it was because we had eaten and drunk a bunch. 

The boards are slightly warped, so that the farmers walking along edges between boards frequently fell, and even the farmers who weren't walking along the edges were easily knocked over by sleeves of people reaching for their farmers.

The mechanisms felt mostly familiar, except for the crossbreeding, which was fun. The theme is unique enough to draw our interest, yet not too silly as to make it feel like a kid's game (a la Steam Park).

Good game, not sure whether it'll go up or down after repeated plays.

Update: After a second play--good game, would like to play again. Most of the secondary mechanics feel familiar and piled on, but the crossbreeding and harvesting, that's still pretty neat and fun for us.

Update: I agree with these comments from some people who dislike the game:

[q="fizzle"]The restrictions on farmer movement lead to quite a bit of player-induced chaos, and at the same time the cross-breeding chart and the necessities of recipe fulfillment are quite top-heavy and cause quite a bit of downtime - unless you play purely from the gut which isn't particularly fulfilling, either[/q]

Includes possibly my least favorite aspect of game design: another player can completely nullify your efforts beyond all possibility of recovery [i]without even being aware they did it[/i].[/q]

This game is pretty prone to AP, and the space that the board takes up means whoever sits far away from the recipe will have difficulty seeing what combinations are available and how they should plan accordingly. I don't mind taking a long time to play a game--I will suffer through most slogs to get a better idea of the gameplay, familiarize myself with the strategies. But after some plays, I have to say that AP is a frequent trait of this game if you have casual gamers involved, and it is fairly chaotic, so it may not be so fulfilling if one person beats out another without really understanding why or how they did it.

That said, it is colorful and the mechanic does engage the players, so I'll keep looking to give it a shot, though if it doesn't make it to the table more I may just punt.

The production is a mixed bag --nice wooden peppers, like the artwork of Josh Capel, but the rest is so-so. Game is ok. Using the color scheme of primary and secondary colors is a great way to simplify the otherwise unwieldy number of combinations. If you think of peppers as suits in a card deck, you have 10 suits, with 3 primary, 3 secondary, brown, and 2 tertiary in black and white, and an "ultimate" suit in the ghost pepper.  Converting peppers through planting, and the round mechanism of planting, harvesting, and fulfillment works well.  Reminds me of Santiago, but not as good. Overall a decent to good game in my view.

I didn't know what to think after the long hype cycle and some negative reviews that said this game was tedious to play. Took a chance on it and was very pleased!

The theme of this game is throughout and the auction theme is a particularly nice touch.  Not usually a fan of auctions but I am surprised to say it felt very natural and necessary.   The quality of the components are great and the colors pop on the table.  

There is strategy not only tactical moves. The pepper table is quite intuitive contrary to other reports and was easily memorized halfway through our first 2p game.  Harvesting reminds me of Five Tribes in that each time is a mini puzzle. Can you AP? Sure.  Are they fun decisions and can you play this game as quick as they say?  We did even with some 2 min think jobs in the final rounds.  Lots of fun to play and theme quenching!

A very neat resource generation game wrapped up in a lovely theme of cooperative gardening. It just feels slightly underdeveloped with a playtime that sags in the middle as the game struggles to transition into its "afternoon" period.  I also can't shake the feeling that it is lacking one or two more mechanical relations. For instance, i only wish the contracts mechanically felt different to that of the recipes. As it is, you are only ever exchanging peppers for points; could the contracts offer more special abilities? 1 Phantom and 2 brown for an ability to refresh a used ability token, or perhaps a contract which allows you to sell up to 10 peppers in a turn, or maybe one that allows you to 'dig up' a pepper from the garden and re-plant elsewhere. I just feel there was room there for extra zest/heat. And then the money. Ah, I only wish I could enjoy it for what it is (A very happy and playable gateway experience) and not come away from it with ideas for more.

In all, I think this is worthy of filling a gardening, crossbreeding niche in someones collection. Beyond that, my ultimate complaint is that it is only playable; a damning critique i know!

Not my style of game at all. The spreadsheet and challenge of combining peppers to create combos to fulfill the chili menu or market sales just feels like work. Then there's the spatial component of planting / harvesting which can completely mess with any plans, so that only adds to the frustration. The production is ok, although the pepper pieces got a little stuck in the board.

Pretty fun game.  Maybe a little too complicated for the simplicity of it's theme.  There are at least three cycles running inside the game, movement, placement, two purchasables, a turn order auction, etc.  Lots of moving pieces, it all works well together, but it's a lot of moving pieces.

Very smooth and flows well. The physical placing of planting a pepper is also satisfying. I especially enjoyed moving along lanes of the field to harvest. Scoville is very intuitive, and easy to both grasp and teach. As a con, nearly every turn, there was always at least one action in the turn that felt less meaningful. Individually, each choice is exciting, but when combined, they becomes a hazy (though entertaining) direction towards an objective.

Way too long for what it is with five or six players. We are talking two and a half hours...

The game is quite streamlined, and isn't hard to learn (expect the end-game/mid-game triggers that is...). The turn sequence is intuitive, but on the other hand the game is somewhat repetitive...

With the right crowd, that can accept the facts that in this game you can be nasty to eachother, and that turn order matters a lot (determined by blind bidding btw...), and can accept that they have to let go off their need for control,  this game seems to be fun and entertaining.

The two times I have played it however (both times with 5 players), the game has bogged down in to a AP-fest, simply because people can't let go, and just play the game and learn from mistakes. Many people get stuck in fear of making a mistake, that will give another player the opportunity to exploit that mistake, and make a ton of VPs. 

The game is AP-prone, no doubt, simply from the facts that timing the turn order correctly is important, keeping track of what peppers I can get next turn is hard, what other players have in peppers behind their screen matters (which recipe are they going for?), trying to anticipate were the other players are going to move their farmer etc etc...

This has the unfortunate effect of making you focus more on the chart than your strategic goals, and playing more tactically.  The first 7-8 rounds feel random to me, in that you really don't have enough control of the board to set anything up and will be subject to the whims of others.

The harvesting concept is interesting, and the whole game is fairly thematic.  Definitely enough strategy with the variety of purchases and costs, and bidding on player order can be very, very important.  I feel like Scoville takes some of the great aspects of games like Power Grid and Stone Age, dilutes them, adds in the area control field and harvest phase, and spits this out.  It's pretty solid, but for the 2 hour time length, I would like it more if it were less tactical and more strategic.

The main focus of this game is the planting and harvesting of peppers on the board, hoping to collect the proper colors before your opponents do.  Unfortunately the main part of the game isn't all that interesting.  People often unknowingly help or hinder you.  This game is more frustrating than fun.

I've only played this game with 5-6 players. In the last few rounds, the game suddenly grinds to molasses speed as AP kicks in even on the most unsuspecting of players.

It took 2 hours both times.

If you would like a similar experience, play Fresco. Shorter time.
OR maybe just play this game with less people. The AP might not be as bad.

I don't really know what to say about this one, it really had me both liking and loathing it at the same time...I really liked the idea and the theme of the game (as will, I imagine, almost everyone who sees it), it's colourful, bright, and seemingly straightforward at first.  I really loved the idea of having all all the different colour combinations which provided different routes to victory.

However, it very quickly became apparent that the game is a complete slog - every turn (particularly in the latter stages of the game) each player sits there and min/maxes until they're long in the tooth and it all sort of loses it's charm.  You may argue that experienced players wouldn't suffer from this but I would disagree here, as the game mechanics create so much chaos that if you manage to create a game plan between your turns, that plan will have to change by your next turn leaving you to think from scratch and forcing everyone else to sit and wait.  It seemed to me that the creators attempted to cram all the mechanics they could into this box in order to get the maximum interest from their Kickstarter page.  There's worker placement (with very strong blocking and denial), variable turn order, resource management, there are a tonne of cards available for purchase, auctions at the start of each turn, 10 different chilli colours along with money and VPs....the list goes on.  The game lacks focus in my opinion, and it took far far too long to play.  Nice idea, failure to deliver.

This was sort of a weird game. The turn order in particular is interesting in how there are good reasons to be going first but also good reasons to go last, but ultimately I just ended up feeling like no matter what something was always out of my control and I was just left hoping. Which is really not my thing. I think it may have been mitigated a bit with the elimination of the hidden trackable information. As far as I know, someone with a perfect memory could have all of the point totals and all of everyone's available peppers known at all times, and so since that's the case my preference would probably be to just leave it all open. If you know what everyone has you can know if it's worth racing them to something or not, rather than just be left hoping.

Scoville is a solid design that is both easy to learn while still providing a nice degree of complexity. The mechanics provide a surprising amount of agonizing choices, where doing something to help oneself often helps others. There game features a combination of confusion about perceived values from different players (which leads to some fascinating results in the auction for turn order at the start of each round) and an optimization puzzle that grows in complexity as the game develops. For as interactive as it is, it may not be as tense as it could be (there are so many paths to points that is possible to have at most a handful of moments of denial from other players), but the appealing theme and interesting mechanics make this game a positively pleasing pepper puzzler.

A euro about pepper farming.  You plant peppers and you harvest peppers.  For the peppers you don't plant, you can exchange them for various resources and points, you can sell them, or you can collect them to later claim largish amounts of points when you have a particular combination in demand (assuming nobody beats you to it). If that description sounds like it might appeal to you, then it probably will. I wasn't really able to get into it, but I don't think it was the game's fault.  It just wasn't my day for Scoville.

Lots of options to get points to modify your strategy.

In Scoville, players are members of a chili-cookin' farmers collective (I gather) collecting ever more hotter chilies from the communal farm to sell at market and to cook ever more hotter chili on the road to victory. The game comes with 10(!) different colored chili-meeples that players collect in order to fulfill the demand on market and recipe cards. The core mechanics of the game are very simple, but the way in which hotter chilies are collected can make for a bit of a brain-burner (pun intended).

There are three ways that players collect chilies - by auction, harvesting, and through small conversions through the farmers' market. It feels like this should be called a "resource-conversion game", but that label doesn't quite fit. The conversions available through the market cards are limited and pre-determined from the initial draw. Every turn-order auction grants a pepper or two, but your most valuable peppers are usually acquired through the harvest. Every turn players plant a chili to the central grid and in the harvest players walk between up to three pairs of chilies to collect a color that each pair generates, according to a cross-breeding chart. Deciding what color to plant where, and then what options are available to harvest (there are many paths to take) and how those peppers will help you in recipe and market fulfillment can create a lot of analysis each turn. Without that analysis, the game would take 30-40 minutes - the analysis doubles or triples the play length. This game will give AP to players who don't normally have it and playing with someone with natural AP tendencies would make the game unbearably slow. You want to be able to trade or buy chilies directly, but that's not an option, which opens the question that for all of this analysis, in such a tactical game, how much control do you really have? I suspect that even if the lack of control is a bit overstated, there is still not as much control as a lot of players would like.

So level of control is an open question for me. Also, you either like the analysis of chili cross-breeding, or you don't. You are either okay with periods of everyone staring at the board in silent meditation, or you aren't. I enjoy it, but because it is such a large part of the game, I could never play this game with someone who didn't enjoy it.

Being a pepper aficionado, the theme of this game really caught me. I would like to play it more, but so far have only 1 play in a 2-player game. Although it was a learning game for both of us, and so took longer than what one could expect in a regular game with expert players, I could tell that this game is likely to play slowly for many groups. The potential for AP is high. I don't think I would want to play with more than 4 players and will likely concentrate on 2 players unless I have a great experience with more.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Everything in the game is trackable, yet there are screens. People often say the removal of screens will slow down the game, but I am of the exact opposite opinion. Making decisions based on fact is a lot faster than trying to remember specifics and reason out an optimal move with imperfect information. For me the screens greatly detract from the experience.

Blind-bid all pay auctions are a terrible mechanism. 

The cross-breeding is definitely interesting, and reminds me a lot of Fresco. However, it is oddly unthematic to be manipulating the breeding of plants in a game with a single morning and afternoon phase implying we are playing over the course of a single day. The theme really doesn't hold together well at all. On the bright side the names of the chili recipes are very creative and fun.

Movement around the fields is very slow! You often have very limited choices as to which peppers you can harvest and deciding to venture one way or another will greatly impact your harvesting for several rounds. By itself this is not bad, tight restraints on resource collection can be good if people can make informed decisions about which resources to collect. However, with the fog of the player screens it becomes difficult to plot a course. If someone surprises you by grabbing the recipe you've been working towards you may be punished on multiple fronts. Not only do you fail to claim the recipe but if the peppers are not useful for other recipes and you find yourself in a bad area of the fields to change gears, then there is very little you can do to recover.

My play with 5 was far too chaotic. It is terrifying that the game even has 5 on the box let alone 6. I would happily play this again at 3p to see if the game can shine at that number (and without screens). However, I suspect that this is, at best, a mediocre game which is meant to be more 'fun' than strategically engaging. All together quite disappointing.

Scoville has clever ideas but fails in executing these ideas. Not to the degree of not working but the mechanisms creak enough to annoy me. The main culprit is the bidding for turn order which is too digital (first/last or otherwise irrelevant) and a movement system forcing gamey manoeuvres. Room is left for creativity but there are better honed games around to be played instead, e.g. Age of Steam for the turn order bidding or Santiago for the planting theme.

Excellent little game with an interesting theme that you don't see often.  Sure, we can be pepper farmers!  Who can resist the little pepper meeples?  Trying to earn the recipe points or the plaques, all that is fun.  And of course there is the high level of screwage that can take place in the garden as players block each other from getting to those precious combinations.  There is some nice meat on this game.  I think the 2-4 player count is better for this game, not sure I'd try it at higher player counts.

As far as "get cubes, trade them in for VPs" goes, the planting/harvesting in this game puts a nice twist on it.

Good components and original theme.

Includes bidding for turnorder, one of the most annoying mechanims ever. Here it is extra annoying because the bidders choose their position so it is even harder to predict which position you will end up with. It is also especially annoying because turn order reverses between phases. Don't like the harvesting mechnism.

Too much player conflict and screwing with each other. 
Too long and AP inducing.

Hits all the wrong buttons. Reminded me of "Rockwell" another game I loathe.

Solid game with original mechanisms and lots of indirect interaction. Even though the game's core is the set collection mechanisms, the bidding phase is super important, and games will be won and lost because of it. Being able to outbid your opponents whenever you're planning to score a big objective is crucial.

In terms of mechanisms, the only issue I have is the hidden information component: there's virtually no need for it, as the gathering is public to begin with. It just adds a memory element, which makes the game confusing and frustrating for those who loose track. But this can be easily fixed with a house rule, so it's not a true issue.

The biggest issue I have with the game is related to the components: the different peppers are extremely hard to tell for each other. Considering non-colourblind people have issues identifying the different colours, the game must be a living hell for colourblinds. While fitting peppers on the board is cool, it ends up being gimmicky, as it would've been better if they were more physically different from each other, to easily tell them apart.

In any case, it's a solid, engaging and fun game. It's a pity its production, even if pretty, is impractical, and ends up holding the game back.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

I found it enjoyable as well as a bit thinky. I'm not a fan of blind bidding and this one makes a lynchpin for turn order which can be crucial, particularly when ties maintain relative order, sigh. However, the peppereeples are quite nicely done and the grid movement is interesting in both placement of peppers since they generally produce something based on what pepper is on the other side of the path (but harvesting happens in opposite order of planting so there can be blocking and such as well). Also, brown peppers get in the way and block production with most other peppers so they can be an irritant in the harvesting phase as well. Although we share a communal field where we all plant, apparently we don't allow our fellow farmers in the field to come walking through though...

Previous comments:

In this game, you plant peppers in a field and then harvest them to complete recipes and achievements. You start with basic colors (red, blue, and yellow), planting them in combinations that scale all the way up to the silver ghost peppers. The board and components are great, and the gameplay changes enough from play to play that I don’t think it’ll get repetitive like I initially feared. This is one of my favorite games I’ve kickstarted!

Update: I actually sold this at GenCon this year because I just never wanted to get it to the table. :/

A very interesting theme for a game.  You plant peppers of different colors after a quick auction at the beginning of each round.  You are trying to manipulate where you plant so that when you harvest you will get more valuable peppers to fulfill orders and get advantages or score points.  I liked the game a lot.  The only reason I don't rate this excellent is that it does not have enough peppers in the game to cover higher player counts.  It is a bit silly that not enough were included.  It might be worth waiting for Scoville 2.0.

Growing peppers never seemed like fun. This makes it moderately so.  The pepper chart might seem daunting at first, but it quickly flows easily.  The only jarring part of this game are the rules about transitioning to the second phase, and how the game ends.  They are far from eloquent, and I honestly don't see why they had to be so convoluted.

7-7-17--bought from the nicest guy at DTC 2017 & ffs I can't remember his name and Miles put the box it came in into the recyclables before I looked at the label!  I can't believe this!  We played so many games with him...arghh!  Anyway, we had played Scoville and it was a lot of fun, Miles and Casey and I all thought so and I happened to mention it to this guy and he said he hated the game and would GIVE it to us!  So I gave him $25 and he sent it to me!  Cost him $13.50 to send it, I think.  If only I had looked closely and read his name right at that moment.  :(  Miles and I played it today (7-22) and we still love it.

Los turnos me parecen irrelevantes al menos que tengas el primero o el último, pues no tienes ninguna inferencia en el tablero. No me parece que la subasta sea interesante, los movimientos están limitados y en general nada del juego me pareció innovador. De dos personas me pareció muy malo y de seis muy largo.

Hmmm...not really sure how I feel about Scoville. It's certainly light. The toughest decision to make is typically where to harvest. The fulfillment stage is rather painless, as is planting (just see if you can get bonuses, don't give anything useful up that could be used for a recipe, etc.). The bits are interesting. I love how cute the game is, and the art by Josh Cappel is awesome. However, the quality control is lacking, to say the least. Almost 1/3 of my peppers would not fit into the spaces on the board. That's ridiculous. Interestingly I had the same issue with Belfort. Again the pieces were all nice, but I had a major issue with the cards chipping as I removed them from the shrink. I have to deduct 1 point for that alone. Another point is deducted for how the play bogs down during the harvest phase. It's just inevitable, even if you're not AP prone. So that's where I'm at, somewhere between a 7 and 8. I think I will split the difference and give it a 7.5 for now. Hopefully it grows on me later. As it stands, I'm holding onto it for the components and unique theme.

Rating based on one 2-player game. Fairly short, fun and puzzle-y game which will be hell for the colour blind. I can see this tripping some serious Analysis Paralysis and being too chaotic at higher player counts, but would like to play 3 or 4 player.

Further comments after 5p game: game was about 2 hours with one AP player, sometimes feels like there's too much to keep track of, and not enough room in my brain for it, so moves can be 'may as well' ones. Did ok off a money-based strategy, but not sure it's properly viable. Fun, but more intensive than it looks!

A unique spin on the standard economy builder/worker placement game. Similar to games such as Lords of Waterdeep or Viticulture, the player must start with basic resources and build up their pepper empire by carefully purchasing, planting, picking, and profiting off of the fruits of their labor.

While there is a lot of complexity to this game, each part is relatively simple and intuitive with the game ratcheting up in difficulty when taking everything into consideration and being aware of what other players are doing.

The pepper crossbreeding chart seems very involved, but makes sense after a few playthroughs (primary + primary = secondary, primary + secondary = brown, etc.) and other actions such as selling peppers or cashing them in for recipes is fairly basic/standard.

With that said, the communal pepper plot is probably the most unique feature of the game, as everyone must grow the plot from the same starting area and there is a strategy to placing peppers in a way that maximizes benefit to you while minimizing benefit for other players.

As for the game itself - the board design is sturdy, attractive, and smartly constructed. The pepper and farmer meeples border on overproduced, but they add a certain something to the game that simply using blocks or tokens wouldn't be able to achieve. Card design is fairly basic and the game goes a good job of conveying information in a streamlined and simple fashion.

I'm curious to see how this stands up to multiple playthroughs and larger player count games, as that will ultimately determine the longevity and value of the game.

First playthrough of the game went about as long as advertised with 4 people.

Cross-Breeding mechanic was interesting and not nearly as ocnfusing as people made it seem in discussions, big thing was to harvest at each movement rather than try to figure things out at the end.

Ran out of meeples for the more rare peppers near the end after a bunch had been planted.

Strategy wasn't clear at the end of the first game but more plays should help with that. Everyone had a great time!

A very fun well themed set collection game and grid movement game with a dash of auctions. This game is very vibrant although the art is fairly lacking. Seriously, there is not much art beyond the board. I very much enjoy this game because of the higher player count and how easy it is to teach the game. Its very fun to predict how your players will plant and you can gain their rewards and even block them. I usually play away from other players on the board but sometimes that is not possible. The lab is a great expansion too with more recipes and the lab itself. I usually will try to get this out when i want a medium weight game with a high player count. 

Sell. not for trade.

Grain of salt here, because I've only played at the max player count of 6, but it was overly long and awful. The "plant for everybody, harvest for yourself" dynamic sounds fun but it's just frustrating. I don't like blind bids, and turn order is extremely important here. I don't like single-achievement public goals. Just not for me.

Thought I would really like this one, but first impressions were somewhat meh. I think overall it was too much work for not enough payoff. Had to really think through the whole planting harvesting thing to figure out how to get what you want, and even then it still might not work out. Half the time I didn't care what I was bidding for turn order, since I didn't want to take the energy to figure out what I needed. Very AP prone- would definitely not play this more than 4 players. Lots of bits for setup and takedown, too. Love the art and theme though.

An oddly charming game whose design enhances typical, albeit solid, Euro-style mechanics.  Includes a bit of spatial relations, but in a really entertaining way.

RATING: 8.15
To start, amazing components!! Those Peppers are awesome and make the board shine 

The game is also great... but I think it will be better with 4 players... with 3 there's a good amount of interaction between the players but I think that with 4 it will be just perfect and there will be a lot of more peppers and more pepper combinations to make!

The game is simple but can be a bit of AP inductive... but not much unless the players just stay there trying to figure out the perfect move... 

I'm AP prone but I didn't took to much time to decide my moves... the game was also pretty quick, so, another game with a good balance for weight and time...

I don't like memory elements in games but curiously I normally like games with screens because that allows for some bluff and deduction and I feel it also cuts out some of the AP the game can generate because if I can see all the information available I have more data to compute 

And this also adds a bit of a gambling element to the game, specially in the end of the game.

Still, check this if you like euros with cute theme. :)

It's sort of like a worker placement game, but the workers are moved on a grid instead of simply placed on a space--worker movement, if you will.  I liked the pepper breeding mechanic, but I didn't like that I couldn't always benefit from them efficiently with my harvest actions.  I'm not a fan of the auction mechanic, either.

Nice components and some interesting mechanics, but I didn't find this game to be particularly fun.  Jockeying for turn order is a key mechanic here, and it's not one of my favorite elements of a fun game.

Also odd is that this is such a theme-heavy game, but the theme doesn't hold up to scrutiny -- the players are, what, wandering around the same field picking up hybrid plants...?

It suffered from some poor graphic design choices (recipe cards were too hard to read across the table since half of the recipe cards are taken up with the word "recipe" on it.) There should really be a marker added between each pepper as it is placed to show what color pepper it produces. As is there is way too much referencing of the pepper matrix to try to understand the state of the board. I could see with repeated plays that it may become second nature, but my first play felt tedious because of this. I did like how the peppers fit into the board though. I would never seek this game out, but would try it again if someone really wanted to. I'd like to try it at the 3-4 player count too (my first  play through was at 6 players).

I didn't expect much from this endearing little pepper planting game. Maybe it's the simplistic artwork or the way the peppers fit into the field that reminds me of preschool. But I ended up really liking this game. The theme is unique and refreshing and the mechanics it employs make sense: placement, mission fulfillment with a little of Alchemists' deduction grid thrown in. The one mechanic that consistently threw a wrench into everyone's plans was the reversal of the turn order in the harvesting phase. If you were the first to plant, you are the last to the harvest. This always made strategy a little hard to plan around. Another facet was the blind auction mechanic for turn order at the beginning of the round. No one is acting with perfect information which is one of the best aspects of the game. Scoville is a very interesting, unique worker placement with a few twists to keep everything exciting and tense until the very end.

Based on one play: You collect peppers by planting and harvesting them, but depending on which pair you harvest you get different peppers. There are quite a few colors to keep track of, luckily the game comes with some player aids. But then there are the cards that you finally trade these peppers in for. There are a lot of cards and you can get blocked so watch others. We played at 6 and it was not really fun, just chaos as everyone just tries to get some points and not lose a card right before they were planning to take it. Might be better at 3-4 but doubtful I will play again.

In Scoville, players plant peppers on a communal grid board, and then move their pawn around the board harvesting new peppers, by moving in-between two peppers.  The two parent peppers you move between determine the type that the harvested child pepper is, defined by an easy-to-read and logical chart.  The peppers are turned into points by a) being among the first to plant a certain type of pepper, and b) contract fulfillment.  The board play is very tactical, and though there is turn manipulation, it's really hard to know that another player won't snipe the sweet combo you put out unless you go first in the harvest round.  There are also "get there first" issues with the contract fulfillment, as the communal contracts can be very complex and you may spend a large portion of the game achieving the big-point ones.  However, the game is very well-produced and very intuitive, and provides a good play experience.

This review may climb if/when I get a chance to try it with fewer players, but putting 6 players on the box is criminal, one of the few games I've ever asked to be excused from because it was one of the most intensely frustrating experiences I've ever had.  The weird way the turn order plays out makes any kind of long term planning an exercise in futility which isn't great for what seems like a strategic euro game(not a tactical one)

I got to play this at my local meetup today and it was an interesting take on spatial organization mixed with color mixing like Fresco or Pastiche. You are chill farmers competing to see who is the best farmer by placing your chill and harvesting them. End game scoring comes with the objective cards (2 types) and whoever has the highest point wins. I got lucky with this game because I always went last but the game makes it so you go first in harvest so when your fellow players didn't cutthroat and block you off you can still win at the end.

RATING: 7
When I first read the rules, I already had the impression: 'nothing new here'. Unfortunately, that impression was confirmed by my first play. The plantation thing is somewhat new, but basically the colour mixing has been used in other games as Fresco or Experiment and in it's heart it's a resource collection game where you always aim to get the most valuable resources and convert them in as many points as possible, as seen in so many other games before. 

Not that there is anything bad about this game, absolutely not (otherwise I wouldn't give this a 7)! It just reminded me of Eric W. Martin's statement 'new games are for new gamers', because if you play boardgames for about 5 years, you'll probably just have the feeling of 'been there, done that'.

Components wise: the coins could have been a bit bigger and the 'red' is typically 'Chinese red' :s

Very fun and enjoyable.  Great theme.  Bidding for turn order choice is good as it can vary if you want to o earlier or later in the turn order.  Farmer movement to crossbreed peppers is cool.  Just the right amount of different ways to score points.  Is fun and fits into a good time frame with 2-4 players.  Haven't tried it with 5-6 yet.

Played at a game night. It isn't super deep, but not really a problem - it strikes a nice balance for overall complexity. I think some character special powers for purchase would make it a bit more interesting - things like crop rotation, clearing an area, etc. The turns feel a bit underwhelming - especially at the start of the game.

This is an extremely clever game about farming peppers, where you plant peppers into a common field, then walk a meeple around the field grabbing peppers from the box based on the combinations of pepper colors you stand between along your walk. Then you turn the peppers in for points or money. It's got fantastic fundamentals and intellectually I like everything about it. It feels a little like Fresco, the way you combine colors and race to complete objectives by turning in specific sets of colors. The only problem is this game comes with HEAVY analysis paralysis. We were all feeling it almost with every move. Time between turns with 5 players was almost too much to deal with, and this game can go up to 6 players. In the future, I don't know if I'd play this with more than 4, which is sad because the more players you have, the more planting happens, and the more movement blocking can happen.

9 - This is probably the highest score I would expect to give a euro game.  It's not normally my thing but the game doesn't drag on too long, there's plenty of decisions, choices and consequences for turn order, and there's just enough player interaction to keep people involved. Each game I've played has gone down to a few points between first and second, but unlike other euro games this was not some auto-balance it was because they both worked for it. The last game was 86-85-85-62-58 and the final decider was one last famers market trade for a few points and a black pepper which was in turn sold for 5 coins getting that last point needed to edge out the win.

Planting and selling chili peppers? An enjoyable game but not one I need to own. 

A blind auction manipulates turn order. Looks like it usually best to go either first or last. In the 3 phases first choice of peppers to select, and first choice of contracts to fulfill. However, the movement of the pepper farmer on the grid of planted peppers is reverse order so it can be used to block other. 
You are trying to collect sets of peppers for contracts or to sell for needed cash, Also be first to pick the special pepper. 
The more rare peppers are mainly collected from walking the fields, and brown peppers which commonly get produced, frequently block production when placed on the grid
The game seems to revolve around the ability to strategically place the colored peppers so you can collect the more difficult ones to produce, while trying to fulfill the limited contracts.

More boring version of Fresco. Pure (read: dry) resource-manipulation game with the least interesting type of scoring; resources are converted to points as sets so that the value of each resources is independent of the set but if you fail to get the big set you were aiming at then you lose right away.

Avoid at 6.

A economic engine, cube exchanging game.

Unique things: It feels like a game from the early 2000s! No special powers to purchase or earn. The economic engine part of the game comes from the 10 different kinds of peppers; the more valuable peppers give you the ability to "breed" more or better peppers, and/or reward you with more points.

We thought the AP would be atrocious in this game. There seems to be a lot of information to digest: In a 6 player game, there are 24 recipe cards (goal cards) all face up, in addition to I think 12-18 morning/afternoon cards (goal cards that give less points but extra peppers or cash for auctions) plus six cards, each of which are rewarded to start turn auction winners, and a crazy huge multiplication table to tell you which combinations of peppers yields what. All this information, including the multiplication table, is easily digested, in small part because relations between the 10 different kinds of peppers are related to colour mixing, not pepper breeding.

I think what turned everyone off to this game is that most of the players played Splendor right before. Both are exceedingly dry. But Splendor is over in 30 minutes and is far, far less fiddly.

I am an original kickstarter backer of this game and am very satisfied with the final product. The artwork is bright and catchy and the design is very streamlined. It plays quickly, but still has strategic depth. I enjoy sharing this game with gamers and non-gamers alike. The rules are accessible and the theme is fun. Best player count is probably 4, but it is still fun with 2.

A game of farming peppers and cross-breeding peppers to get to more "powerful" peppers (ability to access more points via recipes or plantings).  But unlike engine building games, this one felt very tactical as one simply optimizes each turn to the best of their ability.  There is some strategy in where in the turn order one needs to go, but the choices aren't that intriguing at lower player counts.  I suspect the game becomes more interesting with more (5 or 6) players, but that will bring with it more analysis paralysis as each player performs their optimization slowing the game down.  This inelegance (for lack of a better word) lowers the rating to "run of the mill" for me.

--Jan2015-- It's a cool exercise:  though I'm not completely confident that navigating the farmer movement is possible as an advance planning exercise.

I don't really know how to rate this game. I had fun for most of it. But I hate a few aspects of it.

A) Blind bidding for turn order is really annoying. It just seems to me like a completely stupid way to do it. Especially when turn order is so crucial because...

B) Single use public goals annoy me. I clearly should have bid more to make sure I got the one recipe, but now I am left with a pile of peppers that is completely worthless.

Ok, I am annoyed just typing that out. I guess I do know how I should rate the game.

My three-year-old really wanted to play this despite my protestations that it would be too complicated, so I agreed to play with her.  I took out the auction phase, simply alternating turn order each time, we skipped the special power tiles, and she decided she was done after the morning phase, at which time we counted points and determined she had won.  Maybe there's some hidden genius in the turn order bidding, but it seemed like the core of the game with the pepper planting and harvesting was sufficiently random and opaque that I could be beaten by a three-year-old without any attempt to throw the game.

Scoville started out as a 7 for me after my first couple of plays with 2. It's cute and fun. But I didn't really see anything too interesting or unique.

Then I played with 3 players and started to see some more depth. That's not to say it's not good with 2; it's an 8 for me at 2 now, also. I just started to realize the strategies about where to plant peppers, harvesting first or last, timing the fulfillment phase correctly, etc. I am interested to play much more of this one.

RATING: 6.5
There are a few interesting things going on. For instance, the decision of whether to go first or last is genuinely tough, and I enjoyed that. And the whole mini game of the workers in the field is fun, especially how you can block people, or put a pepper out of reach of someone. But there's just not enough here to pull me in. It's too long and too AP prone. Nothing wrong, but nothing unique, either.

The one big problem I have is that there aren't enough peppers. My 2nd edition came with multipliers, but that doesn't solve the problem. In a game that gives you player shields and keeps everything secret, having to turn in three white peppers to get a multiplier token is awful. You just gave a bunch of "secret" info to the other players. Bad, bad, bad.

Played at GenCon 2014.  Beautiful game, interesting mechanics (especially blind-bidding for turn order, which does not necessarily mean going first), various ways to score, fairly tough choices to be made (which sometimes means being patient and deferring actions until later).  Actually being able to play this game (having not seen a run through) sold it for me.  My teenage kids loved it and were engaged the entire time.  Cannot wait to get my own copy.

I can honestly say that this is the best pepper farming game I have ever played.  Joking aside, the game has awesome components, including a rainbow colored array of wooden pepper tokens that fit neatly into the board's pepper-shaped holes.  The game itself seemed fairly strategic though it is easy to see how it'd take just one person to aggressively block a harvest.  Could be prone to AP or "take-that" mentality but it was not a problem in my session.

Great name and unique theme, but auctions and spreadsheet manipulation mechanisms don't seem to fit at all.  This leads me to believe that the theme is totally pasted onto the game.  Based on the rules and videos, this game does't look fun at all.  The box cover is ugly too: there are far too many shades of yellow, gold and brown, the name doesn't stand out, the clouds don't really fit, and the chili pepper is not prominent (but I guess that's okay since the game really isn't about chili peppers or the Scoville scale anyway.

From Spirit Games

Good little theme. Very Fresco-ish feel to it - with an auction to decide where you want to go in the turn order. Go 1st gets you best choice of peppers, first chance to plant your peppers and first oppertunity to sell at the market or make chilli recipes. However you will go last in the important harvest phase (Similar principle to mixing colours in Fresco), thus possibly getting locked out of gaining peppers you may need.

Moving around the pepper field in the harvest phase reminds me very much of Darjeeling, which is no bad thing either.

There are a few ways to get V points - be the first to plant a certain colour pepper, create chilli recipes or bonus points for selling to market. plus ponts for coins (3 to 1) at game end.

Wifey already a fan after her initial play. Probably due to easy to understand gameplay with no fiddly rules or many icons to memorise.

Great 2 player gameplay. May drag on a bit at the higher player count.

I forgot about this one for a while, and when I re-read the rules I dismissed it as being a light set-collection game. Then we played it for the first time this week, and I have to say, I'm impressed! The combination of buying from the farmers' market and going for recipes after is a great mechanic, as well as the harvesting mechanics. Played very well with 5 -- seems like it adding people doesn't extend the playing time.

Set collection game with some very interesting tactical pepper placement and farming mechanisms.  Players plant peppers, then move along a path between them to harvest peppers based on the two surrounding colors. Although it is different in a lot of ways, this game feels like Ticket to Ride in the way that it plays (which is a good thing).  Two players is a highly tactical and very interesting experience.  More players increase the complexity, but also increase the game length.

Scoville is one of those point-salad min/max exercises where you're not so much playing the game as trying to get through it. When I played, nobody was focused on the game, which made it drag on longer than it should have, but that's largely because the game was boring. There's too much turn-to-turn chaos to plan ahead and there are too many possibilities to map out in a reasonable length of time. So you're left with either interminable calculations on each turn, and watching other people do the calculations, or quick but woefully suboptimal play.

1 play, 5er (4 newbies)

One of the latest games from Tasty Minstrel. It has some pretty cool bits: peppers in thickness (height) corresponding to their value, that you will be sticking into holes (which [i]almost[/i] all fit!) in the board as you plant them. The game has the switching turn order per phase mechanism of Power Grid, the color mixing/building of Fresco, and set-collection/recipe-fulfilling of any number of other games. Players will bid for turn order (choosing the position they each want). Then they plant a single seed, move their meeple around and harvest (color-mixing of the 2 seeds on either side of your meeple), and turn in a set of peppers to fulfill contracts from the display. Each phase happens in different order (regular or reverse turn order) like in PG, so the first and last players will each get a double turn -- pretty powerful since recipes (and VP awards for planting certain peppers) are first-come-first-served! That can make planning a bit difficult, too, since the board / recipe availability will have changed by the time your turn rolls around ... hello, AP (our game took nearly 2 hours)! Turn order, based on a blind bid (!), can be VERY important and, especially at the end of the game, leave you with little or nothing productive to do on your turn!

Component-wise, things look pretty good. Unfortunately, some of the peppers don't quite fit in some of the holes; minor problem. Worse, the board is pretty tiny; that, and the fact that meeples are relatively tall, means that it's sometimes difficult seeing all the details easily. It's also easy to knock down those meeples (fat fingers!) as you move them around. And there aren't quite enough peppers in the game -- we needed to use substitutes to fill in for some peppers near the end of the game.

There's little truly original here, but it is a well-designed game that uses those mechanics well. Still, for slightly lighter fare I think I prefer Fresco; for heavier stuff, I'd stick with Power Grid. This is likely better with 3-4 players, which I might be willing to try but I doubt I'll be seeking this one out again!

1 play, 5er

Interesting game, reminds me a lot of Fresco although the board play is somewhat different. I like the varying turn order (depending on which phase of the turn you're on), where you can bid to try to get a specific position to try to get a double turn (either plant-harvest, or harvest-sell). And I like the board play and color comboing, for the most part, although with fewer players I think everyone will likely end up in their own corner of the board. Turn order, though, seems inordinately important, especially when contracts are running low near the end of the game.

Comments from first play: With 6 players this game took 2.5 hours. Choosing between the different usages for peppers (planting, selling, farmers market and chilli sauce) of which the latter two offer more than 10 options each, there was a certain amount of decision paralysis and trying to evaluate a good course of action in face of the complex pepper crossbreeding grid was pretty difficult. The game per se works well, but I guess one has to play it rather often to get to a more fluid game experience. I am also not sure how much strategy is hidden in the different mechanisms.

RATING: 5
I enjoyed playing this, but I doubt I'd want to play it often.  I liked the back and forth of turn order, but if I am going to play something this tactical, I'd rather it was a little more clever like Five Tribes.  It's not quite interesting enough to make up for the AP slowdown.  Our group did play quickly, and so it was fun, but I think it would slow down a lot in a more AP-prone group.

The game also has some graphic design problems that are an annoyance, and it is awfully swingy.

Very fun!  The mechanics match well with the theme.  I wish it were a little easier to tell the purple peppers apart from the black ones in the card illustrations.  They're different thicknesses, but that's not always apparent in the pictures.  It also seems as though some sort of track showing how many peppers of each type have been planted would be useful.  It can be hard to tell in a multiplayer game.  Overall, I really liked it!

RATING: 6
Some interesting things going on the game, but it kind of felt flat to me. There is tons of money going around but not much to spend them on. Why not have some improvements that let you build your own little engine of making peppers? That would definitely elevate the game heavily. Finally, there are a few weird rules that feel like they limit strategy. Specifically only being able to sell 5 peppers of one type on a turn. Why not allow more sales? Then planting and growing and selling might be a viable strategy compared to simply going or the ghost peppers and scoring huge points with recipes. I would like to see more paths to victory and more interesting decisions going on rather than just the general straightforwardness that is found. Has potential and is okay, but it feels like it is just one big expansion away from being good.

Based on one play.  My first impression was that I didn't really enjoy having to try to first remember, then line up specific color-producing combinations, to produce colors that then needed to match up on different sets of cards that give you points.  That's just personal preference though - I can definitely see how people would like this game.  I just find all of the pattern matching more tedious than fun.

The mini-game of planting, harvesting and moving is quite interesting - and hard. The colors are hard to read, particularly on the receipes, and the wooden peppers that are supposed to be red aren't. Lots of needless friction there, but enjoyable still.

tl;dr: fine but unoriginal

Some games should not have been published. Bad games should not be published because they are bad. Other games should not be published because they don't bring anything new to the table. A game working fine and being mildly enjoyable should never trigger a publisher to invest resources into publishing it. Yet with the advent of crowdfunding that is happening a lot. And this game falls squarely into this category of games that work perfectly fine but don't do anything new. An original theme and nice components and artwork are all nice things to have, but that is not enough to entice me to dig up my wallet. No, I need more than that. An unoriginal game that is surprisingly fun to play, or an original game that manages to be enjoyable despite it's original ideas, that is what I'm looking for.

So yeah, if you get the chance to play this, you might as well go ahead and do it. It's an OK game. But I wouldn't advise you to go out and buy it sight unseen.

A additional small point on game play: I found the game to go on for a bit too long. Not necessarily time wise, but it did get slightly repetitive towards the end.

Really great game, lovely to look at but the components let the game down. The pepper cutouts are cut completely wrong in every copy of the game meaning that you can't fit peppers into around 5-6 holes. If you try to force them in there you will ruin your board. Also had a smashed pepper but that happens with a lot of games and they are replacing it. Unfortunately they won't replace the boards.

That said, Scoville stands on its own, and I'd gladly play again.

Ah, the pepper game. The first key part of this game is the turn order mechanism, which makes it reminiscent of Five Tribes. This game twists that around, however, in that the turn order is relevant for 3 separate phases, and the middle one is done in reverse order! I think that's pretty cool. The second key part is route planning to get the peppers cross-breeds you want, which has that classic blocking mechanism that all eurogamers know and love.

I kinda wish fulfilling the recipes was a bit more satisfying, though. In Five Tribes you finish your turn with a magic genie or a cool palace meeple. In Scoville, you get... the name of a chili recipe? The reward shields are also underwhelming.

Still, a game where the journey is great and the destination is good.

This is a game I keep around because it's super accessible and plays up to 6 people.  That alone makes it worth while.  The game itself is interesting enough but pretty light and I don't feel super invested in my play.

It's fun enough though, the production value is good and it inspires poop jokes which is always a plus.  And the play time is super reasonable at 45-60 minutes.

Five players may have been too much for Scoville. I enjoyed the puzzle of placing peppers and plotting out your harvest, but too much changed on the board between placement and harvest at the higher player count. I'd like to give it a try again at three or four players.

I'd heard nothing about this game at all, so I came into this blind.

The game is about planting chile peppers and making chili recipes... where the hotter the chili the better. Every turn there is a blind bid turn order auction, and you get to choose one of the pepper cards that comes out based on your turn order.

On your turn you plant a pepper, in turn order, then move your guy on the fields three steps, in reverse turn order. You get peppers based on what two pepper fields you walk between, which ends up being a color blend mechanic much like Pastiche... red and blue peppers combine to make a purple pepper, etc.

There are lots of recipes and the ones that score more points require rarer peppers. There's also some points you can pick up for being the first to plant rare peppers. And there are points and money that you can get for selling pepppers in the market.

Most of the game comes down to trying to get the best path through the fields and screwing other people out of a good path. But it's hard to figure out how to do that effectively. You want to both go first in turn order, so that you can get the best pepper card and also claim recipes first, but also go last so that you can walk the fields first.

It's an interesting game, but ends up feeling a little puzzley

Unique euro game that involves collecting chillis from a field by mixing the colours of other chillis. Fun and strategic game. But sometimes victory can be out of your hands leading to a lot of wasted energy for such a long game that can leave you feeling a bit empty.

Scoville a standard resource-harvesting, set collection Euro with a elements of an auction for turn order as well as a spatial puzzle during resource collecting. In other words, Scoville is a pretty run-of-the-mill Euro design. There are many successful Euro designs on BGG but there are a few design choices in Scoville that does not sit well with me, and hence the lower than expected rating.

First, the positives for Scoville: it is a decently short game and does not linger too much with 4 newbies to the game,  90 minutes  for the first game is a pretty decent pace. The game elements are not hard to grasp except perhaps the the spatial element during harvesting chilies. I love the theme. There are lots of agricultural-themed games around, but this is the first one focused on chili peppers. 

Where Scoville fails as a Euro is the extreme tactical nature of the game. It is quite tough to gauge and plan specific routes for harvesting chilies as it really depends on your positioning on the map. Many times, specific chilies you require are not on the board either because the chilies are not planted or other players occupy the space you need. While the auction determines turn order, it still feels very tactical as you player position influences where you can go. Going too late means others already occupy the spot and going to early means that spot is previously preoccupied. A lot of times, I harvested chilies without quite knowing when or where it can be used. 

The chili recipes are all laid out in the beginning. While this helps longer-term planning, it can be daunting to scope through 18-20 recipes in one sitting. Moreover, both the recipes and the square cards all require set collection of open face objective cards.. It is tough to see your painstaking efforts which you have planned for the last 3-4 rounds being scooped by your opponent.

In the end, Scoville struggles to standout in a sea of Euros. I likely won't be seeking it for my collection.

One of the primary mechanics of Scoville is how you move your farmer around the board to collect peppers.  It's not the only thing you do - there's bidding at the beginning and you can claim two types of cards for points, money or more peppers - but it does feel like the most important.  It's that part that reminded me of both Istanbul and Five Tribes.  All three games are different, and yet they all share something - how you move on the board.  Of the three I see Scoville as easily the weakest and least interesting.  Five Tribes is a brain burner and Istanbul is somewhat thematic.  Scoville just feels clunky in comparison, especially with the charts and the alleged "breeding" of peppers when a farmer steps between two different kinds of peppers.  It makes sense, but Istanbul makes more sense.  And Istanbul offers cleaner play.  

I'd play Scoville, but I see no reason to own it with Five Tribes and Istanbul already in my collection.  Beautiful game, however.  Just not enough there.

Decent number of interesting things going on, but it didn't especially grab me.  The mechanics in general work together well for the most part.  It can potentially be extremely swingy at the end with a few dollars determining a 40-point difference against another player.

Be forewarned the market cards are extremely hard to see clearly with the brown background, so be careful to ensure you know what peppers you're getting.

Also note that there SHOULD be an auction in the first starting round of the game as long as players feel they understand the game well enough to know what they're bidding on. (The designer agrees with this.)

First play, the game is surprisingly lighter than I thought.  I don't know why I had it in my  head that it was a more complex game.  It reminds me of other set collection style games like Finca.  The communal farming on the board is the novel addition to this game and it is a fun mind game, trying to guess what all of the other players are going to do while also setting yourself up.  I know the blind bid aspect can really turn some people off, I always enjoy that though.  It's quicker than back and forth bidding like in Five Tribes, you just make a judgement call how much going first is worth to you, and to the other players  and hope you win.

RATING: N/A
Enjoyed this game, though I can see why with several plays, even with variability in player interaction depending on who is playing, this game might get slightly repetitive. What makes it interesting is the board and the things that happen on it while harvesting. Turn order is big for harvesting and also for picking up bonus markers and getting first pick of resources from the cards. I would love to play this at max player count. We played at 3 but 2 people were in one corner on top of each other and the other person was by himself doing as he pleased, which I realize was our fault, and won him the game, though not by a huge margin.

RATING: 4
I played this once with 6, which clearly was too many players- I'd like to try again with 4 before writing this game off.

My first impression: the spatial harvesting mechanic is very interesting in theory, but in practice the game is too chaotic and mentally fiddly. There is so much information to process that my perceived choices were either to engage in analysis paralysis (tedious and rude, and likely futile) or just play entirely tactically, getting the best peppers I can and then seeing what I can afford during the acquisitions phase. Playing the game at this shallow level is of course equally unsatisfying and incongruous with the time the game takes to play. I would have preferred if Scoville brought more focus to the spatial element by simplifying its auxiliary mechanics, something that the game Charon Inc does very well for example. Or perhaps with fewer players and more experience the balance will feel right.   I'm a bit skeptical.

Nice game, flows very smoothly (though movement can induce some AP), nice inclusion of a spatial element and I like the simplicity in teaching this game. It is a shame I've heard colourblind people having a problem with this which limits my play with some groups. I do think the afternoon and end game triggers could be a bit smoother.

It's not one I get massively excited about but it's one I enjoy and can play with groups where I think I'd struggle to get a heavier game to the table. Also scales very well all the way to 6 which is a big bonus and one of the reasons it has replaced Viticulture in my collection.

A hot theme, but the game thematically doesn't make a lick of sense. Why are the most bountiful peppers the most expensive, while the rarest pepper could be worth $0? What recipes consist *only* of hot peppers? The most intriguing part of the game was harvesting, but even that was a pain in the ass with having to look up the cross-breeding possibilities before every move. If you are not the first player, planning your harvesting could very well be moot which makes for some significant downtime between turns. I see little original except the theme and the theme is some pretty weak sauce.

RATING: 4.5
Pros:  Very Pretty game. Unique pepper harvesting pepper mechanic.  Seems fairly deep in ways you can strategize. 

Cons:  Red, Purple, Brown colors all look the same on cards.  Have had multiple people have issues going for a goal, just to find out they were going for the wrong colors the entire time.  

Board warping is an issue and can be annoying, especially with a lot of player harvesting. 

This game can lead to a lot of AP and blocking, and the "Achievements" while incentivize people to play peppers, are too easy to get and are a bit too strong.

The core rules of Scoville are super solid and elegant. The component quality is truly fantastic. Everything just works. The problem is that I can't find ANY fun in this game. I don't want to to be staring at the crossbreeding chart half of the game and reference all the rows and columns just to figure out how to get the perfect combination of peppers. It's just way too tiresome. I know that there's a lot of strategy here and many people will find this game entertaining, but for me Scoville is just a boring chore and an analysis paralysis inducing nightmare. I don't think I would want to play this game ever again.

And just as a sidenote - I'm not colorblind, but the colors of peppers on cards and on components are slightly different, it's not that hard to mix up red with brown and purple.

Scoville fell a little flat for me. It has a lot of good things going for it: a fun theme, great artwork and components, and interesting mechanisms.

However, I have three issues: the plaques, analysis-paralysis-inducing decision trees, and common victory point conditions:

- The plaques are likely worth too much in a game where 70 points or so is a winning score. 
- The AP starts from the very beginning: deciding where to go in player order, are you going to go early to get fulfillment or late to get an unblocked harvest? At most, you can only be the first to do two of those things on any given turn (planting and fulfillment), and everything you do will depend on those that have gone before you. Worse, you [i]can[/i] logic out what people are going to to and you likely will, but it's going to take time. I'd rather that it was more or less obscured so you didn't have to take as much time or didn't bother trying to figure it all out. 
- The recipe cards vary wildly in amount of points and the kinds of peppers required. If you're going for a recipe that nets you 22 points and requires peppers that not many other recipes use [i]and[/i] someone else gets to the recipe before you, you're left sitting on at least a few peppers that are mostly worthless to you.

This is a game of planting peppers of different colors and breeding different combinations to create new colors. You gain points by being the first to collect specific colors, selling different combinations of peppers, or by combining different combinations of peppers in receipts. It has a strong euro feel too it, so if your not into that you might want to avoid that personally I like the way the game plays. One thing I would caution about though is that even though the game is set up to play up to 6 people, that many players really slows the game down. I have only played it with 2 or 6 players, but I suspect 3 or 4 players would be the sweet spot and I would like to be able to try playing with those numbers still.

Good attempt to make pieces work for colorblind players, but sadly fails since the market and recipe cards are too hard to discern. Others at the table can read the cards for the colorblind player without breaking the game. Scoville isn't a deep game.

The moment I opened the box, I knew I'd made the right decision. The absolute only issue I have with the game is the absolutely tiny money tokens. There's just no reason for them to be that small. I'm going to lose them constantly.

With all six players, the planting field is incredibly cluttered, at least initially. And the boards sort of lift in the middle, so pawns tip over frequently. (EDIT: in the second game, the boards were a little flatter, and the pawns were mostly okay)

And those damnable tiny money tokens! I may replace them entirely.

Love the concept of this game and the decision making... really struggle with the colors between the peppers and the pictures of the peppers on all the recipe and other cards.

Original, but not so challenging game. I like the blocking on the field element.

Exceedingly colourful game about farming chilli peppers. A mix of different mechanics, it's surprisingly easy to learn and a bit of brain burner sometimes. Players plant chilli peppers in a communal field that cross-breed to different colours with adjacent peppers. The harvested peppers can then be used to fill recipes and orders for points, or replanted in the field to provide more options.

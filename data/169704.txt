Man I love playing this game. It takes exactly one full turn to get what's going on - which rarely makes a difference, but it's a very good 3 to 5 player game. I like it best at 3, as it takes just enough time to not overstay it's welcome. At 5, money becomes too scarce. But I really like it, the vault reveal is an innovative mechanic, and adds a lot of "gambling" to the game - which caters to a lot of my gamer friends.

I liked playing this game a lot. The theme was very creative, like fantasy storage wars. I like the attention that was paid to detail such as different flavor text on each piece of junk. The different characters were interesting.  I like that each vault was slightly different in what information you had before making your bets. Very cool game.

A solid little auction game that uses the theme quite well and includes some lovely artwork.  

Players each auction off vaults full of equipment and lots of junk, but each auction changes according to a wide array of rules that specify how much info players receive and they types of auctions.  

Players also have hidden objectives that guide focus their attention on certain items.  Money throughout the game can often be quite tight, but can also fluctuate wildly.  Assessing values can be tough and knowing when to time your bid or whether to get caught in a bidding war adds to the tension, as does the limited information available to each player.

Lots of text on the cards slows down initial plays making the game slightly longer than it should be, but I can see the game being faster once you become familiar with the cards.  There's a little bit of fiddliness and downtime in setting-up each auction and explaining the specific rules, but overall a light, enjoyable game for those who like auction games.

I really enjoyed this game. The theme and the mechanics are fantastic, my only issue that is that a couple of the player identities, one in particular, feel incredibly overpowered. I may need to play it again after removing that identity from the game.

Had a GREAT time! Lots of laughs when I sold someone a vault with all junk and a dragon's egg (after he sold me a vault with all junk the previous round). Some great bluffing, great interaction, a little salesmanship. The only downside is it took us way more than 1 hour to play even in our second game. Would play anytime.

RATING: 8.2
Clever idea for an auction game, taking the 'Storage Wars' reality TV concept and applying it to bids on dungeon treasure troves! You're not blind bidding, per se, since you'll get to see or peek at some items in each haul, and you can also draft the Vaults to begin the round. Art is cute, and there are some character cards which apply different effects, like a loan shark that adds some strategy and risk with corruption tokens. Good to see a nice idea come together in a solid game. Enjoyable.

Initial rating, 2 plays with 3 and 5 people. Very fun game, simple with a little bit of strategy and "gambling" (you don't really know the full contents of the vault you're buying).

Pros:
- box art, size and quality
- design in general
- clear rules with summary on the last page
- lighthearted fun

Neutral:
- don't play this with AP players
- people new to gaming might have problem with understanding vault descriptions

-----------------------
I have been interested in trying this ever since i saw videos of it from Gen Con 2015.  Always skeptical of kick starters from no name publishers, but this one is really neat.  A really different auction game than anything else on the market, and I found the theme to be fun.  Need more plays, but I could see this one rising in rating...and is probably a top 10 contender for 2015.

Wow, what a fun game. Vault wars is really easy to learn and to play and there could be a surprising amount of strategy. You have to really try ot manipulate your friends when you're auctioning off vaults, which is a blast. I convinced a friend to buy a relly lousy vault for like 10 gold....made me feel great....

I payed extra on kickstarted to get real metal coins from fantasy coins llc and man was it worth it. These components are my favorite of any game I have. They look and feel fantastic.

There is a surprising amount of replayability too, more than I thought. Depending on what hero's you get (characters that give you a bonus at the end of the game) your strategy could really change pretty drastically. I only got one play through so I didn't try the Worker expansion (not sure if this was kickstarter exclusive), but that would also add a lot of variation.

There is a lot of risk-reward going on as well as you try to decid which items to keep, sell, or equip. This was one of my favorite new games and the best of my recent kickstarter releases (Evolution, Exploding Kittens, Vault Wars).

It doesn't have the elegance of another pure auction game--Modern Art--but it does have more theme and variety due to the vault special powers. Initial plays are going to be slow due to everyone having to read all of the cards at auction and there is a lot of stuff to track. But none of it is difficult, and the game quickly speeds up with repeated plays. 

Unfortunately, it's a bit heavier than a filler card game, and I don't think the auction mechanic alone is enough to carry a medium-weight game.

Neat auction and theme work together very well but the game is marred by glaring hero imbalance. Lots of fiddly rules and slight confusion on what to do with the vaults won, but they serve to add variability and theme. Ultimately long for the depth provided.

I like that each auction changes and players bid with different knowledge of what is in the vault. I seem to like it more than others.

Haven't tried the workers expansion/variant yet.

The premise is great, but somehow in the process of keeping track of vaults and bids, players become disengaged.

I got this because my wife likes Storage Wars and thought it would be fun to play this fantasy version.  Then I saw it was 3-5 players on the box, which complicates things, but I still hope to get this to the table soon.

Update: I got it to the table, and while I enjoyed it with my game group, I'm not sure my wife would like it. But with the 3-player minimum, it doesn't work as a couples game anyway, so no matter.

RATING: 7.6
Vault Wars is a clever little auction / bidding game with a fun theme and tons of interesting decisions.  It's a medieval-themed version of Storage Wars the TV show, and just like the show, players need to bid on lots of goods with imperfect information about the contents of those lots.  What really adds the special sauce is that each of the vaults has a different special power, ranging from simple rules tweaks to fairly absurd twists.  On each round, players must choose one of their vaults secretly, weighing the value of the special ability, number of items the vault will contain, and the initiative order (important when you need money badly, since you get paid for the bid on your vault).  The layers of bluffing that go into what cards you reveal, which vault you choose, what you bid on others' vaults, and so forth are all really interesting and highly interactive.  This is a game that, while slightly tricky to teach, goes over very well with newer gamers, while still having enough meat to keep more experienced players engaged.  If it becomes a bit too easy for your group, the Worker mini-expansion gives you some more options to tweak the gameplay and layer on more decisions.  Also, if you got the Kickstarter deluxe edition, the metal coins from Fantasy Coin, LLC are absolutely gorgeous and feel great in hand.  In fact, all the components in the game are outstanding - the cards are nice and thick and feel good, the magnetic box is excellent, and the tokens are good in both the deluxe and standard editions.

There are only two slight negatives that I would mention.  One is that, like other games that involve paying other players, it can be difficult to recover from a bad or unlucky play in the early game.  The Loan Shark helps mitigate this to some degree, but it can still be frustrating for a player who buys a vault full of junk for too much money in the first round, and never feels like it's possible to recover after that.

The second is that the game sometimes feels like it goes [i]slightly[/i] too long for what it is.  From a gameplay perspective, it's a fairly light, social experience, but it can definitely go beyond an hour, especially if anyone has AP.

However, if you can keep your decisions snappy, and bluff well enough to get yourself back in the game if you get behind early, this is a really enjoyable game.  I definitely recommend it.

If you like random auction games (with little control) and are a fan the show Storage Wars (I assume, though I have never seen it), you will probably love this.

If you are averse or neutral toward auction games, or want some control of your own fate in a game, nothing to see here, move along.

Each auction requiring extended setup and explanation is just... ugh.

Auction game where each time there are different rules of engagement. I believe that one game is enough to understand the gross interactions of the game, the learning curve is not steep at all. 

Nothing new here, the only thing is the bluffing mechanics and the general fantasy theme which make this a beer and pretzels game worth hitting the table for some time. But I wonder how much replay value will this have, since I believe it could be a little repetitive after a while.

This game could've been mediocre.. but EVERY! vault card (the card you auction off) has some special wonky rule you have to read and apply, this makes the game sooooo random / wordy & thus boring.

I really want to like Vault Wars - I love a good auction game - but it really fell flat for me.

The game runs way too long for as light as it is, with almost every auction introducing a special rule and requiring players to shuffle, draw, and read cards before the actual auction can commence. That makes it especially tough to play with new players or without someone keeping the game moving.

An even larger problem is that there isn't enough information to make informed decisions. There are too many points at the game where players have to make a blind guess. Thematic, perhaps, but fun, it's not. It also takes away from the fun of figuring out what players are seeking and whether or not they get those treasures. Much of the fun of watching those reality cable shows this game mimics is the big reveal of whether the treasure is there or not - and this game keeps that part a secret.

In the end, Vault Wars is a great idea that could have used more refinement.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (October 2015)

Vault Wars  is a fun bidding/bluffing game. I didn’t know what to expect but I liked the game (I have never seen Storage Wars).

It is very easy to teach, however the playtime can be a bit longer that I would have preferred but I still like the game. The game components are very good (the metal coins from the KS edition are AMAZING!) and the art is great. It is hugely thematic, each junk card has a different quote that’s fun to read.

Each vault modifies the game´s rules in some form and they are a lot of them so each game is different and it has a lot of replay value. I like bidding games, but what I really like is the bluffing aspect. You can make a player spend a lot of money in pure junk :Devil:.

Best with 4 players.

Bottom line, a fun game I would play from time to time. I wish it was a round shorter.

This the fantasy version of the TV Show "Storage Wars". Dead adventurers have left behind their stashes and supply sheds and enterprising profiteers are auctioning them off! Every round each player puts a vault up for auction. Each vault contains from 3 - 7 or so items. This is a partial-information auction where, depending on the vault, different players have different information about what's in it. Only the auctioneer knows all - usually. The auctioneer gets the winning bid as payment for the vault, or they pay the bank if they win it themselves. The items are worth any combination of money, points, or abilities. Many are worth more money or points if you combine them into sets first. Between auction rounds, players can sell up to four items and need to pay to store the rest until the end of the game. At games' end you get points for items, money, and an end game bonus chosen from two goal cards that are dealt at the game's beginning.

Fun in concept and mostly fun in execution, there are some pretty obvious flaws here. For example, money is worth very little at the end - getting almost any Vault is likely to be worth more - which saps all tension out of the end auctions. May as well just compare money and have the player with the most pay one more than the next lowest player. The selling limits and the different rules surrounding "junk" cards don't flow as smoothly as they should. Feels too gamey at times. I'm not convinced the end game bonuses are balanced either, but I need to play more to be sure. Some of the cards are a little unclear. I feel like all of these aspects could have been tightened up in development and if they had, we'd have one of the best light auction games available! However, here we just have an average game with a fun idea. The family likes it, so I'll keep it around for a bit. Could have been so much more, though...

EDIT: Lowered my score a bit because of game balance. There are some WAY overpowered cards here that just need to get removed or seriously reduced.. 6 points per vault?? Should be like 2 points. How did this ever get past play testing?

Quicker game with a nice theme. The game plays like the show "Storage Wars". You are bidding on vaults of treasure from heros or villians past. You only get to peek at a few of the items and the auctioneer sets the price, are you buying a sweet load of elven armor or are you stuck with a nasty dragon egg? You start with two character cards that dictate your "objective" and help you bonus off what you've collected from the vaults. Easy to teach, simple bidding and card collecting. Plays in 45-60 min, teaches in 15 min or less.

FIRST IMPRESSIONS:

This was an obvious KS game in that the rules/card text were at times not totally clear. Outside of that, it was an entertaining auction game which reminded me a bit of the reality show Storage Wars but in a fantasy setting. The kicker is that every item one keeps one must pay $1 to store after acquiring which adds up over time.

Auctioning stuff on which players have partial information does not create an interesting bluffing game for me but just too much of a random crapshoot. Then there is also the silly aspect of drawing the vaults where some players get great ones (and thus receive lots of cash of others) while some get crap and will be poor. Not worth playing.

First game played had the issue with understanding the Rogue's special ability (https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1413616/rogue-aspiring-hero-bonus). Be sure that in future games, the players discard or trash ALL vaults UNLESS they are labeled as Items. Great game and fun with 5 players.

22/10/2015 - 6,5. First game. It was ok. We had fun. I wonder how much this depended on the group, and how much on the mechanics. I got stuck for two of four rounds with no money and very high vaults, which I could sell only by the end of the round. The game is promising, however, and I will give it other chances!

I backed it at the time because I really liked the quirky fun theme of this one and the gameplay from Rahdo's video was pretty cool...

And I have to say I'm not disappointed... not one bit... the game is indeed pretty coll and fun...

All the guessing and double guessing, the bluffing of what is put in the Vaults and the reactions when you get to peak at some stuff in it... that alone is worth the price but there's also a pretty interesting game there also, and I think this will be even better with 4 players!

A cute little auction game that's obviously based on the TV show, Storage Wars, but with a fantasy setting. Admittedly, I didn't get into the theme as much as I thought I would, but mechanically-speaking, the game works well enough without taking too many risks. The interesting wrinkle I found here was that the auction master can only bid once, and it has to be the opening bid. I do feel like money could be tighter in this game, but as the game goes along, it becomes tougher and tougher to maintain a suitable amount due to keeping items to score at game's end. I enjoy this one though. There aren't that many good auction games coming out these days, but this one is excellent, especially if you can buy into the theme.

UPDATE: I recently re-played this, and it didn't hold up nearly as well. Cool idea, but a bit too much swingyness in what you receive in the auctions.

It's nothing but auctions. Each auction at least provides a variation on how many cards are in the auction, how many are revealed to all, and how many each player gets a secretive peek at. So that provides some interest. I like how your secret mission drives you to bid higher on some card types over others, and how your accidental pickups then drive you to collect similar. But there's a lot of accidental pickups, and there's a lot of auctions, which makes for what seems a pretty random affair. It reminds me a bit of Goa, where the order of being auction master (and therefore when you collect your money) drives a lot of your bidding power and your interest in various lots. Happy to try again to see if it improves with added card knowledge though.

Any auction game that isn't Modern Art must be compared to Modern Art. Which unfortunately doesn't do any auction game favors. I like this game after a second play, and I think it's got an amount of randomness and flimflammery to keep it light and fun, but it takes about the same amount of time as Modern Art. Since Jon Gilmour made it, it'll stay in my collection, and I'll continue to indulge it, but it's hard to justify having multiple games of a single time when you've already got one as powerful as Modern Art. Is it just me or does this feel like comments on Modern Art.

Theme carries this one a long way. As a hoarder and a fan of fantasy in general, I naturally get a bit giddy at the idea of collecting large piles of magical goodies and junk. It helps that there is a fairly balanced auction system attached, even if some auctions seem a bit too restrictive to allow a satisfying amount of control.

I played this game with 3 other people who have all seen the show Storage Wars.  I never have, though I know the premise, so didn't get the references and jokes the other players were making.  Nevertheless, this is a very unique and enjoyable game.

The game is an auction game with a fantasy flair and a lot of neat mechanics.  Each round a player puts a vault up for auction.  The vaults each have 3 values to them.  Number of total treasure cards in the vault, number of face up treasure cards from that total, and number of cards players can look at in secret.  This means each player (except the vault owner) typically only has partial information.  Each vault can also have a special ability that mixes things up even more.  The owner of that round's vault sets a price and bidding continues around the table until all but one player have passed (if nobody offers the price set by the auctioneer then he purchases the vault for that price, which could be beneficial depending on the contents).

Each treasure has a point value, some can be equipped for a special ability (but forgoing their point value), and they can be sold as well for money to use in future auctions.  There is also a ton of junk which is good for nothing since even just having it means you have to pay storage fees between rounds (although some equipment can make use of the junk).  Each player also has two private goal cards, from which they will choose one at game end for bonus points.

I thought this game was very good.  The bidding was supplemented by partial info, special abilities, hidden goals, etc. making the gameplay deep and varried.  The only gripe I have is that it can run a little long for a small card game.  And reducing the number of rounds hurts the balance of the game because there are cards that work based on number of those cards owned.  It also might be a little light on content  for many plays but that's what expansions are for.

Lighthearted bidding game that has some strategic elements added with the varying point modifiers from the characters. I love the bluff mechanics that some vaults offer by allowing the auctioneer to determine which cards are revealed, adds a nice interpersonal customization. Unique flavor text on the junk cards is a big thumbs up for me. It seemed a bit long at times, considering the game being played, perhaps if there were less rounds/total vaults it would play more tightly.

Preliminary rating after 2 plays, both with 5 players.

Production is great, love all of the components and it comes in a wonderfully portable box.

It's a fun concept for a game and the gameplay was fun as well.  Possibly a bit much playing with 5 players all new to the game, there were lots of questions during play which brings me to the point that I feel like the game sits in a bit of a weird spot.  The game takes around an hour which is a bit on the long side for what feels like it should be a quick filler, there are a lot of finicky rules and every vault takes some reading and understanding and explaining to each other player.  The rules are simple, but there are so many different scoring paths and kind of fiddly rules about storing items and visiting the Loan Shark.  It's really not bad and you understand it all after one play, it just makes the game not as easy to teach as you'd expect.  It's a game that takes one run through to get the kinks out before you can enjoy it.

Because of that, the game is not very newbie-friendly. A lot of having to restate storage fee's and such.  There might also be a bit of a rich get richer vibe to the game, by nature if everyone is playing well, one person might win a lot of money selling a vault early on and profit from it.

Overall it felt a bit odd how massive the scoring boosts were for each persons special.  One person is trying to win Armor at all costs, one person is trying to get Junk, One person is all about Gems, but it's all a bit of a gamble what they actually see in each vault.  I would hope this would lead to more bluffing scenario's, but I didn't see as much of that as I expected.

I worry that it sits in that weird spot where it's a bit too much to teach to my light-gaming friends at work and family, and probably too simple for my heavy gaming friends.  Will see, and update my rating as I experience it.

My experience of this game was that the only fun came from the theme. Otherwise I don't know. I don't get that kind of bidding game when other players dictate your ability to do ANYTHING in the game. You mostly bid on a random list of objects and hope to get something valuable while it can all be trash. Then you´re out for the whole round. You cannot even affect your own bidding round. I liked the cards combination thing to earn more gems, but I have never been able to choose the time when to get cards, even bad ones. You´re just lucky to get cards, period. Then this dude reveals his crazy mission card netting him a million gems while you sit with your +4 gem per dwarven object with none in your stash. Ultimately unless you´re in for a couple of beers and joking about the silly theme, there is no game I can enjoy. You end up paying for crap cards just for the hope to be able to combine them later to earn more points. Truth is, it's not up to you to decide if you can. I truly hate games that do not give an even chance to each player. And then money doesn't even give gems in the end, or close to nothing. I think the biggest problem in this game is that it's not worth selling the objects. That's it folks. being able to sell that sword for 10 gold instead of freaking 2 would mean that you traded off an item you don't need to be able to bid better next round. But since there is no real money to make out of selling items, you just sit and watch all game and stop caring about the cards you have in your pile. Terrible game. Why not bidding on each card maybe?

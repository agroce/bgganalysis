GAME: Fortress Europa
RANK: 3130
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Extremely playable simulation of the war in western Europe from D-Day onwards. Allies not restricted to historical landing zones and Germans can set up hidden units (within certain limits) so that the Allies can get a nasty shock when they land. The Germans can create a strategic reserve to launch their own Bulge or else husband their forces for a measured defence of the Reich. A great game which I'd rate higher only for the dated graphics. If the new L2 version is as playable as this with the graphics they are capable of then the new version will be fantastic.

FE is The Russian Campaign in the West.
More difficult than TRC though. Game has a very good and tense opening. Allied need to get ashore and has to choose from 5 different landing zones. Tension is very high here. Then just before the middle game a second invasion needs to be planned and executed. More chrome then TRC. Longer playing time also. Should be bought in companion with the russian campaign if it comes out in a new editon in 2004.
Played it only 5 times though and was beaten terribly each time.

RATING: 7
The worthy successor to Russian Campaign, and the baseline "one map" WWII strat/operational west front invasion game.

Graphics -- counters were excellent for the time, and still solid 30 years later; map was/is... not real pretty, but does the job, and is the weakest part of the game.  Another gloss white glare-fest ala Nap War and Peace of the same era; easily remedied with some light green marker or other light wash.  

Gameplay is cluttered on the map, long with weekly turns, and it's a generally tough slog for the German side, getting pounded turn after turn by allied air, but the CRT and some good unit differentiation make it varied and fulfilling, and it usually matches the history.     

All in all, I haven't played it much, but when I make the effort to embark on it, it scratches the itch every time.

Similar to The African Campaign, this is a step-up from its Avalon Hill predecessor, but falls short of the mark set by The Russian Campaign. The gaming experience feels unnecessarily tedious due to the counter clutter with divisional units and the weekly turns. Not a bad strategic overview of the Second Front, but less might have been more. Extra copy was sold.

This is a super game which is very similar to John Edwards' The Russian Campaign, but set in Western Europe.

The first time I played this was against Ivo Jerenko, in his apartment at Bondi Junction.

We started at about 6:30 p.m. The next thing I knew was that I looked at my watch and it was 3:30 am - that time went very quickly.

Old fashioned heavy duty stuff; this is a well designed and nicely produced game.  Probably balanced; although it has some problems, they are fairly easily fixed.  It is extremely, if not to say dauntingly, long, but offers an intense and immersive experience.  I'll collate the required amendments shortly, including banning German paradrops, no combat across the dyke, some requirement to involve both Allied armies from the initial invasion and, I suspect, some dampening of the late campaign Allied activity levels.

    Good game.  Lots of choices for the Allied player.  Once the Allies (If) crack the Axis lines around the beachhead you can see why Germany was forced to retreat so quickly.

A great game of the western campaign WWII beginning with Normandy. Unfortunately it took me a couple decades of shelving it and playing only a few turns before I could play an entire game and it also took me a couple decades to learn to like it. The hardest thing to overcome for me was I couldn't accept the game system's mandatory combat rule for units adjacent to enemy, and the double impulse thing.
Coming from lower echelon games (Firepower, Arab Israeli Wars, the two Panzer games) and higher echelon games (Rise and Decline of Third Reich in its new release days), I found it difficult to accept the game mechanics of Fortress Europa.
What it doesn't do very well is replicate grand strategic decision-making. Neither does it replicate well combat at the lower tactical level.
What it does extremely well is replicate decision-making, trials, tribulations, objectives and concerns of Operational level campaigning. The Supply and support aspects are very abstracted through the use of Headquarters counters; yet very "real" in that FE's supply rules are extremely deadly and WILL force both side to husband, protect, and keep in reach of those HQ counters every turn, all through their campaign.
Now I love FE, would like to play it all the time and on Vassal if anyone wants to give it a go let me know!

There are so many good things about this game, but once we learned that the Germans should rush their army to the Siegfried Line as soon as the Allies break out (the line then becomes unconquerable) it was just the same game over and over.  If you amend the rules for the Siegfried Line, it plays well.  I've played this game a lot, which says something.

For more fun, in the AH version, try at least once to cancel the rule of frozen German units during invasion turn and make SS Armored available as Von Rundstedt wanted.

The Jedko version is easier to play, with only 7 pages of rules and more freedom in German setup.

My second ever wargame.  I have always found this game a bit too fiddly, and therefore uninspiring.

Unlike The Russian Campaign - with its grand ebbs and flows and The African Campaign - with its smaller scale, but perhaps more dramatic swings of fortune, Fortress Europa involves a steady build up on one side and decline on the other.  In other games (like Storm Over Arnhem) I have found that a delightful way of building tension for both sides.  But in this I have found it more hard work than anything.

My feelings about the game are relatively ill-informed:  it has been many years since I played.  But faced with a choice between three similar systems, this was always my third choice, even back in the late 1970s and early 1980s when I only had three choices.

The game tends to repeat itself if anything other than a wildly variant Allied landing pattern is pursued.  Not surprising but somewhat disappointing.  In a recent playing Market-Garden actually worked but the Panzer Reserve cut through it after the Brits were over the Rhine and ruined the Brits for the rest of the war.  The invasion reaction, supply, replacement, air and Panzer Reserve rules combine to keep the game balanced so it can be played any number of times to a satisfyingly tense conclusion but one can't help but feel trapped within the construct of history. 

This can be a good thing, but too many what if's are left unanswered.

Strong game.  As the Allies you pick an invasion point and press the matter home.  As the Axis, you repel the invader if you can and failing, you make them pay for every inch.  This game works pretty well.  I don't have the advanced air rules, but they are supposedly better.

This Avalon Hill version Of Fortress Europa (1980) is far well advanced & developed in comparison with the first generation of the game which came out by Australia's  Jedko Games (1977). The 1980 version is by far & large better balanced, advanced & developed in terms of airpower, replacements, movement rules. If you are a big fan of playing the old D-Day style games, this is the ultimate game for you. I have both the Avalon Hill & Jedko Games versions of Fortress Europa in my collection & it's worth hanging onto it. This game maybe a far too long in terms of time consumption, but it is ultimately worth it for all those Western Front enthusiasts. This game is also the dark unknown brother game of Russian Campaign.

This is clearly a heavy wargame that I would love to play, although finding someone to play with would be a challenge.  If I had people to play this with I would have it as a "1" on my wish list.  After looking around a little more, there appears to be an understanding that some wargames would be better to start than others.  Because of this, I think this would have to be put a little lower on the list of "must have" wargames.  Bought it on eBay for a steal.

My favorite 1944 France game. I was shocked the first time I played it when my gaming buddy threw my invasion force back into the sea. That is when I realized (at 13 or so) that maybe this whole D-Day event was not the sure thing that I thought it was.

I spent a lot of time playing this back in the day. It was one of the first AH games with double-sided counters and they were quite handsome, although the board art was boring and also the maps stopped too far West in Germany (I made up my own board to reach Berlin).

The mechanics were good overall, although I was never a fan of the compulsory attacks - there was always a one-hex no man's land between the two sides.

The OBs were at divisional level with some major non-div units. Stacking always penalised these and the selection of which non-divs were portrayed is hard to understand - for example no artillery or combat engineer units are shown. This would make it hard to optimise a force eg for a river crossing or to attack the Westwall.

Overall though it was a manageable and plausible game. 

The AH General did a good update of the (very abstracted) air war which gave both sides some leeway as the use of their strategic air forces.

I played this game way back in the mid-80's.  It just took too long to play a game for just 2 players.  I like the game but find myself not having a good time due to the length of the game.  Back when I played this I probably would have given it a 6 instead of its current rating of 4.

Russian Campaign on the Western Front.  A bit one sided with the Germans basically on the defensive the whole game.  But, historically accurate.  German player must specialize and enjoy damage control situations along the entire front.  Best German player advise: make the Allies come to you piecemeal and destroy them in limited, local attacks.

Haven't played for years.  I like the concept of sweeping, continent wide war games with hundreds of individually designated units but in reality the time required to finish FE proved too much for us. There is no scenario play so it is all or nothing (Jedko ed).

Jedko's "The Russian Campaign" comes to the Western Front.  Compared to a god-awful wargame like AH's D-Day, this was superior in every regard.  Given my druthers, I'd much rather play Russian Campaign -- once the egg in Normandy cracks wide open, there's not much "game" left in Western Europe.

While not a gem like its father The Russian Campaign, Fortress Europa is still a pretty solid recreation of the campaign in France, 1944. This game adds a fair amount of additional rules to handle air power and the cross-channel invasion, but it's by no means a highly complex game.

OK, maybe a 9 today, but I spent so many enjoyable hours playing this game that it gets a 10.  I bought two copies.  It was superior to any of the AH games of its time, with step reduction, impulse movemet and detailed rules for things like air and invasions.  The map wasn't pretty, but what maps were at the time.  Lousy luck on the invasion could ruin the allies, but this is historical and came closer to happening than many realize.

I loved this one when I was a teenager, but I no longer have the time this game requires.  It's a shame, because I know what I'm missing.  I would highly recommend it to those who like traditional wargames (esp. Russian Campaign) and who have some time to kill.

Although "old-fashion" ("I-go-You-go" plus hexes and dice), this is one of the best classics ever. I've been playing this game for ages now, and still feel the same pleasure and excitement. A bit of fog of war here, and a bit of air superiority rules there, give this excellent wargame the chrome it just needs to make you feel the thrill. As the Allied player, you choose your D-Day landing site(s), and as the German player, you have real opportunities to throw him back to the sea, counterattack when winter comes...or do nothing but fight back until the last turn.
In a nutshell : this son of Russian Campaign (another classic) is a must-have.

Old school classic. Not as clean as TRC and suffers for that, but a good game that I played a few times back in the 80s. More interesting than AH's original D-Day, at the price of some complexity.

Fortress Europa covers the war in the west from D-Day into 1945.  The Allies try to get ashore, and are given choices where to land.  The Germans need to delay the Allies as much as possible early on, before the steady stream of reinforcements and Allied air power wear them down.  Good, enjoyable traditional hex-and-CRT war game.

I bought this game just a couple of years after I got the Russian Campaign. This was hyped as the companion game to it.
And the two do have an awful lot in common. The maps and the counters looked a lot alike. The play style and rules are very close to the same.
But it just never got played as much. I think that's just because there is just so much more interest in east front games than west.
It is still a pretty good game and a dramatic improvement over AH's earlier game D-Day which was just plain ugly.
But I don't think I've played it but once in the past ten years now. 
But if you got a beginner who likes Russian Campaign he might just like this one too.

Although dated compared to games like Mighty Endeavor, the game still has some merit.  It's a lot more fun to play the Allies than the Germans so you might want to play this solo.  Despite 11 pages of dense rules, the rules still have some gaps and I am not very fond of some of the movement, supply, and zones of control rules.  Still it is still fun to play a game of this magnitude, plot your invasions, determine your air missions, and manage your troops and supplies.

Definitely a favorite. Russian Campaign in the west. Ok, it has some flaws. A few of these are due to FE being from the 70's. Required combat for instance. The odd terrain rules are not necessarily good. The paratroop allowance is dubious in case of the Allies, and outright silly in terms of the Germans. Nevertheless, it is one of the games I will still play with ease. The rules are easily digestible. With some home rules, it is an excellent game for gamers.

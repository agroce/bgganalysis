Absolutely beautiful game! The map and counter artwork are stunning and the quality of the map and counters is second to none.

As for the game, I love everything about it! Very immersive play, yet it is easy to learn, especially if you are familiar with how war games generally work. There are some great expansions for it and more are in the works.

RATING: 7
Conflict of Heroes bridges the gap between Memoir '44 and Combat Commander in terms of complexity and vaguely historical realism--or perhaps realistic historical-ism? 

The standard 2-player game feels a little sterile to me, with the individual units exhausting their action points one at a time. The game really shines when played solitaire using the solo expansion.

I wish the game were a little more complex, with more going on regarding morale and a few other things. I also wish armor felt more unique as opposed to being the same as infantry except faster and with bigger numbers.

It's just so damn... bland. Not once did I ever feel like I was "in the shit"... I was just moving cardboard around and rolling dice. The game produces absolutely zero narrative or emotion. I don't get why people like the solo expansion either, it was SO easy to outmaneuver the extremely predictable AI cards. Never came close to losing. Bad. No more war games for me.

This is my top war-game, it is beautiful to look at, great 3D terrain effects, counters are big and the font is large and very legible, you can get progressively into the game, low complexity scenarios are equally satisfactory and massively re-playable, the rulebook is absolutely the best I have ever read, the system is rich but very streamlined and smooth, this is probably one of my top 3 games.

1st play: Wargames are not my thing, so take my thoughts accordingly. This game is one step more than Memoir '44 and I enjoyed it more than I expected to. The game I played was nail bitingly close, and the flavor of the units came through. There weren't too many modifiers to bog the game down. It didn't play as fast nor as smooth as memoir, but I like the activation system better. I will have to check out the team play rules, this game could be a contender.

2nd play: This is a special "For a Wargame" rating.  The second time we played with variable action points, bonus cards and grouped commands.  The theme comes through and the way hits are handled combined with the variable action points adds enough mystery and storyline that I enjoyed myself throughout the game.  I don't know if a "wargame 8" is the same as a normal 8, but I liked this game quite a bit.  I would consider acquiring it, but the only person I'd likely play it with is the guy who owns it, so it's on the short list.

I'm not usually fond of war-type games, but this one was a lot of fun. I made a huge mistake my first turn (as the germans) and regretted it the whole game because after that, my fate was sealed. I also don't like games where dice determine the outcome with little influence from much else. I do like that they offer you CAPs so you have a little bit of control and I like that the CAPs go away for each unit killed. I thought that was an interesting concept. I may give this game a hire rating after my second and third play though.

Great wargame. It is the only wargame in my collection currently.

I would not call myself a wargamer, but I'm sure I would enjoy quite a few of them.

This is definitely right up my alley, I have yet to play some of the more complex scenarios as this does not get back to back plays that often and I need to refresh the rules with a lighter scenario.

The rulebook is well structured, the gameplay is engaging. Scenarios are interesting and different enough.

i'm quite new in gaming business, but this game is so far the most fascinating and overwhelming I've encountered. simply beautiful, TENSE, and playing feels like creating a story! waiting for new titles coming out..!

Edit: After some years and maybe 30 games later, it still shines. Beautiful game, very thematic! Love it. Sometimes getting a little annoyed by the dice roll. It can determine the winner in some cases, but definetly strategy is the key.

The Conflict of Heroes system of squad level tactical war gaming has got to be one of the, if not THE best, if you are looking for no more than medium weight. The material feels very historical, very well play tested, and still lots of fun. Combined with their solo AI system and mission generator, which I hope they do for all the theaters, it will be one to stay around for good in my collection.

11/23/13: Comments from the previous version.

Very accessible, large pieces, hard mounted boards and great graphics.  I need to play more than once to learn the subtleties of the pieces.   The # of action points to fire various pieces was counter-intuitive, a lower number is better unlike the other numbers.  It's a fun quick high intensity firefight without a lot of maneuvering.  I've only played to scenario 2 and maybe when you get to the vehicles maneuvering becomes more important.

My friend who hates ASL because of the complexity loves this game.  If you aren't experienced, the defenders seem to have an advantage.  Need to get better at rushing defensive positions.  

Looking forward to getting more plays.

RATING: 10
The Conflict of Heroes series of games has been recognized as a one of the best in the industry.  Not only is this a fine war game but stands as a historical game as well.  Uwe Eickert, the designer of this game, has created an engine which redefines the genre of historical war game and the continuation of this series shows the strong roots which it has in the gaming community.  Conflict of Heroes: Awakening the Bear, is the first in the series and it showcases Operation Barbarossa and it’s belligerents: Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union.  The game is aided by a firefight book which has sixteen of these scenarios each more challenging than the last.  What is realized when playing this game is the in depth nature of historical details along with the combat engine which makes this game shine.
	The first thing which should be mentioned is the quality of the components of the game.  The first thing I noticed was the large counters which were used for the units of combat and the obstacles which could come into play.  I’ve had to play many war games whose counters were so small that I needed a magnifying glass to see the numbers on the unit.  Here, in Conflict of Heroes, the counters are large enough that the numbers are quite easy to read and easy to move.  This change in the size of the counters was already a large improvement on the genre.  The next was the game boards.  They are gorgeously filled with terrain details and buildings giving the “above the battlefield” view a gamer always want from their game board.  It should be noted that one of the greatest strengths of the boards is the lack of fold marks when you open the board.  Because of this, the game boards will last quite some time instead of other games whose boards show signs of wear after time.  Lastly, the game comes with a deck of cards which can help to modify the game adding more historical theme to the game.  All in all, the components of the game are fantastic and should be noticed as some of the finest components in a war game in a long time.  
	As I played through the firefights, I noticed one thing above other war games which are scenario based.  While other scenario based war games allow time for a certain objective to be held, Awakening the Bear has timed scenarios and objectives.  Not only do the players have to obtain the objective, but they have to hold it as well until the end of the firefight.  The timing gives a strained sense of worry throughout the game.  Also, one of the more interesting parts of the combat system, was the casualty markers of the unit.  There is a stack of counters which have modifiers of a unit when hit by the enemy.  When they are drawn, the counter can tell the player how the unit has been wounded, whether it be an immediate killed in action tile, or a unit can be suppressed.  These tiles also give the game even more historical feeling as the game moves on.  As the game continues through rounds, there are reinforcements which may come into play.  On top of all of the gameplay, there is a great amount of flavor text at the beginning of each of the firefights to give the players some historical context as to the scenario in World War II.  The first page of the firefight book is even a full description of what the plans and history were behind Operation Barbarossa.
	Conflict of Heroes: Awakening the Bear is an excellent game of World War II combat and is highly recommended to anyone interested in war gaming.  For someone who enjoys Civil War gaming, I found myself returning to this game again and again even playing through the firefight book numerous times trying different strategies every time.  Uwe Eickert should be praised for the game he has brought to the public.  Knowing there are many more installments of the Conflict of Heroes series, I know that the same quality of gaming is extended into those games as well.  This is an incredible game which should be on the shelf of every war gamer.

RATING: 9.9
Updated once again. I played this game and its solo expansion well over 120 times now.


Once in a while a game comes along that grabs you by the balls. I know everyone has this moment a few times in our life.

To me in wargaming that was with Ambush back in the mid 80's, it was a solo game of WW2 squad based combat. An equally epic smooth playing wargame was The Russian Campaign. These games will be forever on my mental hard disk.

Now enters the incredible Conflict of Heroes Awakening the Bear... PLUS the solo expansion for it.

Nothing in solo land comes even close in this combo. Nothing in 40 years. The only thing to know is that the new (launched in 2015) solo expansion for this game makes it an incredible experience: it is as if you play against a real opponent, anytime, any place ... and it beats you ...

But ... and that's important too: this basic CoH Awakening the Bear 2 -4 players is dynamite with the cards from that solo expansion ! No longer you need to play with the variable or fixed Activation points (AP) system, but you let the cards decide if you get spend or not. This made the game stellar in competitive play too and a real nail biter....

There is only one problem with CoH. It is not from GMT or MMP, it is published by a great company but not perse a "wargaming" company and so the frantic supporters of both ASL and Combat Commander etc .... will try to promote their systems of 20 expansions and 100 page rule books.

But there is no denying: in both competitive play and pure solo gaming there is nothing coming close to the experience you will get in wargaming land with this CoH system.

--------

While the rules are a fraction of other wargames with an absolute stellar index. And the solo expansion was co- created by John Butterfield, yep the man behind Ambush and the recent DDay series... But CoH is so much easier to play, from tanks to infantry to these awesome Flak 88 Guns. All packaged into a very EASY game play.

Everyone should own a copy really.  Your collection is in dire need of such innovative AI or tension.

Important remark: thanks to a great BGG member, you don't even need the Cards from the solo expansion to play this game 2-4 players now. There is a file that lets you create the variable numbers of AP's spend by pulling tokens with the numbers on it. Great job.

for a WWII theme this game is okay, plenty of strategy and varieties (plenty of scenarios & missions), but the setup time can be long and sometimes dice rolls can lead to "what the heck just happened" moments. For example, my German machine gun got killed by a Soviet soldier in one roll

Impresson from first play: great fun, nice components, beautiful, functional map. I originally overlooked this game a bit, worrying if it was enough of a step up on Memoir '44. Now having played it, with more to come, I would say yes, it is a very worthwhile step up from Memoir, there is a fair bit of air between them.

It felt more realistic to me, while still being quite straight forward. Memoir I think will always have its place with the simple, quick play and cool minis. For me CoH promises to be the nice medium weight goto midweek solo wargame I was hoping it might be. Initial score of 8, likely to rise, I would think.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Preliminary rating based on 3 solo plays of firefights 1-3.

So far, a big EH??  I join the minority of reviewers in being underwhelmed, and wondering over all the hoopla/hype generated by this game. 

Components are good quality, physically BIG, and solid artistically, but nothing outstanding.  Good art, somewhat dark boards.  The player aids could have been tricked out in much more evocative fashion, with WWII Russ and Ger colorings, but are instead a set of 4 generics with unrelated color schemes.

The bigger disappointement is game play.  I really, really wanted to get something to fill the hole of and be a 21st century Panzerblitz/Panzer Leader, and was expecting/would have been fine with a lighter, or even much lighter, quicker treatment.  Alas, I concur with several other earlier commenters.  The push for interactivity went way too far.  Instead of a fluid give and take as platoons maneuver against each other, more often than not, it's 1v1 herky-jerk unit vs unit duels.  The group activation/movement mechanic mitigates this somewhat, but not enough.  And the group fire mechanic, wherein another 6-10 rifles or LMGs firing with your "active" unit adds just 1 more drm to the firing, seems like a big False Choice.  And after 3 games, I had an unwelcome epiphany over the undeniable sense of just "too much marker movement vs. game getting played."  A unit gets to move 7 SAP, unopposed -- you end up moving its AP marker 4-7 times, depending on terrain.  Ger move 1, move an AP marker; Rus move 1, move a marker; Fire, move a marker -- fire again, move your AP marker, add a CAP marker movement to cover the difference.  Average 1-1.5 marker moves per unit action.  Really?  In a 5 unit a side scenario?  Gawww, that's an awful lot of admin for each little unit piddle... 

Group activations and Shared activations also give rise to high possibility of confusion as to WHICH was the "lead" active unit.  Unfortunately, no "Active Unit" markers have been provided to designate the lead in, say, a group of 4 movers.  I coined some myself, but this seems a component oversight.  

The use of CAPS for CAP activation to prevent bull-rushing and gang up fire on Spent units works -- about once a round.  Unfortunately, I seem to find opportunities arising for both sides to jump spent units about 5-6 times every round.  It seems gamey, unfair, unrealistic; it IS very common, and why would the opposing side pass up the chance?  

In this regard, I recall a comment made about Hold the Line activation mechanics, citing that the players are strait-jacketed by the system, which gives great incentive to perform actions that have nothing to do with an overall strategy, simply because they are available and easier to do, while more macro moves to enact a higher level strategy are virtually impossible to achieve given the movement/activation limitations.  Here, "jump the spent unit" is always an enticing default approach, because it's easy to get away with, and the system does not seem to offer an attractive alternatives to NOT doing it.    

I certainly will play it more, and wait for the clouds to part, and hope the shining COH radiance will at last bathe me too, as it has appeared to have done to hundreds of gushing reviewers (many apparantly novice to newbies to actual wargames).  But I won't hold my breath, and will start looking at coining house rules...

RATING: 10
Perfect components. Nervewracking, smooth and elegant gameplay, and a very good mix of scenario types and sizes.
The COH system is brilliant and truly the classic example of a easy to learn but hard to master ruleset - I have played well over 50 games of the series and everytime I feel I have learned a new trick or two. I now play it regularly with a friend and every time we finish a game we cant wait to start the next one!

One problem remains with the series however and that is long playtime for anything but the smallest scenarios.

Another gripe (for me-not my friend) is that compared to the Band of Brothers series this one is less realistic feeling and requires players to think more in "game terms" (AP and CAP optimizing) and less in "historial/roleplaying terms"
But as a GAME CoH is superior as it delivers a lot of tension and clever depth, so my choice of game depends on my mood.

Update: After playing the CoH Solo system I have begun using the spent-check system from the solo system in face to face games as well and its FREAKING AWESOME!
It makes CoH an even better and even more tense game and makes it feel far more realistic as well.
I cant recommend it enough!

I feel this is the right mixture of a war game. Not too much tactical and enough action left. The fight modus is sometimes mean due to dice rolling, but I like the very different missions it offers.

Absolutely gorgeous game maps, it doesn't feel like your playing on a hexagonal board, the scenery blends in perfectly.  The game mechanic allows for realistic flanking maneuvers and quick, but yet crucial decisions each turn.  The game seems to flow in real-time allowing players to react quickly to new threats.  The tokens are designed well and provide all the info you need to calculate individual firefights, but it leads to a little bit of an abstract feeling for me. If only there was a way to provide all the info from the tokens into miniature form!

My first hex-and-counter game was D-Day at Tarawa which I liked. The system is well done, the AI is brutal...and the rules...well they were my first wargame ruleset.

This one though, Conflict of Heroes, feels like a different league, maybe even a different sport. The Bear is so easy to understand and to learn. It plays very smoothly. There is nothing the rulebook can't explain in seconds.

The components are awesome. The chits are big and sturdy with nice artwork on them. Yes it doesn't have NATO-symbols on it but it works perfectly and it looks great. Also the mounted boards...gorgeous.

I hope the solo rules as well as the solo expansion are the same high quality.

Great game!

This is a [I]very[/I] tentative rating after a learning solo play. Up to this point, my wargaming experience has essentially been Memoir '44, C&C: Ancients, and one play of Combat Commander... all of which are card-driven games. While I like that design generally, it's refreshing to play a game where you have incredible freedom in your movement and action options.

I really want to get this to the table with another player. It's about the most complexity I want in a wargame, but having said that, the very clear rulebook and the gradual layering of complexity with each new scenario also means it's not an insurmountable challenge. I expect the back and forth in this game as each player manages their active unit results in a tense and fun experience.

Update: got a chance to play this with another gamer, and wow, I like this game. I got schooled by someone with a bit more familiarity with wargames, but that only makes me more interested in learning this system. Compared to Tide of iron, Combat Commander, etc. my gaming buddy felt this one is more "chess like" and "euro-y." But for me, these are positive attributes, and I look forward to exploring this game system even more.

Update: ...and two more plays and I'm convinced I made a smart purchase. This is about as complex as I'd like a wargame to be, once I imagine the game with the additional rules gradually layered on with each scenario. No tanks yet, just scenarios #1 and #3 so far.

There's been a couple blowouts, but that doesn't bother me. If things aren't going well, hit the reset button, start over, and see if players can learn from their mistakes.

I am not a fan of tactical level play (prefer operational and strategic levels) and not even a fan of Academy games after all of the mis- and false communication. That being said, this game works for me as a satisfying tactical experience. The AP system for actions can lend some gamey elements at times but works overall. Components are beautiful (especially the maps) and the teach-as-you-go rulebook is very good. So when I have the occasional tactical wargame itch this will be my system.

I got this solely for solitaire play and will rate it based on the solo variant. The components are obviously awesome and I think the boards are really adding to the theme and sense of the game. The rulebook was easy to read and understand even for someone like me who hasn't played a lot of wargames. I like the illustrated examples and I think the historic descriptions in the Firefight book are very well written and highly thematic. I think this would be fantastic for 2 players, unfortunately I have a hard time finding a playing partner for this game. The solo variant in the back of the rulebook isn't that good, luckily I now own the solo expansion which is great fun.

Have only played the first few firefights, but I'm in love with the system, the components, and the rule book.  The first firefight was easy enough to teach my father and play without his having read a thing.  The counters have all the info you need, and the AP system works very well for running a round.  Individual turns within a round can go very fast, indeed, once both players understand their options properly.

I've been impressed with everything about this game, from the letter from its creator on opening the box, to the gorgeous components, to the outstanding programmed rulebook, to the superb, robust gameplay. If the second edition of this game doesn't deserve a 10, then surely nothing on BGG does.

What a superb intro to tactical games. This one might look fairly complex at first, but the rules are well laid out with plenty of examples and a "programmed instruction" structure lets people read a bit of the rules, try out a scenario and then read more rules. It helps greatly to assimilate the rues.
There's a lot to like in here.

This is my favorite hex based war-game. 

It has beautiful components and maps plus ease-to-understand rules.

Just very hard to find people to play.

The second edition allows for solo play. Which is good and hopefully available in April, 2013.

This game has tanks.

Okay, for real, it's a great tactical wargame system with plenty of meat on its bones.  The counters are a ridiculous 1" chunk of solid board that feels like you're moving wooden tiles around.  While you will often feel the sting of bad dice rolls, there's just so much fun to be had without getting to mucked up in rules exceptions as is typical in most wargames.

Plus, this game has tanks.

what a beautifull game. I can't say anything bad about the components. The game is also fun and easy to play. It is not the most realistic squad level game on the market and gamey tactics are possible. Keep this in mind. I do have to say that with decent smart play, most of these gamey tactics can be avoided so they are not as bad as some people make them to be.

Everything seemed good. But then I realised I couldn't possibly gather enough time to master the game and play it solo in good conditions, without needing to get to the manual each time I set it up.

RATING: 10
Ah, the ever controversial topic of which tactical WWII game is best. There are so many great systems available these days that the problem is trying NOT to acquire them all and just focus on one. I think any of us who started wargaming in the 1970s can tell you it was not always like this. They all offer something interesting and most are worth investing in, but I’m at the point where I don’t want to overload myself with systems. And the truth is I don’t have the opponents for much regular play of any system anyway so it doesn’t make sense to invest in more than one. CoH is my choice over Band of Brothers and Combat Commander (in that order).

I was a Squad Leader/ASL player back in the day but ASL eventually burned me out. CoH offers me enough chrome for this type of experience without overloading me with rules. I’m impressed with how much they’ve been able to render with a modicum of pages. The back-and-forth impulse nature of the system provides good tension, all types of units (infantry, guns, vehicles) are represented, and the components can’t be beat. I can’t say enough about the large, easy to read and handle components. I wish other companies would follow suit! 

The basis of the system is individual action points (APs) for units and command action points (CAPs) for the player. Even if a unit is out of/low in APs, you can use CAPs to take actions which makes for excellent resource considerations. To pour it on or conserve? Action cards provide bonuses and free actions but are appropriately tuned such that they’re not annoying, game breaking surprises.

The system has evolved to the point where the strength of the game is really its flexibility. There are different ways to tailor this game to your tastes. Per the base rules, each activated unit (or group) gets 7APs to spend before being spent. However, a popular fog-of-war variant is to play with variable APs whereby players roll dice to see how many APs a unit will receive when activated so you can’t count on anything (especially if you keep them hidden!). 

Not only does the game play well face-to-face, but the solitaire expansion offers a wonderful player vs AI experience. As someone who does not play both sides, this innovation is a godsend. What’s subsequently evolved from the solo expansion is using the AI cards in the f-t-f game. Instead of set or variable APs even, you can use the AI deck to determine if a unit is spent after each and every action it takes. Now there's a push-your-luck aspect to taking actions for a different fog-of-war experience. That makes four different ways to play the action point system -- and they all work.

The weakness of the system (and every system has them, fanboys!) is that spent units can be approached without fear of reprisal. This is somewhat addressed via action cards that players get because you don’t know if your opponent has a “free action” card ready to use. But if out of cards and APs and CAPs, you know a spent unit is vulnerable. There’s no way around this but good players should not leave themselves vulnerable in this way very often. Still, I do see it as the game’s weak point but it’s nothing that torpedoes the game play. All in all, the game play, the system versatility, the state-of-the-art solitaire option, and the outstanding components make this game a 10 for me.

PS On a related note, if you haven’t seen[url=http://battlefieldswarriors.blogspot.co.uk/2014/12/comparing-lower-complexity-tactical.html] this excellent blog on comparing WWII tactical systems, [/url] by all means check it out.

PPS The 2nd edition components, especially the maps, are well worth picking up.

CoH is quite a nice game. It feels like a solid wargame, but keeps things consolidated and compact enough that you don't feel entirely bogged down by rules. As such, it is a fun wargame without being overly heavy or AP-prone. I love that players can be extra reactionary with their turns, as each player takes only one action each turn- so this is no game where one player does all their movement and firing before the second player. Incremental build-up creates lots of tension and wide room for tactics and strategy.

When I first stepped out of the Memoir 44 kiddie pool and looked into squad based wargames, I played around with Band of Brothers for awhile. I still find that game enjoyable but it's often difficult to motivate myself to bring it to the table since the rules are just unfamiliar enough to present a speed bump between me and the game every time I decide to play it again.

This isn't a problem with the Conflict of Heroes system which is much more intuitive for me and allows for very satisfying tactical depth and variety.  I do miss the real concept of op fire and ZOC in this one, but I'm ok with the quasi versions of these concepts in this system.

We've played up through Firefight 3 and I'm looking forward to moving on to terrain effects and vehicles. These early firefights seem to involve a lot of maneuvering but not enough conflict for my taste.

At first I told my brother that this was a mistake buy, but it does such a good level of feeling connected to each unit. That now each time a unit dies I put my head down in frustration and feel the loss of each unit. Whether that is tanks dieing to invisible AT riflemen or running my infantry onto half-tracks.

First taste at tactical and I am enjoying it. Despite that I place it below strategic and operational.

I found the game to be uninteresting at first, the initial scenarios are pretty much a couple of squads of infantry taking pot shots at each other in generic "TAKE THE HILL BOYS" type scenarios. Once you get the game up and running with vehicles and the full rule set it's an absolute blast. One of the few wargames I own that doesn't make some of the gamers I know bolt for the door as soon as they see it's hex and counter.

Breaks my heart, but although it strayed were no wargame strayed before, some of it's mechanics are.. stupid.
Foremost the fact that if an opponent has no cards or CPs left & his unit is spent you can walk up to it and kill it. That is so fucking stupid. But to be honest atm there isn't anything better out.. neither BoB or other mid-weight squad level war games.

_______________________________________
The not so good communication of the designer about release dates and such & the lack of support concerning new scenarios/replayability (you basically have to make up a lot of stuff on your own) let it drop down to 9.. but still a very good game.

________________________________________
I have waited for a game like this for a long time.
I love the combined forces squad level scope & the rich tactics you can apply.
But what is revolutionary about this game is it's system.. with it, it accomplishes a constant tenseness & involvement of all participating players, because of the simultaneous play & the various activation possibilities it is a constant back-and-forth.. a probing, stalling & then a full blown commitment to attack.. so far no other game i know of has accomplished that.

Add to that the hidden movement system, the (for you) unknown damage you brought on your foe & the optional hidden Action Point dice roll.. hence a feeling of uncertainty looms over the battlefield and what feeling could be better suited for a wargame. :)

The only one change i would want, is a customizable map-tile system combined with a point-cost-system for the units, because although the maps are stunningly beautiful, i want the possibility to create my own battles with "unfair" terrain features.
But i will be creating those on my own for now.

It never quite clicked for me, I'm not sure why. The scale seemed a bit off (facing for infantry?); the scenarios (played six or seven) weren't very interesting. The impulse system is a good one (as demonstrated by ATS) but there's not enough flexibility here to make it really work, as regards overwatch fire and so on. It felt like a wargame for people that aren't really interested in wargames: that's fine, but it's not what I want for WWII tactical.
Also, I was annoyed by my counters and rules being obsolete as soon as I bought the game, and not compatible with any future games in the series; the experience put me off the publisher in general.
When I bought it, I chose this over Combat Commander. Bad decision.

I don't have many wargames in my collection yet and this is a perfect way to get into that genre.  The rules are pretty easy to learn and the gameplay is smooth.  I like how one unit is activated and can take multiple moves over many turns rather than take one or a set of moves at once and then fatigue.  I also like how the damage is random.  Other wargames I've played involved a basic "kill or stun" mechanism and this game introduces a large variety of affects that can affect movement/defense/attack all in different combinations.  The board is stunning and the chits are thick, high quality, and also have good artwork.  My concerns of this game so far is that there appears to be a small balance issue with the first few fire fights.  Regardless, I've played the side which I feel is at a significant disadvantage and I still feel like I am having a great time.  This will see the table many more times.

The rules are simple, there are numerous scenarios (16 total), and there is hardly any downtime.

Plusses:
-Rules are easy and fun to read, easy to teach.
-Production quality is great, those maps are gorg.
-CAPS and cards are good toys that vary gameplay, and break the game out of a chess-like grip.

Some downsides to this game:
-Not the best simulation of infantry tactics or Command and Control. Granted, no boardgame really is. But, the game doesn't feel very much like I'm commanding actual soldiers, so immersion is a little low. 
-I'm not too fond of the way it handles tanks - which move and fire very much like infantry do. It feels >too< simple. Now, this game is trying to be simple. But this exacerbates the first point, which is that the immersion is gone.
-Two hits to kill is a bad rule for both a good game and a good wargame. Game quickly becomes potshots, since irrespective of that first hit ("Unnerved", even), the second hit will without fail destroy the unit.
-Although this game is easy to learn, I'm not convinced it's much easier to teach than Combat Commander. Maybe it's fair to say that CoH plays faster

But, at the flip side, the game is fun, beautiful, and easy to learn and play. I've already played it with a few of my friends.

Some new counters for the upcoming solo module by John Butterfield.

The game system rocks. I am kind of believing deeply that Conflict of Heroes had hit the "sweet spot" of balance between Advanced Squad Leader and Lock 'n Load. To take a comparison, the fiddle in some parts of the tactical rules of Lock 'n Load had been tightened up while the rigidity in Advanced Squad Leader sequence of play had been streamlined to be much more interactive - the orders given by you, the squad leader, would be responded by your men and guns much quicker as if your voice had been heard just next to them or via wireless radios loud and clear. In other word, you presence are felt, and you would have thought you were really been there. Both sides can edge out each other by any chance in tightly designed secnarios, just like in the real tactical situation where the larger operational picture doesn't matter. I love the tactical feel absolutely!

Simple tactical game with infantry and tanks. The art is superb and the scenarios are well thought. I don't mark it an 8 because I find the game play a little lacking compared to other games. I more or less enjoy playing it but not enough so I am actively seeking to play it. The Solo expansion is an 8 for me because I find it much better.

I keep this game because it is simple enough so I can play it with my 6 year old. As I don't like much the AP system I prefer to roll dice using the Solitary system to check if a unit is expended or not based on the action points spent and the result of the dice. Rolling doubles always saves the units. Otherwise check the colored dice result and compare it with the AP. If it is equal or higher, it is spent.

This way even actions like rallying or digging a hole can keep the unit active (rolling doubles) and you can jump from one unit to another unit doing actions, without doing all the actions with one unit and then going to another one, which I don't like much. But, of course, you can always roll a 1 doing a single movement and your unit is pinned. Well, of course you save some CAP for that, didn't you?

Initial score of 8 after 4 learning missions.  Still learning all of the mechanics but feels like this is the tactical war game for me. Very dynamic and will probably rise in rating. 

Should admit that my only previous tactical war game experience is Command & Colors: Ancients, Battle Lore and Night of Man. 

Plan on learning Combat Commander: Europe still. But the rest of them may be out the door.

**UPDATED SCORE to 8.5**

This is a terrific tactical game.  With the Solo AP system in place for 2P games, it flies and sings.  Only down side, is now that I have a taste for competition, the solo game, despite the EXCELLENT AI, is a bit lonely...

Aunque fácil de aprender, para nada es simple. Tiene toda la simulación que quería para un wargame,pero con un tiempo de partida ajustado y la diversión que puede ofrecer un juego mas ligero. Digno de mención el acabado artístico de los tableros, una autentica delicia de detalles, de 10!

Excellent tactical-level WWII game with focus on Operation Barbarosa.  Love the quick game play.  Not too heavy (ASL) and not too lite (Memoir 44)--Just right for a mid-lifer with a full-time job and kids.  Instruction book isn't too daunting and certainly not '80's AH thickness--ain't nobody got time for that!

It is a great game stricto sensu, really well made, well conceived , deep and complex.

This game seems to have a very nice feel for what I think WW2 east front fighting might have been like.  The game sets up very quickly, plays quickly, yet requires quite deep thinking.  I will definitely buy the solo version and scenario generator when I get the chance.

Edit: I have tried the solo version and it's very good. It takes a little bit to get used to how it changes some of the base game mechanics but I think it works very well. I see that John Butterfield was involved in this design.  He does have a knack for making great solo games.

I love this game, because there are so many different strategies you can try out to hammer down your opponent, it has a great replayability factor. When I did the German translation for them I got fascinated by the extraordinary level of historical background they provided with the game. The many different scenarios are well introduced and playing them is even more fun if you have read the historical background for it. This is definitely one of my favorites!

RATING: 8
This tactical system is great for those who like their games to include puzzly elements. The puzzles to be figured out here may not necessarily have that much to do with real military tactics (for example, how to get your opponent to 'spend' his key MG unit so that you can rush it unopposed), but they're engaging nonetheless.
All in all, for a tactical game it's pretty thinky, and the components are very nice to look at whilst you and your opponent do all that thinking. That's not to say it's a slow game - it isn't, it's fast. Unless someone is extremely prone to AP.

If I was just rating the base game, this would be an 8. The excellent solo AI expansion though bumps it up to a 9 for me. It is really a neat system and one I am looking forward to playing through more. The system as a whole hits the right mix of complexity and accessibility for me.

RATING: 9
What a great game!  Not overly complex, but has some really innovative mechanics.  The use of the Action Points and Command Action Points lets the players break out of the "IGO-UGO" sequence.  Movement, firing and rallying all cost Action Points but the opposing player gets to react to actions, so the game allows things to happen almost simultaneously.  Also, you can use some of your precious Command Action Points (that reflect the leadership quality of the German officers/NCOs compared to the Russians) to allow units to do extra actions.

Another clever game mechanism is the use of "hit result" counters that you pull randomly on a hit result.  There is only one "Kill" result. Other hits affect movement, firing and morale; two of these hits equals a kill.  Since you are not using a matrix (Combat Results Table) with fixed results, the likelihood of units to be killed increases as the combat gets more intense since there is a limited number of chits (increased chance of getting that "KILL" chit) or units get double hits.

The physical presentation of the game is quite appealing, too.  The counters are thick and 1-inch square.  The maps are mounted and the art work is nice.

On top of that, Uwe is a nice guy that takes the time to answer his mail when a customer has a problem (my copy came with Spanish-language hit results counters).

Awaiting delivery of game, slated for mid June'16 after Academy Games finishes another printing run. Just got this version today(6-16-06) Opened it and compared it to first edition(I thought first edition was excellent, this blows it out of the water. The maps are hands down the best I've ever seen). Minor rules changes and enhancements as well as small changes to the firefight scenarios, as well as added firefights. Also came with Wrecks and Destruction counter expansion. I really like the counter tray and lid that helps keep all the counters organized. Nice rounded edge dice, great graphics on counters and cards. My only critique is that some of the counter sheets were not cut through all the way and a few of my counters suffered small tears during the punching out process, no matter how careful I was. I will be contacting Academy Games' customer service.

Highly competitive game that creates a great narrative without a lot of rules overhead. Second Edition is a big step forward in graphics and production value, which is saying a lot considering the quality of the First Edition.

WWII tactical is a crowded niche. As a system, it's well behind CC for me in general, but probably noses out LnL as a combined arms game, at least mechanically.

RATING: 8
Really fun system that can (unfortunately) break down into "gamey situations".  Still, I really like it but I have to not allow myself to take advantage of them.  For instance: I have a machine gun team in woods just out of range, they pop out one hex into range, fire and then pop back into the woods.  Completely legal in the rules but would a machine gun team set up in a tree line move out 50 meters, set back up, engage the target and then move back to the safety of the woods?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Poor scenario selection for newbies.  The first Firefight is unbalanced unless you are not a newbie and know how to strategize the weaker side.

Also, the base game needs more Firefights (and, yes, I'm aware of the Firefight Generator, but that's a different product).

Game engine and graphics take many complex rules and make them transparent to players. The Action Point/Command Action Point heart of the game accounts for so many issues (like command & control or rate of fire) in a manner that removes the technical overhead to play and allows players to focus on being commanders. Maybe the best tactical WW2 game on the market.

I have a love-hate relationship with Conflict of Heroes.

===

Honestly, I like Combat Commander much more as a game. (And it comes with a fantastic random scenario generate built in, whereas it took CoH years to get a separately purchasable firefight generator.)

But Conflict of Heroes now has the Solitaire expansion, which interests me.

===

I like the excellent Combat Command rulebook, and short clear FAQ/errata.

In contrast Conflict of Heroes keeps cycling through rulebook versions with significant rule changes and occasional answers in the many rule forum threads which are all hard to keep up with. There are known errors in the rulebook which remain uncorrect in various versions for years. Argh. They are terrible at version management and communication.

===

I like the clean clear unambiguous maps in Combat Commander (in the SPI / Redmond Simonsen tradition).

In contrast Conflict of Heroes has the (currently trendy) "photorealistic" looking artistic maps which are full of confusing murky ambiguities. What kind of terrain is this hex? Is there line of sight between these hexes? Etc. A triumph of "pretty" over "functional" Argh.

===

Many people praise the thick chunky counters of Conflict of Heroes, but I'm indifferent to that. The price you pay is a bigger box and fewer counters.

===

Facing for not only vehicles but also for infantry in CoH is a bit fiddly for me. I prefer not having to deal with counter facing; in many WW2 tactical games, infantry facing is irrelevant.

===

But all that said, I've had a lot of fun with the Solo expansion, which is the reason I bought the base game. For 2-player play, CoH is OK but I think CC is better.

RATING: 9
FUN ★★★★★
This is a wargame that doesn't need dozens of pages of rules and exceptions, so that we can just setup the battle, figure out the way to win, and play. Simple and effective. Rules are made to render the conflict without being a burden for the players. Close to perfect.

RULES ★★★★✰
Rules are very well written, progressive, easy to find. Scenarios (firefights) are clear and easy to follow.

IMMERSION ★★★★★
The historicity of the units is high: firepowers, fire rates, defense abilities (and so on) are very well rendered - with simple rules. I can remember moves and shots days after I played them, this is a exactly what I expect from a game with high immersion.

DEPTH ★★★★✰
There should be much more addons, maps, scenarios. conflicts. This so-well designed game deserves more of them, for instance western European front, North Africa, snow combats, Normandy, battle on the Rhine, and so on. I cannot understand why after so many years the system hasn't been expanded to several other theaters, even though there is one in the jungle of the Pacific. We just need some new counters ... and maps!

I found the alternate activation a bit tedious, too easy to counter making any form of surprise difficult. It also makes co-ordinating attacks all but impossible. I think that the Russians are badly under rated, particularly the MGs. Great quality components, but the system just didn't click with me.

RATING: 6
+ Simple but rewarding gameplay
+ Good variation in the scenario design
+ Hidden units and concealed hit markers add to battlefield uncertainty
+ Excellent rulebook
+ Amazing artwork

Update: downrated after 14 plays
- Allows for and even supports gamey tactics, like
--- the scenario defender passes while the attacker has to stall, so the defender always has the advantage
--- wait for the enemy to spend his units, then leave cover and high knee skip into open ground unharmed
--- run in circles around a tank to make it spend all command points
- Many scenarios are unbalanced (especially the last ones)
- Russian units having a higher firing cost than german units (firing once vs. firing twice) leads to imbalance
- Some of the cards are vastly inferior compared to the rest (like Rally Up! or Experienced Sergeant)
- Some powerful cards can decide the outcome of a scenario (like Command Action)
- Due to all the factors mentioned above, the game is extremely luck-based

Do yourself a favor and buy Combat Commander instead - a much better war game.

After playing several games of this I'm ready to give it a '9'. Still does not quite match the narrative excitement and emotional attachment of Combat Commander, but far easier to get a game up and going. Unlike CC, where I have to basically re-read the entire rulebook from scratch if I go a few months without playing.

Can be bad for you if you are unlucky very early and your opponent isn't generous enough to return the favor. But in a game like this I care more about fun than absolute fairness.

RATING: 7
Played a friend's copy. Rating based on one scenario.

I totally get if you are into wargaming this is a great, great game. We barely touched the rules (fighting a small skirmishing scenario using only foot units) but it felt really tactical, using terrain to your advantage to circle the enemy and 'hunting him down' to force close combat in a thematic way. I like the fact that both the way units move as well as the victory points allow it to be tied in to real historic events. The gameplay feels very streamlined and easy flowing.

I happen to like 'high fantasy', so Battlelore will remain my option of choice as far as (light) wargaming concerns, but this is a game that is already a notch up to 'real' wargaming. It definitely crosses that line of 'fiction' into 'real' simulation like, without losing it in incomprehensible and or unreadable rulebooks.

What I dislike is the quality of wargames. Though this one has decent counters, it is still that: counters. And not even plastified, as we noted when I accidentily spilled tea all over his copy pre-game. They warped within 2 seconds and even though we quickly mopped everything up and set it up so there will (hopefully) barely be long time damage, the 'condensed cardboard' quality doesn't hold up to the quality I'm used to in Euro and other modern games. We noted that - if the spilling wouldn't have happened - it is good that the counters are thick as you are picking them up to show that units have acted and that would be a real pain with thin counters. All the other components are functional, but nowhere near anything I would deem 'good'.

Secondly, as with all wargames, units possess 12 stats, using front/flank defense, unarmored/armored attack (colored to show close-combat exceptions), a movement rate, a range rate, a rate of fire rate tying into the action point system, a symbol, sequence number, name and picture. All in all 12 stats besides name and picture to worry about.

I get that that is not a lot for a wargame perspective and that you need some of those to allow for realistic simulation, but to me this is what has held me back from wargaming all those time. This one is no exception.

Please note, all the dislikes are about traits all wargames possess (and this one less so than many of its counterparts). The game itself is rock solid. If you are into wargaming, revise my rating by 2 points upwards.

I'm not, so for me it is 'ok to play'. Won't mind playing another scenario, but won't seek it out either.

A beautiful game with strategic depth and rewarding tactical decisions across a number of diverse and engaging scenarios. If you're into historical war games, CoH is a rewarding experience. If you're into games as systems of rules to be explored, CoH is a well-designed and interesting system.

However, as stellar as the game may be, if your buddies are into fielding armies of orcs or the undead and high body counts, CoH probably won't change their preferences. So, if you can find a dedicated gamer who is interested in the theme and will work through the scenarios, I think CoH should be high on your list. But, if you're not sure you have a friend who is along for the ride, your mileage may vary.

Tried this game a few times over the years. It seemed really interesting, but I find it a bit boring. It lacks an element of excitement for me. Move one hex, opponent move one hex. Move one hex, opponent move one hex. Shoot at enemy unit, miss. Enemy unit shoot back, miss. Shoot again, enemy shoot again. Those two units don't have any action points left, so they are turned on their used side. Repeat the same process for the next unit. 

I get what they were going for with this system, but to me it doesn't feel like war. It feels like a series of duels between two units, one at a time.

My third foray into wargames is Conflict of Heroes: Awakening the Bear! (second edition).  Of the three war-games I've played, this one certainly has the best rule book (perhaps this is related to it being the 2nd edition?) and although there are a lot of elements, this system is logical, albeit a bit more abstracted than my favorite war game (Ambush!). 

Criticisms are small and for the tiles, which oddly have the directional arrow of the vehicle/infantry pointing skyward rather than the direction that the vehicle/infantry is facing/pointing their weapons. (The directionality of fire is an otherwise great mechanic of this game.) Also, why is the flank defense listed above/before the front defense? Other than these two counterintuitive decisions, the system is logical, the counters are good, the map is great and the game play is swift, though requires strategy and foresight.

Although Awakening the Bear! lacks the narrative development, characterization and immersive vividness of Ambush! and Thunderbolt Apache Leader, the physical elements of the game are very good, and it would be possible to teach somebody how to play this in a relatively short time. An enjoyable, solid system that trades the immersive qualities of heavier wargames for ease of use and faster action, and for these reasons will remain in my collection.

This is the solo-able edition.  
I have a feeling that the free pnp of Valor & Victory does all this game does, and better.

I got this for the solo play when there was a sale at an OLGS, and I really like the production and my first play. A bit harder to grasp the rules thannI would have liked, but will get better with mire plays. Unsure if this or Night if Man is my preference, but definitely a contender.

This is quite simply the prettiest and best tactical wargame I've played. (though I admit I haven't played that many)

The second edition greatly improved the components and even the game a bit with rule changes here and there.

The game is still missing a campaign mode, scenarios where players pick their forces (there is only one and even there only one of the players chooses his/her fortifications and not the units as well - and it's still tremendous fun) and still has some unintuitive and unbalanced minor rules.

All in all, it's a great system that makes you dream about its future.

Just a fanatastic game system! Love the mechanics and that it's a back and forth fast paced game. I just want something based on the western front already!!!

(Reviewing the solo expansion too:) It is probably the best, most precise simulation game I've ever played... It is my first real "wargame". It's so much fun. Each mission feels really different and the AI does a really convincing job.

[COLOR=#FFFFFF][BGCOLOR=#000000]1P[/BGCOLOR][/COLOR] [COLOR=#FFFFFF][BGCOLOR=#009900]2P[/BGCOLOR][/COLOR] This is one of my favorite two player platoon level tactical wargames. The game is just top notch. I love the combat system. It comes with stellar boards and counters, and a great programmed rulebook.

This is an excellent war game. I've played through the first three or four firefights now 2-player and I love it. It's always tense, though in my experience seems to be harder for the Germans for some reason.

Need to play this or ship it off soon. Lovely to look at, but increasingly skeptical about how many interesting decisions there really are. And the rules overhead is higher than it feels it should be.

Great update. I go you go action system is easy to teach and learn. Battles are luck dependent, with gaining double hits  driving play over complex strategy. Gets better with larger scenarios, but group rules take a while to learn.

Sold the first edition and then caved and picked up the second--and I have to grudgingly admit that it was worth it.  The solo expansion and mission generator are fantastic.  Production values are top-notch; I really appreciate the 2nd edition storage solution.  Otherwise, the game plays even better than the 1st, is better imbeded in its historical context, and remains exciting and tense.  A pity it remains difficult to find opponents... but I guess that's what the solo expansion is for.

The entire Conflict of Heroes series is fantastic, and this may still be the pinnacle. The system features some clever eurogame influences, a tense and highly engaging back-and-forth activation system. Academy Games is known for publishing games with outstanding components, and that definitely rings true here. The counters are 1 inch large, printed on thick, full color punchboard. All the map boards are mounted and gorgeous. I'm a huge fan of the tough decisions you face in this fast paced platoon-level wargame where each counter represents an infantry squad, a crewed gun, or an individual vehicle.

It's accessible, attractive and plays quickly. What it lacks in realism, it makes up for in playability. 

The system has taken a while to mature, however, and appears to have stalled under the weight of multiple editions and digital conversions. Another minor issue is that the record-keeping required for tracking hidden unit positions goes against the aforementioned accessibility.

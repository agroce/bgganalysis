Somebody always pulls this out as apparently it is a popular "party game"... :(

Reason for the low score: Maybe it is that I hate to describe things or because I don't like opening up to others during party games like this. I actually managed to get good scores because apparently I can find the lowest common denominator that manages to get my point across and I can deduct what others meant, too, so I actually managed to win it fairly often. I still hate the game, though!

I loathe this horrible game. It brings out the worst in people. Extremely dull in large groups due to long periods of inactivity, in spite of the fact that it's billed as a party game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A game that essentially fences off words that you want to say to get others to say the word you want them to say.  This leads to frustration on the part of the speaker who can't say what he wants to say, and the audience as they have to listen to your suboptimal efforts.  For me, this leads to suboptimal fun.  Like playing baseball where everyone has to tie one hand behind their back. Challenging yes, fun no.

One of the all-time great party games.  Being the gamer that I am, I like to play this scoring variant... Get a card right: +2   Screw up: -2   Pass on a card: -1   It never made sense to me that passing cost you the same as messing up, and now, with the occasional "-1" in the mix, you also lower the chances that the game could end in a tie, though, truth be told, having two balanced teams is a rarity... and it usually doesn't matter, that's how fun this game is.

This game is a fun party game.  The first time I played it, we played one couple vs. another, even though it was their favorite game.  My wife and I had known each other a lot longer, and we trounced them.  We had so much fun, we went through the entire deck over a few hours.

RATING: 7
Fun party game which accommodates a large number of people with a simple rule: every other player is on the same team.  When it's your turn to lead, you have to get your team to guess as many words as possible over a set amount of time by giving clues without using "taboo" words.  Normally not one for giving rules during a game comment, but that's the whole game!  If you think it sounds fun, it probably will be.

All of the components work well together to create a very entertaining game.  I generally prefer party games that require you to act out as opposed to speak, but Taboo works well in this sense because the game requires an incredible amount of creativity and quick planning in the method you tackle the words.  Most importantly, this is just plain fun.

This is one of the better family games that were churned out in the 1980's - but that's not saying much. Like Pictionary, it seems to pick one particular skill which varies in ability in different people and tries to craft a whole game around only the exercise of that skill. It might be fun as a party game for a group at about the same level of skill in thinking on your feet with regard to vocabulary. I'm guessing it's not as much fun for those individuals with less of that skill and potentially a little awkward for groups mixed in that skill (as most are).

I love to play this game with my friends on parties, its so much fun :) Plus I also used this game to enrich my English vocabulary, because honestly, I didn't know most of the words in this game!! So for the first time we played it with our Singaporean friend Leo, we was beaten badly..which means we still need to practise so much more ;)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is a party game in which you need to explain a word to your time – without mentioning the word or any words from a list (for instance, if you need to explain The Statue of Liberty, you cannot use words like freedom, New York, statue, liberty etc). I do like wordpartygames, but it’s always sad when something doesn’t quite work. In this case, disputes can happen very easily when some players claim that they are allowed to use an abbreviation or some other word etc. and the other team disputes this… It hasn’t been a huge issue so far, but what has is the fact that the rules state that you cannot gesticulate. However, most of the players still do this even though I’ve told them a million times, so we kind of skipped that single rule… Fortunately, the game doesn’t become any worse, though personally I think it’s what makes the game even more fun and challenging.

I own a Danish copy which is great; the game is very language dependent especially as you cannot mention a list of words which are printed on the cards, which would be hard for some if they were in a foreign language. It’s a nice party game, but I’ve tried a lot of better one; Telestrations is a lot more fun, and if you want wordgames, Alias is the best in my opinion (and A-Z (or A-Å in Danish) is a good alternative).

I like playing this party game once in a while, but one of the big drawbacks I see with this game is that players who play it often (or have played it recently) may have a huge advantage simply because they've seen some of the cards.  Also, players who know each other tend to be a lot better at picking up each other's clues, so the presence of sets of close friends or couples can make team-selecting a little hairy.

Production: Nice buzzer, with a rather annoying (and therefore fun) sound.  Legible cards that are nothing special, but are numerous.  The travel/starter edition is really compact.

Play: So much fun from such a simple rule set.  I enjoy playing on teams, and having the double pressure of the hourglass and the buzzer.  It's a great challenge to overcome the impulse to incorporate the clues from the card (I'm supposed to describe this word, and oh look, here's a list of five very useful words!).  Leads to very methodical use of synonyms. (3+2+4) (20 plays)

This is a thing that you enjoy with a group of people in the same room about trying to get your partner(s) to speak a particular set of letters...
It's a solid party game with teams, clue giving with difficult restrictions, blurting and guessing.  Our buzzer and hourglass broke long ago, but you don't need a mechanical buzzer and any timing device will work (and better than an hourglass if it beeps).

Taboo is a classic party game and is a lot of fun.  The idea of the game is to try to explain what the word on your card is without using words which are generally related to said word.  It can get challenging and is one of the games where the fun lies in how each team interacts with one another.

I think this game is best for couple's nights and is best played in two rounds: couple vs. couple, then swap partners with your opponent.  Just be careful not to start any arguments based on "compatibility". :)

Fun party game where you give clues to your teammate based on a game card. The card states the clue (eg. &quot;Tom Hanks&quot;) plus a list of words you cannot say (eg. &quot;Apollo 13&quot;, &quot;Forrest Gump&quot;, &quot;Actor&quot;, etc). If you say one of the words on the card, the Taboo words, you opponents score a point. If you get the clue, you get the point. Great game.

This is a game that is a common one at group events where a game is played.  A group event where there is no knowledge of games that are not "Top 40", so to speak.  I'll join in, but it is more a way to pass time in the group than an engaging game.  If it were my choice I would pick something else.

Party game. We play a fun "Movie-in-a-hat" variant. Have everybody start out by writing as many movies as they want on scraps of paper and then mix them all into a hat. Draw and play. Can't say any words in the title (obviously not counting "the", "and", "in", etc). No gestures. 

Eg:
"Harrison Ford and Mark Hamil fight evil in a galaxy far, far away."
"Star Wars"
"No, the second one."
"Uh, Empire Strikes Back."

AMAZING!!! Love this as a party game and with lots of friends but we ran into a BIG problem that detracts from the game. After about 2 or 3 runs through the cards, we kind of memorized them and it became not nearly as fun. We looked at getting the restock for the cards and it was out of stock for 1 and it costs like 45 to 50 dollars which is insane.

[many more than 5 plays] I'm not much of a party gamer in general, but there are some I like, and this is one of my favorites.  It's word-y, fast-paced, anyone can play, and it doesn't require you to make up nonsense.  It's really a game that depends on communication and verbal skills.  I like it a lot and haven't had enough of it yet.

Taboo is a party word game. Players take turns describing a word or phrase on a drawn card to their partner without using five common additional words or phrases also on the card. The opposing partners watch a timer and use a buzzer to stop the game, buzz the player describing if one of the five off limits words or phrases is used, or the describing player makes any gestures. The describing team gets a point for each card they guess successfully and the opposing team gets a point for each card they pass on, make gestures on, or lose for saying one of the off limits words or phrases. An excellent party game!

A great portable game which works for gamers and non-gamers alike, is a good ice-breaker which takes no time to teach, allows people to drop in and out, or to take just a short turn if they're uncomfortable.

Take a couple of dozen cards with you on holiday and leave the rest of the components at home or in the bin, and you have a fantastic quick pre- or post- dinner entertainment without having to wait until the dishes are off the table!

I've also used it in language exchange settings, where one side wants to learn English.

It's impossible to rate board games and party games on the same rating scale! 

I love word-guessing party games because it challenges me to think more laterally even under pressure.

It's just too difficult for most people to do well.

One of those non-games utterly devoid of any kind of meaningful rule. The few rules that are there cannot be enforced and open up utterly pointless discussions (no doubt the "social" aspect). Only gets played whenever someone in the company wants to play something "light", which happens way too often (about once every year). The score reflects the amount of time I have wasted on this rubbish and the self-loathing I harbour for not having stolen it from the owner in order to dump it in the trash ten years ago.

RATING: 7
Older version of Taboo so some of the topics are a bit dated.  ANd in my version, the egg timer is cracked whilst the squeaker lost its squeak almost immediately.  Ah well.

A good party game which relies more on people arbitrating how other players are doing.  Articulate is much more of a simple game and can be played with multiple teams.  That said, Taboo has a much smaller cost and is more intellectually challenging.

My favorite party game. They gave a lot of thought to the scoring, moreso than most party games, so it can actually get competitive. Frantic, in a good way, requiring both creativity and interpretation. The taboo words really make you balance speed with accuracy. The buzzer is fun, and the "using it as an electric razor" joke never gets old. :)

Yearly comment update - no updates to be made.

A light-hearted, loud, fun game - this one is great with family, or late at night when people don't have the mental focus left for something heavier.  It lacks depth and it's rare that we'd bring it out in my game group, but it's fun for a family gathering or other light hearted group.

RATING: 7
(04/02/2015) Comment based on a number of unrecorded plays.

A classic party game combining the speed and tension of Charades and mentally taxing, word-guessing/association fun of Password. Great for large groups of non-gamers and gamers alike, ranging in ages from adolescents and adults.

One player has a card with a word that needs to be guessed by his fellow teammates. However, the card also lists a number of "taboo" words that cannot be used as clues. If a taboo word is used, a player from the other team, who is also monitoring the card, can use an annoying electronic buzzer to signal that the card is disqualified. There is much stress as the clue-giver must think frantically and quickly to give out as many clues and get the password, without using the taboo words. The fun comes from using the electronic buzzer. I used to play this a lot with a large group of friends at "adult" game nights, but this went away when I started playing "modern" board games. It is a solid "7".

I like speedy, quick-thinking games as much as I like deep strategy; the romping around to my deep-stretch yoga. I am VERY good at Taboo and always find it hilarious the words that people choose when trying to get others to say their word. Simple, straight-forward party game; the more the merrier.

Taboo is one of the better party games out there.  It's a classic!  If you know your team members well, you will be very successful, but maybe I also just know the cards too well.

Taboo is essentially Catch Phrase with restrictions on what words can be uttered. It sounds like a fun twist, but what it actually does it force lateral thinking, such as  references to pop culture that your team may or may not get. Whether or not you can use lateral thinking comes down to luck of the draw and how in tune you are with your teammates. So it turns out this restriction makes the game less fun.

Still, there is fun to be add... I attribute that to the base game, Catch Phrase, being so good. So I won't turn down a game of Taboo... but I'd rather play Catch Phrase.

What a great party game, we always have a blast playing Taboo.

You can explain it under 2 minutes and it offers a lot of laughs making it a winner in my book. I prefer Time´s Up over Taboo but I still like the game very much. You NEED the right group to play this but other than that it doesn’t have any more cons. 

A plus is that you can play Taboo with gamers and non-gamers alike.

Try it you won’t regret it.

It’s been a long time since I last played Taboo. I still like the game a lot, but I need to buy the game in Spanish. As its intended target are non-players and/or family players, being in English really hurt the game because many members of my family doesn’t understand English.

I´m also downgrading its rating because my desire to play Taboo isn’t as high as before.

Classic and fun party game. It is not hard to go through all the cards and once you go through them all you need to take a break for a few months before you can play with the same group - since the clues can be recycled. Thus, while you can replay Taboo after taking a break continuous replay-ability is lacking.

This is as good a party game as any. If you know people who "share a brain" seperate them onto different teams.  Why?  Because they'll come up with clues like "When we were in Arizona on that trip last year, what we had for breakfast" "Tacos!" which I think totally ruins the game.  Good fun, buy it and play it.

Ok, as far as party games go I might have a bias due to growing up with taboo and having fond memories of it. But it's a really good game.

25 words or less and Time's Up: Title Recall probably edge out Taboo for me, but Taboo scales and fits a larger group and a more relax atmosphere than these other games do.

My favorite party game, and my favorite word game.  It's fun with people who have different verbal communication skills, trying to give them good clues or brainstorm what they want you to say.  Also, I use a lot of gestures, so it's very difficult for me to keep my hands still when giving clues.  I find that I need to go into a trance-like state when giving clues, and it's very meditative somehow.  It's very different from the normal levels of nervous excitement I usually experience when playing games.

The best "password" game I have ever played, and one of my 5 favorite party games of all time. Essentially, a clue-giver has to get his team to guess a particular word (as in all "password" games) except that there are five other words which are "taboo" (and of course, these are the five most obvious words you'd use to describe the target word).  There is a little bit of a learning curve for some people figuring out how to "talk around" the taboo words, which can make them pretty frustrated.  But in general, it's a must own for anyone who likes party games.

I've always liked Taboo-style games.  My college friends got very good at them, moving from Catch Phrase to Taboo to 25 Words or Less.  I don't think we have the same level of implicit understanding anymore, but we used to be pretty amazing.  I love the way that different people approach clue-giving, and even the same person can do things very differently from session to session.

I enjoy the "expert" level of Electronic Taboo as well.  It can be quite tricky to avoid so many taboo words.  If we have a smallish group, especially if odd-numbered, I prefer an all-play variant, where everyone guesses, and points are awarded to both the clue-giver and the correct guesser.

Still one of my favourite party games. Easy to roll out to people who don't play all that many board games. No complicated rules to master. Simple, fun and interactive. Players take turns describing a word or phrase on a drawn card to their partner (or team mates) without using any of the five common additional words or phrases on the card. The opposing side get to watch a timer and press the little buzzer squeaker when the time runs out, or the player describing the word uses any of the forbidden phrases or makes any gestures. You score a point for each card your team guesses successfully. Opposing team gets a point for each card your team has passed on or you breached the rules on. One of the best games to play with family and friends on those cold Winter days.

Interactive, funny, fast paced, challenging game of words.  Difficult for those who aren't familiar with the terms, but there is usually something for everyone in here.  Fits my scatterbrained style.  Especially good for family and close friends, as you tend to have similar views and descriptive styles that trigger really random word associations that only someone close to you would get.  This leads to really funny discoveries of your similarities and differences that can make this game really interesting.  I also love finding creative ways to get people to say things.  Good voluntarily is not required, but it definitely gives as edge.

With the right group, this is pretty fun. I usually play with people who I know really well, and we can guess pretty obscure things based on dumb hints. That's fun. I always have to have a house rule for when a pop culture cards come up, though, because half of the people I play with (including myself) don't know anything about pop culture.

Turkey in the ... oven ?!?

This is another fun party game for doing with smaller groups. This plays four comfortably, as opposed to cranium which needs about 6 to be any fun. It is amazing how your brain will tell you aha, I've come up with a perfect solution, only to find out you missed one of the taboo words, or your partner is a complete dolt (or maybe your clue isn't as good as you thought it was in your head... nah, can't be that).

Sore fun party game. Seasoned players will remember many words and it'll be easier for them to guess so it might get a bit disproportional. Though it didn't hinder me from enjoying it, one may be upset when the other team guesses 13 words on double time, thanks to having played the game for like 6 years. I was able to explain quite a few one time anyway, so it's not that big of a deal.

I would rate this higher if it had more replayability. As it is, if you play this game often enough you gain a significant advantage over people who don't. Also, best friends and couples or just people who know each other really well will do amazingly if on the same team - can be fun to watch how they read each other's minds. but can also be sad if you're on the other team and getting crushed. I also find it interesting to see how people associate words differently, as in what are the first things they say (or try to) when they pick up each word?

This party game is fun if you've only played mediocre party games, but suffers from the bane of lots of allegedly "casual" games: it's essentially a contest of a single, very niche-oriented skill, and rapidly (and painfully) splits a party into the "smart" and the "dumb." Not all that recommended unless you enjoy messing with everyone's self-esteem, or unless all participants are comparable word nerds.

A party game where one tries to get their teammates to guess the word on the card. However, the card also has words you cannot use for clues, and an opponent from another team sits behind you to "buzz" you if you say one of those words. Try to get your team to guess as many words as you can before the sandtimer expires.  It is a fun game.

Hilarious party game that demands a quick mind and more often than not a good command of the language. There are two of the usual flaws for this kind of material - the very often great fun can be attenuated by having poor partners (or too good ones, depending on your point of view), and having a finite number of cards limits the shelf life of the game -there are expansions anyway.

Your typical party game. Try and make the person guess the word on the card without saying any of the Taboo words. Only talking allowed. As in most party games, you can only play so many times till the cards are known by all the regulars. And it gets a little repetitive after a while. Still, fun from time to time.

Good party fun.  No matter how easy the task (describing a word without using anything from a list of forbidden words) seems to be at other times, when the timer is ticking and the person next to you has their hand on the buzzer, it's amazing how quickly your mind goes blank.

I enjoy the competitive nature of this game, and I love when you get into a groove where your team really understands your clues.  But it loses points because of the mechanic of the other team buzzing you and the meta-strategy (or cheating) that sometimes is involved there.

I've read that creativity flourishes within constraints. Unlike Funglish, Taboo has just enough constraints, i.e. the taboo words, to make this "Password" variant interesting.

1. Limited number of cards in the base set limit replayability.

The best use of Taboo I've ever seen was when my friend up-ended a box of Taboo cards all over the floor of his flat and they were just everywhere for weeks.

I've never played with the actual rules but I'm sure they're fine too.

As a general rules, I don't like party games, particularly party games where one player is placed at the center of the groups attention.  This means that I really dislike acting out games such as charades.  This game, though, is probably the most palatable of the lot.  While I still wouldn't seek this game out, it seems to be one that I would dislike playing the least.  Besides, I like to think I have a reasonably good vocabulary. [08/14/2007]

I find this game really frustrating.  Either the people who are playing share a set of words and references outside the suggestions on the card which make guessing the cards too easy.  Or, it's impossible to come up with clues other than the ones listed, making the cards too hard.

Taboo is a party game played in teams. Team members take turns trying to get the rest of their team to guess certain words within a set time limit. However, below each word they need to guess is a list of words the clue giver is not allowed to say. Someone from the other team looks on over their shoulder with a buzzer in hand- ready to BZZT them if they mess up. So, you might need to get your team to say television, but you aren't allowed to say things such as show, watch, remote, and cable. This game forces you to think quickly and get creative. Always a fun time! I played this a lot in college, and I would love to play more now, but I don't have a group that enjoys playing a lot of party games.

Very addictive party game.  This game forces creative puzzle solving in how you have to tackle communicating words without taking the easy way out.  Some words are just stupid hard, I'm assuming these were thrown in to keep people from running away with the game, but whenever you plant land mines you never know who will stumble across them.  Regardless, it is fun.  Certainly one of the best party games around.

The old classic rears its head from time to time at family gatherings.  Good for a laugh now and then.  The main problem is that I seem to be either good or horrible at it, depending on the day.

Played many times and laughed myself into a sore throat almost as many. At this point I'm quite good, but I'll go for a good joke over a high score. The only problem with Taboo, as with most party games, is that repetition of the cards diminishes the fun. The cure for that is simple: collect a few different sets (at yard sales).

We own an iOS version (iClue)

Fun, and challenging, game of trying to get your team to guess a word. The twist, of course, is that 5 words (the ones that would make it easy to describe the target word!) are taboo -- you may not use them. In the iClue version, any mistakes (using a Taboo word, saying a form of the word, deciding to skip a word) give you a penalty point; successful words earn your team a point. First team to get to the target score wins! In Taboo, errors earn the other team a point instead (give them the card).

This was actually pretty enjoyable, but I dock 0.5 because it ended up actually frustrating some people too much -- a party game shouldn't do that!

This has always been one of my favorite party games.  Game play is simple; split up into two teams and on your turn try to get your teammates to guess as many words as possible without saying any part of the word or the included "taboo" words.  The game is best played with people you know well and can make a connection with.

Eventually you've seen all the words in the included game  though and when they start to repeat you lose a little interest.

My absolute favorite party game, and hectic games are usually not my thing. So simple, describing words for your team to guess without using the five words one your card is harder and more fun than it seems. It works with very different crowds (friends, families, people you know or not know well), too, I noticed over the years.

A really stellar party game.  I find it most enjoyable when you pair up partners with a relationship (e.g. husband and wife, boyfriend and girlfriend, siblings, etc.).  Many times your personal in-jokes and experiences allow one person to infer a reference from something only they and their teammate would know.  Very, very funny.  Unfortunately it's also a good instrument for demonstrating which people don't know each other very well...

Decent enough party game.  Not quite my cup of tea though.  I find myself hard-pressed not to guess at words that the other team is giving clues for, and quite frequently I forget that I'm supposed to be watching the timer--perhaps one that dings or buzzes when the time's up would be better?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I don't find this to be very entertaining. Awkward, with someone spoiling the experience for the whole group, some subliminal scapegoating, and too many words that at some time in mainstream pop culture had a significance, but are now long forgotten (TV shows, starlets, etc.) Yes, it's easy, playable with large groups and everybody instantly knows the rules, but these are just about all advantages of this game. Disadvantages include: high luck dependence, play-by-play that involves no strategic or tactical thinking at all, utterly boring.Don't even dream of playing this with less than eight players. And try to avoid playing with people who either have all cards memorizid already or try to cheat by peeking at the card that is currently being selected.

Well, there are obviously funny moments, but as a game, even as a party game, taboo is plain boring 95% of the time.

(+~50 Plays before I started counting)

Perfect for non-gamer crowds. A must if you play with spouse and friendly couples. Don't use the board. The game however loses ground if you overplay and learn most cards. The downtime is an issue.

Why does this one not rate higher? Is it the limited deck aspect?

I have two main thoughts about this game.

1. It's good training for parents. Once your kids learn to spell, you will need to learn to speak in code. For instance, when debating which snack to give your child, 

"Should we go with the stale salty bread, or the cellophane-wrapped imitation botanic product?"

2. I will never forget when my friend Bruce grabbed the buzzer out of my hand and threw it across the room after getting buzzed for an inappropriate clue.

A game that inspires that level of passion is a solid 9 in my book.

A classic, everyone will know how to play it. I tend to prefer this to Catch Phrase, as there's a lot more challenge in not saying the illegal words, as opposed to being lucky that the timer didn't stop just as it was passed to you. Plus, the buzzer is awesome.

I can't abide this game. We only have it because my wife likes it. I much prefer Articulate, which only prevents you saying the word itself. This game gives you a list of words closely related to the word and forbids those, and I'm left in painful embarrassment with nothing to say.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Possibly my favorite light party game.  Great for large groups of people who don't normally play games.  Small deck leaves you wishing there were more cards.  As with most party games, this is much better if you don't actually keep score.  When the game is really about socializing, why risk feelings of resentment?

To me, this game became more about getting on a team with someone you know really well, so you have an inside connection than it did about giving good clues. I could give really bad abstract clues but because one of the people I was working with knew what I meant from that one time way back when. This seemed to really alienate other members of your team as they had no idea what you were talking about.

This is probably the deepest "casual" game in existence, and I love it to death. The game challenges you to do something that few other games do - communicate quickly! How you approach this is not trivial, and often a ton of fun. I'm not particularly good at this (it doesn't play to my strengths), but I have way too much fun every time I play it. Nothing is more rewarding than coming up with an obscure reference to completely circumvent the banned list.

One of my favorite party games. Having an out of date version can make some clues cheap (for example, Daryl Hannah is on the "mermaid" card in our edition, but Ariel is not...I've had to explain to several people who Daryl Hannah is). Overall, it's a lot of fun, scales extremely well from 4 up to pretty much as many people as can fit in comfortable hearing distance, and creates some great memorable moments.

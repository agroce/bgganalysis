A really good game, which is almost like a design of Wallace. Very few random events, that affect all players.
Unfortunately the rules are written rather bad, and also there are some special cases, which are not dealt with in the rules.
Or worse, a simple problem has a very complicated solution. (For example when the draw bag runs out of locks...)

Interesting "river" mechanic used for turn order and streamlined pick up and deliver.

Will reevaluate after playing again, and rating will likely go up.  One of the more complicated games as far as learning it the first time goes.  One of the issues is matching up the symbols with the cities can be difficult.

RATING: 6
Rating based on one play

Need to play another time to confirm my first impression, which is that this game has a runaway leader problem (which may or may not be true) and tries to combine a look ahead game with some big chunk of randomness (which takes away planning). The latter makes this an odd game.

Rating -- TBD, but right now I suspect I will end up indifferent.

RATING: 8.5
First Play: There was a mountain to climb to sort the rules for this. The rule book reads like a legal contract; first the definitions (out of context, mean nothing), then the preambles and general overview, lastly the sequence of play that skips over items covered by the first two sections, so nothing reads cohesively.

Despite this I sniffed the essence of a very good game and perservered. 

Game explanation took about 45 minutes. Once the game started it became very clear that player order is crucial. I got caught down stream at the wrong time too many times and had to take on loans when others were buying warehouses that benifitted them later. The mechanism is unique and I can see the game becoming deeply strategic amongst players who know what they are doing.

Maybe the game might suffer if AP prone players are involved. The game needs a player aid with token descriptions and play order laid out. I have produced one and will hopefully upload soon when some questions are answered.

A keeper and I look forward to play #2.

Second Play: Explaining was easier and more effective, players grasped key options much quicker and the opportunity for screwage was never ignored. A brilliant cut throat game. So many options and things to consider. Rating increased to 8.5

Although the rulebook is difficult to comprehend and the tech tree seems to be scripted, I enjoyed my first game of Ruhrschifffahrt. Jostling for position on the river for turn order, maximizing efficiency in getting warehouses built first and getting the right project markers quickly, seems to be where the gameplay shines. Money is tight at the beginning of the game and gets looser towards the end(?). 

I need to play more games to formulate a more concise opinion. For now, it holds an 8 rating.

I liked how the boats flow down river and that there is a costly action to get back up river.  Most of this game feels pretty good with choices to take turn order or advance technology or score points.  Unfortunately, it is also very fiddly... maybe too much.

Too long and too heavy for what it is, which is pickup and deliver, which I prefer to be short and simple. Also, For a 2+ hour game, the actual number of decisions is surprisingly low. That said, this game has some interesting mechanisms for controlling turn order and where you can move that I would like to see implemented elsewhere.

I really seldom rating a game lower than 5, but this one with such a high price and so bad experience... Is it possible that we play this game terrible wrong? I doubt it.

The way you develop tech tree seems have very limited choice if you really want to win. every one will have to do the similar thing, where you sail your boat to is just a price issue, the location never really been a issue, you just do it in different order. And you reach the same tech requirement almost at the same time, then who is the first player win out. Many things that contribute to the randomness in the game don't contribute to fun or strategy or plan in anyway, just a boring add and minus, here or there issue. hey some one is lucky with a coin drop on his head.

all in all , a 60 - 80 dollar game , with such a misleading rule book, with 1 hours to setup the game and teach the rules with various details, you end up with even boring 2 hours game time. Will you like it?  We don't, and happily to find a chance to sell it out.

RATING: 7
I quite like the pacing of floating down a river over multiple turns, then hauling back upriver after you reach the bottom. I love that you not only can, but must deliver coal every turn. In theory that always goodness, but sometimes can be awkward. The river position also being turn order position (sometimes, but not always significant) is pretty interesting, especially because you have broad latitude in where on the river you go. But the most interesting thing is how combinations of different types of coal deliveries (from which part of the river, to which type of destination) unlock abilities, which directly drive your strategy. You cannot change your strategy on a dime, since your abilities are locked-in by the types of deliveries you've made. So to do something different first requires you go make the prerequisite deliveries. Which is generally easy enough to go do, except that doing it inefficiently can be very expensive. Overall nice pacing and good level of player interaction without overt aggression.

The rules are a bit rough. The alternate rules in the Files section are a bit better, but honestly I needed to refer to both at the same time. And the board is missing some key info, or it could be in a player aid.

This game appeared with little fanfare at some forgotten Spiel, although I can remember walking past the booth in hall 10 where it was on sale at a hefty price, and remembering that it was an economic game I probably had no interest in. One of my gaming friends on the other hand [i]was[/i] interested but could not make himself purchase the expensive box unplayed. Over the years he would from time to time remark upon this title as an example of something which ought to have attracted a lot of attention but didn't. Mostly I ignored these pleas for getting me interested... until at some point, having realised that Splotter Games' approach to network building and pickup-and-deliver creates rather good games, I took a closer look at Ruhrschifffahrt. And came to the grudging conclusion it might be worth a closer look. So I located a gamer with a copy, and arranged for him to show me and my gaming friend the ropes.

Ruhrschifffahrt isn't truly a complex game; there's just a lot of stuff built in, and using it all to your advantage takes a game or two before it has sunk in properly. Still, the playing rythm is pleasing, so even if you are a newcomer you will have the most important concepts seen in glorious action by turn three at the most. The game doesn't really support network building as I originally suspected: the network is fixed and one dimensional. But it has been chopped up into a lot of sections with hurdles which can be removed with player actions. You simply load coal onto your barge and transport it to the earliest possible point of interest, and receive an amount of cash in return. Your barge then flows down the river Ruhr on the next turn where you [i]have[/i] to locate a new load of coal to transport. If there isn't any—and this can happen due to turn order effects—you must hire a sweet little horsie to haul your barge up the river to a point where you [i]can[/i] take in coal. This see-sawing is not difficult to enact, and leads to a a series of simple priority issues. 

A second important aspect of the game is that by delivering coal, you automatically gain expertise on various little tracks, which automatically give you certain extra abilities if you meet their requirements. This aspect is very reminiscent of excellent Endeavor, with the important difference that in Endeavor there is only one aspect which determines what building you get, namely your building level. After that, you can choose freely. In Ruhrschifffahrt which building you obtain is fixed. Unfortunately it appears difficult to create a truly specialised profile: in my sample game it came down to a few special one-off buildings to give a little character to the development efforts of the players.

And then it is simply playing to scoop up as many VPs as you can. There are small majority games active, there is a small presence game active, there are points to be had for having a lot of money at the end (if you have the proper special building).

Overall I liked this game, although I could quickly establish that it wasn't a game I needed to own... which is fortunate, because the prices it commands in the aftersales market are not friendly on one's bank statement. The point to this decision is that the see-sawing back and forth across the Ruhr becomes a tad samey after a while; that there isn't much variability between players in how the buildings make their way to the boards; many buildings offer options which allow a player to worm his way out of a tight spot just the same; but truly a little saddening: random events which can really hurt you for no good reason other than that they are a random event. The game is fairly precise and requires players to look ahead; it does not behoove authors to inject brutal randomness into this process.

In the future I'll join in a game without comment, but if that doesn't happen I'm cool with that, too. The '6' is a tad low, but frankly I find it hard to award the game with a '7' because that would mean I'd start looking for a copy, and that is as I said an intention I do not have for the time being.

Very hard game to come by, and if you are lucky enough to find one... You are in for a world of hurt if you don't find someone to teach you the game. The rule book is terrible. 

That said the game is Rube Goldberg assembly of mechanics that are held together well through a highly thematic experience. Nice mix of short term tactical opportunism, as well as trying to balance longer term objectives. I was surprised how much I liked it, and this rating may well go up with repeat plays.

Nice heavy Eurogame with a unique theme and unique mechanics. Sort of pick up and deliver, but in a different way than others in the genre. Dice represents the value of coal, which degrades when moving it along the river and around the locks. Delivering coal allows for players to "unlock" technologies which provide in-game bonuses or VPs.

First impression: The rules are extremely bad written. The mechanics work well togehter but you have to take into considerations too many special rules and special rules of the special rules. There a many questions during a first play and it is hard to find the answer somewhere in the rules. There is an advantage for the first player, and the last one in the first round will have a tough go! Don't play it with a ponderer otherwise you will sit at the table waiting for your move quite a long time.

Players run barges up and down the Ruhr River, Germany, during the Industrial Revolution, attempting to turn a profit and re-invest into infrastructure.

Thematically rich, but simple to play Euro.  The game is divided into 12 turns, each turn following the same sequence.  Some events happen that mirror the history of the Ruhr River, and inject some demand for coal incentives onto the game board.  Then players taken turns placing their barges on a coal space on the river, then deliver that coal to one of three market types - industry, towns, or the export market out of the Ruhr district.  Delivered coal earns cash, as well as progress on a player's own technology tree.  In Bingo fashion, if markers match a particular technology, it is claimed and available for use for the remainder of the game.  

Most technologies allow the construction of warehouses in different areas of the board - cities, export markets, coal depots, etc.  Other technologies open up the game board, such as the lucrative up-river coal deposits, initially locked out of the early game.

The game is ultimately about victory points, which every build action awards - along with some nice end of game bonuses for diversities, majorities, and certain technologies.

This is a very nice game - feels quite thematic, and original.  The game is well presented (apart from the English rulebook, which will take two or three careful readings to get the game down), and plays very cleanly.  Degradation of coal quality using dice, the gradual opening up of the river by constucting locks, and several other touches are lovely additions to the game.  Expensive, but glad I picked it up.  Liked it.

I believe the tech "tree" suggests a variability that isn't actually in the game since some advancements are vital and the choice is never between "this branch or that branch" but usually "which of these two first?" The rest of the game consists of a very simple sequence of actions with limited player influence interrupted only by potentially rather swingy random tile draws. Perhaps unsurprisingly, I think the game runs very long for this sort of game play.

I agree with those who say that Ruhrschifffahrt has a certain Wallace vibe. Like many of Martin Wallace's games, Ruhrschifffahrt is a fairly thematic game with an industrial theme that doesn't shy away from rules quirks to accomodate historical details. I'd say it's mostly a success in this respect. The big difference, however, is the Wallace's creations are rarely one-track affairs.

Bochum, ich komm' aus Dir: Der Lokalkolorit, mit dem der Thomas Spitzer sein Heimatspiel RUHRSCHIFFFAHRT angefüllt hat, erreicht zwar das Herzblutlevel von ARLER ERDE, aber nicht dessen Qualität. Macht nichts: Der holprige Charme von RUHRSCHIFFFAHRT atmet die Aura von Hobbykeller, wo Thomas mit jungenhafter Begeisterung mit seinem Vater Wolfgang sein Liebhaberspiel gebastelt hat mit lokaler Historienliebe. So schippern die Kohletransportschiffe sehr thematisch die Ruhr hinab und verleihen dem Spiel eine Individualität, die nicht darüber hinwegtäuscht, dass dem Kohlewerk der Feinschliff fehlt. Dazu passt die abgrundtief grottenschlechte Regel. Dagegen mutet sogar das chaotische Regelheft von PANAMAX an wie ein Geniestreich. Aber der VFL Bochum und RW Essen sind halt auch nicht der FC Barcelona.

An innovative but sadly overlooked Euro game. Unfortunately official rules are badly translated from German which may deter people; I had to download unofficial rewrite from BGG before I understood how it works. The first few turns we were all a bit clueless, but after a while everything 'clicks' and we began to have fun. If you like thematic economic games, you should definitely enjoy this one.

Imagine a long-winded German scholar of pre-industrial transport. Imagine a slow ferry ride sitting next to this fellow where he details the significance of every passing bend in the development of his homeland's glorious rise to merchant shipping dominance, occasionally pausing the dullness to tell an even duller personal anecdote relating to the dullness currently at hand. Imagine transcribing his pedagoguery. Imagine plugging it into Google translate. That is the rulebook to [thing=130390][/thing]. If you're willing to subject yourself to learning a logistics game from a rulebook of titanic frustration, start with [thing=8138][/thing]. It's a better game anyway.

I've heard that some geeks are actually willing to pay three-digit Euro prices for this game.  

To be honest: from a gamer's perspective, it is worth at most 50 bucks.  It's a decent game of turn-order optimization with a few new ideas.  I have a feeling however, that the game is slightly too unpredictable with 4 players because too much can happen im one turn.  Furthermore, it can happen that one player can significantly fall behind the others, resultimg in a pretty frustrating gaming experience (no, that player wasn't me :) )

I dunno how to rate this yet. Initial impression is that it is more complicated than I generally like. I spent the whole game trying to grok the rules intricacies, while also occasionally getting boned by bad timing in turn order or the "high water" event. I like the tough choices about moving up and down the river, but not all the icon-heavy events and special abilities/tech tree. And boy does this game need some player aids -- for steps of a turn, costs of various builds, and end-game scoring. Streamlined it ain't.

Englobado en la serie del Khole & Kolonie. Mucho más "blandito", se deja jugar bastante bien.

Se trata de un juego cuya mecánica principal es pick & deliver. Tendremos una barquita que moveremos en un río, siempre hacia bajo, partiendo de donde haya carbón y entregándolo en el siguiente espacio consumidor de carbón (ciudades o industrias) El carbón está representado por dados blancos y negros y marcan el valor del mismo. Cuando lo entregas te darán dinero que te permitirá construir algunas estructuras, principalmente, almacenes en las ciudades.

Además cada turno, en función de donde hayas ido entregando el carbón podrás desbloquear cositas especiales, pero ojo, que son limitadas, el que primero llega se la queda.

Al final de la partida, puntuarás por tus estructuras construidas y por algún progreso que hayas conseguido desbloquear

RATING: 9.5
I really love this game as a lengthier Euro. While the actions you can take each phase are remarkably simple, they combine to allow some broader strategy where turn order, reading other players' motivations, and a small amount of luck each play a part. Learning from the rules in the box is a serious chore for English speakers, as the rules as written are hard to understand and have a lot of subtle nuance you will not follow until you play once. Most people get half a dozen rules or more wrong on their first play when learning from the rules in the game. We got probably a dozen things wrong. That said, especially if you can find someone to teach you, the game is a really enjoyable experience. I've never seen a game as short as 2 hours, though. Usually it takes 45 minutes to teach the rules and close to 3 hours to play with 4 players.

I've heard people complain that Ruhrschifffahrt is a little scripted. And to some degree I will agree. But for me that is not a bad thing in a game that tries to capture a historical theme. And that's what the game does marvelously. I love how the development of the area and the infrastructure comes alive over the course of game. A very good, thinky Euorgame that gives you an interesting history lesson.

I have now played this game 4 times.  I feel it is mechanically demanding, and the theme never really grabs hold the way I want it to.  The limited variability of tech advances limits how many approaches you might try in the game.

This is a very nice game and once you have fought (it really is a struggle) through the rule book you have an excellent historical boardgame. First the gripes 1) The rules are unnecessarily lengthy and therefore cause some confusion. 2) The graphics could be better though the only downfall are the town shields which are colourless and hard to distinguish from one another, as you need to refer to these several times through the game it does cause a short hiatus while players discuss which town the icon actually does refer to. The good points are that the game flows very nicely (especially with the player aids on this site) and becomes a game of balancing cash, victory point grabbing and development, a lot of decision making and making the best of "margins" and together with "timing" (it can be very important who goes first in a phase) it all comes together to provide several hours of thought provoking entertainment.

Played once, 3p.  This is actually a pretty decent limited action game, with a technology tree and some resource management (money and technology research cubes).  In fact, this would be quite a good game if not for the random events, most of which are quite benign, but some totally wreck the near term plan.  Another game might clarify how devastating those negative events actually are.

Game play is fairly straightforward but one would never know this from the rulebook which is organized quite differently than most euros.  This is the first game I watched an instructional video to figure out how to play.  Found delivering coal to be interesting as where you ended up delivering coal would decide how you pursued victory points and your strategy.  Warehouses are built to score points in various ways once you build the required technologies.  I do wish they would have put in player aids for the two event phases and the different techs although the techs become pretty obvious quickly.  One needs to consider turn order as you move your ship around on the Ruhr...player order is determined by how far upriver one is.

1st play 8-3-2013. 4p and the game went long mostly due to the flexible turn structure. The game was great, very tight and rules, for being a German translation, were very good i.e. not a single trip to BGG for answers.

Only concern is lack of varied enough paths to victory reducing replay value but since I will only likely play a few times not that big an issue.

Die Spielregeln ist eine echte Katastrophe. Das Spiel danach lernen zu müssen, kommt einer echten Strafe ziemlich nahe. Eine Redaktion scheint nicht stattgefunden zu haben. Struktur? Leider Fehlanzeige! Selbst als Nachschlagewerk kaum zu gebrauchen. Die ganze Regel  enthält weder einen Startaufbau noch erklärt Sie die auf dem Spielbrett verwendeten Symbole.

Das Spiel als solches könnte funktionieren, allerdings macht es in dem derzeitigen Zustand einen noch recht unfertigen Eindruck. Bei einem Preis von teilweise mehr als 60 Euro sollte man etwas mehr erwarten können!

Schade, denn grundsätzlich hat das Spiel durchaus eine Menge Potential, nur leider fehlt neben einem guten Redakteur und Lektor auch noch eine ordentliche Testrunde. Mit einem paar mehr Testspielen, die einige der größeren Lücken sicher aufgedeckt hätten, und ein paar kleineren Anpassungen im Regelwerk hätte was daraus werden können.

A well-designed game.  I think the theme is well developed, but I admit to not being sure what some of the events represent but maybe with a little reading, I would.

A few disconnected thoughts on the game:

* I think the river-barge topological model is new to me. Motion is one-dimensional, but the two directions are asymmetric in a couple of ways. This is an interesting problem space to play with.

* The comments on Thomas Spitzer's games feeling somewhat like those of Martin Wallace in terms of weight, historicity, and idiosyncracy feel apt. I noted it much more here and in Kohle & Kolonie than with Haspelknecht.

* Complaints about the original rulebook are sensible. The rewrite is quite good. Now that I know the game, I'm likely to teach it by paraphrase in the future. We generally teach games from the rules even when someone at the table knows the game, but here as with Food Chain Magnate what happens on a turn is so procedural that it's unlikely to harm play to teach the game from a play aid or something.

A nice game: original and thematic (much more than the average Euro). It is not difficult to play: rules are not difficult; even if the handbook has the fame not to be well written, I had no problem in learning the game, apart for minor things. It is replayable. The only (somehow not small) minus is that the choices offered, although interesting both at the strategic and at the tactical level, are too few (there is not a huge decision space as I prefer in games).

Updated rating after four plays.

Much like other highly thematic games, there are a lot of rules - but once you start playing, they tend to make intuitive sense. Actual play is very simple:
a) Pick an action and move your boat to a coal depot
b) Deliver the coal and make money
c) Use your abilities to score VPs

Even the Ruhrport warehouses and such are not hard. When coal goes to Ruhrport, the indicator ticks up depending on the quality of the coal. At the end of the round, bonus points equal to the indicator level (plus bonus points based on warehouse position) are awarded. Then move marker back down again based on number of warehouses. Simple, right?

I have a lot of affection for this game - it's exactly what I'm looking for in a game. Thematic yet tight, fun to play and rewarding of good play. My only quibble is that the "no pilot" tiles are little too swingy, but there's a suggested variant in the rulebook to take 2 of them out, which should make that a non-issue as well.

After a couple more plays, we've decided that the "no pilot" rounds are key to making the game work. Take that uncertainty out and the game becomes too predictable and programmable. Keep the randomness in and the game shines as folks groan and try to plan on the fly for a delivery they hadn't really wanted to make just then.

Great game, well worth checking out. Rating bumped up to a 9 as a reflection of my pretty much never being unwilling to play.

This game is a bit of a conundrum for me.  On one hand, I really like how the tech track works, and how making certain types of deliveries opens up more things that you can do in the game.  On the other hand, the way it sets up seems to railroad players into doing very specific things during the game, and punishes players pretty severely for straying from the path.  There really doesn't seem to be enough strategic diversity here, and at times it really feels like the game is playing you instead of the opposite.  I really wanted to like this game, as it has some very clever mechanisms, but it just doesn't do it for me on the execution level.  Oh, and the rules are a mess.

One play where we played some things wrong, but corrected them during gameplay. For the price they asked (and certainly are now asking here in the BGG market) the quality components & value for what you get is clearly very low. And the artwork ain't that great either (was there really no other way to put the scutcheon then as a watermark INTO the name?).

The game itself: good, but not that good that I would pay 70 euro for it. It's a sort of race to get things delivered first at certain locations to unlock certain actions/bonusmarkers (as for instance the bonusmarkers for warehouses and for leftover money are limited to 2), hopefully in combination with a high value dice. However there is no hiding in this game: there are only 12 rounds, so if you wanna go for the warehouses bonus, you have to start building right away or you won't have finished before the end of the game, so it will be clear to anybody that that will be your main target. My feelings after 1 play is that it could be a bit more streamlined, that some parts really feel mechanic. 

But if Davy wants to play it again, I'll be glad to join ;-)

Feels a bit like a Martin Wallace game. Plays ok with three but I think four would be better. Some decent quirkiness, but the overall experience wasn't worth the additional cost of game and additional frustration of getting through the oddly organized rules. The actual game isn't hard to understand or teach once one person knows it though.

Ended up trading it with no real regrets. I would still happily play it if I run across it though.

Once one gets past the rules, there is a very nice game here.  The trouble is one has to wade through a mass of disorganized rules to find critical information.  As an example, the fact that a warehouse in a city earns 1 Thaler when coal is delivered in the city is NOT found under Movement and Coal Sales, but rather under Purchasing Warehouses as a benefit for buying a warehouse in the city.  Fortunately, the excellent summaries in the files section help tremendously to form the mental framework upon which to hang the rest of the rules.  Once that effort is made, a nice game does emerge.

At its heart, this is a pick up and deliver game with an interesting technology tree based upon what was delivered where.  Add in turn order manipulation and there are some nice things to consider each turn.  Mechanistically, the game flows along very quickly as it lasts only 12 turns total.

I really like the mechanics of this one, a little pick-up-and-deliver, plus I like how the coal degrades over time. There also is an interesting tech tree type aspect based on your deliveries. The problem with this one is that I think it's a race to getting access to the upper river and would suffer from a lack of replayability.

This is actualy a pick up and deliver game. Players travel along the Ruhr and deliver coal to cities, coal depots and distant markets. When they do so they get money and one development cube in a kind of tech tree that should allow players to make new (or better) actions.
It's simple as a concept but the bad rules and, in my opinion, the difficult graphics make the game more obtuse than needed.
As a gaming feeling I didn't particularly enjoy the fact that on the first 4/5 turns everything is too much scripted and player's choices aren't brilliant because they can't be. The game allows only a few changes from player to player, as a strategy, after a certain point, making it boring.
Replayability seems low because the tech development tree doesn't change from game to game and it seems that once a path is chosen as a favorite, one can always choose the same path on each game because the paradigm of play remains the same no matter what are the circumstances of the board at any given point.

extremly hard rules to read.   A lot of moving parts and the mechanic for adding 1 or 2 vps down in the Rurh port is really hard to rmember to do.  Just ignore it and roll a die when you need to award those points.  Not sure it is worth $120 though

I find this a difficult one to call, not least because we only played a partial game.

It [i]seems[/i] complicated, but this was probably more down to language difficulties when being taught. I think its aiming at the "Brass" market, but it actually felt more like "Hansa Teutonica" when playing: each turn you do one fairly simple action, then can perform each extra action that you have earned the right to use, and have resources/cash for.

Although that first (partial) play didn't grab me, I'd be happy to try it again.

This is an excellent example of a game that's actually quite simple, but is very hard and slow to learn from the rules. Ultimately, all you're doing is saying "my boat is here at X with this coal", then saying "now I deliver the coal to Y" which earns you money based on the starting value of the coal, and perhaps the length of the delivery.

There's a very interesting tech development system, that springs from the destinations you deliver coal to, and the type of coal used. There are 2 different colours of coal, and 3 possible places to deliver to, so there are six different areas to fill in. So, if you deliver black coal to an Industry and black coal to a City, you develop a pattern that looks like this "o - o". This simple pattern unlocks the ability to build locks on the river, which means future coal will be worth more you deliver it. Some of the higher tech upgrades require 8 or 9 different deliveries, some multiple times. So that's deliver black coal to a city 3 times, white to an industy twice, and so forth. It's more complicated to describe than to do, because the game does an excellent job of marking things on your personal player mat. Each time you deliver a type of coal to a certain place, you mark it with a cube. So, you visually have a reference of "3 cubes - 1 cube - 2 cubes" and can easily see that this matches a particular upgrade you want.

My only quibble with the game is there's a random factor at the start of each round that can really mess up planning. Normally, coal can only be delivered to the next destination on the river. There's a "Pilot" option on the board which allows delivering coal a long distance. Because of the tech upgrades I just mentioned, you're going to have specific things in mind such as "this turn, I plan on delivering white coal to a city, which will give me my second marker of that type, completing a 2-3-2 pattern and earning a key upgrade". Now, what happens is you draw a random chit out of a bag at the beginning of the round. If this chit is marked "No Pilot", then long deliveries simply can't be done this turn. It's not that long deliveries are more expensive, you literally cover up the space on the board and it's forbidden. So this easily can mean that there is no coal of the right colour that can be delivered to a destination you need this turn, as none are in the right spot.

This can (and did) happen to us several turns in a row. Very very frustrating. I wouldn't mind so much if the price got higher, because then I could plan for it. The rules explain that this is all very thematic as the weather and water levels could cause coal to be unable to be moved along the river. But, very often the best thing in a game is to not be slavishly dedicated to theme. They're supposed to be fun, after all.

I really liked the game other than this part, and it's something I would definitely house rule.

Maybe not a gamers game but certainly a heavy Euro with a great theme that fits the mechanics of play and doesn't feel pasted on. Plenty of decisions to make on which upgrades to pursue and how to get to the better valued coal. Rules are reasonably well written in English with plenty of examples. There is luck in the game in terms of the event tile that comes out and will affect everyone at the beginning of a round.  If you hate luck in games, you won't like this element.

A very good game with the misfortune of having a bad set of rules (thank you to the author of the replacement rules) and a very low print run.

I didn't even try to read the real rules past the first page or so, and the replacement rules are fine.  

Even with the revised rules, it was relatively hard to explain the game.  Not because the mechanics were particularly difficult, but rather because it was difficult to understand what all the moving parts did.  So, I felt like we struggled to "get" the game for the first half of the game, and then once we did, it was a bit too late for some. 

I'm really interested in playing it again, as there are more strategic choices than initially appear.

Played once. Heavy mine transporting game where you move coal goods down river and then need to use horses to pull back up-river.

Players take 1 action each and transport coal downstream using a boat.  Coal is represented by either black or white die, the value of the coal is represented by the pip value.

Players deliver coal for 2 main reasons: cash flow and getting cubes in the respective color regions on your player board so they unlock the special abilities on your board.

Playing it for the first time, I found the game to be very hard to understand, or conceptualize what the game wanted me to do.  

We also got a lot of things wrong, we assumed incorrectly that grey arrows go to grey arrows, etc; rather than what the rules say which is the distance is 2 and the pilot action allows you to go any distance down river.  

Further, we forgot many times to pay the bank when making a delivery to construct a cube on our player board; I feel this could have been fixed if they had a coin icon inside the boxes where the cubes go.  

The rules are not written very well, the re-written rules help, but barely.

Iconongraphy is also quite hard, especially on city spaces where they have semi-transparent icons which get progressively get covered up by wooden houses.  Why the designer thought it was a good idea to have the city icons small, hard to read, semi-transparent and progressively getting covered up is anyone's guess.

Another design blunder is the cost to build warehouses in Rhuport the only port in the game.  It needs to clearly mark it on the board.

In terms of gameplay, its not hard to understand, but the actions you take have big time ramifications, if you don't plan well it'll cost you big time in loans.  

I do not think the gameplay was as smooth as it could have been, our runthrough took 4 hours and got lots of things wrong, the game relies heavily on you remembering a lot of things, its not a sandbox game.

One final issue I have is the way the dice are placed into the "dice transportation", its quite hard to follow or understand.  All dice enter the arrow; except when it doesn't.  Dice must be taken from the arrow space.  Its all too convoluted.   It would have been a good idea to redesign this.

A further issue I have is, the game relies heavily on you getting access to the white die as fast as possible.  This seems very powerful.  You want to position your boat high as possible so that you get as many deliveries to get your income up.

The game is quite heavy, money is tight and if the rules were clearer, the flow of the game was better organized and the icons and helpsheets were available I think I would be more comfortable giving this a higher rating.

Prospective buyers should also be aware the game seems to have a replayability issue.

Given that I don't think its something I'd play more than twice I think its a heavy game.

My rating: 7/10

It's not the best among the Catan games.  My rating reflects my recommendation towards potential purchase as well as desire to play.

RATING: 10
What can I say. 11 out of 10 if it's possible. We love this game, yes I wish it could be expanded to 6, but, the game play is still great. The temple factor adds a new dimension to it offering players who produce brick or ore an outlet instead of having to trade.

How can you say no to LDS (Mormon) Settlers of Catan?  haha j/k.  I bought this for my Mormon friend and it's actually pretty fun.  The "temple contribution" allows you to do something with all that extra brick.

great production, less setup time than standard settlers, another scoring opportunity with the temple stones.  i think it works fine with 2 players too, no variants necessary.  for people who aren't interested in expansions, this is a great choice.

I'm still debating whether or not the temple is a substantial difference in the game.  It's a quick and easy 2 points, but I am not sure if it is worth it.

RATING: 5
I prefer the original Settlers of Catan over this.  The only benefit this has is the static board frame to hold the map together -- otherwise, I prefer the completely random boards and lower point total of the original.  I also dislike the temple stones aspect, since there really isn't a benefit to them until the end of the game.  Longest road and largest army have other benefits (connecting to new areas to settle and moving the robber baron/stealing cards, respectively).

RATING: 6
All Pieces are there but the board is ripped along the fold.  Still perfectly playable.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It's basic settlers with three primary changes: specific two-player rules (though we  still play two colors each), temple building, and board construction.  The tiles come on five-, four-, and three hex long strips that are two sided.  Not as infinite as separate hexes, but still highly configurable.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I actually played this before playing Settlers of Catan and my whole family loves it.  It is much easier to keep track of victory points in this game than in Settlers of Catan.  It is not as random as Settlers of Catan, which we don't like.

I got this one because all my friends have the regular one, but I ended up trading it. I missed the sheep. Also, you can't get expansions for this one. There's only one difference in gameplay--the ability to buy stones for the temple--and one or two new cards, but it's not enough to be worth it.

I found this to be okay.  It was a fun group that I played with...the game didn't drag horribly.  But, I didn't discover games because of Settlers, so I don't see the big deal about this and other settlers games.

I've been sort of curious about this game ever since it first showed up, and I picked it up when Tanga had it on deep discount (I'm a little bit of a Settlers collector). In general, it's a fairly medicore novelty Settlers, and with the exception of the Development cards it's not particularly attractive. You aren't buying this on the game or production quality - just a get a copy of regular Settlers - but for the Mormon tie-in.

Regardless of what you think about Mormon theology (i.e., whether you're a Mormon on one end, or whether you think Mormonism is more of a cult than a religion at the other extreme), I think there were better ways to do this. For a pro-Mormon slat, the game could have featured some of Utah's gorgeous scenery (like Zion National Park, for instance, a place with ties to Mormonism) and could have integrated the story of Mormonism more strongly instead of being very lightly re-tooled Settlers. Honestly, many of the Monopoly "re-themings" have done a better job.

Got this because reviewers suggested it played better for 2 than standard Settlers.  We've just played once so far, but don't see it as that much better.  Still, at Tanga prices is makes a nice gift.

Great game. Love the Mesoamerican theme. My wife bought it for my birthday and after our first game she wanted to play it every night. Better than the basic Settlers, but it loses a rating point because there is no 5-6 player expansion.

The Mormon version of Catan that adds the temple-building mechanic.  Nice touch.  The only thing I don't like is that the hexes are fixed, not variable.

RATING: 6
I think Settlers is just not in my wheelhouse. Even when I want to find a gateway game to play, I prefer other choices. 

I do think Settlers of Zarahemla is a slight upgrade on the Catan version.  The modular boards make set-up easier and cleaner. The temple VP option adds just enough to make the game work with 2p and increase the choices a bit. 

I don't think the religious theme is here nor there. Its pretty peripheral.  The comments where people think this is some kind of Mormon proselyting tool are laughable. 

Bottom line though, I just find the resources from the dice and subsequent trading to be a bit of a painful mechanic after a short time. I'm willing to play, but I won't ever request it.

I&#039;ll take a shot at answering some of the questions posed by Chris and  reiterated so eloquently by Aleister. 1. Is the Church of Latter Day Saints a haven of boardgaming that is unappreciated? A) I don&#039;t know if this was asked facetiously or not, but the answer is quite frankly, yes. Mormons are encouraged to set aside every Monday night for Family Home Evening. Family members stay home, and there&#039;s a lesson and an activity, which is frequently a boardgame. Because of this, there are more than a few Mormons into modern style boardgaming. However, there are many that still play only Mormon themed games on Monday night. Surprisingly, there are a lot of Mormon themed games out there; not surprisingly, they&#039;re BAD. Some are just clones of say, Monopoly or Clue, others are original but very simplistic. They are all independently and cheaply made. If you think you have problems trying to get someone over for a night of games that grew up on the old standard American games, just try to get someone over that has been raised on Mormon themed games. *shudder* 2. Do they hope it will be a conversion tool for us, the wandering bordgamers devoid of a spiritual life? A) Yes, this will be a missionary tool, but not for heathen boardgamers. It will be a tool to convert Mormons into the light of good gaming. Actually, other than someone questioning who the Gadianton Robbers or Stripling Warriors were, or where the heck&#039;s Zarahemla, there is really no attempt to preach the word here. I think it is just what it claims to be: Settlers of Catan with a Mormon theme (like Mormonopoly!). 3. Do they expect this to sell and make money? A) This game will sell like wildfire through the Mormon community. Remember how addictive this game can be? Actually, now that I think about it, Mormons are a frugal lot. I can see some pass on this game because of the reletively high price tag, and buy the $12 Scripture Search game next to it. *shudder* Other than that, I don&#039;t know what Klaus Teuber&#039;s position is on all this. I too find crossover attempts awkward and questionable, but this one I like, in the grand scheme.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Finally!  Now Mormons can play Settlers of Catan on Family Home Evening night!  Actually, this is 95% regular settlers with an easy to set up board.  Great for teaching new people to play.  Just tell non-Mormons that the strange names are bad science fiction.  Having been raised Mormon, that actually is a good enough explination of the Book of Mormon itself.

Klaus Teuber game. Less expensive than Settlers of Catan. Has beautiful artwork, components, and board. Tile groupings prevent some wacky setups.

Lots of opportunity for mucking about the other players, but a dedicated player can speed things up.

Don't let the religious theme scare you away -- it's transparent after first few games. Very attractive and durable pieces.

The length of the game plus the potential for long-running conflict make this game a little wearison for me on repeated playings.

Basically a latter-day saint imitation of the awesome Settlers of Catan. It's not too different apart from the different names for everything.

This is the nicest version I have seen yet. Amazing production values. I haven't actually seen the contents of the latest Kosmos version, but I'd say this has to be close. Really nice art and all of it is original to this edition. As for the Church of Jesus Christ Latter Day Saints aspect, it doesn't bother me. It basically gives it a Tikal like quality that doesn't detract from the game itself. Only downfall I see is why not make it somehow capable of expanding to 6. I mean isn't this marketed to Mormons? Most of the Mormon families I know have at least 5 family members so a 6 player capability would probably be welcome (the back of the box quotes a mother of 6 saying how great the game is). Still it is very highly recommended. After really playing the game I must add that I am very disappointed at the quality of the cardstock used for resource cards and the development cards. They are much too thin. The artwork on them is nice (although the artist's ability to draw human anatomy is suspect). In addition the card backs should be more distinctive between resource cards and development cards, the color change is not enough. In our first game everyone kept picking up all of their cards when they intended to only pick up resource cards. But  the game itself is great. The temple building was a great outlet for those who could not get the resouces to build roads or settlements or buy development cards. Very nice.

A very beautiful, well-designed Settlers of Catan variant. The board is very nice and the temple building a fun addition. The LDS theme is helpful in easing in other LDS people.

I gave this the same rating that I did for Settlers of Catan although I do feel that the components of this game are much nicer.  The artwork is awesome and the components are of a much higher quality then the mayfair version.  It's also nice to have the extra temple building bonus card.  I have successfully used it to introduce fellow Mormons to gaming.  The only negative is that there are no expansions for it.

RATING: 6
Really only worth owning for novelty value, and even then only for those who are LDS.  All of the titles of the development cards are kind of funny and do a decent job at providing some flavor.

The production quality is quite low, the cards feeling very flimsy, and the smaller hexes kind of annoying.  The border is moderately useful in keeping the hexes together, even though here they come in strips (as in Simply Catan).  The most annoying thing, though, is the change in resources, adding water as a resource.  For those that are familiar with the game, it is a confusing change and interrupts the flow of the game.  

Adding the temple building thing is mildly interesting, and has been seen in other Settlers scenarios.  Overall I find it a distraction, however, adding unneeded length to the game.  Both longest road and largest army give you some type of benefit, though contributing to the temple only drains you of resources.  Though I guess you gain in righteousness.  :)

Game in a Nutshell: Take regular Settlers and add a little wall/pyramid you can chip away at for some points.

Played as: 3 player

Pros: Adding the wall was a nice idea although it's more of a take-it or leave-it addition. Still retains most of the fun of Catan.

Cons: If they were going to copy Settlers of Catan, I don't know why they screwed it up by attaching the hexes like they did. 

Other: Played once and didn't see any advantage over the original. Basically, I would never buy nor recommend this game when Settlers of Catan does it better.

Best Use: When you both want Settlers of Catan and live in the type of house where face cards are frowned upon.

Mormon version of settlers of catan, which wouldn't normal appeal to me, but the theme is very subdued. I wouldn't have even noticed it was the Mormon version if I hadn't read about it on bgg. It is by far the most beautiful implementation of settlers that I have seen. Excellent board art. It is almost exactly the same as settlers of catan except for one extra way to score points which is by adding the most stones to the tower.

I&#039;d like to reiterate what Chris Farrell said: Now, I understand that the Mormons are the fastest-growing major religious organization in the world. I like their thoughts on choice &amp; personal responsibility. Still, the first thing I thought on seeing this game was &quot;wow, that&#039;s odd&quot;. Was Settlers of Canaan that big a commercial success? Is the Church of Latter-Day Saints a haven of boadgaming that is unappreciated? Do they expect this to sell and make money, or do they hope it will be a conversion tool for us, the wandering bordgamers devoid of a spiritual life? The Mormons after all apparently have a serious missionary zeal. And what&#039;s Klaus Teuber&#039;s position on all this? I must admit that I think of gaming as being a rather humanistic, social activity, so crossover attempts (this, Settlers of Canaan, Redemption) always feel awkward to me, judged in the grand scheme.

Book of Mormon themed Catan! Uhm, yeah! Score!

RATING: 5
I give this game a 5 not because it's average on every level.  But because my atagonism to Settlers (in all its forms) can at times be overcome by a masochistic desire to play it.  This seemingly endless game is a combination of brutal vicious economic conflict broken by periods of inaction where dice rolls deprive you of any sort of role in the game.  But that's how all Settlers games are.  Though, the set up is shorter in this redevelopement so I like it better than vanilla SoC.

Same game as Settlers of Cataan. Lots of fun for 'date night' game, as you can play with another couple. The specialty cards are generally very weak (we threw a few of them away). Overall, a game I could enjoy playing very often. Just enough luck involved to give novices a chance at winning.

A much prettier [b]boardgame[/b] version of Settlers (as opposed to the tile-and-blocks original version). If you aren't interested in Settlers expansions, I see no reason not to get this more inexpensive version instead (forget the religious theme and just play in jungle).

I love the look of this game and was surprized to see that it costs less than Settlers of Catan at my local game store. I think it adds a little more to the original game than the original, without being a very different game or an full-blown expansion.
I love the Zarahemla design, both components and artwork are excellent.
One of my favourites to play with friends and family.

My first Tanga purchase! Not the best components, but it's still Settlers. The addition of temple building makes the game a little richer, and the religious theme is fun.

Ok, so this actually isn't that bad.  But why play this, which is nearly identical to Settlers of Catan, when Settlers of Catan has more variety from game to game?  If you feel the need to build temple blocks on an unchangeable board while you play, get the first set of German historical scenarios and play Cheops....because then at least you can flip it over and play Alexander the Great.

Settlers of Catan with another theme (Book of Mormon). Addition: you can contribute to temple building, the biggest contributor scores 2 VPs. Do not look for originality here. Also, do not be confused with the 2-4 players on the box, it is not any better suitable for 2 players than normal Settlers (maybe even less, as the board is not so modular and it's not easy/possible to play some of the recommended 2p variants with reduced board). Also, if you're used to normal Settlers, the colors will be a bit confusing (esp. the change of sheep for water).

An excellent light game. More beautiful than the regular Settlers of Catan.

The only downside is that the tiles are not individual :(.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Generally, this is a superior alternative to the original Settlers. It's largely modular, but you have one extra thing to build (the Temple/Pyramid/Wall/whatever). The pieces are also better than any of the other English editions (currently, Mayfair or Cactus' Settlers of Canaan). The downside? Not expandable.

If you like Settlers of Catan, you'd probably like this, too.  Although it has a religious/Book of Mormon theme, the theme is just chrome - you can still enjoy the game without it.  There is a new way to get points in this one (specifically, by building a Temple, which doesn't impact the game in any other way except to give points to the biggest contributer). 

Not a bad version of Catan.

I've always liked it more than most because it's so much easier to set up.  The temple is an interesting twist too.  While those are both positives, it does lack that certain something to make it a great Settlers variant.

RATING: 7
I like this game. It plays easily and quickly but that robber can become quite annoying when it comes up too often.  I like the adjustable board which lets the set up vary but keeps the tiles fairly well balanced.  And the building of the temple gives you another direction to go for points.

While this version of the classic settlers, which is also just as good, lacks the expansions, for the basic game it is dramatically better with a few new additions, and more tuned set up and board design. This is a rather easy to learn, yet fun and long planning strategy game.

Awesome version of Settlers of Catan!  Much more visual appeal and with the temple building; one more method of scoring!

RATING: 9
Alternate CATAN theme with unique extra task for points which uses a different combination of resources to acquire. Themed after the Book of Mormon, this has a jungle adventure feel, not a religious overtone.  The theming is really lush and beautiful. Much more enjoyable than standard Catan.

Better than the original and the original is a classic. I played the original Settlers close to 100 times, got tired of it and sold it. Now many years later, I've gone back to playing this game and I still think it's one of the best designs of all time.

I originally purchased this before Settler of Catan.  I didn't want the same game EVERYONE else had.  But, it turns out that it isn't quite the same (and not as fun) without the distinctly separate hexes.  Zarahemla doesn't have the diversity that Catan does, so falls short for me (and is why I since purchased Catan as well).

My wife and kids LOVE the game.  It is essentially Settlers of Catan with a few twists to target it to the LDS culture but that is enough to make it appealing to my wife.  Which is all that counts.

I like the addition of building the temple as a way to victory points. Also, changing sheep to water makes it easier to tell the difference between wood for me. No expansions is at the same time great and bad.

Great because I don't get completionist anxiety over it, but bad because it feels like it's missing something.

Very well made variant of classic Settlers game.  The board is easier to set up and the temple stones add another method for accumulating victory points.  My wife and I played this game almost every week for a year.  A lot of fun and very replayable with the changing board.  Highly recommended.

A very good game. It adds a whole new dimension to Settlers. Anyone can play this game and you DON'T have to be Mormon to enjoy it.
You won't be tempted to convert either by playing it!
So stop worrying and enjoy a good version of Settlers!

RATING: 7
Excellent game. My first exposure to the realm of Settlers and well done. Great game and replay value is at a premium.

UPDATE: I've dropped the rating down to a 7. Its a great introduction game and is fun to play as a change. However, a string of unfortunate dice rolls can pretty much elimante a player's participation for a good chunk of the game. I've turned to more interactive and consistently engaging games.

oh settlers, with a fatebased theme, for a fate which I am not. I don't like settlers so I don't like this. The temple building aspect is just really not good, you don't want to lose those resources for two points as both stone and clay are too important. Changing the name from sheep to water is just not.

A very good Settlers of Catan clone.  This one is very much the same except for the Book of Mormon them, different resources and extra temple scoring method.  Also, among games for the LDS market, this one is the best that I am aware of.

Even better than the Settlers of Catan core set. When forced to chose between the quality of Zarahemla and the quantity of Catan (with its expansions), the perfectionist in me went for the optimized game-play of Settlers of Zarahemla.

another lucky dice game, but fun and light as needed occasionally.

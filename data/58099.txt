It's Alhambra but with added mechanisms and complexity. That makes it not nearly as good when it is essentially the same game. It is really fiddly with having to flip tiles as they come out depending on what the game dictates that round. I think maybe we just love the simplicity of Alhambra so much that this game sort of wears on us. But still going to hold onto it if for no other reason that we love using its beautiful board to play Alhambra on.

An Alhambra variant.  The double sided buildings make it a little more tactical than the original. But the beauty of the original is that it is an excellent gateway game.  This is not, nor is it interesting enough to become a gamer's game.  Falls somewhere in between.  I'll stick with Alhambra and trade this on.

i like this better than Alhambra. i know BLASPHAMY! but in Alhambra my games always go like this:

well only the low point building are for sale so i will buy one

oh, now you get to buy a high point building, ok

my turn again, well only the low point building are for sale so i will buy one

oh, now you get to buy a high point building, ok

In Granada the points are awarded based on majority, no color building is worth any more than any other and if you dont like the color of the ones available, there is a different color on the other side and you can pay a little extra to flip it over.

I love Alhambra and this is VERY much the same game with some small changes.

I don't like that there is too much different tiles to build. It's hard to plan and keep a strategy.
I miss all the expansions. :)
I DO like the new point-system.
I DO like the doublesided tiles, since you then can't feel safe of winning until the last tile.

Alhambra is a much better game, but this one is still great.

This is not "based on" Alhambra, it *is* Alhambra, with the barest of changes.  Namely, double-sided tiles where you can pay $3 to flip them once you buy them, and modified scoring.  I'm a bit irked that the box leads you to believe it's a new game.

Essentially this is Alhambra with some minor rules changes - that make parts of the game more complex and take away the effortlessness of the original game. Managing the scores in particular is a minor PITA. If you own Alhambra, you'll probably end up playing the original rather than this copy.

RATING: 7.6
Almost identical to Alahambra, but I feel it is an improvement in a few ways. There are more colors of tiles, and buying tiles always has an impact on the game. The number of points given for each color depends on how many are on the board. So if you buy another Purple tile you're either directly helping yourself or helping your opponents.

The flipping mechanic also adds some variety and increased competition. The tiles also look better than our Alahambra tiles.

We end up playing this often with six players, but I don't like playing it with six players because market is overly chaotic. With six players, you might see something you'd like but by the time everyone else gets a turn and it's back to you, that tile probably will be gone. Arrgh.

Play the game with less than 6 people. Maybe 4 people. More calm market. Inner peace.

I understand the difference but I really don't think Alhambra needed another version.  This version is harder to keep track of what everyone else has (because of there are 9 types now!), and the tile replenish thing with odd/even is fiddly.  The ability to pay to flip a tile is interesting but adds more analysis paralysis (again combined with 9 different types).

The "game board" is also needlessly way too big, leaves less room on table for folks to build their Alhambra's.  Should have kept Alhambra's style.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The scoring track / board that Alhambra should have had, we will use the board for both games. More colors and flip able tiles make it harder to track what others are doing but takes more of the luck of the draw out of the game. Back side color arrow on front of tile is not color blind friendly. Score cards could use some color. Another plastic box insert that does not match the game.

RATING: N/A
Read the rules and this looks really interesting. I don't really like Alhambra but this game is different... but also not different. 

You are collecting tiles to build in your own area, you are using several kinds of currency to do it and spending exactly for something does let you continue your turn. What caught my eye is the scoring. There are three scoring rounds that come up pseudo-random. The first scoring round awards points to the person who has the most of each type of building, they get points equal to the total number of building of that type owned by all players. The second rounds awards the majority player twice the total number those buildings and the second place player points equal to the total number. The third round awards the majority 3 times the number, the second player 2 times and the third player the total number.

This is pretty clever stuff, adding the decisions, also the scoring ramps up so the game should not have a run-away winner thing. The downside is the set-collection-for-my-own-player-mat thang and the particular flavor of player interaction it allows.

Úgy tűnik nekem pont ennyi variálás kellett, hogy még jobban élvezzem az Alhambrát. A tábla szuper, nincs az a gagyi pontozó+építési tartalék, egyben van minden egy remekül kialakított játéktéren. A pontozás nagyon tetszik, könnyű megjegyezni, kiszámolni. A pontozás+a megfordítható lapkák sokkal több taktikai lehetőséget nyújt, és kétfős játékban több értelme lett a megvásárolt épületet Dirknek adni, simán növelheted a saját pontszámodat ezáltal. Az ellenfél lapkáit is jobban figylembe kell venni, így lényegesen interaktívabbnak tűnik. Nagyon örülök, hogy sikerült beszerezni, tökéletes lesz az Alhambra és a milliónyi kiegészítője helyett.

Majdnem tökéletesen ugyanaz, mint az alap Alhambra. Csak van hozzá tábla is, meg az épületlapkák kétoldalasak, és 3 pénzért meg lehet őket fordítani. A tábla nem csúnya, stílusa pont mint az Alhambráé egyébként, de az elrendezése elég szerencsétlen. A húzópakli például eltakarja bizonyos irányból nézve a felcsapott négy pénzlapot. Nincs hely a dobópaklinak. A páros/páratlan helyek két külön kartonlapra kerültek, így ha a jelölőbábut nem átemeljük amikor átraknánk a másik mezőre, hanem a táblán húzzuk, akkor megakad a két kartonlap találkozásánál (egy picit). Apróságok, de azért...
A játék amúgy nem rossz. Kifejezetten könnyen tanulható (2 perc elég hozzá), elsőre is teljesen élvezhető, nyelvfüggetlen. Interakció csak indirekt módon jelenik meg benne: elhúzni mások elől a nekik kellő épületeket vagy pénzlapokat, konkurálni velük bizonyos épülettípusok esetén, azaz többet, vagy nagyobb értékűeket felépíteni, mint ők teszik.
Fal helyett víz van (tengerpart), aminek a hossza pontot ér mindhárom értékeléskor. Érdemes egy-két épülettípusból nekünk felépíteni a legtöbbet, ráadásul úgy, hogy ne csak legtöbb legyen, hanem abból a néhány fajtából, amiből jók vagyunk, kifejezetten sok épület legyen. Ebből lesz a sok pont. Kicsit megunhatónak tűnik, ha tényleg ez az ideális stratégia. Egy játék után jó volt, kellemes volt, de olyan nagy potenciált nem érzek benne. Egyáltalán nem gondolkozom például azon, hogy megvásároljam, mert nem olyan jó.

An Atlanta Game Fest user emailed the group, saying: 
"If you enjoy Alhambra, have you tried Granada? It's the same game, except the tiles are 2 sided (different colors), and the scoring is determined by how many of each color have been played (instead of using a chart)."

Seems like it could be real fun. Also seems to play more quickly.

The scoring was actually simplified and the dreaded splitting points for ties which was a sore spot for me with Alhambra is gone replaced by a more elegant system for breaking ties.

I’ve never played Alhambra. I know, right? Well Granada is a retheme of the SdJ winner, with a few additional “gamerly” elements. Like many euros of its ilk, Granada is very easy to explain and learn. I think the added elements (double sided building tiles, and the ability to flip them for a cost) provide some control that mitigates the randomness. It’s a solid game, but nothing elevates it into “great” territory. It sits in a crowded niche of light euros, but doesn’t stand out from that crowd. I could be talked into it, but it and its predecessor are not on my radar.

Totally superfluous is you own Ahambra. and if you don't own Alhambra then but it rather than Granada

Moreover i'd much rather play the original game - the scoring in Granada is more complicated (maybe if you want a tougher game fine, but thats not what i play ALhambra for)

The flip tiles ability just gives more ability for analysis and therefore paralysis.

Granada is the re-implementation of Alhambra that improves on all fronts.  The board and tiles are larger and brighter, but for more strategic play, every tile can be flipped to deploy an alternate color--effectively doubling the size of the market.  The most significant improvement is the scoring, which dynamically values each color based on its total popularity at the table.  A gamer's Alhambra.

RATING: 5.5
First Impression:

A definite improvement over alhambra.

This game is practically alhambra, with upgraded components and a few small, but to the point, differences. The game is better than alhambra, without being more complex, as it gives the players the option of selecting the color of their bought building and makes color selection all the more important with varyable scoring. This creates some tough decisions and increases the pressure of overbuying.

The only downside I can think of is that it is a bit harder to explain to new players, especially those who ran away scared at simple maths.

Overall, this game has erased alhambra from the map for me. It doesn't have the expansions of alhambra, but it is a much better game straight from the box.

Tile acquisition and placement is EXACTLY like Alhambra (also money acquistion).  Now add flippable tiles and *relative* scoring rather than fixed.

First plays have provided higher scores than Alhambra, but perhaps that is due to the *tie-breaker* for determing majorities.  No more sharing.

Need more evidence to confirm, but I think this one makes me work harder at keeping track of the scoring implications of the tiles available for purchase.

Tis Alhambra with kobs on but.... Used to playing Alhambra and playing quickly but this one needs a slower play, more consideration as each tile purchase has an impact, if not for you then for your opponents. Also you can flip and increase your choice and contemplation time. However we played it without looking so missed the nuiances and so did not get as much out of it.  A different approach required for next game. Looks nice though, mind you the box is huge.

Minor scoring variant of Alhambra.  Not really worth owning both.

Alhambra on a board.  Not much reason for this to have been reimplemented, though I have to concede that double-siding the building tiles adds a layer of thinkiness.  Other than that, it's the same game.

Typical euro game that works great as a family game.

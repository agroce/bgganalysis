[ESP] Un excelente filler en el cual cada jugador debe tratar de predecir correctamente que lemming será el ganador de la carrera. Mientras más tarde apueste por el más PV consigue. Sin embargo si espera demasiado puede que la carrera acabe antes de que pueda realizar su apuesta.

The more I play this... the more I realize it's too long for what it offers. The lack of control is palatable and annoying. While its roll and move mechanic allows a deduction element... there simply isn't much there.

Ötletes és vicces játék. A tippelős mechanizmus nagyon újszerű, de túl nagy kihívást nem jelentett a győztes eltalálása (4-ből 3-an telibe találtuk), ezáltal a kártyák szerepe tűnt fontosabbnak. Nem rossz, 20 perces átvezető játéknak megteszi 2 komolyabb között:)

Grappig spelletje, waarbij je lemmings in beton laat lopen (betonblok aan been), met de mafia auto laat rijden (naar een onbekende plek), en tegelijk gokt op wie er gaat winnen of verliezen.
Bon, de puntentelling is wat simpel, maar het is zeker een grappig einde-avond spelletje.

While not 'good' with 2, it functions with 2.

This is a solid top-5 for this household.  What I like is that, with the wrong theme, even a beer-and-pretzels can be taken too seriously.  You pop-out plastic lemmings and, well, the guards come down.   

No, it's not strategically deep, but it does have the 'take that' without 'taking that' so much... and that works with everyone.  Which is where I think this game is going to sit, it just really works with everyone.

----------------------------

In hindsight, while the replayability isn't there with this game...  I really love it as a litmus test of interaction, teachability, and a game that isn't outright Ticket to Ride...  if it sucks, it's only a half-hour.

RATING: 5
As its original title states, Lemming Mafia is «not fun» indeed: it’d have all it needs to be a good filler (light theme, cute miniatures, a decent interaction among players) but its rules are so fiddly that playing it is a pain from the start.

The concept and its humourous tone are promising: were it also a bit lighter and clearer on the rules side, Lemming Mafia would surely be a much better game.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Cute filler where players are essentially betting on the results of a mafia getaway.

On each turn, a player rolls two dice, with the dice each corresponding to one of the 6 lemming mafia members.  You simply move the appropriate lemming ahead to the next open space, carrying out the action of the space it lands on.  The lemming might try speeding ahead in a getwaway vehicle, or acquire some concrete shoes (which can eventually lead to them sleeping with the fishes), and other mafia-type stuff.  Some spaces also allow you to place bets, which is how you score most of your points.  If you accurately predict the results, you'll score points at the end.

Overall, there really aren't many decisions here, but it was a cute and pleasant way to spend 20 minutes.

I played one 3 player Demo game at BGG.Con.
The lemming pawns are cute.
This game is a lot like Abandon ship, but inferior in almost every way. It's not a bad game, but there's not a lot of choices. 
The current player rolls 2 dice and moves those lemmings. He chooses which order they move in, but it usually doesn't matter.
You also get 3 goal cards at the beginning. You have opportunities to discard your goals if you don't think they'll happen.
There is a unique betting mechanism, but it wasn't enough to sell me on the game.
It might be a fun filler with my kids, but I've already got Abandon Ship.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This is a fun ultra light, ultra random roll and move game with hidden objectives. The components are very well done and the art is cute. There are a few decisions to be made but it's mostly the luck of the dice and the luck of the cards. The cards are what make this game a 6 and not a 7 for me. If you get dealt low scoring objectives at the start of the game there is no way to get new ones and you are doomed to lose. In all my games every player has scored almost identically for betting on the winning lemming. The mechanics work best with more people all going after different goals, but too many players result in too much down time.

Lemming Mafia is a quick game (30 minutes) for casual gamer.  You have to bet on the winner of the "race".  The later you bet, the more point you'll have but if you wait too much maybe you won't have time to bet and score no point.  Each player also have hidden objectives that give point if you succeed but make you lose point if you fail.  There is a lot of luck in the game, it's hard to move the lemming you need to move but it can be fun nonetheless.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This one is pretty good as a family game or filler for when you don't want something too deep. 

The Lemming minis are great looking game bits.  The board art is easy to understand once you know the few symbols on the paths.  

Gameplay can be quite chaotic.  Dice decide which of up to 2 of the lemmings you can move.  You do decide which available space in a section to put them on, however.  Strategy comes in with when you reveal which lemmings you are pulling for to win.  You have bonus point cards that pay out victory points for each condition met on them.  You generally want to keep these secret while trying to figure out which lemmings your opponents are protecting so you can give them cement overshoes.  

All in all, it can be fun.  It's not my favorite game, but I'll play whenever my friend who owns it wants to.  He brings it to game days all the time..

RATING: 7
First played November 27th, 2010. Taught in a few minutes and played in about 20 minutes with 4 players. Each person gets a set of 6 cards representing each Lemming on the board and two mission cards for extra VPs at the end of the game. The lemmings race along the track to the end and each player bets on who will win. On your turn you roll two lemming dice (each side represents one color), then you choose which lemming to move (if one is out of the race to the end then whichever lemming is in last place represents that lemming out). Lemmings are restricted to only move one 2-3 space section at a time and you can choose any unoccupied space in the next section with an avaible spot to move. Spaces on the board are get concrete (3 and they are moved out), take away concrete, bet on lemming (place one of your 6 betting cards down if you wish; want to place winner last for max points), move forward (roll dice; if lemming lands on an occupied space, they get a concrete and move back to the space the came from). When a lemming reaches the finish the game is over and lemmings get placed in that order ahead of those alread out, and discard a mission card (worth negative if you don't complete them). Each player turns over their cards and gets 1 point for every card until the get to the winning lemming card (max 6 points) Great filler game.

Lemming Mafia is a cute, little game.  It plays quickly and is simple to learn.  It's seriously all about luck.  Sure, you can pick which lemming you wish to move (unless you roll two of the same color), but you're really just doing what you're told to by the space you land on.  That being said, I still think it's pretty enjoyable.

A great game for any age over six, including adults.  Players move lemmings around a track, all the while trying to make the finish match their secret mission requirements.

this is a humorous horse race betting type game using lemmings that shouldn't be taken too seriously but has some interesting decision making in a short 20 to 30 minute game.

This a great hidden gem of a game and just fun.

Сыграли первый раз на Игротеке "Мосигры" 22 мая 2011г. Игра понравилась своим антуражем, простотой, азартом, реиграбельностью. Подумываю о её приобретении.

This quick game is fun and lighthearted.  Very luck based, but there are choices to make.  Lemming components are cool.  Those that hate luck can take a long walk off a short pier.

RATING: 6.5
An interesting light, quick betting/racing game. Kind of random, though ... but probably a decent filler.

--- Summary ---
Each player has 6 cards (1/lemming), and 2 mission cards (bonus VP at end of game). On your turn, roll two dice (sides show one of the lemming colors) then choose to move one of those lemmings (if one is out of the race, move the lemming in last place). Lemmings may move one track section at a time, to any unoccupied space in the next section. The spaces on the race track are one of several types (e.g., give a lemming concrete shoe; 2=dead, remove concrete, allow you to place bets, move a lemming, etc.). 

Betting is interesting: each time, you have the option to bet. To do so, place a lemming card face down on top of your stack of bet cards; goal is to place winner on TOP of your stack (last bet placed). 

The game ends when a lemming reaches the finish; place remaining lemmings in the order they are on the track. Mission cards score bonus VP if completed, or cost VP if failed. Then resolve bets: turn over your cards, then go through them getting 1 VP per card revealed until you get to winning lemming (max 6 VP).

A roll-and-move game with almost no control over what happens.

In this game players roll two dice that will show one of six colors of lemmings.  The player then decides which of the two lemmings shown on the dice to move to the next of a sectioned game board.  Each section has 2 or 3 spaces and each space does a different effect.  Each player also has a set of 3 different goals that they can score such as "the blue lemming finishes before the pink lemming".

There's almost no control over whether or not you can score in this game though.  Case in point, one of my goal cards was "the green lemming finishes before the red lemming" and in that game the green lemming was not rolled at all for the first 10-15 turns while the red lemming was rolled several times, sometimes with both dice showing the red lemming requiring players to move it.  Sure, there are opportunities to discard this goal to not lose points for not accomplishing it but that also takes away potential scoring opportunities that might take you out of the game anyway.  Just awful.

This is so much fun! Yes, it is a bit silly but it has great tension, the awesome art work and vibe from the "Nicht Lustig" comics and the silliness will turn this game into laughter and fun. Everybody is moving all the lemmings around, trying to get some to kill themselves and killing others off by concreting their feet, trying to bet on the right order of who dies when and how, it is so great.
If you always need a deep and complex game experience, "Lemming Mafia" will not work for you, but if you can also enjoy more light-hearted times you will get a kick out of this. And don't underestimate the tension this game creates when the lemmings you are betting on do not perform so great, it might be rough on your nails when the biting starts.

Herding lemmings to the sea (or a concrete-encased doom). Secret mission cards reward you for killing/saving certain colours. Also betting on the winner. Simple fun that doesn't outstay it's welcome.

Lemming Mafia is a boring and repetitive filler where players make wagers on luck-based events.  For what it's worth, the designer clearly worked hard to include professional touches and balancing mechanisms, but the best part of the game is simply the large rubbery lemmings.  At least your daughter can chew on them. I think the game would be improved if they were fragranced, a la Strawberry Shortcake.

I like this game. It's easy and fun.
Only disappointment are the graphics and the story. 
95% of the game is olive/ sand-color.  It looks really blunt. 
And what about lemmings wanting to kill them selfs by jumping in the water? Is that something from the cartoon?
To me it would have made more sense if there was a boat and the 'mafia'lemming that won would have escaped the police or something.

Een luchtige filler voor tussendoor.

De spelers zijn gokkers die gokken op een race tussen een aantal lemmings. Ze kunnen de race beinvloeden door betonblokken aan de lemmings vast te maken of juist weg te halen. Iedere speler moet echter ook een aantal opdrachten proberen te vervullen die ook punten op kunnen leveren.

Apuesta a cual será el Lemming que llegará primero al río. Mientras más tardes en apostar por él más PV te da. No olvides cumplir (o descartar) tus objetivos.

RATING: 5.4
I can see this as a fun multiplayer but solo it's a sloggish bore - at least with a 2x2 scenario. The planes are circling each other, occasionally climbing or diving one level, till someone gets a lucky hit in or runs out of ammo. That's it? Could work better with a custom built bomber scenario - wonder if it's worth it. (Rating for solo play)

Got unpunched copy from Kublacon 2007.  Hopefully I can teach my kid how to play this.

From BGG on 4/5/10, punched copy with the counters from General Vol 30.5 for $35 from Jay Leone.

A good effort, Mustangs suffers from the limitations of any boardgame trying to sim air combat, but it moves along nicely for the Genre.  One area where computers probably beat boards.  The expansion added more planes.

I love WWII air battle game!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Just the right amount of complexity to keep it interesting and exciting, as a dogfight should be, without too much to bog it down.  Basic game is good as an introduction, but the game to play is the advanced game, for sure.  If someone is teaching the game, might as well skip right to the advanced rules.  Multiplayer action more fun, but there can be significant downtime with inexperienced players.

Nice playable entry in the Smithsonian collection of introductory wargames.  Air combat game that worked quite well.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Mustangs is a fun little dogfight game, espcially for the enthusiast of the genre. Mustangs pays special attention the tecnical details of the planes: amount of ammo, open canopy, top speed when diving, etc. It uses a pretty simple systems for the maneuvering and altitude and so on, so the rules are clean and clever. 
 
However as a game, I find that the parts you control are really obvious and entirely under your control.. yet the dice are obviously very much out of your control and play a huge factor. So it lacks a good interplay between the chess-like maneuvers and the luck-fest dice. But despite my bluster, I'm sure a pair of middle-school kids could get a lot of payback from this classic. It's even worth revisting every so often for a modern wargamer, though I'd say it wouldn't merit much replay. I'd have to say I very much recommend Zero! for a more tense yet abstract treatment.

Unnecessarily complicated codes (what shape means what number???) push this down from a 3.5. Too few components in too big a box. GDW's Blue Max was just simpler and more fun. OK, it was WWI and this is WWII, if that's your big thing...

This is a Double set of Mustangs - 2 Complete full games in one box. Also Includes the Expansion Module from the General, and some special planes from the General that are mounted on cardboard. All parts are in excellent condition. Perfect for multiple player campaigns.

'5' if not for the Expansion. Good introductory air wargame roughly based on 'Air Force'. Scope is limited to single-seat fighters.

RATING: 6
I though this was a great game when I played a variant edition with 3D models and miniature rules.  The board game, eh... I've played far better air combat games, and far worse.  I guess this is a great game if you are seeking a simple GAMER'S game of air combat.  It's not exactly on the level of a J.D. Webster game, but it's still good clean simple fun.

RATING: N/A
I bought this because I like air combat games and I love the P-51 Mustang.  [gameid=1371] has beautiful counters and a great looking mapboard.  The only game in the Smithsonian series that was a new design.  Currently unplayed.

nice counters...simple ww2 air combat game. I would rate it higher possibly if I ever get to play it FTF....loses a lot solitaire.

RATING: 5
Never thought this was that good of an effort by CT. Basically it was Air Force / Dauntless made easier and using counters to mark moves instead of a log sheet. However, I thought a lot of the flaver of AF/DL was lost.  Some holes in the rules as well. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
The best game I have seen so far for simulating Fighter to fighter combat for World War II.  Even when playing with all the optional rules the game is not that complex and really gives you a feel for the flavor of WWII air combat.  A great game to run a campaign in.  Above score is biased due to my love of WWII fighter combat.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Pick a plane and take to the skies.  A very simple air-to-air combat game that works!  We've had battles by just drawing planes at random... makes for the occasional mismatch, but you'd be surprised how well some of those WWII fighters do against a jet!  Will never tire of playing this one.

Genki Genki Supaaa  Awesome Game!  As a fan of Airforce this game came along and replaced the clunky mechanics and made a smooth fighter to fighter game.  Easy to teach to newbies and even though the map was "stolen"  from flight leader all of the components are great.

I really liked the idea of the game, but the size of the hexes in the map makes playing with the counters provided impossible, i.e. either the counters are too big or the hexes are way too small
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Can be quite fun playing a multi-player game with experienced players. I have only played the adaptation for miniatures and it works quite well, you use a giant hex map and you don't have that usual fiddly measuring you get with miniatures. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Production looks good, but end result doesn't feel like aerial combat, and some aircraft statistic decisions seem really strange. Needs a few more plays, but I don't think this is the Holy Grail WWII fighter game I'm looking for.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A good lightweight air war game. It doesn't do much for a hard-core simulation of actual air combat, but the modeling of individual characteristics of the planes is quite good, although hard to decipher without the play aids. 

The weight and number of components makes it great for play on the lawn in the summertime

RATING: 10
This game gave me one of the best gaming experiences I could wish for.
I taught a friend how to play it.  I had a couple of A6M2 Zeros and he had a pair of Wildcats.
The game ended with 1 kill each side (2 kills total) My last Zero was barely flying with damage in every area of the plane. We were both out of ammo.
He won but barely...
The best part of this intense game we played was when I looked up at him at the end of the game.  The look on his face was priceless and he said, "that was a total adrenaline rush"!
He wanted to play again immediately.  After half dozen more games or so he was ready to go find and buy a copy for himself.
He was hooked on a new hobby after that and I am the guy who introduced him to wargaming.
Mustangs and it's expansion always gets a 10 from me, just for that.

Good lightweight air combat game.  Graphics still hold up, quick playing system, seems a bit easy though to get off snapshots with the "Tight Turn" maneuver.  Initiative chit is critical in close in situations.

Also, seems to be fairly easy to disengage/avoid combat by climbing/diving out of range due to the way initiative is determined.

One of the better air combat games that I've tried, like this better than the current "Wings of War".

RATING: 7
Not a bad little game. Takes some getting used to, and many would find a computer sim more fun. But the system works and captures the feel of air combat, the capabilities of the different planes. I'm not an air buff, so this is probably all the air-combat game I'll ever need or want. Happy with it so far.

Pleasant surprise. Very playable air combat game that moves quickly and can be explained to a new player in short order. Impulse movement is excellent and not found in many light air combat games. Not complex, even with optional rules (including those from General). My only complaint is that the shapes and colors to denote maneuvers are not at all intuitive. This game cries for aircraft data cards and a better player aid.

My rating went up after a few plays, and I'm working on aircraft data cards to make this more accessible.

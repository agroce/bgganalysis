The meditative, contemplative qualities of this game could with the bright colors, simple-yet-challenging play and the many built-in expansions make this one a true solitaire winner. This should really be rated higher.

7-21-15: I won my first game, which gave me the false impression that this game wasn't too, too difficult. And then I lost my next seven games (and counting). I thought I had a good strategy going, but I'm still trying to figure it out. Not sure how great this is as a two player co-op, but it's a fun, fast solitaire card game.

UPDATE 9-27-15: I've played it a LOT more in the past two months. In fact, it's quickly become the most played game in my collection. After my first ten plays, I got a better handle on strategy and have probably won 65-70% of my games since that first difficult start. The expansions definitely make the game easier, but they add some variety, too. This is a very solid game.

Onirim is a classic solo game for a reason. It took me until my fourth play to finally beat the difficult sequencing of cards -- and those nightmares! What a nightmare. It's an enjoyable puzzle, and I'm looking forward to starting to mix the expansions in now that I've snagged a win.

The one downside to this game is that there's an awful lot of shuffling, and you'll need to pull out an expansion after each time you play with it (unless you find a combo of expansions that you plan on playing with every single time). A fun little game, but [b][thing=206061][/thing][/b] is still my top solo game.

Players say that to play well you need to count cards, and, well, that's a little too much commitment for me personally, as it's not exactly what I'm looking for in a solo game. Still, this one is an interesting puzzle that was interesting for several plays.

I'd still be interested in trying this one two-player with my wife, if I could convince her to learn a new game.

Os componentes são de altíssima qualidade e o visual do jogo é muito atraente. O jogo base é fácil mesmo nas primeiras partidas, mas as expansões melhoram muito nessa sensação. O maior problema de design do jogo é a quantidade de vezes que se deve embaralhar as cartas durante uma partida.

Onirim is the solitaire game I have been looking for.

Numerous reshuffling is the only complain I have (sleeves are a must).

базовая игра по сути на подсчёт числа ключей каждого цвета (в сбросе и на столе). 
если кошмарами сбрасывать руку/колоду слишком часто, карты в колоде закончатся слишком быстро.

The game comes with a lot of content and top noch components. One of the most gorgeous box i've seen so far.
Unfortunately, the game is not as fun as you could expect it. I find it less interesting than urbion, for example. 

And the big problem: all cards don't have exactly the same size, so while you shuffle the decks, those cards keep sticking together. And that's a problem because this game is a lot about shuffling, and there's no chance sleeved cards could fit inside the gorgeous box.

Traded. Down(up?)graded to the small boxed first edition. While I loved having so many expansions in one box, most of them were not played, and the ones I liked was in the first edition. Also I'm not a big fan of the inserts.

The best solo game. Small footprint, quick set up and playing time, expandability and the tension lasts until the end of the game.

Wonderful little game played solo or with a partner, you are attempting to escape some little mage by finding four pairs of colored doors before the Nightmares can thwart you, and there are seven mini expansions in this new game which you can mix and match at will to provide a large amount of additional variety to the experience. The surreal artwork and story make this a joy for most ages, and I like that the designer keeps the aesthetics consistently unique through all his games. Amazing, you really feel the theme of wandering about, no matter how abstract it might seem. Will be buying his new stuff when it comes out.

Many people say it's boring and repetitive. 
Once you understand the rules and strategy, it does get's very simple to win. I usually play with 2 expansions, sometimes 3. 

If you like to raise the difficult level a bit I would recommend to use "The book of steps lost and found" and 'Crossroads and Dead ends". I am almost always playing with the "Tower" extension, too.

By the end of the day, it's a simple game. It's great as an in-between solo game. I can recommend it but don't expect any wonders.

I was ultimately a bit disappointed in this one because I really like Zee Garcia from the Dice Tower, and he really really enjoys this game.  So I basically hyped this game for myself beyond what it is meant to be.  As a solitaire style game, it really is very good and offers some compelling choices, but I lost interest in it after a few playthroughs.  I know it is a good game for its style, and that's why I gave it a 6.  I don't know how much I'll be interested in playing it again myself though.  Maybe sometime.

Started with the physical set, now more likely to whip out the digital version for on the go gaming.

-----------------------
This one was about what I expected.  The base game probably doesn't offer much in terms of replayability, but its a fun light weight co-op game.  The true test on this one is throwing some of the expansions in, so still have lots to explore on this one.

I really enjoy putting on some new-agey music and getting into Onirim.  Here's what I like about it:


-The dreamy theme
-The quality of the box and it's components
-The expansions, which add a lot of replay value and work together in fun and interesting ways. 


There is, however, a lot of shuffling. I don't actually mind the shuffling while I'm playing, but I do worry that the cards will suffer in the long run.  This is perhaps an unfounded worry, as I haven't noticed any major drops in quality after quite a few plays, but time will tell.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Fantastic game! Small, portable, fast setup and play, abstract art, fresh theme. This is the only game I own that I want to take with me and play when I have some downtime outside of the house. The art is so fitting and non-geekish so I don't feel like a goober if I am playing at a coffee shop. There is a lot of shuffling, but I think it adds to the feeling of being in a maze and searching for the door to freedom, so it is not a burden, but another level of immersion. I can't wait for my cards to get nice and worn in.
The expansions included in game really change things up and add complexity. So much can change with the addition of a few extra cards.
My six year old gamer daughter loves it and we play the two player mode together. She asked me to play tonight, so we've got a winner here.
Love, love, love this game #shadifanboy

Simple solo card game. I played it only on mobile app and I think it's perfect for a mobile game - I wouldn't buy the box version. First of all, I don't play board games solo but secondly I think this one is too random to invest time for setup/shuffling and so on. On app single play takes up to 5min total. I am not saying this game does not require any strategy. It does, and I can see I'm getting better when playing it. It's just that a lot depends on card draw and even best performance can be wrecked by bad luck.

Solo game. Set collection, hand managing.
Never tried the 2-played co-op variant and don't intend to. 

Cons:
Box too small to hold sleeved cards.

Pros: 
7 Exp. included in game.
Lot of variety in one box.
Challenging enough.
Stunning packaging, like all its Oniverse sibblings.

This and Friday were the two games that were recommended most when I asked about solo games on /r/boardgames.

I was able to find 7 of the 8 doors on my first play of the base game. I think if I played better (and used my keys to reorder the deck towards, the end, instead of to avoid nightmares) I might have had a chance to win.

I like this game, but it feels like there's a lot of shuffling.

Got the iOS app for $1. So far, I've won 2 of 4 games. The app doesn't have any of the expansions, though.

I think I don't pay as much attention to the game when playing on my phone - there's something about being able to look at the deck remaining to better get an idea of the strategy.

I'm not really one for playing solo games, I have better things to do when alone, however, the app implementation on this is fantastic and the solo game plays out with no fiddliness and in about the amount of time I want to devote to it.

The coöp game is clever with it's shared hand aspect and is a relaxing game.

The expansions are what makes the game. The variety of ways to play offer different ways to approach the game and add variety.

The more I learn about this one, the more I like it. Got another play through in, and it left me wanting to play again. 

There are more decisions to make than meets the eye at first. There's more depth than I originally thought.

I am not big into solo gaming, but I've always liked the art of the Oniverse and have been intrigued by all 4 games since they offer short play time and seem to be very replayable given the expansions that are typically included with each game. This one intrigued me the most since it is entirely played with a deck of cards. As you play you go through the deck trying to find keys or collect sets of the same color to unlock the 8 doors all while avoiding the nightmares. The nightmares make you remove cards from the game in a variety of ways which is of course bad because when your deck is out of cards you lose. 

Overall I was really impressed with how the game played and really gave you some tough decisions about how to handle the nightmares to determine what to discard and what cards to play. You want to play cards of the same color to unlock a door, but the symbols must be different with each card so it is a little puzzle with each card you play, and it really hurts when you have to play a card that breaks up your current set that is in progress. I have not played with any of the 9 expansions yet but in 2 games I  have lost one and won one.

If your friends are too busy to play games with you or if you're thinking of a solo activity that you would like to do at home, this amazing solitaire game is the best idea to have in your collection. 

I just love how the game looks aesthetically appealing from the cards to the box and rulebook. 

The game and each expansion were able to draw me away from my video games and onto the tabletop. The theme is amazing and I always enjoyed shuffling the cards although I guess it will require sleeves because of how much worn out the cards were.

It's a very simple game but with better management and decision-making based on the brilliant mechanic and awesome ideas of forming your labyrinth and dealing with card mitigation by either losing special cards or depleting your deck of cards which you need to get all the eight doors.

Of all the expansions, I really like the glyphs, the towers, crossroads and dead ends, and the dreamcatcher expansions.

I have a somewhat complicated set of feelings toward Onirim. I find I generally much prefer Sylvion to Onirim, but I play Onirim far more often. 
The "key" to a good Onirim strategy lies in knowing how to use keys. During good games, the keys are an apt, but sparse defense against the oncoming nightmares, but during a bad game, there's nothing one can do to stop the onslaught. A good or bad game depends completely on how the cards are shuffled. My first five or ten (or twenty...) games were mostly crapshoots as I realized that trashing a key for a prophecy is not ALWAYS the right choice. Once I found my own rhythm of keeping/discarding/playing, the game became tense, gripping, and most importantly a lot of fun. But again, if the cards come out just right (or perhaps WRONG) there's so little one can do to win the game. Maybe this is what makes the game so tense--one can never KNOW their strategy is airtight. Everything could go wrong in just a few consecutive nightmare draws. However, during the really, HORRENDOUSLY bad games, there is no fun or satisfaction for me. Usually I am a rather agreeable player--win or lose, I'm just happy to be playing. With Onirim, this is decidedly not the case. After the first ten or fifteen cards, and all I have in my hand are sun cards, the rage starts settling in. By the time the end of the game is nearing and it's becoming apparent that the cards I would need to win are all sitting in the discard pile, I am ready to quit and never touch the game again. This makes the bad games overall quite sour experiences for me. 
I always come back to the game, though. The mechanics are elegant, making the gameplay intuitive and natural, but also making sure the tension is always present. This is why I say my feelings are somewhat complicated. I love the look and the feel of Onirim, but I definitely do not ALWAYS enjoy playing.

Probably my favorite solo game.  This is not for everyone--my husband, upon seeing the game-play, immediately declared that this is a game he wouldn't enjoy.  For me, however, it is a very zen experience that lets me zone out and relax for a bit.  If you're someone who enjoys Tetris you might like this game. I still haven't gone through all the expansions. The fact that there are 7 of them adds lots of variety to the game-play.

My go-to short solo game.  I love how it presents you with a constant stream of tough decisions to make, where you can weigh the odds but are never guaranteed of anything.  It always seems to come down to the last few cards, regardless of whether you win or lose.

Even without expansions, I will never get tired of this.  But there are so many expansions, and they all work together in interesting ways! 

Currently, I like Happy Dreams and Dark Premonitions, Crossroads and Dead Ends, and The Door to the Oniverse.  I didn't really like the Towers, and the Book of Steps Lost and Found.  Haven't tried the other two.

It's an ok solo game. The rules are simple enough and the game has a decent amount of luck mitigation. The need to constantly shuffle the deck of cards makes it a bit tedious to play as it's mostly fiddling with cards vs actually playing the game. The second edition comes with some interesting modules to add in that make the game a bit more challenging.

I am a big fan of Onirim. I nthe original edition, then upgraded to this one. The new expansions are nice, but not essential.  The pawn is cool looking but rather useless gameplay wise, and feels like justification to pump up the MSRP price point for the game.
 
However, this new edition is a nice package for people who don't own Onirim, and I'm looking forward to the forthcoming new games in the Oniverse line. 

UPDATE Jan 2015:
Onirim has become my go-to solo game for when I'm stuck somewhere with a little time to kill.  I like the way the various expansions can be played in isolation or together.  Each of them adds more to think about, but is well balanced in adding both harmful and helpful elements.  I was working towards an "all-in" game with all the expansions, but I now don't think that's the best way to enjoy the game.  I keep the glyphs mixed in and choose one or max two other expansions each time.  I enjoy the way the game has a different feel and requires different strategies each time this way.

For a solitaire card game, Shadi Torbey has come up with some simple but original mechanisms.  This doesn't feel like anything else.   The art and presentation are amazing.    The challenge is definitely there, and the tension ramps up as the deck thins.   There is a lot of shuffling, as almost everybody else has mentioned.   Haven't tried the expansions yet or the 2p mode.

Nice little time-waster that has a pretty decent split of win/lose.  As far as quick solitaire games go, I find this is much better to play than Friday.

While the 2nd edition is beautiful, the cards aren't the greatest and one of my nightmare cards came with a massive chip on the back.  This game could benefit from sleeving, but there is no tolerance in the box to do so, and it'd be a shame to replace the insert since it's so nice.

Trying to understand the rules with 2 players was a nightmare. The rulebook contradicts multiple rules when trying to explain how it works with 2 people. Maybe this is mainly designed as a one player game, I don't know, regardless it was very frustrating learning from scratch when going by the rule book. Theme doesn't really make sense. On a brighter note I enjoyed the artwork.

**edit**

Much smoother as a one player solitaire style game. Enjoyed this MUCH more solo.

This game keeps growing on me. Only about 15 plays, so far, and most of those were wins no less. This featherweight solitaire game is a minimum investment with good returns if you’re looking for distraction. Whereas a game like “Friday” is a grueling flogging, Onirim is gentle, and almost meditative. I have yet to try any of the expansions however, as I’m still getting familiar with the base game. Not bad.

One complaint I do have is the quality of the card stock, which is poor considering a) what I paid b) how many times you have to shuffle in a single game. They should have done better.

One of the (perhaps THE) greatest solo games I've ever played. Quick, simple, surprisingly deep, elegant, charming... Right now I'm exploring Sylvion and Castellion, the designer's next two games, but before that and after I purchased this one, there wasn't a SINGLE day in which I didn't pull Onirim out of the shelf to play at least ONE game of it. It's just that good. The extra expansions make it even better.

Nice game with a deceptive amount of depth but simple to follow rules. Equally as good for co-operative or solo play.

Art work is slightly dark, which I really like. Elise Plessis really did a fantastic job.

Several variants are included in the box,

[b]The book of steps lost and found:[/b] Interesting variant where you need to obtain the doors in the correct order. You get three new powers which remove cards from your discard pile for powerful effects. Really enjoyed this variant and will probably play it more.
[b]the glyphs:[/b] As with the keys of the base game the glyphs offer another way of obtaining doors without playing three cards, and offer an additional symbol from which to make your three cards to unlock a door. Interesting as it seems to make the game slightly easier.
[b]the dreamcatchers: [/b] Unplayed
[b]the towers: [/b] Unplayed
[b]happy dreams and dark premonitions: [/b]Unplayed
[b]crossroads and dead ends: [/b] Interesting variant. The multicolour cards are a really nice addition and I do like the 'dead ends which clog up your hand, but overall this variant is a little bland
[b]door to the oniverse: [/b] Only played the once on the app and it seems a little complicated for very little gain. Each of the characters gives you a special ability but that ability is not obvious and thus I keep having to check and double check the rules.

I predict it will be a 6 after 10 plays of the base game.
There are 7 in-box expansions that could keep the rating high.

I tend to like co-ops with good mechanics, and I also enjoy games with combos and complexity. But I can't always play those kinds of games, which is why Onirim is a solid little game.

15 minutes including set-up gets you a nice little challenge with some decent tension. The game is based on set-collection with a but of optional deck-manipulation. Nice.

A drawback is the game calls for a lot of shuffling, and adding more expansions adds cards to the deck, but it's honestly not that bad and actually feels pretty relaxing.

I should also note this game plays really well with a partner.  The usage of a personal hand, a shared hand, and the ability to swap cards between the two is really excellent and promotes teamwork.

Incredible solo card game. The art in the game is quite amazing.
I love it. I tried a couple of time the 2 player version with my wife but it didn't work for us.
Plenty of replayability with the 7 expansions in the box.

The only downsides are you need to reshuffle a lot and most importantly, the black border of the cards.

After getting burned by Silvion I became very reluctant to try any other games in the Oniverse so when I found this on Steam for free I thought it worth trying. It's actually rather good and I've enjoyed gradually exploring, mixing and matching the expansions into the base game. I'm tempted to go out and buy a physical copy but the sheer amount of in game shuffling puts me off.

RATING: 5
Nice art, interesting theme, but at its core it's a crushingly boring solo card game where "mastery" is a soporific concoction of card-counting, push-your-luck, and... shuffling. Lots of shuffling. The expansions layer bits of rules & challenges on top of it, but there are *so* many better solo games than this one now. Hard to recommend.

Very easy to play. Expansions add complications but have enough ways to moderate your circumstances that it all balances out. The game is not about losing a lot.

RATING: 8.8
This summer, I've decided to play 1 expansion per day till I've played them all. Base Game: [8/10] I've been playing this for years now, and my win ratio is decent, above 60% on the app. Expansion 1: [8/10] The Book of Steps Lost and Found. I like this one a lot. It is harder than the base game, for sure. Expansion 2: [9/10] The Glyphs. This is my favorite expansion so far: adds doors, but glyphs mitigate this. Expansion 3: [6/10] The Dreamcatchers. I like the idea of this one a LOT, but I found the gameplay a bit too easy. Expansion 4: [7/10] The Tower. This is my least favorite one yet, not because it isn't good, but because it is so hard. I haven't beaten it. Expansion 5: [7/10] Happy Dreams and Dark Premonitions. Played this one twice; it is fairly easy to mitigate the premonitions with dreams, such that I was basically just playing the basic game again. Expansion 6: [8/10] Crossroads and Dead Ends. The crossroads cards are neat--LIFESAVERS if you combine expansions. Expansion 7: [9/10] The Door to the Oniverse. Wow! 8 (2 of each, so 16) characters with individualized abilities! Grand Onirim: [8/10] Today, I combined all 7 expansions for a grand, hour-long game (+15 minutes of sorting cards before and after...). As a plus, somehow I won. Maybe I missed a few rules (possible--there's a lot).

Physical game, 6.2. iOS version 7.4 and might go higher if the game shows that it has legs. The iOs version of this game is great and really solves the problem of the original game, which is finding the doors in the deck when getting three in a row of a single color and all the shuffling. This game is the perfect time killer now. Great for a plane ride, or waiting for your doctor's/dentist's appointment.

I was really excited to try this in the app ... and was underwhelmed.  I've probably played a dozen times, and just don't find it interesting or fun, even with the Glyphs expansion.  There's no sense of strategy or ability to control your fate, being completely at the mercy of the shuffle.  I can't imagine playing the physical copy and shuffling so much!  For now, I'll keep the app for when I only have time for a very short game, but I can easily see myself deleting it, too...

Favourite packaging of any game I have. Really interesting co-op, plays at that nice boundary between simple gameplay and plenty of decisions. So many different expansions leads to lots of replayability. Nice difficulty, slightly towards the easy side but some of the expansions turn it up a good notch. Really a relaxing game to close a night off once people trickle out.

Love the artwork for this game: super fitting and pleasing to look at.

When I first played the first edition of Onirim, I don't think I was in the right place to enjoy what it had to offer (partially because I was a terrible shuffler!). After having played great little solo games such as Friday, Sylvion, and Pocket Civ, I've decided that maybe the issue wasn't with the game but rather with me. So re-approaching Onirim with an appreciation of the small, subtle, but meaningful decisions that it offers had yielded a far greater appreciation -- as it delivers this in spades. 

Opening doors to travel safely through the dream world couldn't be more aesthetically pleasant (the art has undergone a minor facelift in the second edition) -- nor filled with reverie-esque ripples of probability that require gentle but constant management (i.e., when to force a reshuffle, when to burn cards to manage threats, etc.).

I've only added a few expansions so far, I'm really appreciating the ways in which they interweave to create a velvety texture -- the seams of where the base game and individual expansions don't seem so clear, obvious, or even necessary.

Thankfully, Shadi Torbey has also included variants for increased challenge (if/when I get there).

Why the heck do I love this game so much? The more I play it, the more it grabs me. The artwork is beautiful. It's super easy to learn and teach. I love that I can play it solo or with someone and surprisingly, I think I prefer it solo, though I enjoy the two-player game. At first play, the game seems completely random, but after a few games it's apparent that there's more to it, and the different ways to manipulate the deck become clear. I'm always up for a game or two of this, especially with the included expansions. It's quickly become one of my favourites.

Definitely a unique solo experience. The Nightmare cards make the game exciting, and you really do have to strategize on how you'll conserve your key cards. Haven't played 2 player yet, but it seems like it'd be a completely different experience (especially if you play silently, as the rulebook suggests). 

Edit: 2 Plays is much more difficult (especially if you can't talk) because it's hard to tell when the other player is conserving cards and strategist. Still lots of fun, and a great quick game.

I may have more plays than I have logged. Played with 6 of the 7 expansions at least once. But always on their own. I'm pretty sure I've won around 75 percent of the time (maybe 50%[but even that's to much]) (constantly checking the rules to make sure I'm playing correctly after always winning) and the times I lost; was very close to winning. I'm sure if you added multiple expansions it would make it challenging but for some reason it bothers me that I have to do that to make it tough. That being said, I'll probably give it another shot one day but right now I have no desire to. It is a nice little package though, from box, rules, artwork, and quality.

The new version of Onirim works great as a solo game. I'm not a fan of the way the luck of the draw can sometimes be the biggest challenge to winning, but what I do enjoy is the complexities of the expansions. By adding these in, players have to be much more calculated with their risk management as they explore the deck.

The theme is also top-notch. The art helps tremendously in making players feel like they are exploring a dreamscape when going through the deck, but the game mechanics also lend themselves to being lost in a maze with a confusing set of goals needed to escape.

It works fine as a two-player co-op game, but it definitely seems designed as a solo experience. 

It is currently the one solo game I have in my collection (and will be until I find something more interesting for one player).

I was looking for a solo game that could travel well, and my wife picked this one up for me for Christmas. The rules aren't explained overly well, but after watching a playthrough on youtube I quickly picked it up. Fun, quick game that usually goes down to the last few cards before the game is decided. The new version comes with 7(!) expansions. At this point, I've played with three of them and they enhance the game - some of the others seem a bit complicated (each card has a different effect) so I will tackle them down the road. In the meantime, if you're looking for a lightweight, solo game that you can bring into work with you or throw in a suitcase, then this one should fill that need.

A soothing way to spend some time, distract yourself, and clear your head a bit. Some of the expansions don't sit well with me though, feeling a bit tacked-on and convoluted. However, some of them REALLY improve the game, to the point that I doubt I'll ever play the vanilla version again.

Edit: Sold. After about 20 plays, I just didn't have the patience for it anymore. I still think it's a fantastic game though, and bumped up my score a bit. If you consider yourself a collector of the best of the best, Onirim should probably be on your shelf.

Only played ipad app version. Fun little solo time-killer, but a little too dependent on luck of the draw, and it's going to take luck to beat my best game. Not sure I'd play physical version at all. WELL worth $.99 on the iOS store though.

Very quick in nearly every aspect. I can pull it out of the box, play, and clean it up within 30 minutes. 

The only level of fiddliness or downtime is with the frequent shuffling of the deck you'll end up doing. 

I've played the first few expansions that this came with:

"The Book of Steps Lost and Found" - Very challenging, and a nice twist to mix things up a bit.

"The Glyphs" - Thought this would make the game much easier. But it really doesn't. It's about the same in challenge, but just another layer of options added. A nice addition. I may want to play it more though.

"The Dreamcatchers" - This one I had a hard time picking up. at first. I don't think I really liked it that much. It took it from a very clean game into some fairly choking steps.

"The Crossroads and Dead Ends"  - Probably my favorite expansion so far. Super powerful and super helpful cards paired with some atrocious cards that clog up the flow. But it's very satisfying to navigate around these obstacles. 

Overall, I feel the rulebooks could use a little improvement with designating which cards are *not* expansion cards by showing the symbol in the book. This is important for when learning how to play and what to shuffle. in and I feel the expansions could use a little bit clearer wording on some things, or to rehash examples. Pretty minor rulebook complaints though.

I like that you can play solitaire as well as 2-player co-op just as effectively with this game.. however there is just too much shuffling required...

The base game is simple but you can feel your decisions matter. There is a bit of card counting and your choices are quite simple but their consequences really make you win or lose the game so you can feel the depth. While I haven't explored them much the expansions seem to add more depth to the game so it is nice to have them come with the game. I like this as a nice and fast solo. After the app came out I noticed I would rather play that so sold.

RATING: 8
While discovering this game, the first travel you'll go through the labyrinth of dreams is the box opening.
Getting to the game components is like opening a succession of doors that lead to other doors.

The core rules are quite simple but you've got to pay attention to some details that might make the game harder or easier if not played correctly (hand redraw when discarded to defeat a nightmare, no two symbols similar side by side, whatever their color)

After a few plays, the core game will easily defeated and the seven and a half included expansions will provide new challenges to face.

The most annoying part is the card quality.
Paper is sufficiently thick and rigid, so that's not a problem but the cards are too "glossy".
So, they tend to snap to each other making them difficult to shuffle which is quite annoying in a game when you have to do it frequently.

I adore this game for 2 players. I don't care for it so much solo just because I don't like shuffling and this game requires more shuffling than any game I've ever played. It also has several intriguing expansions and a standalone app.

RATING: 7
Great way to zone out, focus your mind, and relax.  This game is relaxation incarnate, and a lot more fun than solitaire.  With two players it becomes a tad confusing, but still relatively simple to overcome.  Without expansions it's too easy, luckily this version comes with 7 of them.  So you have lots of variety.

Not bad. Onirim is a "advanced" version solitaire compared to standard deck solitaire games. Its therefore more interesting game, but one minor issue is, that you have to go through the deck many times to find the right card in a one game AND after that shuffle rhe deck again before you can continue.

Onirim 2nd Edition is a well designed card game with insane replayability with 7 included expansions you can combine in any way. I play this game solo as I think it's the best way to play it. The set-up time and length of a single game makes it a great option for quick solo gaming sessions. I love cards game, but the amount of shuffling is pretty high and the deck can be big with several expansions early game. The free app is a good way too play when not at home and having time to kill.

Excellent solitaire game, especially when played on the app which takes care of the main criticism (the constant reshuffling of cards).  The art/style is what attracted me in the first place, but what brings me back is the relaxing play.  It's quick, and perfect to take a quick break and then dive back into whatever it is one is doing.  Really not very different in feeling from most solitaire card games except for the looks, and that has been a classic way to pass time for many people a long time for a reason.

Comparing it to Solitaire is hardly fair. Only the alternating-suits mechanic from Solitaire really remains. The game otherwise differs drastically: all cards go in a single long run, and instead of hunting for aces to begin your scoring piles with, you're hunting for 8 doors. You encounter foes which can be dealt with in a variety of ways, as well as special cards which enhance your strategies. This is all before I even get to the 7 built-in expansions, all of which can greatly change the feel of the game. There is a lot of setup and shuffling involved, and it might take up a decent amount of table space, but these are my ONLY complaints about this game. High replayability, good for solo or co-op, and well worth picking up.

Very unique theme, but the artwork makes it a little dark, and a bit off-putting for me personally. I think after a few plays onirim could become a bit samey, but then again it's a little more random and not quite as puzzle solvey as Friday. So i guess it could end up being a little more replayable. Between the two, I think I like Friday a little more due to its theme.

A good friend got this for me for my birthday based on my wishlist on the geek (note to self: update wish list).

I've played a few times so far (in a pair).  It's cute with nice artwork.  We did find it quite difficult to win.

Solo play is quite good though this is not normally my thing. I might try solo a few more times. I wish the edges of the cards would not get scuffed so easily (perhaps black borders are not the best choice).

Every game is tense. As for discard pile, There are two ways conceivable to handle it. Whether allowing to check it or not. App version is the former. IMO not checking rule is also good, but it probably becomes too hard depending on the combination of expansions.

I'm not very suprised by how you need to go through the deck about one million times per play, in order to find specific cards. There should be a better system or mechanism for that.

RATING: 9
One of the best quick solo games, made even better with the second edition. Lightning fast, and the sweet iOS version is even quicker still. The port makes it the quintessential super-fast solitaire game, as you can get a game played in a few minutes. So my rating of 9 is more or less with the app, otherwise it'd probably be a bit lower (8+ or so), as the games would take longer. 

It's not the deepest of games, but it simply puts me in the Zone. Relaxing.

RATING: 5
Having only played the solo version in order to learn the rules, I wouldn't mind trying Onirim again in cooperation with another player, but I can't see myself having the desire to do so over most games. To put it simply, the rules work and the box/components are pretty and... that is all.

The gameplay all comes down to probability on card draws and the truckload of mini-expansions bundled in the box are only there to complicate the calculations. Improving at the game is a tricky beast though, because not only will you often be mislead by making the correct move to have the slightly less likely scenario punish you, but also the actual consequences of bad things aren't felt before the very end game where the deck depletes. So you end up in a situation where playing does a poor job at teaching you the game and you therefore decide to solve the decision making before playing (by learning the exact contents of each suit by heart and tracking that information). And then inflict a couple of random expansions at a time on yourself so that you have to re-evaluate that pre-game assessment each time. During the game itself, you're unfortunately more or less confined to the realm of the expected.

As a side-note, the amount of shuffling might be quite a deal breaker to many.

RATING: 5
Hm. I think that this game is overblown.  Given the reviews, I was quite excited to play it. Basically it is an abstract game.  There are allusions to being trapped in a dream, and the artwork is cool...it's just that the artwork gets very repetitive within the game...and there isn't any reason to pay attention to it.  The game is all about colors and symbols...only not really because it's basically about "same vs. different."  The only symbol that needs to actually be paid attention to is the "key."

And there is a ridiculous amount of shuffling, which I kind of like on a thematic level, and hate on a practical level.

Also the game just isn't that difficult. There is the luck of the draw factor, so you'll never win 100% of the time, but a very few strategies will get you over 50% pretty quickly.  Don't initiate a 3-color lineup unless you already have the cards in your hand (or know they are coming). Discard cards when you've got 2 doors of that color. Make judicious use of the "keys" to organize the upcoming cards. Have a vague sense of which colors have the most discards.

The big upside to this game is that it is quick. 15 minutes tops, and ZERO set up time.  Keep it next to the computer, and if you are bored enough to binge surf, then why not play a few rounds of Onirim instead?

Note: The above comment doesn't take into consideration the expansions.  I'll try a few, but I'm not expecting to be wowed.

Initial Review: 8.75

Edit: Onirim is my most played modern game (due to it being a solo game), but mainly because any time I play it, I play it twice. I'm better at this game than Friday, but I feel like the choices in Friday have more consequences, whereas Onirim has more luck mechanics with the cards drawn.

Edit 2: A much better app than a card game. Lots and lots of shuffling.

[Shared Copy]
Pretty heavy on luck, but persistance and practise will yield fun strategies and some tense gameplay.  The artwork and theme are great. 
Here is a quick review of each expansion:

The Book of Steps Lost and Found (9.5/10) - Essential. The goal cards force you to strategize when opening doors, and the spells help to mitigate the difficulty of that task. The vague iconography on the spell card is the only drawback. 

The Glyphs (9.0/10) - Essential.  This expansion somewhat mitigates a lot of the luck of the base game by adding more strategic and tactical choices.  This should be a permanent addition to the base game.

The Dreamcatchers (9.5/10) - Essential. The overload contingency increases tension and strategizing opporunities, and the failsafe book cards are a good counterpoint. I also feel that the "freeing" and "search" mechanics help keep the game from seizing up. The only downside is that with the number of options, there really should exist a reference card similar to the spell card in TBOSLAF.  

The Towers (6.5/10) - For me, this was the most difficult of the expansions. Working out the combination of towers is very uninteresting and clunky in practise. Very little replay value. 

Happy Dreams and Dark Premonitions (5/10) - The conditional effects of the premonitions offer some strategic options. However, they also exacerbate the randomness of the game. The happy dreams help combat this, but only for certain premonition combinations. The vague iconography on the dark premonition cards isn't very helpful, either. 

Crossroads and Dead Ends (8.5/10) - The idea of dead ends filling your hand, closing in around the player, is a really well-implemented and thematic concept. The crossroads are a nice 'wild card' addition. This expansion by itself might be a little too easy for more seasoned players.

The Door to the Oniverse (5.5/10) - If you have good card management, half the Denizens that you purchase usually never see play. When they are used, I feel that most of them are way too overpowered. Also, the lack of proper iconography makes it frustrating to tell what the function of each Denizen is. 

The Little Incubus (6/10) - Technically not an expansion, but a supplemental player aid for the base game. Fine for beginners, but I feel that most players wouldn't miss out on much if they just skipped it.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]Onirim is a fun solo game and an excellent game design, but I very rarely play games solo and if I do it's usually something heavier. Onirim has stayed in the collection because my daughter loves it and looking back I'd probably pick this over Sylvion because it plays so quick and set up is a breeze.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]- Similar to Sylvion this game has great art, it's really evocative of a surreal, dream like place.
- Very simple game play, but it plays so fast that it holds up well to repeated play. 
- 7 expansions, I've yet to play with any of them, but they seem to add a lot of variety and challenge to the game play. This game could keep you busy for a while.
- Be aware that this game requires a lot of shuffling which is part of the reason Sylvion has seen more plays, plus I prefer the tower defense style game as opposed to the more standard card play of Onirim. 
- This has been a surprise hit with my older daughter (10), she's probably already played 30+ times.[/i]

A great game to be sure. The base game is easy to pick up and play with many expansions to change the flavour of the game. I really enjoy the solo but my wife and I love playing the 2 player game! 

It is also a relaxing card game in the evening to disconnect from technology before bedtime! At the end of the day I want to be immersed in a light strategy game. The symbols mean I don't have to read a bunch of text on cards too. A significant bonus after a long day at work.

After about a 100 plays I'm finding the cards are showing some wear on the corners in particular. Wish they made the higher quality cards. That is the only reason I gave a 9 instead of a ten. My daughter who is only 7 years old loves to play this game with me. I do the shuffling and she does the thinking and she even wins!

Have you ever caught yourself spending 2hours playing solitaire on your computer, ending up feeling bad for yourself?

Onirim is the answer. The same addictive feeling, with more class and dignity!

At first I was afraid it wouldn't suceed in that and when I saw a playthrough where the deck was resuffled 4 times in one minute I run for the hills. 

Luckily I managed to give it a chance and thank God for that.

Does exactly what it promises. A prestigious and fullfiling solitaire game!

This game is a very satisfying and very difficult game. I have only played it solo as of yet and I have like 1 win in 8 games. With 7 expansions coming in the box, this has crazy replay-ability. Pick it up if you are a fan of solo games. I don't think you will be disappointed.

EDIT: I have played this game many many many times. I must say I enjoy playing it more using the app now, because it does all of the shuffling for you. However, this game is fantastic either way you play it. If you are open to playing solo games, this is a must have.

A beautiful new edition of this game. The only thing that would have made it better would have been linen finish cards and a bigger box for sleeving cards. The artwork has been updated and improved and the icons are even better than before.

Here are my thoughts as I play through the expansions:

[b]Expansion 1: Book of Steps - Lost and Found[/b] - This one adds difficulty to the game in that you now have to get doors in a specific order. Sounds impossible, right? Well, to fix that, they give you a spell card with 3 things you can do. When you discard (x) number of cards (depending on the spell) from your discard pile, you get to do a powerful move. It makes the game easier and more difficult all at once. I like this expansion, but I don't often play with it. 7/10


Not sure how I'll go about recording plays since I have both editions, but I'll probably record them all under this one from now on.

I have been ordering this game after seing review like the one from Zee Garcia, I was looking for a cool solo game to play quickly to relax. I have found everything I wanted. The game is very quick to learn and play but take a lot of time to master, exactly what you need from a solo game. The artwork is very childish but fun to me. The expansions are not all amazing but overall amusing and can be combine in deferents way to make your game more difficult and/or more fun.

Overall It is the perfect game for a quick fun on the plane, in the train or even at home when having some time to kill.

I picked up Onirim (second edition) while I was in the US at Christmas, more out of curiosity than hope. I've never enjoyed solo gaming when I've tried it in the past, preferring to just browse BGG instead when I don't have opponents. But I played Onirim 30+ times in January and loved it. It made me realise that I can scratch any itch I have for puzzly, non-interactive games without other players and save my valuable multiplayer time for games in which I can be a dick to people! The base game of Onirim seems incredibly well tuned to result in close finishes. I'm probably winning more than half now, but they often go right to the wire and are filled with agonising decisions. I've only just begun to explore the multitude of expansions so it looks like this delightful package will be keeping me occupied on trains and planes for some time to come.

My first foray into the Oniverse and I very much enjoy the presentation as well as all the variety. I enjoy the value of the game as well as the art style. The only issue stems from a lot of shuffling does occur with this title.

RATING: 8
Pretty much you've got a single deck, consisting of 76 cards, including 8 doors in two colors, and then a bunch of colored locations with one of three symbosl (sun, moon, and keys). You start the game with five cards in hand, and you either play a card into a row (with the card having to be a different symbol from an adjacent one), or discarding one, and drawing back up to five. If you build three cards of the same color in a row, you dig that colored door out of the deck. When you draw back up to five, if you draw a door, and have a matching key in hand, you can discard the key to gain the door. All you have to do is get all eight doors out to win. But... of course I'm leaving out the nightmare cards, which will ruin your day. When a Nightmare card shows up as you draw back up, you must choose to either A) Discard your hand and draw back up to five, ignoring nightmares (whenever you're drawing up to five, doors get thrown back into the deck if you can't key them), B) Discard a key from your hand, C) Throw an earned door back in the deck, or D) Draw the top five cards from the deck and discard any location cards. If you run out of cards in your deck, you lose.

Super simple, right? Yes. Right up until you lose.

The game is a contemplative experience when solo'd, but a bit more wild and unwieldy with a partner.

Light but not easy. Adorable art. Elegant design. However I don't see us playing this much as a two player and I would rather do something else, when I'm alone. While there is certainly some strategy and tactics involved, some games are basically unwinnable, while others will be easy with no way to mitigate luck of the draw, so your loss/win and score is not that dependant on how well you played.

 This game has been living in my shoulder bag for the last few weeks. A nice solitaire game for whenever I have 17-20 mins to kill, like the 2nd half of my lunch hour. But the big win is that my wife enjoys the 2 player co-op version! We've been playing it to wind down and connect before bed, but since it's always with me, I can also pull it out in a coffee shop, or at the airport, or on the plane. The best games are the ones that fit lots of potential play scenarios.

I own the app version of this game which does not as of this time have any expansion content. With that being said this is still a fun solo game that plays quickly but still has some real strategy.

Started with Sylvion and was very impressed with that game so thought I would give Onirim a shot. It is a neat and very quick game BUT very different obviously from the tower defense style of Sylvion. Lots of expansions but not sure I would want to play with all of them! Will pick and choose and test which ones I prefer. Some are definitely more bleh than others, but when there are 7 to choose from hard to complain!

Played the app version. I can see how that is the way to go with this game and all of the shuffling that keeps happening. I really enjoyed it. It's got a decent amount of depth/decisions for a game that plays so quickly. My current 36.8% win percentage shows that it's got a good difficulty level to keep things interesting. Too high of a win % and its not a challenge, too low and it can be too discouraging.

Onirim offers a fairly zen-like solitaire experience, though nothing here really evokes much excitement. Tension, certainly, but not excitement. I have not tried the expansions included with the game but perhaps there's a bit of fun to be had there. All-in-all, it remains a unique design and Shadi Torbey has certainly created a fascinating IP in his "Oniverse". I have played a ridiculously high number of times since the app implementation, too. It can be addicting to pass some downtime.

(+) Truly forces you into tough decisions that challenge your ability to push, nay, *manipulate* your luck. 
(+) Creates tension from those meaningful decisions.
(+) Vibrant art and intriguing, surreal "Oniverse".

(-) Not particularly "fun". Not bad at all, just not fun.
(-) The physical implementation requires an absurd amount of shuffling.
(-) A streak of horrid luck can put you out of the running.

Curious, original, fresh, one-of-a-kind solo (or two-coop) card game, with very original art, very simple mechanics, VERY addictive, and very entertaining. Also, it´s cheap. It´s one of the most peculiar games of my collection, and I like a lot its artistic aspect. It gives me hope that come out more games so art-brave like this one, with its own personality (I mean, without following the homogenous fashions that most of the artists follow today when illustrating a game). I´m playing this game a lot because, once you get the grip on its mechanics, it´s very addictive.

I enjoyed the original, but the additional modules (in box expansions) really take this up a notch.

Great artwork, highly re-playable, modular difficulty (various expansions make it harder or easier). It can be played solo or as a co-op pair. What a fantastic game. I am looking forward to more designs from this designer (I already own and like Urbion too).

RATING: 6
One of the more interesting solo games I've played.  Has lots of different variations to try out.  Artwork is really interesting and the box design is super cool.

Update:  After playing several times now, I'm already bored with this game.  It is extremely repetitive gameplay, even when using the expansions.  There isn't enough variety between turns to keep my mind happily entertained.  Fun to play occasionally when I haven't played in awhile but not okay for frequent plays.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Only played iOS version.  It is a very light solo game about set collection to play 8 door cards from the deck before you run out of cards, with 10 nightmare cards forcing you to discard your hand/discard top 5 cards of your deck/discard a key/or place a door back in the deck.  A little bit of strategy mainly around how to use keys: to look at the top 5 cards/reorder/discard 1 (best way to get rid of nightmares), as part of a 3-color set, or save to discard when you draw a door for a free door play or to stop a nightmare forcing a discard.  But a significant determiner in whether you win or lose is how the deck plays out, a deck that is constantly being reshuffled, so when you win it's a combination of good use of keys and lucky draws.  I understand there are lots of expansions that can increase the difficulty and strategy, but I just don't really have much interest in exploring this type of game - it's just one step up from Klondike and other traditional card solitaire games.  As you have to search through the deck for doors when you play 3 cards of the same color, and shuffle the deck constantly, I don't think I would ever bother with a physical version.

Played twice as a solo game. Just the base game. It is a very difficult game. I almost wonder if it is possible to win. The closet I have got was 6 doors. I find the game to be very random and lots of card shuffling. i mean LOTS. It is quite annoying sometime. I had the game new and the cards starting to look a little worn. 

UPDATE: played the digital version of it. It is so much better without the shuffling. I managed to win a few times so the game is definitely beatable. Still the game is okay. some choices are pretty obvious. My son watched me play on the ipad and we made the same choice on most of the decisions.I think this will get bored after a while. 

Still didn't try any expansion. Not sure if I care at this point.

:d6-1: I need to look at how integrated the incubus is, into it, or if a pawn can be used. Also, how abstract is it? It may say labyrinth, but I get the impression, it's not going to feel like it.

I've tentatively put this one, but I have questions that need answered about it first. I will post in the guild about it. Still, it's fast, easy set up, though alot of shuffling, which isn't my strong suit, but I deal with it.

You may already know enough based on my questions here, that it might be a no. It's a no until I get possibly the right answers. Unless those things, you know are fine.

4/2/16 I've looked into it, and we are good to go.

This is a fun little card filler with some expansions included in the box to add variety to the game.
Probably the only Oniverse game where I feel the artwork fits the theme, whether you know the background or not. 
I own both 1st & 2nd edition and the app. 1st edition is more compact,includes a subset of the expansions and easier to play at cafes, parks etc.
2nd edition has been upgraded in all ways better art, more expansions and quality components, so makes a great experience for home or hotel use.
The app never gets played, but I could see it being the answer to some situations.
Difficulty is varied depending on what expansions you include in the game, although repeated plays will reveal solutions and strategies which make the game easier.

I couldn't resist but to get this version. For solo plays I fell in love with this game, I can play it in the bus, I can play while waiting on the bus, I can carry it with me anywhere.

And this version looks just great. The rulebook invites play and reading it. And it has the effect of "ooh, this looks cool, how does it play?" even though it's a simple deck of cards.

But I wouldn't buy it just for the box. The expansions included here, that were not in the first version, add a bit of different playstyles, which is such a welcome addition to a game I mostly play solo. Love especially the Dead Ends one.

Been considering getting this for a while and it's been on and off my wishlist multiple times. I find myself shuffling cards in my downtime so this game appealed to me, but wasn't sure if I should get a game that only I would play. Finally took a shot at it since it was on sale. It's pretty challenging but doesn't feature complex decision trees the way some puzzles do, and I like it. Don't think I'll mind pulling this out when I just want to relax or when I'm watching something and things start to get slow.

RATING: 9
A great solitaire game set in the dreamworld Oni universe, that will have you agonizing over your picks, wondering how to proceed as efficiently as possible through the strange cards.  The progression and pace of the game gives the impression of someone lost, groping for a way (or a key) out of their dream prison.  There is a two player variant, but this game is best when alone, desperately searching for doors to escape the dreamworld before the deck runs out and you remain with your nightmares, forever.  It's very satisfying when you succeed.  The version I have has 7 expansions as well, though I've only played the regular version and Dreamcatcher so far.

Bought this neat little solitaire after Zee Garcia's (Dice Tower) glowing review. It didn't disappoint. Quite a difficult solitaire that will have you cursing some of your  choices, but will reward you with a deep feeling of satisfaction when you manage to escape the dream labyrinth. Unique art style that adds to the theme. I know this game comes in app form, but there's something to be said for dealing yourself out cards and playing it in its analogue form. The production quality of the box and all its components is stellar, and there are some neat modules included that add extra flavour and complexity. High replay value and one of my favourites.

Played 15 or 20 games on the app (which is free to play the base game as of this review), and really didn't like it at all. It just felt bland. The chaining of nightmares that can occur gets annoying, as it feels like the difficulty in those instances isn't so much due to choices made as it is deck randomness.

The game difficulty was fine otherwise, but the theme and mechanics were just a bit dull. I've read that experienced players can achieve a pretty solid win rate, but it wasn't a game I wanted to spend more time with.

Because of this game.  I almost refused to ever play with myself again.

A nightmare indeed.  I know I'm in the minority here, but really? Gave it many chances. The hype eludes me.

The fun will evaporate here,  faster than a mid-summer rain puddle - unless,  of course,  shuffling cards is your bag.

Deluxe edition includes unwanted expansions and a piece of wood.

Really only play it solo and I enjoy it immensely. However, the amount of shuffling drives me insane and is the reason for the lower score. I really have to be in the mood to play it (again, because of the shuffling), otherwise it tends to be test of my patience leading to eventual irritation.

Nice solitaire game, with evocative dream imagery. Some expansions are weak and the constant shuffling did make the iOS version more appealing.

I feel like there's very little strategy here, and that I'm just flipping cards to see what happens. The card I need could be at the bottom of the deck , and there's nothing I could do about it.

This is one of my favorite solo games. Quick, simple, but challenging--especially with the right expansions. (Comes with 7 expansions...The Incubus is honestly quite a cute little token.)

RATING: 9.5
The artwork is the first thing that grabbed me, but this is a near-perfect solitaire game that also works very well with the 2-player variant. My only real gripe is that there is a lot of shuffling the deck, which is unavoidable, but it's worth it because the gameplay forces you to make tough choices, and the Nightmare cards adds so much tension. The included expansions are all fun and add a good amount of variety. You may want to buy sleeves for the cards since the main deck is going to wear a lot quicker than the expansion cards.

The second edition vaults this ahead of the original. Incredible artwork & play both, and the new expansions layered in take it into something special.


The base game is pretty dry & narrow; like the others in the series it really isn't the game. I recommend just starting with The Glyphs, The Dreamcatchers, and the Door to the Omniverse as it'll eliminate the infamous (and profoundly irritating) constant shuffling, adds pleasurable breadth, and just gives you lots more fun in deck management. And, well, fun.

Current favored play is with The Glyphs, The Dreamcatchers, Towers, Crossroads & Dead Ends, and the Door to the Omniverse. I don't recommend Crossroads & Dead Ends until the others have been mastered and you want to elevate the challenge. I'm uncertain if Towers will stay, it does give you some look-ahead but feels vestigal rather than the momentous change adding Crossroads & Dead Ends.

Solo, it feels like a certain solitaire game I used to play as a kid when I was bored at my grandmother's house, except it takes more table space. Haven't played it co-op, nor with the extensions--haven't had the interest after a few runs of the base game.

Surprisingly good solo/duo game. The second edition's expansion modules are necessary to make the game difficult enough.

Edit: Dropped a point simply because we don't play much.

Cheap, quick, interesting, strategic are just a few words that come to mind when I hear the word "Onirim". I acquired the game and made 10 plays within the first 2 days without even discovering any of the included expansions. I like it a lot for what it is!

A great game to play with my SO. Finally won (legitimately)! We were playing wrong the whole time...kept forgetting about the symbol not matching whenever we got a door...I guess we had it in our minds that a new set was starting so we could ignore that rule...whoops.

Superb brain-teaser! This great game in a small box follows me on many of my journeys. It is excellent both with and without the expansions - but it definitely tickles the braincells more when you include one or two of the expansions.

They should rename this Solitaire: The Shuffling. Eghads, you are picking up the deck and reshuffling about every 45 seconds.

If you can live with that that, Onirim is a decent puzzle. There's a bunch of nonsense about dreams, labyrinths, hidden doors and nightmares, but there is no real narrative in the game. Those things are all just card suits, which you try to play in a particular order to achieve the game's victory conditions.

Your first few games it may feel pretty random, but once you wrap your head around it deeper strategies emerge. There is a lot of deck manipulation and with experience, you will even start to use the game's own discard traps against it, to help you win.

I don't know that it is interesting enough for me to want to teach it and play with someone else. It's fine to burn a few minutes of downtime and much better than the classic solitaire games most folks play with a standard deck of cards. The added deck manipulations and hand control make a victory seem much more like something you have earned than something you stumbled into with a lucky shuffle. Which makes each victory feel much more satisfying.

The game comes with 7 expansions that range from helpful, such as adding more ways to manipulate things, to hardcore, requiring the player to successfully achieve all eight goals in a specific order to win. It's a neat addition for those that truly want to suck the marrow out of this game, but for most people I imagine the base game will be plenty challenging enough.

RATING: 8
This game is fun solo or cooperative and there are so many expansions that change up the goals in such interesting ways that I feel this is the most versatile of the Oniverse games.

Onirim (the app) is the best beginning point to see if you like solo games like this.

Nautilion is the fastest playing but with the least difficult choices.

Castellion is the best cooperative experience

Sylvion is the most "gamey" of the series and is excellent but does take a little longer.

RATING: 8
Only played solo. The base game is very easy and I haven't lost a game to it yet but the main game really lies in adding in those expansions. Have played 2 of them so far with varying degrees of difficulty. Love the overall presentation as well.

fantastic solo game.  It feels very solitarish but with somewhat of a theme and I like it a little bit better.  It gives me the same feel that I get from pandemic when I draw a Nightmare card where it is always at the worst time possible.  I want to play some of the expansions because they seem to sound really good, but with just the base game alone it is still a lot of fun.

Love the app but the feeling of this solo card game (that can play 2 cooperatively) in your own hands is a good one. Searching for those doors while trying to figure out if so save a key or use it is a good puzzle. Plus the box comes with 7 expansions!

An amusing solitaire game that has rules for two players but it works best solo. It's a good pastime- quite a stimulating puzzle as you manipulate the deck to increase your odds of finding those doors at the right time.

This is a lot of game in small package. A fun twist on classic solitaire card games, with a strange theme, even stranger art, and engaging gameplay.

Actually the packaging of the game itself is highly interesting, and enhances the dreamlike feel of the entire experience.

I love how it includes seven expansions in the base game, and how those can be added separately, or together for whatever combination is most interesting for you. Sadly this title doesn't include the figure in such an interesting way as in future Oniverse games.

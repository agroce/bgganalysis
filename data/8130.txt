Quite pleasant little market manipulation game.  There are a few things to track--not too many--and the turns can go quick.  And you can't beat the box size!

Nice little game. Probably best with 3 players but not bad with two either. Playing with 4 players would probably make the game too random. I like how the face-up goods determine price but given that there are only 5 goods you frequently are stuck hurting yourself to influence another player.

REALLY nifty economic simulation-ish thing.  Trying to predict where each good will go, pushing your favorite up...but not too far...makes for surprisingly good gaming in such a small box.  No language-specific components, so don't be afraid to import this one.

This could be a great game with a couple changes. It's hard enough to strategize your plays, but you constantly need to recount how many of each color have been played. Good basic mechanic, a little tedious to execute.

{1 play • 3 player} The graphics are kind of crappy and future play may cool my opinion, but I'm really taken with this cool new spin on Modern Art.  Actually, that's an unfair comparison, probably being made simply because both games trigger "scoring" when 5 cards of a type hit the table.  Other than that, Die Fugger stands on its own as a solid little game that - at least for now - I like better than Modern Art.

unable to rate fairly due to rules issues the first time out, but i'm sure i'll end up playing it again the right way.  first indication is that it's similar to but surprisingly not as good as knizia's trendy, but we'll see.

RATING: 7
The game play deserves an 7 or 8. But there are problems with the design of the cards that should reduce it to 6 or 7 - if only so that Adlung would think more about what they are producing. If there are going to be small color-coded symbols on the goods cards, then put the same symbols on the folded value marker cards. I use small wooden markers and lay the scoring track as a line rather than a circle and everything is much clearer.

This is not an auction or bidding game, but rather sequential play of goods. The similarity to Modern Art is in the way a round ends when the fifth card of one type is played. The sale value of the goods is based on relative movement from the previous value (not absolute as in Modern Art) and crashes when it goes too high.

Two plays (4-p, 3-p).

Nice first impression, though we played it wrong by having values continue on past the "1" instead of stopping immediately...made a wee difference! Still, everyone seemed to enjoy it, and it looks to have the makings of a good lunch game.

Second play was much better - played with the proper rules and played with 3-p...as others have mentioned, this does seem to be a good number to play with.

A mildly interesting game, but I never felt that I could properly speculate what the value of something would be.  Perhaps just a little too chaotic for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Decent set collection game.  Luck of the draw can be significant.  The valuation mechanic feels like Modern Art (5th card of a color ends the round, and that color is "best"), but the similarity ends there.  Seems hard to grasp the value of the goods at the beginning of your first game.  In general, the value of goods is cyclical; it increases to as much as 9, then stalls at 1, then increases toward 9 again.  Note to self: play merchant cards early in the game when you hit a turn where you cannot play much that is useful for yourself.  Typical scores per player per round have a wide range from 0-36 points.

I payed a little more for this game then I'd like to admit, but this was an enjoyable little gem. On the surface it appears to be fairly random economic manipulation game, but you've got more control over the market then you originally believe. I'm really looking forward to getting this to the game again. It's a shame so few copies were made.

RATING: 8
This reminds me alot of Modern Art.  (There're no auctions, however, which makes it work alot better for 2 players.)  Most of our games have been decided by the final scoring of the face-down cards; effectively making the rest of the game irrelevent.  My other complaint is that 2 of the 5 suits are orange.  Despite these problems, this is a fast, enjoyable game with interesting choices to make.

RATING: 7
Nice game of market manipulation and commodity speculation.  There are some interesting dynamics of trying to crash the value of goods in which you opponent is investing heavily, while trying to maximize your value.

The game would be extremely boring without the market wheel, that allows you to cross critical thresholds of pricing.  The game works pretty well two player, with just a little bit of hidden information.

Perhaps a step below Wildlife Safari and Divinare in terms of overall experience, but bang-for-your buck on size is hard to beat.

Here we have a unusual beast. A card game that seems to have a great deal of depth. A Card game not involving trick taking or set collection. An excellent game indeed. Ok it's still a card game so its not terribly deep but there is plenty of room for good tactics. I think this will have staying power.

Initially a strange game. Then it becomes a somewhat interesting design of commodity speculation. And then you will tear your hair out over the atrocious graphical design which obscures the most important piece of information: how many cards of a particular type of resource have already been played. Had this title been produced as a small boardgame it would have scored significantly higher with me. Right now, it's fairly unplayable. Damned shame.

Components: Functional cards, though the coloring for the copper and spices can be difficult to discern at a glance, and AS IF we're going to bend the commodity markers.

Experience: A lot of fun. The rounds go quickly, since Jacob the Rich gets a card every time someone else plays a card. There are interesting decisions about which commodities to go in for: those which are currently pricey, but might clock over, or those that are up-and-coming.

Sort of Loco/Thor meets Modern Art, the game almost feels like it had been designed by Mr. Knizia. It is a short card game with a substance.  Trying to manipulate the goods' prices takes some thought and careful timing. Although in saying that, I must confess that the game somehow did not fully convince me, perhaps because of the nature of gameplay that feels a bit chaotic at times.  Due to the similarity with the much prettier and simpler (while not in any way less fun) game Thor, I don't really find it necessary to keep Die Fugger in my collection any longer.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Players are medieval merchants speculating on stocks.  On your turn you can play a commodity card from your hand, or draw a card.  There are five different commodities, and when the fifth card of a type is played, the round is over (think Modern Art).  Prices for commodities are then adjusted on a price "clock", where the market can crash if a commodity floods it (the price winds around from 9 to 1), however the market can't "anti-crash" (ie. you cannot go from 1 to 9!).  Commodities played are then paid out based on the new price.  Light, fun game that is very reminiscent of the Trendy groupthink.

Feels a little like Flinke Pinke crossed with Trendy.  Seemed a bit luck-dominated, but needs further playings.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A very clever game. The gameboard is created by laying out cards. Players compete to control commodity prices by putting out commodity cards. Play too many cards and the value may collapse. Don't play the right cards and you'll miss out on making money. You also get the opportunity to place a "bet" in the opening rounds - let me take a big jump in the standings.

Played 3 times. So far only 2-player, and I must say that the 2-player game is a little lacking. Not because the basic mechanics are lacking, but because the 3rd "player", Jakob, introduces a lot of luck into the 2-player game. I lost a game based on one flip of the card to Jakob. Still, a sound game played with 3, I'd bet. reminds me of Meuterer, but more of a card game, and less of a "board" game.

RATING: 7
Basically a game of chicken where someone eventually flinches and puts down that 5th trade good to end the round.  Then it is a little adjusting and accounting until someone hits 100 florins.  Nice twist in the hidden trade good for a variable blind scoring at game's end.  Will play again.  I think the portability (as with all Adlung Spiele games) makes this a perfect travel companion.  Heck, I could even coax my better half to give this one a try should be stuck in an airport again.

Nifty little economic game that reminds me of Flinke Pinke with some ideas from Die Händler and Modern Art.  Your choices are tightly constrained, but there's opportunity for interesting tactical maneuvering, and timing your plays requires some finesse.  I like the interaction between the two goals: influencing the commodity prices and scoring points.  Sometimes you can do both at the same time, sometimes you must do one at the expense of the other.  I've played this multiple times with each size of 2, 3, and 4 players - I think it's very good with 3, poor with 4 (goes too quickly, spins out of control), and interesting but very random with 2 due to all the cards played by the Rich Fugger.

Kind of interesting but also a little fussy--you have to spend a disproportionate amount of game time counting things up and adjusting this and that. Also, the the components really hurt this one; it really needs a simple board and pawns instead of the messy card layout, and more importantly the cards all kind of look the same, which is a real problem when you ought to be able to apprehend the overall game situation with just a glance at the table.

Commodity/market speculation game. Each round players play cards which will increase the value of that type of good and give them a unit of it for scoring. However, if too many appear in the market, the price will "crash" and be worth very little!
We play the game that the price can move from say 8 to 4 one round (if it were increased by 5 units), not that it crashes and is stuck at 1 for that round.

There's an enormous amount of accounting for relatively few interesting decisions; it took us as long to calculate scoring as to play hands.  Also: the two-player variant relies too much on the random actions of a dummy player, and the cards are insufficiently distinguishable across the table.

Die Fugger plays quickly and is easy to play (though the rules are very confusing and difficult to digest), but I find it to be very chaotic and difficult to control.  I guess you just have to accept that the values will most probably change throughout the course of the round, it's just hard to predict by how much.  Still, for a game of this length, I can accept the randomness and attribute some of it to unfamiliarity with the game.

Update: traded away.

More fun than it looks. A very simple supply-and-demand game with a mix of strategic and tactical decision-making. For once, a 2-player ruleset that works well. The cards are pretty ugly, but the game works well, and, once you read the descriptions on this site rather than the rules translation that comes with the game, is easy to teach. But Loco/Flinke Pinke does some of the same things in a shorter and more fun game.

There are some "odd things" that happend with the pretend markets in the game, and there is a bit too much of the "luck of the draw" for my taste, taking the nature of the game into account (in other words, luck of the draw is better suited to more "social" games, but not semi-serious games such as Die Fugger).  Would definitely be willing to take it for another spin after two games.

This is an interesting game in which you have to make some decisions that are similar to those made in Loco! The timing of when to play the 4th card of a particular good is critical, as the 5th card triggers the end of the round. There is a fair amount of luck involved, as you never know what card Jacob the Rich will play.  It is highly portable and bargain priced (as are all Adlung Spiele games).

2-4p, 45m. Klaus-Jürgen Wrede 2003.
Economic commodities speculation theme in a tiny box.

Play face-up cards to influence the price of commodities and score short-term gains.  Play face-down cards for long-term (double) profits.  Contains a classic limiting mechanism which penalizes the popular/expensive goods by "wrapping around" their price once it hits max, so you generally want to make your commodity come in 2nd or 3rd, or even last, rather than just powering into the majority position.

Rating after first play, with 4 players.  Would like to try with other numbers.
Received in trade for [gameid=5791] in June 2006.

The game where calling your opponents a bunch of fuggers is actually a compliment. One of the better offerings from Adlung Spiele, the cram alotta game into a single pack of cards company.

There is a rondel of cards that forms the basis for market variation.

You play down market cards until you have 5 different types. Then you score and advance the top 3 by the number of the cards. Since there is a 1-9, once you go around to 9, the next valued card is 1. This makes the high value commodity different and shifts focus from one to another.

Falls into the medium heavy economics filler game.

A very interesting exercise in economy, playing very differently with 2,3 or 4 players.

Perhaps a teensy bit prone to randomness and runaway leader, but this is minimised within a few games and with fewer players.

This game is, together with [i][url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/902]Meuterer[/url][/i], the gem of the [i]Adlung[/i] card games.  Wrede shows here that he is not an author of only one game.  Nevertheless the rules are easy, there are multiple choices and a lot of strategy, bluffing and double guessing.  If you want to point something negative, it needs a lot of calculation, so if you play many times you'll get the feel of doing a Math homework.

Die Fugger -- Played once; four-player.  I'd like to try this with three players, because Jakob der Reiche is likely to become more dynamic, but also to see if less time between turns leads to more player control.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Played a DIY copy once with 3P. Die Fugger is a game of commodity speculation which resembles a more complex [thing=398][/thing]. During a round, players manipulate the values of 5 different goods by playing down goods cards. A round ends when 5 cards of the same good have been played down, and then all goods are scored. 

The 3 goods with the most cards played have their value move clockwise on the value wheel equal to the number of corresponding cards played. While this typically increases the value of a good, the value can plummet if it crosses the value 9 threshold. The remaining 2 goods have their value decrease by 1. An additional wrinkle is the ability to play cards face down in the first two rounds, and these cards will only score at the end of the game.

Despite the interesting scoring system, it is difficult for players to plan ahead as each player begins with only 2 cards in hand (unless they have played a Merchant in the previous round). The susceptibility to random draws is a frustrating aspect in this otherwise decent card game.

Fun little micro-economy.  Players buy into products in the market to push the value up, but must risk manage against opposing players investing heavily in the same commodities.  Jacob the Rich throws the market off nicely as a NPC.  Tough decisions as to what you want to secretly invest in.  I would have liked to have had more options to what cards I played.  If I play it again I will try to keep a bigger hand.  With a small hand you fall prey to whatever is dealt to you.  If you aren't aware of this possibility, then the game can be frustrating.  

UPDATE: The game is better with less players, but even still it is very luck dependent.  Having the right cards is much more important than "clever" game-play. Perhaps all players should start with one merchant in hand. Also it needs markers to tally up what the totals of all the cards are so that you can see what is going on at a glance.

RATING: 7
Simple card game. Cards 1-9 are placed clockwise; these are the Market, and indicate the prices of 5 commodities. A marker (card) for each commodity is placed in the 5 position. The Jakob the Rich card is set close by. Players each get 4(?) cards. 

1 play, 2er:
Players rotate taking turns. On your turn, you draw a card if you have <4 cards. Then, play a card face up. The first 2 turns, you may play 1 card each round face down _in addition_ to the face up card. At the end of each round, draw a card from the draw deck and add to Jakob's area. Any time a commodity card is played face up (on your turn, or for Jakob), count all the cards of that type face up on the board. The turn ends if there are 5 of that type: score, and start again unless someone got to 100  points. If so, reveal and score all hidden commodities and score them (below). If starting the next round, first deal 2 more cards to everyone; players who played 1 merchant get 2 more cards (total 4); those who played 2 merchants get 3 more (total 7). Play continues with the player who would have played next.

End of Turn Scoring: First, count how many cards there are for each of the 5 commodities. The top 3 will move clockwise in the Market, one step for each card played. If any commodity would move past 1, it stops at 1. All other commodities move counterclockwise (down) ONE space (but not past the '1' value). Each player adds up the value of the cards they've played. If any commodity has <3 total cards played, those commodities marked with a rose count as double value.

End of Game Scoring: all hidden cards are revealed and score double their current Market value (ignore roses)
--

This is a fun game of bluff and timing. You have to deal with luck of the card draw, but there's certainly room to play tactically. Seems important to set yourself up (when possible - Jakob's randomness makes it more difficult) to control when the Turn ends.

[Adlung 'Die Fugger' 2003 Edition] {Merchant; commodity speculation, secret-goal, hand management; optimal 4p} Fugger is lightweight game with tricky manipulation of the price of commodity. It provides meaningful decisions. It has nice player interactions and players can develop intrigues. It's really a bargain for this rich game with such a low price.

Luck is not that important in Fugger because a player can always make good use of their hand. This game may fall flat if some of the players don't understand the rules and can't manage their cards; in this case, the game will become quite random. 

Merchant cards are quite powerful; having more cards allow player to lay down more commodities than other players; he needs not use turns to draw cards. Players shall pay attention to the running score so that they can set up the price of their hidden commodity effectively; esp. when it is predicted to be the second last round.

I would not fold the game cards. It's just fine to have the cards lying on the table. Since it's quite troublesome to keep track of the game. I used the following accessories: 5 d6 dice to mark the number of cards that have been played for each commodity during the round and poker chips to mark the price.

Jogo bem interessante, de flutuação econômica. Os jogadores vão distribuindo seus recursos de modo a influir na cotação e para tentar obter o melhor preço para suas mercadorias ao mesmo tempo que tentam derrubar a cotação das melhores mercadorias do adversário.

Feels a like a (more complicated) relative of Botswana or Explosiv, where you want to play as many cards as you can in a certain suit but don't want other players to put it over the maximum by playing their own cards. The suits that have the most cards played will increase in value, except there's a maximum value and suits will wrap around to the bottom if they go above it. Pretty fun, slightly aimless at times, probably too much luck as you have to draw new cards blindly from a deck.

I don't much like a couple of the details in the rules, but they can be removed. One is merchant cards, which have no value but let you get two cards later. Seems pointless. The other is the ability to play cards "face down" at the beginning of the game, so that they will count at the end of the game. I guess the idea is that the player could aim to keep a certain suit valuable, but I don't know how controllable that is.

The beginning of the game seems weird. Nobody wants to play a suit that will end up having five cards played, because that suit will wrap around and be worthless. So if you even play a couple of cards in the same suit, other players may select that suit to gang up on, since the wrap-around will hurt you more than them. Otherwise everyone just seems to gradually build every suit up equally.

I also think it might help if you had more drafting choices when getting new cards.

Interesting little card laying game with a market system. Only the three goods that were most played by the players score, but the price of each is on a circular scale. And the amount of movement is based on how many cards are played. So, you can end up having a good wrap around from 9 back to 1, and thus all the profit potential is reduced. Thus, you may only want 3 Spices to be on the table so it advances from the $6 to the $9 spot, but your opponent throws an extra one reducing it back to $1. Out of print and will never be reprinted because of legal issues with the name, I'm glad I hunted a copy down.

Played a few times. A quite good game by itself, which is even better if you consider its price and volume. One of the best Adlung games for gamers - even if it is no Meuterer.

I like this game, I don't have my head around the strategies yet, but it is good to play

Based on one playing; interesting, some tense moments.  Seems like there's some lack of control issues that would keep me from wanting to play it more; we'll see.

Rating may change, this is based on one playing.  I enjoyed the mechanic but am wondering if you can effectively formulate a strategy in this game.

There is not quite enough control in this game...

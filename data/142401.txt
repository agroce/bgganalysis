We have a lot of fun with this game. My only complaint is that the little piles of cards get messy really easily, and we're just two adults!

Cool concept. Minecraft lite in a boardgame setting. Roll the dice to determine what materials you've mined. Use the materials to build stuff. Build stuff to please the dwarfs and earn their special abilities.

While the "stick-on" dice were a major disappointment, the game itself is simple and fun. There is almost no reason to pay attention when it is not your turn however, and the stealing mechanic might be a little unbalanced. Something not happening often doesn't make it fun or fair when it does.

An incredibly average Kickstarter game.  It is well represented by decent artwork/components...but the design itself is hodgepodge of concepts cribbed from several more popular games.  Move along...nothing of value to see here.

Great little game that's easy to learn and quick to play. Definitely filler, but good filler at that. Occasionally gets dusty.

I love these types of dice games far more than my husband, who seems to have terrible luck with them. The advantage this game has over similar dice games is that you can immediately save your resources for the next turn, though you also risk having them get stolen by other players. The addition of the vault is the perfect compromise: it delays your progress toward earning points, but provides an investment that will likely pay off in the end.

The one thing I didn't like was the card selection process, which often gave some players clear advantages based on the luck of the draw. Again, (I seem to be saying this a lot these days) a drafting process might solve this problem.

In the end, it's a fun, light dice game, with enough choices to keep you interested, but nothing too profound or earth-shattering. I'm worried that King's Forge will prove to be too similar once my KS package arrives, so I'll see which one we end up keeping.

Kickstarted (2013)

Very light, press-your-luck game.  Not bad, but there is not a ton of decisions to be made on a turn-by-turn basis.  I was sucked in, of course, by the fact that it has many dwarves in it.  My wife enjoyed the game, so this will get played.

Lasts almost too long, but it seemed to run fine our game.  It was very close the entire game (tied twice).  I am not sure on the win immediately factor, and I really not fan of the lazy tie-breaker (you win if its your turn).

Played, not logged.  This was an early kickstarter that i picked up.  The game play is not bad, but nothing really special to the game.  Roll the dice and see if you can make an item.

Munchkin adores.  Teaches to his friends.  press your luck dice to gain resources. manage those resources to craft items to satisfy your most generous patrons... One of the more complex games that a 6yo tackled and mastered.

RATING: 6
High degree of variance between the dice rolling (which determines how much you can accomplish per turn) and the patron cards (which determine how compex an order you can fill, and how many VP each order is).

While there is some planning and prioritization decisions to be made, you are limited by the random factors above. I rate the game good but not great. I feel like a push your luck dice-roller should be more explosively random, and a game more fitting this theme would have some way to manipulate dice besides re-rolling them.

You can bank results between turns - so there is that.

Nice job - fun theme and art.  Played with the insurance variant, which seemed fine, as we are not really a stealing lot.  Did not last too long - not sure how samey subsequent plays will feel.  Rating could go up.

This one is easy to learn and although it offers a challenge, it is a fast play, with most games lasting about 30 minutes. I've yet to win, as my 8-year-old is a master at this one.

Doubt I'll touch this one again.

The idea is simple: A bunch of dwarves need items to be happy.  In order to grab items, you need materials.  You get materials by rolling dice, which allows you mine them or steal from other plays.  The more difficult the dwarf, the more points you get.  Each dwarf order, when completed, gives you a special ability.

I've literally described the entire game.  Now imagine this simple mechanic for over an hour.  It's a tedious affair.

The mechanics seem sound at first, but the issue arrises when you realize the decision making is simply risk management and not weighing your options.  Unlike dice games with re-rolls like King of Tokyo, there are no seperate mechanics to consider when rolling your dice.  There are only three mechanics in the game: Orc (disables your die), Robber (Steals from other players), or gather materials.  You also re-roll your dice any number of times.

That's the game in a nutshell.  For an hour.

If this game was a short 20 minute filler, it wouldn't be so bad, but it pretends it can offer more than that and falls flat on its face.  I won't bother with this one again.

Easy to learn and easy to play. It is pretty fun to play and the mechanics are easy.
Overall, good game play with lots of replayability. It is easy for most any age. Would recommend for a family game.

This game has been well-received by my play group. It doesn't have a lot of player interaction and can feel a little bit like multi-player solitaire depending on whether players communicate about what they are doing on their turn, but it is still an enjoyable lightweight game with fun press-your-luck dice-rolling and some decent decision-making.

A fairly good light-weight game with lots of dice rolling. There isn't a lot of strategy here, but the games are pretty short. The only downside is that the game has a larger footprint on the table than a game of this weight should have. When compared to Dead Man's Draw or Dungeon Roll, this game takes up a ton of room (though compared to most medium-weight games it is typical in size).

A light game, easy for an eight-year-old to learn, as long as there are older players at the table to help explain things.

The infinite dice re-roll mechanic slows the game down significantly.  There are too many different kinds of resources, and no single resource is more valuable than any other (except for the wildcard "artifacts"), so it doesn't really matter what you roll.

Stealing from other players is generally pointless because a single resource isn't worth much, but that's the only way players interact.  There is no real resource contention in the game.

Because the dice determine almost 100% your actions, this is really a dice game.

Similar to Splendor in some ways. Besides being fantasy based, it had a bit more direct take-that attacks between players. Not a bad thing but not for my family that would rather play Splendor.

This is a very light game.  Seems to be preferred by younger kids than the adults. 

Your are rolling dice to collect resources. Trading resources in for items to fulfill requests/goals there by giving you points and sometimes a special power/ability.

The artwork is very nice.

The game itself is pretty straightforward: get resources to build items to fill orders to get points. Sometimes this kind of game is called for. This game however might be too simple and straightforward for its own good, creating an atmosphere of tedium. The way to get said resources is boring in its own right (rerolling six dice as many times as you want to get what you need, one side on the die renders it useless) and by definition luck-based. The only interesting thing about it is the patron cards that score you points. They each have a special abilities. The bad thing about this is you only fulfill a few patron cards per game (3-4) so only so many special abilities get triggered. At least it plays quickly.

RATING: 5.5
This is a decent light resource converting die roller with a bit of take that.  I quite liked rolling and pressing my luck to get just the resources I needed for a perfect turn.  Being able to improve your supply board and steal from the other players now and again was fun too.  I would rate this a little higher if I liked the adventurer powers a little better.  It seemed like most of them helped opponents perhaps more than their points were worth... so while I can appreciate the catch up mechanic it felt a little over done in my first game.  Perhaps with more plays it wouldn't feel as unbalanced... or with experience could be planned around better and my rating would rise.  I'd certainly give this another try to find out!

RATING: 10
Won at the Origins auction for $32--box is in mediocre condition, but insides are excellent, and only missing 1 red chit and a toad card.  Can't wait to play this one!  

Found the missing toad card mixed up with the items, so it was only missing one red chit!

Game is as good as they all promised, even without any expansions.  It's great they are re-printing it in an edition that sticks to 2nd Edition, since the game is a blast and hard to get a hold of.  Definitely a great example of an adventure game, no matter how random it is.  You can see the straight line of evolution to Prophecy.  Talisman is also almost endlessly expandable--it'd be very easy to add your own cards to the deck (and many people already have) without purchasing the prohibitively expensive official expansions.
 
That being said, I find myself drawn agonizingly close towards dropping $100+ for all of the 2nd edition expansions.[update]  Too late, I did.    

I expected a lot from Talisman and it did not disappoint!  

[update] Man, you guys weren't kidding about the broken Prophetess!  She's definitely getting removed from now on.  Luckily she got killed by some pit fiends right before she made it to the Crown of Command space, but her draw two and choose one ability really seems to go against the spirit of the game!  And the giant beetle in the dungeon?  You made my spy's life interesting...

RATING: 6
Rating based on one play that was probably faster and more straightforward than normal. Game mechanics and artwork are much more primitive than in Runebound, but Talisman wins hands-down on personality (despite, or maybe because of, the horrible artwork). I didn't mind the randomness of the Adventure cards (and actually found it funny) because the negative events were never completely devastating. I like how events and NPCs accumulate on the board; it makes the gameworld feel populated in a way that's completely missing in Runebound.

RATING: 8
Chaotic, random, crazy, utterly broken, fantasy-themed fun! This game is a never ending fountain of experiences and emotions ranging from the frustration of dying while approaching the crown of command or turning into a toad to the satisfaction of stealing the next players warhorse or slaying everyone else and winning the game!  :)

The spell cycling characters are broken, though.

This was played a lot, when I was a teenager, along with the Dungeon and Timescape expansions. It was never as fun as it promised to be, and I suspect we seldom finished a game. But I have fond memories of it, and am sad that I sold it several years ago.

RATING: 5.5
My strikes against it: it takes too long. And my second strike: it takes too long. I know - no strategy to it, runaway leader, blah blah. All true. But I still like it for the memories and wacky artwork (the second edition mind you, not the darker reworked later editions). If it played in 60 min or so, I'd really love it. Although if that were true, it just wouldn't be Talisman anymore. At this point in my life, I'd much rather play just about anything else.

Good theme but the unpredictable playing time is not a good thing. The Finnish edition I have has some of the best translations I've ever seen.

Talisman is a classic adventure game many of us have fond memories of. If you look back at it now, you can see that Talisman comes with a great story but you have to admit that the game is poor. It is an endless roll-and-draw-a-card quest that never ends (emphasis on the tautology). Sure there are events to live through, enemies to fight and loot to pick up. However, the game just has a tendency to send you back to square one over and over again. Thus you usually end up spending hours without ever completing the quest, except for the rare cases when you actually win in just an hour.

I find Talisman a game where you are not actually playing but just living the story. Do yourself a favour and do not bother analyse anything. Just sit down, listen to what the game has to tell you and see if this is your day as the hero who beat all the odds.

RATING: 7
This holds a special place in my gaming history. Also on the evil side... As a friend of mine says "It is always a good idea to play Talisman - until you start to play Talisman"...

The new edition made me wait for something specia., but right now I'm quite disappointed: 4th ed Talisman is far worse than Runebound!

Almost every Talisman game that I have played lasted FAR longer than it should due to the horrible endgame mechanism and certain characters that are grossly over powered (i.e. Prophetess).

I bought this in Barnardo's at the age of 15 for 50p. 

It's...Talisman. It has its flaws and it's showing its age. Sometimes though you just want to put your brain away and go on a random adventure, roll some dice and see what happens.

Fun fact: I also picked up a copy of the Games Workshop edition of Cosmic Encounter at the same shop, also for 50p. I played a single two player game, decided it was stupid (what is this? You just use the card with the highest number!) and threw it in the bin. Roughly 17 years later now and I haven't forgiven myself.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.9
Played it a lot in the past. I always enjoyed the art and the wandering. Dubbed RSI (for obvious reasons) by my group there wasn't ever terribly much skill in it, even with various house rules. I've probably resigned myself to not playing it again, as there are simply better uses for my time. However it will always have that certain special place in my heart. Who can forget being Cursed by a Hag, visiting the mystic, becoming evil to pick up the Rune sword and who can forget being ransacked by the Raiders. Happy days.

Delightful the first few plays, but then it starts to feel like you just ate an entire box of Red Hots that you washed down with a Big Gulp. In other words, tasty tasty but not something you want to do all that often. Talisman has quirkiness and spirit, though, and because of that I vastly prefer it to many of the other fantasy games out there. I'm curious to see Mythgardia by the same author!

The mother of all fantasy role playing board games. Was nice when it came out for there was no real other game like that back then. 
Has serious balancing issues in charackter design and adventure cards. Too much luck for my taste. Nevertheless it was fun playing for some years, so still a solid "6". If you like games like that you should try Pathfinder: The Card Game, Mage Knight or Prophecy instead.

I love fantasy settings, and I have had fun with Talisman. Some games can be quite competitive, and when they are its a fun enough game. The problem is that the opposite scenario is at least just as likely - the reliance on die rolls and top-decking spells or adventure cards means one player can catapult into the lead and win easily, or worse, one player can make steady progress while some other players are stuck in the outer region, hoping to land on something good.

There are numerous other technical problems, too. Some hero cards are much better than others, gold becomes obsolete quite a long time before you stop getting it, the difference between good and evil characters becomes inexplicably less significant in the inner and middle regions, etc

But ultimately, the problem I have with this game is the same one I have with Monopoly - it has a tendency to go far too long for the experience it provides. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Random, and over-rated, but playable with just the base games. However, as each expansion is added (perhaps say one) then more and more time is added without a big payoff. (There may be good and bad expansions, but I just don't remember).

Talisman is THE definitive vintage fantasy board game. And I mean "board game" in the sense that your average man on the street means it -- roll and move, something happens, try to win before your opponent (or in this case, destroy him!). Have games evolved since then? Yes. Were there far more evolved games even at the time of its release? Yes. But that says nothing about the quality of Talisman for a game of this weight. It offers a fully-rendered fantasy feel, and adds layer upon layer of story development as it progresses through what feels like a year in the life of these adventurers. The characters are changed by their experiences, and the world becomes richer as spaces take on new contexts via card draws. What the 2nd edition lacks in spit & polish (relative to the 4th edition), it makes up for with sheer vintage presence. It's a noble trophy in gaming, and in my collection.

I still have a great deal of nostalgia for this game, but it just doesn't hold up well compared to other options.

Good times, but it is out dated, and while I have no desire to play it again anytime soon, I do look forward to playing it with Wylie when he comes of age.  I think it is a perfect into game.

Well, there was a time when I would have rated Talisman much higher, but like many GW games, they expanded it to death.  After about the 3rd. expasion the lack of playtesting became apparent, as it does in most GW game.  The game became more and more drawn out until it became a complete pointless utter bore to play.  I finally gave up when the last expansion "Dragons" was released.  I sold the whole lot about a year and a half ago for a bucket of money which I then used to buy many enjoyable games with.  If you are playing with more than about 3 people and have more than a couple of expansions inserted, be prepared for a long drawn out bore.  This game once had charm, but it was ruined.  Its a dice and draw neverending luck fest.  There was a time when I would have given it an 6, but like most GW item, it soured on the vine.

The never-ending game.  I used to own it and all the expansions, except Dragons, and while it was enjoyable it got to the point where the game would drag on until someone decided to try for the win.

RATING: 10
Beautiful, simple, with its own style. I remember it as fun and inspiring for the family, and it's equally good today for long days with friends. I've heavily customised the decks with homebrew and fan content, for a long, harder, more varied play. Yes it's rather random and not very strategic, but it for some light, fun, fairy-tale adventure this edition is a classic.

Candyland for fantasy gamers.  Appeals only late at night, but unfortunately since this is "the game that never ends", this extends the night even further!   Roll the dice, move your pawn, do what the spot says, wait for your turn to come around again.  Sigh.

Big game, looks good but takes forever to play.  The more players the longer it takes.  Played with 8 people one time and it took 4 hours and everyone got tired and quit it before the final end.  People and the game works hard to keep you from winning which can be very frustrating for many. has any variations however obviously some really like it.

(Applies to all three editions of the game.) Acquired primarily for nostalgia purposes. Honestly, though, Talsiman is an extremely random game. Your movements are determined by die rolls. You draw cards that ask you to roll dice. Decision-making is at a minimum. Still, there is a whimsical charm about the game and its expansions. There just needs to be a real game that captures that whimsy!

It's that game you play when you want to play a game but not really pay attention to it.  Like you want to be doing something while watching a terrible movie or having a conversation.  Or perhaps your drunk and can't focus on anything overly brain burning.

One of the VERY best Games Workshop fantasy games.  Actually probably one of the very best fantasy games by anyone.  The artwork is very good and the variety of characters and encounters is wonderful.  The only drawback is that it is in high demand, so if you see an inexpensive copy BUY IT.

D&D boardgame dominated by die rolls (roll and move, encounters determined by 1d6 table, combat, etc.). Feels a lot like a version of "Monopoly" where you can choose which direction in which to move. My copy came from the novelty of discovering Games Workshop at a time when "foreign" games were scarce in North America. This one turned out to have been a mistake so it's gone. I don't miss it.

RATING: 2
Had 1st Edition and then 2nd Edition and most of the expansions - but now I wonder WHY? Way too long, each turn you usually make just 1 decision, do I move left or right ... then it's just a matter of roll the dice, read a bit, roll some more. (Tried 3rd edition - just as bad, fell asleep playing it after getting so bored I tried to count the number of skulls drawn on the board ... gave up when I reached 70) now traded my 1st & 2nd edition stuff doubt I'll ever play this again.

Possibly the best fantasy game in terms of integrating a topic, but totally unbalanced, way too luck-driven, and with few interesting decisions. However, it has much nostalgic value to me as I played it a lot when I was young, so I don't mind playing it once in a while just for the hell of it.

One of the most mindless die rolling fests out there. No idea what the appeal of rolling a dice for hours on end is. You may as well just roll once, highest roll wins and takes less time, is less boring and has exactly the startegic input as playing Talisman.

One of my all-time favorite games.  I will absolutely never get tired of playing this game (in the long run, at least, I could see myself getting burned out in the short term if I played many, many games of it in a short time period.)  A perennial favorite amongst every gaming group I have ever been part of.

RATING: 3
Sorry.  I try to take into consideration when a game was designed and the context (mechanics, style) of the time.  But I can't do it for this game.  It's just boring.  The decisions are mostly minor and it's just too much luck based to justify 2-3 hours of play.  Tales of Arabian Nights is a much better game.

RATING: 5
This is in a group of strange games that I dislike, 
but ended up playing a lot of. It is mindless, yet random
enough that there is more interest than other mindless
pursuits. It also was something that could be dragged
out for the low-grade RPGers we sometimes would hang with.
They were really unable to handle anything requiring thought
(but one was cute - which was sufficient).

A game that I love since my childhood. Everytime I play it, memories of so many hours of joy come back.

The art is old fashioned but beautiful. I´d come back to this any time! A real classic in boardgame history.

We really like this game. Great adventure, and like in a real adventure you never know what you are going to get along the way. Quite a bit of element of luck or not with the adventure cards you turn up or the roll of the dice in combat. Real fun trying to stop each other from getting to the Crown of Command. 

If you like fantasy games, with dice combat role... This is a game for you.

RATING: 7
Even though I rated this low, it's just dungeoncrawl, it should be said that if you find the right group of people and get in the right mood, it can be an absolute blast of a game. Chuck you own explanations in about why your Knight, for example, choose to sell the princess at the castle, got turned into a frog, is now physically weaker than The Farie and followed by a Hag, that just MIGHT be his mother...and the game can definitely fly.

Talisman was another game from my early teen years, which I liked quite a bit back then.  Now, I find it only ok, with some good parts but overall a very repetitive endgame that feels far too long.

This is the 2nd edition with "The City" expansion.  Very fun if you have a good chunk of a day to spend.  Talisman games tend to cause your ass to fall asleep from sitting so damn long.  As fun as the game is, most times our game group is so tired by the game end no one really cares who wins. Not a good sign... perhaps games should start earlier I guess.

I loved Talisman. Its been probably at least 16 or 17 years since I've played, but I still think its one of the most fun games I've played. Could get long sometimes with all the options and the near invincible character combos sometimes, but we still had a lot of fun.

Used to play this a lot in high school 2nd edition, friend of mine had it.  We'd pull it out on a gaming day when we were too lazy to run an RPG.  Was fun for a romp, it's slow to start but picks up steam in the end, the randomness can get annoying at times however.

Game play is slow, but my memories of hours spent playing this were always worthwhile.  Back in the 80's, we didn't have the glut that exists today.  New fantasy games may play better than this one, but it will always be my favorite!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
Based on 1 play with 5 players: This game is very, very mindless. Generally the only decision for players is which way they want to move at the beginning of their turn... and the choice is usually obvious. This game tries to deceive you into believing that you're doing meaningful things by constantly throwing various board space/card effects at you. The different cards and spaces add a lot of flavor to the game, probably in the hopes that you be so impressed by this that you'll turn a blind eye to the nearly nonexistent level of control in the game. The playing time is absurd, but it DOES mostly manage avoid the excruciating "when will it end?" feeling that sets in with most of these kinds of games due to all the things constantly happening. You could do worse for a mindless roll-and-move, but why bother when you could do so much better?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Just love the feel and the whole concept of this game. Definetly plays WAY too long. (we modified the rules to play faster by giving all heros like 4 more gold and ability points). If the game moved faster i would issue the 10!

RATING: 5
I've done this many time before.  Roll a die and choose between a few challenges.  Roll another die.  Thematic?  Yeah.  I never filt like there were any real tough choice and with only one die here or there, there was no real bell curve.  In the end, with all the choices I have now, this is dated.

(~10 alone, ~100 with various expansions)
This was the first game beyond family games like Monopoly, Risk, and Scrabble that I got "into".  Until my discovery of Euros (Settlers was the first) this was by far my favourite game.  Nowadays it's been replaced by games like Descent and Runebound.
Second edition is the way to go.  It has a very "raw" feel to it, reinforcing the "I don't know what will happen next" feeling that all fantasy games should have.
There is more skill involved than what appears at first glance to be a rather random game.  It is possible to be completely screwed over by certain cards, but that's part of the charm.  This is a dangerous world and we all take risks in order to succeed.
The game works best with 4-5 players, but 3 is fun, if less interactive.  Avoid playing with 2 unless interaction isn't important.  More than 6 is usually too long, though I've played with up to 11 at conventions.  To keep the game short, every 30 minutes everyone lost 1 life.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Very easy to design such a game. Take a game, change the theme and do new rules on top of it. 

What matters there is to come up with it. Congrats to GW's designers again. They did it and they succeeded.

My rating should be 9 or more, for the sheer fun of Talisman, but as I don't want to play it anymore, I lowered it.

Mostly nostalgia. Yes, it's unbalanced and flawed... but extremely fun. Get over it - you're not playing to win, are you? A creative mind could do some editing to the characters to make the game more balanced, if it were socially necessary.

The only time I played this was after Doug's 30th birthday party, a memorable event of unparalleled surprise, despair, and deception.  (If you ever read this, Doug, we really had no idea, really.  We were just in Redondo Beach completely randomly!)  It took much too long--I think we called the game because it hit 1am and most of us had to drive at least 45 minutes to get home--and wasn't terribly interesting by this decade's board game standards.  I think Doug, Gary, and/or Patty commented that it was much more fun 15 years earlier.  The dungeon expansion might've been thrown in also, but I'm not sure since we were all trying to learn/remember the rules.

This is the game I grew up with. Along with HeroQuest (and soon after, D&D) it brought me into modern day gaming culture way before it was ever a thing. Too bad I didn't realize until long after our new age was established! Of course, you'll never want to play this old verson now. Fantasy Flight has been handling its 4th edition, with new expansions and piece count, though its base game is a carbon copy of this precious gem from 1983, even down to the illustrations.

You hear people say "fantasy Monopoly" and in the sense that you roll and move and try to do the best with the spaces you land on, they are right.  But color and flash, character and story go a long way to making dreadfully dull real estate speculation into almost engaging fantasy quest.  This would be a truly great game if only there were some strategy to play... instead it's a race based on luck.

This is one of the most tedious, monotonous, interminable games I have ever had the unfortunate experience to play.  Roll and move, draw encounter card, repeat ad nauseum.

You know, I played this again recently for the first time in a decade and I realized how much I _missed_ it!  If German-style strategy games are the Messiah, then certainly this is the antichrist- almost everything in it has a random element.  But you know, the unpredictability and wild nature of it all is what made it so much fun to begin with.  There's a few strategic choices in there, but it's all about drawing cards and throwing dice, cheering when its good and groaning when it's bad.  This is truly a classic, a game that should always be in print and be played by nerds in a basement somewhere in the world at any given time.

I now own the revised fourth edition of this game. I still love this original as a classic, however I much prefer the new edition due to the adaptions that have been made. For example the fourth edition (although it could have happened earlier not having played the editions in between) balances out the previously overpowered prophetess with the revised orb of knowledge powers. It also reduces the effect of some of the nastier event cards (e.g. raiders are now more of an annoyance that a game changing event).

RATING: 3
Massively unbalanced.  Poorly written.  Unfun play.  Takes to long to play.  The best thing about this game was the genre - and even that is way too light for me.

At this point in time I think there are just too many other, better, games out there in this genre.  This does not withstand the test of time.

RATING: 5
This is an okay game. I take exception to the Saracen in one of the expansions being evil. It's disappointing about western fantasy that middle eastern ethnicities are so often dubiously represented. We see it in Tolkien, then in Talisman and Magic Realm, and lately in Battlelore.

One of the games, that I have fond memories of playing during my childhood. I get the urge to play this one from time to time, but this hardly last more than one or two turns. I feel so old writing this, but it's probably a 9 for adolescent boys (or a even a 10 in [thing=27627]the new edition[/thing]).

This was very fun in its day, and I've probably played Talisan nearly 100 times.  In the end, there aren't that many iteresting decisions to make, but the game is very well themed, and the lack of decisions doesn't always seem to matter.  Of greater concern are the expansions, which sometimes improve the game, but more often unbalance it and make it much, much longer.

RATING: 6
A luckfest, and very long. Haven&#039;t played it in a long time. But can be quite enjoyable in a role-playing kind of mindless way. We had great fun playing it at night on a camping trip way back when.  But don&#039;t expect to do any great thinking playing this.

RATING: 7.5
Classic dungeon crawler, highly expanded with official and fan created content. A lot of fun but can be brutal with heavy luck elements, mitigated by strategic planning. Best played with 3 or 4, further will increase downtime too much.

RATING: 6.5
Will always have a special place in my heart for all the countless hours I spent in my youth playing this as a distraction from D&D.  It has length issues, isn't remotely balanced, and the City expansion is completely broken (and I don't throw that term around lightly).  Probably best for 12-13 year olds who think Runebound is the be-all end-all of adventure games.

RATING: 7
They say Diablo is clickfest. If so, than Talisman must be his older board game sibling known as dicefest. I bet you roll the dice in this game more often than you need mouse clicks to sucesfully finish Diablo I. Everything; and I really mean absolutely EVERYTHING; in this game is conditional by rolling dice...

 Regardless this "little dice issue" it´s fun, which is strange because Talisman is very badly scale, too long, there isn´t much to do after few first sessions, most expansion just fill it with useless garbage and in fact somewhere in the core of the game it´s just "ludo with RPG elements". But Talisman can also be fun light family RPG game for all ages with lots of player´s interactions (if enough people around table); just not for long period of time.

 PS: Yes, I realize that this comment doesn´t sounds as a 7 game and I would rate it much lower, if this wasn´t one of my first proper board games. So somewhere deep in my heart in nostalgia corner, there is special place for Talisman Second Edition.

RATING: 7
Talisman is the sort of game that Games Workshop should have invested more time in producing over the last couple of years.  The game has a simple mechanic, simple combat, simple advancment system and simple victory conditions.  The near-infinitly different possible combinations of characters and items, added to the excitement of the table-talk and interaction between the players keep this a firm favourite.

RATING: 6.5
Own the 2nd edition and doubt I'll ever acquire a 4th edition copy. Yes, other games are better (Prophecy, Runebound, etc) relative to Talisman's flaws, but I can't help it, I love this game. Maybe it's only for nostalgia's sake. The runaway leader issue has certainly ended more games prematurely than not, but it's great when an actual race among the players emerges.

Yes, it can go long, but I love this game.  It should be played for the experience that it is and not so much for strategy, because the randomness makes it difficult to execute anything other than short term goals.  But it is also this randomness that gives the game tremendous replay value.  My rating includes all expansions.  WARNING: Rating likely inflated due to nostalgia.

I never played this growing up, but I remember seeing it in the store and dreaming about one day owning and playing it.  So when I got back into boardgaming, I got crazy and bought 2 copies.  What was I thinking?   This game is silly simple, boring, and all-luck-based.  I guess it may have been fun for kids in the 80s.  I truly missed my chance to enjoy it.  My last playing, was pure agony.  It was like being forced to play Chutes & Ladders for 5 hours.  I absolutely refuse to ever be roped into playing this game.  Finally sold the 2 copies.  I'd rate it a 1, but the game isn't "broken" so that would be unfair.

Poorest example of "turn-a-RPG-into-a-boardgame" ever. Roll dice to move a character. Take a card. Do what it says. Wait for your turn. Repeat for two hours of pointless boredom.

If anyone else out there wants to join in my class-action lawsuit to regain the hours you wasted on this one, email me...

I honestly believe I've played this 150+ times. My cousin had it, and I could not believe the scale of the game: dozens of characters hundreds of adventures, gold chits, woohoo. So I got it too. I played it all the time in my teens with my brother and it was a blast. On returning, we found it was our company that provided for the blast, since the game stinks (sorry, I consider myself an AT fan but I just won't play this anymore). There are rants enough on the geek about this, and they're all true. I see they republished it now. Too bad. It would have become legend. Our copy now rests in an old pretzel cardboard box, since the original one fell apart. Kind of like Donny and the Folgers can in the Big Lebowski...

Talisman is such a great game - yes, its all about luck, the game is unbalanced and the rules are fiddly; all of which adds to its charm! This is a FUN game, plain and simple, which is why it remains so popular some 20+ years post-release (but the Timescape sucks!!)

I think the game's a true classic and I had a lot of fun playing this with my college buddies.  As long as you're in no hurry when you play, this can be a great time.  We had a house rule that you had to take off your pants for the duration of your time as a Toad to suitably add to the humiliation.

UPDATE:
These days I need to be in the right mood to enjoy this one, but I still appreciate it for what it is, and the nostalgia love remains strong.

I still have a copy of the original version of this game. God, we played this to death. a simple enough game, that really could last a LONG time to play. The expansions helped to make it a faster game. This game is a little overbalanced in the luck direction, which is why it can take so long to finish.

Is Talisman a game? This is a conversation my friends and I have every time we sit down to play (which is only once every two years or so). I don't mean that as a real inquiry into the nature of play, but basically as a joke concerning our loose affection for the game despite our realization that, as a game, it is quite boring. It's largely non-interactive and offers very little to do in terms of decision making for players. "Fantasy Monopoly," as people call it. I guess a lot of games look like this now - with the rise of deck-building games that are basically semi-private exercised hidden under the guise of meta-interaction - but Talisman really feels like a an apparatus of mechanics that the player goes through (rehearses?) while maybe enjoying the flavor along the way. As such, rather than a game, I tend to think of it as something that happens in the room as two or more people are doing something else that requires more of their attention (conversing, drinking, breathing, etc). 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
This game is a lot of fun and very involving. Although there is a lot of randomness in this game, which makes for a very different game every time, there are many decisions to make where you can take known risks. This means you can build up slow and steady or you can be an aggressive risk taker and (possibly ) overtake the player in the lead. I have played many games where I have snatched victory from the jaws of defeat or conversely gone down in a blaze of glory. It is a long game but one I want to play any time I have the time.

Used to play this a fair bit when young(er); one of my kids (aged 10 now - but started playing it aged 8) is now keen on it, so I think it suits that mind set - like a more complex roll and move game, giving a satisfying experience. And of course you get to become powerful and able to slaughter dragons which is nice at any age.

Owned this game, but someone stole it from my collection back in 1997 while I was moving.  Never did figure out who took it.  A fun game with an odd ending.  Played it quite a bit, but friends of mine did not like the ending and wouldn't play it again.

Strange footnote:  played the game "Rat Race" yesterday. Kind of liked the game.  Throughout playing I kept thinking, "This would make for an interesting game if you changed it to a fantasy/medieval based game, introduced characters such as Peasants, Knights, Magic users, etc.  I thought that could be done quite easily, although you would have to change the ending so it wouldn't be like Rat Race and then it dawned on me.  If you did that you would have game extremely close to Talisman.  I'll bet the designers came up with the basic idea and game board layout from the game Rat Race.  They had to change the ending because it would be too obvious that it was a fantasy/medieval version of Rat Race.  A number of my friends stated at the time that the obvious ending to Talisman should have been the winning player should be the first player to collect 100,000 gold pieces... just like Rat Race (except Rat Race was in dollars).

RATING: 5
Played this alot back in the day. But even then it wore out it's welcome.  Lots of great theme elements but gameplay was slow, tedious and no player interaction.  Any game where players consistently start their turn before the last person is finished, needs some tweaking.

RATING: 7
I feel like I should love this game, but it's the nostalgia coming through. I've had many fun games, but often the bubble bursts and you're sat around watiing for an overlong dice fest to reach it's end (especially if you are with players too timid to try for the Inner region).

RATING: 3
No, it's not great in terms of mechanics. Yes, it's long and has loads of downtime. But if all you want is a dungeon delve, then it's the game for you. Less than 4 players is uninteresting, more than 4 makes the game unfinishable. Play with 4, and there's a decent chance for a payoff if no one wastes time and you keep moving even while screaming for blood at the top of your lungs. Don't expect much of a GAME though.

RATING: 5
Suffers from the same problem that many fantasy quest games have: too long, too random. There are simply very few meaningful choices to make in this game. Most of the appeal comes from the theme, which is, to be fair, tremendously executed.

Nice old game with many editions. Easy to learn but terribly repetitive. Nice as an introduction game but nothing more. It's like snakes and ladders with some different rules, a sense of "doing something" but nothing more.

As a fan of Arkham Horror I don't think I can go back to Talisman, but there was a time (admittedly it was when I was in middle school, but, hey, that's a time) when this was the best game ever.  Today I find it to be overly long, wildly unbalanced, and the competitive angle doesn't do as much for me, but it's still entertaining to break out from time to time, provided everyone knows what they're getting into.  Thankfully, I have the 2nd Edition, which contains all (well, most) of the errata the game needs while still maintaining the wonderful old-school Games Workshop house illustration style the new editions lack.

Beloved game, because its one of the first serious (non-monopoly) games I own way back in the 80s.  I remember many fun hours during early high school with this game.  Wouldn't want to play it anymore, just a little too random and simple.  But if you happen to have a group that loves fantasy & want a brainless random low attention good time, its actually not a bad choice.

RATING: 9
Great game.  I've owned this since I was about 13 years old (I'm 29 now) and always have a great time playing this with friends.  The later expansions really swelled the game to behemoth levels.  I really recommend only playing with one or two expansions at a time (and the last expansion, Dragons really  made the game too difficult if you drew those cards early in the game.  I'd love to seperate all the expansions again and make up some new houserules for using them.  And every expansion fits completely in the original 2nd edition box.  Blissful fantasy boardgaming.  Too good.  By itself its definitely worth a 9 for all the fun I've ever had with this game.  (put in all the expansions and try and play and its somewhere around a 6).

Sept 2007 - Game Length is experience dependant.  Last 3-player game was finished in <1hr.  Expect it to take a lot longer if you're not playing with someone who's played 100  times.  How much longer? Like 3hrs.  And it's honestly not worth that large of a time investment.

RATING: 9
The quintessential dungeon crawling board game. If you enjoy a game that will never play the same twice (because of the way characters are determined and the way the board changes as characters cross it) with high quality artwork and a fantasy flair, then do what you can to find this game.

If you don&#039;t like a fantasy based game or don&#039;t like games that force you into a strategic battle with a supercomputer, then I would recommend that you pass on this game.

This game is a polarizing one.. You&#039;ll either like it or hate it.

I happen to like this alot when I&#039;m looking for some beer and pretzels fun.

The only reason I didn&#039;t give it a 10 is that I feel that the game doesn&#039;t reach the best it can be without adding the Adventure and Expansion supplements (which add oodles more characters and cards and different ways to end the game).

This is probably the game I have played the most of and never get tired of.  GWs best IMHO.  Okay have to edit this one after playing it recently.  This game live on fondly in my memories but actual gameplay doesn't compare to those memories.  It's still a fun game but the mid game is very long and actually gets boring.  Compaired to more modern Fantasy rpg simulations like Runbound, this just doesn't compair except in nostalgia factor.

The first game I can say that I loved.  Endlessly bothering my parents for games may have prompted them to have another child.  Added bonus: when my brother was born, my mum gave me the Talisman miniatures set so I didn't feel left out.  I thank the stars that none of the lead pieces ever found their way into my baby brother's colon.

A "love it or hate it" game that I neither love nor hate.  You don't make too many big decisions, but watching everything play out can be fun.  Role-players will tend to like it.

I love this game! 2nd ed. There is nothing like falling into the thick of chaos once in awhile. I have played it often and it is fully in shape and intact (No pieces missing). I am looking for a home for it now. I am not a "collector" but I think this is worth some money at this point. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
Over-long, and more so with each expansion added. Charmingly rickety and eccentric, but ultimately heavily luck-based, with only a binary choice to make each turn (although to be fair, you are often deliberately navigating towards a specific space, to get the special effect, or discarded item there). It's also peppered with arbitrary and random events as the outcomes of said choices.

In short, it was OK when we had far fewer hobby games to choose from (in the 80s), and more time (I was a teenager) but it's a waste of good gaming time nowadays. The expansions tend to magnify the game's problems.

Roll to move. Roll to attack. Character classes have random lists of one-off cards that don't affect them for theme reasons. The game doesn't nudge people toward an end-- players who don't know any better will make this last even longer than it needs to.

Used to own 2nd edition, and seem to have liked the artwork better than 3rd, which I now own.  Wish I'd never "lent" it out.  It never returned./ :(

UPDATE:  Booyah, scored a super cheap copy of 2nd edition complete with the first 2 expansions! Whoa!  Overall the production value on the new FFG 4th edition is significantly better, however for it's time, 2nd edition was a nice production, also.  I'm glad to have both editions now.  2nd edition wins points for having a smaller more managable board (4th really needs some space, especially once you add the Dungeon expansion).  2nd also scores points for the vintage Games Workshop art, which I've always liked.  It also scores points for the nice compact box, that won't hog shelf space.  2nd + 1st 2 expansions fit nicely in base game box and is no bigger than a standard Avalon Hill bookshelf game.

4th wins points for modern production values, gorgeous art, included minis (even though I kind of liked the original's standees), pretty dice, plastic coins and cones (for tracking stats).  If you've no nostalgia for 2nd edition or vintage Games Workshop and have a large flat playing area, you'll want the new FFG 4th edition.  


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Like Warlock of Firetop Mountain, it's nostalgia that's pushing the score up for this one as much as anything for me. But despite its dated mechanics and the fact it almost always outstays its welcome, the fun of building your character into a badass never gets old. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Nostalgia for high school and college aside, the game is thematic but slightly moronic. You move around the board and draw a card to see what happens to you. Roll dice to see if you succeed in your attempt. Repeat. The player-vs-player aspect adds fun but makes things needlessly cutthroat. The expansions generally heap more chaos on to the game, adding theme but not much in the way of gameplay. The game takes a long time and you spend most of it sitting around waiting for your turn. I never play this game anymore, but I'll keep it to remind me of the days when I just didn't know any better than to play Talisman.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Easy to learn. Quick set-up. With the expansions, the game changes enough to remain interesting (The Dragons Expansion is a must; and rating reflects game with "Dragons" expansion).  One of my groups favorite games for many years.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
A neat classic... but I don't think that I have a strong desire to play it anytime soon.  For a dungeon crawl, it can get pleasantly silly, but it also seemed to become repetitive long before the game actually ended.  Not as fiddly as some more recent dungeon crawls.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Go left or go right?

Enjoy making that decision? You better, because it's what you'll be doing almost the entire time you play (and it's usually obvious which is preferable). If Talisman lasted 45 minutes, this would be acceptable since it's pretty good at creating a narrative and would make a good beer-and-pretzels game. But it lasts far longer than that. And if you're so foolish as to add the expansions? Oy vey!

Talisman isn'ta terrible game for the first hour or so, it's just that it quickly drags on after that and you get to a point where you just want the game to end. Decent theme, decent play mechanics, it just can get too cumbersome for what it is especially if you start adding in all the expansions.

Magia i Miecz jest tym od czego zaczęła się moja przygoda z grami planszowymi i moje zainteresowanie fantasy.
Jednym z ważniejszych czynników były wspaniałe ilustracje Grzegorza Komorowskiego.

Dzisiaj, po latach mój zwiazek z tą serią jest bardzo trudny. Mimo że mam do niej wielki sentyment to rozgrywka jest dla mnie za słaba. Cały czas poszukuję gry która miałaby klimat Magii i Miecza, a jednocześnie potrafiła się obronić ze strony mechanicznej.

I discovered Talisman accidentally several years ago when I ran into a copy at a fleamarket. I wasn't particularly interested in boardgames, but Talisman cought my attention because of the cover art. Honestly, I still remember the day I opened the box and started browsing through piles of cards and character sheets. It soon became obvious that I had to buy it, no matter what. What's keeping me from giving this game the highest rating, is the length. I very rarely have time to play games lasting 4-5 hours. My current rating comes from the game's atmosphere, art and simplicity. It's a classic.

This is it.  The one that started the boardgaming addiction for me.  A friend joined the navy after high school and gave me his copy (which included all expansions except for dragons and City, which hadn't come out yet and i got later).  Yes, it is roll and move.  Yes it can go on too long.  Yes, it is too cluttered for any table in my home, but in the words of Gen. George S. Patton; "God help me, I do love it so."  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3.5
Here is how to simulate playing Talisman:  1) find attractive fantasy art to look at. 2) start rolling a d6.  On a 4 or 5, you get +1 point.  On a 6, you get +5.  On a 1, you get -20.  3) First player to 100 points wins!  Enjoy the art, you'll be staring at it for a while.

Greatly overrated in my opinion.  Roll the dice, move your piece, collect lots of stuff.  The choices boil down to which space to move to and are usually obvious.  It's usually obvious who's going to win the game (the person who's carrying the most stuff) long before the game ends.

RATING: 5
I played this years ago, another game perhaps that is merely easy to write off as a dice fest. At some point think this is unfair, it isn't truly terrible or anything like that, but for me there are so many more interesting, if more complex game. Magic realm, which provides wonderful chrome with a very clever battle system and interesting incentives, blows this out of the water. Sure Talisman is simple and easy enough to play, but barring sillyness from the group it doesn't provide me with a real intellectual challenge, that isn't to say there is no skill, there is, but in terms of over all feel, it falls flat for me. For nostalgia sake sure, with a good group of friends, perhaps as a diversion, with serious gamers, I'll be playing magic realm, which is probably shorter anyway.

In my distant past, I played this a few times. The goofy monsters and events were amusing for a while, but not really much of a game. I like the general Talisman concept of random encounters gradually working your way up to the big bad, but now there are several quasi-Talisman games that do the job better.

Still a roll and move game but you do have some choices.
11-27-2009: Changed my rating to a 1 (from a 6) because GW had BGG remove ALL user generated files. There was some great stuff by fans that GW thinks infringes on their intellectual property.  The fan generated stuff promote and support their games.  It seems that all GW cares about is getting your money and then you are on your own.

RATING: 5
A favourite game for many members of my roleplaying group in the late 80s. However, I was not so keen on it as my less than encyclopaedic knowledge of the characters and cards seemed to place me at a disadvantage. The prophetess was soon banned as being too powerful a character. I never owned the game myself (I regret this now, given its collectability) but I do have a metal miniature of the prophetess!

RATING: 7
Strategic. Yes, strategic. Luck, too, of course, plays a role. The die rolls and card pulls do balance over time, so consistently knowing when and where to position yourself is of high importance.
Think (oddly enough) backgammon. Lots of dice rolling, but the better player usually wins. With Talisman, the better player does even better than that game, because killer instinct is mandatory here.

Not a game to play with slow thinkers, no killer instinct or more than 3 (too much down time)--the game WILL bog down.

Talisman is no Euro Game, to be sure, but it can be a lot of fun--lots of neat items and events--especially if you like fantasy themes.

After struggling to run (and play) D&D campaigns, this was a revelation, drawing me into a fantasy world for enough time to get invested in the characters and loose myself in the normally non-confrontational simple race. It's still played occasionally; with the Adventure expansion it's got enough variety, even though there's a couple of cards you know you want to come up. The Priestess remains banned, though.

Nerd Monopoly, with all the good and bad that implies. Would be up for playing a game of it when I see the friend I used to play it with in high school. Otherwise, I'll go with Prophecy, and keep trying to hunt down The Quest For Shangri-La.

RATING: 6
Tali-bloop?  Beer and pretzels supremo.  With the original game+"Adventure" and experienced sober players, the 1st player to the crown of command loses!  (So it needs a few house rules and ejecting some overpowered things.)  "Dungeon" adds extra yummy randomness.  I Acquired City and don't like it.

I can't decide if I think Talisman is "light" or "medium" so I've put "light-medium" even though I'm sure it isn't!

RATING: 4
I remember having a lot of fun with this in times gone by, albeit there's not really a great deal of game there.

It's Dungeons and Dragons in a friendly boardgame package. Simple basic system (throw the dice and move that number of spaces, pick up a card from the appropriate deck and act upon it) with (some) depth added through the use of large card decks. There were a lot of expansion packs which mainly clogged up the basic concept with unnecessary detail.

I've been so frustrated with this game.  My experience has been numerous games where it goes on forever and ever since all opponents tend to gang up on anyone coming close to winning.  As a result, no one wins and the game goes on and on, much longer than the projected hour or two that the game designers claim.  It's been years since I've played it.

7.8.2007: There's just nostalgia in this game. If you played Talisman as a child or teenager and have fond memories of it, then you probably like it. For the rest of you, don't bother. Too much downtime, too random. If you want a decent Talisman-like game, play Runebound 2nd edition (it also suffers from downtime and randomness, but at least you have some control over your fate).

Talisman is the game that got me back into gaming and i have mixed feelings about it. I thoroughly enjoyed it once-upon-a-time, but i've since discovered simpler games that don't take as long and have a much higher replay value. It's a good game to bring out and play over a few beers, but there's no grand strategy and not really enough player interaction. High nostalgia rating though!  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Talisman: 

I learned to love the art style of John Blanche over time but the game itself I outgrew quiiiite a bit. 

You choose one of the many many characters to embark on a quest for the kingdoms crown of command. 
All the while you encounter dangers, treasures friends and foes, all personified as cards you draw when stepping on a new tile of the board. Surviving th events and collecting and keeping the right loot and allies makes you grow stronger. And the one who grows stronger the fastest (most of the time the luckiest player) has the highest chance of winning the game. 
This game is prone to randomness as much as anything can get. As a player, you mostly decide for the direction to go and what to keep or drop but not that much more, making you something more akin a spectator or passive reader rather than the acting protagonist of the game happening. 
Also, it can develop a tendancy to drag a bit due to the possibility of unlucky chains of rolls happening... 

If you don't mind that and just want to see a neat story evolving by dice rolling and card drawing a lot, this might be a game for you. With the truckload of cards and colourful events happening and a comprehensible and simple rules-set it is also easy enough for kids to keep them entertained and engaged.

For people interested in being more in control of their fate, though, it's better to drop that thing in favour of more recent adventure game titles.

In a magical kingdom, the great question is "do I go left or right?" And the great worry, "do I roll higher than X statistic?", is ever round the corner (until 3 hours in when you have strength 20).

The 8 is probably influenced by nostalgia. A lot of people rip on this game but it deserves it's due. It was the first of it's kind and what it did it did superbly. A roleplaying game without all the complexity and fiddliness. I admit that it hasn't held up all that well over the years, at one time I would have given this a 10. Still an 8 is more than respectable and this is a good gateway game. I'll still play it whenever someone asks.

One of those games I enjoyed so many years ago.  A friend of mine had it, with the first expansion, and we played it more than a few times.  I really liked the idea of having a different character for each player, without having to create one in a complete paper-and-pencil roleplaying game environment.  Travelling around the fantasy world of Talisman was fun, too, and play wasn't nearly as random and decision-less as some have made it out to be (although there are random elements involved, of course).

A lighthearted dicefest about adventuring in a magical world. The rules are simple, the board is surprisingly detailed and the cards are varied and rich with theme. Artwork (for 2nd edition) was well-done. The game was very easy to pick-up and play.

Unfortunately for the amount of randomness, the game runs too long. This game would be perfect at 90 minutes, it runs twice that. There is also quite a bit of text on the cards which can slow down the game. The counters are fiddly and hard to manipulate. And the replayability without expansions is low because you can run through the entire adventure deck in a game.

I finally got to play this which I've been wanting since the 80s. Alas, much like I discovered with Dungeonquest, it's really not that much fun for me. It felt too much like Wiz-War, just a lot more random with less combat between players. I guess I like either team play, co-op, or versus games more than 'solitaire' style games which explains why Wiz-War will always fill this 'random' niche for me and receives a much higher rank. I loved the production values of Talisman, but the game play just didn't make me want to come back for more.

Chaotic stuff. Not for a serious gamer. Everything is random, and nothing is balanced. But maybe that is what attracts in this classic. It's so different. One of the most nostalgic classics in my books.

RATING: 6.5
An old fantasy classic.  Gives you a little taste of an old-school fantasy RPG in a board game.  There are now better games to fill this slot, but this was probably the best of its genre once upon.  This biggest flaw was the ending of this one... it can drag on.  I do admit that whenever I played it, all I then really wanted to do was play some REAL D&D.  lol
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
THE game when I was 13-14. Never owned it, but always very keen to play. More so than the owners, which says something. Never quite lived up to expectations, but seemed very 'open' and ripe for replay. Now more aware of the flaws, obviously, but remains an important developmental milestone.

Played the heck out of this game when I got it and then some more over the years. I really got tired of the 1-3 is bad and 4-6 is good on the die rolling with some creative theme centered around this constant. I sold my copy along with every expansion that was made for this edition for $500.00 when I knew they were re-printing it before the bottom fell out of the demand :)

A game with some really fun elements in the Dungeons and Dragons mold -- go around fighting monsters and having encounters to build up your character. The schtick gets old just a little before the game ends, but overall pretty good. Better for teenagers than adults, in my opinion.

I know a lot of people like this one but it always dragged on a long time and basically there wasn't much strategy about winning, it was more down to the luck of how you got around the board and what cards you picked up.

Pretty much a souped-up fantasy Snakes & Ladders.

RATING: 8
This was my first "serious" board game when I was a kid. It grasped me with it's incredible feel created mostly by the artwork (which was different from the original one in the Polish edition). The adventure feeling that it created is unforgettable. During almost two decades I've played the game hundreds of times. Nowadays it isn't that fun any more. There are no important decisions to make - probably the most important one is "should I go left or right this turn", other decisions are mostly very obvious. Game heavily depends on luck.

It´s simple and many people say it´s just a gate-game for newbies. Well it was for me when I was young. But it is still one of the best fantasy-boardgames I ever played. It IS the simplicity and elegant game mechanism that makes me love it. The character management, well, it isn´t nearly as interesting as in WoW:BG and there is no such storyline like in Runebound - but it has cool character arche types, you can use items and magic spells, the game is fast paced... and there isn´t that much of downtime like in WoW or Runebound. Complexity is not always the best way. The game can be as long as WoW or Runebound (the endgame...) - but the player actions are done a LOT faster. Or said in other words: You play the same time as with WoW or RB, but you have done much more WITHIN this time... Well, if there wasn´t that much of randomness and luck... but that was the feeling of games in the 1980s :) I still like it for casual play.

One of my first boardgame...I got it when i was 10 years old and still enjoy playing it. I recently acquire some of the extensions (city,adventure, timescape)wich make the game more interesting despite the price you have to pay on ebay.
the game is a luxurious "jeu de l'oie", a french game with a single track and two dice. But the simplicity of the game is its strengh !
The nice draws on the card and the board contribute to make this game a true classic.
You can play this game with your whole family because of the easy rules and the atractivity of the game.
A must have.

I will admit that when I played this as an adult after a long hiatus, I found it kinda repetitive.  But so much for impartiality . . . as a teenager my friends and I played this to DEATH.  The board and characters were so beautifully and evocatively illustrated, they made Talisman as atmospheric as any game I've ever played.  And it was always fun, again and again.  Just magic.

Contrary to popular belief, strategy does actually have a little influence on the outcome of the game, and I have some game records as evidence.

As expansions get added, the game can get a little bogged down, losing some thematic focus.  House rules can help smooth out some imbalances as well.

However, I'm very rarely in the mood to play Talisman anymore, and the game can really slow down with new players and/or too many people.  At one point, my cousin, my brother, and I had the spaces and cards nearly all memorized, so we could play a speedy game, but with all of our expansions, that still took a few hours.  These days, I think I could have much more fun with other games in the same amount of time.

RATING: 6
The game board represents a fantasy land. Players chose a character from a list of semi-standard fantasy types: Barbarian, Wizard, Monk, etc. The objective of the game is to travel through the land encountering event cards and gathering strength along the way. Hopefully players will eventually become powerful enough to travel to the center of the board, endure the trials there and take the Crown of Command for the victory. There were also several expansions released for this game, which add new character choices and new places to travel.

RATING: 3
Can't stand Talisman. The theme is great but there is far too much luck and the game is waaaaay too long. Played it a lot in the 80s when it was released and there wasn't much alternative so it does retain a certain nostalgia value for me.

1:st edition with expansion. Before Roborally and Settlers there was Talisman. Nothing I feel like playing anymore nowadays but I've had lots of fun with it even though the vague rules (anyone knows how spellcasting works?), unbalanced/annoying cards (Horse), unbalanced characters (I'm a monk and I've decided I want to kill you!) and games that never seem to end (More fun just collecting stuff, than actually finishing the game). To ease some of the chaos I usually played it with 'only allowed to move clockwise around the board'.

An enjoyable adventure board game, with an excellent feel of gathering companions, collecting magic spells, fighting beasts, and so on.  Beware of the expansions — They add interesting new opponents, but Games Workshop mysteriously forgot to include cards which increase Strength or Craft.  The result is a game which takes much, much longer than the original.  If you’d like to speed up the expansions or add more interesting quests to the game, I’d recommend the variant on my web page (see the “Lindsey’s Talisman variant” link here on BoardGameGeek).

One of the more imaginative "Old Skool" roll and move games that frequently had players nearly apoplectic when they yelled "Surrender or die!"

This is one of the best random based go-round-collecting-stuff games simply due to the variety of things you can encounter.

2nd edition is THE classic fantasy game.  Plays like an RPG.  Surprising variability from the colossal Adventure deck.  Works best with the 2 card expansions.

This is a fun game if you have 5 to 7 hours to blow with a dice fest.

I enjoyed this in high school (a "9" then) but today, there are so many other games I'd play instead.  It takes to long and the outcome is essentially random.  

It's more about the fun of the journey than who wins.

But god this game is crazy long sometimes.  It's not "munchkin" (which is technically shorter but feels longer).  If it ended in 3 hours it would be bearable (unlike munchkin).  So it's like 2 hours of fun crammed into 6 hours instead of 30 minutes of fun crammed into 3 hours.

Rating after one game with two players.  This was the second edition without expansions. The game seemed to revolve around which player lost all of their stuff, either to the raiders or by means of getting turned in to a toad.  Not a bad little game, but certainly nothing to write home about either.  I certainly won't ask to play it again, unless the other choices are pretty dire.

The game which started my attraction with alternative board games. Played it at school, at home, with friends. Loved it. Ended up selling it for 75 quid on ebay because as much as I loved it then it was a boring game now.

I hate to do this to all of y'all who are trying to find this game and not pay through the nose for it, but I was gifted with it and nearly all of the expansions last night.  When I asked a friend's wife what it would take to get her to part with her copies, she replied: "You picking them up and putting them in your car."  I now have Talisman, Talisman Adventure, Talisman Dungeon, Talisman Timescape, Talisman City, and Talisman Dragons for FREE.  Here that sound?  It's my heels clicking together...

I haven't played this game in a long time.  It is an interesting game especially with the expansions.  The game can get a little dull once someone get into the interior and is able to attack all the other players.  It can become a slow death for everyone else.  The different characters with their different strengths and weaknesses makes the game interesting.

A great game that really captures the spirit of an RPG in a boardgame with a sense of humor. There's a fairly high luck factor and a little strategy. You can't take this game too seriously, but playing is just plain fun. The mechanics are bit outdated by today's standards, but it's just silly fun.

I have fond memories of playing this as a teen. 12-16 hour weekends of Talisman 1st edition (with four 2nd edition expansions) were not uncommon. At the time, definitely a 9.

Compared to today's Euro games, it has lost some of its shine. The game has a chunk of luck / randomness ('beer and pretzels'). It runs a little long (the expansions make this worse). The end game can drag if no-one goes for the Crown of Command (again, the expansions make this worse). There is a significant runaway leader problem (particularly if the leader has high strength).

But, hey, its a fun game. With many fond memories.

Though this game can be fun, it's a dicefest.  You take your turn, encounter something, roll dice to see if you get past it, then pass the dice afterwards. Too much downtime between players.  And there are too many ambiguous rules.  The timing of spells, for example, is really shady.

Back in the day I really loved this game it was one way to get my friends to play something other than D&D.   It always felt like I was in the middle of an adventure.  Of course then I was a dreamer, and I've grown up.  Still reccomended for the younger crowd (as long as they can fork out the cash to buy it).  UPDATE: Bumped rating down 1 point due to it's huge playing time and emphasis on luck.

Gah, what an annoying game. Don't get me wrong, I love it to bits (many happy hours have been spent playing this with the family), but it does take a loooong time to get just the right kit you need to make that dash for the Crown. Still, with the right company, and the right amount of snacks and alcohol, it can be a scream. Looks very pretty as well!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This is a game that expanded so much that the game itself got muddied in the process.  The original Talisman was a pretty good game; not the strategy fest that some would like, but definite beer and pretzels (or in our case beer and pizza) fare.  I used to play this game a lot in college, but as more and more expansions were added, it just became too much to handle.  Some characters in the expansion seemed too powerful, and the Talisman City seemed a place for people to simply waste time rather than go and win the game.

If you don't mind a game that seems to take forever but not really end anywhere, then the older Talisman versions are the ones to own.  That said, the original game (without expansions) is my favorite of the bunch.

(Edit 4/2007):  Well, if you've seen my Top 10, you're probably wondering why this game is there.  The answer is simple:  a game's rating doesn't have the amount of impact as to whether the game hits the table or not.  Even though it's got a ton of flaws and I'm still "so-so" on it now, it's a classic game that I've played a ton of times and is still worth playing with my old gang from college.

If this game took 45 minutes, it might be sort of fun.  But it takes 4-5 hours.  Not fun, though we did play it a lot in college.  I wish I had one of these to sell on eBay, though.  If you can't afford this one on eBay, pick up Zombies- it is just about as pointless and costs a lot less.  Plus, who knows, it will probably go out of print someday and you might be able to sell it to some poor fool for an absurd sum.

Possibly the best paper/card based Games Workshop game, just because its family friendly and requires little in the way of serious white matter burning.

Its essentially a non-gamers' roll and move fantasy adventure game, but there's plenty of daft fun to be had which more then makes up for its lame roll-and-move-and-roll gameplay and the fact that it CAN go on for anywhere up to 7 hours or more!

Its best used as a gamers party game- get some drinks and munch in, have a laugh and don't take it too seriously. Its not about winning, its about laughing when all your stuff is nicked by raiders and then you run into a dragon. What happens then? Well you go to the tavern and get blind drunk in the corner, that's what!

Played the heck out of this in my late childhood and early teens. I'd only play this (and its reprints) for minor nostalgia value but wouldn't rush to play this today due to its interminable length.

Just for memories and time spent on it, I shoul've given Talisman a 10. I've played it recently again however, and I've to admit it has not aged well. It's a fun game, but it's more fun with many people, and in that case the game can drag a lot. Best played among experienced players, since they can cut downtime to the minimum. Good, great, but not really worth its current mad price.

Absolute classic. A part of history, my childhood. Great memories, very keen on playing this with friends who also have that memories. Simple mechanics allows to feel free on the board. Fredom is the key with addition of good music and scenery (medieval themed music + candles) - the game became very intresting and can act very well on imagination. I developed several heroes, also expansion called "The Inn". Part of my LIFE!

I love the little fantasy world this game envelopes me in.  Yes, there is no HUGE strategy session here, but this game was a huge bright spot in my life as a child.  The world and story this game delivers is very enjoyable for me.  Yes, roll and move, but what fun fantasy theme adventure!

I had most of the expansions to this edition originally, and I made the mistake of leaving them at a friends house when I was about 13.  A year or two later we got into a fight and I never saw my copy of Talisman again.  As an adult I heard that he was a server at a restaurant near me, so I decided to seek out my Talisman by bringing it up to him and tipping him over $50.  Never saw him again.

Than at 27, I heard the curmudgeon that originally introduced the game to me was moving from his house that he grew up in and was having a Garage Sale.  I got back my original 2nd ed. with Dungeon, Adventure, and City expansions for 2 bucks!  

Just need the Timescape and Expansion set to have my original collection back.

Incredibly fond of this game, but it can take so much time to play!  Some cards overbalanced, but there is so much luck in this game that it feels like it balances out...

Also: Prophetess is in the "broken" hall of fame for her insane abilities compared to other characters.

I have owned and played this game for many years. Roll and move.  Light on strategy and skill, heavy on luck.


The first couple expansions are a must as they add more cards, but the Dungeon and Timescape additions are rather useless and often just prolong the game.  [I don't own the City or Dragons, but I believe they are rather useless as well, unless you are looking to unecessarily prolong an already long game].  The game is fun to dig out maybe once or twice a year, as for me the game has lost all of its sense of "adventure" and novelty.  Unbalanced characters and items (which house-rules are required to deal with).  The wife and several friends like it, we play once or twice a year.  Can be a long game, the more players, the longer it is, with lots of downtime.  3 or 4 players is ideal.  Any more than that is just way too long.

I can appreciate the nostalgia value on this one, but not much else besides it. It's not a very original comment, but nonetheless: good idea, boring game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
The gameplay is in the stories and events within the game (which is a simple, often frustrating roll and move). If you're prepared to go along with the twists and turns of the game and accept a Curse of the Hag with the same grace as a Runesword then it's a fun game.

However it does go overlong, especially with players unprepared to risk all by building up their characters to some superhuman level. The expansions are generally worthwhile additions providing an increase in choice and adventure (often tho, for a commensurate increase in play time)

At the end of the day there are games I'd now rather play but it remains on hand if we fancy a blast of nostalgia

Love it. Just a great game to hang out partying with like-minded friends. 

Complete 2nd ed. Came with the 1st expansion, The Adventure Expansion and City expansion.

Was $25 and behind the counter at a thrift store. I didn't know if anything was complete as it was all a big jumble in the base set box. Very glad I took the chance. 

One of the highlights of my thrifting adventures spanning over a 10 year period. An absolute grail find for me. This is one of the very few I wanted to find the most. Only took 10 years!

Unfortunately broken game.  Had many good times and fun plays, but ultimately, once you have amassed a certain amount of power in the game, it ceases to be a challenge.  Also this game has a tendency to drag on and on because the clear winner wants to hang about and amass more treasure instead of simply winning.

Complete. 2nd Edition.

My "Old Faithful" boardgame that never fails to draw players at conventions.  I have played this game too many times to count.  I absolutely love it.

While the core game is solid and enjoyable enough on its own, gameplay is greatly enhanced by expansions, most notibly the Dungeon and Adventure sets.  

Pyrogal's Talisman House Rules: For character selection, all players "go fish" for three face down character cards and pick one of the three to play.  I don't allow the Prophetess character as it is extremely unbalanced with its ability to see into the Adventure deck.

My first fantasy game was the GW 2nd Edition. I also bought the 3rd (which I never really liked) and do now own the 4th. Roll the dice, move, draw a card. That's it, basically, but how many cards are there? No game will be the same. This game is like an old whisky.

Ahhhh Talisman ... Pretty Nice game ... It ALOT better with all expansion ... 
Some house rules make the game alot better. Since the game wasnt planified at the begining with all expansion, some part of the game(characters or spells or cards) from the basic game are useless when you have all expansion ... and need to be removed or modified to be perfect.
My favorit character is the Astropath... too powerfull

I own the english second edition and also the french second edition from Gallimard (very rare)

I love randomness so this game is lots of fun, it feels more like a weird racing game than a crawler but the competitive aspect makes it fun, fighting and chasing other players. The most annoying thing is the movement mechanic and the board which can be quite hard to read depending on where you are sitting. The characters are very diverse (and many) which is amazing, sadly the diversity does not carry over to the enemies and items you can find, alas, I would have prefered more items to cause the game to go topsyturvy but I guess that would have thrown too many people of. Still, with the right people that can have a laugh, this game is fun.

The first time I played (in the mid 80's) this game was probably the best because I had no idea what the Adventure cards had in store of me as I have never seen them before. I would always seek to get a new Adventure card! I didn't even care about trying to win, and just wanted that next Adventure card. 

I liked the game so much I went out and bought it the next day. I still like getting Adventure cards, but my goal is the Crown of Command now.

Horrible, horrible game if you're actually somewhat serious about games having good mechanics.  I played this for the first time a couple days ago and couldn't wait for the game to end.  With 5 very aggressive players, a single game took 4.5 hours without even completely finishing.  The game is almost completely random with the only choice of the player going left or right on each turn.  I was doing well and wanted to attack other players, but was unable to do so for the whole time I played due to unlucky rolls.  Other players had the same issue.  I hope to never play this game again and absolutely do not understand the draw.

The first couple times I played this I really enjoyed it.  Then I found this game increasingly dull and long.  

Most of the time you roll the die, and have a choice of two spots.  Usually the choice is obvious.  So 95 to 98% of your turns, you have no interesting decision to make.  Also it is a turn based game so if there are 5 players, you are sitting on your butt for 80% of the time.  

The fact that some characters were unballanced hurts the game as well.  Wish I had a copy of the game so I could sell it!!!  :-)

A good game overrun by expansions. To be honest, even the main game suffers from wanting to drag out at the end, but the process of getting to that point is fun.

The fundamental solidity of the system is shown by the fact that the concept easily lent itself to the expansions, and they generally concentrated on the beginning and middle game, without trying to do much about the end game.

Fantasy game with atmosphere. Much luck involved through card drawing and dice rolling. Also it's an aggressive game because the goal is to kill the other players and so to be the only player left.

In the entire game I played, I made 3 actual choices.  3.  That's it.  That's roughly 1 per hour.  Seriously!?!

I'll give this a generous 3/10 because it is well balanced and manages to avoid stalemates or too much of a runaway winner.  Except for that bit about player elimination.  And how good stats get you more good stats.  So, never mind.

as a game for adults: 3/10
as a game for young kids: 1/10
as a game for just the right age of kids: 6/10

RATING: 7
I just can't rate this game any higher than a 6.  Ironically, it has everything I like in a game -- fantasy theme, variable starting abilities for players, high replay level because of the number of cards and expansions, room for strategy despite the high random factor, etc.  I really don't know why I don't like it better.  Maybe it's just played out.  We used to play this a LOT in the 1980's -- it's one of the most played games I own, though I'm sure I haven't touched it in 10 years. 
UPDATE:  Okay, 6 was unfair and was based on over-playing it 20 years ago.  Having played recently, I'm raising it to 7.  The game is fun and has grand fantasy story elements, even though the mechanics are a little thin.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Talisman is a classic pseudo rpg, but after having played modern boardgames, the 2nd edition of this game is just way too boring and time consuming. I can't even give it nostalgia-points, 'cause I got it only a few years ago. Still I could play it with children (if they are willing).

RATING: 5
Simple roll and move rules.  Draw a card and do what it says.  Not much of a game here and very little strategy.  Plus, you are fighting an extreme uphill battle as the boss is overpowered and death is common.  Seems to based more on luck than anything else.  Still, I have fun playing it every once in a while.

RATING: 9
Ah, the fond memories of staying up too late in college and playing this one with large groups.  Great fun--if you don't have time for a D&D campaign or to explain Magic Realm to someone, this is a light "middle ground".  Tons of additions make the game large enough to be fairly navigable and satisfying.  A lot of people don't like this, and it probably isn't the greatest game ever produced, but I'm quite fond of it.  If you like this, check out Runebound as well.  It's too bad Games Workshop changed into Minis Workshop because these are too expensive to buy now.  2nd edition is the best edition to get.

RATING: 7
This was my first 'real' board game - i.e. beyond Cluedo and the Game of Life. I played it a lot with my brother and our mum, and then in later years when they were both busy with other things I played it by myself. 

A lot of people hate Talisman. It's true that's very dependent on chance, but that's missing the point. The point is roaming around this world, having scraps and finding magical treasures! A lot of what I love about Talisman comes from the 2nd edition art. Gary Chalk is one of the world's best and most distinctive fantasy illustrators, and 2nd ed Talisman has an atmosphere all of its own, which hints at all the strangeness and magic just beyond the borders of your immediate adventure. 

It's a flawed game, for sure, but one of the best of its type, and bolstered a bit by nostalgia and sterling artwork.

I've played this so many time while growing up. Bought from new as a Christmas present.

Though not as monotonous as many seem think, it's not a thrill a minute either. There are many games of this genre that are more fun and take less time (e.g. Mystic Wood). If you want light fantasy fun, try Dungeonquest instead. It takes less time, and is always more fun.

Talisman was another gateway for us. We've played a looooooot of Talisman. The strength, craft, life and gold tokens on our 2nd edtn. set are very worn. Says it all, really.

RATING: 8
Classic game, good family fun. Best with first two expansions, less a couple of over-powered cards and characters. Crazy prices on ebay may eventually go down as the FFG copy establishes itself as THE edition. Think I gave my copy away when I thought I'd grown out of it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I like it a lot. Some people think it's simplistic and takes forever, but it is just a simple and good conversion of old-school roleplaying games. Run around, kill monsters and gain experience and gold. If possible use expansions (best: City, Timescape, Dragons).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Loved this game as a kid.  So many hours immersed in this world.  Its a bit unbalanced with certain characters, but we solved that by not allowing people to play those characters.  Also getting to the Crown of Command first pretty much means that you win.  But just playing is a great time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is the second edition, with most of the expansions.  It makes the game a bit crazy pulling them all out at once, and the characters aren't exactly balanced or anything, but it is a classic from my childhood and I like it.  The length can be detrimental, but not too much.

I can understand why people would love this if they spent a great deal of time playing when they were young, but I had the misfortune of playing as an adult. Few times in my gaming life have I so wanted a game to be over. Awful, horrible, crappy game. And there was enough interest for someone to reprint it in 2007!

RATING: 6
Do you like rad 80's fantasy art? Do you like different roles? Do you like crushing your enemies? Then play Talisman. Do you want to keep your friends? Then don't play Talisman. It's like Monopoly for the Ameritrash crowd.

RATING: 4
Plays like Munchkin. Not a terribly good game. Very adversarial, grindy, lots of fiddly rules and alot of cheap "take that" action from both players and even the board. Really shows its age as a game about one player forcing others to quit! Still it was kind of fun, I could see it being entertaining with ~4 players and some beer

Much fun was had growing up with Talisman, and there still is some fun to be had.  Well, a little.  Biggest drawbacks imho tendency for long drawn out games of nuclear escalation as players get more and more powerful and it's painfully obvious who is going to win in the end anyway.  And of course the massive luck factor.

Still, chanting "Toad! Toad! Toad!" as someone takes a roll at the City is priceless.  A decent gateway game at the time to get people from RPG's to boardgames though.

Nice looking miniatures to be had, but the expansions started making it all too much for me.

RATING: 8
I give this an 8 because it was my favorite game as a pre-teen and teenager.  Used to play this with my friend Dana a few times a year, and we both loved it.  It didn't bother us at all that the game was luck-driven or kind of silly.  We just loved the feel of adventuring and making the big decision to jump into the final realm. I doubt that I would play this now, but I hope to introduce it to my daughter someday.  I'm pleased that there's a new edition out, with plans for expansions.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Great game for people who like the roll and receive random card brigade. The fantasy aspect puts adventure roleplaying onto a board. There are strategic options, further added to by the expansions (I have 3rd ed with the City/Forest and Dragon's Tower), which make the game not totally linear. And there is the ability to attack other players which makes the game change depending on the personalities at the table. All in all it is rather luck dependent and should be viewed as light fun with a great theme and components (as you'd expect from GW and the price).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Theme is great and I like the cards that stay on the board. Gameplay is just rolling the die for a couple of hours and that's it.

Children and role players tend to enjoy it.  In reality it is nothing but a random dice game wrapped around a fantasy setting.  Would be ok if it didn&#039;t take so damn long.  Game also has nothing resembling balanced play.

RATING: 7
Talisman (2nd Ed.) -- If you care about winning, this may not be for you.  If you want to have a blast casually enjoying the play itself, Talisman is great.  I got this and each expansion when they came out, but it took more space than I could afford, so I got rid of the boxes (!) and combined all expansions in one generic cardboard box.  This was before it became one of the Gamers' Grails, but it doesn't matter, since I'm never going to sell this.  Very fond memories.

Back in the day, we bought all the expansions and had to have four tables in play to contain it all. These days it's the main board and maybe the Dungeon (if my son asks for it). I know it's unloved here on BGG, but it's still goofy fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a good game if you miss those Dungeons & Dragons sessions, but don't have time for heavy role-playing or have children so all-night gameplaying is out of the question. I found I had to keep my nose in the rulebook all the time to figure things out. That bogged down game playing. This might fix itself if I played it more often. It's definitely aimed at older players.

I don't care if its unbalanced. I don't care if gameplay is based on die rolls either. With a few home-brew rules to fix said disbalancing, this is still a classic game that is a blast with 3 or more players. Especially fun (and long) when played with all the expansions, I still think GW had (note the past tense) a knack for making fun, colorful boardgames that didn't require a ton of thought (or a ton of painting) to provide an evening of fun.

RPGers are the obvious audience for the D&D theme and flavor, but...

I love the fantasy theme but this just isn't a good game IMO. It lasts a very long time, there's no real decision making during the game, the characters are unbalanced, it's totally random. I guess it's just obsolete as it's quite old. I'll give it a 3 but only because I like the theme.

Played it so much as a kid. Not the deepest game ever made and very dependent on luck but I always thought the artwork was beautiful and it had a lot of charm. With the expansions there were plenty of character options, all with unique abilities, which provided the game with a lot of replay value (although some were far superior to others - I mean, how tough was the monk?). If you don't mind playing a game solely centred around random encounters set in a fantasy world, you'll probably enjoy this.

Was a fun game for my late teens and early 20's for the time I played it, but ultimately many rule arguments and the frustration of the dice in relation to the exact movement points I needed to hit a certain important space of the moment soured me to it.   I'll still play it if there are large gaps of time, in months,  in between sessions.  This, of course, includes the expansions.

I recently aquired and played this game again after some twenty years and it has not aged well at all. A real tedious luck fest.

I have both the 1983 addition and the new addition GW put out.  In the new edition there is only one female.  The wonderful thind about the 1983 edition was that it was full of female characters.

I loved this game, and so did my sister, which was good.  As kids, the variable characters made us feel like we had a secret edge that the other person just didn't understand.  Simple strategy and lots of fun, though the quest for the mule card was always a pain.

RATING: 8
One of my favorite games of all time, Talisman is inherently a simple game but is very fun to play.  The adventure cards representing monsters, places, and events add a twist so that no two games are exactly alike.  The primary flaws of the game are that once all the expansion sets are added (such as the Expansion Set, Adventure, Dungeon, Timescape, City, and Dragons) games can take hours, perhaps even days to complete because there are so many ways to try to win.  Another small flaw with Talisman is that some of the characters are incredibly unbalanced (the Prophetess and Astropath, to name two.)

At the time of its release, it was a great game. Now I would probably never play again (it's actually not much more than a fantasy Monopoly with some extra stuff), still it deserves a good rating because of what it means to many people (including myself).

Truth is, I used to love this game for some reason. Maybe because it required such a investment of time that made it "feel" epic.

I have very fond memories of playing this game with my younger brother.  Once we started playing it, we could not get enough and eventually picked up all the expansions.

This is a great fantasy lite-RPG game, perfect for keeping teens interested in the hobby.  I doubt I would play this with older folks, but once my kids get older, this would be a fun romp.

This game was tops when it first came out.  There was nothing better for this type of board game.  Still have my copy from like 1984 and every expansion.  My two sons LOVE this game (8 and 10) and my daughter (7) really enjoys it too.

Perfect to introduce a medium complex board game to kids.  Simple enough for them to play and fun enough for adults to re-play with them!

For the audience this game is intended for and the time it came out, i rate it a 10.

A bit problematic, that the game can often take half a day or more to play, especially if everyone is trying to garner more and more power before going to the inner rings, where it's much harder to gain strength, and much easier to lose it. This happens a lot more when the players are young.

I did however play in a game that ended too quickly, once.

Used to play this a lot. It passed the time, but goodness knows you had meager enough influence over whether you lived or died. You just play to see what happens. That sort of thing can work, but it generally needs some sort of dramatic structure to do so. With no force actually driving the game towards a discernable conclusion, this doesn't have it.

6 hours and we didn't even finish! Roll and move! Massive player down-time! Take That! Lost Turns! Did I have fun? Surprisingly, yes. Go in with the right attitude of spending time with some friends, rolling dice , and pushing my luck like crazy, and this can be a reasonably fun game. Would I choose it? No. Would I play it again? I'd like to check out the new edition for comparison sake, but I probably don't see myself agreeing to spend 4-8 hrs this way very often. It's fun, but it's a pretty low fun/time commitment ratio.

One of my all time faves.  Sure there is plenty of luck to this game but all of my friends still enjoy it.  I'm not sure why many people here say it takes forever to play.  One guy, here on BGG, even said that his first game lasted 24 hours!  I think the longest game we've played lasted 4 hours.

Another game I wish I had held on to. It was loads of fun, and I enjoyed the connection to the Warhammer Fantasy universe as an added bonus. I also owned a couple of the expansions (The Dungeon and one other I can't recall) and felt that some of the new characters/cards which accompanied the expansions actually hurt the game and made it uneccessarily convoluted. 

I look forward to trying the FF 4th edition, which I have heard good things about.

Almost thirty years ago this was a regular, through a haze of smoke. I can't remember whether we actually ever finished a game or if we just quit after a few hours.
Now [i](2007 when I wrote this)[/i], after all those years, with other friends, Talisman (2nd) came up again and after initial enthusiasm it appeared to be as dreadsome as I feared it would be. Sure, it has its fun parts, but after all the one who gets luckiest in drawing cards and rolling dice will win.
...unless nasty spells are cast against that player...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Talisman is a guilty pleasure in these modern days of finely-tuned German-style games.  However, Talisman has great theme, good replayability, good adventuring fun-factor, and supreme expandability. Needs a few house rules and tweaks to make it purr, but ultimately it is an inspired design and one that remains popular over the years, a cult-classic.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
At first I fell in love with this board game because it was unique to me. However, after having played it many times over now, I feel it suffers from many of the same issues other Games Workshop games have... ambiguous rules and constant exceptions. I suppose another reason I'm a little sore about it was the price I had to pay to get the 2nd edition (3rd sold out at the local game shop and none were available even on Ebay). For first timers, I recommend that you plan for a long evening because this one can cause a little grief at the outset. If you are lucky enough to sit in with seasoned veterans of the game, you will likely get to see a better side of the game than I did.

 Talisman will always be a favorite of mine.  It falls under the genre of &quot;Roll, Move, then react from where you land&quot; type of game.  The artwork and look of the game is amazing.  Again, more luck than strategy, but I could not help but give this game a 10 because of all the creativity I have put into my own characters.  And with all the expansions and cool Adventure cards , man o man, I could go on and on about the creativity involved in this game!

Yeeeeeaaaah, it's not so hot.  Like [gameid=34119], this game is all about the story and features only minimal decistions.  As far as 1980s fantasy goes, it hits all the major points, such as lots of pastel, lizardmen, gold, hit points, etc.  For your D&D group when there's no campaign prepared, this could be ideal.  It's a wonderful tool to facilitate storytelling.  The problem is that it's just way too long.  The novelty wears after about an hour, and it's just too long and slow after that.  Waiting for somebody to get to the center takes too long, and even that's not enough... they have to kill everybody off first.  To make matters worse, it's hopelessly random, and some skills, characters, and items are hopelessly overpowered.  Others are terribly weak.  Try it once, but don't bother buying it.

RATING: 6
This was my go-to game during the 1980s / early 90s.  I absolutely adored this game (at the time).  I must have written Games Workshop about a half-dozen times for rules clarifications (this was back before the internet).  I currently own the complete 2nd edition (base game + expansions).

At the end of the day, Talisman is a wildly chaotic dice-fest with heroes, treasure and monsters.  In one game your character will be like a god, in the next game you're little better than a target dummy.  Some expansions are awesome, others are dubious at best.  Some games last an hour, others last 6+ hours (depends on house rules, characters in play, etc).

I still consider this game an awesome pick for nerdy grade school / high-school gamers who have a penchant for swords, dragons, elves, etc.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Very early adventure game that is a conceptual forerunner of Runebound, Descent etc. (Published after Magic Realm so I think I would look to the latter as forerunner of hex-based games like Mage-Knight). It surprises me that there isn't more commentary on Talisman's rather nasty win condition.

RATING: 3
It was passably fun when it was originally published, but it hasn't aged well.  The theme comes through nicely, but with an RPG theme you'd think more players would make it more fun, but it simply increases downtime.  The biggest flaw of the game is the time it takes to complete this dice fest.

yes it has a roll and move mechanic, yes it takes hours to play, yes its very basic but still ifn played only occasionally it can be fun, potential to be a gateway game (although even newbies may spot this is pretty random)

Fun fantasy romp with lots of characters to choose from and great theme.  A classic worth having regardless of which version you have but I think 2nd edition is the best with all its expasnions.

RATING: 4
This rating is with all the expansions.  A game that hasn't aged well.  Roll and move, with lots of additional randomness via cards + a LONG playtime.  Not a combination of stuff that impresses me very much.  My GF kicked my tail last time I played this, which made me happy, as the game ended.

The greatest (next to "Labirynt Śmierci") part of my childhood adventure with boardgames. I can still remember these sessions spread out for 2, 3 evenings. In these times it was for sure 10/10. I played it earlier somewhere probably and I bother my parents to buy it for me. And they did it...
I can't remember who borrowed game from me.

This game was an obsession for me when I was in high school.
I bought every expansion set I could, and had an entire set of 
painted Talisman figurines. And when I tired of playing
the expansion set, I made my own deck of adventures, charcters and expansion boards. And when I tired of that I remade the entire game with all new rules and free form board. The mechanics of the game are nothing special
but the theme was great.

When this came out I thought I had found the Holy Grail. A game that would let me wander around a fantasy setting putting the smack down on nasty monsters and taking their stuff...with no Dungeon Master. It filled the void for a while. Nowadays it seems a bit dated. It was fantastic in it's own time though. I've thought of getting the newer editions, but why? Compared to other adventure themed games that have come out since (Arkham Horror, Runebound) this comes up really short and I now find it a bit stale and boring.

A magical quest game where you try to recover an artifact that lets you become a god?  Awesome.  Of course, Talisman is loooooong, especially if you have all of the expansions (I do).  But it's more epic than any other game I've played.

RATING: 5
Complete with minis. Excellent condition.  Finnish edition also (although missing the Mercenary card so a replacement card would be much appreciated!).
 The game isn't really anything special, it's more of a collectable/nostalgia thing...

It is a rich land.  What other game lets you find a bag of gold laying in an open field?  Or hide your War horse in a concealed pocket?  My view of the game is colored by its many expansions.  It takes hours and hours to play, but I still love it.

I play this about once a year at our group's annual Talisman tournament.  If you haven't played this and you get the chance, play it.  Do not pass go, do not collect the Crown of Command.  And watch out for the last step... it's a doozie.

RATING: 5
A little too long and too random for what you get.

I long ago mixed in four of the expansions (City, Dungeon, Expansion, Adventure) with my base set, and that's the only way I've played it.

I also owned Talisman Dragons, but never had the urge to play it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
It's just a bit daft, really. The game is something of a joke in these parts. A relic of the past, I don't think anyone I know would bother playing it now, although it's sometimes brought out as a threat. Specifically, it is mechanically weak - a simple roll and move game which goes on and on with little chance of player decision affecting the outcome. Do I go left, or do I go right? After five hours, I don't care. It looks nice, but it doesn't deliver enough for the time you have to invest. The comment 'D&D meets Snakes and Ladders' summarises things nicely.

What else? Well, the characters are unbalanced, the expansions drag the game out even further and don't seem to have been playtested (who has enough time for that?), the endgame is tiresome, the fantasy theme is superficial, rather than immersive, and so on. I was interested to see what changes would be made to improve the game with the new edition (2007), but it transpired they were not enough to make the game playable.

RATING: 7.5
Despite the length of play and some odd rules now and then, this game comprises some of my most cherished game playing experiences. I once owned everything but the Dragon expansion, back in the 90's, but sadly, that set is gone. I have recently built a Tal-is-Poor set and trying to get my friends interested in playing.

I have two friends with most of the 2nd edition expansions. Now, I am in heaven. :)

Most of my fondness for Talisman is nostalgia.  It is long, and incredibly random.  (roll & move, draw a card, and anything significant is determined by the dice.) Which makes for a very light fun game where you can focus on social interaction.  It does take a long time, so it's best used as something to do while  hanging out with people. The theme is well presented, which invites people to get into a little role playing if the mood strikes.  Lastly it can be fun just trying to accomplish something despite the dice.  Sadly I don't play as much as when I was young & had more free time.  But given the right people & circumstances I won't hesitate to play this.

The grand-daddy of all "adventure game" boardgames. Tons of die rolling. Tons of luck with the zillions of decks of cards. Tons of wildly variable outcomes and randomly powerful effects. But still engaging and fun, if incredibly long by today's standards. The art brings me back to my childhood.

[b]NOSTALGIA QUEST[/b]

The original quest, roll and move, game. Players compete via items, spells and allies, to reach the centre of the board and then reign magical fire down upon the others. Takes a day to play - with all the other expansion boards.
Played this a ton of times when I was a teenager; my Dad used to like playing it too. Haven't played this for many years. Will revisit in the future, maybe.

After a house-move I blew the dust off of my Talisman box, removing the lid to disturb cards and components that had laid dormant for an age. I gained a great deal of pleasure purely from sorting the wisdom chits, etc, into new plastic ziplock bags, and banding up the copious number of cards. The boards were all in great condition, and I had forgotten just how many character profiles I had amassed from all the expansions: a boatload.

I can't say for sure when this will see my gaming table next, but I don't forsee a time when it will leave my collection. The energies of nostalgia are too strong in this one!

I own ALL the expansions, except for Dragons.

[i]UPDATE 2nd May 2012:[/i] This game just doesn't stand up to any *modern* game-design criteria, falling down so many design fissures I lost count. Clearly a game of its time, and its time was when I was 12.

I have trouble enjoying this game now, knowing that we all possess far, far superior titles which to play of an evening, makes me grind my tusks during the endless cycle of turns. This probably makes me read like a pretentious game twat 'too good for FUN games' - well, think that if ye like, but I prefer games that encourage decision making - Talisman asks no meaningful decisions of you. I'd rather play Yahtzee all night long, yo.

When my daughter can read, I [i]may[/i] be tempted to play this with her, but that's a pretty big may.

A good laugh.
I play with 2 basic sets combined, plus all expansions except 'timescape' (which is just naff). I often dont include the city board as it gives too much away cheaply.
When much younger we used to use a second board and had a 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail' themed deck....

This game is too random for my tastes. Yes, it's fun to turn your enemies into toads and murder them, but the Random spell is incredibly destructive, and the roles that always have a spell are much more powerful than their alternatives. It also felt like a game of "roll the dice, something happens". You have the power to choose which direction you walk in, but the loot cards and the large dice range combined to create a feeling of no control.

RATING: 9
Random roll-and-move fantasy board game. Easy to enter, fun to play, but not for the tactician. Lucky I'm not a tactitian.
Downgraded to an 8. I really love Talisman, but I can't say it's an amazing game. Rather, it's a kind of experience to have when you're just into rolling some dice and drawing some cards. I prefer to play with all expansions, to enhance the chaotic feel of doom.

Can get long winded if using expansions, but a great character building game.

I used to love playing this around 1985. It was my first gaming purchase, the B&W edition 1st Edition, and I still have fond memories of some of those games.

I acquired it many years later to play with the wife; It hit the table once and I never felt as immersed in the game.

I've had at least six copies of this game slip through my mitts throughout the years, but never seem to hang onto it for long.

I understand that this game holds a dear place in some people's hearts, but given the games we have on the market today, it (2nd edition) just doesn't hold up.  It's very simple roll and move with so much randomness that the game negates any decision making by the players.  I've played now 3 times in my life and I'm done with it as far as I'm concerned.

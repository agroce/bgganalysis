GAME: Untold: Adventures Await
RANK: 4559
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
The best game at UKGE 2017.

If you like the idea of storytelling games but don't want the hassle of things like D&D/Pathfinder, the this game might be right up your ally. It requires no prep time and no DM to sit out, as the players create the story using carefully constructed generic plot cards. Don't be fooled by the age rating. This game is easy to play and is accessible to kids and families, but is equally fun with all adult groups.

Infinitely repayable (and expandable) and accessible to all audiences, this game gets top marks from this reviewer.

A game that could be a fine introduction to both role playing and storytelling.  I have been around both genres a long time and found Untold a little too structured for my taste.  Nonetheless, three of us still managed to have some fun with this and I did like the emphasis on narrative rather than stats.

This isn't a game at all, but it is a very nice story-telling exercise, and a very well done one at that!

Most story-telling games I've played don't have anything to keep the story on the rails, or are competitive, so they end up incentivizing players to actively just run the story off the rails. Untold has mechanisms that bring players back to key story points, while also allowing for creative story-telling around those key points.

The game is also produced really wonderfully, with thick tiles with recessed areas to place the dice. Well beyond what I expected!

I've played with my three-year old, with me kind of GM-ing the story, and he contributed wonderfully, while gasping at several turns the story took. Definitely will be something we pull out as a fun family activity!

Brilliant, yet simple design. Brings out a fun, and surprising story every time.
It comes with the base set of Rory's Story Cubes. I also have Rory's Story Cubes Actions, Voyages, Fantasia, Animalia, and Medieval.

Very good, but I wish it helped the players more to define the relationships between the characters, the characters' motivations and their weaknesses, in order to make the characters more distinct - and the story more interesting - when going forwards.

I really like the idea of this game. When I played it though I felt that for me it could have been a little more control to force the game forwards. Now it felt like a giant discussion where ideas where thrown left and right, no one actually had the mandate to drive the story forward. I understand that you don't want to steer to much or cap the creativity, but if you want a semi-role-playing in 1 hour, you need to do something.

Note that there is no game element in Untold. You don't win or lose, you "only" have a good time.

Played it at Spiel17, a really good tool using Story Cubes. It gives you direction by creating an envorinment in  wich the storys take place. 

The look and feel of the game, pads and other atributes was great. Overall good quality. The signs and visuals were apealing and the game played easy. 

With these tools you Story Cubes will get a lot more use i recon.

Played great with 3 players can imagine more players would even be way better!

[b]tl;dr[/b] — A terrific "pick up and play" storytelling game in 60 minutes or less; near infinite replayability and the way it seamlessly folds in kids, adults, novices and experts [i]simultaneously[/i] make it an instant classic.

[microbadge=18065]

[b]After 5 plays:[/b]  It is an absolute marvel how well this works—allowing adults and children to play together on equal terms*—and how cleanly it engages people who aren't used to storytelling or role playing games.  This was the first RPG experience for the kindergartener and two of the adults—they took to it instantaneously and enthusiastically, so much so it's become a weekly event that everyone looks forward to.

[size=7]*Our playtest group consisted of two kids, ages six and 12, in addition to goofy grownups.[/size]

In the beginning I had the usual concern that playing with children would lead to a stunted and necessarily edited version of what the game could (or should) be; instead I found it to be a delight, filled with surpise and wonder.

[b]After 7 plays:[/b]  Two sessions with veteran RPGers have proven this thing to be completely off the hook.**  Far less fussy than most Indie RPGs, it'll have a permanent place in the bag for when we don't have a quorum on RPG night.  The rest of the time it'll live front and center in the main play space for whenever the mood strikes, well, [i]anyone[/i]—because this is literally a game for everyone!

The first time that I sat down to play this, I was unsure whether it would really work, and sceptical about whether it was my sort of thing. Within about 5 minutes of playing, I was blown away by it: strictly speaking, it is more of a storytelling mechanism than a game but it does what it sets out to do better than any storytelling system I have ever encountered. Can't wait to play it again and to share it with friends.

This might be a preemptive rating, but I guess I can go back and adjust it in the future. This game is exactly what I expected and even more. I sat down and played a completely creative story telling game with my middle school age sister in law with minimal set up and just straight laughs and engagement. This is what Rory's Story Cubes needed, and what story telling games needed. She has already begun discussing future ideas and potential characters and plot points.

The absolute coolest part of the experience was her idea that someone could and should (and maybe we will at the end of the adventure) write an entire book about the story we told. As a future educator, this is the type of creative engaging game that I hope to be able to bring to students to illustrate how fun learning can be when viewed in the right perspective.

This is not a game for everyone, there are no tough choices or brain burning puzzles, but I would be discrediting the beauty and design of this game if I didn't rate it a ten.

This is a perfect example of a storytelling game. The first real step towards the long overdue concept of a RPG/BG hybrid.
Plays fast and feels like a tv show episode, great with 2+ players, creativity and improvisation are king. The campaign system leaves you wanting for more.

A perfect combination of structure and inspiration. I've had three great "episodes" with the game - two in a modern spooky old town with a Scooby Doo vibe and another Pulp Adventure in 1930's Greece. It's pure story telling, and that may simply not be for everyone, but it's so easy to jump right in to with no prep and very few rules. I will be coming back to this over and over and over. It's already a hit with my kids, and I hope my adult gamer friends will be willing to give it a try.

Simple yet very innovative,  the experience of playing this game is fresh and encourages the imagination to flourish, as well as it teaches players how to listen and incorporate other's ideas to collaboratively create stories that are exciting and unexpected. A must have for absolute newcomers and long time board game enthusiasts, and those in-between, it's really a game that everyone could enjoy.

My wife has always struggled to get into Roleplaying/Storytelling games, but with Untold: Adventures Await we had an absolute blast. The rules are simple and easy to understand but the possibilities are endless.

The board essentially takes the role of a DM in a traditional Roleplaying game. It has just the right amount of guidance to help you craft a story and world that is fun to explore and play. After our first session my wife and I had a memorable story to tell and were eager to see what would happen in the next session. 

This is a true gem of a game.

First Impressions: I like storytelling based roleplaying games, and this feels kind of like that. Using the Story Cubes and special icons to give context to allocated dice seems like a good more. Might be interesting to take a look at, if you are looking for an RPG that relies more on the story then on stats. But this feels like like an introduction into such a style of RPG. If you already are using a system that favors storytelling, such as Fate for example, then this quickly falls into the shadows.

RATING: 6
Great idea for a game, but it felt a bit like a rather aimless discussion, and being forced to perform a set number of action, or ask a set number of questions. The game is a wonderful concept, and using a system inspired by the Apocalypse Engine also helps, but it may not be for me. I would greatly enjoy playing it again with a choice set of Rory's Story Cubes, such as the Doctor Who set, or Looney Tunes.

Ein sehr freies Rollenspiel mit Hilfestellung durch die beliebten Story Cubes. Ich mag das Konzept mit den Würfeln, die den Verlauf der Geschichte vorgeben, aber frei interpretiert werden können. Allerdings ist mir das Ganze fast schon eine Spur zu frei... ich mag es lieber, wenn ich ein richtiges Ziel habe. Ein richtiges Spiel ist Untold halt nicht wirklich, sondern eher ein Baukasten um sich gemeinsam Geschichten auszudenken. Dafür ist er aber sehr gelungen.

GAME: Treasure Hunter
RANK: 1210

RATING: 3
[I]tl;dr - Bland, forgettable games should not get good ratings -- they should be abandoned. Treasure Hunter is one of those.[/I]
[COLOR=#CCCCFF]____________________________[/COLOR]

"Good game" pays this one a compliment. It's fine, it's inoffensive, the mechanics are even a little interesting, but that just doesn't cut it in today's world. Especially for a light/filler game, the theme needs to be [i]gripping[/i] or it needs to be drop-dead simple to explain. Treasure Hunter does neither, and the result is a bland, forgettable lightweight game. This one is totally superseded by Sushi Go and 7 Wonders -- seriously, don't waste your time. 

If you're determined to buy it though (maybe you saw Amazon's sweet deals on Queen Games), here are a few positive points. The min/max interaction is interesting and makes every round different -- though since the treasure distribution is totally random, each round will be different. Also, the dog/goblin interaction is fairly interesting, making you decide each round if you'll pay for dogs, or if you'll just bite the bullet and get robbed by the goblins (and help another player who [i]did[/i] invest in protection). Even then, it's far too easy for everyone to 'cover' themselves from round to round, and leave someone who invested in dogs with little to no coin reward for doing so.

I would have appreciated some sort of intention with the scroll distribution (maybe the treasures are always only maxes, while the special abilities require you to go for min) causing you to make a strategy decision throughout the game. I'd also love some sort of treasure tiles that function as red/green/blue/dog cards, allowing you to build up a semi-permanent tableau in front of you that could always be optionally used, but are worth no points at the end of the game. 

Again, the game is fairly interesting, but that is just not enough, and this one is getting the axe from me.

1st play: Richard Garfield is the man. I am not a big drafting game fan 
but this one is pretty good. Drafting along 3 colors and trying to get highest or lowest is cool, and the watchdogs give you a 4th set to go for "most" in. Different powers change up paths and turns are very fast. Very pure drafting game, easier to explain than 7 wonders, and thematically more interesting. Good art too.

No Second play.

RATING: 6
A card drafter in which your are drafting cards for four different purposes and - for three of those - deciding whether it is the min or max reward you are after.  Plays quickly and offers some fun at the expense of others' misfortune.  There is a fair degree of randomness, with the final card of each hand reminding you why 7 Wonders (a better drafting game) threw that card away.  Action cards that allow a desperate player to draw from the deck add further randomness.  

Production quality and artwork are both decent.  The iconography is easily understood.

Ebben a játékban sokkal több van, mint elsőre gondolná az ember. Ugyanakkor azt gondolom, hogy hosszú távon önismétlő. Mindenesetre nagyon hangulatos, ötletes, és ami a legfontosabb - ugyanolyan jól játszató kettő és akár hat emberrel is!

Fun drafting and then bidding off for these treasure tiles in the various zones, and then the Action Cards add in a lot more subtlety and strategy. Plus, who doesn't love the Goblin phase in this game? The lazy adventurers leave their dogs behind to take care of the pesky intruders!

Fun, fun, fun, another score for Richard Garfield.

RATING: 9
A fast and fun card drafting game and, judging from the ratings here, an underrated gem. At first, it may look bland and the rules are nothing special, but the game develops a very nice flow with good interaction and just the right amount of luck for its type. 

The illustrations are refreshing as well, my only gripe are the token and card backgrounds: they are not as detailed as the rest. Still highly recommended.

Könnyed, gyerekekkel is játszható, nekem mondjuk az Augustussal egy szint, annál kicsit izgalmasabb azért. Rendesen káoszos, látszik, hogy a Roborally szerzője jegyzi:) Szerintem az nagy ötlet, hogy a min és a max kap valamit, a többiek nem. Az akciókártyák megkavarják, változatossá és rendesen kiszámíthatatlanná teszik. Partijátékhoz közelít. Nem rossz, de annyira nem is nagy durranás.

RATING: 6
Card drafting of the quite simple kind. Interesting choices to make in order to draft though, which puts this game apart from others. Not really quick as game, which is my only complaint really, since -for the depth of this game- a filler duration would be more appropriate than a normal-length one (~1h).

Ook heb je geen flauw idee hoe ver de anderen staan qua punten, tot op het einde, en dat vind ik een slechte eigenschap van een spel.

Initial Impressions:
----------------------
A card drafting game with some interesting aspects to it.  I do think the high / low aspect is neat, but there does seem to be an issue that someone can run away with the game pretty easily.  I like card drafting games, and thought this one was fine for what it is, but I don't see this being played much by anyone in a year or two.  Just too many better card drafting games.

Volt szerencsém játszani egy demó példánnyal és kifejezetten elégedett vagyok a játékkal. Egy könnyed szórakozás a szó szoros értelmében, mert kezdő játékosoknál is bevethető. Kifejezetten jó pont, amit érzek ebben a játékban, hogy tovább billentheti a kezdő játékost a komolyabb játékok irányában. Pörgős játék és jóformán vicces is, ahogy az utolsó két körben összedőlnek a terveink, mivel a mellettünk lévő játékos olyan lapot ad, amiből már nem nagyon tudunk választani. Nem ajánlok azoknak, akik szeretik teljesen precízen felépíteni a taktikájukat és kifejezetten idegesítik, hogy nem csak rajtuk múlik a nyerés, de úgy érzem bőven benne van a játékban a stratégia lehetőség. Kötelező darab a családi társasjátékok terén.

Nice game. The whole family can get behind this one. A healthy array of things to consider each round. 

Casual. We all enjoy it. Even though we often (not always) count points at the end, most of the time, no one cares who won. A family game. 

The cards are bit weak (especially for a drafting game where is constant shuffling, trading, etc.) I think the 2-player variant works just fine if you don't come to the game expecting a 'serious' and competitive drafting experience.

RATING: 8
This is pretty fun, and there is actually more scope for clever play in the drafting phase than you might think. Some elements don't work too well (the doubling cards are annoying and the Mystery Mule is basically worthless). The back-and-forth of special card play is not quite as robust as it should be (I think it would've been better to have slightly fewer color-specific cards and more/different yellow specials). Nevertheless, it's a fun diversion I would gladly play.

Drafting game where you dont reveal the card the moment you drafted it, but rather reveal them at the end of a round. There is a certain order in which the cards are revealed and each step requires you to show all the cards you have of that type (and modify it with bonuses etc). It's not too heavy, but there was a suprising amount of choice in how to use your cards.

My 12 yo got very excited for this game once I explained it was a card drafting game from the guy who created Magic.  He was only slightly put off when he found out we couldn't directly attack each other, or steal from each other.  They still enjoyed it though, and I can see this getting 2 or 3 plays per month from them.

Nothing wrong with this game, but not much to draw me in either. I pick cards, aiming either high or low, and hope to win depending on what the other players have that I don't know about. You do have to remember what has passed a bit in order to go for something being ignored or prepare for a card that you're going to get stuck with.

A grossly underrated game. It is a great, accessible, filler with a unique mechanic and excellent replay value. Try to score high? Or try and score low. Bluff your opponent? Or play an action card? The game shines at 3 players but is great for 2 with the modified rules. My 6 year old is a bit advanced for his age but plays the game very competitvey and requests it often.

An interesting take on "card drafting" and WHY you are choosing or not choosing to take or forgo certain cards.  I also like the player interaction, which is better than other games that rely on card/resource drafting.

There is more strategy required to play this game than one might think.

Thanks to publisher I had opportunity to take the prototype with me on my summer holidays. We played it everynight - It was the only 6 players game with decent complexity, interesting decisions and short (1h) gameplay. Even if one of us didnt love the game it was still fun enough to play. Replayability seems to be high.

Medium to light strategy. Cool graphics. Fast passed.  Card drafting.  Quick to learn.  I would put this in the top half of new games that I have played for the first time in 2016.  I got stomped, so I need to try out a few other strategies. 

One downside--the physical game has lots of parts and the box in which it comes has, typical to Queen Games, only two compartments.  Either it will get really sloppy in there or you will have baggies full of parts.  No reason to skip owning the game, just a downside.

Card Drafting
Treasures are placed on the game board first. Then all players are given a hand of nine cards from which to draft, drawing one card and passing to the left or the right depending on which round is being played. At the end of drafting, all players will have a hand of nine cards and a little knowledge of what the other players may have in their hands as well. All players must play any and all cards from their drafted hand of nine for each season they have cards for, whether they want one of the two treasures or not.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Rated after 1 play @ 3

Treasure Hunter is a simple card drafting game where you're trying to assemble a hand of cards that will either be the min value or max value among all the players. You can collect additional base cards as well as some modifier cards that boost values after the fact. The goal is to collect the most valuable treasure throughout the game.

Game play is quick and the rules are light enough to explain in 10-15 minutes. Where the game falls short is the amount of decision making that exists. Players are only drafting from a small subset of cards in the deck and it's possible that there will be no cards of a particular color left. Modifier cards can only affect your cards, a bit of a disappointment coming from Richard Garfield. 

Finally there are the dog cards. Basically you need to collect them to chase away goblins that steal money from you. Totally unnecessary to the base mechanic of the game. It feels like this mechanic was pasted on after the base game became too light.

In all, I'd play it at a game night if the group I was with wanted a light, 45 minute game to end the night with. It's too light for my personal tastes and seems like it will get old after 10+ plays.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Was hoping for a bit more from this game. I was initially intrigued by the min/max acquisition of treasures and there's overall a decent amount of variability in tactics. But it still felt like choices were a little too limited. I've tried it as a two-player and three-player and the three-player was much better but the wide point spreads still made it feel a little too chaotic. It is worth noting that my wife, on the other hand, preferred the 2-player more with its hidden cards and greater chance of splitting the treasure.

The kickstarter exclusives added a pleasant extra dimension to this but still not enough for this to enter into heavy rotation. Just a bit too simplistic.

A great game for new and experienced gamers alike. The drafting mechanic allows for everyone to feel as though they took part in the play - everyone gets to do things every turn and for most of each turn. The lighthearted atmosphere of the game is a good complement to the accessible rules and rewarding gameplay. The game board in particular looks great and the idea for it to flip into the scoreboard was great.

Why this is not a 10:
-> Some iconography and specific card rules aren't intuitively clear.
-> The high-variance nature of the game leads to some rounds feeling much better than others. You may find a lackluster mix of treasures on one play and a dynamic collection on the next.

Not really my kind of game, but very good family title.
Not for heavy or even semi-heavy gamers, but could be short sacrifice for fun with non-gamers.

Because of a draft as main mechanic, can be described as a family version of Seven Wonders.
Accepting 6 players and nice arts are also good for this kind of game.

RATING: 6.5
Treasure Hunter is a neat card drafting game.  It is like a simple version of 7 Wonders.  I like it.  There are many who feel 7 Wonders is a Gateway family game.  Not my family, who struggled a lot with it and never wanted to see it again.  I can see Treasure Hunter working with them.

The cards are basically in 5 sets: four colours and some dogs.  The cards go around and around and when done you see who has the most and least in each colour.  There is a bonus (sometimes bad, mostly good) for each result.  The dogs are slightly different but broadly similar.   Add a little more complexity (bonuses for sets collected in the game and such like) and that is about it.

The downsides?  It is essentially a small card game (around 80 cards) in a ridiculously large Queen box (yes there is a board, but it isn’t a board that is essential for the game play).  If it were packaged more appropriately I would purchase it, but I can’t afford to give up that much shelf space for a game of such little mass.  

Also be warned: the expansion which is out now is a lot of money and contains very little for that money.  Avoid the expansion.

But that aside I recommend Treasure Hunter as a fine family card drafting game. It is easy to teach, easy to play, and a recommended relaxing family game which introduces card drafting in a far easier and more intuitive way than 7 Wonders.

RATING: 6
Pretty standard card drafting game where you draft cards to help you go on adventures (have highest or lowest value) and guard your loot from gobbling. Some more strategy here than sushi go but sushi go takes 15 minutes whereas this game lasts up to an hour.

It's a simple game, good for young families, but our first game lasted way too long for what it is.

I'd play again if others wanted to, but I can't see myself asking for it. Good game, just is missing that something special.

Treasure Hunter has just enough point engines for players to ping pong between. Contest for one of the three high-low locations, try to capture the goblins, or go for straight points with coins. This surface provides a decent breadth of choice and makes Treasure Hunter a worthy filler, but it still is rather shallow overall.

Jó kis, egyszerű draftolós játék. Ezzel a draft mechanizmussal nem lehet mellényúlni, mert gyors, egyszerű és nagyon jól egyensúlyozza önmagát. Azért van benne jókora adag szerencse. Nincs is jobb annál, mint mikor egy ötlapos 21 pontos szettedet kiütik két lappal 22 ponttal és ezzel nullázol egy teljes fordulót az ötből. De olyan rövid és egyszerű a játék, hogy ez bőven belefér, lehet gyorsan tolni még egyet. 
A magyar kiadás botrányos az angol kártyákkal. Szégyen.

Treasure Hunter is sort of 7 Wonders light while playing in about the same time. Strategically, 7 Wonders is a monster compared to this where each round is an almost complete reboot and you are forced to play even cards that you don't want to.

Treasure Hunter is a perfectly serviceable game but with nothing to distinguish itself from the competition it's hard to find a reason for its existence.

Very enjoyable drafting game. The closest comparison that I've played is Medieval Academy, and I think I like this one just a touch better, although not a full point better on the rating scale. It's just a little easier and more straightforward to figure out what's going on in the different areas. Fun, and enough going on that it keeps its interest.

Treasure vadász vagy Kincs hunter avagy Hunglish kiadás
A játék elérhető magyar nyelven is, ami annyit tesz, hogy a pár oldalas, jól felépített, könnyen tanulható szabályát lefordították. Sajnos a tendencia már nem terjedt ki a kártyalapok magyarítására. Valószínűleg a sietség oltárán elvérzett ez a project, hogy karácsonyig a boltokba kerülhessen. Így felemás az ember érzése, mikor játszik vele. Társasjáték kedvelőként és rendszeres vásárlóként lassan „félelemmel” tölt el egy-egy társas magyar kiadása (csak egy részét fordítják le, hibás lapok, félrefordított szabályok, természetesen nincs csere, újranyomás) és inkább marad az eredeti kiadás rajongói szabályfordítással.
Maga a játék azonban jó, illetve nekem tetszik. 2-6 játékos (ajánlott a 4-5 fő) küzd meg kincsekért, varázstekercsekért megpróbálva elkerülni a „bóvlik” megszerzését, valamint a tolvaj kis goblinkákat.
Nagyon tetszett benne a 7 Csodából már megismert pakli kialakítás a játék elején. Majd a játék során először kalandozóinkat küldjük el, ahol a legnagyobb és legkisebb „erőt” felvonultató játékos szerzi meg a kincset. Majd kutyáink segítségével mindent megteszünk, hogy a goblinok ne foszthassanak ki minket és még a megszerzett érmelapjainkat is felhasználhatjuk. Utána ki-ki kénye-kedvére fel tudja használni sárga varázstekercseit még több pontot szerezve. Mindezt öt fordulón keresztül.
A pakli kialakítás mellett fontos szerepet játszik az akciókártyák használata, amikor egy-egy rossz helyzetet meg tud fordítani a cseles kalandozó csapat (az akciókártyákat csak saját csapatodra játszhatod ki).
Mindenképpen 4-5 játékossal ajánlom kipróbálását, főleg azoknak aki szeretik a gyorsan megtanulható, magasabb szerencsefaktorú játékokat, ahol a terveidet az utolsó kapott lapod a pakliépítés során teljesen keresztülvághatja.
2016.08.21. Két játékos verzió is kipróbálva. Meglehetősen jól működik, sőt itt már sokkal több lehetőséged van a taktikázásra is.

A draft ellenére durva a véletlen, könnyen lehet siker, de bukás is. Erőst kaotikus.
Ráadásul a fordulók erőst függetlenek, a lemaradónak semmi kompenzáció nincs (ez igen meglepő 2015-ben).
Magyarítás hiány.

RATING: N/A
Opinió després de una lectura de regles: filler de cartes on el jugador amb més "punts de tresor" al final de les 5 rondes guanya la partida. Cada ronda es juguen 3 estacions on es fa un draft a l'inici (les cartes serveixen per les 3 estacions). Per cada estació hi han unes cartes amb un valor, qui tingui el màxim i el mínim valor en total per cada estació s'endu unes losetes de tresor (poden tindre punts positius, negatius o accions especials). Al final de cada ronda hi ha una fase especial on s'han de jugar unes altres cartes o perdre punts.

Molt senzill, és un filler sobreproduit. Em recorda al Biblios o al Speicherstadt (sense la part de subasta).

Treasure Hunter is another drafting game in the vein of 7 Wonders of Vaccarino’s Greed. This is the main problem of Garfield’s creation. 7 Wonders is in another league, offering more gameplay in an only slightly longer game. But specifically in comparison with Greed, Treasure Hunter loses out. Greed is shorter than Treasure Hunter, nonetheless offers engine-building and deeper gameplay while in Treasure Hunter the five rounds are similar without any relevant development. Still fun but the existence of more rewarding alternatives makes Treasure Hunter superfluous.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I actually prefer this to 7 Wonders because it is more accessible in terms of the initial game visibility. 7 Wonders has no clear indication of how to play when the game first starts - this game has a clear set of goals and paths that may or may not be the most valuable in the given round. Additionally, I like how the game resets allowing for catchup rounds and it resets in a better way than Sushi Go
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Very underrated game! Although it has a high luck factor it's always a blast, especially with 6 players. It's an easy drafting game with a lot of tactical decision space. Everyone I played it with enjoyed it and wanted another round. Just the best gateway game beside Resistance and Coup.

I have enjoyed my plays of Treasure Hunter. It is easy to learn and teach and the component quality is nice. My kids have also enjoyed it. I hope that the expansions make the goblins a little more fearsome. They don't seem to have much of an effect, which is kind of a wasted part of the design.

I also wish that it was a little shorter. It has trended toward 45 minutes, which is simply too long for a game of this weight. 30 minutes tops.

I honestly hated this game. In many ways, it boils down to luck and being willing to screw over the people you're playing with. I felt like I was being ganged up on by my siblings, even though they insisted they were not colluding and that I was just "unlucky". Four out of six rounds? I'm not buying that, and it's not that I'm bad at playing games (I won the three games we played before this one: Food Chain Magnate, Automania, and Sheep and Thief). It reminded me of playing Risk as a pre-teen, and I will only play again if I can actually flip the table.

I didn't have much interest in this because I already have Medieval Academy as a light/family weight drafting game... after playing it I'm thinking about trading/selling Medieval Academy.

There are a lot of games where your trying to get the highest or lowest value to win something (Everything from Balloon Cup/Pinata to Smash Up! and then some.)  The difference here is that you go through drafting to establish what you have.  This actually works better than games like Sushi Go Party because you have some very clear goals.  At the same time the goals vary beyond just simple treasures to also include tiles that score on a turn of your choice or ones that score at the end of the game.  This means there is a decent bit of strategy involved to everything your doing.  At the same time you have to balance needing to deal with the goblin menace and not be left without any of those cards.  There are some additional cards that change up play in mostly standard but functional ways.  It includes a small variation for two players that actually works quite well.  Instead of an annoying "ghost player" each player has an additional equally sized "personal draw deck" which they add one card from to the hand they currently are evaluating.  They therefore get first dibs on one card per drafting turn but also additionally get to pick one card out of the hand to discard.  It makes for a pretty strategic game and I wonder if a lot of those who vote "not recommended for 2 players" have ever actually tried it or are just going with the standard assumption that drafting games work best with 3-4 players or so.

Richard Garfield is a great designer.

He managed to make a drafting game , that has five identical rounds yet is fun to play.
You score in five different categories 
Ice,jungle,lava which are similar
and goblins (you play dogs) which is different from the others but shouldn't be forgotten.
And finally money which is direct VP at the end of the game. No lousy conversion needed. Every number is exactly what it shows.

The mule adds a great push your luck aspect to the game because when you play it, and it isn't in the category that is being scored now or has been scored in this round you will play this.
This is not necessarely a good thing. You could be aiming for the low treasure in jungle or lava and get a high card in that colour.  
I call this a push your luck element because it is exciting to see which card you receive for your mule.
the other push your luck element are the  treasures with scoring goals. when do you decide to go for them. 

Scoring is done each round but after the five rounds. which is perfect.
the card modifiers and the treasures with goals on it all add to the game and how you approach it.

the rules are easy. I have played this with a 6 year old who understood what she was doing. She came in last, but put up a fight and had a good time.

The game is totally language independant and the iconography of the cards is very clear.

For all the above reasons this is a great filler that can be played with the family or casual gamers. If I have 30 minutes to spare on gamenight I might even suggest it.

Richard, Richard... You done rekt this time. Treasure Hunter might be roughly okay and harmless filler if it was not for broken drafting. See, drafting works ok as long as the cards accumulated are used to get something positive. This "something positive" might be something with absolute value or something with subjective value. If it's something with absolute value, it's the same for all players. You are bidding for five points, and five points is the same for everyone. If its subjective, like "get 1 point for every X you have" it's better for some players and possibly close to worthless for others. In Treasure Hunter there are situations where you are bidding for absolute negative points. That is, there are treasures with -8 points for example. That's -8 however you look at it. It if happens to get placed on for example red MAX and you open red 12 on a four player game, you are guaranteed to receive that red 12 as your last card and there is nothing you can do about it. You are now the happy owned of -8 points. The logic in this completely eludes me, but to be honest, the loss isn't great. Even if it wasn't broken, it would be "ok" at tops. Never again.

EDIT: If someone compares this to 7 wonders, please please please don't believe them. This thing has absolutely nothing to do with 7 wonders aside from card drafting.

Simple, but over-produced treasure collection game, where you want to draft the biggest or smallest set of cards to collect different treasures. Works fine, is smooth to play, but is missing... something. After couple of games and you've seen it enough, I think.

Well... It's a small, but fun game in a big box (welcome to the world of Queen Games, your nr. 1. source for buying a lot of air in boxes!). On one hand I think it's perfect as a gateway game with a treasure hunt theme which is obviously great for kids, on the other hand... I just didn't feel engaged. I just didn't feel it provided anything interesting or really novel to me (which is not a problem for crowds who haven't played anything yet). It is playable, it has an okay theme, it... works. Previously I thought I was going to buy it to play with the kids later but I'm not sure anymore.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Perhaps my first impression is a bit lower due to my first game where we played out the string even though the winner was pretty evident after the first or second round. I knew immediately after the second round that my game was done and I lost by over 80 points. I kind of like the concept of this drafting game, but there might be just a few too many power cards in this game that make it a bit too chaotic and unwieldy. I'd play again, but wouldn't ask to play.

Ein einfaches Spiel. Man draftet Karten, sucht sich davon eine aus und am Rundenende muss man alle blauen -> grünen -> roten Karten ausspielen. Der mit den jeweils höchsten Punkten bekommt in der Kategorie die "max Karte (die eigenartigerweise auf der linken Seite ligt), der mit den wenigsten Punkten die "min". Das können fette Siegpunkte sein, aber auch Schätze mit Fähigkeiten oder sogar Minuspunkte, die man nicht will. Dazu gibts dann noch Karten die die Auslage etwas ändern können.
Es hat starke Ähnlichkeiten zu "Die holde Isolde". Was mich jedes mal raus brachte war tatsächlich, dass die "max" Karte auf der linken und die "min" Karte auf der rechten Seite lag. Ja, es stand groß da, aber für mich ist das falsch rum... und desshalb hab ich 2-3 mal die falsche Karte anvisiert.
Einfaches Spiel. schnell erklärt, nicht schlecht, aber kein must-have.

Je n'y ai joué qu'avec la première extension.
C'est un jeu de draft qui est pas mal du tout (la thématique est rigolote et la mécanique tourne bien et étant somme doute ultra classique), mais qui ne restera quand même pas dans les annales.
Je doute un peu de l'intérêt du jeu dans sa version de base (que je n'ai pas essayé), mais quand on me dit que l'extension rajoute beaucoup de piment aux parties, je n'ai clairement pas envie de m'y plonger sans elle.

RATING: 4
Preface: this game and my brain do not get along. I am hopeless at it.

But then again, after several plays, my opinion is that if you're not a particular sort of player - the kind who is able and willing to memorize cards during drafting - this game might feel like a hopeless random mess. It's certainly how I feel about it, and it's not an opinion I often have about board games.

Have a strategy? Hope that the other players don't have the same one, but you can't actually know that. Hoping to get a particular treasure? It might happen, but there's no way of telling. Treasure Hunter is, above all, a game about doing stuff and hoping that a) you'll  be able to pull it off (which you have almost no control over) and b) that you won't get beaten by some other player in that stuff... which you will only learn after you've made 90% of your decisions.

If I ever play this again, I swear I'm going to just pick a random card from each card pile that I'm given, and I'll see how many points I'll get. My guess is, it's not going to be much less than when I played this with a strategy in mind.

This game has potential as a filler.  But as a filler, I feel it should be 3 rounds instead of 5 because it starts to get repetitive quickly, and with some lucky draws, a player can take a significant lead halfway through the game.  If it was a shorter or less repetitive game or there was some progression beyond points from round to round (like the option of saving cards so that I can use any sort of strategy other than hoping for the best in blind, random draws), I'd give it a higher score.

Nem fűztem hozzá nagy reményeket, igazából csak azért vettem meg, mert akciós volt az amazon.de-n és az ingyenes szállításhoz is kellett még rendelés. Viszont nem bántam meg, sőt!

A draftolás miatt egy egészen kiválóan taktikázható játékról beszélünk, ahol lapjaink pontértékétől függően vihetjük el a három területről a min. és max. értékekhez tartozó kincseket. Jó csavar még benne a goblintámadás, így még a kutyákra is figyelnünk kell. Sőt, ha még ez sem lenne elég, van 15 akciókártya is a játékban, hogy még jobban kimaxolhassuk pontjaink számát. A varázstekercsekről nem is beszélve...

Benne volt a pakliban, hogy egy próbajáték után eladom, ha nem jön be, de most már határozottan az a vélemény, hogy maradni fog, kiváltképp mert feleségemnek is nagyon bejön.

Azért az itthoni bolti ára (10-12e akció nélkül, akciósan 6-8e) elég meredek, teljes áron biztos nem vettem volna meg, az amazon.de-n meg kb. 4.400,- Ft-ból megvolt, annyit viszont simán megér. Marad és játszunk még vele. Mert jó. (Egyszerű szabályok, magas játékélménnyel.)

A Társasjátékok Ünnepén próbáltuk ki, és osztatlan sikert aratott. Már a helyszínen meg vettem volna, de még nem lehetett. Otthon meg már persze megvártam a legjobb ajánlatot, így nekem is egy mallos példányom van.
Finoman szólva nem vagyok 7 csoda rajongó, így nagyon meglepett mennyire élveztem ezt a játékot. Szerintem egy draftolós játék így jó: gyors, egyszerű, minden körben izgalmas (ha elrontottad az első kört, még lehetsz jó a negyedikben). A Sushi go!-t is be kell majd szereznem. :P

Richard Garfield (Mr. Magic) hat ja mit King of Tokyo einen richten Knaller rausgehauen. Man hat das Gefühl, seine folgenden Kreationen versuchen das Erfolgsrezept zu kopieren: Einfacher Einstieg, einfache Regeln und hoher Wiederspielwert. Bei Schatzjäger ist es ähnlich: Die Regeln sind mehr als übersichtlich, man kann quasi zusammen die Anleitung lesen und sofort loslegen. Das Spielziel ist jedem klar und man weiß was zu tun ist. Die Spieler sind Schatzjäger und haben es demnach natürlich auf Schätze abgesehen. Zu Beginn der Runde werden Karten gedraftet. Darunter sind Abenteurerkarten in drei Farben (Rot, Grün, Blau) und mit diversen Zahlenwerten. Es gibt dann nach dem Draft drei Gebiete, die von den Spielern geplündert werden, analog der Abenteurerfarben (Rot, Grün, Blau). Wird ein Gebiet geplündert, legt jeder Spieler einfach alle Karten in dieser Farbe ab und es wird geschaut, wer Schätze bekommt. Der Clou: Es gibt immer einen Schatz für den höchsten Wert und den niedrigsten Wert. Da es manchmal auch negative Schätze (mit Minuspunkten) gibt, möchte man eventuell gar nicht den höchsten Wert einer Farbe haben. Aktionskarten lassen die Spieler bei der Wertung noch Einfluss nehmen. Ein Schlaftrank vermindert den Wert eines Abenteurers, das Flammenschwert erhöht ihn. So funktioniert Schatzjäger. Ein umkompliziertes, gutes Spiel für Zwischendurch, was nicht ganz die Klasse eines King of Tokyo erreicht.

Video Review: https://youtu.be/f7Y0kBFTzTY

Richard Garfield will always be one of my favourite designers after King of Tokyo introduced me to the hobby, with Treasure Hunter he has only cemented that fact further. Treasurer Hunter is primarily a game of drafting, but drafting with a lot of tactical thought. You are trying to have the highest or lowest points in three colours and also try to protect your self from goblin attacks. It might sound complicated but it has one of the best rulebooks I've read which enabled me to explain the game to friends after only one read. Highly recommended for fans of drafting.

I don't know what it is about this game, but its simplicity really annoyed me. You draft cards to bid on artifacts, keep goblins away, and make money. That's the whole game. This felt like Sushi Go with a far less approachable theme. The artwork and presentation are fantastic, but that's about it. Greed is still the best card drafting game from Queen.

Treasure Hunter is a unicorn for me, a card drafting game that works out well with two.  There are other games that do a decent job, like 7 Wonders and Race for the Galaxy, but I like the use of a personal draw pile and discard mechanism to introduce additional cards and make the rotation of hands less predictable as I have found in other games.  I may try using this in other drafting games to see if I get similar results.

The emerging trend of 2015 is of medium-light bits-and-pieces games that weld together mechanics pinched from a bunch of other games, doll them up with good production values, and make a really worthwhile experience. Treasure Hunter draws from Fiji, Sushi Go and a Knizia or two and produces a great social drafting game. With typically immaculate production from Queen, it's unlikely to win many rewards, but is undeservedly ignored, too.

Egyszerű szabályok (alig 4-5 oldal), így kezdőknek is könnyen ajánlható.
Kincsvadászok vagyunk, akik egymás után felkeresik a Jeges hegyeket, a Sűrű dzsungelt és a Láva barlangot, ahol kincsek után kutatnak.
Mindenki kap 9 lapot és mint a 7 wondersben, megtart egyet, majd tovább adja a többit. addig megy körbe, amíg már csak egy lapot ad tovább.
Gyűjteni kell az adott hely kincsvadász kártyáit, az akciókártyákat és a házőrző kutya kártyákat is, ugyanis mind az öt forduló után jönnek a Goblinok és lopnak a pénzünkből, kivéve, ha van pl. kutyán elegendő.
Dóri mindkétszer ezekkel nyert, hogy ezeket mindig ki tudta védeni, így övé lettek a Goblin kártyák.

The drafting is theoretically interesting, because you have to balance a bunch of different factors, sometimes want high vs. low, and have to respond to what you can see others drafting.  In practice, far too many rounds are determined by the first draft pick, which means it's really a pure random draw not a meaningful draft.

Note:  the app version plays fast, but the app's rules are terribly translated and buggy, making the game difficult to learn.

i really, really like Garfield and this game! however! the itch Treasure Hunter scratches is the same as 7 Wonders, Sushi Go Party, and even Cat Lady. i do love the way the min and max rewards change each round and the different routes to victory. still, two people in the last game didn't win ANY of the min/max/dogs competitions and felt like they'd been screwed every round no matter their tactics. i like the art and enjoy the gameplay itself, although all the bits can all feel a little fiddly for what it is. in the crowded category of drafting games i'll probably end up keeping whichever game is the easiest to teach and travel with (which wouldn't be this game).

RATING: 6.5
31-10-2015. Rated after 1 play. Very fluffy drafting game in which you are only steered by the tiles placed out. There are 3 rows (blue, green, red) of 2 columns (min and max) and 3 goblins. Each turn, all spaces are filled in with tiles. Some are very desirable, some you really want to avoid. 

TH plays over 5 rounds. After drafting, all players play all blue cads, determine who has most/least, get the treasure tiles, next area. After all 3 treasures, there are goblins. You need to chase them with dog cards or bribe them. At the end of the turn, the player with most dogs gets the bribes.

Game is ok. It's like Sushi Go meets Tschak. Way to big of a box and high price.

A perfectly decent lightweight drafting game with a fair dollop of randomness.  And whilst the issue of getting stuck with a "last card" is not as big as I feared, it is still there.  It's not a bad game at all, but - especially considering who it is by - it's not even close to great either.

Az ötlet nem új, elég nagy hasonlóság van egy korábbi játékkal kapcsolatban, de mivel azzal nem játszottam így ezt tudom értékelni és ez tetszett. 9 lapot draftolgatunk, három színt, pénzkártyát, kutyákat és különböző taktikai kártyákat gyűjtünk. A draftolás után a három szín kártyát kijátsszuk. Aki a legnagyobb és legkisebb értékben rakott ki belőlük egy-egy kincset nyer, ezek lehetnek fix pénzt hozók, lehetnek negatívak, de akár valami kombót nyújtók. Utána a kutyákkal goblinok ellen harcolunk, amivel szintén pénz szerezhető, rosszabb esetben veszthető, ha nem győzzük le őket, illetve a pénzkártyák simán csak pénzt adnak, aminek gyűjtése a játék célja. Fix öt körös játék. Egyszerű, szép, de mégis van min gondolkodni, főleg a draftolási részben, de utána is a taktikai kártyák felhasználásakor. Negatívuma a nagy pont különbség lehet a végén, illetve a játékosszám. Szerintem 4 fővel működik legjobban, hatan már kicsit hosszú lehet és túl szerencsefüggő, hárman viszont nem hiszem, hogy jól működne.

[2015-12-27]
Abszolút jól működik hatan is, ezt nem jól gondoltam az első játék alkalmával. Szóval módosítanék, 4 játékostól szerintem nagyon jó a játék.

[2017-01-19]
Annyi negatívuma van, hogy a gyengébb játékos mögött ülő előnyben van, de ez minden draftolós játéknál előjön. Itt viszont minden erről szól.

Strategy is continually thrown out the window in the drafting as you must ultimately play all your suits of cards at once. So if you are passed cards that you don't want you are forced to play a certain way. The values of the rewards for effectively blind bidding with some action card modification are insanely disproportionate. Not my kind of game.

I made it about 2/3rds through and quit.

Cute drafting game. Sadly, I'm terrible at drafting! Still, this was pretty fun. Each round (of 5), you set 2 treasures in each of 3 areas. Players draft a hand of 9 cards (corresponding to each area), then compare each of the 4 colors. The highest AND lowest card will get one of the treasures (some of which are cursed and worth negative points). The fourth color is slightly different, where you can lose coins to the goblins if you don't have enough strength there. There are also special cards that can modify other card values or have special effects.

It's a pretty good drafting game, actually. I just don't love that group of games so much, and this didn't WOW me.

tl;dr: enjoyable but very light

[person=14][/person] takes on [thing=68448][/thing]. Or something like that. Of course, 7 Wonders used the drafting mechanism that first occured in Magic, by mr Garfield, so it's kind of full circle I guess.
So this is a drafting majority game where you score for having the most (or the least) in certain sets of cards. And there are some extra bits here and there. But this is a very simple, family friendly game. And it plays well, and it is very enjoyable. It's not the greatest game ever, but it has modest goals and succeeds at them, and for that, it's worth a look. It's up to you to know if it's too light for your tastes or not, but for me it's fine for an occasional play.

Utter balls.

If the minimum score reward for a colour is good, then the 1 in that colour is an automatic choice. That will guarantee you win that colour. Take a 2 instead and you'll lose to a 1. Take a 2 and a -2 modifier and you won't win as you must have a score of 1. Take a 3 and a -2 modifier and you'll lose as the tie-break for lowest is the lowest card played. 

Which means that all of the other cards are irrelevant.

The positive scores were mildly more interesting, but not by much. Another terrible Kickstarter mess from Queen Games.

As usual, a solid rulebook though.

Just played it at Essen and it was my favorite of the bunch (which included Colt Express and Broom Service).

Provisional rating, one play at Spiel. I like drafting by passing hands as a mechanism, but it's done best when the cards can be valued differently by different players, and that wasn't often enough the case here. Also, having to play every relevant card for each of the three contests makes the last few drafts potential poison - an inevitable fate you can see coming from the beginning of the hand.

a light OK game with some cleverness but also with a big big shortcoming: it is terribly repetitive. All the 5 turns play out the same, there's no growth of the hunter, no harder difficulties.. nothing changes except the values of the treasures.

Draft card game with trick taking to earn reward tiles. An emphasized or more interesting draft phase because of the larger nine card hand size. Each area (or card suit) has a high and low trick that earns a good or bad reward. Rewards can be simple points or bonuses or multipliers.  Strategy of drafting must factor the distribution of cards dealt in the round with the bonus tiles that are up for bid that match well with your earned treasures. Several special cards alter bid values or the bid rules adds a dimension to drafting because you can no longer factor simple card values by suit. Finally, a sub game of goblins that steal treasure must be managed in your draft strategy by picking up guard dog cards. This is another good depth adding element of the draft. Cards selected to protect your loot from goblins will potentially limit the bid strength for the other treasures. The game seems simple by appearance and explanation and then you get in a few hands and realize there is quite a bit to consider. I really like the risk of getting stuck with a negative reward (that can be on the high or low bid spot!) by suit, considering how to max your bonuses, while managing the damn goblins. Very nice game.

In two sessions this went from shrug to avoid.

Some spiffy ideas, but wrapped in a sweater of nobody cares and why are we playing.

Also some bad ideas that should have been shown the door three playtests ago.

Really fun family card drafting game. Play's fast easy rules but still thinky enough what cards to take. Interesting gameplay either you want to have the highest total or the lowest to get the best treasures.
Or do you wanne go for money or for defeating the trolls.

Played at Essen (2015). I did lose the game rather badly, which may have affected the fun I had. But there was also very little I could do. The artwork is nice, but the game is quite expensive and for a game with such a huge amount of luck I am not willing to pay 50 euros.
 

The game is played in 5 rounds. At the beginning of each round the "treasures" are put on the board. There are four locations through which the party of greedy goblin hunts. The blue, green, and red areas that have actual treasures and the goblin cave. Treasures can have a positive value or a negative. So some treasures (like the stinky slimy boot I found) are not very desirable. Some treasures do not provide a flat bonus or malus but instead give bonus points to certain other things.
 

To get the treasures there is a card-drafting/selection round just as in 7 wonders. There are 3 types of cards: color cards that are played in the red/blue/green areas, hounds that are used in the goblin cave, and "special" cards that will modify your score in the colored areas.
 

Once the card selection is done, the game proceeds mostly in a deterministic fashion with little further interaction. You have to play all blue cards in the blue area. The players with the highest and the lowest scores of blue cards each gain one of the two treasures in that area. Same for red and green. In each area one can play bonus cards like the shrinking potion that reduces the strength of one of the cards one played in hopes of not taking home the stinky boot or getting the minimum score to get the nice goblet. There are cards that raise or lower score and the mule that provides further randomization by having you draw a card from the stack.
 

In the cave there are three opponents that you either have to bribe or fight with your hounds. Those that were

vanquished by the hounds go to the player with the most hounds. As well as the gold the took for bribes from the other players.
 

My gripe with this game is that besides the card selection phase, every other element in the game is random or pre-determined. The only choices the player gets to make is the card selection and when to play bonus cards. This is way too little decision making. It also seems somewhat unbalanced with the hounds and the cave, and it was no surprise that the player who kept collecting all the hounds won by a large margin.
 

I am not willing to play this game again.

Korrekt családi és casual játék, megfelelő mókával és nem direktbe kitolós interakcióval. A sokszor bevált mechanikát (draft) jól használja, ismerős lehet sok helyről, így könnyen tanítható. Kifejezetten ötletes és szórakoztató.

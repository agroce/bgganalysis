This game by Matt Leacock is a must-have for any co-op fan. The gameplay is reminiscent of Pandemic but is sufficiently different so that any co-op fan could happily own and play both. There are less cards than Pandemic and there is no in-game shuffling.  The ships are all amazingly cool.

A brutal [b]Pandemic[/b] derivative.  Lots of logistics puzzles, which works well for me.  Planning is SO important.  I like how the Disasters track works.  The Hood track is reminiscent of Sauron's track in Knizia's first co-op.  I've not seen the show, but the other reviewers say the theme is integrated well.

AKA "International Logistics Management Simulation"

In contrast to Spirit Island, my birthday present can be all alpha-gamer, all the time. Until the dice betray you, that is!

It's super light and it's a little lacking in real heroic flavour - especially problematic if the show isn't as core to your childhood as mine (though Captain Scarlet kicks its ass) - however, it is goofy and fun for those times when you're a bit hung over and magic maze almost brought a table of geeky friends to blows.

For an entirely cooperative game to work for me it has to offer a high degree of thematic immersion to disguise the fact that it is a variable puzzle.  Thunderbirds seemed promising in this respect because I was a huge fan of the TV series as a child.  It ultimately left me disappointed because the toys, the stills from the series and the nice artwork seemed no more than surface gloss on yet another exercise in getting the right resources to the right places under pressure of time.  

Production quality is good, with only Lady Penelope's Rolls Royce disappointing.  The artwork is pleasing.

Very enjoyable game, that captures the theme and feeling of the Thunderbirds.  As usual, Matt Leackock has done a great job of delivering a rollercoaster ride of multiple competing options, tension and relief as the game ebbs and flows.  Gorgeous components and artwork that really captures the theme, although a little too fiddly in some areas - not as elegant or intuitive as Pandemic, but an enjoyable experience nonetheless.  A few more plays will determine if the rating changes, but for now a solid 7.5 for me.

I don't have a ton of nostalgia for the show itself, but it was certainly around when I was a kid and so I would watch it when I came across it. As for the game, it's a nice thematic adventure/rescue game using an engine similar to Pandemic in some regards. The difference here is the inclusion of die rolls and also the bonus Tokens which can grant you different perks, and also serve as part of the currency to beat the enemy's plans. The ship minis are nice, and I like that they've each got their own thematic abilities, one can even carry other ships! Very intuitive, light-to-medium Leacock stuff here and the guy just can't seem to do any wrong. Also has a solitaire variant which I'm thankful for.

I do wish the stickers were easier to put on the units...I don't feel like cutting them, they're so small, so as of this moment I've left them on the sheet and just memorized the Thunderbird vehicle numbers.

I prefer this to Forbidden Desert, which in turn I prefer to Forbidden Island. Though all three have a place in my collection. Island as the ideal game to play with many non-gamers. Desert for similarly light game but with a touch more meat on the bones. Thunderbirds for a more epic game. You probably have to get into the theme though. The big kid in me loves flying around in the crazy vehicles. Really good game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Thoroughly enjoyable for all fans of Thunderbirds. One tries to fly around the world, managing disasters whilst attempting to foil the Hood's schemes. I own this game with all expansions. It's fun to play purely co-operatively, and reasonably challenging. The asymmetrical 1vs4 added by The Hood expansion is great, and adds the extra difficulty and unpredictability of playing against a person and not the game. It would be nice if there was some more blurb about how some of the requirements, or bonuses to cards, actually affect the mission - for example, one might need the pod vehicle "The Mole" to be in Asia to defeat a certain Hood scheme, but there doesn't appear to be any reason why - perhaps one has to remember all the episodes? That aside, the game is lots of fun, particularly when playing with other Thunderbirds lovers - and especially if you get in character!

I played the game finally. Very enjoyable experience. I think that I will play this more than Pandemic as I like the theme much more and in Pandemic it feels that sometimes there isn't much to do in ones turn. I love how how when deciding what to do, you have to accomplish a task (avert a disaster) and at the same time you need to prepare you next move. Avert another disaster or defeat a Scheme.
Great stuff. I want to play again!

2017  Good - Quick playing, simple to grasp mechanics. Really like the Disaster track "conveyor belt"/Schemes mechanic and the Special tokens.  Bad - Some turns can twiddle thumbs with nothing to do, and a bad roll or two at the wrong time can bury you.

Kickstarter edition with expansions and Kickstarter cover

As soon as I saw the game I had to back it.
Although I am pretty bored with Pandemic I think Matt Leacock has done a great job with his Co-Ops but I was looking for a more difficult alternative to Pandemic and the Forbidden-series so I was quite interested. Especially since it is THUNDERBIRDS!!!

Now after the first play I'm quite happy that I bought this... (and I'm still waiting on my expansions. Wow.)

To be honest: it won't be my most favourite game of all time and possible universes. But it is a pretty cool game.

Not only do you have to be at the right place at the right time, no, you need to be in the right vehicle, have the right "co-worker" and the right tools with you. And that's not even it. More often you need everything elsewhere. Now THAT is what makes this game shine.

Yes, you have special powers and special cards and deadly events and devious schemes but that logistic puzzle makes it so special.

On the other hand, that's it. The game is Pandemic with lesser individual impact and more general logistics.
But I like it.
I like it more than Pandemic. Currently less than In The Lab but that might change after a few plays or when I receive the expansions.

Just received the KS package with the core game and expansions and played first solo game.  Initial impression — I like this much more than Pandemic and look forward to playing Thunderbirds a lot more.  For my tastes, I find Pandemic to be a fairly bland game that essentially boils down to card counting.  While sharing many concepts, Thunderbirds is a more exciting game because it is not at heart a game of card counting, helped along because it so so steeped in theme, and polished with amazing quality components to play with.  I rate the components an 11.5!
 
Edit: started with an initial ranking of 8, just bumped that up to 10 — this game is so much fun to play!

I've only played it as single player and I'm hooked onto this game. It's challenging and lose more than I win which keeps on bringing me back.

Originally found it hard to play and did not like it at first. Eventually figured out the game and can't put it down.

Quick to setup and can play a couple of rounds in 1-2 hours (my quickest games was 10 minutes and I lost).

It carries off the theme really well, though it made me expect a much lighter game than this - which seemed fairly brutal even on easy setting. TB5 is a very dull role tho perhaps it would have been better implemented as an NOC/action.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Where Pandemic and other top-shelf co-ops (like Lord of the Rings, and Escape) tend to be games of risk management, Thunderbirds is much more about logistics - getting the right resources to the right place at the right time. I think there is a reason that the good co-ops tend to favor risk management as the decision space to work in, because people naturally have different feelings about risk and it's fuzzy enough that multiple players working it together with different perspectives can come to a better answer than one person working alone. If you have a disciplined mind, logistics of the sort you do in Thunderbirds is pretty straightforward and it doesn't really benefit that much from team debate. Fortunately, Thunderbirds does have a risk element and while I don't feel like it's core to the game, it does mix it up just enough give it some edge. So while I don't find the decision space of Thunderbirds to be as interesting as Matt's earlier co-op games, it's nice that it does something quite different, giving you a different experience. It's also great to play a game with such great polish and professionalism, especially in a genre where the average tends to be so poor.

I had no exposure at all to the Thunderbirds prior to this game, despite my Anglophile background, so I was pleased that the world ended up engaging me as much as I did. On the one hand, there is no question it doesn't capture the magic of Pandemic or Forbidden [Desert|Island]. On the other hand, the production is fantastic and the game design is solid and the combination makes it comfortable and engaging to play. I'm sure fans of the show will adore it for the many ways it pays homage.

I haven't tried any of the expansions yet, but I'm curious about The Hood. The other two (Above and Beyond and Tracy Island) seem to add little but thematic depth (of which the game already has plenty) and so probably are really only of interest to the die-hard fan of the game or the show, but The Hood seems like it could open up the range of the game in a good way.

Surprised I seem to have no recorded plays of this game. I know I've played the final published version a number of times.

Surprisingly simple gameplay, but still has enough depth and theme to keep me engaged.  I don't know about my kids but I have enough nostalgia for the theme that my imagination and excitement fills in the small gaps.  There was some difficulty playing this with just 2, as it made it a little more difficult to get everything in position to help you mitigate the dice rolling element.  I want to play it with 3 or 4 to see if this truly does help.  I am happy with my purchase, and want to add the expansions already.

I grew up watching re-runs of Thunderbirds on TV, and I had the complete set of die-cast metal vehicles.  This game does a fantastic job of replicating the feeling of the show.  Thematically it's great, and the pieces are delightful homages to the die-cast toys I used to play with.  High-quality production with good attention to detail on all fronts.

Mechanically, this game is very similar to Pandemic and other co-op games of that vein.  Players work together to solve crisis-after-crisis, while also managing their time to avoid game-ending super-crises.

Unfortunately every play-through I've done has fallen into either the "wow, that was really easy" or the "holy cow, that was some bad luck; there was no way we could possibly have won that" categories.  That's not to say the game isn't fun, just that by nature of the game's randomness it seems most games either feel too easy to be truly satisfying or too hard and feel demoralizing.  It's still fun, but could be better.

Also, the balance between some of the characters' and vehicles' abilities seems skewed.  For example, Gordon, the pilot of T4 (the submarine) has a potentially fantastic ability, but is hobbled by the nearly-useless submarine.  With T2 needed to transport support vehicles and the fact that T4 can't carry a second player it means that Gordon is often effectively marooned in his uselessly-slow submarine.  The expansion that adds Parker and his boat mitigates this problem somewhat, but not completely.

Overall this is a fun game for anyone who's a fan of Thunderbirds (or who just likes Pandemic but wants something a little different). It has a tight combination of mechanics and theme, but a few balance issues and higher-than-I'd-like variance in the luck mar its score slightly.

A solid 8 for this, tempted to go higher but by the Geek system, will I 'always' want to play this? I think Leacock and Modiphius have knocked this out of the park, and I actually think it is better than Pandemic, if similar in intent. The decisions aren't as obvious, needing thoughtful planning if you aren't going to strand a character, rendering them useless until their turn comes around, or watch helplessly as a disaster you can do nothing about progresses to inevitable doom. 

OK, I admit to being biased having grown up loving the show, but the theme has been nailed too. Play feel, graphic design, models, all bang on. Our first play with four proved highly entertaining, even if the others weren't quite as convinced as me. If you don't know the show it'll still be good, the game shines through.

I wasn't really convinced by a read of the rules as to whether the gameplay would be anything special - some action point puzzle solving to gain modifiers to a dice roll resolution of crises. However, nostalgia and the production quality, pushed me on-board for the KS.

After a first solo play I am however pleasantly surprised. It actually isn't anything more than a fairly standard solo puzzle solver but the puzzle is quite interesting and engages with the theme very well. The dice add tension and there is a lot of variety in terms of pending disasters, Hood schemes and the like. 

It does nothing to solve the usual co-op game issues of the possible alpha player but it is a solid design and if you are of a certain age the nostalgia factor adds a point to the ratings.

UPDATE - first try multi-player was fun and the expansions have now arrived and there is a lot of variety here. For me, better than Pandemic.

Nice, colourful cooperative game, themed on the Supermarionation television show from the 1960's.

Players are the Tracy brothers, who are members of the secret organisation, International Rescue.  This is a high tech outfit operating out of a secret base in the South Pacific, completing missions and trying to thwart the schemes of the nefarious bad guy, The Hood.

Simple cooperative game, easy to teach, and must more interesting (to me) than shovelling cubes around in Pandemic.  Good stuff.

So, all my plays have been solitaire and much like Pandemic I don't feel much desire to play multi-player. I just don't find as much enjoyment in these style games with other people as mainly they feel like a puzzle with a most efficient solution. Here there is a little less than that but not enough to create a desire to play with others. That said, it is the best of the bunch. I really appreciate the way you have to use teamwork, to hop the characters on ride alongs on the various Thunderbird vehicles and plan ahead getting resources where they need to go effectively. It feels a bit like a logistical puzzle except some poor dice rolls could through all those plans out the window. Starting off I had fair success in the game, but for whatever reason my past few plays have been horrific failures.

Interesting Game.  Logistics mechanic where you have to move resources & characters around the board to complete missions. Having the right resources in the right areas gives you a roll enhancement.  the first play was very challenging as you have to deal with the disasters quickly, and we did not realize how quickly more disaster cards were turned over.  The second game was much more successful. Card quality is great, artwork from the show is fantastic.  To enhance the experience we put an episode on in the background to enhance the game play which worked really well.  

Game play is fun for even those that don't know the theme very well.  At first I found people were scared of the game as they did not understand the theme.  once we got into the game everyone really enjoyed it.

apparently THUNDERBIRDS is awesome and the b/f will be buying this the moment it hits the shops.

This one its interesting if a little simple. 

The b/f is a huge thunderbirds and he is very happy that the gameplay ties so nicely to the thunderbirds theme. Every mission is based upon an episode of the show and to complete the mission you need the tools that were used in said episode. This is enhanced with them utilising the original 1960's artworks and stills :)
This is amazing if you happen to be a fan.  

I suspect there is more depth to this that the first play through indicated. 

The models are pretty good and the little character models fit well into the Thunderboirds, although why the hell is Thunderbird 3 orange?! It should be RED!

The minis are a little disappointing, but not bad. They're small, and these ships are such a huge part of the appeal of the show. I like the colors and iconography. The appeal of this game is primarily limited to those who like the show, which is fine. Others will just have to trust me that the show was great fun! (Since I am also a Tracy, I am required by law to like this game)
Having played solo, there are serious logistics to contend with, giving the game a nice puzzle feel. Overall, it's quite enjoyable and pretty easy to set-up.

Thematically, I love thunderbirds. I think they went a little overboard with minis (too many thunder machines) but that's hardly a complaint. We find ourselves only using 4 or 5 (out of 15?) each game but it's great. I'd play it a lot more but the only one who shares my enthusiasm for it is my daughter. Fun co-op by the guy who designed Pandemic.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
Excellent cooperative game, the best from Matt Leacock so far. It may be a bit on the easy side, but I like how it requires planning and team coordination, more so with more players. It's an engaging logistical puzzle in which you move characters, Thunderbird machines and pod vehicles to specific areas, in order to prevent disasters or improve your odds at rescue attempts.

The advancement of the Hood (the villain that the players must stop) can be a little random with the dice and thus end the game abruptly with a few bad rolls, but otherwise it is not much of a threat. It might have been better to have added some more "the Hood advances" cards to the disaster deck and eliminated him from the dice. Usually, the real danger comes from unsolved disaster cards.

The theme is well implemented. I don't really remember much of the TV series, but it seems, from what I have read, that the disasters are closely tied to the episodes, requiring or giving bonuses to characters and vehicles used in them.

The production is pretty good, too, including nice miniatures. The box could be smaller or at least have a plastic molded insert, but I expect to fill it a little more with expansions.

Really nice logistical co-op game, with great flexibility for upping the difficulty with repeated plays. Plus, it's THUNDERBIRDS! Plastic models of all fave vehicles, plus the ability to load TB4 and pod vehicles into the back of the TB2 model. Rescue scenarios all lifted directly from the original 60's series, with great art style and images. Wish fulfilment doesn't get any better than this game. 

Only slight downside, not all the characters are great to play - might as well take John Tracy out of the deck before you start.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
There are only so many ways that you can do a co-op game and this feels very much like a reworked Pandemic with the addition of dice. The Hood (effectively the game timer) is moved by both the Disaster deck and the dice, so a game could be lost in just a few minutes if you get some bad rolls. For me this isn't as good as Pandemic as the fantasy theme means you feel less connected to the catastrophe you're trying to avert, but lashings of nostalgia for kids of the 60s.

RATING: N/A
1-4 players. By Matt Leacock. A co-op game. Includes dice, but this isn't a dice game like Pandemic: The Cure, so this game is more susceptible to quarterbacking, and I assume it's less exciting too. I didn't bother watching any gameplay videos. I should watch gameplay videos if we end up playing Pandemic: The Cure a lot.

I have been a huge fan of Thunderbirds since watching the series at age 5, so I relish the chance to take command of International Rescue, fly them off on missions around the world and defeat the Hood. It plays like a whole series of Thunderbirds, with cheesy catchphrases only included if you supply them.

Positives: Definitely Thunderbirds, cards match favourite rescues from the TV show and Thunderbird 2 even opens for loading with pod vehicles! The models supplied are very good indeed, to the extent that each teeny-tiny Tracy peg has been individually sculpted. Variable degree of difficulty from Intro up to Legendary without changing any of the game mechanics. Single player option, which is always good when you've got the itch but your friends are busy.

Negatives: Can be difficult to access for non-fans, especially in larger teams as play can drag a bit while you wait for your turn, even more especially if you get stuck somewhere without a fast Thunderbird. Depending on the character and disaster cards drawn at the start, the game can be lost before it's even begun. On a purely nerd level, some of the rescues are bunched onto the same card because they took place in the same episode when they should really be dealt with separately.

Decidedly different feel than Pandemic. The dice resolution isn't as terrible as I feared. Good preparation goes a long way in mitigating the die rolls. A good logistical puzzle although prone to alpha player domination (me!). Not all characters are similarly interesting. Thus, probably best as a solitaire game. This, the distribution and the offbeat theme are all reasons why Thunderbirds flew under the radar and is already sold off two years after release. A pity, I like the retro charm induced by the theme and the original artwork.

Game is not bad, but it is so much build around theme and TV series that if you are not enjoying that or you do not know that, it will greatly reduce your enjoyment.

Given that I am from Central Europe it was never aired here and thus theme was little alien to us. It was funny to feel like heroes traveling all over the world and trying to overcome Hood, but overall it was still feeling like normal coop game and after few rounds it was pretty obvious what to do and biggest issues was how to roll that damn rollcheck :].

I think this is probably biggest issue of coops if they do not have theme which you absolutely love they can to easily become too mechanic, there is also treat of alpha player. All of this can be avoided either with realtime element or some hidden goals (either ala BSG where someone is traitor or just by hidden goals like Dead of Winter).

KEEPER SOLO
I steered well clear of this when it came out. I was a sixties kid and the original Thunderbirds is part of my DNA (Virgil was my alter ego). So this was always going to be a no-no for two reasons. 1) Board gaming is adult stuff - I'm retired now and have no intention of reverting to my childhood. 2) The artwork is bright, garish and not as grown-up as the programmes themselves were. Anyway I love Leacock designs for playing solo. I found this cheap, succumbed and all I can say is that it's FAB and my inside knowledge (knowing who pilots what, the gear and the disasters) finally has a use after all.

After a video review: I don't know much about the theme, but the game seems pretty simple and accessible. It can suffer from lack of stuff to do in certain situation, Eldritch Horror had the same situation and they brought in focus tokens. So  I think something similar could be used. Or maybe you can spend 1 or 2 action to collect a random token (just improvising here)

I think it's worth a try.

I loved the TV series, but this isn't Thunderbirds, it's Eddie Stobart the boardgame. 
"We need a pink car and a big drill in Asia tomorrow" 
"OK boss I'm on it"
Suffers from all the normal co-op game issues; Alpha player, randomness disguised as tension, puzzle rather than game.
A good way to introduce newbies into the hobby (if you let them drive), but otherwise ultimately a soulless exercise in pushing plastic bits around. 
And T3 is so warped that it resembles something from a British Trident test firing.

Once you get the main idea for winning the game is not tense enough. It is possible to lose but it feels like most of the choice are "finding the right decision" and have little to do with strategies and orientations. I like when know that I have to do some sacrifices to win in cooperative palys, and here it's not the case.

We played by adding one extra event at game set-up and it make the first part of the game more dynamic, with better chance of losing.

Had for a week an run through a couple of solos. First multiplayer game tomorrow.........
well we played a four player game yesterday and we all enjoyed it immensely. Characters were Scot,Alan,Gordon and John. we found ourselves under a bit of pressure from the Disaster pack initially as our we failed a few of our missions. John was very helpful in keeping the mission queue in check but sat in T5 for the first half of the game After Gordon's initial issues he made good with a few successful missions and we managed to steady the ship. We kept well ahead on the Hood track and as we got into the second part of the game had a glut of space missions the John and Alan took on with the help of the lady P peg in tow. Gordon and Scot concentrated on the earth bound challenges taking Virgil's peg along where necessary and doing a lot of vehicle jumping transporting a lot of pod vehicles around. We sorted. Out the final IV scheme with a couple of hood spaces to spare and the Disaster queue well stocked but under control with a well timed FAB card removing a troublesome Disaster that we were not really tooled up for. very enjoyable all round and well themed - it took me back to my childhood.

First impression after one 4p game.  I watched Thunderbirds when I was a kid, and that adds to the enjoyment of this game.  It's fun to play it, and those old memories make you feel like a kid while playing.  The looks and style of the show and game  are cooky/corny/quirky enough that it's impossible to take oneself seriously while playing -- bring out the best of heroism without seriousness.  Nice miniatures.  The game mechanics work -- simple enough to get out of the way of playing, varied enough to keep the game interesting.  The cooperative puzzle works and is just the right amount of difficulty, with the option to ratchet up the difficulty.  The addition of die rolls adds a level of uncertainty and excitement to the challenge.  Looking forward to playing it again to see if the initial positive first impression holds with repeated plays, and to try some of the other Thunderbird characters.

Disclosure: I never watched the show as a child, or at all for that matter. 

This it is a top notch production. The miniatures are very nice, although a little fiddly when removing and placing characters in different vehicles, but a minor quibble at best. The board was very easy to use and clear. The mechanics of the game worked very well and were simple (in a good way).  It felt like the game was quite balanced (only 1 play in) and we lost... barely. So it felt similar to co-ops like Pandemic (also by the same designer as T-birds) where it comes right down to the wire. An overall enjoyable game. I definitely like the fact that designers are making quirky games like this. It brings me hope that one day I will see some oddball theme(s) that make me smile, and feel like a kid again!

Having said all that, this game is for those seeking the nostalgia of the T-birds IP. So the theme's "immersive" factor was lost on me. I will play this with my friends who love and appreciate it, but honestly, there are many other co-ops I would much rather bring to the table first. For me and for others who are not familiar with the Thunderbirds IP, I would suggest a different co-op that speaks to you thematically. Pandemic, Flash Point: Fire Rescue, Police Precinct, even The Grizzled etc are (in my opinion) all easier themes to get into. You don't have to be a MD or a scientist to get, or enjoy Pandemic. You don't have to be a Firefighter to enjoy the theme of rescuing people and pets in Flash Point etc. Pretty much anyone can step right into these games and feel involved and interested right from the start. But to really enjoy Thunderbirds as it is meant to be experienced you really need(ed) to be a fan. I feel similarly with Battlestar Galactica. However, with that game I actually watched those old TV shows. I never did get into the modern reboot though. So I was glad when I found out about Dark Moon!! Again a much easier (some might say "generic") theme for most people to get into. But for me, Dark Moon is a much better alternative in every way.

In conclusion: Thunderbirds is a great game all the way around. Nothing I am eager to play again. But HIGHLY recommended for those who love co-ops and the Thunderbirds!

A beautifully presented game that suffers from being basically an overly, rather complicated and difficult puzzle solver with too little progression and very little pay-off for the effort expended. I'd guess it might become more straightforward with repeated plays, as you get on top of the best approaches to resource management, etc, but its lack of any fun factor (beyond gorgeous components and graphic design) mean it isnt one that will be hitting the table again.  A disappointment - stick to Pandemic for your heavier Leacock fare. For all its fantastic production values, this game is a dud.

After 2 solo games, one of which ended very quickly when I couldn't resolve the disaster, I am quite taken with this game.
Being a big fan of the original TV series ( not the film or the cgi series), I was concerned that the game may not live upto expectations. But it does, and it does so in style.
The game is quite a puzzle of planning ahead to get the right Thunderbirds and characters in the right place with the right equipment in order to thwart the Hood and resolve the disasters.
I'm looking forward to multi-player games and increasing the difficulty level.

The game is absolutely beautiful but the two four-player games left me cold.  I got only one turn done before we lost the first game and I got two turns done before losing the second game.

Perhaps we were missing a crucial rule or the game is too difficult with four players?

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]I haven't played this one since last November, but only because I haven't had the opportunity. It certainly made a great first impression although I think part of it was the group I played with. We all got into our roles and had a lot of laughs, of course that's a credit to Matt Leacock for creating a game play experience that facilitated that. The game play itself was fun, if a bit standard for the co-op genre but again the theme really pushed this one over the edge for me. Thinking about it now I could almost see my family playing this one, but co-ops never fair well in our house. Still if it came out with my game group I'd happily play again.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]My biggest surprise of the month, especially considering that I'm not a huge fan of co-ops. The game play was both fun and familiar (I think I've played all of Matt Leacock's co-op games) so we were able to dive right in after a very short rules explanation. For me it was the theme that made this game truly shine even though I'm not huge Thunderbirds fan; it was the fact that all of us role played our characters making the game extremely funny and a blast to play.[/i]

In terms of the feel, it's more similar to Ghost Stories than Pandemic. The pressure is on to grab chits to overcome the disasters (ghosts) that arrive each turn before you become overwhelmed by them. The disasters are a bit more interesting than ghosts (you need to be somewhere and you can get optional die roll bonuses by getting certain things there) but in the end it still comes down to a die roll. Movement and co-ordination considerations are a touch more intricate. I like the dual time pressure of having to fulfil the mission/event track before too many epidemic/bad-dice-rolls forces a loss as well. The theming is great, with the soundtrack only ever a successful disaster resolution away. Enjoyable.

A strongly-themed co-op game that feels very true to its source. The co-op aspects are enjoyable, but it does seem to be sensitive to the balance of characters in play. A game without John Tracy, for example, would feel very hard to win.

As an fan of the show I can see how knowing the show adds to game-play enjoyment.  Lots of opportunities to mimic the characters and the scenes, great for laughs.  It is challenging to plan out and execute the actions and operations, some of which are necessarily complex as characters, equipment, and locales need to be factored in.  The game pieces are nicely detailed, down to the character's individual faces.  Clearly an easier play for 3 players than for 2, but with 2 players there is no letdown because you'll need to stay engaged in  each other's moves.  Recommended for fans of Pandemic, highly recommended for fans of Thunderbirds.

(8 plays)  (4 and 4)  This game requires a very good grasp of logistics.  You need to plan ahead and use as many actions as possible on the current threats, and help along future threats with any extra actions.  Dropping off that one pod vehicle with the extra cargo space in Thunderbird 2 could make all the difference.  Should Virgil come along for the ride, then jump into Thunderbird 1 at the destination 'cause it will help a disaster resolution a couple of turns from now?  Better make sure you don't miss that opportunity!  If you know some people that really love working through a very challenging puzzle together, this careful and calculating game could be for you.  It's quite compelling as a solo game, and I think that may be the best experience.

It will be interesting to try 1 on 1 Play the Hood - but I wonder if the hood player will be kind of bored.  Maybe the sand timer helps - if it doesn't make the game too hard.

It's a really fast paced co-op that's really tense and far from obvious to win. It doens't happen that much that the players at the table wanna play again and even a 3rd time as they just wanna win :D

Excellent Leacock design, perhaps my favorite of his to date, that marvelously captures the feel of its thematic source.  Components, especially the cards, are of very high quality.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
After watching the video I like that that Pandemics bones are visible but Thunderbirds is fleshed out with different narrative elements: the disaster cards provide a variable episodic narrative arc, its payout successes are needed to address the overall story arc - the Hoods schemes. Throw in flavoursome events in the story arc and it seems to weave an interesting logistical and tense adventure. Sadly the theme suffers from the era where there wasn't much female involvement compared to Pandemic.

My wife is really into co-ops, and is a particular Pandemic fan, so it is natural that she backed this game on Kickstarter (since it has the same designer). We've only played in once, with 4 players - and I definitely preferred it to Pandemic, but still without thinking I'd ever play it again with any great enthusiasm. (That's not the same as saying I'd refuse to play if asked to, though. "Meh" is a good word for my feelings on this game so far.)

Almost as good as I hoped it was going to be - but my bar on this one was insanely high.  Yes, the pegs are a little tight (but better too tight than too loose); that's about the worst I can think of at the moment.  It will survive enough games to be a worthwhile KS back, and may end up in the standard rotation.

Pleasantly surprised by this one. It seems like it might just be a cheesy co-op trying to make some money off nostalgia, but it turns out they created a pretty entertaining game here. You've got objectives, and so you're wandering around the board trying to get various things to different places and all the cool vehicles make for an interesting puzzle to optimize how to get the various people and items around the board. What's also cool is that there's a couple of different timers that you're working against and so you have to balance how you try to accomplish progress on each side of them.

Very much designed and produced game. Feels like a dicey version of pandemic with an awesome theme, but has some aspects of its' own giving it a unique feel.

Its' a touch on the easy/bland side though, and I'm really hoping the expansions (I kickstarted) will drive things up a notch.

Still brilliant as a gateway though.

Enjoying quite a bit, with two players so far.  Game-play is similar to Pandemic, perhaps a bit less harsh (so far just beginner and normal levels).  Thematic elements are excellent.  However if you didn't grow up with the series, your rating might be 1-2 points lower.

The design process seems to have centred around providing the very best gaming experience to pay tribute to the series. Everything you'd want to be in there is there - Thunderbird 2 carrying 4 around, Lady P, The Hood, all the disasters from the series. The game is well designed, easy to teach, tough and fun. The only thing missing is Parker.

To start, this is a good game and I enjoy it.
While strategy and good planning is key, luck elements that come from dice rolling can take over at times.
After quite a few plays we seem to win most games even on the harder settings, am awaiting the expansion to get more level 5 scheme cards to add more variety on the hardest level.

The character pegs barely fit into the thunderbird machines.
The white font with red borders on all the cards gives the impression of a print error.
The player aids contain the action details, but not the operations details.

Already lost several 3-player games in "Intro" mode because the Disaster track got filled to the end... Not so "Easy" after all...

I must say it captures the Thunderbirds theme & thrill very well indeed!

I found this rather disappointing when compared to other Matt Leacock games. It lacked the tension of his other games, despite many of the mechanics being shared with them. It seemed to be a little over-engineered, and I am not sure that the character pegs and vehicles worked particularly well, as it was rather fiddly switching them around. I may well have misinterpreted the rules, but in the game I played it was rather too easy to stay on top of the disasters, and I and the other players found ourselves hoping and waiting for disasters to escalate so that we had a challenge to face. The production values are very high, though, and the rulebook is well written and well laid out. I'm quite prepared to give it another chance and see if my opinion changes, but it isn't a game I am chomping at the bit to play again, sadly.

Interesting co-op in that it starts at a frantic pace then never really lets up - so missing that build in tension that is a positive feature of so many co-ops. The puzzle is one of logistics, made more complicated by being able to see the next 4 or so turns into the future with almost perfect information. Much of the debate is therefore what actions to take 3 or four turns from now. Playing time can vary wildly depending on your series of disaster cards - One game lasted 2.5 hours as we keep on top of the disasters but couldn't tip the balance in our favour. On the other hand you can beat this within 15 mins if you are lucky. Occasional fun for seasoned co-opers who enjoy the kitch factor, but it struggles to make a solid case against the wealth of good co-ops out there.

Provisional rating after a couple of sessions. Seems a fine co-op, not easy to beat and requiring some careful forward planning for the whole group, but with no mechanism to prevent an alpha player taking command of that planning - that's a comment rather than a criticism.  Though I didn't really grow up with the Thunderbirds (I'm more of a Captain Scarlet man) it's a great theme and one very well represented in the art, design and components.

RATING: 10
As a Thunderbirds fan since childhood, I couldn't resist the kickstarter for this game, and it's proved to be some of the best hobby money I've ever spent.  The components are lovely, the rules are easy to learn but full of subtlety, and it is so evocative of the series, it's like taking a holiday among the palm trees of Tracy Island.  It works beautifully as a solo game and with friends, being simple enough for even casual gamers to pick up, but the tension really builds when the disaster track is filling up and the Tracy boys are rushing from one side of the world to the other, desperately holding calamity at bay.  And all the while with the looming presence of The Hood and his nefarious schemes.

I also pledged for the expansions...can't wait to add those to the game!  Thoroughly recommended.

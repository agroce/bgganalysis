Nice light card game. A little too much luck of the draw but regardless the games have been close and there is some decent amount of decision making.

RATING: 8
Words people have used to describe Herbaceous:
Peaceful, Relaxed, Calm, Pleasant, Friendly

That's not just Beth Sobel's excellent, evocative artwork.  The open information makes the game play pretty clear, and the uncertainty of draws is shared by both players.  Try to get cutthroat and you'll probably be congratulated on your good timing by your opponent.

Excellent game.  Makes me hungry.  I'll probably put a cloth with some essential oils under the insert so the game smells like Mint and Thyme.

Hmm. Well, it is simple to play. And it is pretty. I've only played it with 2-players (which is why I bought this) and the decision space is limited. There is tension in choosing to keep or share. The other decision is of course when to pot - which feels like a push-your-luck game. I like it for that.

Herbaceous is a very fun little game.  The game is very nice looking and the table, which really adds to the enjoyment of this small title.  Also, all players should be paying attention to what others are doing at all points during the game as what players are placing on the general area impacts everyone all the time.  

I very much like this one as a light filler.  There are enough decisions along the way to keep me entertained.

Just some cards and very simple rules to collect some cards from the shared group and your private group of cards to fill up containers for points. Then, draw 1 card to either the public or private location and 1 more card to the other location. It's not bad and also maybe too simple without enough terribly interesting decisions.

Such a light, quick, and fun little game. The competitiveness balances well with the press-your-luck, so you can thwart other players without it feeling too mean. The artwork is gorgeous, as you can see from any of the photos, and it's really satisfying to play with such beautiful cards. I played one game with my sister and she immediately wanted her own copy. It's pretty much a hit with anyone I've shown it to.

Pleasant card game of set collecting that is similar to Biblios. Game play is simple and games are played in less than 20min.  It's nothing spectacular, but it fills the time nicely. Seems to play well with all player counts, too. Team variant works great, as well as the solo variant, which is just high score. I would prefer to play Biblios if I was going to choose.

RATING: 7
A decent game of collecting herbs to put into pots. The pots can only be used once so there is a bit of push your luck to determine when to pot as the player before you could take the cards you want but that decision feels a bit bland. This game also copies the Biblios rule of drawing 1 card at a time and having to make a decision on where to put it from 2 possible options so looking at that first card is always tough. I worry there are not as many decisions as in Biblios, but still might be worth picking up for games with the wife.

RATING: 8.5
Very light and relaxing card filler with pretty illustrations and peaceful theme and gameplay. You are trying to plant the best sets of plants into few different containers (in one you need only plants of the same type, other wants one of each different types, next one is for doubles and the last one is for any three plants - serving primarily for planting bonus herbs with extra points).
Each player has his own private garden where he can put plants for just his own use and there is one community garden where are herbs which anyone can use. In your turn you pick one card and decide where it goes (private or community garden) and then pick second and put it to the next one (In solo there is also discard pile).
There is some kind of push your luck mechanics - do I want to plant the container now or wait a turn and risk the opponent would use the needed plants in community garden for himself?
If you can collect 1+2+3 points herbs into the glass jar container first, you will receive 5 points bonus (some kind of biscuit). So you should watch opponent if he can do this and try to avoid him to do it if possible.

What I like:
- This is just a quick, easy game with cca 5 minutes per player gameplay including setup. This means you can finish several games easily in a session (ideally as a starter before another bigger game). 
- The game play is very relaxing, although the theme is pasted on, I actually can feel it - which is strange because I usually don't care much about theme in this sort of games. It is partly because of nice artwork full of warm colors and peaceful herbs.
- Although it is very light, there are some interesting decisions to be made (do I pot now or wait a turn, where should I plant this herb I drew - personal or communtity garden - do my opponent need this herb? and if I took it to my personal garden, can I take the risk that the next card will be even better for him?). This is similar as in Biblios.
- There is also interesting solo variant which plays a bit differently, but simulates the two player game well. I prefer multiplayer variant for this game, but solo is also very clever. My minor concern is that it is so quick that it ends before you can blink an eye. Also it is beat your own score solo (you cannot lost there).

What I dislike:
- Setup compared to the game time is longish. I know, it is just shuffling the cards and removing some number according to the player count (36 in solo, 24 in two player games etc.), but still it took couple of minutes which is a lot compared to the game length. And I know that in solo game exactly half of the deck is removed so you can cheat with doing two same piles and then play two games with them, but I prefer not to as you would know the numbers of plants in second pile (mainly bonus herbs) so you can play accordingly.
- Solo variant is lot about a luck of the draw. Don't expect some big strategy there. You can work around it, but your high scores will arise thanks to the lady luck.

RATING: 5
I've played this a couple of times at 2p, and a couple at 4p, and it is a very different game at each count.

2p was... boring.  There was little competition, we each managed to fill out all of our pots, and the game was decided by a couple of points (and we rarely got the Herb Biscuit).

4p was much better.  There was a LOT more competition.  If you didn't take herbs on your turn, there was a very high probability that they weren't coming back to you.  Plus, if you didn't act quickly (and thus score less), you probably wouldn't get to fill one of your pots (or end up filling it with 1 herb).  I like this tension a lot more.

The game has a very interesting Push-Your-Luck element, but it is 100% player driven.

Looking forward to trying out the solo mode.

This still will compete with Arboretum (which is less luck-depended and more brain-burny) and Archaeology (which seems to offer a similar PYL experience).

Not worth keeping around as 2p wasn't very interesting for the time it took.

A really nice filler which can be explained in a minute and played in fifteen. This is a set collection push-your-luck game with outstanding graphic design. These herbs look so appealing and realistic! It's worth playing just for the aesthetical reasons. 

In terms of decisions, Herbaceous doesn't offer much - it's just whether you want to collect your herbs right now and get less amount of points, or you want to risk and MAYBE achieve more... if others won't take plants from the common garden! I believe this game gets better as you play with the same people, for the reason that you know them psychologically and how they behave in certain situation - you can basically read in their minds and use it for your advantage. Also, there's a significant element of push your luck, as you can see the first card and decide where it goes, but the second one goes where the first didn't and you simply don't know what it will be. 

That's it. A very pleasant game. It can't reach a rating above 7 because it's a filler, and no filler blows my mind(at least it didn't happen yet). I wonder how it plays in teams. Has to be interesting and maybe decision making will become more important. Who knows. For its price? I cannot recommend it more.

Unique card game that looks really pretty, is not very deep, but allows for some moments of strategical contemplation.

RATING: 8.25
As it claims to be, a beautiful game with a fresh theme. This set-collection game combines a refined version of 'chicken' in the environment of your own herb garden. The artwork is delightfully flavorful (pun certainly intended) and was a high selling point for me. The game itself is relaxing to play and grows in complexity with more players. The mechanic of picking one card for yourself or the community garden and having the next card planted in the other spot is surprisingly fun. It's a simple game to pick up and after each first time playing the group was ready to play a second game. An enjoyable, light game for family and friends alike.

Why this is not a 10:
-> Relaxed gameplay pace isn't for all occasions

SOLD IT! ($8)

This is a pleasant little game to play with a unique theme, and I hate to say, but it is the kind of thing that may very well appeal to your mother (or others that may meet the gardener stereotype). The fast drafting play style has similarities to Biblios to keepthe game quick and engaging, yet this one suffers as a push your lick game since others have too much control of your destiny. It is impossible to openly go for a large hand when all oer players have control of half of it. In the end everyone just aims for the workable middle ground, making the game feel unclimactic.

Bardzo przyjemny i szybki fillerek z mechaniką push your luck. Przyjazny nowym osobom, rodzinie, ale i doświadczonym graczom może się spodobać. Przenosimy zioła do prywatnego i wspólnego ogrodu, opcjonalnie możemy zdecydować się na przesadzenie zebranego setu do jednego z naczyń. Trudno mówić tutaj o strategii, ryzykujemy i czekamy na dobrą okazję i zestaw kart, licząc na to, że nikt ze współgraczy nie zgarnie go nam sprzed nosa. Gra ma w sobie coś uspokajającego, w tym aspekcie kojarzy mi się z Kanagawą, odnośnie której mam podobne odczucia, co oczywiście na plus. Ziółka wciągają na tyle, że chętnie rozegra się więcej niż jedną partię. Dobrze działa we wszystkich składach, choć na 2 osoby opcji jest najwięcej, a na 4 gra dosyć szybko się kończy.

What I liked: 

1) The smell of the cards: I don't know if anyone else noticed it, but I pointed it out to my friend and he agreed. They smelled great, just like clay pots or soil. I don't know if that was intentional or not, but we both loved that. 
2) Easy game to learn
3) Easy to setup
4) Has a great solo variant that just as fun to play
5) Play fast. My first time player learned it and played it against me, and won the game in about 35 to 40 minutes
6) Theme was OK. You plan some herbs, then pot them at the first opportunity to get the biggest crop
7) The art on the cards was neat. 

What I didn't like: 
1) I can't think of anything that really bugged me much except maybe a little bit about the rules for using the Jar. I wasn't sure if I could mix other non numerical cards in with other cards to get a total of 3 cards.

Perfect for parents or even grandparents.  I have played this game with my grandparents before and if they are at all familiar with any type of rummy, it will not take them long to catch on.  Plus, it features beautiful herb artwork and plays simple and quick.  The only deceptive thing is how quickly the game ends.  With 4 players, you can't even think about getting 7 of a kind; you'll be lucky to get even 3.  But all in all, a good game to pull out when you're sitting at the table and want something different than your standard deck of cards.

As a decent set collection filler, Herbaceous is another entry in the filler card game field.

Herbaceous is an interesting little set collection game, which forces a public card and a private card to be blind drawn each turn.

Players have the 'Let's Make a Deal' option to keep the 1st and leave the 2nd available for others to use, or to share the 1st and keep the 2nd- which can be an obvious choice, or a more interesting one.

The 4 types of sets being built have to be cached in game time- and they can use private and public cards, so there is also the choice between taking publicly available cards off the table, or letting them build another round with the potential of gaining more points overall.

That is the most interactive point of the basic game- will George or Linda take that before I do- and how many card(s) of this type are left?

Not at all a bad little game, with a solo option and few tweaks/mini-game changes available out of the box.

Simple game that plays very quickly. (20 minutes is accurate.) Each turn you draw two cards; one that must go into your public hand (private garden), and another that goes into a pool of cards in the middle of the table. These cards are drawn one at a time and the decision must be made where to put the first card before drawing the second.

BEFORE you draw, you may score a set of cards: all of the same type, different types, different pairs, or any three cards. Each type of set may only be scored once. When you score, you can pull cards from the middle of the table and/or your public hand. The interesting choice in the game is when to score--do you wait longer so there will be more cards (potentially a better score for you), or do you score now to leave less cards for your opponents?

The card art is pretty, but I wish the backgrounds were more varied in color. Multiple cards have green, purple, or blue backgrounds so sometimes we have mistaken what we thought we were looking at with something similar. Minor "complaint".

A simple and relaxing game of cards, collecting sets of herb cards with beautiful art by Beth Sobel. The push-your-luck element that comes from the community garden generates a reasonable amount of decision-making and post-game talk. Don't forget about the biscuit!

Nice game, but I'm afraid there is not enough meat in it.  Yeah, I know it lasts only 15 minutes, but I own games with such timeframe (e.g. For Sale) or juust a bit longer (e.g. Tschak!, Parade) that offer _way_ more dramatic and meaningful choices.

Impression after 10 plays (8): This is simple, fun, filler game. It is easy to learn. Easy to set-up. I can play with the kids. We like the theme and can enjoy a quick game at any time.

RATING: 6
Herbacious has the ingredients for mainstream appeal: a simple, accessible rule set, an approachable theme, and attractive art. It will be a hit for those looking for agonizing moments of pushing one's luck, but the game lacks much depth beyond that. The damper is that it feels like a simplified version of the drafting phase one of Dr. Finn's previous titles, Biblios. For fans of that game, this will feel a bit watered-down and not as fresh. For everyone else, this might be a good option for a nice, quick game.

This has become a fast hit with my family.  It's got a small rule set, simple/fast turns and a completion time of about 15-20 mins.  The artwork is beautiful and it is very portable with the ability to fit in a deck box as it's all card-based.  It is light and certainly features a fair amount of luck but better players will win more often.  It also has the hallmark of a great game in my house, when we finish I usually hear "One more game...".  Also, I feel like this is an easier game to teach than Biblios (Finn's other masterpiece) and gives a nice introduction to the card flip mechanic used.  Teach this first and Biblios becomes much easier to pick up for newer gamers.

RATING: 6.5
* Kickstarted! *

Gain points by planting the cards you take from the centre in combinations of pairs, variety and specialization. It's a fairly easy system to pick up... but you end up having to rely on strategy a lot heavier because the number of plants are limited and one person's claim could limit your ability to score higher even later in the game.

PLUS: original idea, easy to learn game play
MINUS: no reward for waiting - it rewards fast play

A very simple game that's quickly become one of our favorites.  The mechanic is breezy and fun, a very easily mastered set-forming process, and there's no complex rules at all; but still, there's a good combination of luck, skill, and timing if you want to win.  It's small and portable, which makes it a terrific bar game.

The art is absolutely lovely, a painted garden that's beautifully designed.  It adapts well to group play and has some interesting variants, and since it's got such a sweet and non-violent theme, it's easily introduced in a setting where kids are present.  A real winner overall!

A wonderful set collection game with lovely art.  On you turn you take cards adding one to your private garden and one to the public garden.  Optionally you claim sets from the public and your private gardens to score.  You can get 1 of each suit available, make pairs of suits, make a set of the same type.  Also there is a garden that can take three numbers an if you gat a 1-2-3 before anyone else you get the biscuit and score 5 points.

There is nothing new in this game but the art is so nice and colors so vivid you cannot help but like the game.  I found it a simple fun filler.

Herbaceous is the very definition of a pleasant palate cleanser or even a tasty aperitif. It's a very attractive and very simple set collection/push your luck game that can be played in about 15 minutes.

This game feels like the kind of family cottage card game that will please for years to come.

its nice art to look at but could have been more user friendly

too random for me and mine to like, feels like there should be more control given to the players.  I never felt like I had a difficult choice to make.  Also didn't understand the point to the cute little plant garden label stick.
Its like a game was designed art first
I've seen a few people mention that its to be a relaxing game and I just don't get that.  Why should I let a game dictate how much to care about it?  If I want to relax and play a game them I will and be picking a more fun game.  I am never interested in how this game turns out.  I rather just take the cards and frame them up on my wall, that would be more fun and relaxing.

Quick set collection with an interesting push-your-luck aspect. The combination of a community area and private areas makes each decision difficult. Making the decision to score a set before drawing cards adds a risk/reward element as well, as that card you want in the community garden may not be there on your next turn. Very competitive game without any take-that.

A relaxing end of the night game for sure. Beautiful artwork, and it's easy to teach. The only thing i'm a little iffy on is the special bonus herbs with the numbers on them. If you get all three you score bonus points. But i find this to be a tad random and luck of the draw..which is fine for the gateway crowd, but as a gamer it slightly irks me. But it can be mitigated by stealing one of the special cards in the community garden out from under the opponent, and planting it for yourself. While your Glass Jar may be incomplete, it at least negates your opponent from being able to score bonus points. That's a small quibble though, and it actually adds a nice additional dynamic to the game, bringing a little bit of excitement. So overall i like what it adds. After all, it wasn't designed to be a euro. I do prefer this to Biblios. Biblios is more for gamers and has a nice auction mechanic, but its bland colors and boring theme forced me to trade it away. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I enjoyed my first couple of plays quite a bit. I will say that all these descriptions of the game being 'peaceful' and 'calm' are not accurate - it's not a friendly game. It's about dicking over the other players before they dick you over first - but not too soon. The whole game rides on the timing of when to snatch from the community garden.

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]After a couple of plays I'm still a bit unsure of my thoughts on Herbaceous although I'm leaning towards thinking it may be too light or my taste. I enjoy quick, light games as long as I still feel like I have some meaningful choices to make and so far I don't feel like that in Herbaceous. The problem I've run in to is that it seems like some of the scoring opportunities are much easier to complete than others, so it seems like there is an optimal order to score each of your four pots. 

Mechanics wise I enjoy the game, it plays like a very simplified Biblios minus the auction phase which in turn really limits the player interaction. Instead you are left with a light push your luck vibe since you have to judge how long you think certain herbs will last in the shared garden. Since it is so quick and easy to teach, it is a great gateway game and one I'll play a few more times before deciding if it's earned a spot in our collection.[/i]

I love the art in this game. If you love herbs and the colours purple, green and blue you will love this game simply for the art. I have played this game with 2 and 3 players and found the experience more challenging with more players, due to the push your luck aspect. However, playing with 2 players is also fun! I like that you cant card count because you have to take a certain number of herbs out of the deck before you play. There are also quite a few strategies you can use when playing the game. The hard part, is you don't know what strategy the other players are going to pick!

In summary, if you are looking for a quick game, love gardening, pretty colours and a push your luck style game, than this is the game for you!

I hope you enjoy this game as much as I do :)

First impressions after 4 2p plays: Need to play a few more times to see where the real interaction comes in. Luck seemed to dominate, especially with the Herb Biscuit bonus. I wish there was some mechanism to rush the ending. The game effectively has player elimination in that players who are done need to wait around for the others to finish and the last player has no incentive to stop before all cards are drawn. Not sure if this will be a keeper.

Artwork is great. This is what other reviewers would say first so I guess I will tag along. Feel like some of the rules can be tweaked like how the game is ended. Hard to know when your last play will be. Compare this to a 3-4 player Jaipur. My thumb isn't green enough to really enjoy planting flowers.

This is a simple set collection game that I could play with my parents.  There is a touch of a push your luck strategy - knowing when to uproot the community and plant.

Very light, very simple.  This is not a game I will play often, but there is a wide audience for this.

Beautiful...and dull. I would have scored this a five but it's just so darn pretty and charming so it gets played more than it would normally for what's ultimately a pretty boring game. I will say that this is one of the few games we have that I prefer with more players. We've only gotten to play with four players once so far but it was significantly more enjoyable than two players and more fun than three.

[Dr. Finn's Games 17 Edition] {Herbal; luck-pressing, set-collection, partnership; optimal 3-4p}  Herbaceous is a cute luck-pressing game.  Players have to collect herbs into their containers to score points.  The more you collect, the better score you have.  But to do so, players have to collect cards from the community area and their private area.  Each turn, a player has to play 1 card into the community area and 1 card into their private area.  This is where the luck pressing comes: player draws 1 card a time and determines which area he/she puts the card; then, he/she puts the card into the other area.  So, a player may benefit the other players.

Player interaction is good in this game.  Completing for herbs, and bonus.  And, you don't want to let other players get better cards, but painfully, you can't hurt yourself too much by saving cards other players want, but you don't.

Even though the game states 1-4 players.  I don't see this works well for solo player.

Attracted by the card illustration.  And, it's a design from Dr. Finn, my favourite.

Variants:
+ Team Variant: it's fun.
++ Expert Team Variant: it's fun and challenging.

Box is beautiful and perfectly sized. Production quality is top-notch throughout. Card art is stunning. Here's another sentence to emphasize the card art. Seriously, it deserves special attention. Gameplay is simple but engaging. Theme is unique and refreshing. Box isn't lying when it says you can play a game in 20 minutes. This is a game you can easily play with gamers and non-gamers alike, and should have no trouble teaching to anyone. And as icing on the cake, it's not expensive! Do yourself a favor and pick up this gem.

I'll start by saying that this game achieves what it sets out to do. That is, it's a fine LIGHT game that offers little strategic depth but provides a medium for casual enjoyment. To quote a friend that played this game, "Oh, sure, it's a pleasant game, but I never want to play it again." I love Doctor Finn's Games and I'll always back his projects, but Herbaceous is certainly a niche title. As long as you understand that this is a casual game and that is what you're looking for, then Herbaceous is a solid choice. Otherwise, you may be better suited looking at Docter Finn's Butterfly Gardens if you're in the market for something more gamer-ly.

Beautiful artwork and simple drafting mechanics make this a winner. The combination of private and community draw piles makes this tense as you need to decide how far to push before potting. The limit of potting means locking in your sets before you might otherwise. Having to pot herbs before drawing new cards (planting) is a fantastic design decision, elevating the tension and becomes the heart of the press your luck in this game. Solid design and great presentation.

Herbaceous is a gorgeous gateway game, more than just a simple filler with beautiful artwork. The press your luck element combines nicely with what otherwise would be just another set collection card game. The game play is simple and quick, easy to teach, but also masks the difficulty of the decisions you will make each round, at first.

As with Lotus, the theme and artwork keeps things very serene on the table.  Always a big plus when your gaming group or family don't like to much "take that".

I can see Herbaceous being a nice bridge from something like Ticket to Ride to more complicated point salad styled Eurogames.

Perhaps the best aspect of Herbaceous is a point scoring type of solo variant that is incredibly fun to play.

RATING: 7
Herbaceous is a short filler game. I'd seen it around and the artwork is quite lovely, so I'd wanted to try it for a while.

The game has 7 different types of herb cards (9 of each type) and three types of special cards (3 of each). You'll be collecting sets of cards to "pot" (score). You have four different pots, each of which likes a different type of set.

On your turn, you first, optionally, pot plants (which is how you score), then draw two cards, one at a time, and assign them to either your private garden or the public garden. They must be split between the two, and you must commit the first before seeing the second.

When you pot a set of plant cards into a pot, it is complete. You cannot later come back and add anything to that pot, so timing is critical in the game. You have a pot that likes identical cards, one that likes different cards, one that likes pairs of cards and one that will take any three cards (and this is the only pot that will accept the special "point" cards). Each card has a scoring chart on it, but generally, more cards equals more points.

When you pot cards you may take as many cards from the public offering as you want and augment them with cards from your private supply. Your private garden cards are worth a point each at the end of the game, so you'll want to use as many from the public garden as possible. And additionally if you leave a lot of cards in the public garden, someone else will scoop them up.

After the deck runs out players continue taking turns until everyone has potted as much as they can. Then you score your pots and see who has won.

I enjoyed this game quite a bit. It's lovely. It's quick. There's interesting decisions but a fair bit of luck. It's a nice game to pass the time if you're starting up, waiting for a game or winding down.

Play experience thus far is with 2 players.  Minor issue with 2 players is that there isn't much competition for cards, thus both players mostly score the higher values unless a player is forced to pot early to block the other player.  Would imagine that a 3 or 4 player game would create more competition for the cards and thus result in more varied scoring.

RATING: 8
Lovely and calm. Set collection with an herb garden theme, and Beth Sobel's artwork shines on sturdy cards. It's an enjoyable game, especially since the Mrs. is smitten with dreams of a large herb garden. 

Players plant (collect) 2 herb cards each turn, 1 in their private garden and 1 in a community garden. When ready, players may first pot (collect) herb cards into 1 of the various planters. Each of the 4 planters represent a different set collection goal: single herb type, all different herbs, pairs, and special herbs/card type. The number of cards collected give certain points by planter.

2 player works very well, and I'm positive it will only improve with 3-4 players. The solo game looks solid, although I prefer heavier games for solo play.

PnP has been printed.  
12/2016 - And now played.

The formal artwork has colors  for each Herb, plus the almost completely shaded background.  PnP simply uses gray scale  of the same artwork thus making it extremely difficult for me to use the images to distinguish and recognize the different card types in play on the table.  I end up relying solely on the printed titles at the top.

This is a wonderful, gorgeous little game.  It's simple, but it's easy to teach.  It plays very similar to "traditional" card games, so it's a perfect gateway for someone who is reluctant to try board games.  You'll pretty much never get a perfect score, so there's definitely some strategy involved.  Also one of few games where I have played and enjoy the solo option!

I bought this for my dad when I bought the "Arboretum" game, also. I'm a little nervous to actually give it to him since he still hasn't played the last game I bought him. I might just keep it. I picked it out based on the theme, since my dad is a plant nut, and can't recall much about the mechanics. I believe it can be played with only 2 players.

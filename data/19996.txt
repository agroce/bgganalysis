One of the most bizarre and unique games I've ever played, what would you normally play in a pitch dark room with your gamer friends, well this of course. Use the glow in the dark pieces to navigate the board but don't knock anything off that you can't see. A very simple dexterity game made great by its glow in the dark nature.

04+ or 06+, 2-4 players, best with 4, 20 mins. Shared. With V May 2012. 1 x KMV for OT. 
Wonderful game pieces, very well made. The game was a great success on a camping weekend and a holiday trip to Melbourne family. V's 'strategy' though is to crash through, make a path and win in a couple of moves. Spoils the game completely so strict anti-crashing rules now being written and enforced! younger children need an adult to supervise set-up and play and to help create atmosphere. Lovely game.

RATING: 6.5
{2 plays, 2-3 players} Only played in the light.  First game was over in one turn, which gave me pause.  But subsequent game took a while and was quite tense.  Simple (almost nonexistent) rules, but has that thing that a lot of dexterity games lack: that joyous tension you get when watching pieces move/hang on in seemingly impossible ways... hoping your opponents have blundered, but having to wait, wait, come on, wait for the pieces to bear that out.  Ironically, I really want to try this in the dark, where that delightful visual will be gone.

[2 games later]

Have now played in the dark.  The glow-in-the-dark-ness was quite cool, but it was slightly offset by a) what I said above, not being able to watch the "fun," and b) the inability to see the edge of the board, which meant you often started your turn by accidentally knocking stuff off without really getting a turn.  Still... neat idea, and it was interesting when the games were over to flip the lights back on and see what the board looked like.

i'm pretty awful at rating these kinds of games.  within its context, i'm sure the game rocks.  it's doing exactly what it sets out to do, and does it well.  i think the setup-to-playtime ratio is overloaded, as it often is with such dex games, but this would have to be a smash with kids.  i'm sure if i had some and played it with them, my rating would be higher.  i have no particular interest in playing it again, but i would.  and i should give it a try in the light.

It's short.  It can be played in the dark.  People love this little game.  I love this little game.  The rules can be explained in one minute.  It has little wooden parts that fall off when you move your little wizard (a very abstract wizard, mind you....).

RATING: 6
There are a lot of kids games out there that I have lauded as having a unique gimmick that really adds to the game.  In this case the gimmick is that the game glows in the dark.  This is extremely unique, and isn't something that I have ever seen in a boardgame before.  So I was really anxious to have something this unusual added to my collection.  I will say that this comment is after only playing the game on one particular evening in a room where there was still some moonlight creeping in, so I didn't get the full effect (after a few minutes your eyes would adjust to the dark and you could easily see the pieces.)

The big problem I have with this game is that I don't think there is much "game" to it.  The gimmick seems to be all there really is to the game.  It is a simple dexterity game where you try to push your "magician" through a crowded "forest" in order to push your "cauldron" into the center.  As far as dexterity games go simply pushing pieces around, hoping not to knock over other pieces, seems kind of lame.  I will admit that it is a unique dexterity mechanism but I think that, without the gimmick, there really would be no reason to own this game.  Still I'll probably keep it in my collection because I have nothing else even remotely like it.

RATING: 5
Very pretty but also very simple game. My kids like it but the youngest (age 4) has some problems moving his pawn carefully enough. The pieces easily scatter for him. I would like to try it with four more evenly matched players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Good game if you like the dexterity or glow-in-the-dark genres, just not my favorite kind of game.  Setup is slow, especially due to discs being similar in size and color.  We tried the first moves in the light (yuck!); it was not nearly as fun as playing in darkness and stressing out over how quickly you will hear a piece drop from the board.  If you "charge" up the glowing parts under a strong light, you can use your pawn as a mini-beakon to try to find the edge of the board.  It pays to watch what others have done as you might figure out an empty area of the board to push pieces toward.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This is a solid, beautifully produced game--light, atmospheric and different.  Fun little dexterity exercise where the alarmingly prompt "clunk" as a piece drops off the board always halts your free run of the surface.  Get a nice dark room and have at it!

Really fun to play in the dark, as it's impossible to tell when you're turn will be over!  Everyone's just waiting for the clacking noise.  When played in the light, it becomes a pretty decent tactical game.  UPDATE: Once the gimmick wears off, it's still fun, but nothing too awesome.  It always seems that once one person gets an edge on the other players, that player wil win almost every time.

Another one of those kid games that adults want to play.  Fun & works well as a closer.  Not the type of game that you'd replay in the same session probably.  I took Andrew's idea and cut a circle within the fire ring, so that when someone puts their cauldron in, you're sure it made it, because it disappears and goes "clack" when it hits the table below.

(Kid's Game)

Some people are fans of Canal Mania, I, however, am very glad that a member of my local game group traded that title in for what is probably both my favourite kid's game, and is up there with Villa Paletti in the dexterity game category.

The idea of this game is amusing...the players assemble a large number of wooden pieces in a set design on a slightly raised circular table. At the centre there is a "fire" that covers a "sacred spot" that one wants to get to with a cylinder that has one's symbol on it. This is accomplished by pushing the other blocks around with one's own "wizard piece". This isn't all that interesting by itself, but the game is very charming because the "wizard" pieces, the "cylinders" and the "sacred spot" with the "fire" on top are all glow in the dark pieces, while the other wood blocks are not. Before you set the game up, you "charge" all of the glow in the dark pieces up, and then you hit the lights. You then can push the blocks around with your wizard piece, trying to get your cylinder onto the centre spot. Your turn lasts until one of the blocks is knocked off the playing surface.

The resulting game is fairly random, but fun because of the sheer entertainment of hearing the blocks tumble onto the table after the players have moved their piece about 1 inch onto the playing surface.

The only warning I have for you: this game has to be played in true dark conditions. If it's day, you need to take this into a closet. If it's night, you had better make sure the curtains are closed, because the entire charm of the game is the way you can see so few things.

And now for something COMPLETELY different!  A bit of a novelty -- a glow in the dark dexterity game????  Works well -- very simple and the kids love it.  Can be a pain in the neck to set up (set-up takes about the same amount of time as actually playing the game), but lots of fun once it's going.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Very simple dexterity game. One of those where you wonder why no one has done this before. Supposedly it glows in the dark, but I wasn't able to try it that way. Most dexterity use one of: gravity, kinetics, coordination, accuracy, etc. Not this one. Nothing falls, nothing is in motion. Nothing balances. You just push around a bunch of discs on a circular disc using your "pusher" (all sorts of notions came to mind while playing, but since no one else was going there, I wasn't going to be the one). The goal is simply to push one of your three labeled discs into the hole in the center that is just big enough to allow the player discs to fit in, but nothing else. On each turn, you can use your pusher to push as much as want, starting from a single point, and without lifting your pusher once you've touched the surface. Your turn is over as soon as any disc falls off. Obviously the board gets less crowded as the game goes on. Some discs are tall and look like trees, which is purely for aesthetics, but it works. The game looks beautiful.

Very nice dexterity game!  I'd love to try playing it in the dark some time.  Even in light, it was good fun.  But the setup time is pretty long for such a short game, and the box is pretty big, meaning I don't take it to that many game gatherings.

Great kids game that's fun for adults too. The game glows in the dark. Each player controls a Wizard that attempts to push one of his or her three matching symbols into a ring of fire depression in the center of the board. Non-glowing discs serve as obstacles and if one is pushed of the board, the player must stop moving his or her Wizard immediatley and play passes to the next player. Neat idea and the glow in the dark aspect really puts it over the top. Excellent components too.

A dexterity game where players use a large wooden pawn to push a platter full of pieces.  Some of the pieces are cauldrons with your magical symbol on them, and the goal is to nudge all the pieces in order to drop one of your cauldrons into the "ring of light" in the centre of the board.  The huge hook to this game is once the board is set up, you turn out the lights and play in the dark!  Some of the pieces are luminescent, so you can see your symbols on the board, but nothing else.  You carefully nudge away until you hear the clatter of something falling off the platter, then it's turn over for you.  Barely a game, but for kids, or geeks who need something different, well worth a look!

A winner.  The play is different and the components are top notch.  Play is short, rules easy, play is fun, and the subject matter is right on for children.  I am impressed that the "charging" time is only 15-20 secs.  That means if you unpack the game under a bright light by the time you have set it up, it is ready to play.  This is an expensive game, and I am completely satisfied with it.

I really bought this game for one reason: glow-in-the-dark.  Fortunately, all the mechanics come together to make a satisfying game.  Great atmospherics and it is easy to teach and gets friends talking. There is no other game like Nacht de Magier. Ultimately, it's a highly random pushing game, but it's played for fun - not necessarily testing out your skills against others. Hell, it's played in the dark fer chrissakes!

Great concept! requires a very dark room. If you have children and or folks who just like unique games check it out. It currently isn't very easy or cheap to get it but worth it if you enjoy these kinds of games. pushing glow in the dark pieces around trying to get one of your into the center hole while not letting any other pieces fall off the platform. brilliant.  Just a little fiddly to set up and charge but no big deal.

This game glows like a charm and looks awesome. It can also be played in the light, but is surely a lot more fun in complete darkness. Game play is quick and everyone will want to play another game or more. It's just that fun. I'd highly recommend this to everyone.

I might even up my rating, after a few more plays.

Nacht der Magier is the only game in my collection that you're supposed to play in the dark. It's also peculiar as a dexterity game that requires no dexterity whatsoever - at least for those with at least one functioning hand and no propensity for seizures or narcolepsy. Nacht der Magier is something that everyone, adult and child, should try at least once if given the opportunity. It's a novelty, but you may find that it's also more than that. I'm sure that a quick game of Nacht der Magier will be the finishing touch to more than one game session around here.

This game is a glow in the dark game...  You are trying to move your piece into the center of the board...  in the dark...  but it has to be pretty dark (even a TV on is too much) or you can see what you are doing...  It's definitely a fun game and I will play it again...

Fun... once.

To have a little fun with the game: every time it's someone else's turn pick up and drop a piece on the table.  Because the game is played in pitch darkness, they'll think that they pushed a piece over and pass their turn.  You'll win every time!

Short enough to play a couple times in a row.  It's very atmospheric, since it's played in the dark with glow in the dark pieces.  Not too much skill involved, but then again I've only played a couple of times.  I suppose that with further plays, I'll see more possibilities.  Wouldn't want to play this all the time, but it's a nice change of pace when you want a quick filler.

A nice dex game, that can even be played with the glow in the dark components.  The goal is to guide your wizard by pushing your disc into the center without any of the pieces falling off the platform.  I think that the game should be played in normal light b/c there is actual skill & choices to be made.  The glow in the dark feature is rather nice but it is a bit more randomn like trying to find your way in a room that you're not sure of.

Construct the board, shine a light on the board to make it glow, turn out the lights, then use your personal piece to try and push one of your three pots into the shining ring.  If you make another wood piece fall to the table, your turn is over.  Novelty factor with glow in the dark dexterity.  Would never bother to play in the light.

Wow, truly magnificient bits in this game.  For the best experience, it should be played in the basement with all the lights turn off.  Many bits are phosphorescent, so we will see some details of the boards...but not everything.

Play well, even for us adults, because the drakness makes it equal for all participants.

Really, really neat components.  Maybe the best overall bits of a board game ever.  I'm not sure, though, that it's worth the price, as the games only take a few minutes and it's a little pricey for a kids game.  As far as gameplay, it strongly reminds me of those "Silver Falls" games where you drop in a coin and the bumpers shove all the coins around while you hope one falls into the payout chute.  I always liked those games, so this has a special place for me.

This game is a bit of a one trick pony.  There is a crowded board full of little wooden pucks, and you need to navigate your own puck though them without knocking anything off the board.  The pieces glow in the dark and you play with the lights off, so you can't see if you are about to push something of the board.  Very novel and unique, but the charm wears off quickly.

Game looks very cool when played in dark. Game itself is a really fast to play and is a lot of fun. It is something I want to play only when on a right mood (+ in pitchblack place preferably!).

Update (30.7.2008): The game works quite nicely as a dexterity game with kids in a bright daylight.

Beautiful (the components are absolutely top-notch), cunning dexterity game that can be as pleasant for adults as for children. If played by daylight it is a simple positional fight (each magician has got to get one of his cauldrons into the ring that lies under the "magic fire", that has to be pushed aside beforehand). If played in the dark Nacht der Magier becomes something entirely different, more fascinating and atmospheric: magicians, cauldrons, fire and ring glow, and silence is kept to hear the wooden pieces fall of the board signalling the end of each turn... it feels almost like a funny, little ceremony.

Playing in the dark adds the novelty bit to what's otherwise a pretty ordinary dexterity game. It's played in as absolute dark as you can get, with the player pieces glowing and all the blocking pieces invisible. Push your pusher, aiming to move one of your inner pieces into the centre hole of the board, but your turn stops as soon as something falls off the board edge as a result of your blind pushes. As you have no idea how exactly all the invisible blocks are now aligned, turns are just pushing in a roughly accurate direction and hoping you get lucky, providing little reward for playing. I want more than just novelty in a game.

In case you happen to have a dark room to play this in... I'd recommend to try.
Some pieces or parts of them glow in the dark and you try to navigate one of your pieces with them to the center of the circle. Whoever gets his piece first, wins.

If something falls, your turn is over. This is why I'd prefer that the circle had it's lines colored with that same phosphorous matter. Too bad that they isn't.

Probably will appeal for kids, it's just too bad that game can only be played in dark. It's a great invention, only a bit limiting.

This glow-in-the-dark dexterity game was a big hit. The idea is you have this platform with some glow in the dark pieces, and some not glow in the dark pieces, that are put in a sort of ring formation. You get a glowing player pawn you use to push into the platform from the outside edge. The goal is to get the glowing piece that matches your player pawn into the glowing ring in the center, but when a piece falls from the platform your turn is over. The pieces are nicely colored dark shades of blue, which makes it so you can sort of see them in the dark, but not perfectly. This creates a wonderful tension. The only fault is the game feels a little light, even for a dexterity game.

It glows in the dark!  Well, some of the pieces do.  And you are sliding your piece (magician's hat) around the board trying to get one of your glowing cauldrons into the glowing center.  But also on the board are non-glowing pieces that you can't really see.  Your turn ends should any piece fall off the board.  Simple concept with a gimmick.  Fun for a few plays or as a social game (only plays 4 though) until the gimmick gets stale.  (Can also be played in the light for a more tactical game.)  Rulebook is multi-lingual (including English), components are language neutral.

More of a trick game.  The first time you play with someone who does not know you play it in the dark is a lot of fun.  Once the laughing is over though it is a fairly basic dexterity game.

--Aug2006-- Very appealing light dexterity game.  What could be simpler than pushing a token into the center of a field?  Well, if there are a bunch of circular objects in the way, and your turn ends if any one of them falls off the field, things can become quite interesting.   My youngsters (4, 6, and 11) were quite amused, and my wife and I liked it too.  Excellent.

A very fun dexterity game played in the dark. The key is glow in the dark pieces. Great Halloweenish atmosphere.

RATING: 5
I really wanted to love this, but it's missing some important spark. I think the problem is that, in the dark, you can't see if a move is a huge risk or spectacularly skillful, so there's no suspense or tension. But if you play it with the lights on, the gimmick is gone, and it has to compete with all of the other dexterity games out there: pitchcar, crokinole etc.

This is a very easy to learn / play game that is surprisingly fun-packed.  It can be taught in about 2 minutes, and appeals to both adults and children.  Everyone I've taught it to wants to play it again immediately after their first game, which is easily done, since a game lasts only about 5 minutes.  The components are impeccably produced, giving an excellent all around game value.

A game that is certainly different from anything else that I own.  Aside from this, I have enjoyed playing it.  My girls have also enjoyed playing it, having asked for it numerous times.  Unforunately, it does not really get dark enough for them to play before bedtime during the summer.  Perhaps we will get around to playing again in the fall once it starts to get dark a little earlier.  At any rate, trying to push your cauldrons in the proper direction with limited visual references is a challenge in itself.  I know that I have found myself pushing in uninteded directions on multiples occasions.  [08/10/2007]

Nacht der Magier --
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Initial rating (yes we played 7 games in a row). 

The scenario: 3 grownups, tired, midnight. I had this charged while we played something more serious and then we tried this. Oh the simple and ridiculous joys of feeling like a kid while being a grown up. The best thing about the game is probably how it enhances your senses, primarily hearing, but also (obviously) seeing. The second best thing is the game's absolute charm while you race your little wizards with shiny pointy hats around dark tower (?) and stuff keeps falling to the ground. And thirdly there's more to the game that it seems - being smart (I won't say strategic) helps. You must understand everything has a chain effect - 2 players having a tug of war will help the 3rd person win; if you're emptying a certain area, you're helping people directly opposite to you and so on.

RATING: 6
Fun as a one-off but the basic mechanic (pushing) doesn't really bear repeated visits.

RATING: 5
Erm, I find it hard to think of this as a game. The gimmick is neat: played in the dark, you are a wizard trying to use your wooden pawn to push pieces so that one of your 3 cauldrons makes it to the centre. Your cauldrons and wizard pieces are glow in the dark. Your cauldron is also surrounded by other non-glowing wooden pieces and your turn ends when a piece falls off the elevated board.

The gimmick and dexterity element is far overshadowed by the fact that it cannot sustain repeated plays or interest. Games last for only 5 minutes and with kids and their poor attention spans, this one is strictly a filler, albeit an expensive one.

I also find it alarming that people play the game in daylight and love it. That's not how it's meant to be played. Played in daylight, it startg bogging down with 'perfect' information as people can see where the pieces and other cauldrons are and enagage in a tug-of-war.

This game is supposed to be played with kids. They are the centre of attention. Rate the game watching their expressions. The simplicity of the concept is a 10. Start rating games based on the purpose of the game. If the games involves kids watch them interact with the game and rate it accordingly.

This is a 9 for adults, for a quick and interesting dexterity game unlike any other dexterity games that might be in your collection.

It is a 10 for kids--around ages 5+ seems to be near perfect.  The combination of playing in the dark, with a game where they are on at least equal footing is unbeatable.

Depending on where your game table is, you'll find the first game is played pretty much "in the dark" and you'll have little knowledge of where the pieces are.  But after you've played once, your eyes will more quickly adjust to the dark and will be able to see the general shapes.  Undoubtedly kids' eye will adjust even quicker and will give them some advantage (though not a truly unbalancing amount).

RATING: 7
Quite the charmer!  Here you are pushing little disks around on a board covered with disks, most of which are invisible because you're in the dark!  And in the first place this is kind of like herding kittens, because a circle pushing a circle pushing a circle gives you chaos of the finest mathematical type.  Definitely a fun game to play for the first time, and since there'll always be new players you can show it to for the first time (until people just stop having kids altogether), there'll always be an audience ready to have fun with it.  I noticed that a lot of the adults in the room when I got a chance to play had already played it more than once and were even willing to stand around and watch while the newbies gave it a go, so it seems that its charm can even be expected to last a bit longer than the sheer novelty value.

RATING: 6
[Drei Magier Spiele 2005 edition] {Fantasy, filler, kid; dark, dexterity} {Adult 6, Children 8} Nacht der Magier is an interesting and attractive game. Players have to move their magician on the board so that their cauldron can land in the ring of light (the center of the board). It's more fun to play in the dark. It's one of the few games that should be played in complete darkness.

The concept is easy to understand. The theme is weak. Children do not have problem in understanding the rules. A typical game takes around 15 minutes. So, it can be several times in the night after dinner. 

The components are nicely made and illustrated. The graphics are cute and can be easily recognized.

A great game for the family!  We've only played with the lights on, but it is fast and fun, and keeps the attention of all of us, including the Mrs. and the 3 kids (6, 7, and 10).  With the lights off works too, but it's a less strategic game, as you really can't see what's going on.

As kids have gotten older, this one hasn't come out as often.

This family game is really unique.  Player must gently push their wizards and guide their pieces towards the centre of the board, trying to block each other and not knock discs off the board.  Its very fun - and the neatest thing is that the game can be played completely in the dark (glow in the dark pieces need to be 'charged up' first).  Excellent, beautifully crafted game pieces, great for children, and lots of fun.

Very unique game that is meant to be played in the dark.  It is very simple and is excellent for play with even young children.

This game looks great fully setup, glowing in the dark. However, a dexterity game played in the dark is just dull as could be. Thanks to having a little 3 1/2 year old daughter, who didn't want to play in the dark, I've found that gameplay vastly improves when you can see what's happening to the board as you're moving your wizard across it. I'm upping my rating a bit. There's still a bit too much setup for such a short game.

Edit: Eh, it's just not fun.

A true one of a kind gaming experience.  The darkened setting combined with the glow in the dark pieces really do make this an unique dexterity title that is both a feast for the eyes as well as for the ears.  A fun selection of kids and family.  For me, unfortunately, Nacht der Magier is only a one hit wonder.  I just don't see myself needing to play this again unless I'm entertaining younger audiences (or if I feel the need to "impress" non-gamers with a creative boardgame).

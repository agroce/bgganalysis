A clever spin on trivia games. Betting on your own "knowledge"/guesses or others'... Or against them!

Not often in the mood for trivia, but this was a fun change of pace for me.

It's a trivia game, so it will get knocked down by me just because of personal taste.  There are some interesting mechanics to bluff and hedge bets against various players by betting against exact or adjacent matches.

Good euro take on a trivia game. The only gripe I have with it is keeping track of what cubes are lost while other ones are replenished is kinda convoluted for what is only a difference of a cube or two at max from round to round.

RATING: 6.5
Enjoyable trivia game that simultaneously adds to and streamlines the system of its predecessors, Fauna and Terra. Do you know exactly when the corn dog was invented? Great! Do you know approximately in which state the first Subway opened? Also good. Have a guess as to how many Walkers were killed in the first four seasons of the Walking Dead? You might just get lucky. Fun twist on trivia that takes out the pressure of HAVING TO KNOW.

Right up there with Wits & Wagers when it comes to betting/wagering games with a trivia element. To win, you're probably going to need to know some trivia/facts, but even when you know absolutely nothing, you can still place reasonable bets based on what you see other people doing, since being "close enough" without being correct still scores you points.

I also knew I'd probably like this one since I also enjoy its predecessors, Fauna and Terra, although this may be the most enjoyable of the lot due to the nice variety of topics, ranging from pop culture, to landmarks, to historical events.

A particularly great game to bust out with non-gamers, as it still has that familiar trivia element they're accustomed to from many popular mass market games, but delivered in a format that gamers can really enjoy.

RATING: 5
A *terrible* selection of topics...we were joking that perhaps they had sold spots in the game to various companies, since so many were the subjects of questions. Even locations were often unknown to everyone playing. A game where you are unlikely to know the answers should still have subjects that are interesting in some way. I felt Terra was far superior in its choice of topics.

Really liked the game, but probably my least favorite so far of the 3 games that utilize this system (Fauna, Terra, America). Still a great trivia party game, and I appreciate the addition of a "No Exact Answer" option if you think no one has the answer correct.

RATING: 7
From most-liked to least-liked, my order is: Terra, Fauna, America. The cards in the latter game feature too many subjects that just do not interest me. I'll take animals or landmarks over pop culture any day.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
America is a decent trivia game in the vein of Wits & Wagers. The betting is more tactical, but the way the questions are asked sort of sucks. Guessing an unknown numeric value (as in Wits & Wagers and 2/3 of this game) at least allows a player to give an answer on some logical deduction, but guessing the state an object was invented is frustrating as you have almost nothing to go on. After awhile, it gets tiring having no direction and making bets on not knowing an answer (the game has areas to bet against players knowing the answer), and this gets old quick.

The game works, and I would play it again, but it never felt like players were in control of their destiny as they just hoped to make more lucky guesses.

I like this game as trivia games go--seems to balance a wide range of "expertieses" pretty well, and everybody has a chance to win.  Some interesting strategic decisions to make also--not just who is the smartest.  But only a once-in-a-while game for me.  My interests are in heavier games.

RATING: 8
The rules are pretty simple so we just went through them together. It's a trivia game about America, but you don't necessarily need to know anything about America to do well. Each round there are three questions with the same topic, one question has a date for an answer, one has a state for an answer, and one has a numerical answer. There is a year track for the date, a map of the US for the state, and a track of numbers for the numerical answer. Each of these also has a "no exact answers" box and a "no exact or adjacent to exact answer" box. Players take turns placing out cubes on the various tracks.

If you get something exactly right you get 7 points, if you're adjacent to the correct answer you get 3 points. If you choose "no exact answer" and there isn't one you get 3, if you choose "no exact or adjacent to exact answer" and there isn't one you get 7 points. So knowing that no one knows is good too. You retrieve all cubes that scored points plus one more. You play a fixed number of rounds and then declare a winner. 

I really liked this game. Even though I don't know much about America it was still fun. I'll have to check out the differences with Terra and Fauna and add one of these games to my collection for casual/party game nights.

This trivia game where "close counts" is sure to win back people who were frightened away by Trivial Pursuit.  It plays relatively fast, has a quick setup, seats up to 6 players, and is a quick teach.  It is always a fun game to play with America-themed topics.  I'd like to see some expansion cards at some point!

A few minor gripes...there are at least a few typos on the cards (one card in particular says the answer is east of the mississippi, but the right answer ended up being west).  Also, there are other questions on the back of each card, so between rounds you will want to be careful to not show answers when moving the cards around.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Fun trivia game.  I think I like this a little more than Wits & Wagers, but it's close.  The games are similar and I'd happily play either one.  I think I'd say the questions are a little easier than W&W.  Most of the state questions, someone knew the exact answer.  I dislike having the hint of which side of the Mississippi River the answer falls, as I think it's already too easy.  One thing we did that really improved the game for us was to just give every person/team four cubes every category.  There are some rules about how many cubes you get base on your results that seem entirely pointless and unnecessary.

America is a trivia game where you have topic with a year related question, a state question, and a numeric question. Each player goes around better what the answer to each question is, and you get 7 points for being right and 3 for being adjacent. 

I wasn't a huge fan of this game. The answers either felt SUPER obvious or impossible to know. There wasn't much middle ground. I think I won by a lot after a few rounds because I correctly utilized the "No one is right." answers several times.

2 out of my first 3 games were played with someone that knows a lot of general facts.  NOT fun to play with someone like that.  It's not even a contest.  They're able to make a lot more educated guesses, if they don't know the answer outright.  I think the last game was the worst since we also played with someone that likes to be argue any chance he can - real or fake arguments, doesn't matter.  Made the game longer than necessary since he'd question the trivia expert at every move.  Not the game's fault, but also played a role in my lack of enjoyment.  Will play this a few more times without either person, but it likely won't be at the top of the party game pile.

Good twist on the trivia game - really like the different "avenues" to tackle a topic (year, location, and number).  The cube system provides nice multiple paths to gaining points especially if you're not exactly sure of the answer.  I do wonder how many repeated plays this will allow for and hope there are plans for expansion packs in the future!

In the same vein as Fauna, but more enjoyable for me as I feel that my guesses are more educated. Also, I like the option of betting on no one correctly guessing the answer.

That said, the "betting against everyone" option is a bit too strong in a three-player game due to the small amount of cubes in play. Those six spots should likely be limited to one per player per round.

Tough to locate in the BGG Database, I hope they fix that. Very much like the game [thing=153507][/thing] but with history and media from America only. Crazy trivia game with unique categories such as Milky Way Chocolate Bar, Walking Dead, IBM, and you get the standard History questions as well! I think my family will love it! Very excited to own this game now. It is a lot of fun. You don't have to know a lot to do well in this game- half of the enjoyment!

RATING: 7
Pros:
1. Trivia game where even if you don't know much you can compete.
2. Being close is only for horseshoes and hand grenades and.... the board game America. Close answers get you points.
3. There is actual strategy in this game.
4. Plays extremely fast.

Cons:
1. Depending on which state is the answer, a player could get screwed out of easy points just because of turn order, but this is minimal.
2. I've now discovered at least 2 cards that had wrong answers. This caused some arguments of which we should use, the correct answer or what's on the card. I had to house rule that the true correct answer is what should be used.

Summary: A fun light trivia game. For the family members who love Trivial Pursuit, I play this game. This allows me to at least compete with those Trivia nerds. It's a super fast game that allows for flexible starts and stops.

Fun party game for family and friends.  This is a trivia game you can play with anyone because nobody will really know the answers - you'll all be guessing.  Nobody likes playing trivia games with that know-it-all asshole (unless you are the asshole).  This game sorta fixes the asshole problem!

Can't go wrong with this one.  I'd like to see a version of this for other countries.  Some really interesting "facts".

We absolutely love this game. In looking for a trivia game that was a bit different from Trivial Pursuit, but that is still high quality and rewards actual trivia knowledge (while pulling in a few other fun elements for the whole group), we've tried out many different trivia games as of late. This one takes the cake.

We looked at Fauna and Terra before purchasing this one, but we liked that America seemed to have a mix of US history, pop culture, and general knowledge, which was the right fit for our group. Given how much we liked this game though, we now may go back and try out Fauna and Terra as well, as apparently the game play is somewhat similar.

Pros:
-I'm a sucker for a high quality box / board - this game definitely delivered on that front. The game itself is sturdy and seems to be high quality.
-The no exact / adjacent spaces add a unique element to the game, such that this becomes not just a game of pure trivia knowledge (though trivia knowledge does help!), but also a game of strategy
-The cards themselves are super fun (I personally love that there are some fun pop culture ones thrown in there!), and I like that there is a mix of things that someone at the table usually knows, as well as things that are possible to take a semi-educated guess at, but tough to know for sure

Cons:
-A few rule tweaks were needed, e.g. since order comes into play a lot in this game, we wanted to allow every player to have the same amount of turns in each position. So, if we are playing with 4 people, we will do a total of 8 rounds (instead of 6, which is what the rules officially say), so that everyone gets a chance in each position.
-The order of players definitely becomes a factor in the game, so we also added the house rule of drawing before the start of each game to determine who sits where (maybe we are too competitive, but we have one trivia buff in our group, and it is definitely to an advantage to be the one who sits right after this person, as there tends to be significant piggy-backing opportunity after he plays...)
-There are a good number of cards here, but I would love a few more (just because we love this game so much, that I know we will be through them within a few weeks). Expansion pack maybe?? ;)

All in all, this game was a huge hit in our family, and one of the best new games we've discovered in months.

RATING: 7.5
Good twist on wits and wagers. The benefit here is that players have multiple paths to bet on. So if they don't know the date question, they may be able to guess the location question.

The cube-resource-management thing feels odd for this game, and I don't think there's much benefit of it.

Eh... I do enjoy Terra, but this version is just far worse. The only improvement is the "No Exact" and "No Exact or Adjacent" rule which can be house ruled into Terra. The main issue, outside of the less interesting map, is that the questions are so random. Some are amazingly interesting, but most are super boring and just silly things that could even be open to interpretation. And some questions are just stupid, like "Minimum number of players to play tag." Like what kind of question is that?

A trivia game in which the answers will a range of years, numbers or states, all related to the United States of America. Players choose which of three related questions they wish to answer, with play continuing until all players pass or run out of action cubes (which are used to place answers). The twist here is that adjacent answers (states contiguous to the correct state, a range of years one space away from the correct range, etc.) will also score points. Everything here works, but I found the questions to be very erratic, ranging from the obscurely difficult to the overly simple.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fauna is a fantastic game, so I was excited to give this a try. I haven't played Terra as I'm not interested in geography so I have no idea how that one compares.

I really like the few updates they made to the system here. Now there is a "no exact/adjacent" spot that you can place on if you think that none of your opponents have the right answer. Each answer is worth a set number of points instead of the variable amount of points that Fauna uses. The new "pick one of two cards" aspect is nice, as it gives you more of a chance to pick something you might be knowledgeable about. And finally you just play through six cards and the game ends, instead of waiting until someone crosses a certain points threshold.

Overall I really like the game and the updates to the Fauna system. My only real issue is with the price. There are the cards, a few cubes, and the board. When you open the mostly empty box you realize that there is no way this should have an MSRP of $45. Luckily the online price of about $29 is more reasonable and that's about what I would expect to pay.

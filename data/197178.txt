Out of all the pocket "Pack-O-Games", this is the best (and subsequently, the only one I've held onto). The mechanics are simple enough that my then 4-year old could grasp it, but tactical enough that my wife and I like playing it from time to time. Add in its extreme portability, and you have a game that everyone should have stashed in a purse or travel bag or backpack.

The pack-o-games series includes 3 levels of games.  Level 3 are the think-y-est while level 1 are the most casual.  This is a level 1 game and a pretty nice one at that.  It's not going to wow any serious gamers, but it is a great intro or kids game and shows promise for more devious game play.  The theme is well linked to the play, if not to the overall story of the game.  A good option for Daddy-Daughter games when time is short and fun is in demand.

I love the commodity speculation element, and it's that part which sets DIG off from the other Pack-O-Game games for me. I have trouble remembering that cards near the end will often move, and I always miscalculate how soon the game ends. Both add an element of frustration that make me want to come back to it.

Not horrible, but not great. 

This size card does not lend itself to easy manipulation and that seems to be a reoccurring theme in this set.

2017-11-21 : First play. Does what it says on the tin : a game that plays in 10 minutes and has some good moments and decision making. A good design given the obvious production limitations, but not something you want to play twice in a row

This is a kids game and it is a fantastic one. I doubt that would break this out with adults, but it is a go to game with kids. The art is great and the rules are so easy to teach. It is simple enough that my four year old can play it.

DIG is a pick-up-and-deliver game that is like a lighter version of BUS from the first Pack O' Game set.  This will seat up to 4 players and has this interesting idea going on that involves "sniffing" for certain colors of bones that you will then drop into the same-colored dog bowl.  What's interesting is you will see a card with two "scents" on it (red and yellow for example) but when you take it into your hand, only one bone will be there (either a red or yellow). 

So you're making decisions around efficiency, as in how far it will be to drop that bone into a bowl.  As with all the Pack O' Games, there's more going on here than at first glance when it comes to scoring. At the end of the game, all that is left will be dog bowls of various colors that will score your bones based on the proximity of the bowls to the dog house.  Fun!

FIRST IMPRESSION:

I rarely find these tiny games are something interesting and this proved to be along those same lines. These games never feel fully fleshed out from a development perspective and as a gamer I get frustrated when I notice limitations to certain colors scoring and the game will never allow that color(s) a way to finish with a higher value. At least its over quickly. It is super light and not for me.

As silly as this game is, it hits the table fairly frequently. It's cute, it's simple, it's strategic. It is fun. I do enjoy the game gym more. I think we also play rum more. Just the same if I were going to suggest some of these small games I would suggest this one again.

Pretty simple game of action allowance and set collection, but I found myself really enjoying it. The trade-off between carrying a bunch of bones and your movement speed is interesting, and I like how the yard adapts to what cards are taken. Very fun for what it is.

This game has been one of the first games out of my bag when introducing new people to gaming in ten minutes.  I have used it in the classroom and with my six year old niece.  The game is simple enough, but offers a fun guessing game if you put the time in to think about it.  Overall rating: 7  Ten Minute time frame rating: 9

Adorable doggy game. You are trying to collect bones and deliver them to the same colored bowl. Really cute and easy to teach and play. Not one I will play a lot since I don't like how the scoring works so much. I would definitely play again though.

My kids love dogs and this game seemed simple enough for a 5 year old. Glad to have it! You lay out all the cards, so it is not good for things like the car... waiting between pickups... but it is good for when the kids need some fun at the table, or in a hotel room (at the table). ... Any low traffic clean table would do...

This is a cute, quick-playing set collection game with a clever movement mechanism, much more interesting than we thought after getting through the rules! Super fast, too (10-15 min?)!

Summary
There’s a doghouse at one end of a long string of cards (mostly face down bones, plus 5 colored bowls matching the bones). Everyone’s dog starts at the doghouse. On your turn you get 3 actions:
- Move: up to 4-x spaces (x = number of bones in your hand)
- Dig: take the card into your hand; optionally, may return a card to that same spot (max hand size = 3 at end of turn)
- Drop: if at a bowl matching bone(s) in your hand, may drop them into your personal play area.
At the end of your turn, fill in gaps by moving card(s) from the end of the row to the empty spot(s).

The game ends at the end of the round when only colored bowls remain in display. Then, bones in your display are worth VP according to bowl position (5/4/3/2/1, closer to doghouse worth most). Most VP wins. Tiebreaker = most bones of highest value.

A tiny game of being dogs digging up bones.

2-4 players.
Difficulty: Beginner
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Cute micro-game with a mix of commodity speculation and pick-up-and-deliver. Cards are laid out in a row with a doghouse at one end. Players more up and down the row, digging up bones and dropping them in the matching-coloured bowls. The novelty is that the final card in each row is moved up to fill in the gap that digging leaves, and bones score at game end based on the ordering of the bowls next to the doghouse. In practice there is very little control; some colours can effectively never score high, and the semi-random digging makes it a crapshoot which a player will get anyway.

The movement (dogs get weighed down by bones) and pick-up-and-deliver are reminiscent of the vastly superior Deep Sea Adventure, the scoring of the similarly better Big Points.

Fun little game! Brilliant how the designer manages to put so much game into a concept of about 30 gum-sized cards! This one is a rather tactical game where you really have to keep an eye on what bones your opponents are collecting. You might want to join there quest or do the opposite and try to put their bowl at the end of the row buy taking bones at very specific places.

RATING: 9
2-player face-to-face blind bidding = a recipe for intensity. I love it.

Too many games end with someone saying "Okay, now what do we play next?". But not Shazamm!. The more games you play, the better it gets - and it starts pretty good in the first place...

RATING: 5.9
Pretty in depth 1v1 bluffing game.  Both players have to decide (secretly) how much mana to bid and which cards to play, which either increase, decrease, double, or nullify etc. yours or your oppents bids.  Lots of stress as you try to figure out what the opponent will bid, and what to bid yourself.  After each bid, the fire wall moves towards the loser.  (you only have 50 total to bid each round).  If you think your opponent will bid high, you can just bid 1 and then their mana pool will be low for the next bid.  But if you can beat their bid by 1, you get a good win while the mana remains equal for both players.

RATING: 6
A nearly game for me.  I like this kind of two-player duel in which you try to out guess your opponent.  I like the way you can choose to conserve mana or cards, hoping for a decisive advantage, or spend freely, pressing for a quick win.  

My problem is with the spell cards.  Each player has an identical deck of 15 spells.  Some have powerful effects on the outcome of a turn.  Late in a longer game, card counters can figure out what their opponent has left and plan accordingly. At other times, the cards can dominate play and the feel is very chaotic.  

I kind of like the bright colours and bold artwork in the Z-Man edition. Production quality is good.

After selling Dungeon Twister (See its game comments for reasons why) I think Shazamm! has now filled that void for me. While they aren't too similar, they are both two player duels. What Shazamm! lacks in depth it more than makes up for in play time and ease of play.

More to come...

A great theme, implemented with even greater style (very nice components). However, once you get past all the chrome, the game engine underneath it all is not that impressive.

The blind bidding system has been done over and over again. Usually, it does have some interesting additional mechanics, but not here. This is as plain as it gets.

The only redeeming aspect is the use of certain spell cards. But a bluffing element, added to yet another one, make for a very chaotic game where you have absolutely no control.

Again, great theme and very nice components. Those are the only things that could make me play it again (and the only reason why this game's rating isn't lower).

UPDATE [2009-12-02]: After playing several times with the awesome o_cedar, I've learned some subtleties that weren't apparent in my first plays. While the game is still not of my favorite type, it does what it does in a great way, and it's very fun. Especially when you learn how to anticipate some of your opponents reactions.

This is definitely not a game you'll enjoy the first couple of times, but one that will slowly grow on you.

This game has a funny sort of rhythm to it, you can end rounds quickly by spending a lot of Mana, you can also fight long battles, making the round quite long.  The cards add a lot of extra powers to the mix.  A fun little game - I like it quite a bit.

This is a fine and quick two player game. Mechanics are not that original or elaborate, but everything works quite well. The only issue is that the game is HIGHLY over-priced, and for the same amount of money I can think of about 20 better 2 players games around... As it is, it is a well conceived and fun game, and I'd like to recommend it to every gaming couple. :)

Long for what it is, and repetitive.  It's a novel concept, but it ain't my bag, man.  I'm willing to try it again and have recently picked up a copy.  Will revise then if needed.

I like it a little better.  I think this game will benefit from repeated play.  I'm not sure I'll get that opportunity, but I think it's worth keeping around.. and a decent 2p filler to be played when waiting around for a larger group to finish up at a game night.

[u]October 2008:[/u] I was a bit worried after I bought this one, but I really have tons of fun with my girlfriend when I play this one. I've actually LAUGHED while playing! God knows I'm not a big laugher, specially when it comes to games where I prefer to think.

[u]May 2009:[/u] Ok, so I played with another of my friends, Bassem, which is the most competitive player of our group, which hates when even a wee little bit of luck os present and whose midle name is AP... I would never have thought he would like this game but there you go, after the first game, he requested another one, and the next time he came, this is the game he requested... He really loved it! Actually, I really like this game too, I upgraded the rating to 8.

One of the truly great two player games. Sure there is a lot of chaos, but less than in poker IMO. I think of it as a bit like poker, only that you can say when you have the 'good' hands, but can also change the variant of poker. Enough there to really get the adrenaline going.

I think this is a fun 2P game. I like to play it during lunch at work. Its a game of trying to outguess your opponent as to what they might play against you.  Both my opponent and I get the same cards but at various times due to shuffling, so I never know what is the right card to play to get the turn/round won. This is defenitly in the light catagory. For a 30 minute game I think it is a worthy game .

Beautiful components, art, and graphic design, in a nice small box, a great 2 player package.  The gameplay is simple but involves a lot of double-guessing, bluffing, and clever play.

Interesting bluff game that reminds me of the card mechanic in LotR: Confrontation and Dungeon Twister. You know what cards your opponent can play, especially late in the round, but he knows that you know that he knows... Text point size on the cards is a real drag for my fading eyes, but everything is duplicated in the manual at a readable size and familiarity will make this less of an issue. The youngest knew each cards ability after one round and thoroughly trashed me in the first game -- usually a sign of an instant hit with him, but not this time. He rates it a six also, but couldn't be talked into another game.

RATING: 5
This is what Lord of the Rings: The Duel should have been.  I would ignore the basic rules and jump into the variant that has each character start with their full deck of cards which would make this a luckless card dueling game of doublethink.  It's a pretty easy game to learn, it's not overly expensive and it's also has pretty nice components, even if they looked designed more for kids and youngins' than adults.  Not sure how well it will stand the test of time, but for now it's a nice distraction.

If you enjoy games with blind bidding and bluffing like Lord of the Rings The Confrontation, and don't mind a fantasy theme, Shazamm! offers a good quality two player duel that will be best enjoyed with repeated play.  
It's a real [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/21212]battle of wits[/url]!  Somewhat geared to a very limited niche of players because of the theme and the blind bidding/bluffing style of play (RPS mind games, combined with resource/card management).  I love it, but I can see why others don't.  Thanks JT!

RATING: 7.5
Shazamm! is a neat little 2player duel. It's a straight fight, aggressive, attacking, until one of you falls into the lava below. But by using your spell cards, and a certain amount of guile, you can push the wall of flame onto your opponent and win the day. The card play seems complicated at first, but really, the results are obvious and since you only use a few cards at a time, it's easy to pick up (very language dependent though).

I enjoyed playing Shazaam!, and it was odd to play this the day after playing Times Square, also a 2player duel, but in which you pull people towards you. I liked the graphic design in Shazamm! too, a little different to the moderate German designs. The French have a flair to their work. I'll play this again, but I wonder how attractive it will be to opponents.

Reminds me a little of the 2-player battle, tug-of-war game, Lord of the Rings: The Duel.  The battle mechanics are very different except that they both have text cards which modify battles.

A lot comes down to guessing, which I generally dislike, but there is some good fun to be had. Things get more interesting toward the end, when you can plan your moves based on the knowledge of which spells your opponent has already cast. I also like the theme, which was probably inspired by the confrontation between Gandalf and the Balrog, but it also reminds me of the magic duel between Vincent Price and Boris Karloff in "The Raven". The game seems to get old fast, though, and after about a dozen plays, my desire to play again has diminished considerably.

Hand management:Bluffing:Variable powers:

Pretty cool 2 player game that is nicley themed and comes with nice components, reminds me a little like playing Magic with only 2 with all the back and forth and Mana and such. 

Much more interesting than En Garde with all the special powers and double-thinking going on. More strategy than meets the eye and an interesting little battle takes place once the Silence spell is cast which really drives up the bluffing and double-guessing but timed properly gives the person in the lead the advantage. There is a nice built in timer with the bridge shrinking every round which also serves to keep the tension up.

Very well thought out spells and a clever little game, not sure how long it will last with me though. Also not sure which variant is best, while normally I want to reduce luck if possible we played with all cards in hand and I'm not sure thats best. Will try a hand of 5 cards and see how that plays but anyone worried about not enough control can just play with all cards in hand.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (December 2014)

At last I got to play Shazamm! face to face. I was pleasantly surprised as I enjoyed it a lot. After reading the rules I thought the game was going to be very boring and random, but the bluffing and double guessing are very interesting and fun. It is very easy to teach and it plays around 30 minutes. The game components are well done. The art is also great. Love the funny theme (battling wizards over a lava bridge).

There is some “luck of the draw” in the way the spells are drawn but I feel the better player will win more often than not so it doesn’t bother me. However I’m keen on trying the expert variant in which each wizard begins with the full complement of spells available, this way there is no luck at all in the cards so I think I will really like it.  

Bottom line, I enjoy the game. I want to play it again soon and  I plan to keep the game for now.

As far as "Duel" type games go, this is better than most I've played, but ultimately isn't very interesting. There are many more two-player games I'd rather spend my time on. I find I'm just not a fan of games where you play cards to push the other player backwards. The whole idea is "meh". If you enjoy those sorts of games, then you shouldn't listen to me on this one. But I'll pass.

I like the wagering part of the game.  The theme/artwork is enough to turn me away, but I'm always looking for a new 2-player experience.  I like the idea of this one, and the previously mentioned wagering makes it feel unique.  I have the feeling that I need to play this one a few more times in order to begin to understand.  I predict that my rating will go up with more play.

Like the rating said, extremely annoying game. The concept is simple and the card should add variety top the game. But Me and my girlfriend really hate this game becaus eyou need to calculate and think what your opponent is thinking. ("I am thinking that he is thinking that I am thinking that he is thinking ...")

So it's really hard to evaluate how much to bid because there are so much possibilities. Maybe if you could have a set of fixed numbers it would have been better because you have a more limited choice.

As both [gameid=18833] and [gameid=65334] are family favorites, Shazamm was a no brainer. Blind bidding, bluffing and tricky card combos, what could go wrong? I had a small concern about if my 6 y.o. could handle it at all, but he'd showed such finesse and stone-faced cruelty that I'd say it's perfectly fine for kids, the mechanic of the cardplay is easily teachable.

RATING: N/A
2 player game where you basically bid for the right to move a firewall toward the other opponent. When that happens, the hit player moves back two spaces, the aggressor moves forward two spaces, and the firewall is repositioned between the two.

There are some spell cards that also make it interesting. 

May work; does have some 'take that'; although it probably would work, it doesn't seem super interesting. The main draw is in outguessing your opponent.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
An ok 2-player duelling game where the players are selecting spells simultaneously and secretly choosing how much power (Mana) they will use to win each bout. 

The variable spell powers play a big part and bluffing/second guessing is also a major part of the play. 

Not a bad game but not enough to remain compelling beyond the 5th play or so.

2 player game with lots of "mind-reading" and bluffing tactics. Who's wizard will be the Last One Standing over the boiling lava. Got this before I got Epic Spell Wars. Since that one supports more players, we barely play this one anymore. I still like the mana track on this one, where you get to pick how powerful each spell is.

RATING: 6
It is a bidding game, where initially the bidding is blind. Renewable energy is used as bidding currency. Once usable cards may change the outcome of each bid. A succession of bids determines movement of two opposing wizards on a bridge. The winner pushes the other wizard off the bridge.
The game is pretty fast and enjoyable, but the randomness is definitely a con. Good for occasional play.

RATING: 10
Judging this game after 1 play does not mean anything even though I understand it's tough to keep playing if the first one fell flat...

Long term strategy, hand management, outguessing... this game is pure adrenaline, I love it...Those who say it is just a series of uneducated guesses have clearly failed to grasp the subtlety of this beauty which gets better and better the more you play (especially with the same opponent).
My win rates against newbies is close to 100% while my victory rates against other confirmed players (more than 100 games) is 70%! so I reject the theory of uncontrollability for this one!
This game is a gem really ! However, it is better to discover the game online first as the interface helps a lot to discover the strategies and understand better the rules...

Starting with the board version straight away can prove tricky and boring if both players don't get it quickly...
If after a few games, you still don't think much of the strategy aspect, try the quiz I uploaded here (http://www.boardgamegeek.com/file/info/27854), it could prove VERY challenging...

One of my very rare 10's. If you want to try this game online, feel free to challenge me on www.boiteajeux.net !
NB : though it may not seem so when beginning, the most strategic rule version is the standard one and not the variant with all cards in hand. All tournaments are played this way.

RATING: 6
A nicely constructed outguessing game, trying to "just" outbid the other player with each play, or massively underbid them. There is continual danger of your opponent's spell cards upsetting your plans, just as you plan to upset their plans with yours. Getting the spells and guesses right provide some nice inner-glow feelings, and some good groan factor. In the end though, I'm not a big fan of simultaneous revelations, as the reward is momentary and can be put down to good fortune over good management. But if I'm in the genre, this is a good one.

Great Z-Man presentation: slick, beautiful comic art and the bidding wheel looks cool. But interest halved even before the half way stage - the cards are too dominant, and the out-guessing and bluffing mechanic of the bidding wheel got too much. It did finish quickly, but when I'm playing a game and half hoping to lose that turn, it's never a good thing. Willing to play as a filler, but disappointed the cards dominate basic decision making.

This game is great.  Great components, cool theme, the whole nine yards.  Blind bidding, hand management, and spending your resources wisely while trying to outguess your opponent.

RATING: 9
This is a very clever and fun game. On first reading it seems a totally random guess-fest. In play, that is rarely the case: the interaction of the spells (more so the ones played and therefore out of the game) and board position set fairly stringent limits on what each player can do. The mana track is annoyingly small but otherwise the components are good. The mix of double-think and situation analysis is interesting, and gives a satisfying game. Against a player of similar ability, this game is an incredibly fun and rewarding way to spend half an hour... or more: make it a best of five series!

Initial plays might seem pseudo-random as the spells can seem arbitrary and the amount of mana quite high.  But with repeated play comes knowledge of the various combinations that can be used and how to use them.  The nice twist/challenge in the game - Cards will only be used once and you get them in a random order - starting with 5 and gaining 3 more after each round.  Part of the challenge is doing well with the cards you have.  Nice production value (thick tiles) for a small box game.

There are some solid ideas here.  This has a nice poker feel to this with some good bluffing.  I like the broken bridge pieces as a sand clock. This has a similar mechanism to Dune's fantastic battle system, with a dialed number of resources that you lose and a card to bluff that effects some of the conditions.  The problem is that there just isn't enough else to the game, so it is hard to get invested in the outcome.  In Dune, you can keep track of some of the cards people are using, here you only know what people no longer have.  What you get is a double blind bluff.  There is definately a game here, but most of the time I felt I was struggling for any control.  It seems the proper way to play is card count and number crunch the 50 magic points then hope that you don't get skinned by the numbers.  This is a little too much work for me.

Great game and unlike anything else I've played.  Spells and counter-spells, combining bluffing and (nested) logic.  Just enough luck of the draw (which shapes which spells are available to each player at any given time) to keep every game a fresh one.  (And there's a luck-free variant if that's important to you.)  The spells themselves are clever (yet not too complicated) and they seem to have been well-constructed.  Lots of ju-jitsu effects.

It's a two-player game and, thus far, published only in French.  But translations of the rules and cards are available online and the numbers/graphics on the cards make it easy for non-French speakers to play.

My 7.5 year old daughter, a Harry Potter fan, is enthralled by this game.

An interesting game that plays quickly & with simple streamlined rules. Having the same deck of spells means we (my wife & I) have to think carefully about each play.

I had a blast playing this one!  I find myself liking games involving special action cards much more than I expected, such as Hera and Zeus and Scarab Lords, so maybe I shouldn't be surprised.  The timing of how much mana to wager and which cards to play makes for a most excellent two player game.

[Asmodée French (2003) edition] {Fantasy fighting, couple; bluffing} Shazamm! is a decent 2p/couple game. It's full of fun and player interaction. It is very thematic - the system, board and cards integrate well in the fantasy world. It's very exciting when you find yourself one step in front of the broken bridge flagstone and the fight for your life.

The bits are attractive and sturdy. However, the game comes with no inset and the dialer may damage the card/board.

The game rules are quite clear with a minor ambiguity - when do you cut off your mana reserve. I play it with the mana cut-off the final step in a round but I am told that mana shall be cut off first before spell cards are solved.

Shazamm! is balanced because each player has his own set of cards and both players have the same starting mana. Besides, the priority of the spell cards is nicely tuned. It's quite difficult for a losing player to come over; so it may not be wise to save spell cards for future rounds. One should try to win early rounds.

It's good to have a more tactical play but having all 14 cards in hand is a little bit clumsy and makes the game slower due to deep analyzing. It's also a double-guessing game. You can use a spell card to create an effect or cancel out your opponent's spell with the same spell card or higher-priority spell card! 

This is an excellent attempt for first-time designer.  Keep up the good work!

[Update] Good. Z-man is going to release the English edition. I am considering it even though I have the French edition. English text is quite important.

I kinda liked this outguess-your-opponent game. The cards are interesting and fit the souped-up rock-paper-scissors mechanics well. On the downside, I'm not as enamored of the artwork as some others seem to be, and the mana track is about as poorly designed as can be, to the point of being almost non-functional. I don't think I'll play this often, but I could see it hitting the table now and again. It's certainly far superior to the similarly themed Lord of the Rings: The Duel, which also features a bridge battle.

An excellent bluffing game. There are two levels: You bid from your mana pool, and the lower bidder gets pushed back. But you also may play magic cards that modify the mana comparison in different ways. The magic offers a lot of possibilities, but you can only play each one once per game. Having the threat of the card can be more powerful than playing it.

Take the game En Garde by Knizia and throw in action cards...well you got my attention and I'm excited. I like En Garde and I like games with action cards that bring chaos. Perfect fit right? 

Well this game certainly is a cool idea but the end product is a game that's kind of lame. The cards really do need to recycle more often than they do. I have to be honest I've not tried the "Advanced" rules where you have all 14 cards available at once and will so chances are good for the rating on this to go up. We'll just have to see.

A wizard is usually an angry and lonesome bad guy, both eager for power and drunk with it. When two wizards meet over a bridge (one of the old stone bridges over lava rivers which are commonplace in the wizard kingdom), you can bet none of them will let the other pass first, and it usually ends in a magic duel, full of fire and fury.
\13\\13\
So, YOU are one of the most powerful wizards in the wizard kingdom - but out there, just across that bridge over the lava river, is a wizard that insists on thinking HE is the mightiest wizard in the realm! The only thing left to do is have a duel. Your goal is to push the rival wizard back under your fire walls, balls and bolts so that he falls down into the lava lake. With careful management of your mana and your spellbook, it will be a piece of cake. Be careful, though - the bridge is collapsing under the fury of the magical duel.

Quick, but it doesn't seem to me that there is much of a game here.  It's really just a series of guesses, as each player has a ton of mana and plenty of cards.  It doesn't feel like there is much strategy - just outguessing your opponent.  Maybe the advanced variant, where you pick your spells rather than draw them randomly, would involve more strategy, but the game just isn't good enough to get that far . . .

Now and again, this game's pretty sweet.

I love the theme, the bluff and double-bluff aspect, the card combos.  Quite a good two-player game.  It's a shame it's not more widely known, as it needs to be.  Also too bad that it's not in the Kosmos 2-player line, as I see this as a perfect fit.

I think this game is fun and a nice filler but so far the couple people I'd played this with so far were not impressed. My one friend even went as far as comparing this to MtG. Which I don't really see the comparison other then two wizards dueling...but whatever.

Since I picked this up for $10, I'm not to upset over the purchase even if I'll hardly ever get to play it.

$5.  I like it, but no one else seems to.

An interesting blind-bidding game with special powers thrown in for flavor. In fact, if it didn't have the special power cards there would be very little game here. Attempting to figure out when and how to play out your cards, when to use all your forces and when to use caution, therein lies the game.

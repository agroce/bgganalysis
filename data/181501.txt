After reading the reviews, I wasn't so sure about this, but I ended up being pleasantly surprised!  It's got so much of the flavor of the base game--my GOTY a few years back--in such a small package.  Not too much shorter...or really any more simplified, but seems like it's a good design.  I'll consider picking it up, but I wish it was a little more different.

I owned peloponnes board game with the sanctum expansion in the past. I actually liked the card game more than the board game. I find it is a more polished version of the board game and that it fixes most of its issues. The board game seemed kinda broken in my playgroup with the easiness of acquiring vessels and with the way to go strategy of getting more and more civillians to be a little frustrating. In the card game both these problems are getting addressed.

RATING: 8.7
It captures the feel of Peloponnes, however it lasts shorter and feels more of a "travel edition" than a card game. Rules are almost the same. No innovations since the original. Liked it less than the original.

RATING: 7.8
Only played one sloppy rules learning game.  I have a feeling that it would go up with more plays.

RATING: 6
So similar to the original game but with an increased level of randomness that makes you wonder why the designer thought this version was necessary. Given the choice, play the original in preference every time. Seems overly chaotic, seems ultimately un-necessary with such mirrored features of the original.

RATING: 6
If you like punishing games (example: Agricola, Robinson Crusoe) and civilization games this is a very good choice. Sadly, I only like the second so really didn't enjoy this one. Tried it with 2 and 3 players, 3 is definitely better. If rated purely by enjoyment I would rate it a 4.

Pros:
- fast, plays in under an hour
- small box
- relativelly fast setup/teardown
- civilization / tablo building
- language independent

Cons:
- punishing
- art is so-so
- cards warped

So the Patronus Addon does some help against the random desasters. So it is the step in the right direction. And the 6th player is also welcome, there we often play in our well visited Boardgame Club. 
But iam still missing 4 to 5 player aid cards, that summarize the actions, phases & end turn proceeding.

:thumbsup: [b]POSITIVE POINTS:[/b]

++ Card game version of the game Peloponnes that capture almost all the feel of it's big brother board game, all in a small portable package and at a great price.
++ Good replayability from the different civilisation cards we get, the order of the different card drawn from the order/number of disasters to hit.
++ Relatively fast to set-up and relatively fast to play.


:thumbsdown: [b]NEGATIVE POINTS:[/b]

-- I don't have a sense of having build something great at the end of the game (it feel long for just a few card played).
-- Catastrophes sometimes hit really hard and it's sad to see the little we manage to build being destroyed.
-- The round phases are not intuitive (and a summary card for this could have been really helpful).
-- The card design is somewhat confusing at first.
-- The art is really so so. At least it's a style I don't like.

RATING: 4
A brutal card game that randomly punished you based on the card flop. You could defend against a particular catastrophe and it never come up, but another just hits you hard and fast and takes away your tableau. Playing with 5 was very slow and dragged the game on with lots of rules questions as for most of us it was our first play as the game did not seem very intuitive. Maybe another play would reveal some strategy but I felt like I did the easiest choice each round with little thought and still managed to win. I would consider trying it again with less players to see if it’s better but I’m not eager to play again as this game should play quick and it certainly does not.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Surprised at how much I am enjoying this. The theme is veneer-thin but still works for me. Balancing resource growth with building growth, keeping up with feeding your population as well as planning for natural disasters are all thrown in the mix to create a nice matrix of juggled concerns. I have multiple fronts to monitor and tend but in a streamlined, small footprint design. The solo game has been a pleasure.

Compared to the base game, this is faster, more elegantly streamlined, and overall a bit more fun to play for me. The only piece I miss from the original game is being able to collect resources each round for use. I also prefer this version's method for allowing you to plan for and deal with disasters and the fact that which ones will emerge is uncertain.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Playing with the solo variant. It plays surprisingly well, with difficult decisions about which card to buy each turn. The 'dummy player' builds up a score and presents a real challenge. Thumbs up from me! However, the rulebook was not easy to read and work out what was going on.

RATING: 2
This was billed as a less brutal version of the original game, but we found that it is extremely punishing. The fact that disasters wipe out your buildings means every time you get hit, you will be less resilient to the next negative thing. This game often snowballed on one of us and we lost pretty much everything. We originally bought it due to scarcity of the base game, but we will probably pick up the original game to get the feel we want without all the harshness.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Feels heavier, and oddly, less streamlined (specifically, how luxury goods are generated) than the board game version and the abundant card generation combined with multiple use cards creates some AP as you try to calculate the best way to generate points.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The card game stays close enough to the board game that you may wonder if you need both. I don't think so. There are a few changes for the better (disasters are a bit less calculable, resource handling has been simplified) but also some changes that are not improvements (disasters are a bit less calculable (yes), reduced space for maneuvering to avoid disasters), some design decisions are outright weird (population vs. grain cards).

All in all, however, the card game is close enough to the boatd game even in game length that there is no need for both. Unless the smaller form factor is a major selling point, I prefer the board game for the somewhat more open play.

RATING: 7.5
If you own the board game and have invested in and enjoy all the expansions and like the added flexibility of playing with more than five then this card game isn’t going to replace the original. If you do not have the board game then the card game makes an ideal cost and space effective introduction to Peloponnese in a handy sized box (the non-standard size of the original box still niggles me a little). The card game has the same great auction system and fluid, quick game play, indeed it has so many similarities with its older brother that I personally question the need to hold on to both. Which one I will keep I am still debating, but the added portability and streamlining means that at the moment I am leaning towards the card game.

Very nice streamlining of Bernd's hit, Peloponnes, but still has all the tension of that game. There are also improvements in some rules, such as with the disasters (not all of them are guaranteed to take place) and there is less fiddliness in having to adjust all the different tracks. My favorite Irongames release since PAX!

[microbadge=1714]

10-Sep-2016:  Overall, the card game version of Peloponnes wonderfully recreates the feel of the boardgame, keeping much of the same core structure of gameplay. There is more randomness with card draws, of course, but this is easily overlooked due to the fun, quick gameplay.  Also, so far, I feel the card game is a bit more forgiving than its predecessor.  

I feel like this game is already becoming a bit of an addiction. Thirty minutes or less of playtime. Enough thinky-ness to give the player a little brain burn. A simple AI system that seems to be reasonably competitive. Variety in the card draw, starting civ, and how to build your tableau for solid replay value. And five levels of difficulty for increasing challenge the better you get.

This is a clever game that takes a few playthroughs to appreciate. Does feel a little fiddly at first, but things make sense later. The only thing I do not like about it is how devastating and almost unavoidable the disasters are here. I almost feel like the game would be much better without them altogether as you do not have time to build enough anyway, yet half of what you have built is razed by the end. Nevertheless, it is definitely worth $20-25 as it gives you almost the same feeling as the original Peloponnes.

[b]Peloponnes Card Game[/b] was sold via auction 2/14/16. 

[i]The game play was fun, I really like how the bidding for cards worked, but the game is very random (even for a card game) and can be quite punishing. I did only play with two so maybe that is party why our games seemed to have such wild swings in them especially concerning the disasters. There is really no way to mitigate even half the disasters and you never know which one will trigger when. Two plagues come out? I'd better work on defending against that and next thing you know three droughts have come out back to back and your whole civ just tanked. I already sold it and I have no desire to ever play again.

2.當有災難卡上圓片到最後格則結算之後該災難卡棄掉，之後如果有任意一張卡中央有供給符號進入供給階段
*供給階段 每個卡右上人口要支付一個米(先用生產能力不夠用對應錢幣卡補)，所有有壓錢幣建築要馬上支付資源蓋好(全部所需資源加總)，不夠付可出手牌有人的符號或是移除建築或土地卡值到剛好
*當支付建築如果產能過剩(石頭木頭沒用掉的)，超過一個或的一個奢侈品，記錄在該卡上，供給階段不會拿，供給階段多的麥也會轉，奢侈品是百搭，也可用來換一比一抽錢卡
*災難 列表，特定卡牌下方可防止，如果上方收集到三個一樣有同樣防止效果，如果在發生後獲得防止效果，則遊戲最後可移除上面錢幣卡來計分
>地震 三分之一(向上取整)用你的錢幣蓋掉中間跟下半部，或是選擇移除
>雷雨 三分之一地景牌用錢幣蓋掉下面，也可選擇棄掉

4.照出價多少調整順位，最多的在最前面，平手相對順位不變
5.拿回標到的牌，競標金錢棄掉成棄牌區，建築卡放左邊形成一列，付不出資源的壓一張錢在下面，效果都正常(沒得壓又不付就棄掉)，地景卡放右邊
*支付資源時只能用你現在所有卡牌的右下生產能力，差值可用錢幣卡另外一面有的對應資源補足
6.收入階段 右上錢幣是一次性收入，所有人口總和查表是每回合收入，抽對應數量的錢卡
*第八輪收入完後進入最後一次供給階段，然後如果有防止特定災難可以除對應錢幣卡，加總所有建築跟地景奢侈卡還有錢卡上人口數，加總所有力量卡分數(卡片中央)，每6個錢卡跟奢侈品1分還有奢侈卡上的，人口跟力量分低的是分數，平手比另外一個，在平手比奢侈品總數
***SOLO****
*虛擬玩家起始一張文明卡跟奢侈卡，虛擬玩家在你拿完卡後拿另外一列最右邊的，如果是拿征服列額外再抽三元放置，最後正常算分，不受災難影響
*第一場隨機文明跟三元放奢侈卡旁圍起使資源(如果有人口不用餵)，在ABC三個時代你都有一回合可以買第二張牌(可用第一張蓋第二張)，第二張牌同時決定AI拿哪列
*之後每場都抽不同文明卡，但依次能買第二張牌的時代遞減
*第五場則只抽一張錢幣卡當起始資源

RATING: 9
"Awesome compact and streamlined re-implementation of the excellent Peloponnes game. It has the same great auctions, and many similarities, but has a more fluid, less tight feel. It replaces the full game for me, but I can see why it wouldn't for others."

What I like:
- Preserves the feeling of Peloponnes
- Gameplay is super smooth and streamlined
- Resource tracking is much simpler than Peloponnes
- LOVE the small box, and reasonable price

What I don't like:
- The rulebook is very small (with small type)

The card game adds several interesting decisions, such as which cards to discard as payment, how to try to avoid disasters, and when to build buildings just to gain luxury goods. 

The variant to delay disasters is OK for a learning game, but I definitely prefer the harshness of the rules as written. 

The Amun-Re-style auctions remain awesome, as does the quick pace of the game. There is no reason it doesn't work solo (just as Peloponnes did), and I would love to see expansions just to increase the player count beyond 5. 

If I loved the Peloponnes expansions, I might have kept that game. But when I can have a very similar experience in a box 1/4 the size, and half the price, the card game wins. Plus the new twists in the card game seem pretty interesting, and might even convince me this is the better game overall, regardless of size. 

I would put the weight a bit lower than BGG voters, at around 2.4.

This game is very similar to the board game. So till now I give it a very solid 8. I have to see if this is going to become my portable version of Peloponnes.

What a horrible implementation of the boardgame! This is a pure chaos fest, where the disasters are much harsher as they make you lose cards (as good as) and it's almost impossible to protect yourself! You need of the same symbol, but you buy at most 8 cards during the entire game!

Sat down at Essen to learn this nasty little card game. Apparently, it is very much like the board game- but I haven't played that. 

I am usually not a fan of games that beat you up. This was a nice auction game and very light civ aspect with it. There were some harsh consequences of the game and events that happened. 

It was fun to play 2p. I am interested to see how it plays with more. I liked it enough to buy it- so now I have to play it!

Seems just a little too similar to the original game for me to own both. (Can I really own too many games?) The original is in my collection because it plays up to eight players with the boards provided in the expansions. I prefer the idea of the portability of the card game though and would definitely be in after a player adding expansion, or if (like PAX) two decks could be combined for a game up to ten players.

Not sure why preorders outside the EU are paying the MwSt inclusive price? I'm all for people paying tax, but I hope in this case the 19% is going as a bonus to Iron Games and not to the government.

------------------------------------

The only interaction is through the auctions, but it's a tense and unpredictable ride through various calamities. Easy to follow once you get started and feels like there's a little more tension than the original game. The duel use money and resource cards are a nice addition to the mix. Good stuff. I especially like the portability of the small box.

I've heard Peloponnes is a great bidding game for two, and so the card game version seems like a great way to get that, but on the couch!

1 play, 3er

It still felt very much like what I (vaguely) remember of the original board game:
- civ theme
- cool, tough, once-around Evo style of auction (except that you can never change your bid value, only bid target)
- punishing disasters
But boy, it seemed difficult to protect yourself from those disasters, and they seemed to be pretty random/chaotic. Was it like that in the original game, too? I like a tough game, but I'm not overly fond of being slapped in the face repeatedly (and at random) -- one reason why, for example, I'm a bit less fond of In the Year of the Dragon. I'd try this again, but I think I need to go try the original game (which I just traded for!) again!

Need to watch some videos to make sure I'm playing this right. Something is probably not quite right, and I never bothered with construction or catastrophes. 

Want to try the solo campaign, too.

Tableau building with some interactions from the game interest me, and this seems to have an interesting solo mode. And it would be portable. First play didn't leave a too favorable impression, as the rules are too terse in parts (as in, do the population on the luxury goods card count for income?) and some things are actually just plain missing (like the fact you remove the not bought power cards). Additionally when the same catastrophe symbol shiws on the first two cards, you can allmost pack up, as chances of that one hitting you in turn 2 or 3 is high - but you can't really protect yourself. But some of the play felt still interesting, so giving it probably another chance, if in the mood to tackle the rules again.

Card game version of Peloponnes. We had some rule ambiguities, hopefully we played correctly.

This is a pretty awesome translation of the Peloponnese tile game to a card game. It's also somewhat unnecessary, as 90% of the game is identical. I do like the way the calamities are handled better in this, than in the tile game. Still, it's weird to have two functionally identical games being sold as two different things because one is on cards and one is on cardboard.

Regardless, it doesn't matter too much which one you buy. It's a solid game. I went with the card game because I like unpredictable disasters. If you like your difficulty hurdles to come like clockwork, buy the other one!

Not recommended, the game was not a fun experience for us, at all.

Peloponnes auction civ builder with cards instead of tiles. I love the use of the dual sided money and resource cards--makes for hard choices during auction spending. Also uses multi-purpose building cards and starting civ cards. Nice touch for bonus points if you are able to actually hold and not have spent luxury goods by game end. I like the portended disasters and the decisions to prepare for the likely but not certain occurrence. Lots of game packed into a single deck of cards with only a couple of track markers.

-- Sold: 9/17/17 - I'll be honest, the art just didn't cut it for me. It's bad, like really bad, played it once and while the game itself seems pretty great I could not get over the art (or lack thereof).

This was a game that I thought should have been quick but it wasn't.  It just drug on and on ... the rules were kind of weird as they had a lot of exceptions that didn't always make sense.  Played once, have no interest in playing ever again.

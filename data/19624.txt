So far I like this game.  It's deceptively simple, elegant, and there are lots and lots of little colored cubes to fetch and put on cards.  (A little bit like Keythedral, but only a little bit).  You need to be very efficient and very good at judging setting value...

I had to admit, that I thought this was a kids game to begin with. Bit of a fiddly setup as well but it had a lot more to it than appeared at first sight, sort of a combination of a Euro and a race game (though more enjoyable than Fagin's gang). A solid 8.

RATING: 6.5
fun game.  leapfrog movement reminds me of Cartagena, but there's more strategy and purpose in this game than you'll ever find in Cartagena.  timing is everything.  if you send your dwarfs too deep (or send them in too late), you'll get stuck in the mine and have few points when another (perhaps a less greedy) player builds enough jewelry to end the game.

This was a fun little mining game. Send your dwarves down a mine shaft, bump elbows with others dwarves jockeying for position to pick up gems, select jewelry "recipes", complete them with the gems you get, acquire enhanced abilities to make your dwarves better, etc. What's not to like? Apparently a lot. One notable gaming person called the thief ability "broken". Others at the table didn't care for the game. I enjoyed it, despite coming in last.

Great set up for a game that trips over itself in the endgame.  I think it wants to be a mad scramble to get down to the deep end of the pool, but in my one game it was ended with just a few gems taken from near the top and a thief stealing from the market. Update: a second game also ended quickly, well before lower gems were tapped.  The whole thing just felt very negative and ugly.  I'm done.

I'd give this 9 but for the production errors. A superb game from Don Bone, another designer that is finally hitting the right balance. You send dwarves into the mine to bring back gems to convert into points. But this removes the dwarf from the game and makes it harder to finish when you want. Dwarves can move over 2 others to the next free lantern in the mine, and this leap-frogging (similar to Cartagena) is an excellent mechanism that makes tricky decisions. The more of my 6 dwarves I bring in, the easier it is for my opponets to jump me and get to the gems. The deeper into the mine I go, the more gems I get, but the longer it takes to recover them.The dwarves also get abilities (Stamina, Stealth, Thief and so on) and these make for interesting strategies. Plus, you only get two actions a turn, so you have to plan right. Plus you can earn extra actions, but these are worth Victory points if you don't use them. Plus, jewellry you don't complete loses you points. Aaargh, decisions decisions. If I take that design card now, they know I must have these gems out. If I bring the gems out first, they might rib me or take the card before I can. But if I leave the dwarf in the mine, I help them move past me.This is a fun game, with tricky decisions. The rules have some errors and confusion, and the cards have a bad design error, but beyond that, this is a very good game. Light enough for non-gamers, hard enough for gamers.

RATING: 5
Based on one play - this is a classic example of a "Euro-game" - well produced, some interesting mechanisms (albeit none of them very original) and enjoyable without too much brain burn. A slight worry was that I won by grabbing four low point cards while others were concentrating on bigger things. I would need to play it a few more times before deciding on whether various strategies work.

Many thanks again to my FTL Secret Santa for this awesome game.

The Folly in this game is the price point and the not-so-great art. Despite these two negatives, this is a fun game and there is some nice strategy to it.  I certainly enjoyed playing it.  It's a game worth picking up if you can find it cheap, but currently at $60 it's really not worth it. I appreciate getting small titles published but with that artwork and price point, this game isn't going to exactly fly off the shelves.  It's a shame.

Update: This game can be had on the cheap these days. I bet if it was re-themed and updated with better art it could come back I think.

Undoubtedly harsh the first time I played, I warmed up to the idea and would try it again.  There are tricks to know going in, and these are:  Only draw settings as your first action, as you might uncover the kick ass ability for the next guy.  Don't leave gems with one turns grab by anyone if you can help it, they will go out of the way to take the stuff you've been plodding towards.

The game has some good mechanics and a pretty clean rule set. It just doesn't meld together into an appealing whole. It isn't fun to play, maybe because there is so much to analyse and yet opponent's moves change things so much it's hard to plan.

This game sat, unplayed, on our shelf for the past year (after having been picked up for next to nothing at a charity shop. Whilst the box and artwork is a bit uninspiring, we gave it a whirl yesterday. I think it is a great game! The mechanics are intriguing. The theme is more interesting than it first reads, from the manual. I can see we're going to play this several more times, and it will get more heated as we pit ourselves against one another. When one person gets too far out in front, the mechanics are self correcting (as dwarfs are removed from the game) once they successfully forge a particular piece of jewelry. 

Note to publishers: Seriously...get some dwarfs on the box! Battling each other, sneaking past one another, bats flying around the mines...etc. The box art will never sell this game!

RATING: 6
An interesting set collection game. Players move around a board trying to gather gems to complete sets. The cards add some variability, and there was room for some clever play but the "perfect information" movement seems to lend itself to AP. Didn't like it as much as I thought I would.

Components were bad: board warped and big cubes were hard to distinguish from little cubes (the symbols on the cards weren't much better).

3 plays.  Quite fun.  Nice take on the standard pick up and deliver fare.  The ability cards add a nice touch, though I think the Thief might be too strong.  Players MUST keep the end game and winning conditions firmly in their sights, though.

Thanks for the run through with the game designer. Not exactly what I'd expect when playing a game based around a Nordic goddess.

Actually, I'll have a word to Don about this one day. He should re-theme it "Snow White" (if he can get Disney on board) but give the game the Rammstein touch like they did for the video "Sonne".

In essence then, the Dwarves are still running around getting treasures etc, but this time, they're taking them back to their S&M mistress, Snow White, who uses the jewels & gold like drugs. The Dwarves that get Snow White off her face more than any other tribe of Dwarves wins the game. But Snow White should have a "tolerance" level where she might overdose etc etc..

Edit : I got the game for $5, will do the variation myself.....

Very interesting game about dwarves mining for gems and trying to build jewelry. The mechanics felt new (this is my 505th rated game) and were interesting, creating angst in selecting your two actions on each turn.

An action point Euro that shows its age somewhat from the mid 2000s. The players are dwarves trying to delve into caverns to collect up gems of various kinds in order to forge jewellery of various kinds back on the surface. 

It has aspects of Ticket to Ride (jewellery card fullfilment) and Carta Gena (movement rules) but it isn't as good as either game.

It’s a nicely constructed game. It takes the Silberzwerg theme of dwarves mining gems to fulfil contracts, but replaces the simultaneous "out-guess the others" approach with a turn-based action-point game. Players have two actions each turn to move dwarves down in the mine to collect gems, pick up contracts, trade gems and the like. Turns move fast. You can be foiled by other players getting to the gems you want first, but the ability to trade gems is forgiving. Effectively, you’re just trying to move and score more efficiently than the other players. It's not a high rotation game for me, but I liked it.

Only played it a couple times so my rating may change.  This is a light game with just enough going on to require some thought.

The strategies are such that young people can understand them with some experience so I think it is well suited to young people.  

Other than the random set up of the non-amber gems, the game has no random elements.

I think the sweet spot is 4 players.  With three, the mine seems a bit too empty.

Irony: Game made by an Aussie NOT available in Australia until after Christmas...gosh. The Germans have all the luck...and the games.

The game will ship late because of reprint of some cards.

Update: Acquired from Don at the Australian Games Expo, June 2006. Looks like a very well constructed eurogame. Nothing flash or fancy but could gel together well. The board is starting to warp...

Update: Sure, there's nothing new in terms of mechanics but the whole package comes together fairly well. Each turn, players have 2 actions. These ultimately revolve around using a team of dwarves to leapfrog down mineshafts, picking up cubes to complete sets of jewellery cards. There are multiple ways to score points and to trigger the end game. There are also special cards to soup up your dwarves (although I think the Stamina potion is overpowered).

A good euro complete with agonizing decisions and a feeling of wanting to do more than what one can possibly do in a turn. Worth a look.

You are a lonely, hideous, little Dwarf. Your name sounds like someone is gargling rocks: "Gerg", "Alfrik", etc. The females of your species are hirsute troglodytes. Cue the Wagner: Freya appears and proclaims that she will trade you her "favors" if only you can make her a bracelet...

This really tried to be the holy grail of Dwarven Mining games.

Freya's Folly is a nice little pick up and deliver racing game with some nice twists as there are special powers for your dwarves, and alternate endings that change the way things are scored.  Overall this is mostly a nice clean system, with some tough little choices that keep you engaged until the end.  I like the movement and the forced commitment to victory.  What I didn't like was the luck of the draw in the draft.  If you don't want the Bris cards coming out you aren't encouraged to draft to buy as you may unleash an endgame in a simple shuffle fluke.  In the last game I came up to the surface then three theives and three bris cards came out. Steal, Steal, Steal, the end.  Hmmm.  So much for a deliberate game where your choices make a difference.

I was entertained by the Dwarven Pocket Bat though.

I want to believe that it won't happen again, but it doesn't seem all that unlikely.

Freya's Folly looks like a board-game version of Dig Dug. It's a light set collection game with an interesting twist: other players hop over your own men for free, Cartagena-style.

This is a very nice game. Components are great. It has simple rules. The set up is "tricky", but check my variant in the Variants section which actually adds to the game itself. This game has more strategy than what you expect at the start. Also, the player "leading" never knows if he will win the game or not. There are many things to turn the game around. Enjoy!

Freya's Folly is a game that may not have appeared on your radar, but I would recommend it as an enjoyable, solid family game.  The theme of collecting gems certainly works, and the level of interaction is there, although not stifling to those who don't enjoy personal aggression.  Plenty of choices, an engaging look, and fast simple game play will keep this one on my short play list.  Teenagers and adults should look past the ugly cover of the box and find the excellent game within.

Still interested in this game, but still haven't tried it.  It doesn't seem to come out that often at cons.

A very good collection/conversion game with a very low luck factor.  This was the sleeper game for me from Essen 05. It scales well with 3, 4, or 5 players and has two mechanisms to help end the game.  The theme is great and the fun factor is high.

Played it at Essen 2005 late at night, lost bad but liked it. We tried again the night afterwards and was second (second to the Belgian number 1 player) and I still like the game...
Give me some more!!

A unique game - there is nothing else quite like it.  A fair bit of mean spirited play is possible here.  But, that's ok :)

Played a 5-player game.  Too much down time for what the game offered.  Perhaps with fewer players (4) it would be better.

Try to stay with others to move fast. Watch out for the thief. Try to guess what jewelery others are going to build.

Played once (with 3 players). This game has several good ideas, but still there are too many parts which I don't really like. The movement in the mine can be slow (which makes the game a bit too long, maybe), some of the abilities seem much better than others (it might change with a different number of players, though), the thief card allows nasty direct interaction, and while I like the alternate end condition, I think the end of the game is a bit too abrupt (I'm not sure the extra turns which may have been played by a player matter much - but maybe give everyone at least one more opportunity to use extra action tokens?). In its rather precise category "Dwarves in a mine with open contracts", it works better than Silberzwerg for me, but it is not perfect either.

I like the theme, and it plays out pretty nicely. The fact that it supports 5 players is a boon as well.

Once you understand a couple of things about this game, your turns are all about competing for the resources you need.  What are those things?
1. Don't just sloppily gather gems.  Have one or more specific settings in mind before you go mining.
2. Your opponent can only thieve from you if she has a dwarf outside the mine, has a thief card, uses the thief action, and you have gems just lying around in your workshop.  In other words, try to situate yourself to get the gems home and commit them to a setting in the same turn.  If you don't let them languish, they can't be stolen.

RATING: 7
This one is fairly interesting.  I found the drafting mechanism to be unnecessarily clunky, but the area control and various scoring mechanisms were fun and interactive.  Some of the cards seemed imbalanced, but I guess that is the point of the draft.  And vikings killing eachother = fun.

RATING: 6.25
This is a simple smattering of card play, area control, and attempts to judge the relative merits of several interesting decisions.

The nice part of this title is that it plays quickly and is actually enjoyable. It's a light Euro that feels like a heavier Euro. It's very hard to find the proper "word picture" for how I feel about this, exactly.

A pretty good area control game with an interesting card drafting mechanic, a little too light I think though.  5 players is optimal, 4 is ok, 3 don't even bother.

Booster draft meets area control. Simpler and more mischievous then El Grande. Just my cup of tea. 

Components are good; I do wish companies would just make full size cards. Just a personal pet peeve. Little viking meeples would have been cool. pawns are better then blocks though...

Our first concern was that kingdom token sets were too good. But after a couple plays, they seem OK. The gold cards for the kingdom tokens are the best in our opinion. Get one in the first round and you can be sure of 15 points. I like the random Doom Phase just to keep everyone on his or her toes.

Love the systems in this one. Interesting play styles evolve, the card drafting just works - it felt very much like a Knizia design because of the systems interlocking and scoring so well. And wow - it plays *really* fast. I like the theme displayed in the value of dying as a true viking should. Well done!

Bunches of text on the cards, but there's not all that many of them.  They could have used pictograms.  Great length, big box.  A shorter, and perhaps more accessible version of [b]El Grande[/b].  The fonts suck, though.

RATING: 7
Area control with card drafting.  I rather enjoyed this one.  Didn't take too long and plays pretty smoothly.  A fair bit of player interaction due to the majority control for areas.  Since you don't play every card drafted, you get an increasing number of options as the game progresses.

I dislike how Ragnarok can be a windfall of points.  It almost seems preferable to have your pieces wiped from the board in order to earn more VPs.

I'd like to play this one again.

Andrew call it El Grande light, and I would agree.  Despite the fact that I'm a wargamer, I don't generally care for this type of simple area control games.  If I want conflict, I may as well play a serious game like A3R.  The mechanics of Midgard is somewhat interesting, and fits the theme well, but the sum total left a fairly bland taste in my mouth.

This is a game that feels like it plays 1 round too short.  Game play is area majority with a nice purging system that makes the game very unstatic.  The card drafting mechanic is interesting and follows the approach of Fairy Tale (except it does not reverse the direction).   Plays best with more players as this forces the board to fill quicker and makes majority harder to secure.  Good filler or a fast closer for a game night. [GTI: TGCL]

Area-control game with placement and actions based on cards drawn.  With pieces being sent to Valhalla at the end of each round majorities are easily changed.  The requirement to obtain counters from each region keeps the game fluid.  The cards restricting your actions stops potential AP.  All in all there is quite a lot to like in this design which I was pleasantly surprised by.

Area majority with card drafting. Plays fast. Some call it "confrontational" but except for the theme ("Attack one area!") it's really no more confrontational than El Grande or San Marco where you can remove other players' pieces from an area.

Not sure this works with 3, solid area majority game with an interesting draft mechanic. First few games are not a fair judge as you don't know the value of the cards (always a problem with an auction or draft game). Fortunately the game is pretty quick so you can get through those and learn the game.

Certainly quicker than El-grande, I prefer Fire & Ax for scratching the viking itch.

Fun game which hits the right sweet spot for our group on depth vs. play time. We seem to have lots of 30 minute or 90 minute games, but nothing that is too much fun that clocks in around 45 - 60 minutes. Midgard fits that bill, and on our first few plays has been good times.

If San Marco is El Grande's chaotic cousin, then Midgard is San Marco's wild second cousin-once-removed. Oy ve voy! Little long term planning as boards change very quickly.

This is a quick and slightly different, action card driven, area majority game.  While your actions are limited by the hand of cards you have this isn't as random as it sounds as you 'draft' your cards at the start of each turn ('Fairy Tale' style).  

While the setting is pretty abstract the game is actually driven to a large extent by the aspects of Norse mythology represented by the Doom and Ragnarock phases - a suitably Scandanavian touch.  These ensure that half of the areas on the board are destined for destruction each turn - all Vikings there will be sent to Valhalla.  This may sound like bad news for establishing area majorities, and it is, but Vikings were quite happy to be doomed so long as they got to Valhalla and this is represented in the game by it being worth a couple of points per viking - which can really mount up.  That makes the doomed provinces the focus of contention most turns, though there are incentives not to ignore the other areas, and means that there is a different set of problems to address on each of the game's three turns.  Not too taxing but a pleasant diversion.

RATING: 8
Feels like a cross between Mission:Red Planet and El Grande, with a slight tilt towards El Grande.  However, it plays like a new game altogether.  Two things stand out in my mind while playing this game:

1) The card drafting is an agonizing choice.  I wanted to keep all the cards I had and pass nothing.

2) It always seemed there was one more thing I wanted to do than turns allowed, leaving me with really difficult choices.

Both of the above elements combine to make a good game.  I've yet to see if it will last, but we'll see.

Not too hard to understand, but will take some time to really master this one.  The card draft is fun and requires to you make some important choices.

This game rocks!  I bought it after Blood Rage came out, so I knew I'd be able to acquire one on the cheap and it has really paid off.  No miniatures, player boards or clan powers like Blood Rage, though.  The card drafting and area control combined are great in my opinion and with shorter teach & play times, I'm always ready to play this.  It's "Blood Rage Express".

This is a new Z-Man release by Eric Lang, who I just learned is designer of a bunch of CCGs. This is an interestingly themed Viking game where it’s basically a territory control game, except a) the map has very little significance (borders/adjacencies are meaningless) and b) in each of the three rounds 5 of the provinces are doomed, and you want to have a presence in the doomed provinces, because there is glory in dying there (1st class ticket to Valhalla). This game borrows the card drafting from Fairy Tale et al, but it’s substantially simpler, because it doesn’t have all the different ways of combining cards—they pretty much all stand on their own. The vast majority allow you to either move 2 warriors into empty villages in one of the three regions (any province(s)) or move one warrior into and occupied village and boot the tenant out to Valhalla (sans doom, which means coach trip to Valhalla). The game claims 45 minutes, and I think that was about right. I like games like that which pack a decent boardgame experience into sub 1 hour (e.g. Web of Power / China, which actually, it’s somewhat similar to now that I think about it). They also have a nice mechanism where you can also go broad (having some presence in many provinces, rather than control of any) for an alternate scoring potential.

A decaying-area-influence game, where the decay of influence is your warriors dying in Ragnarok. I love that basic premise (as well as the fact that you get points for your warriors being doomed); the gameplay isn't bad.

Many of the gold cards sit poorly with me - though I like that everyone gets the chance to draft one right off, and that you can try to plan around them based on what people reveal from their hand.

Strategy note: Do not spurn tokens. Virtually every time I've played, the victor has been in large part buoyed by matching 3-sets!

Midgard has impressed me. I like the drafting mechanism; you find yourself trying to formulate a strategy as you pick cards for the round.  I think it actually helps speed up the actual playing of cards as players probably have a good idea of what they're going to do after drafting.

There is certainly some luck in the card draw and it sucks when you just don't get what you need.  I also think the extra gold scoring cards are maybe a little too powerful as both games have been one from those.  It may be that players just need to plan for them a bit better.

For its fast play time, though, I think Midgard is a real winner.

Sort of El Grande in reverse, but I really don't like it.  There's way too much chaos to make sense of it all, but so many little details that people take forever thinking before taking their turn.  The card drafting should be a good idea, but curiously isn't, and the map is, well, totally unnecessary.

Nothing special here.  The card drafting mechanic might have been pretty cool back in 2007, but it is pretty standard stuff now (2017).  Draft several cards and play a subset of them to get area influence..which in turns scores points.  Throws in a set collection mechanic based on area's where you have influence.  Has a good chunk of "take that" too which I'm not crazy about. Still I'd play this again if in the mood.  I would never suggest it though.  The theme is pretty thin.

Reminds me a bit of Mission Red Planet, in that it is a card-driven area control game.  Of course, that traces back to El Grande.  But here, there is not always a lot of control, and that's why I say Mission Red Planet.   I'm not sure that the draft is all that important to the game and it created a bit of a drag on the tempo.   As long as you don't get too attached to hanging on to anything, this is a fine game.   There are a few alternate ways to get points, which is a nice touch.  I don't mind the bit of chaos, personally.   Don't think I have room in my collection for this, but I would gladly play it again.

I'll blame being sick, but I chugged to a melon-headed 3rd place in my first three player game of this.   My 18 year old son enjoyed it, and my 12 year old daughter really liked it (she had the victory by a ton of points).

The game itself is easier than it first seems as you try to figure out what is going on.  Three rounds keeps it short and dangerous.   We found that knowing, before playing, what is meant by a "complete set" of the kingdom tokens (i.e. 3, 1 from each kingdom) is important.  My daughter happened to have two sets, but my son and I each tried to get the largest number in a single kingdom thinking that would work for us... and it's not worth any additional points in the end.

Not too impressed by the game, although that had a lot to do with the theme and graphic design. The Viking theme is justed pasted on, it could have been anything, and the graphics and cards didn't impress me much either. One village and one boat cut and pasted across the board, the heavens being neatly placed in boxes. Plus we kept removing the pieces for Doom before handing out Kingdom tokens. The board was too big, the card graphics and text were too small. The game itself? It was okay, but nothing too exciting. Both the card drafting at the start of each round and holding some cards over were interesting, but if you are being passed on rubbish, what choices do you have? Building up from 4 to 6 actions and the Kingdom tokens gave some balance, but it was hard to consistently attack the leader. It was all okay, some choices to be made, but it didn't seem to flow and had no real feel to it. I'm not sure either that anything needed fixing, it was all a bit mmmmmmm okay.

El Grande plus Fairy Tale. But the sum is greater than the parts. Cunning plays by holding back powerful cards before the first pass.

Update: Going last in turn order is an overwhelming advantage, and one that's often just based on luck of the draw and seating order. Lowered rating.

Plays fine, an area majority game with multiple scoring paths to balance.  I thought the theme came through reasonably - particulary the vikings queuing up to go to Valhalla.  Fast enough to be a lead-in to a "main course" game.  Scored 50 points in area counters in my last game to sneak the win - got to watch that!

I am not a big fan of card drafting in general, but I still enjoyed this game.  Being familiar with the cards is a big plus and it can be a big challenge to get more pieces on the board.  It's a nice area control game that isn't too taxing and plays quickly.  There are better out there, but this fits a nice niche.

I just purchased this game last week and have only played it once, but I had a great time.   This is not a traditional wargame, more of a pseudo wargame along the lines of Shogun.  Object is not to conquer and hold territory, but to collect as many points as possible, which are accumulated (amongst other ways) by dieing gloriously and being sent to Valhalla.

I think one of the biggest appeals of this game is it's unique approach.  This game wins points for being refreshingly different and haveing solid gameplay that is just the right amount of time for a "quick game." I have to give Midgard a high recommendation.

RATING: 6.5
I welcome a game with a war theme that is not a wargame. It's actually a nice Euro game, with card-driven area control. Luck of the draw is highly reduced by the card drafting mechanic, just like in "Fairy Tale". But even so, the "destroy" cards may be a little overpowered, as they can cause a lot of damage to a single player. In the end, the game seems to suffer from the same problem of many warfare games, in that the winner is usually the player who is least attacked. I like the viking theme, but very dull graphic design and generic wooden pawns don't do much for it.

A warning: The game doesn't work well with only three players. The only time I played with that number, I felt the board was too empty, even though there was only one or two pawns that didn't enter the game. There should be special rules, such as playing an extra card and having a few more pawns.

Not half bad. The scarcity of pieces means that you can't do nearly enough with the cards you're given, and like many area-control games of its kind there can be significant screwage and kingmaking. The Valhalla/Ragnarok mechanic is awfully nice, though, and it is exceptionally thematic.

RATING: 7
Each time I play this, I am more impressed with it as a really great abstract area majoritygame.  The scoring strategies are very well balanced and the card drafting is a lot of fun.  

However, perhaps no other game I've ever played is as desperate for a retheme as this one.  

The drafting is fun, the strategies are varied, and there is a lot of interaction and screw your neighbor.  It seems to have a little bit of run away winner problems, but that is probably supposed to be taken care of by ganging up on the winner.  If this had a theme like "control flower gardens to please your regent" or some similarly caylus-like theme, I bet it would be a pretty big hit as a short, low complexity euro.  The viking thing probably alternatively turns people off and disappoints them as they realize they are playing a bean-counting eurogame, not the viking bloodfest they expected from the box.  The game would also be a little easier/quicker without having to figure out where everything is.  

UPDATE 2012:  As I keep playing this game regularly, the one flaw that is starting to show is that inexperienced players don't beat on the winning player enough, and the game has a rich get richer problem if everyone is just maximizing their own score without beating on the winner a bit.

ジャケと出版社によってミスマッチの不幸を起こしている気がするけど、至極真っ当なドイツゲーム。
エリアマジョリティで、どこにおけるかはカードによって縛っている。で、そのカードをドラフトしてからラウンドを開始する。それを3ラウンド繰り返す。
いわゆるブースタードラフトのかたちで、ランダムで、レア1枚、アンコモン2枚、コモン3枚のパックを作ってからスタートするというのは、ありそうでなかった。レアは派手めな効果ではあるけれど、状況によってはピックしないということも十分にあり得るし、ピックしなかったとしてもそのカードによる影響を考えながら以後のピックに活かせる。

I don't care much for many area control games where the lead player gets excessively pummeled.  That said, I still find this one fairly enjoyable.  Although you can't always hurt the lead player while promoting your own cause well, other players will usually have enough control that the game can become more of vote to see who wins.

First played this on Feburary 7th, 2007.  At first this game seemed complicated, however it really isn't once you've played once.  The cards are mostly the same so the initial learning curve is all that is an issue.  It really didn't take long to explain or setup either.  There is a minimal amount of luck to this game (getting right cards at the right time) as it mostly surrounds strategy and being diverse. Each player starts out with 5 vikings (6 are also off the board for new warrior placement) and one large viking (with 1.5 vikings for tie-breakers) and a starting hand of cards to draft from. Each is given one gold card (JAM tokens, score a region, two new vikings, destroy a province, draw 2 bronze cards and play one, etc), two silver cards (attack province with one viking replacing one viking(send to valhalla), viking hoard move 3 vikings, etc) and 3 bronze cards (invade province with 2 viking, 1 new viking, etc). 10 chits representing each province are randomally drawn to place on doomed provinces(warriors will be sent to valholla at the end of the turn for a bonus). Choose which card you like and pass to the left until everyone passes the final card. Next players play one card at a time for 4 rounds. You may also place warriors in asgard (majority gets 5 VPs; 0 VPs for ties) or Vadaheim (majority warriors receives JAM chits of their choice; 0 for ties). Each province you occuipy you receive a chip of that letter. Each time you spell JAM you get 5 VPs at the END of the game as they are kept hidden. If you have the majority of vikings in providences you receive a certain number of VPs. The more in a J,A,M region, the more VPs. Doomed vikings reward VPs and sent to Valholla. Then all vikings at Valholla receive a VP each and sent back to the viking ship for redistribution. The next two rounds are played the same, however more cards a distributed and more rounds are played.  Each turn you will have more cards that are unplayed using for later rounds.

This is a very journeyman like effort at a Eurogame.  Everything works, nothing is broken, but there is no real spark.  Someone at our table mentioned that the theme was almost a distraction.  It served only as a reminder about how thinly applied the theme was.  It lacks the elements that would make this game shine -- there is no narrative, there is no meaningful marriage of theme to mechanics, and there is little by way of novelty.  The whole card drafting system was interesting, but sadly, not very important to game play -- it felt like a mechanic for a mechanic's sake.  I understand why this game has its adherents.  If I wasn't approaching my 800th different game, I might find some true pleasure in Midgard.  But, as it stands, its not an experience that really calls me back.

Area influence:card drafting:hand management:set collection

initial rating one play 5 players Essen 06

The world is ending and some provinces will be doomed! Quite a surprise that this relatively unknown final prototype was one of the games I enjoyed the most at Essen. We had a chance encounter with the designer on the train after the show and learned that he lived 2 streets away (sheesh small world) and he just finished a new game that sounded cool enough for Z-man to publish. After some brief game desciption we sought out the Z-man booth the next day to play but sadly Eric wasn't there.

This felt like part war and part area control but more of the latter and different from other games in the genres. Really it isn't too war like but you are pitted directly against your opponents on the map, you do 'attack them' often in an EG kinda way and the theme invokes a war-like feel so this is why it feels a little like war but is really AC. The game consists of 3 rounds and each player starts the game with 6 action cards and chooses one before passing the rest to the left and this continues until no cards are left and everyone has 6 cards. Then play starts by playing a card which involved several things like: invade a territory (move into), place a warrior from the off-board supply, attack and kill one opponent, horde card (major movement into one territory). Then there are the gold cards which kinda act like special power cards used to score a region, destroy a region(major screwage!), take tokens, take new warriors or draw cards. At the end of a round you collect tokens for provinces you were in and score points for provinces controlled in varying levels. At the end of the game you turn in any sets collected for more points. This forces you to spread out on the board in order to score large and I liked this aspect.

I liked the drafting effect as you got to see most of the cards out there and it helped to mitigate the luck somewhat that can be had by being dealt a hand and also allowed some foresight as to what is going to happen. Still luck can stymie and limit you somewhat as I didn't get a lot of good gold cards in my game and also where the doom tokens come out as that is random, overall I think it was in good proportion though. Some gold cards seemed a little overpowered like destroy a region albeit I see now that we played wrong as all of the gold cards should be revealed, this would of helped to serve as a warning. I'm not sure I liked how turn order was decided, in our game one player held a high gold card and kept going first. The doom mechanism works very well, as your people die off you lose influence for the next round but gain points balancing the effect. I noticed card stock was quite thin but I'm not sure if it will be released that way. One other thing on cards was it seemed you kept seeing the same cards over and over again during the draft however I think that this is mostly necessary to ensure proper play and balance. 5 players was quite good even if a little chaotic, 4 probably ideal and 3 should be good too.

Fast pace, good length (60-90), interesting decisions, excellent scoring, serious screwage, good replay, some strategy, great tactics and fun made this a great game for me. 

[u]UPDATE[/u]: I stand by my rating, great game with lots going on and lots of screwage and perfect length around an hour, I was 30 points behind the leader in round one and had given up hope, after round 3 (the end of the game) I came in second by 5 points, another nice aspect of the game. The big strength of the game is the return on time investment ratio which is very high IMO. Price does seem too high which is currently stopping me from buying it however.

[u]UPDATE[/u]: Acquired for a good price, 4 players definitely best, 5 is a little too chaotic and 3 not enough competition on the board.

Rating based on 1 play, 5 players.  Wouldn't mind trying this with 3 or 4 as that could up my rating a little.

One problem is the luck even though the cards are "drafted" Note Dame style.  The folks who were able to get their hands on being able to add more of their reserve vikings into the game did much better.

Second problem is the game "tries" to mitigate the luck by having the player who "drafted" in theory the strongest card that round go first (which of course in area control game is not the best position)... 1st it should take into account any held over unused yellow cards players have, but more important is that the person to the right of the start player for the round is in the best position (going last) even though they may have the next best yellow card.  Maybe variant of turn order not being clockwise but by rank of yellow cards (and for those with no yellow cards based on where folks are on score track)?

Initial Rating: 7.0 (February 2016)

I have had Midgard since 2011 and I never played it because when I tried I couldn’t get the proper sleeves for the game. Then, I misplaced the game for a couple of month so I didn’t know where to find it within my game collection. I finally found it and found some sleeves that will work.

When I told a friend about the game, he told me this was the predecessor of Blood Rage I had no idea but this didn’t bode well for the game as I really dislike Blood Rage, and after playing it, Midgard is a very regular game for me (and VERY similar to Blood Rage). I think if I have played it when I bought it I would have liked the game much more. Now, I realize I have changed a lot during these years and this kind of game isn’t for me. Having saying that, all of the other players liked the game.

The rules are very easy, you can explain them under 10 minutes. It is a bit less complex than Blood Rage, but the core is there, unchanged. Players have to draft over three ages and then play the cards to define who wins at the end. Like Blood Rage, I find the decisions here to be (mostly) obvious and uninteresting. There are lots of “take that” (and I no longer enjoy this kind of game) and “attack the leader” (I also dislike game with this mechanism).

I don’t like nor dislike the theme. It doesn’t do anything for me.

Midgard plays very fast (less than 1 hour), and that its main appeal.

The game components are ok, they work well but after seeing the magnificent miniatures from Blood Rage, you cann´t stop yourself from comparing them. And in that light, Midgard fails. But that’s the only aspect in which I feel Blood Rage is superior.  

I liked Midgard a tad more than Blood Rage. It is more unassuming, more simple and quicker. The draft is more interesting in Midgard due to the gold, silver, bronze card system (but it’s pretty obvious as well). There are a lot of luck with the cards and the draft cannot control it. 

Bottom line, I don’t have Midgard in a high regard, however I would play again if requested. I consider it superior to Blood Rage (but not by much), but Chaos in the Old World is the best iteration of this game. Many friends like it but it is definitely not a game for me. I will sell it ASAP.

Definitely an interesting area majority game with many integrated parts.  Just like most area majority games, you certainly don't want to go into the last round in the lead as you will get hosed.  There is good value in winning majority in provinces with ragnorak as it will score points 3 different ways and produce chips that can help score sets.  There definitely seems to be some ambiguity in the rules but the game plays fairly quickly and the card drafting mechanism is interesting.

A solid showing full of tension, and a game that will take more than a few plays to work out all of the strategies.

Ignore the comparisons to Fairy Tale and El Grande. Yes it has majorities, and yes it has drafting (a great part of this game).

Update:

After a couple years' hiatus a 5 player game was instigated, and it continued the tension. I think after having played so many different games that the strategy is more obvious than my first plays, however the competition combined with the drafting mechanism make this fun as long as people don't over think their moves.

Area control of El Grande meets booster drafting.  Midgard plays quickly, more so than El Grande, I think.  There are more ways of scoring points as well.  Consequently, it is a little less intuitive for me as to how to win.  After 3 plays, I'm still enjoying the pace of this area control game.  It seems less prone to analysis paralysis than many games.

A surprisingly good game, especially since it was a Tanga special.  I rate this one a little lower since I've never seen anyone win without controlling a fair number of "bring new warriors in from off the board" cards.

It hits a sweet spot as a quick area control game, however, and this makes it an easy game to get out on the table.

The seemingly unnecessary "card drafting" could possibly be eliminated. This would thereby decrease downtime and speed up the game. 2 pluses!

Another review wrote: "This was the first game I presented to some non-gaming friends, and I've been asked twice to bring it again. I appreciate the simplicity of this game."

Worth reading Shannon Appelcline's review on RPG. Some comments include:

"Midgard is a simple majority-control game with a card drafting mechanic. Majority-control games largely hark back to El Grande. This one is a lighter game that feels a lot like El Grande, but plays in about half the time. As such it reminds me the most of last year's Mission: Red Planet, another game which felt like a faster-paced version of El Grande. Comparatively this one is simpler and less baroque than MRP, though it also goes back to an El Grande element that I've never liked too much, which was the ability to really beat up on a leader."

"Overall Midgard is a quick-paced, strategic, and enjoyable game."

"Overall Midgard has quickly become one of my favorite majority-control games, up there with El Grande, Web of Power, and Mission Red: Planet. As such I've given it a full "5" out of "5" for Substance: an excellent, fast, strategic game."

Only played this once. I played it wrong, but the group still had a good time. I thought at the end of a round, ALL the vikings went back to the boats, but it turns out that only the ones in the heavens do. That would make more sense. I wondered why they all decided to retreat after they conquered some lands.

Surprisingly simple game to learn, but requires some impressive strategy and a good helping of luck to achieve victory.  I really enjoy how your hand of cards is put together with the, 'choose one and pass the rest' mechanic.  There's any number of ways to win, and a clear victor never certain until the end (although I did run away with my second game against first timers). 
A definite plus to any collection, and one that should see a lot of repeat play..

I enjoy this simple card drafting area movement game. Most card games suffer from the luck of taking a good hand, but the card drafting option helps to alleviate the randomness of a draft. The game turns into a choice of trying to maximize token sets or trying to "doom" (die a glorious viking death and go to Valhalla) your troops and thus gain extra points for them. I took a "doom" strategy in my first game and beat out the "set collector" by a good margin. Interesting mechanics.

A good area control game with some card drafting. I'm not usually a fan of card drafting but this works well. I really enjoy the way that player pieces come off the board for big scoring which leaves areas open for future rounds. This game doesn't overstay its welcome.

Thematically & mechanically, it's my kind of game & there's lots of beating up the leader (or the perceived leader which is not necessarily the same thing). Smooth, quick, beautiful production & everyone ends up in Valhalla. Have to love that.

The drafting of cards is interesting. The powerful gold cards are good to have, but the higher the value of the gold card means you go first & going last is also advantageous...

An underappreciated game.  I only noticed this title because of the price, at the time.  With only a few plays, the gameplay is quick without too much AP.

OK area control game where players use cards to play pieces onto the board and are trying to gain majorities (think El Grande).  

Ragnorak causes certain regions to be destroyed which clears parts of the board so you can begin new area-control tactics next round.  However, the pieces lost just go back to your ships (to be used again) and you score points.  The points for these areas seemed a bit high in my opinion.

There's card drafting each round which I enjoyed where you take a card and pass the remaining cards to your left.  You continue this until all the cards have been passed out.  It allows you to see a number of cards and also build you hand.  

Nothing really new here but fairly solid gameplay altogether.

Pros: plays quickly, tough choices between grabbing points early with the doom provinces versus establishing long term majorities.
Cons: Boring drafting mechanism, yet another "bash the leader on the victory track" game, components are functional but a bit dull especially the board, doesn't feel like a Viking game at all.
Overall, a decent game but I prefer El Grande for its richer mix of tactical and strategic choices.

In this area control game, there are three regions on the board. Each region has 3 or 4 provinces. First, cards are dealt out to each player, a gold card, two silver cards and three bronze cards (the gold cards are generally the most powerful, and silver are generally more powerful than bronze). Players select a card, keep it, and pass the rest clockwise until everyone has acquired 6 cards. Then players play cards one at a time to put men from their boats onto the board, or put men from their supply to the boat, then onto the board. Provinces are identified to which will be eradicated at the end of a round. Tokens in that "doomed" province will earn more VPs. In each region, earn more VPs for more majorities that you have. Having a presence will also give you a token for that region. Play over 3 rounds. Each set of 3 tokens from each different region is worth 5 VPs at game's end. The mechanics are generally recycled from different games, but this is a fun fast paced game. There is a lot of thinking on what you want to do, and the exposing of the gold cards adds an interesting twist to the game, since the opponents know you have it, but do not know when you are going to play it.

A fast playing area control game with card drafting.  I like the game for its simplicity, and my first play was actually a funny experience due to the groups struggle with card drafting on a redo/missed rule.

Nice, clean interpretation of a quick El Grande. I enjoyed it much more than expected, liking the pass the card mechanism that defines where you can place later on, plus the scoring rules that encourage people to move their concentration from region to region each turn, keeping things in constant flux. Established positions in area majority games are the bane of fun. Thumbs up.

Fantastic game.  Typical zone control games get out of hand where getting out-competed in a sector is an insurmountable loss due to the wasted resources and scoring chance, but this game has built-in "consolation" scoring if you lose your position to aggression.

The game falls in the El Grande family but is different enough to offer a fresh and unusual approach. Drafting presents each player with difficult choices and timing the actual play of the cards can be critical. There is plenty of confrontation and, at times, it appears that there might not be a piece left on the board. The game is simple enough to teach casual gamers yet offers the choices that a hardcore gamer enjoys.  Each and every turn is tense. Finally, the game plays quickly enough to allow for several games in one evening.

This was an ok game. But why play this when I could play El Grande? You say its shorter? So what, it also isn't as good. Not only that it is too chaotic. Turn order has a huge effect on what you can do and unbalances the game. Likely won't be playing this again, at least not with 5. At least in El Grande you feel like you win or lose because of your play. Not in Midgard.

RATING: 7
One each of 3, 4 and 5-player games. Quite interesting with lots of opportunity for screwage. Going first is a very bad thing so I'm not sure any benefit accrued from a high-numbered gold card makes it worth keeping. Going first in the last round is an almost sure way to defeat. Collecting tokens may be too powerful and not getting any cards to bring men in from the stock is sure to doom your chances. Play more easily the second time around. Would enjoy playing again.

RATING: 6
The drafting mechanism is the most interesting part of the game keeping one card and passing the rest. 
Like the area placement dividing the board in to halves which will score and be removed for victory and the other which is retained for future positioning. 
The chits groups forces players to spread out - looks to be a balancing to concentrating in a province for scoring.

A solid game - but one I see could lose replay value

I didn't have big expectations about this game, but after a play I can say that I liked it very much.  A nice, easy and non pretensious game of majorities with a very original card setup for every phase, in which players pick an action card and give the ones that they don't want to the other players until every card is taken.  This way it is possible to design a strategy, know where to fight and luck has a lot less to say.  Even when the theme is pasted, paradoxically it feels very thematic.  You actually get into the role of vikings crushing enemies, settling down and being rescued by the Valkyries to enjoy life at its best in Valhalla.

Area majority game with set-collection, and driven by card drafting. Like El Grande-lite, but with action card drafting. A good introduction to the meatier area majority games.

Sometimes, just having the card and the threat of playing it is as good as playing the card itself.

No, there isn't any combat or any Viking exploration in this game. Instead, what you have is a typical area-influence game. Each turn, cards are drafted. Then players take turns to play a card to either place or move pieces around several regions on the board. Scoring happens at the end of each of the three rounds. Players get points for majorities in each county of each region. There are also points for playing Vikings certain (random) areas. Toss in set collection (players get a token for influence in each of the counties) and you have a mishmash El Grande meets Magic game.

Not bad really. It plays quick (an hour or so) and there are decent decisions to make but it's nothing new. The component art doesn't do justice to the quality of the box art. Worth a look but think the RRP is too high.

RATING: 7
This is a highly interactive area control game; one that rewards points and prizes in a much different way than the typical El Grande clone.  Presence is as important as controling an area.  If you manipulate your pieces to fall in Ragnarok, or you are focusing on region chits, winning isn't nearly as important as it would be if you take a region dominance strategy.  

I should mention that much of this game is controlled chaos.  There is a high level of interaction, which is great, but very little in the way of protecting your position.  You have to be willing to accept that people are going to hose you.

I have to say I was a little disappointed in the card & board art, and the pawns just miss the mark. While funtional, the design drops the ball with what could have been a visually dramatic and beautiful game.  Being that drafting and card play is such an important part of the game, it would have a much more enjoyable if the cards were evocotive of the theme.  The general art design felt like a prototype.  Even with the strange abstraction of a heavily thematic game and having to stare at the garish boot, the game sits well with me.

A Viking (loosely) themed area-control game with card drafting and some twists.

It was a fun game, and should play reasonably quickly once you know all the cards. The Viking theme is there very loosely, although it is nice that you get rewarded VP for fighting and dieing in the doomed provinces, and for making it to Valhalla. The token set-collection allows for a hidden element (although it is trackable, who's going to bother?) and gives you some more interesting decisions during the game. Still, I'm not sure that I need to own it (although I did buy it!) - need to play it again before opening my copy!

I don't think I played many area-control games but I'm kinda thinking it is not my most beloved mechanic. That aside, "Midgard" offers some fun with the drafting (I think I would have liked a bigger variety of cards though) and the never ending joke of getting points for going to Valhalla which essentially means dying. The game is not overly long which is something in its favor. Middle of the road for me, I'd play it but not ask for playing it I think.

Picked up for $5 as an auction filler, local pickup, no shipping. This has got to be one of my best cost per play values of all time. The game plays quick and easy yet it’s surprisingly satisfying. It scales well 3 to 5, has almost no setup time, and consequently gets to the table frequently.

Man, I really like this game.  If you take Fairy Tale and put an actual game on the end of the drafting then you've got Midgard. 

I think this one is definitely best with 5 as it creates a lot of fighting and tension.  I think the board may shrink with less players, but I'm convinced 5 is the way to go.

Fun game.  I know the rules don't suggest drafting on the first round for the first time playing, but if you're an experienced gamer you'll have no problem drafting right away.  I really like the tie break with the leader.  This will definitely hit the table again.

I'm starting this at a 7 rating, but that may rise with repeated play. I must say, I was very pleasantly surpised by Midgard. The ratings here are just OK, and three people whose opinions I value in determining whether a game is worth trying rated it 5 or below ... junk bond rating. Still, despite low expectations, igot this one to the table and I'm glad I did. It even went over well with a group that is pretty resistant to trying new games and quick to pan anything not up to snuff. Midgard is a light area control game that has a characteristic that I value highly ... it's short (box says 60 minutes, but I think this could easily be played in 45 minutes by an experienced group) but has a meaty, epic feel (Yspahan and Web of Power also fall into this group of big bang for the short time expended). The BGG stats showing 40-something people wanting this while nearly 100 want to trade it are a bit deceptive, I think. This game was available dirt cheap from Tanga at one point, so the traders aren't necessarily all people who hate the game, but rather are folks who picked up extra copies specifically to trade. Anyway, my recommendation is to ignore the mediocre ratings and the high number of traders and give this a try. And if you like it, there's no shortage of people willing to trade a copy to you!

The fiery game of Viking conflict promised on the box would not arrive until Blood Rage, nearly a decade later.  Instead, we receive a pleasant but bland area majority experience coupled with card drafting.  Most of the rules are scrawled on the cards, which makes Midgard easy to teach (and tough to read).  This is simply the wrong theme and the execution is desperately cheap.   Those who bought a war game hated the contents, and those sho would have loved it, never opened the box.

Decent area control style game. The way the players' movements are structured with a limited number of cards leaves a feeling in my mind that much of the scoring comes down to the luck of the draw. I'm not entirely attracted to this game after one play. I'll give it a few more goes and see how I feel then.

It's a good area control game.  I thought it was pretty unique.  I especially like the card drafting at the beginning.  You have an idea of what special cards are out there, but you don't know them all and you don't know who has what. 

There are some good decisions about which areas to try to control.  If you can control a safe area (no doom token), you get a head start on the next round, but you get points when your men are sent to Valhalla.  You also get them back so they can be used again.  The heavens could be a big factor in the game, but we concentrated on the main board when we played and really didn't do anything in the heavens until the last round.  Getting the right set of kingdom tokens by controlling the heavens could be pretty important.

When we played, we had some questions about the balance of the scoring, but unfortunately, I don't remember enough about it to know if they changed the balance or not.  I plan to buy the game as soon as it comes out.

Update: Played it again after a long time. Had a great time and the game really synced very well. The glorious death of Vikings in Doomed Regions need to be watched out for and enjoyed if they are your Vikings walkign off to Ragnarak!

*******************
This one interests me. After one play the rating might seem a bit low but that might change. There's an interesting dynamic to this game that I'm just getting my head wrapped around. Its a Euro game for sure as the theme is mainly in the graphics, but the draft system combined with an area majority is a very cool concept that I am interested to see how it goes with some more experienced players.

In 2015 a subpar game, would have rocked in the 90's but pales compared to modern games. Had interesting mechanics in the the way you drafted your actions and combined with simple area control. Despite low rating we had fun, but it was more thanks to the group than the game and for me one game was enough.

Area majority with a bit of a twist. It seems that it is most beneficial to die where the doom tokens are; the points for doing so really add up. I came from last to second by doing this! Doesn't seem right.

A perfect example of how the Euro board game market is saturated with uninspired mediocre designs. The type of game that Ameritrashers would have a field day criticizing, especially since the artwork actually suggests some level of thematic immersion (not that I care about that stuff, but I can see how it adds insult to injury for others). On top of it all it isn't that good of a game, which is catastrophic as it does absolutely nothing to set itself apart from the gazillion other area-majority games out there.  I'd play if asked, but only to get brownie points with the person wanting to play.

The world is ending and only glory remains! The sky darkens and the earth is on fire. The time has come for you to lead your clan of Viking warriors to glory and conquest in the battle that will end the world" the battle of Ragnarok. Draft your battle cards to plan your stratey, then join the fray. Will you deploy your warriors carefully and surely across the lands? Will you rusd headlong into Jotunheim to control the largest kingdom of all? Will you send some of your Vikings to the heavenly realms of Asgard and Vanaheim to bring glory from above? Every path you take brings you closer to your victory, but every path you don't take is left open to your enemies. Nothing can stop the destruction of the world of men, but the vravest fighters will have a place of honor in the halls of Valhalla when they meet their end. Will you lead your clan to triumph, or will you burn in the ashes of the world that was?

This is one of those unfortunate games that somehow finds a way to be less than the sum of its parts. The theme is awesome, Vikings marching to war on the eve of Ragnarok. Midgard being first and foremost an area control game, this should be a match made in Valhalla.

It starts to break down when the pieces hit the board. All of the vikings are plain wooden pawns, with a bigger bowling pin shaped leader. The pieces are fairly static once placed and "warfare" is simply replacing an opponent's pawn with one of your own. It is, in a word,dull.

The card draft that begins each round is the most interesting part of the game. Here you draft both scoring opportunities and the action cards that let you deploy your pieces. Being a card draft, if you pay attention you can gain some intel on where your opponents are going to be focusing your efforts. Still, when it's all said and done, the actions on the cards are all again, very dull.

There are certainly some interesting decisions to be made and I can't in any way say this a bad, imbalanced or poorly designed game. It's simply boring, which is almost the worst outcome of all, considering the action packed box art.

This was all rectified somewhat in Lang's remake of this game, Viking Fury. Core game play remains the same, but the new version adds amazing miniatures, more freedom of movement and much more interesting combat. If you can afford it, get that one instead.

A quick game of area control. Place your men in provinces with invade, attack, and other actions. Simple and fast. I kinda like it. So far we played it with 3 and it didn't work that well since we had plenty of empty villages left on the board. I'd like to try it with 4-5 people.

The only thing I didn't like was the choice of the starting player, which is the one with the highest golden card. Perhaps I need to think about this some more.

This game is pedestrian and ordinary.  It is a poster child for the theory that there are simply too many games being published.  Is it a bad game?

I need to seriously reconsider my faith in Z-Man.  I'm only interested in playing six of the company's games (Pandemic, Lifeboats, Neuroshima Hex, Dungeon Lords, Prophecy, Ubongo), out of like, a thousand. And even then only if I'm in the right mood and with the right crowd.  

Of course, my opinion clearly isn't the best predictor of sales.  For an accurate sales forecast, you'll need to do a regression analysis on a few rarely-considered variables: new game smell, board texture, and public insanity.

We totally played this game wrong the first time.  We didn't realize that each region had many villages (as indicated by the drawings on the board) that you can occupy, instead, we thought one region meant exactly one village, so every time you want to move into a place where someone else is already there, you have to use the attack cards.  As a result the game seemed to lack strategy.

Our second attempt was much better.  Midgard really opened up with a lot more choices.  However, I will say that although I like competitive games, I felt this one is a bit too vindictive to my liking.  People often get back at specific players even though it would have been a better choice to go after the leader.  This is an example where a bad choice from your opponent can greatly cause another to reap undue benefits, and for that, I'm not sure I like it very much.

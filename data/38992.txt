There are a lot of resources to balance here.  I kind of liked this one, but it wasn't well received by the group.  Not much theme to it, which may be part of the problem.  Overall, pretty good though.

Beautiful board and neat Euro mechanics. It is fairly dry, but feels like a substantial game with lots of strategy. The rules are a little inelegant at times, with many exceptions and broken conventions. But it stands up alongside many much more famous games (Fresco et al).

Not a bad game, quite playable but nothing much special.  On the positive side, there's lots to engage the brain and some of the mechanisms don't feel quite as over-used as with some games brought out over the last few years.  There are elements of a Notre Dame style placement and certainly Fresco built something from this too with the tile placements on the board and the way you collect them.  I like the way tiles in the centre are likely to become the cheapest by mid-to-late game, but the ones on the edge score more at the end.  The changeable room set up and special power on the cards and tiles are nice too.  On the negative side, there is VERY little interaction here and hence minimal screwage to ramp the game up.  The down time is big.  You can easily be ten minutes between your turns and it's merely a good time to grab a drink or pop to the loo,,,not much point doing anything else as the board will change before your next turn.  This also means that there is a lot of AP, especially at the end.  A solid 6.

Worker placement + area control.  A few twists are thrown in for the scoring (park edges, cards).  Artwork is very nice!

The game feels very well balanced among the various strategies and options.  The exception might be for player order.  Not sure whether or not the start player is at a disadvantage.  (Need more plays to see how that pans out.)  The game is somewhat mechanical -- moving servants (meeples) around to gather resources (coins, seals) and spend them on nobles.  Fair bit of downtime between turns and it's very difficult for players to plan ahead (since positions are constantly in flux).

Even in view of the above, the game plays well.  Not too long, somewhat strategic, fair bit of replay (random arrangement of nobles and of rooms in the palace).  Not too difficult to pick up.  Plenty of choices, though they tend to diminish as the game progresses.

I would like to play this one again.  If I like it enough, I may have to pick up a copy.

Good light-medium weight eurogame. Nice artwork. The game uses an action point system which is a mechanic I usually dislike since it tends to lead to Analysis Paralysis. But this is not the case, cause this game is not a brain-burning game. There is little player interaction, and I am not convinced that the game has enough replayability. Still the game flows quite well and offers some choices to the players.

Reasonably interesting worker allocation/worker capabilities, tile-purchasing with modest spatial bonuses, engine/combo building game.  

It feels like it has 2.5 dimensions, and perhaps needs something a bit extra to elevate game play to a higher interest level.  Not particularly interactive with the exception of majority bonuses and tile purchasing geometries.  That extra oomph might be found in the cards, and card play, which we touched upon just a bit in my first game of it.  Happy to take a win on my first play.

Based on my only play so far, rules seemed a little complex (when all players were new) so took nearly as long to learn the rules as play the game.

Would give another chance, some fun planning elements and strategy in how to setup your resources to purchase the highest scoring tiles.

First impression was very positive.  I could tell while reading the rules that I was going to like it.  Generally love the art and components: castle tiles, park, nobles, even the meeples.  Found the turn flow very cool with the rotating majorities.  Has a slight engine-building feel because of special nobles, enough to give it some flavor.  Still feels a little sterile but I think the solid gameplay, great art, and satisfying playtime all do enough to push it over the edge for me.  Random tile distribution helps, gate in the middle with new players.  I've played enough to say that I don't really want to play this one face-to-face with 4P, and 2P was a little boring as well.  This started out great for me, but after several plays I think this has settled into a "perfect for play-by-web, don't care about it anymore in person" kind of game.  Still, plenty to enjoy the first few times with quick players.

This game was played by several friends before I ever saw it and ever one of them said - "this is a game for you".  They aren't always right when they say that, but they sure were with this one.  Its an area control + area majority hybrid.  With compound actions and multiple turn strategy and planning required.  Lots of interesting variation and decisions to be made.  Play length may be just 1 or 2 turns too long for a super tight design, but the last few turns are still very important and can swing the game if its very close.  All-in-all this was a hit with me and likely would be for fans of area control / area majority.  Very good game.

Excellent game; fun worker placement game and I enjoy the theme. The game would probably be more popular with another theme attached--something maybe like "Elven Assassin and the Orc King" or something like that.

RATING: 6
While the pawn movement mechanic is somehow interesting, it can get frustrating at times. Also, evaluating the whole grid can cause a lot of AP.

UPDATE: After playing it a bit more, I've come to the conclusion I really like this game. It's, at it's heart, a pure resource management game, but with very interesting area majority and drafting mechanics thrown in. It gets a little time to get used to, but in the end, it's a very worthy 8 for me.

UPDATE: Starting to lose a bit of it's appeal. It's a great design, but sometimes it falls short on the fun department. Sadly. Down to a 7, and likely it will stay there.

RATING: 8
Acquired Essen '08.  Gain majorities by claiming tiles from the palace.  Some interest in the manipulation of your workers between different rooms which give them different abilities.  But didn't find the game exciting and do not feel need to play again.

Second game enjoyed more, increased rating.  But I was able to pick up both of the extra movement tiles in my first turn which game me a considerable advantage.  Verdict out on whether something like this occurring can unbalance the game.

Third game.  Enjoying this more and more (despite finishing last as I tested strength of different tiles).  I suffered from lack of movement this time.  The game is quite unforgiving making it difficult to maintain momentum if you're trying to reorganise.  Nice design

I have a weak spot for the artwork made by Michael Menzel, so I had to buy this game. It is a slightly-lighter-than medium-weight pure euro, with interesting mechanics: there's a worker placement element, but every player takes its full turn before other players can make actions; there's a strong majority element, both in the form of action bonuses and scoring. In the end, it'a good abstract game where the theme is strongly evoked by the wonderful "baroque" art of Michael Menzel!

Managing your servants well is trickier than I expected.  Unfortunately, I find the positional battle for bonus points on the noble display area sort of dull.  Perhaps it gets more interesting if players spend more time analyzing the board.  However, do I really want more downtime in a low complexity game?

I only have one play of this, two player, but I have to give it an 8. This falls in the same weight category as Stone Age for me, but has slightly simpler rules whilw more comples and AP inducing gameplay. It looks beautiful, plays in 1.5 hours and manages to feel fresh and familiar at the same time. This will be a staple two player game for us, just like Stone Age.

Edit: Have played it with three players now, and is just as good.

Very good. Seemed a little fiddly and over complex to start with but settles down to be a great little game requiring rather more thought than would first appear.

If I had a criticism it would be that there seem to be rather too many options during the end game - our last round took ages, but that is carping about a game that is finely balanced and nicely produced.

Two player.  

A solid game.  Lots of ways to go about getting your points and using your people to recruit nobles and such.  Both of us who played took different paths to get there.  Beware of AP!  It's not a min/max type of game, just a bunch of options on how to use your workers.

Not sure if I would play this with four. It was fairly easy to get into and I know it will be easier to teach someone the game now that I know how to play.

Another game of worker placement and efficiency.  Much of this game (perhaps too much) is spent moving workers to buildings that will allow you to deploy or move additional workers on subsequent turns.  Many victory point tiles provide free actions, necessitating the re-allocation of your work force.  This becomes a tedious efficiency exercise.  If you like these mechanisms, the game has tons of replay value because both the buildings (action tiles) and VP tiles come out at random in the advanced game so no two games will be the same.

Another bland euro I loathe - why do I get talked into playing this type of game?

A repetitive, dull and overly long efficiency exercise. Not helped at all by the graphic design of having 2 'resources' that are tiny and so similar to my colour blind eyes I spent most of the game asking which was which, not helping my enjoyment.

Overall, dry as dust with a pasted on theme, this could be wigits in a factory, ants in a colony or meeples and cubes to solve a puzzle.

No desire to play again (and I won!)

A thinky Euro with elegant aesthetics. Be warned: There are many details left unexplained in the rules set, so you better be prepared to do some research on your own. The grade is somewhat preliminary, as I'm uncertain how good the replayability is.

Del mismo diseñador que el troyes. Es un juego de mayorías y colocación de trabajadores... pero la colocación de trabajadores no es en cualquier sitio. Entran a la parrilla de opciones por un sitio, y una vez dentro de "palacio", deben moverse. 

Hay que ir "comprando" a los nobles que pasean por el jardin de palacio para que te otorguen ventajas y puntos de victoria. También controlando los bordes del jardín se pueden obtener puntos de victoria (y con cartas).. 

El juego está muy bien pensado... sencillo de explicar y de jugar.No son muchas acciones en las que pensar, pero el movimiento de trabajadores y las mayorías lo hacen muy atractivo. Una mecánica muy original y recomendable.

Look up the word "Eurogame" in the dictionary and it'll have a picture of Royal Palace beside it.  It's a very thinly themed, light-medium abstract.  Would definitely like to play it again, but don't feel a burning need to own it at this point.  Most noteworthy aspect of the game is the "back door action" (and no, I'm not joking!).

RATING: 7
This is a very good worker placement/management game.  In many respects, it is like Louis XIV - similar theme, similar matrix of choices, similar board setup, etc.  What limits this one for me is the tile grab.  Louis does have random endgame elements that many hate, for sure, but I guess I prefer that to this, where you feel that, in the long run, the buying of tiles from the gardens could be a bit too samey.  The random nature of the board helps mitigate this, and makes every game fresh.  Don't get me wrong, this is a very refined, elegant design, and should be on every 2 player wantlist if you like medium or lighter Euros.  It might get old, but it likely won't hit the table every day, so I'm not too worried.  Solid, solid Euro.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A worker placement game unlike any other I've played. I really like the idea of using some of your workers to move others, while using yet another group to bring more workers into the game. Deciding which noblemen tiles to take depends not only on their location on the board (empty spaces make them cheaper, edges promise more endgame points), but also on the location of the colored seals and the office below the board. Movement via the staircase strangely becomes the game's most valued resource, which makes this feel very different from other games. It lasts a little too long, though, to hold my interest through 24 tiles and the gameplay starts to get really repetitive toward the end. In the future we'll shorten the game by a few turns.

I like the balancing act of the castle system.  The way servants are brought in, moved, and consumed to win nobles / prestige cards is quite elegant.  Can suffer from AP, especially towards the end.

First couple turns I thought this was clever, and I was getting into it. But it wore out its welcome before the end. It was just a little too mechanical, a little too themeless, and not different enough from other "build up an infrastructure than switch to buying VPs" games. That sort of game has become de rigeur of late, and honestly, there is just better stuff out there. Made me want to play Louis XIV again, a game to which it bears some resemblance, but Louis XIV just felt a lot tighter and had a more cohesive theme (which isn't saying a lot, but it was enough to matter for me).

RATING: 6
Nearly every new Euro these days fall under the "pretty decent, but not great" category, and this is another one of them to throw on the pile.  Seems like a game I've seen before many times with some slight changes to make it it's own game.  In the end, I really like Eurogames though, so it's a fun puzzle to figure out and still a decent game.  However, it's definitely a very generic Euro that didn't really excite me with anything new or original.

The gameplay of Royal Palace is a little too simple considering the amount of AP it provides! We’re definitely not prone to AP, but in this game you have some movement points for your servants, so you need to think about where you want to place them in each round, and if you place them in that and that room, you’ll get this and this, and then you can go and get this noble from the garden to score points (yes, the game has no theme). You need to plan a bit. It’s not brainburning or anything, it just takes a while!

I’ve only played two games of this, and none with 2 players as my wife refuses to play it as she finds it very boring. So, even though I haven’t experienced everything the game has to offer, I don’t think it’s a very deep game. Strategy wise it definitely seems like a good idea to, as early as possible, get a noble who gives you a bonus each round rather than one which gives you a lot of points (it might seem like a commonplace, but it’s really important to get extra income or movement etc. - you are going to have a much easier time playing the game!

I think it is a clever idea how nobles decrease in price if other nobles around them are removed; however, I don’t really think money is as big an issue in this game as I had initially thought. It wasn’t that hard to come by; the same goes for the seals. This made the game a little uninteresting as it wasn’t that difficult to get what your wanted. Maybe it is harder with 4 players as it might be harder to get the majority, but to be honest, it was often possible to get the majority on your own turn if people had bought a noble on their turn, because they would then have removed servants from the king’s and queen’s rooms.
I loved the additional endgame scoring of the garden; this made it much more interesting as to which nobles you wanted to purchase! Maybe you could get a cheap noble with a permanent benefit in the middle, but on the other hand you would also want to buy that expensive noble in the corner for endgame scoring purposes! Interesting decision I think.

After my first game I actually thought of which strategy I would pursue next time, which is obviously a great sign. Having said that, however, the gameplay isn’t really that exciting, and I’m sure that it’s not a game I would enjoy playing more than a handful of times; the replayability seems limited. After my second game I’m not in a hurry to revisit it again, and while it’s certainly not a bad game, it’s not exciting either. And I own too many games to keep those which aren’t interesting!

Royal Palace has the dubious honor of being the 2nd game I traded away without playing (the first being Acquire). I won a copy at Origins Game Fair, and the fact that it's the same designer as Carson City had me a bit giddy with my dumb luck.

...and then I read the rules. Yeesh. This strikes me as particularly inelegant, with a game about meeples and majorities for different actions and currencies (cash, king favor, queen favor) and then cashing those in for VPs. The problem is that there's some odd exceptions here and there with the different areas, and that conversion of game resources to VPs strikes me as utterly uninteresting. 

I'll normally play a few turns of a game solo to learn the game and prepare myself for teaching, but with this one, I couldn't be bothered. I hope someone else finds enjoyment in this title. Off to the trade market it went.

Hidden gem. Strategically placing X number of servants in rooms to take X number of actions. That makes sense. Collecting seals and cash to buy VP. That makes sense. Little extra things to boost efficiency. Those make sense. Its a buttery smooth experience. Xavier Georges is a master designer, and that shows here as well as anywhere.

Fun worker placement game that gives bonuses for area majority.  Action point system is easy to use.  First play with 2 was fun, because it was new.  Secnod play with 3 was fun because it was with 3.  I think I've played it enough, where subsequent plays would be less fun.

Simple to pick up but requires thought to master. Move servants round the castle to gain resources to allow you to take control of the nobles in the garden. Random noble and castle layout make this a different game each time. Not a bad game but time will tell if I keep playing it or not.

You have 9 randomized spaces arranged in a 3x3 grid which are summarized here though I don't recall their names:

-Bring people from stock to the entry points based on number of people here
-Entry Point - No other function
-Move people orthogonally based on number of people here
-Gain money based on number of people here.  Money pays for cards and nobles
-Each of your people at this location can be traded to your stock for resource that gains you nobles - Type A
-Each of your people at this location can be traded to your stock for resource that gains you nobles - Type B
-Each of your people allows you to look at that many cards.  Trading in your people to stock here here let's you keep that many cards that you've looked at.
-Trading in your people to the stock here allow you to influence that many noble.  Nobles cost money and resource type A and B.  They give VP and sometimes a special ability.
-Most of the other spaces give you a benefit if you have the people majority.  Majority at this spaces give you majority at other spaces if there is a tie.

All of the nobles are in this large grid.  When you influence the noble you take them off of the board and get their benefit.  People on the outside of the grid require you to place people there and then each of the four edges have people majority tabulated for points at the end game.  Adjacent empty spaces in this grid make remaining nobles cheaper.

It works and the game does have this influx and purging  of people, but it's nothing exciting and doesn't feel overly strategic.

To do - ck the rules.  One player purchased 5 nobles tiles on their last turn, which seemed a lot given that player was also buying 1 - 3 each and scored about 100 pts. above my opponent.
Have to read through all of the Forum notes re the rules,,, certainly some, such as the hand limit, which are important adds.

Set in the 17th century palace of King Louis XVI, players use servants to collect nobles and points - has a sense of worker placement.  Very impressed, I wonder about down time issues with 4 player games, but it's great as a two player game.  Takes some time to get the knack of, and your first play might be disappointing, but don't give up!  I'd put it on the same shelf as St Petersburg and Notre Dame, but with a very different feel.  Terrific components.  Definitely worth looking at.

There are some interesting ideas here in terms of moving your workers to claim control of tiles and get bonuses, but it's so mechanical and tactical that it ends up being a rather dry, tension-less experience. You have to wait for others to spend time optimizing their moves before it's your turn to make them wait while you optimize yours. Practically no forward planning due to how transient the board state is. Interaction is just getting there first. Somewhat similar to Louis XIV which I find to be a much more enjoyable game. Not a long game though, so there's that.

RATING: 6
This is a well developed Euro game.  You have resources in about a half dozen different categories (money, meeples on the board, movement capacity, blue and purple seals,...) and the trick is to make them come out even (like milk and chocolate chip cookies---sometimes it takes several tries!)

Very much enjoyed this attractive, worker placement game.  Finishes were close.  

There is some luck in the draw of the cards, and so far there seems to be one start that is always successful ..dividing all your servants initially between parade & staircase. Also the game is hard to win if you don't get additional servants, especially when servants are placed on the higher scoring outer edge for the duration of the game.  From then on it is a race to see who can get which nobles.  

I always enjoy boards that vary with each setup, and this is one.  There can be some brain freeze especially near the end when your servants are numerous, majorities come into play, and multiple Nobles can be gained.

The positional movement aspect is refreshing, but I'm somehow not comfortable with it.

It's a simple worker placement style game with beautiful artwork that places the gamers right at the center of life at the Palace of Versailles.

When I say the game mechanism is worker placement then that is a little simplistic.  New workers (or servants) can only be added to the Gate area of the board, and the number depends on how many servants are present in the courtyard.  Servants added to the board will stay there unless they are used to purchase cards or nobles.

It is by careful placement and movement of the servants that the players will be able to maximize the actions they acquire.

All in all a game my wife and I really like but others in our gaming groups aren't so keen.

Első ránézésre kicsit emlékeztetett az Istanbulra, de játék közben kiderült, hogy nem sok köze van hozzá. Elég egyedi a játékmenet: a különböző akciólapkákon lévő figuráink száma határozza meg, hogy mit hányszor hajthatunk végre. Ez még talán nem is lenne egyedi, de nem rakjuk újra minden körben ezeket a figurákat, hanem a lapkákon maradnak. Van egy mozgatós akciólapka, és ez határozza meg, hogy mennyit tudunk átcsoportosítani közülük körönként.
Egyedinek egyedi, de kicsit egysíkú szerintem. Minden körben szinte ugyanazt azt kell csinálni, és csak annyi a feladatunk, hogy kiszemeljünk egy nemeslapkát magunknak és kiszámoljuk, hogy most akkor hogyan is tudnánk azt megszerezni. Ez meg már inkább puzzle, semmint társas.

Royal Palace defies exact categorization. It looks a bit like a worker placement game but isn't. It has elements of area control but those almost seem like an afterthought. It doesn't use action points, either, but something vaguely similar.

The end you use these unusual mechanisms for is fairly profane, however. There is a large area of scoring tiles of various sorts, and your efforts are primarily focused on securing the prerequisites you need to buy the tiles you want. Since there are only three types of those resources and most of your placed servants come back into your supply when they procure them and so need to be placed again next turn, the game can feel somewhat rote after a while.

The random mix of scoring tiles, and especially the random configuration of the action spaces within the palace itself help combat this effect a bit, especially since games aren't overly long.

The most interesting aspect if this game is that the board is not the centre of the gameplay. Nine tiles that you place randomly next to the board draw the attention of everyone around the table. The rules are pretty simple yet the game itself is not. I had a great fun playing 'Royal Palace'. Certainly the artwork by Michael Menzel contributes to that feel.

All in all a fine worker placement game.

Enjoyable game, different enough mechanisms to keep it interesting, kind of sticks to its theme.  One problem seems to be the difficulty planning for your turn - other players actions change things so much that the tactical nature of the turn means you have to do the calculations from the start of your turn, meaning some inevitable downtime.

I had the great opportunity to test this little gem as a prototype two years before publishing and I'm happy to see that the game became published and works so much better now. I love the mechanics of getting in new servants, use them for number of movement steps and how many to bring in next round, getting gold etc. The mechanic intermingles very well. There is just a warning about Analyses Paralyses, especially with new players, otherwise it might have gotten a higher rating.

Wow, i think this is the first euro-game i give anything higher than a five.

The theme is "kind" of there, but the mechanics are what shines with this one. Especially if you place the tiles randomly. Because that influences the strategy greatly!

You're constantly thinking about your work-force, the ammount of movement you'll need & the ties you wanna break & even the area control of the garden is cool.

But be aware of AP players, because the other players turns influence yours, you can't really plan ahead. Swift decisions are key to keep this game going.

(04/25/2009) Comment based on one play.

A fascinating worker-placement, er servant-placement game. Imagine Versailles during the French Monarchy: the rooms are bustling with servants running around to attend to the various noblemen and royalty, like a bunch of kittens scurrying about trying to please everybody. The more servants you can place, the more "resources" (i.e. two kinds of royalty seals and gold) you collect, and the more noblemen/royalty you can "buy off" to get VP. Some noblemen/royalty give you extras: more special cards (which give you really neat, almost game-breaking stuff), more gold, more seals, or added movement capabilities (move diagonally or more spaces). The theme is rich, play is fast, and the rules are relatively simple, although some of the mechanics take a little getting used to. Another very solid game that can be explained and played within an hour. Rating: "7".

The random board layout seems like it would help give this game some longevity if you were to actually play it dozens of times.

The double-sided tiles (one side contains a full explanation of what it does when you are learning the game, the other side just has (small) iconography but looks much prettier) is also a nifty idea.

The "worker movement" mechanism is an interesting twist on the usual worker placement fare but that alone wasn't enough to make this game standout.

It also felt like it was overly "mathy" and that's coming from someone who likes Power Grid. Everyone who played this had the same reaction, "I felt like I could make a decent but not great move after 60 seconds or I could spend 5 minutes doing math to find a better move."

It seems like it could lead to worst kind of AP. Maybe I'm wrong but since the game didn't grab me I doubt I'll be playing it much anyway.

A nice area control game wherein it is very important to get as many meeples on the board as possible--but it's also important to take them off so that you can play them back again.  Players move around the palace  gathering resources and getting a bonus for having a majority.  The goal of all this is to buy noble tiles which can also give bonuses.  It's a clever game, but a bit long for what it is--it can get repetitive and what happens in the beginning is rather important.  It's not especially original but it is in general well-executed.

RATING: 6
It's a good game, the problem is once you understand it (after 1-2 plays), there's not enough depth to explore on future plays, the only thing that changes is your execution depending on location of the action spaces and the tiles.

So while I think it's better than the rating that I've given it, playing it doesn't excite me in the slightest.

RATING: 7
Worker placement/tile aquisition game very much in the Euro mould, but nicely done. While it's not complex, having the opportunity (and indeed, need) to move your meeps once placed adds a new element.

Like many of its ilk there's absolutely nothing to do on your opponents' turns. Even planning opportunities are limited as your opponents will change the shape of both the worker board and the tile shop on their turns. Have to say I prefer more player interaction, even in worker placement games - for instance, that found in the designer's follow up Carson City.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A game that teaches you balance.  Limited 'Servants' allow you to perform various actions and the number of pieces in certain areas allow for reinforcments, movement, and purchasing power... and it's the delicate balance between these actions that make the game interesting.

Going first appears to be a VERY strong position, especially with the 'place 5' rule... and the money compensation doesn't appear to provide the balance that it should.  Having the first chance to attract a noble can be powerful if the right 'bonus' power is chosen.

Play is OK, but it's not one of HiG's better efforts.  Random noble placement and castle rooms make each game different, so I've rated the game a little higher.  A borderline '7.'

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Fun puzzle game.  Good and bad - you can get up and walk away when it's not your turn because planning is futile.  The board changes so much from turn to turn that you have to reanalyze the board when your turn begins.  We've found this to be a plus in that it's not so serious and we can do a bunch of gabbing meanwhile, however, if you're looking for an interactive worker placement than go elsewhere.

RATING: 7
This journeyman euro combines worker placement with majority control. I can't think of another placement game that shares this precise combo. Some of the majority bonuses make sense, such as getting a +1 to your action if you have the most workers in a location, but others, like scoring the most points if you have a majority on each of the borders of the courtyard, make no thematic or logical sense at all. With 42 unique nobles to recruit, there is a huge missed opportunity here to add personality and humor to what is a fairly dry, humorless game. The  game mechanics overall, though, are pretty good. The way palace rooms and nobles change location from game to game is a nice way to add variation.

We liked the game, but it didn't blow us away. Pleasant enough. Because they chose the blandest of euro topics combined with the blandest of competent art, I predict that this will end up over time under-played and under-appreciated by the gaming public.

RATING: 6.5
Perfectly good game but I'm a little jaded to really recommend it.  It seems a little mechanical and familiar although there are genuinely new mechanisms here.

Players move their pawns around a 3x3 palace.  Each room grants some sort of benefit.  Some grant money or seals which are used to buy VP tiles.  Others put more of your pawns on the board, or give them greater movement.

I've seen some criticism of this as math-y or brain burning, and I haven't seen that at all.  

The interaction comes primarily from scooping up good tiles before your opponents, or gaining the majority bonus in each room

RATING: 5
Played this online a few times now to verify my impressions. I don't feel compelled to play this more and downgraded my rating to 5/10.
---
Ok game. It feels odd that most of the time the active player has the majority as usually the servants get used in players' turns and get taken from the board. The additional seal for the majority holder is a fiddly mechanism which disturbed me the most. As each player goes through all phases it takes a long time before it is your turn again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A pretty good game, with a lot of decisions to be made.  I think is possible to miss the forest for the trees here, and focus on getting too many abilities or setting up the edges and losing focus on overall victory points.  And I think it has a lot of replayability.

I had a big bias against the game before I even opened the box.  The theme is yet another tired "influence European nobles" mess, which is so overused that I really dislike it.  On top of that, I tend to also really dislike this particular period of history - I have the same problem with Louis XIV (though Louis XIV at least grounds itself in people that actually existed - Madame Pompadour?  Please...)

But when I started playing the game I was intrigued.  The mechanisms, while nothing new or innovative, felt fun, providing a good challenge.  I was amazed that the game ended up being really close, when I perceived a huge disparity in our performances.  Ultimately, the game ends up being a little scripted and repetitive to be truly great.  I think it could improve with further play, and I'd definitely be in to playing it again.  My rating could even go up.  But I don't see this one becoming a perennial favorite.

After 7 plays:

I think this is a great medium weight Euro and somewhat overlooked.  After about 4 games I started skipping the beginner setup even when teaching to beginners.  The random setup adds a whole new dimension to the game.  The random setup does take a little bit more time since it is harder to enlist the nobles, but the strategic possibilities open up.

RATING: 7.5
From the designer of Troyes and Ginkgopolis, this is a hybrid of area control and worker placement, the number of your pawns that are in a space has an effect on the production of the tile, and if you have to most pawns on the tile you get a benefit. After a couple rounds the turns are pretty quick as you try to gain resources to earn the most points from noble tiles and end game scoring.

Have only played with 2.  Could see this bogging down with 4--lots to do on an individual player's turn, which means that downtime for everyone else could become unfun. I love how it uses worker placement, area control and resource management though.

Played in Essen 2008. The game-mechanic is well designed, but... there aren't anything new. The biggest issue for me is, that first one player will make all the 5 phases, then it's next players turn to do the same etc. This means downtime -problems, which means that there aren't that much to do when it is not your turn (you can't make your decisions before your turn, because the game is more like "what can I do now" than "what longtime plans do I make". Updated 07/2011: Yes, nothing have changed. Royal Palace is one of these games, that you might play it if there isn't any better games available, but there are so many better ones available, that you don't actually choose this before those better ones...

Played a second time years later and was less impressed. Still a fine game but I didn't find myself very engaged in the game. Dropping rating from 7 -> 6.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

I was pleasantly surprised by this euro.  I'm not really sure it is anything new or innovative, but the game is interesting in the ways the mechanics are tied together.  Servants are placed around 9 different areas of the palace, each room does something different, often dependent in some way on the number of your servants you have placed there.  If you are in the majority in any room, you often gain a bonus as well.  You have servants moving around the palace primarily to aid you in recruiting some nobles, some of which grant you huge points and some which grant you minor points but special abilities.  It all comes together in a solid package with little luck outside of the potential cards which you don't know what you will receive.

RATING: 7
I had never heard of Royal Palace until recently, but it's by the same designer of one of my other favorite games, Troyes. This is a much lighter affair, but it was pretty good anyway. I'm surprised how little buzz there was ever about this game actually.

It has a hint of Istanbul to it (the configurable tiles and the movement in the palace), plus the usual buying tiles for points, some engine building, and some light area majority.

The coolest thing by far is how the servants in the palace give you abilities depending on their number and where they are (including how many movement points you have and how many new ones you can add each turn).

I really liked my first play. I played the game a second time, and it felt very similar to the first play. That's not a bad thing for a light game, but it made me feel I didn't need to own it after all.

Cube pushing at its best. No theme whatsoever. Seems to be a mix between the "Accumulation" of meeple from Notre-Dame and tile collecting. It is however less static than notre-dame since you can move your meeple around the board. Gameplay is a bit repetitive.

I like games where you have an immediate control of your, for want of a better word, engine. This is a different beast than the gradual built-up in, for example, Puerto Rico or Dominion, where your decisions only make themselves felt over the course of a couple of rounds: I’m talking about games where you balance your available resources on the fly. Racing games are an obvious choice for this, while victory point puzzles, more often than not set in medieval or renaissance Europe, are usually not. Palais Royal bridges that gap, and does so in a mostly successful way.

While you place workers on action spaces, it differs from classical worker placement in that you perform your whole turn for yourself; interaction with other players lies only in competing for majority boni rather than the outright blocking of available spaces. Two of these action spaces determine how many workers you get at the castle gate and how many of them you can move towards the eight spaces with useful actions. Since the actions that actually gain you victory points „use up“ the workers placed there, you have to ensure a steady flow of new workers.

Although this churning of palace lackeys can be a bit procedural, I feel that it is a small price to pay for fresh mechanics, and Palais Royal felt very fresh to me. Although I’ve only played once so far, I expect quite a bit of replayability due to the different placement of the action spaces for each game. All in all, a very intriguing game that I’d love to play again soon.

Probably one of best looking games available today.  Tight decisions and some serious strategic thinking make this a brain-burner that's actually fun.  Certainly worth the price, and the replay value is just as good.  I think game time would be seriously reduced for any group once all players are familiar with the game.

In the same category as Louis XIV, Palais Royal has more replay value in my opinion due to the nature of the park where you pick powers to use throughout the game.

A worker placement majorities game that plays within an hour.  There are a lot of interesting decisions to make.  Ultimately you're trying to get workers out to the palace garden to collect victory points.  Each palace room has a "power" and you get a bonus if you have the majority in that room.  In many cases the room's benefit is to be spent to buy VP chips from the garden.  When that benefit is used a number of your workers are spent/removed from that room, which continually changes the board play and brings workers back into your hand for future placements.  My initial intuition is that this game may have a long shelf life and could see a lot of plays.

Of a piece with Dorn's Louis XIV, but not as good. It's a bit of a mad scramble; there aren't distinct objectives player to player, and so it becomes a dash to acquire the best sequence of nobles to build an engine to acquire more nobles.

Looks like Hans im Glück is back in business after a longish streak of less interesting games (Wikinger, Oregon, Ming Dynasty, Hanging Gardens); This one is really good, and plays in under an hour. 

The competition for the most interesting tiles creates a very nice tension, and the tile powers add a nice little engine-building aspect to the game.

Might be a bit problematic with AP-prone players. The player aids are flimsy paper sheets instead of the usual cardboard tiles.

Fascinating area-control with a daunting set of variables to control, and hence no obvious strategy. Several key aspects (such as not being able to 'bank' seals and balance between workers in your supply and on the board) are sublimely controlled, and the random board layout makes for an intriguing range of interplays. The outstanding presentation is a delightful finishing touch.

Put your dudes out to build a bit of an dude-building-and-placing engine, then build and place dudes to gain VP's. Not that dissimilar to Notre Dame really, but with a lot more downtime. The guts of each turn is how to use your movement points. Then, what to go for - low VP's but gain long term engine benefits, or high VP's with no advantages. And whether to place in the middle so you can re-use dudes, or place them permanently on the outside and go for end-game bonus points. The game feels long and a bit repetitive; I wouldn't want to play with 4. Turns are somewhat similar - setup, get - and there's not much extra saying please explore me further. Still, it's pleasant enough and it certainly works.

A very enjoyable board game. It feels a bit like playing a more complex version of Louis XIV due to the theme, setting and some of the mechanics, but it's sufficiently different to warrant playing both, although I do prefer Louis XIV. It's a great game nevertheless. Great components.

A questo servono i grandi editori, a prendere buone meccaniche - quelle di Vauban - e a ri-ambientarle in un posto diverso da quello previsto. Xavier Georges non aveva pensato a Versailles, ma le sue meccaniche ci stavano a pennello.
Gioco di maggioranze con un palazzo reale componibile (per rendere le partite più varie), Royal Palace ci piace perché è semplice e di durata contenuta.
Ha un meccanismo di reclutamento interessante, che pone davanti a una scelta i giocatori: prendo nobili a poco prezzo e ottengo bonus per la partita o recluto grandi nobili che mi daranno più prestigio alla fine?
In alcuni aspetti del gioco si vede un po' di astratto, ma Royal Palace è un gioco assolutamente godibile.

RATING: 7
This is an area control game in which you move pawns on a 3x3 palace grid to score nobles, which give you a combination of victory points and ongoing special abilities.  You have to at once manage how many guys you have out, their positions, and your income to best score the nobles.  It has more strategy than first appears, as you have to decide whether or not to "save up" for future turns, which can cut other people out of getting bonuses.  I like the tie-breaking method, as well.

Good game, nice mechanics. But this game gives chances to think and count too long. Minus 1 for that.

RATING: 7
There's a lot of options in this game, perhaps too many since you really can't plan too much ahead. So much is affected by other players' choices. So the good thing is that there is somewhat good amount of interaction since all the majorities and already bought tiles may alter your plans.
The bad thing is that this may launch a massive AP-assault when played with correct type of players.

The game itself looks just like a basic eurogame. Wooden pieces and cards included, nothing too surprising. And with playing time of 1-1,5h, the package is complete.

There is a core of basic optimization game in this but a bunch of new variables are added to alter the result a bit. The precounting of majorities is really hard so it is as if the game forces you to play in the moment.

Definitely a good game after all!

The problem I had with my one play of this game is the downtime: once I did my move, it took 10 or even 15 minutes before I could play again. And it's no use to start planning your next move, because you have to wait to see how the board is at the start of your next turn :s;

Update 05/06/2011: Played it for a second time after several years, this time with fast players and enjoyed this game a lot more. So the rating with depend on which kind of players I'm playing with;

Although the mechanics aren't exactly unique, it feels very different from anything else.  The random board setup could drastically change the strategies/outcome of each game which is nice.  Downtime can be a bit bad as there's many options on one's turn.  Very little player interaction though.  But all-in-all a fairly fresh, sold game.  Recommended.

A game I have owned for a few months but finally got around to play. Solid euro game from *one of my favs* Xavier Georges. Using the nobles for actions and collecting the materials needed to claim the garden tokens. Definitely a solid game and one I would play again. Not enough to really scream, LETS PLAY, but good enough for a Nod of approval. Nothing compared to my beloved Ginkgopolis or Carson City or Troyes. Happy to have played it, and it is now on the trade pile.

RATING: 7.5
This is a very good Euro type game. Sometimes it takes time to figure out the best options for your move and downtime can be a factor, but this is not a bad thing unless playing with impatient gamers. I like the indirect competition that goes on in the grabbing of nobles and the fight for majorities both on the edges of the board and in the castle. This game can feel a bit too dry however with repeated plays.  The artwork is first rate and sets a great mood. Recommended for Euro game fans.

RATING: 6
A combination of worker placement and area control.  There are some interesting ideas (workers have to move to adjacent actions, bonuses for majority player, variety of different types of actions, need to manage additional board with nobles).  Still, there is a lot of downtime, and the game is a touch slow.

As I understand the game nearly had a Mars theme, but one publisher was willing to publish it as is.  What a pity because this is really a tired theme.

Cannot say I liked this one. A very try and bland worker placement game and pretty much a blend of Louis XIV and Fresco, two great contenders for the JASE-Award of the year.

Played two partial games so far. The first one ended with us enjoying the game but too tired to continue. The next evening we tried again and this time we had a repeat of our first Aton experience. That is, the scores were lopsided and it was pretty clear it was just going to get worse as we went along. We made the mistake of setting up the palace randomly on our first play. This resulted in the Gate (entrance) being in the upper left corner while the Mint (coins), King (blue seals) and Back Door (cards) were in the lower right. I knew movement points were going to be important in this layout so I snatched up both of the "+2 movement" Nobles right away and also grabbed one of the diagonal movement Nobles. That was pretty much the end of the game and everything after that felt like going through the motions to just end the misery.

Just prior to playing our first game of this, my wife and I had a discussion about why we like playing games together and what we like in a game. I like to experiment with a game; poke at its mechanisms and see what would happen if I tried something that seems suboptimal. Some games lend themselves well to experimentation and games with high enough luck factors will sometimes even reward you for taking risks. My wife likes to play intuitively. The plus side is this means neither of us suffers from AP. The down side seems to be that neither of us enjoy engine efficiency games. Tinkering leads to you building an inefficient engine with little ability to recover. On top of that, suboptimal play seems to result in a game that goes on far too long, with one or the other person conceding early just to end it.

Examples of games we've disliked that fit along this spectrum: Dominion, Glen More, Caylus and now probably Royal Palace. What should you take from this mini-review? I've lumped the game alongside some very highly regarded games and I suspect that's fair. If those are your type of games, you might like this one. It's not for us.

We're going to play this at least one more time, but with the Gate in the center and the Back Door orthoganal to it. We're hoping easy access to cards can increase the luck factor just a bit and provide more power to a greater variety of engines.

No rating yet, but I suspect this will get a 6 and go into the trade pile.

Royal Palace is like a prettier more interesting version of chess when it's played with two people.  I think the art and the theme makes it seem lighter than it actually is, and with two people it plays delightfully quickly.  It's a solid game.  The theme is pretty pasted on though.  Luckily, I don't mind because it's more interesting than the theme in chess.

One of the first games I played with the movement/worker placement mechanic.  Really liked the privilage cards as a secondary strategy option. Have to keep a close eye on the nobles board for cheap tiles. We all had a lot of fun with Royal Palace, however the game seems to suffer from serious analysis paralysis/ long wait times since a player really can't plan out his turn until the previous player is done.

Royal Palace is a run-of-the-mill Euro. All the single mechanisms work, but to me it is not that interesting. In every round you do almost the same every time with only little build up (tiles get cheaper and bonus tiles improve your actions). It may be played quickly, but in my group some players tend to uber optimize which makes this game drag on over its welcomeness.

Based on one play this looks like it could be a pretty good game.  I like the need to balance youir choice of actions; although it is possible that more plays will reveal that the "choices" are obvious -- a concern offset somewhat by the random set up of the board.  This is certainly is on my "play again" list but not near the the top. Initial Rating 6.  [2009-APR-05]

Interesting collection of mechanisms, none of which are groundbreaking but that come together for an enjoyable game. It may be a typical Euro-style game, but that's what I like. The artwork is excellent. A caveat: because the game presents numerous options on a turn (where to move servants, which nobles to buy), analysis paralysis could be a problem.

RATING: 6
Xavier Georges is one of those designers I am intrigued by... all his games have some originality about them without being groundbreaking.

Unfortunately, very much like Ginkgopolis, Royal Palace descend into chaos as the number of players go up. Downtime increases as well, to the point of being problematic.

As a 2 player it plays well for a majority game (in the garden at least, in the castle the majority aspect is quite subtle), but has a strong repetitive quality (or flaw if that bothers you).

I'm also not sure that there are many ways to develop an engine (unlike Ginkgopolis), clearly movement points is the number one critical 'resource' to prioritise and the rest (seals, money, servants) need to be managed so they may be acquired roughly in the same ratio every game, regardless of the random setup in the garden.

And when it comes to the Castle spaces random setup, this seems to merely offset the importance of movement potential in that particular game, affecting all players equally.

Still, it's not a bad game, but it's another game from this designer I find intriguing but not particularly interesting to play on a regular basis.

Another solid game from Hans im Gluck. Players assign 'servants' to acquire money and other resources to buy victory point tiles. In the early game you go for tiles with bonuses for game play (and less victory points) and later on you try to maximize the points. Replayability supported by having a random board for each game (you need to move from 'gate' to other parts of the board to acquire the resources. Also the tile set for victory points varies from game to game. I enjoy games where you need to balance the different resources you need with special abilities (tiles) and your own resources (servants).

Fontos, hogy hol helyezkednek el a kegyenceid, mert az dönti el, hogy mennyi új embert vihetsz az udvarba, mozoghatsz az udvaron belül, vagy új támogatót szerezzél.

I enjoyed this last time out, when it was called Louis XIV :)  Seriously though, this is just another perfectly fine Euro with a good mix of mechanics and some AP issues.  There are some weirdnesses that make me think we were playing wrong (pieces coming off some rooms but not others) but a lot of different tactics (I stumbled into the "draw lots of cards" line by mistake but it turned out to be almost viable.)   
I would still pick Louis XIV over this, but it's not dreadful by any means.

It is a light enjoyable Euro that would be perfect would it not devolve into serious AP.  There are so many things that you can potentially do on your turn that you need to really process all your actions.  It is fine for three players but I wouldn't play it with more as majorities would be tougher, and the downtime would be brutal.

Still a great game with lots of fun elements to it.  If you like optimizing games with a little logistics and special powers, the way that I do, well, you should check it out.

A classic euro game. I would say a classic Hans im Gluck game. Very good components, very beautiful artwork, some interaction between players and very intuitive rules. A good family game a bit complex for newbies.

It took a bit too much long than it should. I have to try it with more players and see if it's faster or not.

It plays faster with more players but if played with experienced players it also should play fast in a 2 player game. I think I'de like it better with more though.

After two plays, I found this a rather uninspiring, abstract Euro. A couple of additional plays with two improved my judgment. It's still a puzlle, but an interesting one, where other players' moves should impact your play. Playing with a random set-up helps, as you need to adjust your initial moves, which snowballs through the rest of the game. 

I'm still not entirely sure about the value of the action cards (they cost you a very valuable lackey, after all). But I'd like to explore them more, so I can definitely see this passing the 10 plays mark.

Medium-light worker placement with an area majority twist. I put it in the same mental category as Notre Dame: fun to play, but not the sort of thing I'll be telling stories about afterwards. Good in an inoffensively unexceptional way.

The random setup is interesting and it has that satisfying feeling of having too many good options. My biggest issues are with the four player game, which I think has the potential for a touch too much downtime and a little too much chaos on the noble board. The turn order advantage is not, I think, properly compensated by one measly coin.

All in all, a pleasant diversion that fits in under an hour.

Typical Euro game of collecting resources and converting them into VP. It does have some interesting twists with the action spaces being a different layout board each game. It isn't bad, but there is a ton of downtime in between players turns. It would go down the more you play the game, but even then I find it to be a pretty fatal flaw. Plus, a few of the special power cards are insane. Getting all your workers out and moving with +5 or +9 with that possibly happening on the 2nd turn could just snowball into an easy win. Some interesting mechanisms definitely, but not sure on the balance of the game.

Sort of a worker-placement game, but with some twists.  Some workers stay, others come and go.  You start with a lot of workers and it dwindles down, changing the game significantly.

RATING: 6.5
Has some fiddly elements, but overall combination is quite unique, and I'm unaware of other games like it. Interesting to have a worker placement game where there is still an element of movement required between locations, which adds an extra layer of strategy. What I don't like is how you can accidentally screw yourself over very easily be moving too many peasants out of the movement space early on (hence requiring many turns to do anything useful, including regaining lost movement). Also has the possibility of long wait times if players try to calculate exactly which nobles they can afford to enlist before placing their dudes.

First Play impression : Beautiful pieces.  Typical HiG quality.  It didn't take long for us to figure out the flow of the game.  It's good, not great but I think it will improve with plays.  The special noble tiles and cards are really important and we did not utilize them to our best advantage.  It's a lot of counting moves and there are a lot of points to be made.  It is hard to track points so I figure just getting those little advantages is what makes the leader pull ahead.  It might possibly be a race to be more efficient than the next guy.  We played 2 player and we tied!  I thought for sure my wife won but she concentrated on the area control aspect but those tiles had low points.  I grabbed big tiles and used at least 4-5 cards.  She was cash and movement rich most of the game so I concentrated on getting advantages. 

update : Wow.  What a difference another play makes.  I set up the board from what I hear is X.Georges original intent.  Low score, special ability tiles in the center and high scoring tiles on the edges.  It gave the game a better play arc.  We realize that was what was missing from this game.  This slight adjustment gave it the arc it needed to be better.  Not enough to take it to greatness and this is due to the constant calculating necessary to do well.  It's almost impossible to track the score but you can count your opponent's tiles to gauge your position somewhat.  We snatched up abilities early this time and had different powers through the game.  It was tough figuring out what put Jessica ahead (102-89) but she played well and used massive extra movements.  The park aspect ended up being a tie again.  Good game and time will tell if it has lasting power.

Now I see it (with XG setup): The random arrangement of palace tiles gives you insight on what noble power tiles to grab.  Movement management is key.  Cards are a great help to pull of power moves.  The scores stay close and it seems hard to truly get well ahead.  Grab as many tiles as you can.  The park can be a viable endgame point grab and can be a deciding factor. 

update : Played tonight with the completely random setup.  It made for a much tougher and dynamic game.  Hans im Gluck are good developers.  At least there a couple ways to play now.

My wife said it reminded her of Finca.

A very pleasant surprise. Potentially very AP prone and avoid playing this with people that like to analyse, but in the right group this plays in about an hour with 4 players and packs enough choices and variety in to it that I can give it a decent (if not great) recommendation.

Update: Rating down from 7.6 to 7.1. It's a shame that each turn is the same thing repeated and this gets pretty repetitive, even when I haven't played it in a while...

Found this to be most enjoyable, surprisingly so as I only bought it on a whim.  

Not played it with more than 2 player though and I suspect that it might become a bit cumbersome with 3 or 4.  Downtime would definitely be a problem with how me and Lucy enough our games

RATING: 8
Quite good, though with a bit too much, "What exactly can I afford to do this turn?" and very much, "What can I do now that the previous players have completely changed the state of the board?" Down time is completely down for at least the first two of three opponents.* Only once the immediately previous player is mostly through his turn can you plan with any degree of likelihood your plan will survive the remainder of his move. This isn't to say strategic considerations don't enter the game--they definitely do--but you opponents' moves often completely upset any specific plans. General plans are useful, but take little time to decide upon, while the specific, detailed steps to implement those plans can only be planned once the previous player is nearly done with his turn.

So, the downtime is very definitely down, and if one feels drawn to plan ahead too early, the game can be frustrating as these early plans are disrupted by each opponent in turn. The majority bonuses are nice player interaction, but the are also a major source of planning disruption.

Nice, modular board. Why isn't every board modular like this?

*I read the game summary, which seems to be at least conceptually lifted from the rules or box. The game is presented as a contest to gain majorities. This gaining of majorities on the "actions board" (as opposed to the "tiles board") is what changes the game state so much I, at least, can't plan ahead. However, using the "action board" as an engine to claim tiles (granting VPs, tile board majorities, and special powers) seems to me to be far more powerful--ignore action board majorities and optimize your tile claiming. I think perhaps the designer or publisher may have fallen into the mindset of winning "action board" majorities and slighted the superb "action board" tile engine part of the game.

J'aime bien ce jeu de majorité car on calcule les majorités à notre tour. Il nous revient donc de choisir les majorités qui sont importantes pour nous - et nos choix peuvent évoluer au cours de la partie. Je lui trouve une ressemblance avec Louis XIV (et pas seulement le thème).

Royal Palace is an interesting game that packs area majority, resource management, worker placement and movement, and a variable startup into a tight 60-minute package.  It is simple enough for new players to get a handle on the goals after one turn, but there is plenty of depth to reward experienced players.  A pleasant surprise.

Nice mechanic with the random layout of the rooms in the palace, and the movement of servants between them, forcing some tough decisions to be made on every turn, and making the game different every time around.

RATING: 7
I found Royal Palace to be interesting and challenging. The main quibble I have is that players taking the final turn or two are supremely in the catbird's seat. They can pick and choose from among tiles that become free (or nearly so) to play since so many other tiles have been taken, and can pretty much dictate the 6-point bonuses on the board. Going last is therefore a huge edge. But, there's far more that works well here than not, and Royal Palace is a game I'll gladly play just about any time.

RATING: 5
Royal Palace is a middleweight worker placement game with oddly incongruous artwork from Michael Menzel.  The game is similarly disjointed with some rules interacting seamlessly and others sticking a bit.  But my pet-peeve is moving back and forth endlessly between rooms, and Royal Palace has that in-spades.

Royal Palace (or Palais Royal) felt very familiar, maybe too familiar considering it’s a brand new game by a brand new designer (Xavier Georges). It didn’t feel precisely like any one German-style board game, but was surprisingly easy to grasp despite its fairly involved rules. This may have been due in part to the excellent teaching skills of Scott Tepper, but I think it’s also due to the fact that the game clearly recycles mechanics. That’s not necessarily a bad thing and I don’t mean it with any negative connotation. As I quoted in The Attia Family Tree, “Good poets borrow, great poets steal.” Borrowing is an integral part of any form of creation, whether it’s poetry or board game design. Recycling mechanics is a necessary process for refining mechanics and more fully exploring their possibilities and interactions with various themes and rule sets. The game that Royal Palace felt most like is Louis XIV, as Melissa Rogerson already observed in her blog Obsessing about Everything. Not only the theme, but also the mechanics of placing and moving cubes to attain pluralities in various regions that give special abilities felt like Rudiger Dorn’s Louis XIV. This is a good thing in my mind because I really enjoy Louis XIV, but this may be a turn off for many who find Louis XIV to be too dry and repetitive. I’m left feeling rather ambivalent about Royal Palace. I’d be happy to play it again in order to get a better sense for whether it’s worth purchasing and repeatedly playing, but I didn’t fall in love with it or feel a strong urge to play many more times. Hopefully someone else nearby will pick this one up so I can explore it a bit more before committing because it appeared to have some potential, but didn’t quite win me over.

Wasn't that impressed.  Think it's slightly broken with the 'place five anywhere' mechanic.  Player with experience knew where to place them for long-turn benefit (stairwell & the room that generates at the gate), took a good apparently lead we battled against to varying degrees.

Palace Royal is a game about moving servants to different rooms of a palace, which allows them to entice Nobles to come visit? I guess. Something like that.

You have servants and every servant in a particular room gives you the ability to do that room's power. So each servant on the stairway gives you a movement point, each servant on the gate let's you bring in a new servant, etc. If you have the most servants in a place you get a bonus one of whatever that is (usually). There's a communal field of nobles, which cost money and teal/purple seals. Those nobles also give you points or special powers. And if you take nobles from the edge of the board, it ties up your servant for the rest of the game, but contributes to a majority contest for points.

I really liked the way this game worked... at least until we played it. And then we ran into a small problem. There's a spot called the back door that lets you draw cards. And cards are very powerful. So two of the players went with a strategy of getting as many cards as possible. So much so that we emptied the entire deck. I had 13 guys at the backdoor at one point.

And with hands full of cards, we were set to have mega-turns. And when we realized that the empty deck guaranteed that we could redraw the cards we had just played, and thus be set to repeat our turn ad infinitum we called the game. Honestly, at that point, I was going to be doing most of my actions using cards, and it would matter very little what I would be doing with actual servants.

I wanted to like this game quite a bit. I still think there's a way to make it work with a house rule, but I'm not sure what would be best. A hand limit? A cost to playing additional cards akin to the cost of placing workers in Tzolk'in? Part of the problem was probably that the back door was adjacent to the gate... even house ruling that those needed to be opposite corners might have been enough to slow down the card strategy.

Many Euros will have you build up an engine to generate points and then have a short time at the end when you can get a ton of points each round. In Royal Palace, you spend a short amount of time getting some powers and then spend a long while getting a similar amount of points each turn, performing similar actions. There's little variety, and little fun. There's no interesting plays or anything, nearly everything you do is of very limited scope. I didn't really get much out of playing this.

RATING: 7
Palais Royal is primarily a game of majority. Each player has servants he will place appropriately on the nine parts of the palace. In his turn, a player will perform actions based on the number of servants available on each location. If he has for example three servants on the mint, he gets three pieces of gold. As a bonus, the player with the majority of servants on a location receives generally a bonus extra action.
Some places allow you to add new servants or to move them from room to room. The purpose is to earn gold and royal seals and to use those to recruit the lofty noblemen waiting in the castle park. The latter will be the main source of victory points at the end of the game.
Some noblemen benefits are that you can break the balance in the rooms of the palace and there are also cards with privileges, offering bonuses of the same nature that it is also possible to retain them in hand to score points.

Even though Palais Royal is a pretty dry and hardly original worker placement game, we all quite enjoyed our first play of it with four players.

I'm already not a huge fan of Georges designs. So this one struck out for me. My understanding is that this game is somewhat similar to Istanbul where worker placement and movement of workers on the board dictates resource allocation. It is fine, but feels a little aged. This is somewhat understandable since the game came out in 2008, more than 8 years ago. Still, the game feels a bit rote and dry. Playing with the prearranged setup with the gate in the middle, the game dragged. I cannot image if the gate is found on the edges of the board and meeples have to traverse the length to get to the king/queen/enlist noble tiles. This will make the game drag to no end. Like Gingkgopolis, Carson City and Troyes, I believe I am going to pass on Georges next design. I am just not his target audience.

We visited Versailles in 2009, so were naturally pre-disposed to liking this, but the game was very good too. The various locations work well, I really liked the decisions they required as to how, when, and why you'd move your various workers around to accomplish what you needed. Also, the way the scoring locations for the nobles lowers your worker supply down over time was neat.

By all rights, this game isn't terrible.  In fact, the lower part of the game board, where you manage what you want to do by moving around and removing your servants, is pretty damned interesting.  The rest of the game just seems a little bland and uninspired, to the point where it just feels like a cube-pusher of a game.  It has a small amount of randomness, but a high amount of chaos, to the point where the game becomes primarily tactical in the end.  It's interesting enough for me to play it again if it were introduced, but not enough for me to buy it, or even ask to play it if I even remembered it.

I've not played Carson City, but after Ginkopolis and the magnificent Troyes, reading the rules to Royal Palace affirmed that Xavier Georges is a super intelligent designer. This is a cheekily clever game, & to me, quite thematic as servants rush around the palace and grounds in order to do favours for nobles and win prestige for you, their master, who is naturally directing them all. With a modular board that predates Istanbul and Quantum (though naturally mechanising differently), this game really does look great.

I really did enjoy the game since it's a work placement game. Only probleme is how the rulebook explain the turns and the majority bonus wich seems totally non-sense.
As for the rule book, the player does his on his turn all the step so when comes the collect your "income" step you always have majority, so what good is for having a rule to get majority. Unless we misunderstood that rule, nor the rule plays better in a 4 player game, it does'nt make any sense in a 2 player game. As for rating the rulebook... My rate would go down to 5.

I was enamored with this game after my first game at Spiel 2008 in Essen and it has just grown on me since. This is definitely a game you should play at least 2-3 times before writing off.

The game looks great, plays quickly and you always face lots of tough options. It plays wonderfully well online at JSP, it is as if made for play-by-web.

My first nitpick is that the reference sheets are thin, dog-eared pieces of paper. I wish they would have printed them on the same nice cardboard as the palace tiles. The second that the insert sucks! You have to turn the box over to get the Palace Tiles out of it.

Otherwise the components are top quality, gorgeous, and feature great iconography. It only takes one game to master that. It does take more games to master how different each game is from the previous. The Palace layout changes, as does the Nobles used in each game, and where they're located.

Wonderful game that I don't think I will ever tire of playing. I look forward to some expansion Noble Tiles to further vary each game.

El Grande may be the patriarch of area control games but this is the poster child.  There are seven different actions per turn, and every single one of them is governed by area control, while three of them allow you to gain area control.

The nine-tile modular "board" provides beautiful variety in gameplay.  A very original game.

A lot of very cool mechanisms in this game, but much of your play must be tactical, awaiting your turn to find out the state of affairs.  As a result, the downtime is a little frustrating, since you can think about your strategy, but specific tactical plays are probably irrelevant until your turn.

After 1 Play: In a word, lifeless.

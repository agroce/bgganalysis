Possbly slightly too tactical for me to compare it to some of Feld's heavier designs but there is certainly plenty to think about and once again he has some great ideas on how to bring something just that little bit different to the table

This is a really good game, but I think that Concordia is the game I wanted this one to be. Despite the promise of engine building, it never really works out - there is too much luck needed and the card abilities are not synergistic. 

Still - the game mechanics are really good and the art is beautiful.

A really nice, beautiful and tactile game with simple mechanisms and stacks of options.  If you're a Feld fan like we are, you're probably going to like this one too.

The game revolves around a deck of 165 unique cards, 33 in each of five colours, many of which won't be used in any particular game.

Each round consists of:

•	All players draw cards from either of two piles to bring their hand to five.  You can see what colour card you're choosing, but you don't get to look at the faces until you've drawn all of them.  (The decks are held in neat slanted boxes that allow players to draw cards without accidentally revealing cards further down the deck)
•	The five dice are rolled, and Macao-style, affect all players and are used by all players.
•	In turn, each player plays a card until everyone has just one remaining (which will form the start of the next hand).

Because there are six things you could do with a given card, each action you choose means you miss out on five you could have chosen.  But despite the large number of combinations of options, we felt our goals remained pretty clear to us so the game didn't suffer from AP.

Players use their cards to do one of:

•	Build a building - by paying a worker of the matching colour, and placing the card face down into their play area
•	Recruit a person - by paying the cost in guilders for that person and placing the card face up on a building card
•	Build a section of canal - by playing a card of the required colour and paying guilders for the section built
•	Obtain two workers - by discarding a card of a matching colour to the workers
•	Obtain some guilders - by discarding the card and taking a number of guilders equal to the die roll of that colour
•	Removing one threat marker - by discarding a card of a matching colour to the threat (threat markers are given to all players as a result of the dice rolls.  They're a mechanism to potentially disrupt plans and give the players something more to worry about)

Lots of ways to earn victory points, and many possible routes.

If it helps you decide whether you'd like Bruges, of the Feld games we have played, this is currently our order of preference:

Castles of Burgundy, Notre Dame, Bruges, Trajan, Macao, Rialto.

Prototypical Feld, on the lighter end of his scale, this is a "point-salad" game with an element of punitive measures thrown in.  Theme?  Forget it, non-existent, but it scales very well from 2-4 players, it has nice artwork, and it's easy breezy to learn and play a game (or two).

The goal of the game is to score the most points before game end, which is somewhat variable (game enters the end phase when one of the draw decks runs out).  At the start of each round, the dice are rolled and allocated (a new hallmark of Feld games it to make innovative use of dice, and it occurs once again although to a lesser and minor extent in this game)- the dice, which are coloured and correspond to the colours of character cards, dictate the values of money for the round, and the type of penalty, if any for that round.  Then you can choose, in turn order, to advance on the prestige track (this is one of several ways to score points), keeping in mind that this costs money and money is very tight but it also can potentially give you an opportunity for a "leading category" point score (another way to score points).  

You then draw a set hand of cards of which you will play all but one, and you see the colour (this corresponds to dice actions/costs), but not the effect- you also can draw from 2 different piles and have some control over the speed/length of the game.  On your turn, you play a card to activate an action, which of course is generally colour limited: a) get money (refer to the die pips of that colour), b) build a house, which requires a worker of that colour (another way to score points and is required to house workers, think "In the Year of the Dragon"), c) play a personality card, which requires money, is another way to score points and gives benefits some immediate, some reusable (this is the part that can be frustrating if you can't get any card synergy), d) fight an event (scores small points and avoids pain), e) collect workers (colour determined), f) build canals, which is colour limited, requires money, and scores points.

At the end of the round, you survey the lay of the land and can score points for having a majority in: a) prestige track, b) workers housed, c) canals built.  These points are significant but can only be scored once each.

This is a solid game effort, but it can be a bit off-putting as many of the card actions are "take-that" in nature, the card draws can be frustrating, and the events can be punitive and while you can work to mitigate them, you can really only do this if you can get those card colours, which *shouldn't* be hard, but sometimes can be.  It does scale well, plays quick, and is easy to learn.  I wouldn't be surprised (or disappointed really) if this wins the fluff SdJ award.

A great Feld game with all his hallmarks - punishing events constantly threaten to destroy your plans, victory points can be picked up in all manner of ways ("point salad"). There are a huge number of card combinations available, which sets this game a little ahead of the similar feeling Notre Dame. It looks nice too. One of Feld's best.

I was a bit disappointed with my first play of this game.  I'm a big fan of Stefan Feld and usually find his games interesting mechanically, but this one didn't feel like it brought anything new to the table.  It feels similar to any number of other tableau building card games out there, like Race for the Galaxy, San Juan, Innovation or Seasons.  The use of the board is minimal and doesn't really add much to the game.  It didn't help that in our game I got a strong card early on that pretty much dictated what strategy I would follow and led to an easy win by a wide margin.

I'd definitely like to play it again to see if my opinion changes, but for now, this definitely seems the weakest of Feld's 2013 releases.

UPDATE 8/12/14: My second play was more fun and had a much closer result.  I still feel like there's not a lot innovative about the game, but it has good fun factor and is on the shorter end of the Feld scale in terms of playing time.

RATING: 5
The good: The mechanics salad is better integrated here than in other Feld games. 

The Bad: It is a random and 100% tactical game and also a bit long for what it is. It's too repetitive, and get's boring near the end.

Fucking Bruges... Easily one of my favorite Stefan Feld games. Bruge's brings together one of this generations great euro game designers with Michael Menzel, the artist who also did the legends of Andor board. The outcome is a great game with interesting mechanics that you can hang on the wall when you aren't playing it. It is not like many of Feld's games yet it is still clearly a high watermark in game design for Feld. Fucking Bruges...

Loved my first game of Bruges.  Played without the underworld characters, just cause we thought it would be nice to go without them.

Added in the underworld characters which don't seem to hurt other people greatly or at all really.  Only real issue I have with the game is setup time needed for the cards. Since you need to split the deck into 5 stacks (or 6 if you are using the expansion). This is the longest portion of setup and the only real turn off I get from the game.  Beyond that everyone seems to run the same strategy most of the time.  Have to play by the seat of your pants to have a chance in this game.  Of course lucky draws are real killers in this game also.

+ Tons of different and interesting cards; Finding the right combinations of actions and cards is very tense.
- The majorities are seemingly too easy to hold on to; I thought there'd be more jockeying for them.


Why it's previously-owned:
For a card/hand-management game, there are just too many others that present "cooler" combos as well as a much more engaging theme.  
This got traded away for a bunch of LOTR: LCG stuff.

RATING: 9.06
Abstract:
A multi-used card board game by Stefan Feld. There are cards and dice for each of the 5 colors. At the start of each round, all dice are rolled and each player draws up to 5 cards. Threat tokens are distributed depending on the rolled dice. Each player may pay money to advance on the reputation track. Turn-wise, each player plays a card (up to 4).

Possible card actions:
a) get money (depending on pips of the same colored die)
b) get henchmen (depending on pips of the same colored die)
c) discard one threat token (of the same color)
d) build a house (and discard a henchman of the same color)
e) build a canal (discard a card of the same color and pay money)
f) place a card (in an empty house and pay money)

Pros:
+ Multi-used cards combined with dice(!)
+ Mitigation of randomness is a big part of the game
+ Choosing colored cards from two separate decks sounds insignificant, but it actually is important to keep one's options open
+ Indirect player interaction by racing for majority markers is brilliant
+ Big amount of cards and all of them are unique (however, most differ slightly)
+ Engine building is fun and different each game
+ Good mix between tactical game (decision-making on a round-basis) and strategical game (engine-building, money management, henchmen management, threat management, and keeping one card for the next round)
+ Threat management (push your luck)
+ Theme is quite well integrated (compared to other games by Stefan Feld)
+ Plays well with all player counts (more competition but also down-time on higher player counts)
+ Nearly family-friendly (it is a gateway plus game)
+ Quick set-up
+ Quick game
+ Easy to teach

Neutrals:
# Artwork is okay
# Scoring happens during the round, between rounds, and at the end of the game

Cons:
- Lucky (last round) draws are possible (but evens out over the course of the game)
- Most of the player interaction is of take-that variety (but the number of take-that cards is rather low)

Thoughts:
I love the combination of multi-used cards and dice in Bruges. The game offers a lot of new and interesting decisions each round. Randomness, and how to mitigate it, is a big part of the game. Compared to other Stefan Feld games, Bruges is a rather quick and "light" game, but still deep. 
Note: Bruges is one of few games by Stefan Feld that got a proper expansion.

Similar games:
* Glory to Rome, Oh My Goods, Race for the Galaxy, San Juan (because of multi-used cards)

Player: 2-4 (5 with expansion) (best: 3-4) | Time: 60m

I accidentally played a Feld.

Bijan's arsonist (aka take a red token) strategy failed to stop me winning with some combination of soulless, ugly cards. 

The company was good and the actual game elements here have great potential; mainly because the cards enjoy a myriad of possibilities and you therefore have a lot of control... but the theme and execution of Bruges is so incredibly dull even the surprisingly prevalent dickery just comes down to adding three blue things together and losing one of your tokens or points.

And don't say "ooh, but canals are totally Bruges" - you could set this game in Birmingham and have the little "reputation" meeples walk up New Street towards the bullring or something. If you don't think those canals count, you could just replace them with endless, pointless roadworks and you're finished.
You'd probably have to update the card art for some of the tedious old timey individuals on them so they instead show some tedious modern people, but the game would be identical. 

Yeah, there you go, publisher of this game - there's a challenge for you: create a game unique to a British town or city that couldn't just be moved to a Belgian city with a slight facelift. Maybe base it on Slough? 

Yeah, Slough: The Boardgame. 
Use multi purpose cards with pictures of roadsigns on in order to spend pointless "effort" cubes to drag yourself to an industrial estate and then move around an endless ringroad and occasionally attempt suicide. That's Slough, The Boardgame. 
It could have a "Crushing Ennui" track. 
You could put David Brent on the box, because that's all anyone bloody knows about Slough, isn't it? Slough.

In the future dystopian society we face following the inevitable rise of Pan-European statehood*, a terrifying nanny state will force all games to be produced in packages as terrifyingly and soul crushingly bland as Bruges, lest imagination and excitement at a theme lead to a popular uprising against their authoritarian masters.

TLDR: I liked it more than I expected, to be honest.

Only played once for now - after that we bought our copy.
Like different options for using cards and the fact that there is only so much of them - you can easily go through and search for available ones.

At last, we tried Bruges with its expansion. For now, I cannot undestand how to play it - everything is too random and I can't find synergy between resources. Serge is seem to manage it much easier.

по чтению правил мозг взрывался - было совершенно не понятно, на каких задротов это всё рассчитано, как этот жуткий винегрет вообще можно уместить в голове. 

но вот начинается первый ход, и буквально тут же с характерным щелчком всё встаёт на свои места, и игра идёт практически без листания правил. 

о какой-то мало-мальски стратегии можно будет говорить, наверное, только после минимального изучения всех карт, но и без неё довольно увлекательно :)

The Master has done it again! No, no, not Stefan Feld; Michael Menzel. This is probably the most beautiful example of his artwork yet. Somehow, though, the art, which portrays Bruges in the 15th century, ended up in a game which has nothing to do with Bruges in the 15th century. Hmmm: even the game is called "Bruges". Strange. Must have been some mix up at the packing plant.

Speaking of art, the only negative is that the purple and brown colours are very hard to distinguish. I think it would be impossible for a colour-blind person to play this well.

Mechanically speaking, Bruges is near flawless. There is just enough luck in it to keep it from being dull. Additionally, in most games like this, the person who has memorized the cards has a decided advantage. But memorizing the cards is kinda pointless, since not all the cards will be used in a game. That ensures a high level of re-playability. As well, you can see the end of the game approaching as the card decks shrink, so that keeps a good level of tension.

However, it is multi-player solitaire; and (possibly due to the joke of a theme; and we literally were making jokes about it as we played!) it just doesn't grab me. Mind you, the only Stefan Feld game that did grab me was Macao, so take my rating with a grain of salt!

Only a single play, but I'm enjoying the wealth of options available. 

The game plays itself a bit, what with the randomness of the cards (common complaint), but it doesn't overstay its welcome and has a lot of replayability. 

Per the "plays itself a bit" comment, what I mean is you inflexibly have to play 4 cards in a round, so if you're down to two cards, you're prevented from holding back if you like both options. This, to me, feels like the game is forcing you into an action, which is why I use the expression above. Thankfully, there are enough things one wants to do (mitigate threat, build canals, generate money, etc) that it hasn't been much of a problem. 

Expansion owned but still unplayed. 

-- 12/30/14 (7.5 then)

7/11/17 Update (5.5 downgrade):

Three years later, I have many plays of this under my belt. For whatever reason I don't wish to edit my original commentary, there is something refreshingly pure about that naive perspective, but suffice to say my opinion of both the core game and expansion has come down a notch. Largely this is due to the wildly random nature of the card draw. If I can't be too put out due to a loss ("oh well, I never got that blue I needed") then I can't get too excited about a win either. Milk meet toast.  

The expansion is module based, but only the boats and cards are a positive addition.

The engine of Bruges is a big deck of character cards and the multiple things you can do with those cards.  The dice in the game serve to modify judgements about what's best to do with each colour of card each round. As ever with Feld, there are multiple ways to score.  

The luck of the card draw and of those dice seems significant.  Sometimes card combos will fall into place and at others they won't.  Sure you can change your plan, make the best possible use of the five cards in your hand, but still you're trailing the player with better luck.  

For the most part you are building your own tableau and digging your own canals.  There are, however, a few cards that impact on opponents.  The three bonus tiles are an odd feature.  Their bonuses often seem to be collected early and then tied positions or an inability to progress result in little or no change.  

Games of Bruges can come to an abrupt end before there has been much development.  By the same token, the game is light and quick and I found some degree of fun in it.

Production quality is to Hans im Gluck and Z-Man's best standards.  I found the artwork quite pleasing and evocative.

A "7" is not a bad score, but it really hurt for me to enter it. I was expecting to adore this game. Instead it is just quite good for me. It certainly plays like a Feld, but in a way it felt too easy to juggle the VP sources. I was expecting an impossible puzzle that would give me so many cool options that a few would fall by the wayside. Instead I had an easy time getting the most out of my cards. The game is definitely good, and I have wanted it for so long that I will play it more to see if my opinion changes, but for right now it's tragically "middle of the pack."

Yet another Stefan Feld game and I think that with this one I completed my campaign of playing every Feld game made after 2010. This one feels less re-engineered than Amerigo, it has the fun factor and plays nicely overall, with players having enough choices for the game to be interesting but not too many so that casual gamers can enjoy.

The characters represent the interesting part of the game and while they bring interesting abilities, they are not balanced. I won my first game by chance, drawing a character which score alone 16 VP (4 from on its own and 12 from the ability). This is something unexpected and a quite disappointing. Also, there are several characters with specific abilities which give a huge advantage in the beginning of the game.

I believe that between player who know the game the difference is made by the lucky draw of characters rather than superior strategy.

Working placement game together with hand management and dice rolling.

All actions are for the concentration of Fame , the most famous trader wins the game .

I won't be paying for this but I enjoyed my time with the game. Playing the cards for different effects is an excellent mechanics and the "everything gets points lol" design actually works here.

Neat game with a few different ways to try and win and some tough choices. Canal actions are not as attractive when compared to other possibilities unless there's really nothing else to do. Thankfully that has been addressed in the City on the Zwin expansion.

This is a keeper. We're just getting into Eurogames really but this is one of the best. And from Feld no less. There honestly aren't too many of his games we'll enjoy. It's simple and direct. You get a few decisions to make with a hand of cards you've drawn. It is easy and flows very well. No point salad either. Plays in under an hour and is just fun.

Initial rating is 7.  Only played about 3/4 of a game (missed the first 1/4).

Similar to Notre Dame in the sense that there are threats that keep on knocking at you, but luckily they are less prevealent and the threats "clear" after they hit, instead of the rats which can absolutely destroy you.

I do miss the drafting mechanism, and find that the random draw/selection to be a bit dissatisfying when compared to Notre Dame, especially when you just get a bad string of cards that are available.

However, these are really critical things of Feld, as his designers are top notch.  

Upgraded from 7 to an 8 after first full play.

Elegant, beautiful game, one of Feld's very best, I'd place it somewhere between Trajan and Castles of Burgundy. I love how the cards can be used for normal actions, or Houses, or Persons to house in those houses, which will give you variable abilities throughout the game. The board is colorful, mechanics intuitive and simple, and while it may be considered a 'lighter Feld', that is in no way a negative connotation for me, since it's a game that can be enjoyed again and again, and still gives me a similar feel to some of his heavier designs. The dice and threat tokens lend it a little bit of a Troyes feeling.

I like the mechanics and feel of this relatively lightweight game. Might turn out very samey after just a few plays, despite the relatively large amount of distinct characters, in which case my rating would probably decrease. Also feels pretty dry, which doesn't bother me, but might turn off some people. Bad luck seems to be something you can mostly mitigate, but it's still quite frustrating when you need a certain card color, and it's just not coming up for the draw. I fear that drawing amazing combos early on can really give you an unfair advantage, which would also be a reason for decreasing my rating - but so far I've not yet seen that happen, so not taking it into account.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
For most of the game I thought it excellent, and then I got very unlucky with two rounds of card drawing (ending up with a handful of identically-coloured cards is *not* a good plan), and the game spiralled away at that point.  Towards the end, people had a tableau of cards that could work together quite effectively, but this sort of exercise slows the game down while everyone works out the best options.  So near-miss, but too fiddly.

Felt as if Stefan Feld was still being influenced by Stefan Brück, as players are confronted with a steady flow of negatives to deal with, rather than the more friendly HiG style.  Whilst I prefer games to be constructive, Bruges handles the negatives well as you can generally see them coming and choose to avoid them, at a cost, if you wish.  The double lightning bolt card proved a game winner on  this occasion.  But enough going on to warrant further plays.

Feld's successful take on the "Race for the Galaxy" style Tableau builder.  There is a stronger focus on economics than other games of the same type and like any card game you can be undone by card selections with no synergy. 

The game's theme wont inspire most people, but there art is quite nice.  There are a TON of cards in this game and each one has a unique portrait on it which is impressive. 

Overall I found it to be really satisfying.  There is a lot of variety in the gameplay and plenty of interesting decisions to mull over.

Ezt a jobbféle Feldek közé sorolnám, a régebbi játékait idézi eredetiségében. Ami viszont zavart, az a sok szöveges kártya, majdnem annyit kellett böngészgetni őket, mint a Macaoban. Az is egy szuper játék, csak kicsit azt is megöli a sok kártya. Ráadásul ezt német példánnyal játszottunk (bár a játék mellett szól, hogy német tudás nélkül is nagyjából érteni lehet). Amúgy ezt lesztámítva tetszik! Könnyed, pörgős, 1-2 órás, és bár a szerencsefaktor elég keményen jelen van, (nagyon nagy szórás van a kártyák közt ár-érték arányukat tekintve, és a kockadobáson is sok múlhat), szerintem belefér. Minden Feld rajongónak kötelező!!

A typical Feldian game ... A great idea with eight layers of scoring crap piled on. If you like his games, you'll like this one, too.

However, I like this one more than most of his because I think it starts off relatively calm and adds more and more things (unlike Bora Bora, say).

Still, after two plays I feel no strong urge to play it again.

The third Feld opus of 2013 I tried, after the great Bora Bora and the light Rialto, is another excellent game, again in the lighter side of the canon. I guess this can easily be compared to Notre Dame.

The game plays really fast (you can play a 2-player game in half a hour), and has a fair share of luck in card drawing (particularly if you draw, or don't draw, the right string of colors), but this has not been a problem so far: the 165 unique cards make the game's replayability very high, and the short duration makes the luck tolerable.

The game is very feldian, as one might expect: different ways to score points, clever and different use of dice, lots of interesting decisions. Everything packed in a very simple package, that could appeal even to non hardcore gamers.

After playing Castles of Burgundy I just had to try out another Stephan Feld game.

This game makes all the right noises but sadly fails to deliver like CoB does. 

For starters its too short. Just as you get your engine going the game ends so the people you have never really feel like they are making an impact.

I also found that the threats are never really that impacting and in some instances are actually welcomed to clear out the deadwood.

It's not a bad game at all just didn't really hit the spot or have any real strategy, tactics or tension so sold on Geekmarket.

For a Feld game, this is a rather friendly game. Here, you don't come short of everything and you manage most things. Sometimes you don't get the right colour or the dice doesn't roll in your advantage, but it isn't constantly hamstering like in some of his other games.

Bruges is a great game.  It is a multi-use card game in which cards can be used in 6 different ways althought only for one use does the card have any significance other than its colour.  Like Race for the Galaxy there is a lot of randomness in the game but the winning player will probably be the player who best utilised their opportunities whilst mitigating their risks the best.  Its really easy to teach and learn and is a lot of fun.  Need more games to compare it with other Felds.  It shares a lot with Macao in that each utilise cards and dice in similar and interesting ways although Macao is more about the dice and this is more about the cards.  For a lot of gamers this will be way too random but with its quick playing time, large number of interesting decisions and ways of countering the randomness make it shine for me.

It's a Feld point salad, with a fair bit going on.. but it's not as ridiculous as some.  Mostly card-driven, with a unique use of dice thrown in.

First play: just overwhelmed by the chaos and luck. 
Need a colour but that card doesn't come up = trouble. The colour cards you do draw correspond to low dice = Limited cash = trouble.
Your cards have mediocre/ weak abilities = trouble.
In our game one player was languishing and could just concentrate on canals. He then drew the character that gives 2 points per canal section and scored double our points at end game. Options and success are utterly driven by the card draw and players are little more than passengers driven to where the cards take them.

A truly impoverished relative of Felds other offerings. A very poor game with no redeeming features. My score of 4 is generous and should really be a 3. In fact lets make it a 3.

A deck of unique cards and an array of choices typical of Feld games.  Beautiful artwork.  The randomness of the cards requires players to approach the game as a tactical game. Approach it as a strategic game and you will only be frustrated and disappointed. You have to remain flexible and react to the characters you encounter each game.  More enjoyable after some experience and familiarity of cards and possible interactions.

I'm definitely losing patience with Feld games.  This really feels like a Feld tableau building game and that's not a good thing.

Got it as the birthday present for 2013 from Q. 

Bruges reminds me of Notre Dame and those "old-fashioned" board games that I played when I just got into this hobby 3 years back. It has a very solid/clear core that experienced players could get a hang of it quickly, for that I think it streamlined very well. It's a good lighthearted and well-balanced game for casual players, too.

I felt it inherited a bit more from Macao, maybe just because the using of dice and the various cards. Though I dislike Macao, I like Bruges and quite enjoy it very much. An elegant game full of Feld's style.

The dry Bruges is a textbook example of the eurogames’ golden rule: when playing, you’re allowed to take some actions but never the ones you’d really need, insomuch that you quickly feel like you’re panting a few moves behind. 

Everything in the game is made to glorify rules, mechanisms and optimization above everything else, leaving no room for the the warm, human rewards of a little theme, jokes or even chit-chatting. 

It’s like the authors were saying: You’re playing my game and that’s a deadly serious matter, son! How would you belittle it by adding a little light-heartedness?

Initial Impressions:
----------------------
One of my favorite mechanisms is using cards for multiple purposes, and this is Feld's take on that!  Wow, this one was really fun.  For a game that is not very complex, this one seems to offer a good amount of tough choices.  The game is also beautiful, with every card having unique art?  Are you kidding me?  Seems like it would play best with 3 or 4, but it was fun with even 2.  I need to explore more, but there seems like a ton of paths to go, but will need time to determine that.  This one looks like a keeper, and I am very much looking to trying it at other player counts.

Update - This one doesn't stand up over time.  It's got some nice elements, but none of them gel to form anything fun.  I like the role cards and how they're used for different things.  I don't like how there are so many different scoring options.  Point salad is for pussies.

Feld takes the "multiple uses of cards" thing to the Nth degree, with 6 distinct things each card can be used for. Set up card combos the best you can, but the luck involved means planning multiple turns ahead probably won't work. But, Im ok with that. It frees me to worry about this turn. Feels about as complex as Strasbourg, and presumably Rialto, rather than Bora Bora, Trajan, Macao or Burgundy.

Well, what can I say, I'm a Feld Fanboy.  Anyways, this game, thankfully, felt different than Bora Bora/Trajan/CoB.  Maybe it's the cards?  But I really enjoyed this one as it reminded me of Luna in the aspect that it really feels wide open on what you can do.  A slight mashup of Louis XIV and Luna.  :)

It might be me but I'm finding I could almost live off a complete diet of Feld games.

I thought I should look into getting a Feld game and after some deliberating decided this would be it. It has quickly become a favorite. I’ve played a half-dozen games already which is a lot for how many plays we’ve been getting in around real life. I like the way you can plan a bit for your next round based on the color of cards that you draw but then may need to adjust based on the dice roll. The characters and abilities are interesting and there are a good number of decisions to be made. So far most of the games I’ve played have been two-player with my wife and we both really like it. We did play a four-player game last night and it went equally well.

Unlike the usual offering from Feld, this is a light card based game that has plenty of tactical options.

It's tough to weight the gameplay, since it's mediumish, but figuring out what to do is definitely not. I really enjoyed the game. It's a euro game with a lot of screw-em-over tactics thrown in, which is refreshing. One player can play a card or do something that causes the rest of the players to gain some sort of problem. What I liked about this, was that I didn't see any cards that allowed the player to choose which player, it always seemed to be all other players. I also find the problems in this game are predictable to some degree, which means you can attempt to prepare for them. My biggest gripe with the game is it's reliance on chance, the game I played had a ton of 5 and 6's show, which made for a game very focused on getting rid of threat markers. I think I'd like the game just a bit more if it were only the 6's that gave threat markers. Definitely worth checking out.

A rather chaotic and very luck-based game. Card drawing can be lucky or unlucky in many ways. Dice rolling give luck even more importance, as they are also connected to cards you have drawn. You can get attacked by another player, sometimes without chances to foresee it or defend anyhow. It seems smooth, but at the same time it has many little rules you have to keep in mind and it's very easy to make a mistake. Finally, final scoring takes a lot of things into consideration - you never know who is a leader and loser before you count everything.

I'm a Feld fan so take this with a grain of salt.  Brugge is a fun game and very "Feld-y"(tm) in feel.  I love the use of cards for multiple effects in a similar way to CDGs from wargame titles.  However I think the biggest appeal of the game is the playtime.  A Feld fix in under an hour?  I'll take it!  Definitely his best effort of 2013.

Graveur card to strong in early game and the canals are unnecessary. The player who knows the card-deck best has a big advantage in the first two games.
It goes much better with the expansion,
but somtimes often take that action, where all goes down the canal.

RATING: 8
Light to midweight card game with cards allowing multiple actions.  Luck is nicely mitigated by the colors of cards being on the backs and the two draw piles.  There's almost always something useful to do with your cards.  Somewhat tactical as you'll need to adapt to the cards you get.  Trying to find some synergy between cards reminds of the feel of strategizing the occupations and improvements in the gric.  All the elements the game, dice, threats, canals, etc., come together nicely.  The game plays very quickly with short actions and not much downtime.  Very good game overall.

A bit disappointment, perhaps i had too many expectations by the union of my fav designer and my fav publisher.
Combo card game is not a type of game i enjoy too much.Still the game is easy to explain and fast to play.A bit difficult to follow other plan.All in all a good game, not great and behind the other feld games of this year (other too)

Update 08.05.2014: this game is growing on me play after play.Combo game are not my fav type but in this one the turn are fast, play is smooth and there are a lot of different way and intelligent play that you can go.Waiting for the expansion to see if it improves the game a little more.

update 02.08.2014: keep on growing...raise toa  full 9

RATING: N/A
Bruges has many of Feld's hallmark mechanisms - multi-use cards, lots of ways to score points, valuation that changes over time, and random punishments that must be avoided.  The cards are at the heart of Bruges, and they can be used in 5 (or 6?) different ways. When drawing cards, you have 2 piles to pick from, and the card backs show the card color, which gives a small measure of control, since the color matters for about 3 of the ways you might play a card.  

The game quickly devolves into an exercise of triage - look through your hand and decide which cards you must play this round for certain things, then decide how you will play the other cards to support this.  For example, you might decide that 2 of your cards have people on them (which grant special abilities) that are crucial to your strategy.  You will then want to allocate 2 cards you don't need toward building houses for those people, so you need to figure out which 2 cards are your least needed.  Repeat as necessary.

Our first play of Bruges was rather lackluster.  My wife ran away with it after getting a particularly nice combo of people cards.  I think that more experience might mitigate this, but it still seems likely to happen regularly.  Ultimately, it did not grab us and we failed to return to it because there were always options we wanted to play more.  Eventually I traded it away.

I think those who like optimization puzzles will like Bruges, particularly if you like building combos.

Solid Euro-esque game. There are definite multiple strategy paths here that I like, but the cards seem to be a bit of an imbalance. If you get the right Person played early in the game it gives a huge advantage. Still, fairly quick game for the amount of depth it has. Like many Euros, the art and theme are only average.

Hmmmm I feel very mixed on Bruges.

On the one hand it's fun thinking through the options in front of me and how to use my hand of cards. BUT on the other hand it feels just a little too 'random' for me. When I lose I look back at my turns and I'm not sure what I would have done differently. Sometimes I get the cards I need and sometimes I don't :/

And yet I have fun while playing it and my wife likes it so it's stuck around and will probably be played soon :)

I'd say that this is a rather typical Feld game with lots of familiar mechanisms married together in a quite interesting way.

Wonderful game. I was trying to resist becoming yet another Feld fanboy, but this once clinches it. So many interesting choices, so many things to do on your turn, none of them ideal but all helpful in different ways. The card-drawing mechanic is very original, and the fact that all 165 cards are unique means that every game is going to be totally different, with a different money/building/worker/character/VP engine every single time you play. Awesome!

:thumbsup: [b]POSITIVE POINTS:[/b]

++ Great, light-medium weight multi-uses card tactical point-salad game with smooth gameplay.
++ Great card graphic design, that is clean and clear.
++ The game have "Threat Tokens" that are randomly generated by the dice of each turn that affect all players' short-term strategy (These are actually just a third of the threat, the threat being effective only when you have all 3 third threat tokens, and thus we can see these threats coming and can either counter them or mitigate their effect).
++ Good replayability from the fact that each game use just a part of all the cards, the variable card draw order and also because of the multi-uses cards.
++ There is one expansion available for this game (which is useful to refresh the game when we have overplayed it... but unfortunately, it's so hard to find!).
++ Great aesthetics!


:thumbsdown: [b]NEGATIVE POINTS:[/b]

-- Really good 2-players game, but probably better at 3-4 players, as some people cards have better effect at higher player number.
-- The game is more luck-based than I would like, thus you have to have a more tactical mindset when approaching this game (as you will not do what you want to do, but what you can do with the card you get).

RATING: 10
The usual Feld points salad format, but this time, with a whole bunch of characters that give special abilities mixed in!

While I'm not generally a huge fan of tons of special abilities, the ones used here are easy to manage and while there's some combos that work well together, it doesn't become a ridiculous exercise in tracking character abilities since you'll likely only have a few at your disposal at any given time.

As is fairly typical for Feld, he also finds a neat way to integrate dice that doesn't feel super dicey.  The dice dictate the flow of bad events that will happen to players, as well as dictate how easy or difficult it will be to get money.

In the end, some Feld fans may feel there is too much randomness in the card draw and the dice rolls, taking some control out of players hands.  However, I really enjoyed the unpredictability these elements had, rolling with the punches as I tried to execute a strategy.

*Note: This game is only a 10 when played with the expansion, which fixes canal building into something that is actually worthwhile.  Canal building is nearly always a losing strategy without it.  I'd still rate the game an 8 without the expansion, but it really completes the game into what it should have been to begin with.

I always enjoy a game with multiple paths to victory. It really worked for me. We were all so close in score, and makes you want to come back for more, because you feel you could improve just slightly next time. But on repeat plays we would all be looking out for little things like that. Always something to do on your turn. And that nice little element of "Can I just get one more turn to do something right now!"  There is a lot of luck needed on the cards you drew, and felt like this was more of a limiting factor than the dice were.  In fact, the dice were kind of really interesting to me.

I wouldn't mind playing this again, although I don't feel it is an instabuy for me.  There are other games I would gladly get to the table with my family and friends.

RATING: 4
For me, this games biggest flaw is that it's harmless, everything works together, but when I lay down cards with special powers, I want something cool to happen. Or, once I lay down five or six cards, I want to see some cool combo happening.

Now, I'm sure people who play the game frequently, will occasionally see something cool happening, but considering there are games that I can see cool things happen every time I play due to the cards with special powers (think games like Innovation), I'm not sure why I should ever play this one again.

I found there to be very little control. I don't at all mind screwage in games, but it feels very inappropriate in a game that is begging you to plan things out. There is no control over what colors you draw which is another frustrating aspect of the game. So many moves feel like running in place here too. Building houses is a bizarre and seemingly unnecessary step in building up your engine. Not for me.

I’m not a huge Feld fan, but I like CoB and Trajan quite a bit as well as Bora Bora. However, I think Feld makes a lot of average games: Speicherstadt, Macao, Notre Dame etc. all fell flat, and Brügge does too. It’s not a bad game; it’s just not particularly good either… It lacks interesting decisions and tension.

Brügge is not the typical point salad game which Feld has become famous (or feared…) for, but the point scoring still feels very uninspiring. You get some points for moving up on the track, for building canals and for the persons you hire. Meh. These persons vary a lot in strength and usability, but my biggest gripe is probably that you cannot really make a definitive strategy as you don’t know which cards you’ll be getting later in the game, so it’s a little hard to make those good card combos which will win you the game! You only keep a single card from round to round, so planning ahead is difficult. The best mechanism in Brügge is the disasters; they add some tension and relatively important decision making to the game, and there are some mean cards which the other players can play to make you get the last piece for the disaster to happen (you need 3 before the disaster strikes) – this can be very crippling, but I guess you just have to take it into account, so it’s definitely not a negative point.

The artwork is nice (though perhaps slightly too brown for my taste), so why did they choose to make the game board so small? And now that they chose this, then why did they choose to make the box so relatively big? Oh well, that’s not a complaint about the game, it just bugs me; it could easily fit in a Speicherstadt sized box or even a smaller one.

I absolutely love the use of cards in this game. Multiple  uses for cards has got to be my favorite and Bruges does it so well, lots of tough choices. I'm a little concerned with the card draw because it makes planning a struggle, but having cards with multi uses mitigates that somewhat. Also, there is a vast variety of cards so every game is going to be different. I've played with all player counts and have enjoyed every game played.

RATING: 7.9
Bruges is one of my favorite games, not only it's a Feld's game, the replendent cards and game boards design, improvised strategy planning, tense dice scenarios, etc. Though Bruges shares the same problem of all card-driven games: random card drawing, but the randomness does not affect the game significantly, instead Bruges is well-balanced between strategy depth and randomness.

Many people - include some of my friends - thinks Bruges is a bad-designed strategy game: players can't really make any long-term strategy due to the randomness of card drawing, which rise the pain index of strategy planning. In my opinion Bruges is a typical Feld's game which does not encourage players to focus on single strategy developement. Player need to realize Bruges is a resource-exchanging game which require players to consider: based on current dice rolls, how to optimize the cards I just draw to gain more points, which action to choose for each card to perform best usage, that strategy struggle is the essence of Bruges.  The player's plan should mainly focus on "current turn", adaptive players are always rewarded greatly while stubborn players find themselves stuck in the dead end. But I also think Bruges is a game with long-term strategies, reflect on "which card to keep to the next turn" and "which color of cards to choose": why choose these cards? why choose these colors? what's their future benefit. Player still need to come out a long-term plan to achieve victory.

The cost efficiency of the 2nd canal is broken in the base game, however the problem is improved in the expansion, the motivation lack of building canal is well compensated by the ships.(although i think some of the abilities are broken as well, i.e. extra action and the prestige track+1)

Overall, Bruges is a very enjoyable strategy game, your still suffer from bad draws or poor dice rolls, but they are not the end of the world. An improvised player always get great return. Bruges has all the key elements of Feld's game: various strategy paths, appropriate randomness, with very weak thematic (I still can't convince myself that every character is related to the ability instead of randomly matched). If you are a Stefan Feld's fan, can tolerate moderate strategy randomness, Bruges will be a great choice. If you like long-term planning, like to accomplish your plan step by step, you can always play Trajan or Puerto Rico.

Pros:
+Encourage improvisation in strategies.
+Beautiful art design.
+Cards/dices/colors-driven mechanics are amazing.
Cons: 
- Lack of theme.
- Moderate Randomness.

(Highly recommend playing with the expansion)

I like this game and having the text on the cards allows me to enjoy this more than CoB and always referencing the rules. In a strange way I find this game much like Seasons but I like it more. Seasons seemed like a race to get as many cards out as possible, here you don't need to get out as many cards and the game plays faster. Still remembering permanent abilities can be a challenge if you have a lot of them, but I love the multi-use cards and developing a strategy each round.

The expansions adds some new modules and cards. I definitely like all of the new cards and the market module. I feel the ships take some of the tightness away from the game.

I'm not normally a fan of euro games, but I liked this game.  I enjoyed the fact that it doesn't have a secret object (which I hate as it can punish beginners by not knowing what objectives exist). I also like that it has a high luck factor with the dice rolls and card draws.  Although, in the game I played I won largely by placing a great personality in a house early on. And while I though the number of different ways to accumulate victory points was good, I found it best to give up on a source of VPs (in my case building canals) if there is too much competition or you fall behind the pack.  What I didn't like was nearly all of the victory points are added up at the end so it it hard to know exactly who in the lead and by how much.  While I don't like to interfere with other players, I didn't see much this in the game and normally want more than I think this game has to screw with the other players.  Lastly, the theme for this game is incredibility boring and board itself is practically worthless in regards to the game mechanics.

I love this game's mechanics individually, but together they are a spectacular mess.  So you need yellow cards for the money bonus / finish your three point canal / reduce your threats?  Try not being able to draw any for the last half of the game.  Don't need a red card?  Too bad, you just drew four in a row.  Feld clearly forgets here that, while probabilities even out over a large number of plays, in small batches clusters can occur, and in this game clusters kill.  Feld's worst game by far.

Beautiful aesthetics, strategic play possible, agonizing decisions with the impending disaster mitigation and multi-use cards...it's all there except the gameplay just didn't do much for me. Still a very good game, just not for me.

RATING: 7
I actually enjoy luck in games as long as the game design makes no bones about it. Bruges gives you the feeling of having way more control than you actually have. I feel like I am playing a strategic game, but it's actually a very tactical one. I feel let down everytime I'm endlessly waiting for the right persons to show up or for the right colour to finally let me finish my canal segment. It's like I play a different game in my mind than on the board, a game where all my careful calculations prove to be succuessful in the end. I somehow can't get over this deception.
One other complaint I have about Bruges is that building canals is extremely unsexy. In my opinion it should have been something more majestic you can build there on the board, like city walls. THAT is something I would want to build.

Brügge is fast and very thematic, it often hits our table. The artwork is exceptional. The game plays well and is really easy to teach. It could be seen as a game with lot of things depending on luck, but I think the challenge of this game is to use your cards the best way possible from turn to turn. 

I'll give it 10 points.
Great work!

A standard light to mid-weight euro. Nothing special. Similar to many euros - build an engine, have limited interaction with the other players, and then determine the winner at the end. They put in no real effort to create a decent theme for this game.

In terms of the gameplay, the impact of the 'threats' as they occur are not as great as you may think, and I let them happen to me a couple of times, rather than burning turns to prevent them. The other players were more conservative and did everything they could to prevent them. My strategy paid off as I was able to score more points in those turns than I lost through the threats, and so won in the end.

RATING: 7
I really found Bruges dull without the expansion. With it, play was more dynamic and options opened up or closed down over time. We kept it around for awhile even though we knew we wouldn't keep it long term, thinking that it was worth some concentrated play before trading. In January of 2017 we got 10 plays in for a 10x10 challenge. They were interesting, and I felt like I could finally see the game, and try some new and interesting things. Always good to play a game out. Buh Bye Bruges.

First impression: At first glance, this is a very nicely produced luck-fest. You get working card combos. Or not. I'm not sure if it was really necessary to have onehundredandsixtyfive different cards in this game. Sure, some are very familiar to others so there are only so many different cards in it. Will try it again, but I'm not convinced now.

Second Impression: After some more games, I started to like it quite a bit. Solid designed engine builder.

RATING: 5
A simple, rythmical game by Stefan Feld, almost soothingly so; and one of his first titles which felt like a coherent whole in which no particular mechanism takes the central limelight.

Game-technically the game revolves around incomplete information card draw decisions for a subsequent turn, and then making the best with the small hand you've been dealt. Probably a good player is able to circumvent the luck of the draw a little and be able to use his hand no matter what turns up (not unlike Kingdom Builder) but at the same there's quite a bit of variety in the cards which suggests that the analogy can only be taken so far. Whatever the case: Brugge is friendly to play, but is not entirely simple either, which probably accounts for a good deal of its popularity. 

Does the game attempt to create novel interaction? Of course not. There is hardly any, when it comes to that. That is sad, but neither should I completely dismiss the effort put into this game: it's not easy to create a game of this complexity level. I can see myself joining in a few more times in the future.

A Feld with "take that!". I liked the experience. If I needed a Feld I would add this to the pool of a choice. Thankfully my group has all of them, so I have no need.

If I plan again, I wouldn't change much. I would find an end game scoring card sooner and either keep it as a final blow against my opponents.

The mechanics in this one come together very well around the central persons tableau.

We like to split that reserve stack and play it too until one of its stacks get to be empty. The players pace the game based on their preference. You could choose to make it a bit shorter by just choosing out of one stack.

One player may need just enough cards at the end to have an equal number of cards in their hand to their opponent. 

Love the game. Perfect. I do not like it as well when it ends early due to getting done too soon all hasty like. Players need to be given enough time to enjoy the experience.

Our gatekeeper really plays it for free with no card required.

No game feels like it is trying harder to please me. This game is the opposite of dry. It is downright wet and saucy. We run through the sprinkler on a warm summer day and we laugh like kids and then go in...and the magic was and is everywhere.

Very nicely crafted game.

I love this game, but it's not without problems. Bruges is a little too tactical, less strategic than I would like, but it's a joy to play and easy to teach. Every once in a while though, there are times when you really need a purple card in order to get purple workers to run your engine or build that crucial canal, and you just can't draw a purple card. That can be extremely frustrating. The game would be less frustrating, I think, if there was a way to transform any card into any color of your choice by discarding a card or sacrificing a worker or two of another color or paying a couple guilders. Either that or have stacks of cards in each of the colors off to the side whose fronts are blank, and you can draw one and only one of these blank cards in any color you choose per round. The game can also induce AP in me and my friends like almost no other game.

Bruges is a fun play.  Be prepared for some randomness, but the whole concept of the draw decks prepare you for that.  The available actions are simple, so there is not much wait between turns.
Choices are still good, and there are combos to he had if you build properly.  Multiple uses for each card always gave you enough choices to keep things going.
There are disasters that can happen, but but I am not sure how I feel about them.  They didn't strike hard in my first play, but the random part of the card draw could make them tougher to deal with.
I liked the scoring.  A little happened in the game, but most happened at the end.  Good tension, and keeps your focus on the task at hand...not worrying about who is 3 points ahead.
Good game.  I think the random nature adds to the replay value.  
Don't forget to avoid first edition until they fix the coins and card fix.

This game will definitely  take you 2-3 games to really start to get a grasp of it. There are a lot of card (no two cards are exactly the same) so maybe take a few minutes with your group to look at some of the cards before you start. Just know that while each card is unique, most cards do the same thing for a different color or a different factions, so there is definitely a clear pattern as to the types of cards you will end up seeing.

Once you start to get the hang of the game, if you are into other euros that are similar to this, you are going to love it.

My wife picked this up for me on a whim last Christmas. Turned out to be our favorite game of a large stack of gifts that included Seasons and Suburbia. It's hard to plan strategies too far in advance due to the random nature of the card draws.

I needed something for my Christmas list.  The Secret Cabal guys were talking this one up, so I threw it on my list and ended up getting it for Christmas.  I played it about 4 times, and it just wasn't for me.  I felt it was too random to try and come up with any viable strategy, and the tactical play I didn't find that appealing.  While the cards can be used for different things, this sounds better in theory than in the way the game plays out.  I ended up giving this away to one of my friends who really enjoyed it.  I don't really care for it, but i could see being talked into playing it.  It doesn't last too long.

[7 July 2017] - 6.75 (3 plays)
Interesting game of trying to draw card unseen to try to progress building different engine elements to generate points while avoiding collecting too many threats. The game is interesting in play but is SO random. Threats and values of cards is determined by dice rolls. Additionally, card draws come from one of two decks with only the color of the card known at the time. This means that some players can get cards that work well together and other times you can be left stalled out. I would play again but wouldn't seek out a game.

Brügge is one of the few Feld games that doesn't really work for me. Normally, I don't mind heavily tactical gameplay but here I don't really enjoy it. If I'm in the mood for such a game and want to play a Feld, I would probably put La Isla on the table. 
Maybe I just have to give a few more tries, but until then I'll give it a 5.

After revisiting Brügge a few years later and accepting it's tactical nature, I have to up my rating a little up. This time around, I just used the synergies I had in hand and didn't wait for some great combo that might or might not show up which led to a more enjoyable and fun game. Let's see what happens the next time I play it.

Feld's game design within the last few years has devolved to one concept:

"Choose some cards, tiles or bits. Then wait to see if other matching cards, tiles, and bits come into play. Such tension! Are they in play? Or still in the box?!? If they are in play, you win!" 

What the hell happened to the guy who designed Notre Dame?

Edit: gave it another try with the expansion. It's so much worse it was actually funny. Amazing what garbage Feld gets away with on the strength of his earlier work.

Edit: Played Notre Dame again. That one sucks too.

Lighter Stefan Feld game where players assist in the development of medieval Bruges.  Some dice are rolled which sets up some parameters for the turn.  Players then take turns playing a card from their hand and taking an action associated with the card.  Actions include drawing income, cash, workers, building canal segments and so on.  The card played may be recruited into that player's faction, granting some special power for the remainder of the game.  The player with the most victory points wins the game.

Bright, colourful game, that plays very smoothly, and is much lighter than Feld's more recent games.  The actions are quick to resolve, and the 150 or so character cards in the keep it quite fresh as you explore character ability combinations.  I enjoyed this one.

It's lighter and easy to learn, like Speicherstadt or Notre Dame and not too overwrought with piles of point-scoring mechanisms, like Trajan or Bora Bora.   There's damage mitigation in 5 categories, another Feld hallmark.   Cards serve many purposes, being discarded for workers, money, houses, canals, or threat reduction, but they also contain useful characters that can be slotted into houses, providing instant, one-shot, or repeatable paid abilities.   The actions provided by the character cards can be quite nasty and unexpected, and that gives the game some spice.  There's a hint of CCG here.  At $60 retail, this is most certainly over-priced, but otherwise a quick and fun game with a lot of variety in the cards.

Kipróbáltuk 3 fővel a játékot. Töredelmesen be kell valljam, hogy nekem nagyon tetszenek a kártya vezérelt euro-k, a kétségtelen szerencsefaktor ellenére vagy épp azért :). S meg kell mondjam, hogy eddig az összes Feld tetszik, amit kipróbáltam, mert ugyanúgy, mint ebben is, több út is vezethet győzelemre, a kártyákat kell ügyesen kombinálni, a kocka nemigazán visz be többlet szerencsét a játékba, közben folyamatosan úgy érzed, hogy "játszol", így vagy úgy, de 'VP'-t (Victory Point) szerzel folyamatosan, a másiknak keresztbe lehet tenni, de még sincs sértődés belőle, egyszóval 'FUN'. Minden forduló 4 fázisból áll, de a harmadikban gondolkodunk a legtöbbet, mire kiválasztjuk a 4 akciónkat, mivel minden kártyával 5 fix akciót végre lehet hajtani, ami mégis sokszor teljesen különböző értéket képvisel helyzettől függően, mivel a kártya színe döntően befolyásolja a használhatóságát. Ezen kívül a 6. lehetséges akció viszi el a játék magját, hiszen a toborzás útján szerezhető szakemberek és azok képességei fogják meghatározni főleg a stratégiánkat. Egy játék után azt mondanám, hogy a játék jól ki van egyensúlyozva a szerencse szerepének figyelembevételével is. Nekem nem sikerült olyan képességű emberkéhez jutni, aki plusz akciót kínál. Azt hittem, így döntően le fogok maradni a többiektől. Annak ellenére, hogy nekem kevesebb emberem volt és közöttük egy sem volt olyan, aki plusz akciót biztosított volna, mégis sikerült a 2. helyen végeznem egy teljesen más stratégiával, 2 ponttal lemaradva az elsőtől. Egyébként a 3. játékos is 2 ponttal volt tőlem lemaradva a végelszámolásnál, így elmondható, hogy ez egy szoros parti volt. A játékban nincs túl sok szabály és elég egyértelműek, így a játék nyugodtan ajánlható családoknak is, akit nem befolyásol a kártyák nyelvfüggősége. Mivel egy-egy kártyalapot helyzettől függően többféleképpen is fel lehet használni, úgy gondolom, hogy a játék újrajátszhatóságával sincs gond. A játékra egy óra játékidő van írva, ami valószínűleg tartható is, mi mégis el húztuk több, mint 2 órán át a játékszabály ismertetéssel együtt, de ez nem mérvadó, mert első játék volt, s mi szeretünk sokat gondolkodni, hogy "megfontolt" lépést tegyünk :). Mindent egybevéve én csak ajánlani tudom. (2015.07.26.)

Very much enjoy Bruges for what it is.  Good depth of play with a tighter point salad than most other Felds.

Essentially a card combo game that has a good dose of luck via card draw.

Fun: Setting up an engine and feeling a sense of accomplishment when cards chain together. Getting bonus chits. Short play time. Unfun: When luck of the draw gives an opponent an unbeatable engine early, or when it prevents you from removing a disaster tile that later tears apart your plans.

[b][FirstPlayOn10thSept2013][/b] I really like the board. It's small, yet functional in every area. No waste of space, I think.

The game includes 8 overview cards (2 for each player) and 1 setup card. It really helps teaching the game and speed up the process. I always print player aids from the files section of a game, but when I saw this game has them, I was happy. The overview cards explained everything about the game (end game, game phases, all 6 actions and effect of threats) very well.

I also like the interaction in this game, be it the majority tokens, card play and the dice.

I really really dig this game. It's light (to me), yet deep because of the card play. A friend of mine said this is Stefan Feld's take on [thing=19857][/thing], as a card in this game can be used for one of multiple things. Pretty cool.

[b][Update 22nd Sept 2013][/b]: Currently at my 10th play since I got the game 17 days ago (10 plays within 17 days)! That's less than 3 weeks, and less than a month!

I'm really digging this game. The first time I played it, the owner insisted we play it twice so that everyone was on equal footing for the second game. I enjoyed that second game so much, that I practically forced my wife to play with me a month later, and then we bought it. 

Great little game, many paths to victory, which is one thing we look for in a game. I don't think I'd refuse a play of this if it was available.

Bruges is the third Stefan Feld game of the year. It's not as extraordinary as Bora Bora, which is a truly brilliant thing where the aims and ideas interweave beautifully and with complexity. Nor is it as elegantly simple and streamlined as Rialto, which is an astonishingly good game (and I am loving the 9/10 review for that one in the German Spielbox magazine). 

Instead here we have a kind of Macao-lite (his game from 2009), where the game revolves around character cards and the interplay between the benefits of the cards you play. With 165 different cards there is much to explore here, although the luck of the card draw is fairly dominant. In Macao you feel in control whereas here your strategy and tactics are dictated by your card drawing. Also you can be prone to 'bad dice' here rather than in Macao where you select the dice and manage your tactics around them. I like it, but it isn't on the similar level as Macao nor his other two sumptuous designs from 2013: Rialto and Bora Bora. 

Update: it is growing on me more. I've upped to an 8.

A card management game played over rounds of four actions each. Players must decide which cards will be played for their abilities (one time or persistent) and which will be fodder for other actions, money and tableau building. There's a vying for leader in three categories that can swing a few points at the end of the game. Between 3 or 4 players struggling to take the lead for these bonus points is very difficult! The expansion rounds out the game wonderfully, after 5 plays I'm convinced the expansion is absolutely necessary. The best thing about this game is the same as In the Year of the Dragon - you have to hang on tight and manage as best you can a strategy out of what the game deals you.

60-90m, best with 3-4 players. 5+ plays

2014-08-15 : Purely tactical game - you make the best of the cards you get, looking for combos that work with what you already have. You can make points in a variety of ways and you got to watch what your opponents are doing as well - and try to time the disasters. Normally such a game would get an 8 from me, but a point is deducted because there's virtually no strategic element to this game. But it's fun building your engine, and it's fast, so a solid 7
2015-01-11 : After playing it another time, the score is lowered to 6 because there are just too many randomn elements in this game, from the dice to the card-drafting.

I had really high hopes for Bruges. The tight scoring and randomness of the dice and cards really bother me. I feel like the scoring is so tight that the winner seems likely to be determined by the randomness. For example, in one game I played, if one more purple 5/6 had been rolled, the 1st place player would have come in last place. I do like it's simplicity and length.  It's not a bad game by any means, and I would certainly play it with people who own it and wanted to, but it's not one for me to keep in my collection.  Maybe the expansion improves it.

[b]Rating based on - 3 plays, 2 player[/b]
A board game with multi-use cards that you can use to take workers or money, mitigate a threat, build a canal or a house, or hire the character depicted on the card all in order to build up the Renaissance era city of Bruges and score the most victory points. Sounded much more exciting than it was for us to actually play. I think maybe this is better as a multiplayer game. Many of the cards reference making 'every other player' do something and it's just not worth it in a 2 player game. Also played with the boats from the expansion which was super fun but not enough for this to be a keeper.

Simply amazing! I love games with multiple uses for cards and this is a great implementation!

Yes, there is a lot of randomness in the game and it can be frustrating at times. You might not get the colors you need, or the people to build a combo, or the dice can screw you in multiple ways. But in the end, playing this game feels is such a blast. You never know what you get and you try to make the best out of the situation at hand.

Light/medium Feld game, I love games that have cards with multiple uses.  Can be screwed by luck (if you don't draw a card of a colour you need), but I don't mind that in a 45-60 min game, and you must make the best of whatyou get.  

Feels somewhat CCG-like with persons having unique abilities.  Reminds me somewhat of Glory to Rome with multiple uses for each card, and Magic the Gathering with the way that persons are activated by workers (and tapping).  Fairly simple rule-set, lots of options and your game strategy changes radically depending on what persons you have in play.

Perhaps best with 3 or 4, but decent with 2.

Note important changes implemented in [thread=1066510]second printing[/thread] (which I have), especially to the [thread=1104560]engraver[/thread] which was originally [thread=958355]overpowered[/thread].

I think I finally understand the term "point salad" this game is ok but seems dependent on what cards you draw. The dice are not really all that interesting as an random event generator and it goes without saying that the theme is completely disposable.

This is a pleasant enough game.  It's certainly far more enjoyable for me than Trajan or Castles of Burgundy.  I'd willingly play it again if someone were to ask for it.  On the other hand, in the game we played, Dan won because he drew the personality that gives you 2 VP for each different type of person.  As a result, the game was an anticlimax.  But it's short.

So far it's the most interesting Stefan Feld game I have tried. I didn't care for Trajan, Notre Dame, and after having watched a demo of Castles of Burgundy it is not as appealing as it once was. There are still many elements to balance but this game seems a little less fiddly and more streamlined. I'm interesting in trying it out again.

Edit: I have since played Castles of Burgundy and liked it very much. I want to try Bruges a few more times before I decide on getting it.

I like that every character in the game has a unique ability and that each of the character roles focus on different aspects of the game and can create some nice synergies. I enjoy the use of the threat markers. They provide a strong sense of tension, act as a good balance for high rolls, and open up opportunities for players to attack each other. End game scoring appears to reward both focused and diverse strategies, which should give the game some strong replay value.

For this type of game, the management of the different mechanics is quite nice, but the moribund trajectory of the theme and card powers just don't do much for me. If this had been set in space, or dystopian future, I think it would have been an even stronger seller, and much more popular.[/b]

One of the lighter Feld games. Turns move quickly in this game and the actions are all pretty simple. You build your own little engine with the characters you put down.

However I do not like the take-that cards in this game. In some games I do not mind them, but here one card can destroy your meticulously built engine and destroy your chances of winning. It's too frustrating to put a lot of resources in your engine only to see it destroyed the same turn.

Bruges has turned out to be one of my favorite Feld games.  The basic rules are fairly simple, but there are so may options with 150 unique cards. Many of the familiar Feld elements are there: the many paths to victory, the constant threats that loom over the game, and an ingenious use for dice that are rolled once each turn.  There is significantly more luck in this game than his others with the card draw playing such an important part, but I still feel like I have a lot of control about which cards to use in what ways and there are so many good options that I don't ever feel that unlucky.  It feels a little like Race for the Galaxy meets In the Year of the Dragon.  I enjoyed this game a lot more than I thought I would.  It's only one of two games out of over 120 new games I've tried since January 2013 that I rate 9.5 or higher (the other being Tzolk'in).

Too slow for me and has too much random to be a true engine builder - you can attempt to create an efficient engine but even with a lot of powers you can end up with two turns and no cards to power them.

The problem, as I see it, is that it's a solitaire with just enough low grade interaction to prevent it from being played simultaneously. Removing some of the take-that interaction and replacing it with end of turn results might make it more simultaneous and faster.

Right now it doesn't clock in at 60 minutes w. 4 players but almost twice that, and that's way, way, way too long for what it delivers.

Great art though, and some fun (or painful) opportunities for screwage.

I was a little surprised to see HiG publish a Feld title. Having played the game now, I no longer am. Now I am just surprised that Brügge is a Feld title. I'll have to render that a little more precisely, though.

In some ways, Brügge is a very typical Feld: There are lots of little ways to score points, a boatload of "stuff that does things" (cards instead of tiles this time), and lots of tactical optimization challenges. In some other ways it's rather atypical: There is a pronounced luck factor determining which cards you get to draw and what catastrophes happen and some direct attack cards as well, although they always target the entire table and never just individual players. Due to the huge number of different cards in the game you can also never be sure that a synergy you are building for and investing in can actually be exploited. If such a plan does come together the benefits can be huge.

All in all the game is far too chaotic and tactical for my liking, or too long and too strongly concerned with minute details that don't matter much in the end.

BRÜGGE entpuppt sich klemmender, als es zunächst den Anschein hat. Der Mangel entsteht durch potenzielles Kartenunglück. Ausgeliefertsein an die Farbkarten, die der Kartenstapel für einen bereithält und das Bemühen, das Beste aus dem Gegebenen zu machen, ist das Schöne des Spiels. BRÜGGE hat hinter seinem marshmellowigem Kombi- und taktischem Optimierungscharakter einen Liebreiz, der an NOTRE DAME erinnert und in seiner Mischung aus schneller Spielbarkeit, Schicksalhaftem, Glück, Unglück und Planung diesem am nächsten kommt.

Very nice game. I love games where you can combine cardpowers and try to find good combos.
There are some negatives with this game:
- There is a high luck factor in the game:
-- the dice define how many disasters come into play and if you have easy acces to money or not.
-- sometimes you don't get the cards of the color you need.
-- building good combo depends on luck. If you play a card which becomes stronger for each other card of a certain type you have in play it can happen that you never see this type again in the game.

So it is much more a game of reaction than planning. If you play a character who helps you to get rid of disastertokens and the whole game you get no 3 of a kind this character was wasted compared to the cards the other players played. If you play this card and there come lot of disasters this card can give you the victory. But you can't know what will happen when you play the card.

I don't like the fact that building a canal and stepping up the reputation track give no ingame advantage. That is just boring compared to playing persons.

This game has one of my least favorite mechanisms: cards that are everything.  The cards in this game are money, houses and the people who live in the houses.  Because there are few turns and cards are valuable it's a real rub trying to decide what to use for what and I really don't enjoy this mechanic here.  That being said, this really is a good game, it's just not one of my favorites.

Light Feld game with multiuse cards. Enjoy the way the dice are used along with the cards. The threats are a cool element to this game. Canal action seems a bit boring but I heard it is much better with expac (which is OOP)

Best with 4 probably so that the Majority tokens are very contested every round

Take each hand of five cards as an individual puzzle which you solve by employing the various uses of the cards in the best possible way and the playing experience improves. However, if you insist upon bringing characters into play as a means for developing a longer term strategy then you are likely to end up dissatisfied and frustrated.

Even though it's a point salad game, the sheer variety of all those wonderful cards makes the game FUN. The theme is pasted on, but it matters not. The artwork on the cards & board magnifies the gaming experience. We had a blast playing this several times now. There are a number of strategies to score points, but it's not overwhelming.

I had high hopes for this one because Feld is my favorite designer.  However, it just fell flat with us. It didn't have a unique mechanism to set it apart, other than multi-use cards, which has been done (better, IMO) before. If I want a game with multi-use cards, I'll play Glory to Rome. I also didn't like the threats; they were just too stressful to deal with. Of course, we also had some REALLY bad rolls.

Revised judgement after 5+ plays. The game did not feel quite like my taste initially. Thought it was too random and repetitive.

Deeper and funnier than it appears at first sight. I recommend it.

I really like games where the cards have multiple uses and you try to make the best of the hand you are dealt. I get that La Granja vibe from it while this plays a little faster and feels way more light. Only thing I do not like is that it ends to quickly, but that makes it possible to play it multiple times in the one sitting, so probably okay.

What does it all mean? I'm building a wall that I can't possibly finish, putting people in houses because my neighbor is, and moving up a crosswalk in front of fancy buildings. I doesn't matter because designer Stephan Feld has created a brilliant balancing act here. Cards can be used in a multitude of ways so possibilities are always sacrificed. As simple as this game seems at first, it quickly becomes a brain burner. Right up there with The Speicherstadt as one of my new favorite Euros.

Very fun game, fits that light/mid weight euro game.  Can play it quickly with the wife and we're not drained afterwards.  I like how it keeps you focussed on what your opponent is doing even without any blocking because you want to make sure you're close in all the majorities so they don't beat you by getting a bunch of cheap points at the end.  Can't wait to play it again, plus it is gorgeous!  Hits the spot when you don't feel like running your brain through a grinder like Agricola or most other Feld titles.

Opinion: I used to like those games that use cards giving you the opportunity to do lot of things with them, so you have to choose carefully what to do with them and refuse some of the bonuses you have on them. But I had the feeling that there was too much randomness in this game.
You have cards all turns, and draw new ones to replace, choosing the color you have available from 2 different decks. So far, so good, but, at least for me, you have the wrong feeling that you can control what you are doing, while you are depending so much on the cards you draw and the colors available.
Found also a bit unbalance on the cards, if you have the opportunity to have a really good card from the beginning, everything from there is not as difficult as it should.
You could say that I could control things if I would play more, but do not have the feeling nor the necessity that I would do. Will play it if someone put it on the table, but will not suggest it

Bruges is a multi use card game in the vain of games like Race for the galaxy , 51 state , glory to rome ,& san Jan. I am not the Biggest fan of this style game but I am really enjoying this one , every turn comes with a hard decision every card is good and is needed in a billion different ways. The engine building aspect is a bit harder to find in bruges compared to other games in this style but I don't find that detracts much from it.

100+ games in my collection, and my wife calls this her favorite game of all time (as of Oct 2014).

Rented - This game is alright.  I liked it slightly better than my wife.  The theme feels pretty weak, what I think people mean when they say "pasted on".  The only mechanic that seemed to really work in the theme was the dice which drove the reputation track (sometimes cheap, sometimes expense, sometimes you can't even affect your reputation) as well as the various threats (will they hit, will they not, what's going to come crashing down on us:  rats, thieves, fire, floods, etc.).  Fun, but very solitary game play with little chance to affect each other.

Standard Feld, although not my favorite. I felt like I wanted to do more and perhaps found the mechanics a bit too light. I think if you made the game a touch longer and played with more than 2 it would be stronger. Not bad though; Feld games are a solid choice.

A good game, but there's too much luck involved for my liking. There isn't much interaction, too, while some cards can kill 2 whole turns...

After a break and another play, this goes down, as it's about luck mostly. Reminds me of Settlers, when you don't get the right cards (or dice rolls), you won't get the money you need.

Some good ideas, but I won't play this again which is what everyone in my group said.

While Bruges is mechanically sound, there is little tension between what other players are doing and you (short of the 4 point incentives, which are likely not to win you the game).

Tentative rating after one play. Like most of Feld's stuff, this could have benefitted from a little editing. For example the prestige track adds little, and the requirement to build houses slows you down without adding any interesting choices. More thoughts on this if I play it again... I'd be willing, at least.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
It's a good Feld game, but not his best. Everything is well-thought out and the game overall is fun to play. The problem, as pointed out by others, is that it ends too soon. Unless you get extremely lucky, since you can only keep one card for future rounds, it would usually take awhile to build up the combo engine you want, at which point the game will probably come to an end in a round or two. Will try playing with 6 cards and 4 actions per round and/or adding a few more cards into the draw pile to prolong the game by 2 or 3 rounds next time to see if it helps.

Bruges is a tightly knit action game based on people cards representing different classes in the medieval city of that name.

The cards are needed to provide money, worker resources, housing for other cards, to build canals and to alleviate threats and/or take actions. Choose the right ones, build at the right times, and you may be the winner of this game.

Of course there is also a variant use for dice in the game (it is a Feld design).  Between dice and card draw, a certain amount of luck is built in- but there are so many options that while choosing can be difficult, there is generally something useful to do so that frustration is minimized.

I found Bruges to be enjoyable, tightly linked to choices selected (as well as any luck-based elements), and over all a nicely thought-out game which is fun to play and rather variable.

Started at a 7.75 after (2) plays.

I really like the game's concept of using multi-functional cards.  You must decide whether to use a card for money, to get workers, to build a canal, buy the person on the card, turn it into a building or turn it in to discard a threat for 1 VP.  After my first 2 plays, I feel you must gear your strategy around the cards you are dealt early in the game, especially the 12-cost cards that score end game VPs.

4 plays and I can't quite decide if I like the game.  I enjoy chance in a game but this level of randomness is disconcerting in a euro.  If you don't get the card you need you can get completely boned.  And I don't mean not being able to execute that perfect strategy.  I mean having a plague come in and not being able to clear it because round after round you don't see a single purple card.  Not.a.single.one.  so you just watch helplessly as you die.

On the other hand it does force you to be relentlessly opportunistic and tactical.  And it plays fast.  So there's that.  Usually random games are a bit more ... fun...

A Feld for gamers who don't care for Feld.

A sturdy hand management game, that just hasn't resonated with me.

It truly deserves more plays before I form a full opinion.

Recently added the expansion and then promptly placed it in my trade pile.

Interesting game.
At the start of a round, you draw back up to 5 cards. You can kind of speculate what colors you want (you can see the card backs as you draw), but there really isn't that much choice--essentially you see 5 cards; you must draw 4; one card is from previous turn so there is your 5 cards. Then dice are rolled which determine various things such as how much money you get from cashing in those colors for money that round, etc.

What stinks though is if you NEED a particular color (ie: purple) for the next canal build action, you might just be SOL. Like, you might never actually see a purple card ever. [We had a player who didn't see it any for four rounds straight.] And there isn't anything you can do about that. Eh. So the luck factor in this Feld can be much more hurtful.

I won't claim that it's incredibly balanced because I'm not sure that it is, but I do really like how the cards work in this game--most of them are the same, but they also have special powers. Among the games that use cards in multiple ways, this is one of the better ones. (2 plays)

A low end Feld.  Too much chaos. You are given a hand of cards but can not really formulate a strategy as you can only play a few cards hoping something comes up and having to essentially pitch away the rest of the hand.  Cards are not the right mechanic for this.  Worse yet one single card offers versatile end game scoring.  Since the game is chaotic a card that score on all combinations is almost always a winner for the one who draws it.

Great card-driven game with a lot of tough choices since every card has multiple uses.  Canals and Reputation track are a bit dull.  Overall, between the dice rolls and card draws, Bruges has a bit too much randomness for my taste. You can get arbitrarily shut out of actions on a turn because you weren't able to draw the color card you needed.

First attempt at one of Feld's games. Seems very interesting, give you a lot of options, yet tight. Thinky yet with a hint of push-your-luck. My wife and I enjoys it very much despite playing the rules wrong twice, once with the worker placement being only once per round and the other being the setup of the statues. Feels like an interesting race to score points. 

By taking out at least one deck of 33 cards adds so much replayability to this game

Edit: have been playing the game wrong the 3rd time, always mistook the 3 guilder icon for the 1 guilder icon.

Replayed it yesterday and it is still such an exciting game that offers risk management and card combos.

Quite enjoyable.  Not really quite enough to strategize on, but it was fun to get new cards each round.  Like unwrapping five fun treats.  The dice were very well integrated as well.  Look for the subtle trick of making the high value dice a really tough decision since they are also needed to eliminate threats.

Again though, nothing really to differentiate from game to game that I saw (in the first game).

I think he could have done away with the board however.  Maybe just a canal card for each player to use.

Played in much the same way as the other Feld games I have played in the past, many ways to score points and many different actions available per turn.  I sometimes find this approach irritating as it's sometimes nice to be lead (at least gently) in a certain direction, but at least it allows several replays in order to find your favoured tactic.

I'm fairly indifferent about this one, although I did like the variety in the cards - there really are tons of different 'workers' to draw from the deck.  From what I could tell it's a solid game, a chip off the block of Feld gaming mechanics.

RATING: 7.5
Cards that have multiple use is fun but cards that can be used in 7-8 ways, even better. Need a few more plays to see how good it is. 

I think the game ends a bit too fast.  When I get an engine going, someone is trying to end the game.  I guess that is just their strategy to not allow me to get ahead with my engine.

[b]2 Player Review:[/b]

It took me awhile to get into the minutia of [i]"Bruges"[/i]. At first it seemed to be an incredibly random game of chance. But after I learned to dedicate myself to one strategy early on in each game, my appreciation for the depth of the game changed. It isn't only about mitigating disasters, it's all about managing your hand efficiently to take advantage of every end game scoring chance your random hand of cards gives you, even if they only appear once every two rounds. 

Don't ever be detoured by an imperfect hand, there is always something meaningful to be done until those end game scoring chances present themselves. A ton of the fun comes from building houses, preparing workers for special ability combos, and putting out 5 different impending dooms. And you`re doing all this while fighting tooth and nail to not give an inch of leeway to the competition. Desperately trying to prevent them from capitalizing on the 3 bonus tiles for being in the lead in 3 different point-scoring fields.

[b]Pros:[/b]

- A very tense game of damage control that plays out in only 45 minutes for 2.
- Lots to think about, not just because each card can be used for many actions, but because each character special abilities allow for a lot of long term strategies. 

[b]Cons:[/b]

- Can feel like a loosing cause sometimes because of all the negative events.
-There are a number of aggressive cards in the deck that could cause some friction.

The game is actually pretty fun to play, it's just very difficult to get any kind of strategy going due to the luck of the card draw.  I normally like Feld's "point salad" approach quite well, but in this one it just doesn't seem to mesh as well as in others (Castles of Burgundy I'm looking at you).

It was difficult to rate this one, because it does many things well, but just doesn't quite seem to hit all the right notes.

Attractive artwork and overall presentation. However, the game itself is not as thematic as first appears. Although this is lighter than other Stefan Feld games, there are still many options on a player's turn and a number of ways of scoring points. There is quite a bit of luck involved and the sheer number of cards, few of which you will see during a game, makes it difficult to establish a long-term strategy that involves anything beyond whether to focus on recruiting people or building canal sections. The game is improved with the expansion.

Nuevamente Feld nos trae un juego de gestión de recursos muy agradable de jugar. En este caso se trata de algo un poquito más suave. Tranquilamente te lo puedes ventilar en algo más de una hora, tiene pinta de que escale bien en cuanto al número de jugadores.

Al inicio del turno robas una serie de cartas que irás usando para realizar acciones, construir canales, contratar trabajadores, ganar dinero, construir casas o la colocarás en una casa para poderte beneficiar de algún poder que te de, o para activarla posteriormente .... 

Cada turno se comprueban unas mayorías que otorgarán puntos.

RATING: 5
If I'm going to play a dry point grabbing Euro game, then it better be one with low luck, that is not the case here. Several cards (2 or 3) are overpowered compared to the rest of the pack, and while there are several copies of them, WHEN and IF you get them is critical to whether or not you will win, and its random (as are the colours you will pick up when drafting which is important, as are the colours of the high numbered dice rolled and will they match your cards also important, nevermind the screw you cards, etc). 

If you get the card that lets you "Pick up a card and do the action" (cost one worker) right near the beginning of the game, every round as long as you have the right colour card to get two workers, you can spend one action to get the workers and then use them to get two actions netting 1 extra action every round. In a game where you are getting 4 actions a round, having 5 instead of 4 is a HUGE advantage especially from the start! In the game I played one player got this early and one got it late and to me it made all the difference. (I see many others complaining about the Engraver as well and is a known issue that Feld changed in newer version)

Now there are some positives here for sure: Quick pace, easy to learn, short game time, several options and multiple ways to score BUT here is another thing I didn't like, the lack of planning. Its almost purely tactical, you don't know what cards you will get, what dice will be rolled, maybe not that important for this but it bugged me anyway.  

I typically like card driven games a lot, and this game might have been a 7 for me (also had a touch of crisis management which I also usually really like) but I have docked it 2 points (should maybe be 3) for being another unoriginal dry generic point grabber and more importantly for having too much luck in such a game. YMMV, hopefully most games the luck evens out, but with so many other games around I'm not sticking around in this one to find out, possibly my least favourite Feld to date.

One play. Did not get the cards needed (I saw three purple cards all game!) Reminds me of Macao a lot, but easier to enjoy.

Some cards seem too powerful compared to others of same cost.

Not a "never play again", but edging that way. Certainly not a purchase for me at RRP £50! Even at £30 I would feel I was being robbed a little.

Board needed to be a bit bigger (larger scoring track and perhaps storage for cards (especially discards)); a few more workers of each colour would have been a good idea (in our play); the card holders were a joke - tricky (almost impossible) not to reveal the colour of the next two cards when taking a card even when being careful.

But I'll play again. No purchase  (so like Bora Bora in that respect).

RATING: 7.9
Bruges is an enjoyable, well-illustrated card-based game that requires a blend of tactical decision making, long-term strategy and player interaction.  While the majority of a player's actions are based on effectively using the cards dealt, the game rewards players who play with a long-term strategy in mind.  As an example, a player has to balance the tactical decisions of which cards to discard for guilders/workers/houses with their long-term Victory Point generation strategy, such as canal building or person recruitment.  

While there is luck in the game, the mechanics grant the player reasonable latitude to mitigate the luck factor.  For instance, players can be penalized from the random results of the dice roll each round (i.e., "threat markers"), but the game provides players with the means to mitigate the impact of the threats through short-term tactics (such as discarding a card to remove a threat or eliminating the impact of the threat by using the threatened resource) or long-term planning (recruiting a person that addresses a threat).  

Finally, the game encourages a healthy amount of player interaction (i.e., managing "majorities" and recruiting persons that can force your opponent to change focus).  Unlike some eurogames, here I feel that I am truly playing against my opponent and not against the game itself.  

My wife and I will be enjoying this relatively quick game for a long time.

RATING: 6
This is a very random game. It can be fun trying to find combos between the powers, and the multi-use cards do allow for a lot of possibilities for your turn. But a lot of the time you just need a card of a certain color, and it's possible you'll never see a card of that color. It's one thing if this is your canal that you can't complete, you could argue that the game is then just pushing you in a different direction and it's your job to react. But if you set up a powerful action combo and you never see any cards that let you get the appropriate colored workers again that can hurt. And the dice are also problematic in that you might just never happen to have cards that can get you a lot of money, or get rid of the pie pieces. But at the end of the day it's a fairly breezy game, so it can be fun to go along for the ride as long as you know there's a lot of luck.

Bruges is possibly Stefan Feld's most accessible game. It provides a limited array of initial decisions, but gradually expands to provide a solid amount of depth. Unfortunately, the luck of the draw plays a significant part in the player's ability to put together powerful combos. There are plenty of fun mechanics to enjoy here, but unlike the best Feld games, the high degree of variability (and lack of control over it) lessens that enjoyment and increases the frustration in putting together a series of winning decisions.

It's one of those "I want to do everything" games.  The cards do six different things, some of which cost resources (money or workers).  Each player starts with 5 cards and plays them one at a time until everyone has played 4 cards; then everyone replenishes.  Some of the cards stay in play and give you abilities that are one-time, continuing, or pay-to-use.  There's AP potential, but once you figure out your strategy for a turn, it's usually bang-bang-bang.  This is not usually the type of game that I want to play a lot, but I'd certainly play it again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Don't know why it seems so many of my gaming bugs are putting this game down... maybe because Feld as of late has been known as the designer of gamer's games (on the heavier side)?  And this one is clearly a medium weight?

This is essentially a card game, the game board almost isn't needed (maybe only need one 1/4 the size, each player has a canal track, and a single race track).

My biggest complaint is that while you have 5 cards per round and only play 4 of them so you have some choice... is that the 5th card is carried over.  However with each card having 6 different uses it's kind of minor I guess.

Not very punishing even with the threat markers. Love this one!

Initial Rating: 6.5 (October 2013)

Another cool and different use of dice, another game in which you can do points in many ways, another typical Feld game, which is not a bad thing. I like Bruges, I feel there is a healthy dose of luck involved (mostly with the color and the unbalanced powers of the cards but also with the dice), but you can mitigate it with clever play. I feel this is a combination of Glory to Rome with a boardgame and the result is an elegant, light-medium, Euro game. You can use the cards in 6 different ways and that provides a lot of interesting decisions (highly tactical), however I felt the game lighter than I usually prefer (thus the rating). There is fun tension (another Feld hallmark) via the die catastrophes. 

The game components and art are ok (nothing special), the theme is paper-thin (as usual from Feld), the game can be explained quickly and it moves fluidly so I didn´t felt any downtime (a huge plus for me), still I prefer to play it with 3 but I won’t say no to a 4 player game :D. The game can be very confrontational, with many characters having a nasty/special power that will weaken your position.
 
I prefer Bora Bora over this one but I have yet to play Amerigo and Rialto. For now, I won’t say no to a game of Bruges and perhaps I will buy the game in the near future. I´m rating it a 6.5 because the game is lighter than I expected and it also have lots of luck with the cards.

I like the game but I don’t love it (yet), in my last game, the player who won played a very nasty card  than stole all our money and he played it in the very first turn. This is the kind of luck I dislike in an strategy game that plays over 2 hour or more. Still I enjoy Bruges but all other Feld games of 2013 are superior to this one IMO.

I will play again soon to see if my regard for the game improves and I think it will because I often think about this game. Perhaps I will buy it.

The randomness of the dice and cards keep this from becoming a snoozefest.  You never seem to have the right combination of cards and money at any time in the game and you usually want to do more on a turn than you have cards available, making the 'sixth card' ability very powerful.

Still, the game seems a little rushed and the fact the you can place any person into any house is inconsistent with the rest of the colour rules.

I really want to like this game more, and my rating might go up with more plays, but for now it only rates a 6.

Rulebook as printed, the game is a 6...maybe a 7. The original card draw is unfun luck.

Because of the nature of the cards, can be swingy at times.

This was quite an easy game to pick up and learn. Each turn you get to draft up to five cards and each card can do one of six actions. The game comes to life when suddenly you realize that the card you need to stop the pending disaster is the same card you need to make money this turn... And you need it to build your next canal, but you really want to place it in a house and use the action of the person. Auggghhhhhhhhh! !!!! And you can only do one thing with the card. 
Press your luck and you could get ahead... don't and you may never catch up.

This is a fun take on the multipurpose cards mechanism found in games like Race for the Galaxy, San Juan, and Gears of War.

This one feels very random even for Feld.  It's very difficult to get the right colors, let alone the right people, to do what you really want, so the whole game is basically about managing to do the best with the limited options that come your way every turn. Nonetheless it's pretty enjoyable for a quick game.

I simultaneously enjoy and get frustrated by the card draws in this game. There are times you really need a color of card but it just doesn't come to you and the same goes for end game scoring cards. I'd like to play it again to see how it develops but right now I'm not sure that it is something I'd want to own. 

I'm done with this one. It gives the feeling of a game which you want to plan for and in some sense to do. Unfortunately if you don't get some help from the deck you are out of luck. I have played La Isla which feels like a trimmed down version of this and it feels better. You get three cards and use them the best you can each round. a nicer pace for this kind of game.

This is mainly a card driven game in which cards can be used for six different actions such as gaining money, placing the card as a building, or playing characters onto the cards. The characters offer a variety of actions. The buildings and characters are also worth victory points. Building canals and paying money to advance each round also earn VPs. There is some dice rolling, but the random effects seem manageable. I enjoyed the variety of cards and trying to figure out the best ones to play as characters.

Need to play this one again, as it seems like I've missed something... But on my first play, this game didn't connect with me at all. I went through the motions, which were wildly disconnected from the "theme" of what I was trying to accomplish, and then just ended; it felt like one of the weaker Feld designs I'd played. Regardless will have to get this to the table again to give it another chance and see if I grok it better on the next play.

Many gamers seem to expect something different from Mr. Feld more in line with his Alea big box releases. Brügge delivers a distinctly tactical experience with some chaos thrown in for good measure that's dividing opinions among gamers. I enjoy it as a lightweight/medium game. Just accept that you can't always get the card colours you want and don't plan for them. This is not what Brügge is about anyway. Make the best out of what you're dealt and decide how much risk you want to take.
A few kinks keep it from being a great game. The bonus tiles are kind of odd. Mostly it's collecting them early or never at all. Some might never be claimed even with high invest when players progress jointly, others might be taken with a single action. The 4 points each of them provide are too important for this to not be bothering. If you're unlucky in card draws or die rolls your chances to win can be diminished easily without a major fault. Considering the game length of about an hour and the fun factor involved I can live with it. I also don't mind the take-that some of the cards introduce as all other players similarly are targeted.
While Brügge will not satisfy heavy eurogamers and strategists, it's an original game that might be worth owning. It could be still more appealing if the drab artwork was less of a deterrent.

Some of Feld's recent designs have been a little overwhelming for me to ingest, with too many things going on and too many different ways to score points.

Bruges seems simpler and quicker - if played in under 60 minutes, I'm all for it. If people drag their feet then the fun would be sucked out of the experience.

Even though there are a ton of different cards, they are all fairly similar, so I like the relative ease of play. It definitely is frustrating to not be able to draw the right color of card, but that's part of the fun.

I just wish there could be a theme that is somewhat interesting - except for It Happens, his games' themes are the worst.

Bruges turned out to be a major disappointment for me. There's a lot of nice stuff going on there, but it doesn't turn this into a good game. I like the variety and the supposed replayability provided by the cards and I especially like the multifunctionality of the cards. I also like the dice mechanism. What I don't like is that the game lacks flow. You aren't really getting anywhere, but instead keep on dabbling what little stuff you have and keep on wondering if this gets any better on the next round. Round after round. The balance of the cards is also a bit questionable and the luck of the draw - not just regarding the power of the cards, but also the color of the cards - is major turnoff and can swing the game towards somebody's favor. Besides these the graphical layout is really bland and the deckholders are of bad quality. However, it plays relatively quickly and I could play again.

I used to love the multi-use cards, and the multiple paths to victory, and the various small systems the game gave you. However, this game's fallen recently because of one thing: every game is the same. The game's pool of character powers is quite small, and in the end, each play seems to center around the same combos, which means there really aren't that many paths to victory, especially if you take out the really unexciting ones.

A Feld game themed around a local city.
The main highlight of this game are the multiuse cards. Every card can be used in 6 different ways, which is pretty neat.
It's a bit random for me though. They try to alleviate it by offering two different draw piles but it doesn't really work.

I like Bruges. There are a lot of ways to succeed, a lot of choices each round because the cards in your hands serve multiple purposes. The flow of the game is to be praised: everyone takes 4 actions per round, but they take them one at a time per player, so you don't spend a long time waiting for your turn. It has randomness in the die rolls, but the same dice affect everyone, so you can't get a personally terrible roll. You [i]can[/i] get bad card draws, but even the card drawing has some self-determination to it since there are two face-up piles to draw from. Very good game. Similar to [thing=8217][/thing] in the multi-purpose cards and multiple paths to victory.

I loved this game.

It felt like a more balanced Grand Austria Hotel.

Learning what actions require a matching color to be discarded is confusing because:
- some actions don't require a person to be discarded
- some abilities mimic actions that require a person to be discard, but don't require the discard

The expansion looks like a "must include" because it balances the river building to be more powerful ... but what do I know (one play only).

Just played for the first time this past weekend, and really enjoyed it! As a Feld game, I really enjoyed the dynamics involved; the dice reminded me of Macao, while the cards were a nice new addition. There is a bit of random luck involved in the game, because of the dice and the cards, but not so much that you can blame luck for lack of strategy. The dice affect everyone equally, and with the cards, it's about playing them to the best possible effect - kind of like in Agricola.  I played with 4 players and we all enjoyed it. I won by 1 point!

We did all notice a few things, regarding point scoring. Building the canals seems almost not worth the time, as the point yield is very minimal compared to the cards. As a fix for this, I think we might alter the rules slightly so that if a player builds both canals to the "3 point" marker or beyond, then the point value doubles. 12 points at game end would give more of an edge than just 6 (3 points per canal). This might entice players to focus on the canals more.

Other than that, the game play is balanced and fairly quick moving. There's not a lot of player interaction, other than fighting for majority, but players can directly impact each other by playing cards that hurt other players.

I'm not a big fan of card-based games, like Dominion and Race for the Galaxy, but this one provides a nice mix of cards, a board, and meeples that provide a more "board game" feel, despite being card-driven.

Another Feld success!

A utilitarian and minimilastic Feld euro game, with a healthy helping of randomness. There are enough decisions that you can make during this relatively quick game that make the randomness tolerable (at least for me). Bruges gives a full euro game experience in around an hour. I applaud two of my favorite designers (Uwe and Stefan) for succeeding in streamlining game systems, in hopes of creating fulfilling games in a third to half the time it would take to play some of their other games. You will absolutely not enjoy this if you can't tolerate randomness.

Aside from one massively overpowered card, this game is quick, and enjoyable.  One problem is that getting more characters is clearly the way to go, there is no need to offer a "majority" for that.  Canals are possibly underpowered.

But... game is short, so balance is not as critical.

On the positive side Bruges offers that classic agonizing "I want to do dozen different things but have only time to do one" feel throughout it's fairly short playing time.

It looks great. I like the variety of the person cards, However, once you go past the  surface, it does seem a bit disconnected.

It's a very typical Feld with very typical mechanism elements (for example, the unavoidable secondary scoring track). Menzel's artwork adds more theme than there actually is to the theme, but still...
I think I need to replay it to know how much this uncontrollable luck level bothers me. You want to get money as that's important for lots of features (especially the ones where you are even racing for majorities) but you just can't know which dice give you enough money (so you just keep hoping those dice will end up showing big numbers). Also, sometimes the card colors you really need just don't show up. Also the character abilities are not balanced (some of them are a bit too strong compared to others).
All these might not bother me as much as it seems but for such a thinky game I believe they do bother me somewhat - I need the repeated play to know how much.

A Feld with sometimes questionable game balance which makes it a bit light.  It's a pleasant and but atypically random play from that designer.  Some games you simply won't get the right cards and/or the right colors at draw and there's nothing you can really do about it.  The components are nice and each card is unique but I'm not convinced it justifies the high price.  Ultimately, it's an OK but rather bland game which is quite straight forward and must be taken lightly.  (Rating adjusted down after a few plays: just too random with no mitigation.  Expansion might help?)

RATING: 7
This is a solid Feld design that is very tactical in nature where you do the best with what you have in your immediate hand.  With all the 130+ cards being unique, one never exactly knows what one will draw/do.   The game plays in just around an hour if everyone knows how to play and is enjoyable for that time frame even with the luck of the draw.  The aspect of gold for hiring people cards and then acquiring workers to take special actions on some of the people cards works well to the point where there is basically two currencies in the game.  

There is potential for nastiness/take that in this game with one set of people cards which can be very effective if played at the right time.  The variance of the people cards in worker based effects, instant one time effects, end game scoring effects, etc. adds quite a bit of spice to the game as well.  There can be some agony/frustration with the card draw if you can't draw a certain color ever...there has been a couple games where I couldn't draw a brown card to save my life (I had two all game long).

Awesome game! I love Feld's, and this is so packed with options! It has more interaction between players than more of his titles, just because you have to compete for the "in the lead points". I agree that the last turn is mostly a mathematical problem, and in the end is all about optimizing your actions. But that is something that depends heavily on your previous choices, your opponents actions and a bit of luck.

Also, I didn't find this game that hard or complex as I thought it would be.

Over my initial play I really came to appreciate this system. The early going can be akin to stabbing in the dark, and indeed even some turns almost require a bit of blind faith that your preparations will be useful, there's the other side of things where the lack of player interaction actually serves to reduce the chances of screwage.

I do think experience will prove that you can predictively play and make wise decisions, and certainly the play time is so short that even the random elements do not hurt so bad.

In the end you have a game that's unique, fun, and fast. I'm looking forward to many more plays.

I'm always intrigued by games where the card decks do not have uniform backs.  That's a fun part of Bruges, since it affects which decks you want to draw from, kinda pushing your luck to a degree.  The residents seem pretty unique and minimally thematic, although the synergy between them don't seem consistent, especially since you can only have one held card from turn to turn.  Typical Feld salad at the end, and the board seems largely like a waste of space, but not bad game.

Just played a game where luck was not on my side the whole game and I got blasted because of it. It felt like there was nothing I could do to get out of it either. 
Hopefully that was a rare game. We will see.

That was a one time bad game so far. It has been playing great every other time.

Different color cards which can have multiple uses.  You can flip the card over to build a house.  Use them to gather workers, get money or build  canal. You play the card to mitigate some negative effect.  But lastly you put a character in a house which provides a permanent ability.  

I really like this game.  It is brilliant and it is a kind of simplified Glory to Rome.  Other than Trajan, this is my favorite Feld.

A solid, fast-playing design from Stefan Feld, and possibly the only game I own that has dice, cards, AND meeples!

The game is packed full of difficult decisions, with each card offering multiple choices, only one of which can be taken. This makes for a delightfully agonizing game. The game plays reasonably quickly, and is a good medium weight game typical of what I've come to expect from Hans im Gluck.

Artwork and components are fantastic. There's 165 unique cards, each with unique artwork (so lots of replayability as well as great art).

Multiplayer-Solitaire. Exakt null Interaktion. Nur für Menschen, die sich nichts zu sagen haben und auch niemandem gerne in die Augen schauen. Stefan Feld ist der Totengräber der Eurogames und vor allem der Verlage Hans im Glück und Alea (Was ist aus denen geworden? Man vergleiche die frühen Jahre mit Chinatown, Händler von Genua, Fürsten von Florenz, El Grande, Sankt Petersburg und jetzt nur noch Multiplayer Solitaire). Brügge ist eine furchtbare Zeitverschwendung, dabei ist es völlig nebensächlich, ob das Spiel zu glückabhängig ist oder nicht. Ich verabrede mich nicht mit Freunden, damit jeder sein eigenes Kreuzworträtsel löst.

Light card driven Feld game. The material (board and cards) really gets you into the atmosphere of Brugge. Still it stays pretty abstract. 

Once you know the game, it plays very fast. The cards are not always very clear in their descriptions.
The artwork of the game makes this a fun game to play.

Luck is important in this game. Which cards you draw at what time can influence the game enormously, especially when the game is short (f.e. 2 player game)

Main activity should be building houses and playing persons. 
The dice, can screw up your plans, but they are applicable to all players.
It is a fact that some cards seem a bit over powered, so getting and playing a strong card in the beginning of the game, can make a huge difference.

The gameplay is lacking a theme. You don't really know what you are doing, except trying to score points in different unrelated ways. There is no real theme related goal. No narrative. That is a pity and not uncommon for Feld games. 

Luckily the colorful board, the nice drawings of real Brugge buildings, the many different cards make this game attractive to play. 

Make the best of what you get. If you can live with that, you should try Bruges.

Minus: 2 (i miss the link between the gameplay and the theme) - 9 (too abstract for beginner)

Fun game.  I enjoy these types of games where there are multiple paths to victory, and you get variable powers.  It's fun to get an ability that nobody else has, and there are TONS of cards in this game with all sorts of different such abilities.

I'm really impressed that there are 165 different character cards, EACH with their own unique art work.  Compare that to Macao, which also has several different characters, but each one is illustrated with the same bearded man.  Even "Mrs. Red", "Lady Black", and "Baronessa Um" are all illustrated with this bearded man :) - so yes, Bruges much better in that regard!  

Colorful game too.  I really enjoy the 5 different colors, with their different options, corresponding dice, workers, threats, etc..

Only thing that seems a bit jarring and out of place is the "meanie" cards.  They can really hurt people quite a bit depending on their timing.  Feels like building a card house and someone bumping the table.  Seems a bit out of place.  I think they made the red cards potentially too harmful.

RATING: 7.5
As usual with Stefan Feld this game is tighter than a camel's a*** in a sandstorm. Everything is related to everything else, dependant on everything else and can completely bugger up your plans like everything else. Throw on top of this tight system the luck of the draw from the card deck and you have what many have called an unfair card driven luck-fest.

I disagree. I really like this game. It's not my favorite Feld game, have a look at my comments on Bora Bora for those. In Bruges I love the way it uses dice to set the economic / disaster regime of each round. I love the way you can use each card for 6 different things and that the role of the dice will set the value of many of these uses. I love that it has a little bit of interaction between players and most of all I love that it is fairy quick. If it was a very long game I would agree with most of the points detractors make about this game. But at the length it is, it is fun, thinky and competitive.

I haven't tried the expansion, I don't play the base game enough. Something I would like to change. Definitely a keeper until my kids get older and I can hopefully get them to enjoy it. I have a feeling I just have to talk up the fire, floods, plague of rats etc that you can send someone else's way and they will love it!

Love so many aspects of this game, love the card play and variable card powers.  Seem like there are so many different avenues to score and win.

(10/17) Drop to 7.  Ugh...just a heartbreaking drop in rating.  Just haven't been able to play it again since trading it after getting an offer I couldn't refuse.  Another copy is on its way with the fantastic Zwin expansion.  This should definitely rise back up.

An exercise in teaching boardgamers that sometimes you can't control every aspect of what you're playing. Sometimes you need to prepare and react to what the game does. People who don't like Bruges don't like the fact that they can't control enough aspects of the game. People who like it realize that the game is about taking what the game gives you, and making the best out of it. Bruges isn't perfect, but it's great for what it tries to do.

Feld released 4 games in 2013, and I bought two of them, Bruges and Amerigo. In my opinion, Bruges is the better of the two. It's one of those card games like London or San Juan, where there's multiple uses for each card. In Bruges, each card can be used in 1 of 6 different ways. There's a board, but it's really just a place holder. It's not integral to game play. Of the Feld games that I own:

1. Macao
2. Castles of Burgundy
3. Bruges
4. Amerigo

Wow i enjoyed this one more than i thought i would. Fires Castles of Burgundy for me. I really liked the threat dice and the element of pressure and tension it brings. Same thing with the bonus scoring tiles, you have to try and stay ahead of your opponents in difference categories. It's not just a point salad free for all here. More competition here and less of a multiplayer solitaire. And the cards each have various uses and things you can do with them. What a winner. Winner winner chicken dinner!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I am a sucker for Multiple-Uses-For-Cards games, but after playing this game a few times I have no desire to actually own it myself.

I really like that each card has a special character which you can build up to in order to progress your town.  That mechanic works very nicely.  However, what I don't like is that the dice can feel a bit tacked on to the game.  Their roll can determine whether the roles in your hand are worthwhile or not, which is extremely frustrating.  A good hand is one with many different cards, but you also want to look for synergistic sets.  It's just.. weird.

I would probably like, and think about owning, this game if I didn't already own Race for the Galaxy and had played Innovation and Glory to Rome.  I would recommend all three of those games over this one.

[b]2015-09-22 7.5[/b] After 1x 4p:
Salady: Yes. There is really no reason to build canal or move up reputation track other than the direct conversion to points. Though I do like the use of coloured card backs for a choice of standard actions and the front for recruits. Recruits that actually increase efficiency of future actions other than just points! The randomness of dice is also interesting, bringing both plagues and income and scoring opportunity.

Took 4 plays to "click" with us. The randomness of the cards is hard to mitigate and build something of an engine around. Rose to 7.8, might even rise a little more, but will never come near CoB or Trajan. The individual art on each card is an amazing feat though.

Feld does Glory to Rome.  There is a lot to love about this little game, but it could be better with a little less randomness on the card draw.  I really enjoy it as a 2p game, and I assume that is probably the best player count.  Especially with the majority tiles, it can make for some interesting battles/decisions.  Throughout the game, there are constant decisions where you can't do everything you want with the cards.  There are a lot of strategies to pursue, but it's tricky to settle on one from the get because you don't know how the cards are going to fall.  I almost wish there were different sets of pre-selected decks that you could mix in so that players had a little better idea of what cards/strategies are available. 

Still a fun game.

Bruges is a game of "here's what you get, now make the best of it." You draft cards each round only knowing their color. From there, you try to maximize your return by choosing one of six possible actions for 4/5 of your cards (the final card is carried over to the next round, typically). The game can be frustrating if you can't catch a color you really need, or if your characters don't work well together. The best player will not always win, but will win more often than others. Bruges is much like poker in that respect.

**********

If you buy the expansion, I recommend using just the boats.  They allow for a wider range of decisions and a little more forward planning without changing the overall feel of the game.

02/01/14 Played a three-player game in 79 minutes. 
The sheer amount of luck/chaos trumped everything else about the game. Once again Stefan Feld strikes out with me. At least this one didn't have some of the hallmarks of other Feld games like the 300 colored cubes in Macao that are never defined. Bruges didn't take an overly long time to play. But that is cold comfort.  I might be coerced into playing it again, but I'd rather not.

Update: hmm, I still enjoy the exercise of playing this, but it has its downsides: rather solitary play and the cards (and the dices) just have to fall right for you. It is deceiving: it looks like a strategic game at first, but really there is not that much control. Big differences in card strengths. It still enjoy playing it, with plenty of interesting decision to make in your turn.

Lots of handmanagement, various ways to score, not too heavy, but some good decisions to be made. Plenty of variation, because of all the different cards. A game up my alley.

RATING: 6
Downgraded from a 9 after a 4 player game. My original comments still stand for a 2 player game, as does my original rating, until I can play again with 2 and see if the same issues hold. In the 4 player game, it seemed that the luck of what cards and which people you drew had a drastic impact on how well you did. Some abilities seem much more powerful than others. The abilities that relied on collecting people from certain professions were next to useless in a four player game, perhaps because those professions were split between four people rather than two? The winner was clear a few rounds before the last round was triggered. Definitely not as enjoyable an experience, and it seemed much more dependent on luck than on how you chose to play your cards. More plays necessary to figure out if this is an issue with four players or with the game as a whole. - rating of 6 based on this experience.

Bought at GenCon 2014

Previous comments:
Something about this game really clicks with me. It is easy to learn, has streamlined play and still makes for interesting strategies (which can't be said for all Feld games, especially the first two). It also plays really well with 2 players, and I love it for that.

I love how the colours of the dice, cards, workers and people interact. Do you use that blue card to get 6 coins while the blue dice is a 6 this round, do you use it to get rid of a threat token, or do you use it to activate your abilities? Weighing up the choices based on the restrictions the cards place on you is very interesting.

One of the best euro-games in my book. The ability of using cards for multiple things are always fun, although only one of the things is unique, the rest are just based on suit-values. In my mind La Granja is the best game for this type of card-play.

Bruges still offers one of the most satisfying experiences due to the character powers and the ever-present misfortunes that you need to be aware of.

This is light for a Feld but it's a great game. The multiple uses for cards and the variety of person abilities gives it a Glory to Rome or Race for the Galaxy feel but certainly less thinky. The trademark Feld disasters are present and ever-looming, but can be mitigated and often not harmful (and occasionally even beneficial!). It's shorter and lighter, easier to teach and easier to get to the table. Frustrations can occur when you can't draw the color you need but dealing with what you're dealt is all part of the fun.

After many plays, downrating from 8 to 6. It's a fine game but it just doesn't bring that much excitement anymore. Probably a bit too random to really capture me.

A classic Feld game for me that offers many ways to get points.  This game will see lots of play do the amount of strategy we get out of the shorter play time.  My current group loves these style of games with limited player interaction.

* Light-ish Feld card game
* Mostly tactical, as your game will largely depend on card draws
* Excellent use of cards as various resources (cash, workers, etc.)
* Multiple avenues to victory but you must be flexible (again, because of the card draws)
* Good for fellow Feldians and those who prefer tactics to strategy

This game feels a little more random than other feld games, because of the card draw and the dice. I do always take a lot of risks with the disasters so that makes the game more random I guess. The randomness doesn't bother me with this game since it plays in an hour or less. It is a 'go with the flow' sort of game that still offers interesting choices. The components are great, it is a good looking game (especially for a feld..). All in all i really like the game and the replayability is high because of the great ammount of cards. Two tumbs up for me.

The second half of the game is where it starts to shine but the pace at the end of the game is really how the game should begin. Because it's a slow starter that ends before it begins I give it a 6.5. The mechanics are a solid design however.

Kellően összetett, "kényelmesen" agyégetős játék, sokféle akcióval, némi AP-veszéllyel (de még kezelhetően).

Szabályokat gyorsan fel lehet fogni, nincs játék közbeni szabálykönyv lapozgatás.

A legszebb benne, hogy még a laphúzástól és a kockadobástól sem érezni, hogy túl nagy lenne a szerencsefaktor, mert a sokrétű akciókkal mindezt kompenzálni lehet.

Hosszra sem vészes, játékosonként úgy fél órával lehet számolni.

Good first play. Highly tactical, some luck and loads of different character cards. Plays in under an hour. We'll see if it's a keeper.

It's a keeper. It packs a lot of decisions into a quick time. Better with 3 than with 2.

I like this more than my wife does, unfortunately.

The light switched on for her after a few plays, and she now really digs it.

Light-hearted and colorful with plenty of tactical decisions. There is ample randomness in the game, but skillful players will win most of the time. Derivative of other multi-use card decks, but so what? Feld places his unique spin on it. Everything balances well and you are thoroughly engaged throughout. Most importantly it's great fun to play.

Pulled this out again and have been playing nightly for about a month. Adding the star cards and the canal bonuses from the expansion breathe new life into this fine game.

Second hand 

Rules are very straight forward. It's a typical Feld game but one of the easier ones (together with La Isla). I think it's just perfect: a lot of different ways to gain points, plays in less than 2 hours (including reading the rules) with 4 players. There is some player interaction but also a lot of solitaire play: digging canals, building houses, attracting people to your city etc. I really liked it and I would love to play it again. Feld makes clever use of the dice again in this design.

Bruges is a fun, exciting, maddening roller-coaster of a euro.  You have to come up with  short-term plans (what to do with these 4 cards this round) and immediate tactics (what to do this turn).  The choices aren't too difficult, but when you find yourself able to capitalize on card combos or other things that happen in the game, it is very satisfying.

This is a terrible, awful, no good, very bad game. Highly random and chaotic, the cards play you more than you play the cards.  The scoring is disjointed and player decisions matter far less than the color of card you just drew.  

As a fan of Feld, I can say that this one is a stinker.

Brügge, die Stadt in Flandern (Belgien) die aussieht, "wie aus einem beschissenen Märchen". Wer das Zitat erkannt hat, der kennt auch den großartigen Film "Brügge sehen und sterben". Ein ungewöhnlicher Film voll mit schwarzem Humor und Tarantino-würdigen Dialogen. Doch was hat das alles mit dem Spiel zu tun? Nun, der Film war für mich quasi Auslöser für die Faszination der Stadt Brügge. Zweimal war ich bereits dort und kann es Jedem nur wärmstens empfehlen. Natürlich spricht mit demnach auch das Szenario des Brettspiels zu 100% an. Wobei die Stadt Brügge hier eigentlich nur Mittel zum Zweck ist, denn eigentlich stehen die mittelalterlichen Stadtbewohner mit Mittelpunkt. Durch Karten werden diese Personen dargestellt und hierbei ist jede Person einzigartig und kann auf 5 unterschiedliche Arten genutzt und eingesetzt werden. 1. Geld sammeln 2. Handlanger rekrutieren 3. Bedrohung vermindern 4. Den Kanal ausbauen 5. Ein Haus bauen und schlussendlich eben diesen Charakter in das Haus einziehen lassen. Brügge liefert sehr viele Strategien und ist wirklich Variantenreich. Ja, es ist auch ein etwas Glück im Spiel (ziehe ich die richtige Karte, welche Würfel wurden gewürfelt) und ja, es ist auch etwas destruktiv, aber das macht mir bei Brügge nix aus. Es ist ein tolles Spiel!

Like Macao and Amerigo, this feels like a 'risk mitigation' game by Feld. Of course there's randomness with the die rolls and card draws, but I suspect one of the important strategies is to set yourself up so that you can always do something productive regardless of which cards come up or what die rolls occur. In my first game, I did a poor job of that -- I was heavily focused on the blue die and blue cards, and when the blue die rolls were poor and no blue cards were available for a couple of turns, I was toast.

Overall there's nothing groundbreaking here -- and I like Macao and Amerigo more -- but Bruges is still fun.

This one is a keeper. The random cards and players will make this one feel different with each play. A really great euro style game that allows a user a lot of liberty in decison making each turn.

Disappointing. This game didn't feel like a Feld game at all. Really needs 3 or 4 people, because with 2 it becomes very one-sided very quickly due to the turn order track. Didn't feel as fully fleshed-out as I would have wanted it to be.

A very typical Feld with lots of scoring opportunity. I find it quite interesting because of all the interaction between the cards, and there is a right balance between competition and personal development.

It is also easy to teach, and every games are different because of the large variety of cards. I quite like this one!

Only one play (2 player) thus far; pretty, but didn't inspire a lot of enthusiasm.  There is a lot of variety in the cards, so much so that it seems difficult to formulate a strategy.

Very clever card game in medieval Bruges. You have to overthink a lot of options while you can only perform very few actions per turn. It's a Feld game so you need to play it multiple times to master it and once you do, I guess gameplay can go very quick... Nice artwork too, which is a rarity for a Feld game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Each round, players first draw five colored cards from two stacks. Five colors of dice are rolled, which tell you what you can do with those cards. On a player's turn, they can sell a card for gold (corresponding to the die rolled for that color), recruit 2 workers of that color,  build a canal of that color, build a house of that color, hire a person, or discard a threat. 

Based on the dice rolls, you also have to decide if you want to spend money to go up on influence. You also have to compete for majority in canals, people and influence. The twist is once you have gotten the majority, you can never lose those points even when someone surpasses you later in the game. 

The theme of the game is based on the Belgain town of Bruges. This Stefan Feld game is very tense, and engaging, with a myriad of possibilities. There are 166 person cards, so there is certainly no lack of variety.

I've really enjoyed my playings of this so far. It's hard to follow a particular script, and the different characters in the game might change how you play. I'd like to get many more plays under my belt to feel comfortable with the range of characters. There are many different approaches to the game as well, and want to play more to get exprienced with the strategies.

Hmm. Played a couple times and for the most part, I like how multiuse card play is pretty interesting. I feel like with 2, it lacks something...it either feels exceptionally short or some cards lose even more power and it becomes moreso zero sum and not as interesting. So Id prefer this at 3 and 4. There can be a bit of downtime at 4 though. I also feel like card draw is decently luck based. But I like the design and principles of the game and found it interesting for the most part.

After at least 5 plays, I have some issues with the game. The color of some cards and workers is a little difficult to tell and it annoys me. Also, its multiuse cards in the sense that each card does different things...but each card does the same different things except one effect. I dont know how much I like this as a lot of them can be very weak or not interesting (like get 2 workers which feels comparatively weak). I still prefer this to other games' cards like San Juan which only do about two or three similar tings but I dont know how much I like it. I esp dislike the two workers effect because I dislike using workers to activate the hired peoples. For one, Id prefer resources thematically, and for another, the infinity effects tend to be better long term than worker activations imo. The canal strategy also isnt that interesting pointwise.

The biggest issue is the luck of the draw and lack of coherent strategy. Your opening hand and every few turns initially will determine whether youll even get a strategy rolling or youll just need to rely on tactically drawing hands. Drawing the right colors is important too but thats a fair bit of chance if youll draw the right ones you need for your turn. And even then the abilities may not mesh when you do.

The main things I want in this game are: more interesting ways to multiuse the cards and a way to get a decent strategy going/not rely so heavily on card draw. I prefer startegic games, not tactical.

In addition, the coloration and worker colors is very annoying at times.

The wealth of options that this card-driven game gives you is astounding...and bit overwhelming, at first.

Every card has a character with a unique ability on it, one of five colors, and the ability to use five different generic abilities that are dependent on the color it is.  This can confuse a new player because there are so many unique abilities that will wind up just being used for their generic ability.

You also can chase points in a few different ways, canals, the prestige track, and the cards themselves.

The game really is fun once you can wrap your head around the possibilities.

Another Feld that is a hit for me and won I'd like to own. The game plays a little longer than is listed on the box, but has some nice interactions, card combos, and cleverness to be one that is worth owning. It is really more of a card game than a board game, but does have small board elements.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
Like Macao, its flavor comes from the cards that drive it, there's punishment for poor management, everyone shares the same dice rolls, and it blossoms on subsequent plays. It also plays in about half the time as Macao, and in fact could end very suddenly (like it did for us on a first play). Not many games fall into the high strategy/fast playing time quadrant, especially games that are not auction games, so Bruges scores mad points with me.

Stefan Feld makes new games like Taco Bell makes new food.  Take the same 3-5 elements, rearrange them, and stuff them in a flour tortilla.  And if you're not looking for flavor, it'll get you by.  But it'll never earn 3 Michelin.

If you like Feld's elements and the way he usually arranges them, you'll love Bruges.  But let's not pretend there's anything new here.

VPs earned by erecting buildings and hiring people to stay in them, by building canal segments and completing canals first and by advancing on a prestige track symbolizing the wealth of the citizens. All of the above cost money, some of the hired people need workers to be active, and buildings also cost workers. Buildings and different people are represented by colored cards, loads of them that give this game its variety and flavor. As this is a Feld design there are also threats that need to be thwarted throughout the game. Loads of cards also means heavy luck of the draw in this case. The luck factor is mitigated by fast play.

¡Great game! After reading the rules, I knew it would please me, but I did not expect that much.

You have plenty of options each turn, but the game advances at a great pace, you barely have enough time to think your next move.

As all Felds, there are many paths to victory, but I do not think this is a "points salad", at least not as much as other games. 

The replayability is huge, each game will be completely different.

The luck factor is important too, there are characters that are wonderful in certain moments.

My best Feld, along with Burgundy.

Gioco di Feld simpatico e veloce e decisamente vario per via dell'alto numero di carte che rendono le partite molto differenti e le strategie variabili. Mi lascia solo un po' perplesso la forte incidenza del caso soprattutto se non entrano per diversi turni le carte del colore necessario, ho passato intere partite ad aspettare carte gialle che non mi sono mai arrivate. A parte questo dettaglio il gioco è molto godibile per partite veloci e tranquille.

Played the game a few weeks ago and was unimpressed, especially so with the canals which felt really unconnected and tacked on. Played it again last night with the new expansion. This time I enjoyed it much more as it integrated the canals nicely into rest of the game and set up nice feldian combos.

However, after two and a half hours I set myself up for a massive 11 point last turn which would have easily won me the game and was thwarted by another player randomly "drawing and immediately playing" a take-that character card into his house which took away my worker and screwed me over. These cards have no place in a Feld. Maybe if it were a shorter game, but not in something this long and intricate. It wouldn't have been so bad if he would have blindly drawn a card that randomly gave him enough points to win, which is also possible unfortunately, it was that the card let him destroy my engine that I painstakingly set up. Frustrating experience.

(It's like playing one of Feld's better games except other players can reach over from time to time and move your pieces around and/or take them.)

RATING: 4
Doesn't really click for me mainly due to some things that just felt randomly added and didnt tie into the overall game that well for me: As it is mainly based on the cards the part before the card playing phase and the whole canal builduing seemed often too independent of what's going on with the cards itself.
The multi-use card mechanism I really liked and for me that would have been enough to make it a nice game, but there just for me is a disconnect between that and what's going on on the board to an extend. That's why I think I would prefer it if it would be stripped down to just the cards and the dice randomising them, which is a nice addition. I don't need the rest of the "point salad" though.

Not the most engaging Feld I've ever played. It must take an incredibly high level of play and/or tremendous luck to get out the high level cards and use them effectively.

Base game feels like it's missing content, which was poached by the expansion. (I mean, come on, the boats? You're telling me Herr Feld built a game where 1's and 2's and 5's and 6's on the dice do something, but 3's and 4's don't?)

If AsmoZ-Man refuses to reprint it, I may just sell or trade it while it's valuable. I won't really be missing a lot that can't be better covered by his other games.

I really want to like this game more than I do.  I normally love engine building games and cards having multiple uses.  I really don't like how random the types of cards that you draw are and how difficult it is to get around that.  You might have 2 or 3 turns in a row where you need a specific color of card and not have a chance to draw it.  Also if you don't see a character with a draw power there is no generic action to draw more cards.  I just wish there was a generic way to draw cards if you don't like what you are seeing, and I think that is my main gripe with the game.

RATING: 8.7
Finally....After Macao this game could get my second 10. Waited soooo long. Just because of the artwork it deserves it. Now after my first play I will keep with the 10. It has a high replayability just because of the 165 cards wich are (as in Macao) not used in every game. I love that!

Edit: After 8 games I rated it down to 8.7. The game is still an excellent piece of replayability and artwork. But it has an issue that let it become short off a 9: The open card deck lets following cards shift while drawing from the deck and opens the possibility of having a glance of what cards might follo. Depending on how much you can see, it influences the gameplay. And if someone wants to cheat, he can do...

As of Mai 2017 (32 games played!) I rated it back a 8.7  after it slowly slipped down to a 8.5. The publishers solved the problem with the shifting cards by preparing card holders, which were easy to receive just by asking them. Now every game contains them. Well done.

RATING: 7
Has that 'generic' quality typical of euros, where the game feels rather detached from its subject matter (you can't really learn much about the real Bruges from this game, besides the fact it has canals), but is nevertheless enjoyable. Feels more tactical than strategic, since so much of your approach will depend on the cards you happen to draw, especially those cards which combine with others to give bonus points.

Como era de se esperar, tem mecânicas diferentes muito interessantes. Pelo review, parece que ele tem um problema que identifiquei no Macao: as cartas têm condições que são difíceis e até mesmo não garantidas de se obter. Se for na extensão de Macao, desisto do jogo.

A really nice, clever, elegant Euro with enough luck to move it out of sterile territory and into a fun space - enough to warrant groans, cheers and risk management but generally without being overwhelming ... maybe. Draw cards over 5 colours which allow you to do a variety of things on your turn, and which will change depend on the number rolled in each of the 5 colours. If yellow's a 5, now's the time maybe to trade it that yellow card for 5 gold rather than to acquire 2 yellow meeples, which can be used to activate a yellow card ability on one of my buildings. Or maybe spend it on the next canal building space which requires a yellow card. Or build a yellow house in which I can later build a card power. And so on, using the cards you drew at the start. There's lots of choices which vary throughout, and every turn has a different twist dependent on the dice rolled and the cards that were on offer when you drew from the two decks available. Clean rules, easy to teach, good game length. Lots of different card power combos to explore. You can have a strategy, but it'll require tactical decisions each turn on whether to progress it or change direction. I liked it a lot.

Enjoyed my one play of it so far and would like to play again.  However, I do rate it a notch or two below most other Feld games.  As is typical of Feld, there are several moving parts to the game but I find other of his designs to be more tied together.  Also, I am not a fan of a few of the "take that" cards.  I do not mind my position being diminished/destroyed by the skilled planning of another player.  I am not a fan, however, of a building getting destroyed simply because you drew a card that says you can.  That type of interaction, to me, just seems snarky.

Bruges is best described as a card combo game, though that doesn't really do it justice.  You're trying to get out cards through a multi-step process, and those cards have text that can allow you to do a variety of different things.  Meanwhile, you're trying to build canals for points, advance on a track for end-game points, and get rid of tokens that will harm you if they build up too much.  Everyone basically has the same options, so sometimes you feel like you need to do certain things just to keep up with your opponents.  The randomness factor is a little high because of card draws.  It doesn't really feel like anything else I've played.

Smooth, card-driven Feld-design. On your turn there are tons of options that you could do with the cards. But as in Notre Dame you will need to pay attention to potential dangers. And what your opponents are doing, so that you don't get behind with those majority tiles.

As with Notre Dame, it takes some plays before the game really starts to shine. But it is addictive from the start and fast playing.

If I should rank the Feld-games I have played this would be the order:

1. Notre Dame
2. Trajan
3. Bruges
4. The castles of Burgundy
5. Macao (far behind Burgundy)

Haven't played Bruges enough to grasp the entirety of it, but so far it is very enjoyable. All about colors doing a bunch of different things, playing cards to get points, mitigate disasters, gain money etc. It's a true point salad at times, and the games I've played often feel very tight point-wise. With the many cards, the strategies can differ quite radically, but there is an element of luck (draw of the cards) which has to be considered. Good playtime, wish it had a bit less components to streamline it further, maybe a redesign of the threats.

Update: After a few more plays, I can say that when luck is a bit more on your side, it's a great game. If you keep drawing the wrong cards, it just feels like a game of luck, no tactics/strategies involved. But when that balance strikes, which it does often enough, the game is a really enjoyable experience. Good playtime as well.

This feels like the game picks a player at random to have all the fun and a player to have no fun and the other players are somewhere in between.  Very very swingy and not a ton of play to get out of that trap in my opinion.

Still, could be enjoyable for some and the game is incredibly pretty.

This comes after a single play, so take everything here with a grain of salt. Bruge is a card game about building canals. The clever part of the game is that each card allows a player to take up to 7 different actions. Most of these are resource-gathering actions of some sort, but a player can also play the card into his own tableau as a person, which gives the player some sort of special ability. This may be a one time effect, an ongoing action, or a discount on future actions. There are many different cards and a major focus of the game is creating interesting combos of cards and using that synergy to gain an edge. However, this is also where the game fell a little flat for me. The combos seem quite basic, and there is little a player can do to search for cards that fit well with a given strategy. And in the end, players are mostly earning points from (1) having built the canals by spending money and playing the appropriate card; (2) advancing on the reputation track by paying a randomly determined amount of money; and (3) playing cards into their tableau. 

I think here Feld goes away from the pattern of scoring points for everything that we've seen in his recent games. The trouble is, in Bruge we're score points for only a few things, and the scoring is done in such a straightforward manner that it feels rather dull. I'm sure I'd enjoy a few more plays in order to explore other card combos, but overall, this is a pass for me.

Initial thought on this game is "shit I got bad cards". I can see why people were saying the players are at the mercy of the draw and there is too much luck in this game. My fiancee got an early warden down so she kept on building canals to get rid of her threat counters and while I struggle to maintain a balance between income and threat while trying to keep up with her on the people cards. Final score 49 to 36. I've lost by a lot. I kind of knew that I'd lost 2/3rd of the way into the game just because I failed to get any engine going while she has the fire-eater with the warden to fend off any disasters. I am sure the rating will go up once I am familiar with the game. 

---- Update ----
This is the second game that forced me to dream about it after playing! After losing to fiancee I've dreamed about strategies of this game in my dream all night. LOCO!

---- Update ----
After 4 plays this game surpasses both Stone Age and Airlines Europe because it has a bit more meat than those two games. All 3 games are in my top 8~10 but this one wins out. They all share a similarity - they are very tactical in nature.

After Bora Bora and Rialto not being the 'great' games I expected them to be, this one is again 'bingo' for me. It's also totally in the style of HiG with short rules, easy to explain, but just enough options to keep this game interesting all the time. Very nice mechanism with the threat-markers you'll receive being from the dice who will give you lots of money and a clever idea that every card is a person who does something you would like to have, but you wanna/must use the card for all other kind of things. Great game concept!

The language dependancy is however a bit too much for me (it's the same level as with Macao), some I'm going to wait for the English release, or, who knows, maybe even  the Dutch release (common 999 Games, WGG,...).

Edit: Thank you White Goblin Games :-)

Very fun card game with beautiful components. Board looks very nice, dice are used too and every card looks unique. Every card can be used in multiple ways. Player interaction is moderate (through special abilities of the cards). Playtime is under one hour with three people. I think it plays well with 2,3 or 4 (but I only played it with 3). Definitely a very good Family game too, because the rules are elegant and short. Only complaint: the colour of the components is important in the game. One of my friends is colour blind and he had a harder time to identify the Cards colour.

One of the worst Stefan Feld games in my opinion (Macao being the worst).

This game is okay mechanically, but a pain to play

It's more of a tactical game than a strategy game, because you try to react the best as you can in the present situation rather than planning too far ahead which is not a bad thing in itself, but it's how roles are played that it's annoying. There are indeed some luck involved. Some cards are too powerful for how much they cost. The luck of the draw can be absolutely frustrating ! You can lose the game by simply drawing atrocious cards, while your opponents gets good ones. With all those characters with different abilities, it was impossible to balance them all, which is an aspect that somehow can break the game.

I liked it at first, but after repeated plays, there's too much luck involved for my taste for how long this game lasts.

Great game, plays for me like a mixture of Dominion and the "older" Stefan Feld games, although this is a little lighter than for example Bora Bora. 
If you can live with the luck factor involved via card drawing and throwing dice mechanisms, this will be a great game for you. Additionally,it plays rather quickly and has a high replayability factor due all the different character cards included.

Luck can play a big enough factor that it can screw you no matter how well you manage your plays. It's not a bad game, it's just too random for Kel and I. However, I do enjoy every once in awhile. It's definitely more of a tactical game than it is strategic. 

Maybe the expansion coming up can breathe new life to this game that is already dead to us.

Edit: The expansion didn't really fix anything for us. It's still random as all get out and still offers very little luck mitigation. Even Rialto has less luck than this.

RATING: 7
A little lighter than most Feld games, but fans will recognize some trademarks (reputation track, threats to contend with).

Basically a card game in which each card can be used for several purposes. The cards are of 6 different colors and those colors are visible on the inverse as well. You must draw a hand of 5 at the beginning of each round from 2 stacks -- selecting the color card that you want from the two available top cards. The draw is done before 6 dice bearing the same colors as the cards are rolled to determine which colors are threats (and can be mitigated by the same color card) and how much each color is worth in money this round. Basically, it's a crap shoot. You have no way of knowing which cards are the most valuable until after you select them and the dice are rolled.

As a result, this leans more towards family than gamers game and more towards tactical than strategic. It's still an enjoyable puzzle to optimize your hand; just don't expect anything orbit altering.

I like how the cards have multiple uses depending on what you want to do, and how their effects can stack and build on each other.

The setup process is frustrating as you take a big stack of cards, split it into five even piles and then two of those piles are your draw decks. 

The reputation track mechanic isn't well thought out as it can be impossible to gain the lead from someone. This is troublesome because it's worth points inherently but also it gives one of the three 'majority bonuses' for the player in the lead.

In the game there are disasters that can wipe away your progress, and the disasters are assigned randomly. Once you get your third of a kind, you suffer the negative effect. There is an in game threat mitigation mechanic but it relies on you having the right colored card in hand at the right time, and since you can only hold 1 card between rounds, this can be difficult. Additionally, not all the disasters are of equal severity.

Some of the personalities are too powerful. In particular the 12 cost cards who are the most expensive guys in the game, have very unbalancing effects.

My wife likes this game and I am still to beat her at it. 

However, this "Point-salad, Play for an hour and a half to see at the very end who scored a couple points more than the others" mechanics is apparently not for me. Take my opinion with a grain of salt, though, because I also think Stephan Feld's other hit game - Castles of Burgundy is a mediocre game too.

Update: At the third play, I started to grasp the fine mechanics of this game. The card play is where this game is at, specifically in the nobles you put out. It is, at its core, an engine building game where you have to juggle 6 currencies (gouldens and 5 colours of workers, which really are a kind of currency each). That and the fact that you normally play all your cards but one drives me to the edge of AP, although I am not normally known to suffer AP.

The fact, that player interaction is almost non-existent and that the game seems to normally end with an unexciting difference of a couple of points for the winner to show for his/her cunning play is what still makes this game somewhat of a "meh" for us. 

This game gives me a similar vibe to Guildhall - a favourite of ours, but what Brügge offers in terms of clever-combo card gameplay during an entire game, Guildhall does in each round while also having that confrontational edge both my wife and me enjoy.

Played 3 times. Almost a year after my last play, I feel no desire to ever play it again.

Bruges (with expansion): far more flexibility in mitigating luck of the cards, raising the game up substantially in my estimations.

A szabályt én követtem el és egy kicsit ezért közelebb áll a szívemhez. 
Tudnék mondani számomra kedvesebb és jobb mechanikájú Feld-et is, de nagyon nem rossz játék, valamiért eddig túl feszült légkör alakult ki játék közben. Nem tudom miért.
Ezért egy kicsit ritkán kerül elő. (lehet, hogy csak mindig rossz passzban ültünk le mellé.

Nov 2014: Thanksgiving 2014 purchase. It is one of the few games that can cause an emotional response in me. My best plans wiped in moments. I enjoy this game.

Feb 2016: I'm lowering for lack of plays. We played it lots in 2014-2015 and I think it just needs a rest. It was 8.8 but I'm dropping 0.3.

Jan 2018: We've pulled this out as a 'work night' choice. Considerable random but "that's ok" for its length.

Honestly, I seem to love Stefan Feld games. At least the five I own. My family likes games without a lot of "take-that" towards the other players and his games allow multiple paths to victory without getting in each others way too much. Some people love this, like me, others like the opposite.

This one does have some player interaction but it is balanced by using one of your actions and making you miss out on doing something that betters your own game. I also love Carl Chudyk and I believe Feld said somewhere that this game takes some inspration from Glory to Rome, so that is also cool.

Perhaps the game I like the least from Feld. Partly because I got to play Oracle of Delphi first, which in my opinion has completely killed Bruges. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Despite the vast number of choices you'll be presented in Bruges, the game is really rather simple. Gameplay boils down to dice and cards of matching colors being played or laid out to create powerful combos. All the while, players will be racing to hold majority in a handful of titles throughout the game and racing to be first to finish their canals. It's mostly a game of reacting to your neighbors play and doing the same thing, but better. Teaching the game is a breeze thanks to some very smart design choices.
That being said, I think this is one of Feld's weaker titles. It could be very strong, if not for a handful of overpowered cards. These particular cards don't even require smart play or specific combos to pull off, you simply have to be lucky enough to draw them.
Still, I enjoy playing Bruges. I'm hoping future expansions will fix the balance issues.

Definitely a good game, but a little more fiddly than I would have liked. It feels like it would take an investment of a few games before you feel like you had a handle on this one.

But a great use of cards.

The expansion makes canal building a more attractive strategy to pursue.  Although in our first game, the guy who went aggressively after canals won the game (base game only).

I've not played this very many times, and never with 4 (once with 2, the other 3-4 times with 3), but my overall impression each time has been disappointment. It may grow on me with more plays, but I'm not sure when they'll happen, given how many other new and newish games we have that I'm far more excited to play. I'm a big Feld fan and also very keen on card games, so this one sounded brilliant - yet I found it fell somewhat flat in play. I think a large part of the problem is that it's so short - I've nothing against short games, provided they have plenty of strategy, and this game isn't particularly lacking there, but it does mean that you've got very little time to set up any kind of "engine" of tableau cards to generate VPs. The game seems to end before you've really got going - I realise this is a feature of the game and one that players have to adapt to, but I find it a bit jarring here. And the game, while definitely good, doesn't massively engage me, for whatever reason. Still, it provides interesting choices, and with 165 unique cards (albeit with many having similar effects to each other) is not lacking in replayability. It's a good game - hence the 7 rating - but I just feel that I was expecting an even better one.

The game is different from Macao but feels like it does enough things similarly that it's not worth it to me to own both. I enjoyed Bruges but I enjoy Macao more but it's more of a statement about how good Macao is rather than a negative on Bruges though. If you think Macao is a bit long or too much for what you are looking for, definitely consider Bruges but otherwise I'd go for Macao.

A bit simple and dull for a Feld game.  Sure there are tons of different cards, and each can be played in a multitude of ways, but the choices are surprisingly limited at times.

G/f picked this one up.

Enjoyed it a lot more than the second time around, but I will wait until I pick up the expansion next week before I play it again. Really anxious to see what that brings to the table.

7plays: I think it's a fun game, and there's a lot of chances for great combo chains and clever plays. The artwork is phemomenal, the board is unecessary and tbh, the game could be played without it. But it does do a good job of bringing some flavor to the theme. The expansion is great, the ships add a nice extra layer to the gameplay. More cards is always welcome im a card game, and the rest of the modules I haven't used. My g/f loves it, I like it. It's not something am crazy about but I'll play it with her whenever she wants because she plays all my stuff.

Components: Very good throughout, cards feel good, cardboard is good, regular wooden pieces.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Edit: subsequent plays have confirmed my starting idea: this is not a game that allow you to pick a strategy and focus on it, but it's instead a game of limited resources that will force you to try and get the best you can from every hand. It's definetely not a game for those who likes games with low or no luck. But once you accept that you can be easily screwed by dices or hands, however, you can play it more consciously, and get better results.

-------------------

This game is a fine demonstration of how design can go awry even when the premises are good. Why in the world, in a game that already got:

1. A mostly unused board in spite of being sufficiently large to possibly host more things
2. Dices
3. Workers and coins as resources
4. Lot of components, pawns, tokens and the like

...i have to use cards to do absolutely EVERYTHING? Why i can't just have a "merchant" token or the like that i can move on that board to do actions like getting money, hire workers, getting reputation, build canals and so on, while saving cards for the houses/citizens mini game (which is easily the best part of the game and more than often perfectly sufficient to get a win)? Having cards which usage is so overloaded would make sense if the game would consist of almost cards only, but heck, there are tons of other things here anyway. Just give them an use that is as much as interesting as characters are. Most often then not, the entire game revolves about getting (almost by chance only) a deadly combination of characters and other cards of the right colors to get the other resources you need to put them into play. Even if the other mechanics can allow other players to keep up with points, they are so dull and uninspired (expecially the reputation one) that is just natural for a player to ignore the board and focus on the houses/citizens thing.

Trajan, as a Stefan Feld game where you have a hand of cards but only as a part of the mini game dedicated to them, it's a way better game, more cohesive, and with more interaction between players.

I love this game.  Every decision comes with an opportunity cost.  You never feel completely settled knowing that you have adequate resources to fully execute your strategy.

I very much like the simplicity of this game, from the rules to the quick turns to the five easy actions and straightforward people abilities. Everything is streamlined and the points salad doesn't really hit until the final reckoning. Bruges is a lovely backdrop for the game. The people cards are just varied enough to prevent the game from getting boring, and you play few enough and see enough that it feels like you have some meaningful choices.

The reality is that I'm not sure the choices are as meaningful as they first appear. Everything is so balanced that no matter which direction you take, players from a wide range of abilities always end up within a few points of each other. It might be that there are good moves and a few very obvious suboptimal moves that it's just hard to make a bad move.

Anyway, the ride is interesting enough to make this a family game that will see repeated plays and repeated requests to the table. It's very light, very much a Feld salad, but interesting enough to make you want to explore the cards over a few plays.

Local Feldian decided that this is the best attempt of me liking a Feld. And he was right: Feld on cards is Feld I can tolerate. Even enjoy. 

It's a tableau building game crossed with some old eurogame stuff, like additional mechanisms and ways to get points the game could live without (canals? that thingy in the middle of the board? the "goal" tiles?). The card synergy is rather simple - yes each card has multiple uses which makes the game feel like a colour coded spread sheet cut into cards and shuffled. The biggest lack is a sort of card drawing engine. 

But okay - mostly you'll build your own tableau and see what you can do in any given game. Very MPS. The biggest problem I have with the game ain't even about Feld. It's Metzel's uninspired generic artwork dipped in much too many layers of brown. Seasons still looks better, yet Bruges has more theme (well Seasons really has none) - you're building your city district and that's that. 

As far as characters on cards go, I liked Dominare's ones with their ethnic names and flavour text better. 

Rating down to 1.0 because: uninspired. Yeah it's a crime.  Visuals have a kinda comfy feel, but doesn't save the lack of "why does this game exist at all" problem.

RATING: 7
Played once. Seems nice enough. I initially thought that the disasters were simply too frequent, a drawback Feld tends to overuse in his games, but they were not as bad as they first appeared. I am not a fan of "attack cards", and might remove them from the game or limit their use somehow.

I also see no earthly reason not to roll dice before picking cards. The benefit is not great, but there is no drawback.

RATING: 6
Played thrice; once with 4P and twice with 3P. Bruges is entertaining in a typical Feld-like way where you are pulled in several directions at once – should you build canals, hire people, obtain workers, earn money or dispel threats? There are also elements of racing and area majorities wedged in for good measure.

As a fairly light design, Bruges is a generally satisfactory tactical game. Luck of the draw is central to this game, but there is a skill to working with the cards you have been dealt with. (It's also a skill I'm completely missing out on.) Unlike most Feld games, Bruges doesn't have a 'hook' or a mechanism that really stands out.

Clearly suffers from hundreds-of-different-cards-syndrome. It's a game for people who want to have the feeling that they played an immensely complex game, when in reality they only played a game with immensely complex text and rules to hide the fact how random it all is.

In other words: Don't even bother trying to find a good strategy, because you won't get the right cards for it anyway. And that you can keep only one card between rounds makes planning ahead even more pointless. (Which, I assume, is a clever ruse so that players don't need to *actually* think too much and can spend more time flattering their egos for having understood the rules.)

Every game has a target group, and I guess there are many people who will like this game. Good for them. I'm just not among that group. (In fact, I actually enjoyed the first few rounds of the game we played, until I reached that point where I wanted to go for a certain strategy and realized that there was nothing I could do to get the cards I needed. The cards you get basically determine your strategy.)

Hits a sweet spot for me as far as complexity and theme go.  Surprising because I usually dislike complexity-simply-because-there's-a-bunch-of-cards-with-different-powers and renaissance Europe has been done to death, of course.  I guess I was in a good mood for my one play.  Need to play more games to see how I REALLY feel.

Feld tavalyi játéka kellemes meglepetés volt számomra. Egy könnyed kártyás játék. Minden körben 5 kártyából indulva 4-et használunk fel különböző akciókra. Emberszerzésre, pénzszerzésre, katasztrófajelző eldobásra, csatornaépítésre vagy házépítésre. Emberre a házépítésre van szükségünk. Egy kártya egyik oldalán egy mesterember van egy jó tulajdonsággal, a másikon pedig egy ház. Így a kártyák sokfelhasználásúak. Pénz az emberek házba tevésére kell, illetve csatornaépítésre. A katasztrófajelzőből 3 kijövése után ér minket valami negatívum, ez a Notre Dame patkányinváziójának itteni megoldása. 175 különböző kártya van jó és kevésbé jó tulajdonságú emberekkel. A játék tulajdonképpen arról szól, hogy ezeket az embereket hogy menedzseljük. Ez a kártyás rész pedig a Macaóból köszön vissza. A játék abszolút nem bonyolult, a kártyák ismerete után gyorsan pörgethető és valószínűleg minden játékosszámmal jól működik. Kimondottan tetszett. Egyedül a kártyák közti különbségeket éreztem néha erősnek, tehát szerencsefaktor bőven van benne, de mivel nem hosszú és nem is nehéz a játék szerintem arányos ehhez.

RATING: N/A
I had heard that Glory to Rome was Stefan Feld's inspiration for this game, so I initially was looking forward to this game.  Finally got a chance to play a 2-player game, and it fell completely flat with me.  

The focus of the game should have been on hiring the various people on the cards to build up a nice tableau/engine, but Feld added way too many Feld-esque distractions to the game that make it a messy point salad: threats, the canal track, the progress track, etc.  

I managed to win my only game of it without really having any idea what I was doing.

RATING: 5
I think I underestimated the length of time that I had to get things done, as there are some serious race elements to this in order to get majorities. The game certainly has a luck element with how the dice come up, although I think that can be mitigated with creating a diverse set of colors and how you ultimately decide to use those colors.

UPDATE: The game feels unpolished to me. There are too many different card types so that there is quite a bit of luck in being able to get a couple that interact well together. Combine this with a game that actually is too short to really feel like you make adequate progress and overall, this just isn't something that I'd like to play, in spite of the novel way in which the dice are used.

It's another Feldian game, with plenty of ways to score, but this is on the lighter, faster, more tactical end of the scale. It's lighter than I prefer -- I would much rather play his other longer, heavier games -- but it's pretty solid for it's play time.

A significant part of the game is managing the cards: without the right cards, you're going to have a hard time accomplishing anything! The cards come in 5 colors, and are people that allow you to do stuff (use colored workers to do something, earn coins or VP or something, etc.). The cards are available for drafting from 2 face up decks: you can see the topmost cards from both decks. You need appropriately colored cards to do the various things in the game: build canals, earn like-colored workers, advance on a VP track, etc. The cards can be placed face down as buildings (using those workers), or played face up onto previously placed buildings -- at which point you can use the varied character powers. 

Sadly, I don't remember more details. There was some kind of catastrophe thing where you could see it coming, there were dice you rolled which set the prices of each of the colored cards (and advanced a catastrophe), there was a track that everyone wanted to move forward on ... it all worked well and I'd like to try it again, but given the choice I'd go for a longer game.

This is a very Feld-ian game.  It includes a fun and unique dice mechanic and a plethora of different ways to score victory points.  The only thing it is missing is a brutally punishing personality.  This game is actually very colorful and feels reasonably light-hearted.

The game consists of drawing cards of 5 different colors and taking one of 6 different actions with those cards.  Like I said, in common Feld fashion all of these actions are in service to scoring you points in different areas.  The most versatile and, for me, best part of the game are the different people that appear on each of the cards.  Each one of them has a different special ability and where 90% of the game "lives".  I'm a sucker for variety and variability in a game and think this gives the game a LOT of replay value.  There are combos and interesting tactics to take with the different people cards.

There is an interesting decision mechanic built into the way cards are played as well.  Each round you have to use 4 of your cards and you simply won't be able to play all the people you like to because only 1 of your 5 cards carries over the next turn.  The planning on which of the 6 actions to take with the cards is reasonably deep, thoughtful and for me, quite a bit of fun.  The game is also going to feel very different every time you play and you can take varying paths to victory.

I will say that this game requires a few "learning plays" as I like to call them to really get to the meat of it.  With so much variety and so many different actions to take that score you points in so many ways it can get a little overwhelming and the best plays can be hard to see until you've worked out how exactly everything fits together.  Despite that, this is now one of my favorite Feld games and definitely one that can stand a lot of mileage.

I'd also like to point out that it plays at a reasonably good clip as well, under an hour including setup and explanation.

I find this game hard to describe, but I enjoyed it. The multiuse cards were very interesting, you could use them to build part of the canal, gain money, build a house, remove a disaster, gain workers, or for the benefit listed on the card. It made for some interesting choices as you could only use the card for one action, even though you wanted to do them all!

I felt like it needs another play just to understand all the synergies of the cards.

As much as the card colour selection is interesting at the outset, I just found the game too dry, and a little too light.  Little meaningful player interaction.

Need to play this one again although it's a typical Feld game. The ways to score VP are more than many and there are lots of mechanics not always related one to another - my feeling. I liked the color system in the cards and the tiny interaction provided by them and the dice. Time of play is perfect! It can be a good addiction to my collection.

Not for me at all. I worked my butt off to try to get a combo going using a relatively expensive card with a triggered effect; Did I draw any cards that had synergy with my plan? Not even one. I really needed money to accomplish my goals part way through the game; my hand was filled with red and yellow cards and the red and yellow dice? one and two pips. This game is filled with random screwage that is brought on by the game. There is no planning or strategy. Tactically weak play as well.

RATING: 8.5
A really great Euro that offers so many opportunities to do stuff and get points but of course you can't do everything in time so: choices. I have yet played too little to see all strategic potential but I want to go back and explore more and that's what makes a good game. 
I like the mechanism where the cards in your hands can and need to be used for so many things, they are exchange currency first and second the characters, again, choices of which character to keep and which to discard to get workers, money etc. Plus, I know the theme is pasted on but I love that Feld chose to place it in Bruges.

Mechanically okay, but too much randomness for this type of game. It's also too long for what it is and the luck of the draw can put you out of the game pretty early on. The cards are also pretty unbalanced, with cards clearly better than others. What a total piece of crap.

No comeback mechanic at all which can turn the game into a real drag and a painful experience.

One of the worst Stefan Feld games out there with Bora Bora & Rialto imo.

This game is like a bunch in the face in a box.  It is perhaps the meanest game I have ever played where the meanness comes from the game itself, and not the other players.

A few things about this game that I really like: 
- cards have multiple uses, so there is rarely something that you can't do
- dice affect everyone, so there is no luck, only responding to a shared environment
- point salad; with many ways to collect victory points, you can decide your own strategy
- you don't have to maintain a majority to score it; you only need to have the majority at one point in the game

This is exactly how I imagined Belgium to be: full of people in houses, awash in canal construction, and with a high value placed upon personal influence.  (Or was that Holland I was thinking of?)  The only thing lacking was some of that famous (righfully!) Belgian beer.  So regarding game play, it's funny that I played Spyrium just a few days before playing this one because my comments for Spyrium could apply to Bruges: it's a very cleverly designed game that's as dry as a Dutchman.  The manner in which the dice and cards interact is brilliant (though I do wonder if designers of Euro-style games are competing to see who can design the game with the most number of ways to use a card).  It IS highly interactive for a Euro game, though I find it to be a frustrating sort of interaction as other players are constantly working toward preventing you meeting your goals (and vice versa, of course).  All in all, it's a great bit of game design that isn't a great amount of fun to play (for fans of thematic, narrative-rich games such as myself).  Game design: 4/5  Personal enjoyment: 2/5  Total: 6/10

RATING: 4
Feldian point-salad take on engine-building card games that's as frustratingly milquetoast as I should have expected.

Each round players draw up to five cards, of which four will be played; all cards have common uses (money, build canals, etc.) and, crucially, have a unique power. Some powers are persistent ("get 2 coins every time another player plays a person"), some one-off ("get 2 coins for every person you have in play") and some give end-game points ("2 points for every protector symbol"). There is a tiny amount of direct competition (majority bonuses) and a modicum of interaction (some cards steal from, leech from or otherwise inflict pain on opponents).

Card luck seems substantial: strong "engine" cards early in the game give a compounding advantage, while set-collection bonus cards are all but impossible to plan for.

This is frustrating, because while the game plays smoothly, it has all the drama of my own pleasant day-trip to Bruges, from the highlights (a peaceful beer tasting) to the crises (a rented bicycle that broke down and required a sunny, 10-minute canal-side walk back to the station). "Combo" sounds like too grand a term for the synergies on display, which are more about balanced-to-within-an-inch-of-their-life incremental advantage than the cavalcade of game-breakers that make up a game like Innovation.

There's nothing wrong with Bruges, but it's a lacklustre entry in a crowded field. I have never appreciated Race for the Galaxy more.

**

Update: No, there's something wrong with Bruges. Luck of the cards can be overwhelming and I see no reason to ever play it over the (vastly superior) competition.

Not much theme.  Fairly easy to learn and play.  No innovative mechanics.  Luck plays a part due to the card draw.  There is some player interaction, but does it poorly.  Game feels very random, hard to plan.  Fair components - colorful mounted board and wood tokens.  Color scheme is brutal to the eye though.  Cards are fairly durable with stereotypical overdone 16th century Eurogame artwork.  Game plays in about 90 minutes which feels alright.

Love the colorful dice. However, it can be very frustrating to be dealt a bunch of useless cards. The 12 point cards are game breakers, and if one comes out early, it's super depressing. It's also aggravating to not be able to build your canals and achieve your goals. It's made slightly more tolerable with house rules, but on the whole still a painful game for the losers.

A new Feld! And it's from Hans im Glueck! Yay! Too bad only the German is available at the moment, because there is a lot of German text on the cards. But with some sheets with translations next to us, we managed to play this. It did add some time to the length as looking up each and every card took some time.
The rules for this game are quite simple, but since you can use every card in 5 or so different ways, there are plenty of options for you to consider on your turn. The game doesn't drag though.
The game (like most Felds) seems to offer quite some strategies to try out, but the two players who used the cards most for the characters, where in the lead by a good margin, so judging from this first game, it seems like you can't ignore those.

I quite liked this first play and will be more than happy to play this again soon. And I'll probably add it to the collection at some point.

I've always quite liked the smaller, faster Feld games and Bruges falls into that category. As a result, I quite liked it, but found it a little dull in places, the card draw doesn't really offer any control at all and I'd really struggle to say how it would be any different play to play.

Very random, very tactical, but gives great fun. A card combo doesn`t gives you a win, the other players can get points from the board. Even if one player will be very lucky, the game is fast, so it doesn`t matter so much. Norhing really new, but i dont feel it`s the same like in all other games.

Edit: Still a entertaining game, but the canal strategy doesn`t work. Does it mean the card that give you bonuses for boilding canals are useless?

06-Nov-2013: Bruges should be played as a light-medium game, and not over-thought. I mean, most of the decisions are fairly tactical anyway.

02-Dec-2013: Impulse bought Bruges from Good Games. Slightly panicked recently when Milsims sold out. $84 :p

04-Dec-2013: Played Bruges with Cynthia last night. She thought it was so-so. "Nothing new" I think was her comment. I'm feeling a bit disappointed now :-p Still like the game, but got the feeling that this won't see as many plays as I'd like.

#518 Bruges joka mua feldiläisenä tietenkin kiinnosti. Liekö Matin ansiokas sääntöjenselitys, vai muuten vaan ihan hyvä fiilis, mutta kyllähän toi nyt maistui oikein erinomaiselta. Just sopivasti sellaista hyvää vibaa, että ei oo tuuripeli, mutta ei ihan tolkuton laskentakaan. En tiedä pääseekö ihan Notre Damen intuitio-levelille vai onko enemmän taktiikkapainotteinen, mutta oikein mielelläni pelaan uudestaan ja homman oitis itselle jos halavalla saan. 2.2.2016

Comme la plupart des Feld, j'ai l'impression qu'il a monté un jeu à partir de pièces détachées. Tout roule bien, mais on voit que ça a été reconstruit. Pas un défaut pour certains, mais personnellement je trouve que ça enlève la beauté de ses jeux.

Par contre, j'ai bien aimé la pige des cartes et leurs actions multiples.

Note stratégique: il y a des cartes pour attaquer les autres joueurs, mais on semble avoir avantage à ne pas le faire car il est assez simple de se défendre (et on fait souvent des points en le faisant) et l'attaquant perd des actions qu'il aurait pu utiliser pour se développer.

RATING: 8.8
I appreciate the depth of strategy in Bruges, and while simple it offers a complexity of tactical decisions and critical choices. It is a very, very tight game, particularly if the cards don't go your way. I'm not a big fan of the card draw system as theoretically it can essentially hose a player, devastatingly so, and is quite random with minimal control. But Bruges is all about planning, and planning for the worst. Tough decisions need to made, and plenty of sacrifices; will you cover all your bases, or take a risk? The random elements need to be beaten with careful preparation, and there are so many elements to juggle. For a simple game it can bring mind numbing AP, but I love it. It yearns for me to conquer it.

RATING: 7
I enjoyed Bruges although I'm not sure if it's deep enough to hold my attention for the long term. It felt quite a bit like Feld's earlier design Macao, but cleaner, more streamlined and with far better graphics. It's also shorter, with the downside being that all card draws are random, so you can't plan ahead as you can, at least a little, in Macao. A lot I like here, but random luck can really hose your game. The biggest examples of this are 1) You play a character who does something neat when you spend meeples of a certain color, but then you are never able to draw a card of that color to get the requisite meeples, or 2) You play a character who does something neat when you get a good die roll of a specific color, and that color never rolls a high number over the course of the game. Need to play this more to see where my rating finally shakes out, but definitely some mixed feelings here ...

Very interesting game -- Stefan Feld's take on Glory to Rome. Tons of cards (165 cards, all uniquely named, but there are several duplicate powers) will cause great variability. Since there are so many different cards and not all of them are available in a game, it might be tough or easy to get synergistic interactions between cards. Only thing I don't like is that it can be tough to get a sorely needed color of card since only 2 are available to choose from at a time; two of the games ended with somebody not able to get the needed color in the last 2-4 rounds. Still, it's a fun game and the threat markers make for some tough decisions.

Another Feld that's just Ho-Hum. Actually, that's how I feel about every Feld game that was released after Trajan, at least the ones I played. There's lots of options, there are tons of ways to score points, but it's just not possible to go for a strategy as the randomness of the dealt cards is massive. This is a game where you want to build an engine early on so you can midway through or at the end start with your victory point multipliers. But you can't plan anything. In  agricola at least you have to make the best of the cards dealt IN THE BEGINNINg. The cards there stay with you for the rest of the game, but you play 4 out of 5 cards here, sometimes 5 out of 5 and get five new random cards at the start of the next round. There's not much room for saving up cards for later. Too bad if the cards you're dealt in the beginning are the ones to introduce victory point multipliers and the cards you get dealt at the end are the ones that build up an engine. The game definitely had its share of akward moments. Also, I strongly dislike the random market system. What if you don't happen to have cards with a high "retail value", as the "retail value" of the cards is determined randomly after you have drawn cards? That being said, it seems odd that I liked the implementation of yet another rather random mechanic, that is the inclusion of the threat tokens. Which is nothing else but the introduction and integration of a mild push-your-luck-element. Which (finding unique and innovative combinations of boardgame mechanics seems to be Felds most outstanding strength)) I find to be very clever and that results in a boardgame mix, that doesn't hurt too bad playing it and - despite feeling like a multiplayer solitaire's got a good flow. However, the longer I think about the session the more negative comes back to mind.

This became a favorite very quickly. I love cards that do multiple things and this offers an insane amount of choice for each card. It's perfectly in the middle for weight. Something to get out if I don't want to commit to something very big, but I want something to tax my brain as well.

RATING: 9
Probably my favourite Feld and I am a Feld fan. This game is tactics rather than strategy. It is about using your hand of 5 cards to best effect each round and you have to be aware of what the other players are doing. There are three elements that give you bonus points if you have the majority even if it is just once in the game and even if you later lose it. Making a big play to get a majority early on and then letting it go can work well. Also staying ahead on something throughout the game so noone else can get the majority can be fun too. 

I love how threats balance against wealth ("I want to use this blue card to get 6 money (because the blue dice is on 6) but maybe I should use it to get rid of the blue threat I just took because the blue dice is on 6.")

16 plays in and not bored yet.

Only played once so far but I liked it quite a lot. This is the game that Macao should have been. Feld games are always hit-or-miss and this one is a solid hit.

Update: After more plays, it's still a winner. There's a fairly large luck of the draw element with the cards. Even though you draw from two piles, sometimes you just can't get the color you need. And sometimes you have cards that only combo with certain other cards, but you don't get the right cards to make it work. Other than that, the game is just great. The expansion makes it even better by enhancing the formerly weak canal-building action and adding a couple of fun new elements.

A few years later, and I'm bumping this modern classic from a 9 to a 10. Once you're familiar with it, it plays in an hour or less (depending on the number of players), and I think the card mechanics and moderate level of player interaction provide something unique from the the rest of my Euro-style games. I understand and am empathic toward players who dislike the luck involved with the cards and dice rolls, but I think that's what seals it for me: Bruges is much more tactical than strategic, but paying attention to other players' actions, responding as best you can, and saving the right cards for later can help you gain an edge. I'm never disappointed with a round of this game, and almost always want to play if suggested. I feel that this is every bit as good as everyone's other favorite Feld, The Castles of Burgundy, but so completely different from it as to be a category unto itself.

Because of that it definitely has staying power and I like that it's not an overwhelming point salad, you generally break 50, but you're not looping around the board like the Indy 500.

Feld dose a card game, and it's great.
Every hand is a puzzle and you're trying to figure out how to best utilize it.
Multiple paths to victory that all seem balanced.

A fairly bit of luck involved, but the game is fast and offers plenty of delicious choices.

The disasters, random cards, and dice rolling make this a tense experience.

Like most Felds it plays really well with 2.

First Impression:

An enjoyable euro.

As with most excellent euro designs this game flows well and has some pretty deep and tough choices. There is also subtle but significant interaction with event manipulation, interesting rewards, and the canal antagonism. I also didn't mind the dice as much in this one (I usually hate them in euros) and the character cards were quite diverse and interesting, also raising the replayability of the game for quite a bit.

The theme is of course pasted here as well. Not to mention poorly defined and boring.

All in all this is a medium and very well designed euro. I'd play it any time gladly, despite it's "theme".

I like this game the more I play it. The variable card powers mixed with a bit of resource management(workers and money) work well. There are quite a few strategies that one can use.

When looking closely at the glut of Feld games to be released this year I thought this would be the one I didn't like. I kind of hoped for that. I even kind of forgot about it. Sabrina got a copy of it and Mike brought it to gaming. In fact it was quite an enjoyable game. I like that the game simply can not out stay it's welcome. Play 4 cards, draw 4 cards and game WILL end. I love tableau builders and it was obvious from Macao that Feld knows a thing or two in that category. The dice can be frustrating but the anticipation can be brilliant too. Now I want a copy of it.

RATING: 7
[thing=136888][/thing] is a light-ish game in which the cards are the heart and soul of the game - with them you do all the actions: build canals, to build buildings, use them to get rid of threats, or as persons (wich must be put in a building), to get money and to get workers. Every the players will use (at least) four cards, in one of the ways they work.

Once there are no more cards to be taken, it is the last round - the game is really short, around 1 hour, but with many things to consider in every turn. A clever game, as I expect from Feld - and, also, easy to learn, as none of us have problemas with rules, nor do we need to consult the manual during play (the way the cards work are described on them, and once we get used with the symbols and gameplay, is was a breeze).

There are dice, but they are used sort like they are in [thing=55670][/thing], as in: one roll for all of the dice, and they all will serve for all the players - the dice determin the amount of money the players will get (if the blue dice shows a 5, and you use a blue card to get money, you will get 5 money), how much cost to get influence (the sum of all the dice showing 1 and 2) and which threat markers the players will receive (when the dice shows a 5 or 6).

Though it isn't really a game with all that much interaction (the biggest part is in the majorities, where one can set the pace and blocks everyone else from gaining some nice points), in the plays I had we do had some actions that affected the others. For instance: in my first play, everyone went on different directions, using different combinations of persons. I went for canals, and suffered some setbacks due to persons of the others (one player use the Thief to steal money, other used the Arsenist to keep giving to the others red threat - fire - markers, and other used Vandals to destroy buildings of others), but still manage, in the end, to have some sort of engine working. In the end, a really close score: the winner had 45 points, I came in second, with 44, and the third place had 43 points! It was a great game.

The artwork, by Michael Menzel, is great.

So, for me, [thing=136888][/thing] is a solid light-ish game, with some deal of interaction (though not all that much, nor it will have issues with king-making, because the ill effects hits everyone, though, of course, someone may be more affected then others), in a play time of around 1 hour. I still prefer [thing=25554][/thing], for around the same length and weight, but [thing=136888][/thing] sure is a fine option.

RATING: 6
My initial concern about too many options at any moment (from watching rahdo's runthrough) is somewhat mitigated by the fact that you mostly won't be using cards' specially described abilities. To use such a card you first have to burn a different card to provide a house for it. And then you also burn cards to get money, workers, and canals, and to pay off threats.

It's aggravated though by the way that you play a single card on your turn. (Then after everyone has played four cards, that's the end of that round.) That makes it hard to solo play as you keep switching which player you are and it can be hard to keep a given player's strategy in mind. It's almost but not quite unnecessary that the game be structured this way, as most of what you do doesn't affect other players.

The point salad feel is stronger than I'd like. I think the problem is not just opacity (don't know what to try to do) but reduced tension (there always seems to be [i]something[/i] viable to do).

I don't mind the dice rolling since those results apply equally to everyone (see also: Macao). But as usual I don't care for the card drawing, into a personal hand, as this feels capricious and I worry about a feeling of low control.

The take-that abilities feel crude. Also, the seeming invitation to try to find game-winning card combos is unattractive.

Overall it's like a more random and much less thematic Pax Porfiriana.

...There's no focus to the competition with other players, such as the area control game or race game (shipping) in Macao. The disasters often lack bite (target something you don't have) and whether they hit you can come down to whether you draw the right color card. I don't know what's interesting here.

Medieval worker-placement game playing in the beautiful city of Bruges (called Brugge in Dutch), one our most beautiful cities in Flanders (the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium), that still has many historic monuments and buildings.

really quite enjoyed my one (long, painful) play of this.  POINTS SALAD, for sure, but an enjoyable one... though i did win, if that matters.  i loved the character-driven engine building side of the game and basically ignored the canals/esteem (or whatever it was) side of things - except for hurting others on those tracks.  but maybe i would have liked just an engine building game more?  not sure, but would be willing to play again FOR SURE, and its on my "thinking about it" list now, after only one play.

(PS - expect to not know anything in your first couple/3 turns.  don't even try, just jump in and try it out.  as a points salad game, i think just try out a couple things and feel out the system.  NOT a game to really try to win the first time.  yes, this nullifies my first win.)

Great medium weight Feld game.  1 card can do 6 things.

Dice dictate the price for influence points as well as when threats take place.

The luck of the draw can inhibit you some, and could be difficult to produce a strategy.

Had a good time playing this game two player. With more, it should more or less offer the same experience, as the number of cards available is adjusted to the number of players. The Michael Menzel board is gorgeous, even though I am a bit tired of his style of portraits (beautiful but over used as far as I am concerned). If you, like me, have a fondness for the lighter Feld games (Speicherstadt, Macao, Castles Of Burgundy, Amerigo), then Brugge is right up your alley. It is much lighter fare, and much more straightforward, than Trajan or Bora Bora. The game is almost purely tactical (as opposed to strategic), so it is really about making the most of what your are dealt. Its main selling point for me is the interesting way in which all the unique cards (and there are many of them!) work together. I am also confident that the number of cards in the game will ensure replayability. All in all, a very pleasant game, but probably not a must-have if you own Macao or Castles Of Burgundy: it is a little bit less exciting.

Another Feldian design with lots of special one time abilities that I quite enjoy. Special cards with unique abilities sometimes can be annoying when gaming with casual gamers who are not used to interpreting iconography. This makes the learning curve that much tougher and limits the gaming audience. However, underneath this typical Feldian design lies a fun game that feels more like a solo effort than a race for points. Money while tight, is not suffocating. There are ample ways of gaining resources either through card selection coupled with dice placement or playing varioud card combinations. Ultimately though, resources do need to be converted to points and there is where the competition exists in the form of building canals. Not sure why I like this one more. Perhaps unlike the other Feld designs where one has to fight tooth and nail for getting resources, this one just allows you to pick up the cards each hand for "free" and discard them for basic rewards.

Ugh, I did not enjoy this at all. The decision tree seemed to be very wide (LOTS of different options each turn) yet it seemed somehow very uninteresting for me. Lots of unique cards, but with very limited number of them you actually played during a single game. 

So: Mash of different things and mechanics, without a holistic feeling of a game. Not my cup of tea.

The drawings on the cards were beautiful though!

After all the hype, I was hoping to love this game but, after a couple of plays, I find that we're just friends. 
Too random, too much AP (as you analyze your card options after drawing), and too much dependence on learning the uses of all 160-odd cards: keeping track of your opponent's tableaux is as important as knowing your own. Teeny-tiny-eye-straino-vision writing means if you want to know how your opponent's character cards can affect the game, you'll have to get up, walk around the table, and peer over their shoulder. Is too many cards a bad thing?
It's also remarkably difficult to plan long-term strategy. Short term knee-jerk tactics? Sure. But when you're only (usually) keeping 1 card between hands, every turn is spent reacting to your re-draw rather than putting a points engine in place. I wonder how different the game would feel with a play one / draw one structure? The first player marker would be static, with a dice re-roll every 4 rounds. "Extra play" abilities would be activated in a special round just prior to the dice roll...
All this aside, Bruges is a fun, light game with fantastic art that will never play the same twice. But I'm also glad it's a fairly short one.

Feld's card placement, tableau building with some pretty funny randomization through dice rolls.  Amazing games with fine art work and graphic design. 

+The Bruges: The City on the Zwin expansion 'boats' really make this game complete and balanced. Add a +.5 to my rating.

excellent game. I love everything about it! 
The dice dictate how much money a certain colour is worth for the corresponding round. Each card has multiple functions, you can use it to collect money (according to the die), to build "canals", build a house, get the card in a house (which activates its effect (every card has an effect) or you can use it to discard a certain "danger marker" (if you have three of them, the danger affects you (you lose mones, points, people etc.)
The gameplay is perfect and the downtime very low, even with more players.
The expansion for the 5th player and the pets are very very good too.
One of my favourite games.

Too much luck in this game. Luck in drawing the right color of cards, luck in getting the kind of people you're going for, luck with the dice. Not a bad game, but I prefer London as a card-based tablaeu builder, so I got rid of it.

Lots of different parts very poorly integrated.  It felt like the board play was tacked onto the cards.

I liked the take that element in the game but still felt like some more interaction would have been nice.

It was interesting trying to get some card engines and combos happening but many other games do this better.

I could maybe be convinced to play this a few more times to explore more of the cards but I'd really rather be playing other games.

From a hand of 5, play 4 cards each turn.  Refresh.

Certain actions can be performed by every card, such as construct a house, collect workers (expended to construct houses), collect money, construct a canal segment on the board (requires money), etc.  But the focus of the cards is the personality portrait that provides a special power when placed into a constructed house.

The deck is 165 cards (perhaps around 100 drawn by game end). 165 cards, 165 different portraits, 165 different special powers:

[b]a)[/b] I am unwilling to invest time learning that much range of powers available

[b]b)[/b] I am unintersted in a game where every card thus played means yet further disparity in the rules by which each player is playing, with no two people ever playing the same game.

Think this is the first Feld game that has been a hit for me.  I enjoyed it quite a bit, really easy to pick up and learn, fast moving, lots of difficult decisions to make as any card can be used for multiple things.  I like that there's a little bit of randomness and unknown through the die roll each turn and the cards you pull.  With that randomness comes the same problem that most card-based games have, that sometimes luck of the draw can be too unfavorable and create frustration.

Update: After the first 10 plays, the game has been slowly dropping off.  Not much desire to revisit it.

point salad. multi use cards.
each round colored dice a rolled, which determine the value of the matching colored cards in that round (ala llorenzo)
high dice = more money, 5-6 means get threat.. need to discard card of matching color to get rid of threat, also play card to  get tableau

Im not very good at this game, i've been crushed every time i've played.  but it's fun.  it's lighter than some felds, but still has a lot going on. i love the way you can prepare for, and easily mitigate the negative events in the game (if you choose to).  of course, there's an opportunity cost to doing so, so you have to decide how far you want to push your luck.. good stuff.

Despite the popularity of the game, I must say this is one of Feld's game that disappoints me. Yes, it has unique and innovative card mechanics but the luck of the draw is killing me. It's okay I guess, considering the game time and weight is not as hard as Trajan or Bora-Bora or Amerigo. That's the reason it's still okay.

RATING: 6
Slightly above average Euro with some uniquely interesting mechanics.   I really love the creeping doom of the threat tokens and the way Bruges uses dice drafting.  I just wish the activities were more interesting.  Canal building?  It's just point-grabbing.  Building tons of the same house?  More points... The color doesn't even matter.  The politics track?  Yet another points race.  It's stuff like this that holds Bruges back.  While I'm usually willing to play Bruges, I'd much rather play Feld's Bora Bora, Castles of Burgundy, or Trajan.

PERMANENT PLACE IN COLLECTION after 5 plays.

UPDATE: After 5 plays with two players, upgraded score from 7 to 8.5. It's a keeper. My initial plays were very negative because I thought it was a strategic game and I kept getting colour-screwed. Later I realised it's a tactical game of risk management and opportunity.

Based on one play. One of the better Felds, although not nearly as interesting as Castles of Burgundy. This one has some tension and the cards are kinda interesting. Would be nice if you could expect cards of the same type...

I hadn't played Bruges before, which is a game based around earning prestige within the great merchant port of the same name, and you can do this in a number of different ways. There is even some conspiracy thrown into the mix with the character cards you may acquire as allies. Enjoyed it loads.

I've played this game over 20 times.  It's a fun light to medium strategy game.  It's more of a card game than a board game because almost all your actions are card based. I tend to enjoy the mechanics of card being multipurpose.  Adding in the expansion can make it a bit more cut throat because you can take down other people's buildings and cards.

Base game: 7/10. Feels a bit incomplete as a game because the 3s and 4s don't do anything and you can only move on the reputation track once per round, etc.

With expansion modules: 9/10. Feels more like a complete game when 3s and 4s bring ships on the board, and then building a canal gives you an option to use the powerful ship actions like moving on the reputation track for free, playing cards straight from the deck, etc.

Love this game, don't play it often enough. Family keen to play but game group always seems to have something they want to play more. 
Always a delicious / frustrating experience when you have 6 really good characters but you have to use 4 or 5 of them to get cash, houses, canals etc.
I think this one will have a lot of replay value because of the combinations and random cards, dice etc. the game is all about dealing with chance and mitigating luck / capitalising on fortune.

it's beautifully illustrated and quite rich.
the mechanics themselves are not incredibly original but there's something good about how you have to use the same cards to do very different things. surely there are several strategies you can follow.
i appreciate quite a lot the "be the first in this aspect some time during the game and you'll make these points"

unfortunately, it's a combo game after all, therefore not my favourite kind of game

After my second game (4 players this time) i raised the rating some 0.5 points. It plays well, good rhytm, different paths to victory, we were all in a very few points at the end althought everyone focused on something different. I'll play it again gladly

In this wealthy city in Belgium we are merchants trying to maintain our power and influence.  A beautiful game board depicting a city surrounding what appears to be a football field for prestige scoring. Along the outside perimeter of the city we need to dig a canal. Prosperity is threatened by fire, revolt, flood, intrigue, and plague. A 5-colored theme pervades the threat dice, multi-use cards, workers and areas of the city. Scoring for majority each round gives urgency to the game. Random card selection forces a diversified strategy.

One of Feld's lighter contributions where you basically need to think on your feet. There is little to work with in long-term planning. It's all about collecting the most points, and trying to make the most of your draws to achieve that end.

It is not deep, but it does engage for the moment...indeed, it definitely plays out hand-to hand. There are a few Feldian ideas here, dice-determiners, and having to make the best of an immediate situation, but there is a subtle form of planning involved. 

This is basically a card game, each card having several options for use. You can always see the 'next' card color, but not it's abilities. You can prepare for situations that will give you better options with the cards you draw. So in that respect, it is not entirely 'luck of the draw'. Luck is just more apparent, but it does not navigate the game, it only looks like it does.

This is an easy game to teach, and it does play well with two, which is primarily how I play.

I guess we’re true Feld-adepts. So far this year there are three new games published which are develloped by Stefan Feld. In the meantime we own, and played, all three of them. Bruges was the last one in the row. We expected that this would be a less interesting game than Rialto should be. As Rialto was a little bit disappointing, the expectations on Bruges were pretty low. Then we read a review which was quite possitive. The reviewer said it was even better then Bora Bora was, and if you wanted to buy one of the three new Feld games, this should be the one. We started to get very curious on the game, and M. started to read the German rules. I found an English translation of the rules, and I started to read those. After reading them, we believed this was a pretty easy game. And in fact, it isn’t that hard. It could be explained in 10 to 15 minutes, as there are just a couple of things to explain. Each round consists of 5 phases.


    Fill your hands up to 5 cards. There are two stacks of cards. Backside up. The cards have different colors, front and back. You have to choose which color will be the most usefull, and pick that card. You may not look at the front of the card until you have 5 cards in your hand.
    Roll the 5 dice. After rolling the dice, sort them on value from low to high, and place them on the square on the gameboard. Then distribute the threat markers for each die that shows a 5 or a 6, in the color of the die. At the moment a player receives the 3rd threat marker in a single color, the corresponding threat occurs immediately for that player. After the threat markers are distributed and the threats have occurred, the players may choose to advance 1 step on the prestige track. The costs to advance are determined by adding up all the pips of the dice that shows a 1 or a 2. This is the only time during a turn, a player can advance on the prestige track. If none of the dice show a 1 or a 2, then the players can’t advance in that round.
    Play cards and take actions.
    – Players start this phase with 5 cards in hand.
    – The players take turns playing 1 card from their hand, and select from 1 of the 6 possible actions.
    – This goes on in turns, until each player has played 4 cards from his hand, and executed the 4 corresponding actions.
    The possible actions are:
    a. Take 2 workers (corresponding to the color of the card)
    b. Take 1-6 florins (corresponding to the value of the die that correspond to the color of the card)
    c. Put back 1 threat marker (in the color of the card)
    d. Build 1 canal tile (if possible. The tile that is going to be build must match the color of the card.
    e. Build 1 house (pay with a worker corresponding to the color of the card)
    f. Place 1 person
    Determine the 3 majorities. When a player has a majority, he flips over the corresponding tile over to the colored side, and earns 4 points for that tile at the end of the game.

The major part of the game, is in playing the cards. And this is were the games become interesting. Each card shows a person which has unique possibilities, but you can’t use all of them because you’ll also need the other 5 possible actions. Then you’ll have to sacrifice that person, just because you need that red card to build the red canal tile or a blue card to collect some hard needed money, because the blue die is showing 6.  And the bad thing about all this, you know when you sacrifice a person, you won’t get them back in your hands, because all of the 165 cards in the game have unique persons on them.

After playing all we could say was: “WOW! This is a great game.” The, earlier mentioned, reviewer, could even be right, and, of the three Feld games that are published this year, this is the one to get. I say could be right, because there is quite a lot of luck in this game. There is luck in drawing cards, there is luck in rolling dice. But the luck is manageable, and that is what it makes a great game. But to say that it’s better then Bora Bora? That depends on the group which you’re playing. If you’re playing with a group that is slightly advanced in playing boardgames, this is the game to get. If you’re playing with experienced players, get Bora Bora, and if you’re playing with families or non-experienced players, just pick up Rialto. We’re lucky that we could have pick up all three of them, and don’t have to choose, but if we had to, it would be a hard choice between Bora Bora and Bruges. The players in us would pick the first one, but we know that we’ll play Bruges more often, just because it’s a bit lighter.

This game always leaves me wanting more. That, to me, is the hallmark of an excellent game. I love the card interaction and the excitement that comes with trying to draw a card to complete a combo. It plays quickly, smoothly, and I love the art. Winner!

EDIT: After repeated plays, I'm reducing the rating. I've found that all the criticisms are valid: too much randomness, too dependent on the luck-of-the-draw, card game masquerading as a board game. When the draw goes your way, the game is fantastic and a 9 as I wrote above. But when it doesn't it makes for a frustrating game lacking any interesting decision-making.

Reminds me of Macao, another very good Feld title.  They both have a large library of "people" cards with activated/CIP/end-game-scoring abilities and poor, occasionally-confusing templating.  They both use dice in a smart, non-annoying way.  

But between Macao's cool wind rose mechanic and the fact that Bruges plays in half the time that Macao does, they don't feel redundant.

Works fine in general, but it's unbalanced and for a thinking game, there are too catastrophic events.
Examples: get 2 workers from each other player (early in the game); destroy a house (late in the game); get 2 victory points per people category and the joker that counts for 3 categories.

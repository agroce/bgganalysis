Among the Stars REVIVAL is a pure butter 2player game. Among the Stars has tried THREE times to make a good two player variant to the main game and finally succeeded on the fourth attempt. This game is easily in my top favorites. It brings all the good old charms of Among the Stars like:

• Card quality is moderate to decent quality. I would still personally sleeve the cards just to get a better tactile feel. Chit quality is A+, as are the rest of the components. Great job here.

• The game is very nicely balanced and provides the exact experience you would expect from being told about it.

• Building a station is just plain fun. Having to be mindful of where you put things in relation to others, still trying to get that "space station" feel, and seeing something you invested time and money into grow makes you feel like a true entrepreneur.

• This game lends itself to narrative moments and emergent gameplay. Often, the calculated perfect way to build your station is also what your gut tells you due to narrative weight. Don't put gardens near guns... And it's fun to come up with Babylon-5esque stories afterward. This would probably make a great Space Station RP tool.

• Scoring makes sense and wastes nothing. I get tired of games that ignore actions which lead you to money or using precious resources. Not here. You get VP for power stations that are fully used to capacity, credits you prudently didn't spend, and other such things. Good job here.

Plus ULTRA:

• You can now take these rules and apply them to any 2P versions of Among the Stars you want! Including all the expansions.

• Uses OPEN DRAFT. Which I find in my very long experience to be heavily more skill-based than dark draft or pack draft. Yet at the same time, is comforting to see all the possibilities laid out for the picking.

• Is a full game despite ALSO being an expansion. It brings some interesting ambassador components to the main game.

I would say if there's one other nitpick I could have toward the game, it would be a named and tiered set of titles you get based on your points. Roll Player does this with the ending VP and helps players understand how well they did overall, not just comparative to their opponents.

This game will probably remain as one of my very favorites for a long long time. Go buy this because it turns the entire Among the Stars series into an easy 9 from me.

A more of the same type of expansion that can also be treated as a stand alone game. Not a big fan of the 2-player rules implemented in here. The variant from the base game of drafting works much better. Some of the new concepts and mechanics, however, are interesting and make this worth picking up to mix in with an existing set.

Really enjoyed our first play through of this. The card drafting and placement mechanics really make for interesting choices, though can cause AP. I feel like the AP problem will lessen with more plays however, as it's mostly due to not knowing the cards and their interactions. Enjoyed how the active player switched between rounds, so who had first pick of cards switched with each in game year. I also liked that you only use a some of the included cards when you play, which will make every game different and take us a while to see all the cards. We didn't use the added 'Advisors' module, so will update when we've played with it! All in all, very good, would really recommend!

I really enjoy Among the Stars, it offers a unique and refreshing take on tile laying games. My one complaint was that it wasn't great with two players... In comes Among the Stars: Revival to solve the problem. This game works really well with two players and can be used as an expansion for Among the Stars, which is an added bonus in my book.

RATING: 7.5
Have yet to play it, but I unpacked, read the rules and the new cards. It looks very solid. Compared to the base game with x expansions and promo cards, ambassadors etc. and can see this as a very good introduction to the game. The advisor and spaceships mechanisms seem cool – and the new "open drafting" as a viable variant too.

I like Among the Stars, but the 2-player drafting in this version just fell flat.  I might have liked it more had I never played 7 Wonders Duel.  But I have, and that game handles the draft in an excellent, engaging manner. I am happy I have the new cards for regular AtS from this set, though.

RATING: 5
(Rating for 6-player expansion only, never playing this with 2-3.)

Honestly, I would much rather have 2 base sets (which would work, by the way) compared to what this has to offer. Spaceships are reminiscent of black pearls in the Abyss expansion, but are not implemented nearly as well. Getting rid of them takes time and effort you could be spending getting ahead, and winning with them requires *very* specific draws, so they just end up being annoying. Other cards have conditions that are confusing as heck. Could have also added more races/objectives. Would avoid.

Érdekes koncepció, hogy kiegészítő is, meg kétfős különálló változat is. A nyílt lapos kártyavivés a kétfős változatban nem rossz, de elég más érzetet ad a játéknak, mert így nagyon kiszámolható lesz, hogy ha én ezt elviszem, a másik mit visz, és vajon jobban megéri-e neki keresztbe tenni, mint olyat vinni, ami nekem jó. Vigyázni kell, mert nagyon elnyúlhat a játék, ha minden esetben ezt így végigszámolja az ember.

Az új hajós/kikötős elem is érdekes, azt hittem nem fog tetszeni, mert blokkolja az ellenfél építkezéseit, de ugyanakkor meg számos lap kimondottan jutalmazza azt a játékost, akinek sok hajója van az űrállomásán, szóval remek lehetőségeket hoz a játékba.

A tanácsadókért folytatott "harc" talán kicsit esetleges. Lehet, hogy néha megéri csak azért olyan típusú épületet építeni, hogy az én oldalamra kerüljön a jelző, de nehéz vele számolni. Ettől függetlenül jó ötlet, működik is, csak nem éreztem olyan nagy hatását a játékra, mint ahogy azt előre gondoltam.

As a stand-alone game, this is a fine 2p adaptation, but probably not the ideal way to play Among the Stars. As an expansion, this is worth it for the added cards. I like the new mechanic of docking ships on opponents' stations to prevent them from building there. It gives the game some much-needed interaction.

2p only or expansion to basic Among the Stars. I like the fact that it is 2p only. There is a nice drafting mechanic in this game designed for the 2p. Works basically the same way as general Among the Stars, if you know it. If not you are just building a tableau of location cards and stations trying to get as many points as possible, some in game and some end of game. This game also offers characters that you are trying to gain influence and victory points from. They give bonuses at the end of each round too. That is a nice change up and gives some focus. I have to say I very much enjoyed this game. Seeing that I never get Among the Stars played, I don't think I will be purchasing this game though. I would be happy to play it again.

I consider this to be purely an expansion for Among the Stars as the new two-player rules are a step down over the previous variant. It adds some new basic and special locations which are good, and also a couple of new modules with ships and advisers. Ships are a blocking mechanism used to take up space in your station, but there are some scoring opportunities for them as well. Advisers are basically a small tug-of-war game where building certain location types and taking certain actions will net you points and a special ability at the end of each round. I think it is a strong addition to the base game and it integrates well despite a bit of tinkering that needs to be done if you want to use specific parts of the expansion with the regular game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a standalone 2-player version of Among the Stars.  It pretty much plays exactly the same as Among the Stars, players alternate drafting a card (only this time from a central pool of face-up cards instead of passing hands) and either build that location, a power plant, or draw cards.  Everything else is pretty much exactly the same.

This also acts as an expansion to Among the Stars and all the new locations can be added into the base game which is really the main reason I got it.  Plus the Kickstarter came with some really neat power reactor figures (and some REALLY crappy spaceship tokens).

I don't usually comment on expansions but there are a couple of things about this one that need a reminder. In no particular order; 1) I'm a sucker for miniatures 2) I like the ships element in strategy and as interactive obstacles 3) I like the added interactive strategy dimension of winning favor of the neighboring galactic races, 4) The designers are getting very clever with the build goals of the space station tiles, 5) I like that there is many options and strategy decisions for trashing tiles, 6) I really dig the community tile draw almost better than the draft of the base game.

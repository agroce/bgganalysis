GAME: Proud Monster: The Barbarossa Campaign
RANK: 4197
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Own about 10 Command games and this is probably the best. The Soviets can't adopt a sensible cut and run strategy as victory is linked to holding certain objectives for a certain length of time.Soviet units start with their strngths inverted so the Germans have no idea how much force to apply in each area. Mechanics clean and simple witha  miinimum of chrome. The remake (which I haven't got) seems flawed if the chat online is correct. Its dropped the price of this however online so pick up a copy. Have also got the companion game "death and destruction" which extends things to the end of '44 but haven't played yet due to space issues at the moment.

Awesome; the time-pressure really adds to this system. Am I able to reach the amount of needed VP or do I have enough momentum to go on. 
I use this game even with newbies in the hobby - basic system, easy to explain.

Old style hex and counters wargame on operation Barbarossa. The big plus in this game is that PM is a monster, but can be completed in a single day.Rules are easy to learn, playing is fun. I reccomend the team play. With 4 people this game is a blast and is even faster.

OK, why if I love Ty Bomba games so much did this get a 6 only?  

It is a monster, and it is Ty Bomba, which means playable.  However, I just don't think the monster status helps the game so much.  It slows it down.

I really like Blitz 41 a lot better.  It covers the same period, and is faster and more exciting.  You can play it many times for one proud monster.  Nothing wrong wtih proud monster, but a game with little chrome as a monster just isn't my cup of tea.  Now, Blitz 41 ....

Decent enough, but a beast. The varying VCs are the clever aspect of the design, forcing the Red Army to fight the Axis with at least some of their forces rather than running away to hold out in front of the traditional victory cities (Moscow, Leningrad, Rostov).

RATING: 10
The original Command edition, not the significantly different Proud Monster Deluxe, which won't even fit on a 3 by 6 foot table.

One of the few wargames I would grab from a burning house, along with Paths of Glory and EastFront.  Really just what wargaming is all about.  Move, attack, defend, never stop to check the rulebook.

Command #27 - mint

At division level this game really gives you a sense of the scale of the eastern front.  A lot of fun.  Not too complex from a rules statement, especially if you have played any other Ty Bomba east front games.  The sudden death victory conditions keep the game tense.  I am looking forward to Proud Monster Deluxe from Compass Games.

Interesting mechanic of the game potentially ending every turn (the number of objectives the Axis player requires to win changes turn by turn) so the tension is there right from the start.  The unknown combat value of untried Soviet troops is also an interesting feature (though we have tended to still calculate pre-battle odds based on the mean value for that troop type).  The Soviet player has to be very very careful not to lose the game pretty early on.  If the Soviet player can thicken their line to 5 counter high stacks east of the German Attenuated Supply (GAS) with a second line of defence then they are well on the way to victory.  The game is fairly unforgiving which is a downside given its lengthy set-up time, playing time and learning curve.

RATING: 7
A very different design approach than most other "big game" treatments of OPERATION BARBAROSSA--emphasis is on playability and speed in getting through the turns.  Purists may object to cherished design "imperatives" getting thrown out (e.g., there are no rail lines in the game); "design for effect" is generously spread around and it works--and works well.  This was perhaps the best magazine game that XTR's COMMAND magazine published in its day.  

The sequel game, DEATH AND DESTRUCTION was much less successful.

Proud Monster gives you the freedom to explore the campaign's many possibilities within an accessible system. You may wonder then why I have this game for trade. Simply put, it is too big and for a game has to actually have a shot at being played. Furthermore, the history has some holes and the brigade units are more of a hassle than a benefit. For all the poor reviews Land Without End: The Barbarossa Campaign received, it seems the second edition fixed things up. At any rate, I would prefer a game with fewer counters and only one map. Still, if you like the subject and you don't mind Bomba's lack of chrome, Proud Monster is worth the effort.

I've been playing a few games recently... Interesting mechanics with soviet scattered placement and fow but we actually haven't found a way for soviets to last more than 2 turns.
I believe that from the 3rd turn onwards balance will heavily shift to sovit side. We'll go on trying... :)

An awesome monster-game covering the Russian Front in 1941. Fast-moving, relatively simple mechanics make this a real winner! The usual XTR copy/paste style to designing wargames is evident here, but it works brilliantly! I'm not usually into either Russian Front games, nor in many monster games, but I liked this so much I went and got the mega-expansion Death & Destruction recently, although I have yet to play that. 

Actually played this game this year, and found as big as it is, it can actually be played in a not too-unreasonable amount of time! (took me about 5 days with about 2-4 hours of play per day during my last vacation) Still love it after all these years!

A fast playing monster.  The clean rules allows one to start into the game right away.  The game play does a great job of capturing the feel of the 1941 campaign.  One of the great mechanics is the untried units rule for Soviet units.  It creates a great tension as odds can't be calculated with any certainty. I would also argue that this speeds up play since no one is scouring the map for that last factor.  The components are very nice, particularly the counters.

Simple rules let you play against your opponent and not the rulebook. No ZOCs was a surprise at first, I remember scouring the rulebook for at least a line stating "yes, there are no ZOCs in this game." No such luck so I had to accept that there really were none. The lack of them works well if not even better at this scale encouraging the players to move fast and take risks.

The escalating sudden death victory points each turn are a great idea. Each turn the Germans need more points awarded by taking cities or large towns to win. If they do great they can win on turn 1! 
The Germans must push fast and not forget what objectives to meet rather than just destroying all of the enemy units. The Russians have to pick just the right moment to withdraw rather than always holding a city to the death. This use of points keeps the Russians form just running east from the start like most sane players with hindsight do in Barbarossa campaign games.

Tension builds as quite often the Germans fail to win on a turn by a single point only to have the next turns victory condition grow by another 5 points. The race in on :-)

The height of Ty Bomba's "Third Reich" in the wargaming world (the first two is SPI and AH).  Obsessive let-me-do-this-again-in-my-way on the Germans lightning warfare against Soviet Russians.  Heavy counter card stock and several maps for a magazine game.  There are many "firsts" done and breakthroughs by this game.  Simply put, you just can't resist to have this game.

Very very good if you have a few days to kill. Played 3 times as Russia, losing (but later) each time. Best idea was to treat it as a giant PANZERGRUPPE GUDERIAN/RUSSIAN CAMPAIGN and think in terms of (expendible)armies ie 20+ divisional chunks rather than stacks. The panzers can go wherever they want, but have limited sensible choices. Put your defences there to slow and grind them down.Your armies will die isolated left somewhere pointless in any case.

Incredible game, Ive worn my copy out and want to order the mag and game again to get a second copy before it goes out of print forever!

Very playable and the mechanics lend it to recreating the situation as it happened in 41. panzers are strong fast, but there importance makes them fragile (every lost step hurts, down time waiting for them to refit hurts even more) wermacht Infantry are always playing catchup in the early days. OOB is fairly detailed, though with the russians untried status is a bit weird, but just that alone can throw in some alternate reality situations (you may stand strong in areas that historically didnt)

Playing the soviets is HARD, it took me reading an article on how to hold fast and setup with the russians to realize how use them effectivley, but its definately do-able.

Actually, this game might not be a 10.  It has some issues.  Overall though I spent so much time playing it and figuring it out, and re-learning what the Eastern Front was all about, that it was one of the most worthwhile gaming experiences I've had.  I'd do it all again.  The game is slippery, and, imo, balanced...however, the game will usually end in a landslide one way or the other...giving the appearance that is what happens every time for that side.  In fact I think it is pretty close to 50/50, but if the Germans win the game is usually over in Aug/Sep.  The follow on game is very well done but the system creaks and groans under all those new units and years of war;  the replacement rates can get out of whack over 200+ turns.

Two map, 1000 counter, mini-monster (magazine!) game of the first six months of the Russian campaign in WWII. Standard (i.e. excellent) XTR components, and lots of 'em. Surprisingly playable, just difficulties of scale to deal with for the most part. The game follows the usual initial romp by the Germans into Russia, reaping the Soviets like so much wheat, until supply problems, weather, and the seemingly endless supply of Russian troops, drag them to a halt within sight of their objective - or maybe not, that's up to the players.

Easy to play and learn but a little unbalanced pro german , soviet player has to be perfect to avoid loss in the first three turns and  sometimes he can't if german commander is a little more than average.

If you a want wild west shoot-out kind of game, here's the blandest most vanilla approach you can imagine. Move or shoot with your faux minis until someone wins. It does play fast, which makes it better than more detailed approaches to the subject matter.

I'm an old Gunslinger hand, so this was a must. I ordered a copy from Leisure Games as soon as it became available in the UK. Initial impressions are very favourable. Nice components and a nice straightforward and very playable game. I'll still be hanging on to my copies of Gunslinger, but I'll probably be getting another copy of Cowboys to get two sets of the double-sided maps (as I did with Gunslinger).

This should get plenty of table time as its a simple but flavourful game to play of an evening to unwind at the end of a busy day.

Originally rated a 10, this slips down notch whist waiting for an expansion set.

The game is simplistic to the point of boring. The "you move, I move" design seems to be the main culprit. The production values are excellent and the scenarios are abundant and well done. The advance rules, however, have made this a much better game. I raised my rating from a 5 to a 7.

A very light gunfight simulation.  I found it to be a little to light for my tastes.  Limited options during games play left me a little bored.  I was really hoping for more!  Looks like I may have to try and find a copy of Gunslinger that wont cost me an arm and a leg ;)

This is a shame.  The genre is ripe for a good tactical game.  But here the implementation was far too clunky.  Vague rules don't help and strange choices made in development leave me baffled.

Fast and Furious.  Hits the "GunSlinger Lite" target dead on.  High quality components, easy rules, you'll  be up and playing in 5 minutes. 

We added a simple iniative system to our first game (with children as young as 10 playing).  No problem.  same with "advanced" rules, not very advanced, easy to incorporate.  Add more house rules to suit yourself.

If you want a "simulation" with all kinds of extra complexity, play GunSlinger.  If you want beer & pretzals that you can even enjoy with the milk and cookies crowd, this is the game.

I'm not a fan of Westerns but I like this game.  The theme is used incredibly well, especially in the card draws, but the rules need some polish.  We had a three player gun fight that just wouldn't end.  If I was actually a fan of cowboys or the western genre, I'd probably rate this a whole point higher.

What a great game! And it gets better with each successive play. An enormous amount of fun, incredibly easy to learn & teach. Attractive components with an absolute minimum of setup time. And I have yet to play with someone who didn't love this. Case in point: A Eurogaming friend sat down to his first game (The Good, the Bad and the Not-So-Pretty scenario, 3 players) and was promptly killed ON THE FIRST TURN by ONE incredibly lucky shot (double sixes plus a Critical Hit card). His reaction when the scenario was over? "That was GREAT... let's play another one!" And so we did. Highly recommended. And since this has proven to be such a hit, Worthington's upcoming "Freebooters" is a foregone conclusion. UPDATE: Hmmm. I guess that upcoming title is "Pirates: Age of the Sword" now.

RATING: 7
I really enjoyed my first play of this.  I actually don't think there is anything I don't enjoy about this, except that we played with 8 players and it really feels like there are two players.  I really would like to play this where the teams can't really discuss among themselves what they are doing... it is a fast pace shootout.  Maybe if you are in the same building you can converse.  Anyway, can't wait to give it another go.

I like this game a lot.  The artwork fits very well, and game play is straight forward.  The theme works well, and keeps players engaged.  Needing an alternate rule for move and shoot is the only flaw I see.
Played again with move and shoot rule (-1 to hit for each space moved that turn).  Loved it.  That optional rule fixed every complain I had about the game.

RATING: 6
A miniatures skirmish game, themed on the old West.  Players take a move or a shoot action with a stand up cardboard cowboy piece.  Movement is simply counting "one, two, three, four", and shooting is rolling two dice for hits.  That's about it!  Very simplistic disposable fluff.  However, add in the set of official "advanced rules" and we begin to get somewhere - the ability to move and shoot in the same action, variable activation order, variable damage and "overwatch" fire help the game immensely.

The game this most reminds me of is Star Wars Miniatures, although here there is no character differentiation (other than +0,+1,+2 modifiers).   There are a number of scenarios, which is a plus, but the core rules are almost too simple.  Still, it's very fast to play and the theme is rich.

Light "miniatures" (OK, cardboard cutouts) combat with a cowboy theme. It seems to quickly devolve into a slugfest, where you just stand up and take shots at one another until somebody wins.

This game has excellent components and a simple, easy design. A bit too simple, however. Each cowboy has four health points and loses one each time he's hit. That's a little nutty. Not many people in gun fights got hit four times for obvious reasons. Why not increase the health points to five and have the players roll for health points after each hit? Also in a scenario the first side to take it's turn can have everybody shoot twice before the other side does a thing. That's way too much of an advantage. Why not have each side roll (with modifiers for the better gunmen) to see who goes first, and then have the shooters fire individually. The scenarios are a plus but a lot of famous gunfights have been left off: Hickok versus Phil Coe, Luke Short versus Jim Courtright, Bat Masterson versus Sgt. King, etc.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Not a terrible game at all.  A little dry, a little slow, a little overly mechanical, but from a time when people were more willing to inject their own fun into a game like this, instead of being force-fed a steady diet of plastic minis that stand in for actual fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
I was hoping for Gunslinger-lite, but it's lighter than that.  As written, the rules are simple and the game plays somewhat awkwardly, with each team using all of their characters at once (with no chance for opportunity fire).  Advanced rules fix those issues, but the game still didn't quite do it for me.  Great components, though!  Especially the maps.

This is like Gunslinger light. Pretty easy to play. Even with the advanced rules which I highly recomommned to make the game better and more fun. It really shines with more players. As playing with 2 or 3 can be kind of bland. I enjoyed this game for it's simpleness. Though I do wish that it was a little meatier.

The game plays fairly quick and the components are well made. Though, I would of liked to have seen plastic minatures. Rather than the cardboard stand-ups that come with the game.

This is NOT anything like Squad Leader with cowboys as the designers have said. Too simplistic, definately needs more advanced rules.  The first 5 scenarios are basically a roll-off, I understand the "realism" logic, I just think that it makes for a boring game, this is a game not a simulation. I would like to see a damage deck and more phasing. the components are nice except that a lot of the art on the "stand ups" is covered up by the stands.  I think that this is almost there, I am going to wait for an expansion before I decide to keep it or purge it. It seems like most people have house rules for this, hmmm...

RATING: 6
Quite a simple (boring) game unless you play with the "Advanced Rules" that are on the publishers web site.  Many scenarios are historical situations but not balanced at all.  Even the advanced rules are simple and fast playing.  Believe it or not you can pick up a weapon from the ground while on horseback.

Great components that can be used for other games.  Why did the produce three versions of the same gunfighter with 0,+1,+2 in the corner instead of supplying more variety?

[Initial Impression: 4] Just not a game that flips me. Run around, pick up items, and shoot your opponents until only one team is left standing (sort of Duel of Ages in the Wild West with simpler dice resolution). The fact that your movement and health are both reduced by hits means that when you're wounded it becomes even more difficult to escape (although I suppose this leads to a mercifully quick end - we invited those eliminated to control the townspeople, but this didn't seem to compensate for being out of the game early). I will admit that it can be an amusing romp, especially when your opponents are caught in your teammates' crossfire.

Give it a 10 because I'm excited about PLAYING it! Great Job creating a Fun, Playable game! Will use this game to play w/teenage gamers, and w/friends for a quick dual. I think the designer's response to the move/shoot option covers the subject well. I will use ALL of the optional rules, especially Fan Fire  and modified critical hits.
More stuff:
Avoiding I Go--You Go:

What about dealing 6 cards to each player and letting them play 1 card at a time for 5 impulses, high card goes first. In case of a tie, play a second card, and get 2 actions in a row automatically---adds strategy and card play and excitement. With the extra 6th card added to your side for use in play-adds yet another interesting decision, and gets more cards involved in the play. For solitaire, just flip the cards randomly to see who goes 1st.

I also think that step and fire (w/penalty is a good idea) as long as the cowboy is exposed to potential return fire... using the card play initiative option, a player would want to hold some high cards before venturing out into the open....
Someone asked for running, but a move rate of 4 IS running, using less is walking (men running = horse movement 4). Make sure to use the optional rule for facing and you see the advantage of walking.

RATING: 7
Tentative Rating-likely to bump up after I get a chance to play a few more of the "meatier" scenarios.  Current rating based on 1 play session where we played scenario 1 and scenario 3.  The first scenario is a 1 on 1 gunfight that plays in less than ten minutes and doesn't amount to much.  I'd really recommend it as a quick learning scenario to introduce the rules and not much else.  Scenario #3 is the gunfight at the O.K. Corral -With four cowboys per side and more card play it was a LOT more enjoyable, and I can't wait to tear into the rest of the 20-plus scenarios.  (Several of which have asymetrical forces and winning conditions)

The components are of excellent quality.  You can tell Worthington had this one printed and assembled in Germany.  The counters are of typical Euro thickness and are stamped so well they basically just fall out of the sheets.  The six doubled sided boards are mounted and have nice art with functional black and red lines overlaid for game purposes.     

UPDATE: The larger scenarios are MUCH better than the simplistic showdowns. Bumped up a point after 4 games.

Hmmm, not highly rated but it's partly due to the NUMEROUS holes in the rules. I REALLY hate the move or shoot option, you should be able to somehow move AND shoot. It stagnates the game to the point that no one can move within close range without getting destroyed before ever having a chance to shoot.  House rules are definitely needed for this game, I have little doubt anymore.

A fun, simple game with good components and attractive theme. This game has been much maligned, but it's also much improved by adding in the advanced rules available from the publisher.

My rating might go up with expansions and rule tweaks. A problem I find is that many scenarios have one side trying to get a number of cowboys off the board. A neat idea but once you take a shot or two you are crawling across the board, you'll never make it. So it usually just turns into a shoot em up. That's not a bad thing as that is what the box advertises. The advanced rules are a must {except the variable damage, a matter of taste, I realize that a real gun could kill someone with one shot i.e. an ace, I just prefer my guys to take the slower one life at a time}. If you don't use the advance rules it's a serious yawn fest. On the plus side it comes with 26 scenarios and double sided boards for many combinations. Not sorry I bought it but I was hoping for more.

This is a very light simulation of classic legendary western gunfighting. All the stuff you've seen and read in those dusty westerns, factual or not, can be quickly recreated here. There are plenty of scenarios to cover just about whatever you can think of and it seems easy enough to put together your own.

It's very easy to learn and get started shooting at one another. This is not a highly detailed simulation by any means but it'll get lead in the air pretty quickly.

Boy, is this game up my alley. Old west? Check. Light, dice rolling combat? Check. Cool components? Check. 

Now - it's by all rights just an ok game, but for *me*, it's an 8. If you dig stuff like Heroscape, Risk, Memoir 44, ie, light, dice chucking shoot 'em ups, you ouight to like this.

8: After several plays of various size scenarios and numbers of players, I think Cowboys is a really good game. It is a quick game that gets you moving and shooting. The cards add surprises and flavor. Like the best games always do, it leaves your game group with smiles and great stories to tell! "Remember that time you set the bank on fire and then got trapped in the alley with two cowboys at each end...!?"

RATING: 4
Had I never played Gunslinger, I might have given this a better score.  I certainly had fun in my one play, but it is a bit too simple for me to really score much higher.  Plus, the way the rules are set up allow for some very 'gamey' situations, like rushing past your opponent to try and set up a shot in the back the following turn: a bit silly.  I really did like the maps, and how they showed the square-sides in red where you had some cover: great idea.  I don't know why they did not use hexes, though:  very strange not being able to move in a diagonal.  Also, the weapons are pretty primitive (pistol, rifle, shotgun).  Finally, not being able to kill an opponent on a single shot is very weird: in fact, you are guaranteed to be able to take 2 shots, even up to 4 before expiring, which also leads to some odd situations.  For a light, quick gunfight, it works ok, but make sure you don't go into it too seriously.

Nice intro wargame: fun and quick. 

I'm starting to warm up to this game, especially since I've convinced my father to play it, who's not much of a gamer - but is a huge fan of westerns.  

The optional and advanced rules are a must (depending on the scenario), which is where this game is shaky.  Some rules just don't work with some scenarios (i.e. variable damage in scenario 10) and you have to play them and figure it out on your own.  This could be remedied with a new scenario book that incorporates the advanced rules appropriately.  

There's a high luck element but there's also a decent narrative told.  In the end this is a light skirmish game that's best with a few beers and lots of 1880's style swearing.  

Give me a refined, play-tested scenario book that incorporates all the advanced rules and this game is a 10.

I'm greatly looking forward to the new Apache game that was inspired by this.

First play was underwhelming - I was eliminated in the first fifteen minutes and while I was playing, the whole thing felt fairly straightforward - choices failed to feel meaningful.

If you are expecting a detailed tactical simulation - this isn't it.  Cowboys is a light-weight shooter that works well enough with beer or to roll dice with your kids.  The one thing that bothers me is that you can either shoot OR move.  I think the game would open up more if you can move (at a reduced rate) AND shoot once (with a -1 modifier).

I may adjust my '6' rating upwards a notch after I get more plays in using the advanced rules and meatier scenarios.

I played the Butch & Sundance scenario as the guy who starts without a gun.  I was simultaneously bored to tears and blinded with hate.  Half of my opponents never even made it onto the board, since the townspeople did their dirty work for them.

However, you'd have to lasso me with a barbed wire lariat to get me to play it again.

A really fun, simple game that is a nice change of pace from my normal brainburner games like ASL and Go.  Evokes the Old West theme wonderfully.  The game is almost TOO simple, but with the Advanced Rules and a more in-depth scenario, it can still be pretty involved.  Plusses: S***load of scenarios, good quality chits and boards, great theme.  Minuses: Simplistic, some awkward rules, NOT ENOUGH SCENARIOS!  

I really hope they make an expansion for this game.  My friend and I love it!

Pretty short and simple which may be a positive or a negative depending on who you ask. Playing out historic gun battles is fun.  It can support 10 players which is rare.  I actually wish the combat had some more complexity because the move OR shoot rules can lead to stalemates. I recommend a move-and-shoot-with-penalty house rule.

I initially had more enthusiasm for this game, with its attractive and stylish art and components (something most Worthington Games feature) but the game is just too simple to really offer any strategy.

Well, it is a Cowboy gunfighting game and I love the theme. Like most have said there are some issues with the game. Mostly it is just too simple for what it COULD be. Basically you either move OR shoot, which means someones has to just be aggressive. With that said, we did implement some house rules to spice up the game. One is we determine initiative every turn and two, allow the addition of more cards during the match.
Even though it's basic, it still has some fun to be had. Perfect for play with kids or a no brainier evenings.

Essentially a miniatures game set in the Old West.  The variety of scenarios looks pretty good.  The limitations of the move vs shoot options can be evened out with the cards, but you don't get very many cards.  We ended up with a real stand-off at the end, which I suppose is pretty realistic, but it was pretty dull.  I put myself in harm's way to move the game along and payed the price for it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Good looking game, but after I played it felt like a vital spice was missing from the recipe.  A rather bland game.  The smaller scenarios are very static with limited movement - just shoot (roll dice) until someone dies.  The larger scenarios are more interesting with movement options, but still end up at a static point where everyone is just shooting at each other.  I am also uncertain about the massive I move, you move aspect of it, especially with larger numbers of cowboys.  I am half convinced this game needs to be multi-player with each player controlling 1 (or perhaps 2) cowboys.  And with more players, some sort of system to randomize who plays to avoid the alternating sequence of play.  More players would also allow allow for a more social gaming experience.  (Notice that many other comments are adding house rules, playing with more players, randomizing who goes, etc also.)

RATING: 5.5
This one feels a little too simplistic and basic. The 'I go, you go' system favours the first player and a successful hit on an opposing cowboy is a huge benefit as movement is limited by health. There should be a way to better determine turn order (use of the cards ala blackbeard perhaps? Have each cowboy come with a better thought out movement rating?). The cards are too samey and overpowered at times (make opponent skip a turn, move and fire, move twice). The card deck could have been better used. The weapons are pretty much easy to hit up to 5 or so spaces away so it often comes down to getting in and getting the shots off first. Scenarios definitely make or break the game but much of the 'eliminate' the other side ones are really dull. I understand that the scenarios are often based on historical happenings but this means that some showdowns are very one-sided. I do appreciate the more complex scenarios. The components are very good but some more thought could have been put into the cowboy character cards and standups. 1) Use a wooden cube to track the cowboys life. 2) Why have three different standups for each cowboy? Sure there could have been a better way to mark this out on the character card perhaps? Will revise rating again after a few more plays of different scenarios.

In defense of this game, I only tried a quick Tombstone scenario.  The two sides were lined up four hexes from each other.  I guess it could be a more interesting game with some terrain and a larger map.  Each side in this scenario began the game with four cards.  The other side had three cards that were essentially useless.  Perhaps that and the dice rolls were what decided the game.  The cards seemed to be a bit similar to those used in Bang, but I think it will be tough for this game to pass Bang in popularity.  I don't think I'm the target audience.  However, it might be a good game for those between say the aged of 8 and 14.  On the upside the game played quite quickly, but shooting a gun from four spaces away seemed kind of silly.

This is not as deep as the old AH Gunslinger, but it's meant to be more game than simulation. In this, I think it does well. Interestingly with a theme related to a poker playing environment, both games use cards, so ya gotta play yer cards right!

RATING: 9.5
UPDATE: After playing this game almost 40 times since I bought it two weeks ago, I am revising my score. I now use almost all the optional rules which--honestly--should not be optional but required. They add a great deal to the game without much complication. Generally we have house-ruled that all actions take effect at the end of a turn in order to deal with the IGO-UGO issues. I have also played 6 games using the Riker Initiative Variant which adds a good deal of excitement as well. I do not give it a 10 because I don't believe in the "perfect game", nor do I wish to tempt the gods. :)

ORIGINAL COMMENTS: Beautiful components, very fast playing. Overall a good fun fast game. Easily adapatable to your own maps (though the ones that come with the game are very nice). The system is fairly simple and uses just 2D12. The cards add a nice element of surprise.I do definitely recommend this game if you like gunfights of the Wild West kind.

I'd personally prefer a system where the course of events makes better sense from a real world perspective. All too frequently cards decide the action, as one cowboy gets frozen in place while another runs rings around (and through) him, firing at will. So I can't recommend the game to anyone looking for a simulation, or to anyone who is concerned about a large element of luck. For players who just want a fun, quick game with a lot of flavor, this would be a very good choice.

Several official rule sets exist for Cowboys, which may be the first symptom of a war simulation packaged to casual gamers.  "Fast, Fun Gunfights" quickly bog down into a mire of cardboard chits, dice rolls, and reference tables.

Only played solo so far, but I quite like the system.  I'm a little baffled at the large number of scenarios in which a very small number of people shoot each other at very close ranges.  I know that's how it happened in real life, but really, the death of Wild Bill as a scenario?
My other concern at this point is that it's impossible to kill someone with a single bullet -- which, in the case of those aforementioned scenarios, is often what happened.  The game seems to be trying to straddle realism and playability and I wonder if it will compromise both.

Once all of the components are bagged appropriately, setup time is minimal.  Gameplay is fast and furious.  Ultimately, the game is dice heavy (and very enjoyably so), but there is a lot of room for maneuver and strategy.  The two quick games that I played involved everything from straight-up down and dirty stand your ground and shoot, to diving through windows, hiding behind furniture, and running like hell from Commodore Perry Owens!  Cowboys is everything that I hoped it would be - no disappointments here.

This is the Western shoot-em-up I'd been waiting for! Simplicity and ease of play are this games' strengths. Even if it had more competition in this genre, it'd still be the best in my book.

Fast, furious, and fun.  The addition of more players helps this game more.  Also, adding poker chips for each player, placing them in a Stetson, then drawing out a chip, then that cowboy gets to activate adds even more to this fun little game.

It was quick, light and fun. There was much laughing and cursing. I'd like to play again. Goes well with beer.

8/25/07 - Not really my cup of tea, but it was ok I guess, got better as the game went on...  lasted too long though.

After playing the first scenarios, seems like a "get in range and blast" type thing.  Hopefully it will get deeper with more play.  UPDATE:  after playing another scenario, it seems the game can come alive after all.  Can't wait to get deeper into it.

Traded for Attack 4/2009.

This game is ridiculous - a turn-based simulation of cinematic gunfights, where everyone dies within a few seconds - but it is unbelievably good fun.  I mean, really hilarious.  My favourite moment was when one of Bill Hickok's would-be assassins died before his first turn.

A very simple game that yields a fun time.  It plays fast, has cowboy and western flavor, and comes with great components like thick counters and mounted boards.  Well worth it for a very light version of Gunslinger.

I like the components, the rules were clear.  Liked the concept of poker for initiative, and the deck of event cards.  However, this game is far too light, its basically rolling dice and lacks any tension.  Needs a completely new ruleset to go with these nice components.  Suggest using Avalon Hill's RPG Boot Hill rules.  Having to literally fill someone with lead to kill them makes no sense at all.

Just not enough in this game to keep my interest.  For a similar game, I'd rather play Heroscape.

Simple and fast skirmish game where the theme is well implemented.

huh?

Looked very promising, but ... maybe it was just the scenario we played, but "you move, you lose". Tactical "decisions" were obvious in almost all cases.

In addition, this is essentially a 2 player game. In our scenario, the last character entered the game when 2 were already dead. Better have one person play all characters of each side.

A simpler rewrite of Gunslinger.  Good for kids (if you don't mind the gun violence).  Perhaps a bit too simple for older folks, but an OK filler if you do.

This is a cool little cowboy game and I have a bunch of minis that could go with it.  Yeehaw!

RATING: 4
A silly shoot-em-up that is only mildly fun - and even then only if played with a bunch of guys who can cut through the lameness of the game with their own Western-style enthusiasm and love of killing.

My winning strategy: stay out of the gunfights as long as possible, and then sweep in later, guns blazing, to clean up.  Just like real life in the 1800s, I suppose.

Generic, unbalanced, devoid of all fun and generally uninteresting.

I own it now and I still can't wait to play this one with my Dad and brother.  My Dad will love it because of the theme.  We'll all love the fact that it is quick and tense.

(Trade Interest: medium) seems a little trite, and there's not enough options to really do anything but move then shoot.  i wish Gunslinger were easier to explain to people.  Maybe adding a few rules, like rolling, or move and shoot, would help.  There's also not enough scenarios for varying numbers of players.

While some of the scenarios are quite "sparse", some have more "meat" to them and promise to be quite enjoyable. OK corral was underwhelming, while the final scenario with three players was a blast! A very good, lightweight shoot-em-up!

I think I have found a way to fix the lackluster combat for this game!  I will be using the combat system from Steve Jackson's Frag.

Nice components, but forget any semblance to reality.

IGO_UGO, and characters die through accumulated damage. A kill with a single lethal shot is virtually impossible. Even my 7-year-old son commented on that. 

Enough said. I'll stick with Gunslinger.

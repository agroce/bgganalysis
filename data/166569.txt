RATING: 6
This is basically a glorified version of Liar's Dice, a game I no longer have much interest in playing. 

That's okay though, because it improves on the mechanics, and enhances the enjoyment of the game, in my humble opinion. Liar's Dice is too simple. House of Borgia adds some complexity. Instead of lying about boring ole numbers, you're lying about benefits or penalties to lob on the por cardinals vying for the Popehood. Exciting!!

Plus, who wouldn't want to be the Dick Cheney of the Catholic Church doing shady stuff for the greater good. 

Buy (Homer whisper: or steal) this game FOR THE GREATER GOOD!!

I for the life of me cannot understand why this game is not more loved. It's a medium-light game that tends to stay out and dominate a night when I bring it out. Bluffing, deduction, and bold decisions make House of Borgia an absolute mainstay in my gaming group.

The Coup, Liar's Dice mash-up comparisons are apropos.  This is as good, or better, than both - so if you like that type of game you can't go wrong here.  The designer deserves a lot of credit for evolving the genre a step further while maintaining the simplicity.  Thumbs up for the choice in theme as well. 

We screwed up the rule about taking an action every time your bid/bluff is not called, but realized the blunder about 10 minutes into the first game.

This is a cross between Perudo/Liar's Dice and Heimlich & Co./The Name of the Rose.

WAY TOO LONG for 6  players...took over 2 hours. Will retry as 4 or 5 players.

Picked up via Kickstarter.  Only have one play in with 5 players.

Initial observations:

1) Fun, light bluffing and strategy game.  
2) Good quality components and art.
3) Feels like you have more control in your bluffing that you really do.  The numbers mechanism drives your bluffing more than your dice do.  The dice can assist you in defending a bluff, but by the time the numbers get high, it doesn't even matter any more.  
4)  The strategy is more in the timing of how many to bluff and how soon.  Start low?  Start high?
5) The influence on the cardinals isn't as strong as you think it is--unless you go straight for the jugular.  If you go straight at your cardinal, everyone is aware and then you will get bonked easily.  If you spread out the love, you dilute your ability to win.  No one correctly guessed who the other players' cardinal was.  We all ended the final score within 2 points of each other and the two top players tied because they had the same number of dice left.  

More plays needed to give a more balanced review.  For now, I find it an enjoyable, light, filler-game.

This looks to be an interesting mix of Lair's Dice and Coup, as advertised.  However, I think it is important that a game's theme facilitate understanding of the mechanisms.  Here I feel like the theme is too heavy-handed and gets in the way.

Well I'm not a fan of hidden role guessing games and not overly thrilled by Liar's Dice, so this one likely had no chance for me. I find games like this tedious and wonder if the I need to just not care too much when playing, as things seem too chaotic to make much sense of control.

RATING: 5
A good twist on Liar's Dice. You can just barely conceal your secret character and it can be a game of inches as everyone tries hard to stay hidden...but that's the fun and luck of it. The only hitch I detected was that players/characters who are on top of the influence stack at the beginning might have a slight advantage as early movement is tenuous, so those characters can accumulate good influence before being ousted. Knowing that, it seems like going forward that standard early moves will be to oust the top two characters in short order.

got my kickstarter and played a few games. I did enjoy this game. liars dice with a simple voting mechanic. The problem that we ran into is being able to guess who each other are if you have less than 4 people. I played with 3 and it seemed like we guessed very well very quickly and were right each time. So not good for small groups unless you are really good at not giving away who you are pushing to be pope.

I played a pre-published prototype of this game. I normally am not a fan of bluffing/hidden identity games but this game really made me come around on them.

There is a lot of great decision making going on in this game, I love the balance between rolling the actions you need to take and bluffing to get the actions that you may not be rolling. It is very tense trying to add influence to your cardinal, remove influence from those cardinals with more than yours, and keeping your identity secret all the while.

We had fun with this game and are looking forward to the coming KS campaign!

RATING: 5
On paper this looked like exactly the kind of game I love -- bluffing, interactive, with a great theme.  I enjoyed playing it with friends, but found that it tries to do too many things at once.  It takes a classic game (Perudo or Liar's Dice) and then adds other stuff upon it.  Some of that stuff is fun, but it makes the game feel more complex without being deeper, and with multiple personalities.  I enjoy this game, but given the option to play this or something like Coup, I would always choose Coup, a bluffing game that keeps it simpler and more exciting.

An ok game. It plays quickly = bonus. It is aesthetically pleasing, always good. I debated on backing this on kickstarter, but am glad I passed. A friend of mine actually got it so that worked out perfectly. It would have sucked if we both got a copy. I have never played Liar's Dice either, which is always brought up when describing this game. I am guessing I won't be a fan of that either. 

My expectations were too high obviously. It felt like a Party game, but a poor mans version - 6 max. We played with 4 (twice) and I have a feeling that it would feel tooooooo long with 5+

Maybe my opinion will change with more plays. I am more than willing to play again, and wouldn't be surprised if we were missing something that might make it better. Sometimes a game just needs the right group etc to shine. I don't know, but it was simply uninspiring and just didn't grab me.

Liar's Dice on steroids/made tolerable. Combining partial-knowledge bidding/bluffing with selecting an action works better than I expected. Some of the actions seem a little samey, and this is definitely better At higher player counts.

A speculative buy in the LoB Dutch auction (£3) as I liked the 'Perudo meets Coup' elevator pitch. It actually doesn't feel that much like either but was enjoyable anyway. The setup is each player being secretly assigned a colour (as in Clans or Candy Chaser) and trying to take actions which advance your cardinal's position without being too obvious, since if a correct accusation sits in front of you at game end, you are eliminated. 

The 5 actions are pretty simple but their selection is implemented Perudo-style. You have hidden dice with faces for each action (and a wild) and to take an action you state it with a number higher than the previous player's action. If it isn't called, you get to take it. If it is, the round ends and the incorrect side of the call loses a die. The game ends when one player's out of dice. 

My worry is that it could outstay its welcome if players didn't jump straight to high bids. But with our Perudo-savvy group that didn't happen and it was good fun.

This'll be my 4th published game with Gamelyn. It's a devious take on bluffing dice games like Liar's Dice/Perudo/Mia, mixed with some classic hidden role elements. I think this'll be a bit hit with the casual gamers.

Great variant of Liar's Dice. This is a more strategic version ... with a lot more backstabbing. The mechanism that allows to start a rumour for another player is brilliant (we play that if the rumour at the end of the game is correct, then the corresponding cardinal loses influences equal to the number of players).

RATING: 4
Scott Almes strikes again! Functional, but dry and a very strange re-implementation of the Liar's Dice mechanic (which just feels lame and anti-climactic instead of exciting). Accusation Mechanic feels frustratingly arbitrary, and the whole thing just feels incredibly blah.

Almes, like Schacht, often prunes out the interest in addition to the fat in his search for minimalism, and this game is no exception.

RATING: 10
Phantastic social deduction game with hidden goals. There are six cardinals that try to become the next pope. Every players gets to support one of them. Every player gets dice and rolls them secretely behind a screen. Then in a "liar's dice fashion" you announce an action, telling your opponents that at least your announced number of dice in the whole game show your action symbol. If your neighbour believes you, you can perform your action, if not, the round is over and every dice is made visible. If you lied, you lose a die, if not, you can perform the action and your neighbour loses one die.
Then some influence gets put on the first three cardinals of the letter and a new round begins.
At the end, the cardinal with the most influence becomes pope and his supporter wins the game.
I Love everything about this game! The hidden goal, the bluffing mechanism etc. 
The perfect game, play time is also not too long

- Extremely dull card play.


Why it's previously-owned:
It's too mindless even for a filler game.
I ended up giving this game away to a friend.  For a filler-type game, we prefer No Thanks!

RATING: 5
As a member of the Kosmos 2-player series, this is not the worst title, but it is definitely in the lower half.  The game feels a bit like the card game War with which it shares some common elements.  There are enough differences to not make it the same game.  Sure to be appreciated by those who enjoy a Take That style game or those who didn't play War enough as a kid.  [GTI Code: TGCL]

Another entry in the Kosmos 2-player line. This game is almost too chaotic with they way you can play cards on your own or your opponents side of the rope. That does make it fun, though. I also really like the speed aspect of setting up the decks in the beginning of the game.

RATING: 5
The Kosmos 2-player Kosmos range has been a publishing phenomenon, and many publishers have since decided to add a small  box series to their own range. Small travel boxes used to contain games to keep the kids quiet on the back seat, but, thanks to Kahuna, Rosenkoenig, and the Lost Cities juggernaut, these days it are the parents and slightly older gamers who have equally attractive titles to pick from. And smart publishers make sure they get a box on the shelves that cater for most, especially when the summer holidays are looming.

The Nuernberg Game Fair always seem to include a Kosmos 2-player title that is pitched at families, rather than more seasoned gamers, and it takes only one quick glance at the box to realise that this is it. The box lid promises a light and fun tug-of-war in an atmospheric Highland setting and the first few paragraphs in the rules make it pretty clear we got just that: speed deck-building followed by a take-that tug-of-war, and nothing to serious, as Nessie is one of the dames that can join your team of tuggers. Ace!

I can't think of any games that let you construct half of your own deck, and half of your opponent's, but it is a stroke of genius. Pick up two cards, put one on your pile, and one on that of your opponent. Since this game is all about differentials, as you can add tuggers to your own rope end, and that on the other side of the barrel, low and high cards are both good. "Score" cards are even better, and Event Cards can make or break your line-up, literally. Strength 2 cards without a "Heave-Ho" are the worst by some distance. In the deck-building phase, don't expect much time to decide which card to keep and which one to give away. At least not when you are playing my partner, who rattles through her cards at a 2-hand sorting pace that certainly doesn't involve actually looking at them. I hope. This phase is a blast, absolutely wonderful. Who cares if it is significant or not, it is the perfect analysis-paralyses cure.

What follows is the actual tugging, and although the rules could have been written a bit clearer, it is utterly straightforward. You will need a bit of fortune in the order in which the cards appear into your hand, and getting the right value and colour at key moments will be big step towards a victory. But small hand-management advantages will come and go, as chances are, that the barrel will see-saw for quite a few turns between vaguely capable players. Maintaining a slight edge is as hard as getting a large one and score it, even once. At first it might seem that it all is a bit random and inconsequential, but that is kinda deceptive, as there are many ways to get that Nessie on the table and have a reasonable chance of keeping her there, if you can afford to play with a plan and some patience. There are subtleties that, once understood, can make that first phase a bit more significant than you would suspect after the first game or two.

Since the dust of each of the 3 to 5 rounds doesn't take long to settle before the winner can claim the barrel, the repetitive mechanism is bearable. Still, the various event cards are welcome spices to a simple dish, even if their actual impact is usually not too dramatic. And that is my main reservation, it seems to lack drama. Players might inject their own frolics and entertainment, but the game on its own doesn't do that well enough. It is a bit too much about making small differences work for you. After 5 rounds of tugging, it does start to drag a bit too. 

The artwork is comical, and suits the overall feel well. It is the sort of fun quickie to play with kids, or when you are looking for something that doesn't tax the brain too much. Don't expect to discover a classic in the 2-player range, it certainly isn't one of the line's best titles, and most players will happily skip this and dig out their En Garde set instead. But some will find the approach here far more appealing and inviting than the more abstract Knizia game, and with the right age, attitude, or expectations, it ought to entertain (just) long enough to dig your heels in and pull 3 barrels your way. It is crying out for a drinking game variant for whisky lovers though.

There is enough text on the event cards to make this a small hurdle that needs to be overcome in the initial games, as you certainly won't have time to glance at a clue sheet when the other half is sorting their player decks at break-neck speed. Saying that, even complete familiarity with the cards won't help during that phase, as split-second decisions are all you are gonna get. Realising it is an event card is probably all you get to base your decision on. 

One note about the rule translations here: all say you can play an event card AND trigger the action. What they all mean to say is that when you play an event card on the discard pile you can choose to trigger the action, or PASS UP on triggering the action. In the endgame that subtle difference might come in very handy.

Beautiful graphics, novel and entertaining theme. Alas luck plays such an awesomely swamping role that I couldn't get heavily into it, or perhaps the real time aspect of the first round (where the first person to divide up 20 cards into two piles - one for themselves and one for their opponent, both gets a small head start in the second round semi-strategic tug-of-war, to play first, and in the best/worst case even gets to divvy up the rest of my cards if I'm too slow - which I am ;-) doesn't grab me much personally (I"m a laid back kind of player and real-time games often tend to both bug me a little and leave me losing. It's a light filler all the same, and not unfun to play, novel, interesting and beautiful.

I didn't understand the importance of the deck division until we actually played.  It helps balance the good cards between the two players.  There is significant incentive to finish dividing the cards before your opponent, so noone takes forever examining them and creating the perfect deck.  It can be difficult to recover once you get behind in a round, which is frustrating, but each round doesn't last long.  The Loch Ness Monster is a nice touch.  This game is addicting; we seldom play only one game.

Components: Great artwork on the strength cards, and the action cards are easy enough to read.

Experience: Perhaps too much like an actual tug-of-war, with the back and forth motion becoming a bit monotonous, or, even worse, one player achieving a quick, landslide victory. The card play seems so obvious that it doesn't satisfy me as a hand-management game.

Two Scottish players participate in a classic tug-of-war, joined on occasion by Nessie. Players first scramble to build their decks in real time. After the decks have been built, card play goes back and forth until someone pulls the whisky barrel across their line and claims it. First one to win three whisky barrels wins the game.

Rating is based on the game itself, but there are two things about it that would lower that number.  The "dirty tricks" card can be an instant winner, destroying any chance of keeping the game close, and therefore unfun.  Also, the speed set up is not to my taste, but it's fine.  However, the winner of that gets such a huge advantage (play first, closer rope, finish opponents deck) that it throws the game off.  Better to split the advantages (play first OR have rope closer).

RATING: 4
Amusing two player game featuring a Scottish tug-of-war.  Players play cards to a board to influence both their own or their opponent's team of tuggers.  When a How Ruck card is played, teams are assessed and the whiskey barrel (the prize) is moved closer to or further away from your winning mark.  Fun, light, but won't be regarded as one of the best in this excellent series of two player games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I can take it or leave it...  The speed setup rules are silly: there's no reason not to just deal out the cards as quickly as possible without looking, since the bonus for finishing first is so valuable.  The rest of the game is okay, but didn't excite me at all.

Some interesting ideas but ultimately an almost broken game. It starts quite cleverly -- first player to sort through their deck gets initiative. 

And the initiative bonus is REALLY substantial, making it turn into a race of blindly stacking cards.

Here's the stupid part: you can play cards on your opponents side. So it doesn't matter how you sort your cards -- if you get a bunch of good cards, you play them on your side, if you get a bunch of bad ones, you play them on the other side.

Not enough strategy to be worthwhile.  Hand size is very small, so choice of plays is very limited.  A couple lucky "monster cards" can usually tip game to one player.  Pretty random.  Speed-sorting will also benefit faster people over slower ones.  Over time, more frequent winner will be whoever can sort their stack of cards before the round starts!

The concept is good and the theme is fun, but the setup can take longer than it does to play the game. I know that the setup is part of the game itself, but with new players it gives the experienced player a huge advantage. If I find time to create or hunt down some good variant rules, it might get rescued from the eBay pile.

Fun. Especially during the card drafting part. We think this is the most 'excited' game in our collection. Have to act fast, be quick!
We do think that the cards need protector, because they can be easily damaged during the drafting session.

Also, the drawing on the card is hilarious.

Simple rules. Seems like it could be lots of fun and very easy to play with younger kids.
Worth getting, but not unless the price was right.NB: There are folks (on the Kosmos Geeklists listings) that say this is the worst of the bunch and has little re-playability. I don't see this; but then again, I haven't played it.

Comment from a couple's Geeklist: "There’s not a lot of strategy to this game, but there is a lot of fun, chaotic times and it really does feel like a tug-o-war. We don’t bother with the card sorting step, and we play for a jigger of single malt scotch (instead of the barrel pawn), which I think"

Once in awhile we get this game out and play it on quiet sundays while drinking coffee and listening to music.

Really cute game! Wife friendly, would be great with kids, nice bits, thematic, quick and FUN!

Update 8/8/14: I should have mentioned before that this game consists of about 20% strategy and 80% luck. It really comes down to the early draw. I can overlook that however, because it is so silly and quick. Nevertheless, I would put this game in the same category as Zombie Dice in terms of randomness.

RATING: 6
An occasional &#039;slapping&#039; game tempered by some of the effect cards which can cause your play to backfire. It seems as though slap hard &amp; early is a good tactic, but this depends on drawing the right cards. (The plus to this game is that you can actually give yourself good cards when building your team). Risky speculation as to what card to play involves remembering the 10 cards you gave to your oppenent, as well as considering the probability of what colours may be left. Problem is, card value distribution isn&#039;t uniform, so a little difficult to remember and implement on first plays. Spatially, a little repetitive and close games dependent on player attitude as to which cards to play. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The special cards in the German version were a bit hard to select during the distribution phase unless they were well studied beforehand. And introducing novices to this excellent and rapid filler game isn't a time for 'there'll be a test' study of the cards. Because cards can be played on either side, there are very few cards that can't be used against you when you make the initial 'deal'. So the major benefit of finishing first is having the barrel start on your side.

I suspect a lot of the game is in the team (ie deck) preperation, but to get there one needs to know the game well first.  For new players - skip that part and just randomly deal 20 cards to each player.  Game of card management and trying to maximize one's effort at the end of a round.  Can play to both sides of the board which is mildly interesting, but again makes more sense at the end of the round.  As a result, feels long for what it is, hope familiarity will speed up game play.  (My daughter seems to like it, but will see if she asks to play it again.)

 A lot of games use a tug of war mechanic, so it is nice to have a game that does that be about a tug of war. The card drafting at the beginning works well and adds a lot of tension to the game. Most of the interesting decisions come during the draft but the rapid pace of trying to beat the opponent makes it a challenge to make the right decision. I thought the mechanics and theme complimented each other well and this was pleasant game

A fun and light entry in the Kosmos 2-player line.  I like the deckbuilding/teambuilding aspect quite a bit, especially because my opponent and I really made a speed game out of it.  As for the tug-of-war gameplay, I liked that well enough, especially that one could play cards on either side of the line.  Makes one think twice during deckbuilding whether whether to keep the 1 for your deck or pass it off to the opponent.

Heave Ho! is a two player game with a tug of war theme,  that is as light on the rules as an actual contest of tug of war might be.

It's presentation is superb,  right down to the components that resemble root beer barrel candies.  In addition, any game that features an appearance of the Loch Ness Monster - here,  affectionatly known as "Nessie" - earns bonus points in my book.

 This game can offer some fun in a light back and forth battle,  but I strongly suggest you ignore that deck building / choosing nonsense at the start. Since you can play to either side, there is little difference in determining what is actually a good or bad card.

Heave Ho version. Not as good as I hoped it would be. Still I like it just fine. The speed element really adds something to this game. With repeated plays, the game improves.Unique situations arise which bring to the fore elegant mechanisms that were not immediately apparent the first couple times I played this. After about six more games, I see what really improves the game.The key element seems to be a few beers! Kosmos always delivers a pleasing package in style and content.

This is a fine light 2 player tug-of-war card game with a nice speed sorting element and great artwork - with all the Scottish lads and lasses straining to win.

This one was a little too light for my husband's tastes, but it's a great 2 player for me and my 9 yo son.  I love the theme and so does my son (who is learning to play the bagpipes).

a VERY fun game that surprised me. kinda reminds me of Duell a little with it's jostling for position and to and fro-ing. I also think the real-time silmultaneus chosing of cards by to deal out the decks for both players is really cool and a whole lot of fun. Make sure you put on your best Sean Connery accent or Austin powers, "i eat ba-babies for brrreak-fast!" voices. Since that time and more games, I've found the game lacking a little in replayability..It starts to feel a little worn.

This quick game was very fun. The 'deck-building' is really fast and much more enjoyable than I thought it would be, and like some of the other 2-players from rio-grande/cosmos it has good choices every turn!

Silly fun, but ultimately not very engaging after a couple plays.

The rounds resemble the matches of the earlier Klitschko brothers: when they come to the ring and knock out their opponent in 5-20 seconds. The same can happen here. If you have good cards, you might win in a couple of turns. Decreased rating from 8 to 6 because of this.
Probably the rule of dividing decks solves this, but this rule is boring.

Interesting concepts, but I'm not too keen on the speed element of the deck building part (but I will concede that it is necessary to avoid players from turning that aspect into an AP-fest).  Too much setup involved at the start of each turn.  Sometimes it seems that the actual playing is shorter than the time it took to get your hand of six cards to start.

After 5+ Plays: The humor wears off fairly quickly, and there isn't much underneath it.  Tug-of-war is an inherently boring template for a game, so if you use it you have to be careful to provide interesting twists.  This game simply doesn't.

I love the first part of the game, where you have to be fast to distribute the cards. This one is not heavy on strategy, but I always had a good time when playing it. Some cards are way too powerful and it requires some rules modifications to improve the game.

Dividing and choosing hands is the only thing that redeems this otherwise bland game.  Still, not bad for kids.

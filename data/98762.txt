RATING: 8
This game looks trivial for a wargame, but has fabulous design that, in play, conveys the tension of planning and implementation really well. There are just not enough resources, and mistakes bite hard. Good play is rewarded.

My one play reflected history quite remarkably.

The rules are very accessible, and it plays quickly for a great time/effort/cost/fun ratio.

Am really looking forward to another game.

RATING: 6
It's not as interesting as many of Martin Wallace's other wargames, but this one also lacks that Euro-element that his other games do, relying more on a dice-activation system (think [thing=9609]War of the Ring[/thing]). And admittedly, the follow-up game, ([thing=128098][/thing]), is a lot more interesting after another wargame-centric designer took the basic ideas of this and added really good chrome to the system.
    It would probably be fair to say that this is too long for what it is, but at the same time, it oddly is more enjoyable when playing by e-mail.

Fun, fast and simple dice cum card assisted wargame that is absolutely made for none other than the new wargamers and for the casual family gaming session. 

I'm not a historian on ACW but I believe this game is not meant as a simulation of that battle. Nevertheless, the game play was fast after the first two-three turns of getting used to. Strategy for tactical maneuver is slightly limited by the map size but being so made your every decision that much more important. 

Another excellent entry level wargame that's exciting even for my 6 year old son. Ranked along Gettysburg 88.

The first game left me cold. A lot of dice rolling (how the Fog of War is implemented in the game) limited my ability to execute plans. Also, it is hard to win as the Union, although that tracks with history.

My second game, as the Confederates, was better. And yet, after performing extremely well, the Union scored a victory -- a snake eyes roll after playing a rout card against five dead confederates. Much tighter game, but the victory felt (to me) cheap.

I'm not sure how much I like the game (in terms of actually owning it, versus just playing it), but I do applaud the fact that it is a new approach to wargaming.

RATING: 6
Even simpler than Richard Borg's BattleCry, this is the sort of game that reminds me of the old Columbia block classics: simple mechanics and simple combat. Wallace has taken it up a couple notches by having available command actions hinge on the throw of a clutch of dice that are modified by leader abilities and your hand of cards. 

The uncertainty of what options are available to you on a given turn coupled by the build-up of previous decisions (where to move your troops) makes for a surprisingly tense game.

I do wish that this were more of a "system" sort of game with a book of scenarios rather than being focused on just one battle.

(PS: I love Don Troiani's paintings. But publishers insist on covering them up with text and graphics. Too bad!)

My first Martin Wallace game.  I wasnt sure after reading the reviews, but I played a game at Prezcon and this is a brilliant design.  Shiloh is next in this series.  By the way, I won the first game I played as the Union (and historically the Union lost), so this game is balanced fairly well.

I've only played one game but I'm not likely to play another.   The board of this one seems to lend itself to paralysis and a Confederacy victory.  If the Union doesn't draw the Ford, and is unable to capture the Old Stone Bridge, there doesn't seem to be a way to successfully cross the river.   Plus there's the chance of randomly losing the game due to a rout card.  At least the game is quick.

RATING: 6
Fast playing and low complexitiy wargame. Unfortunately this game comes without innovative mechanics, that are typical for a Wallace.

+
Low complexity and fast playing. Beautiful map and decent playing pieces.

-
After a couple of turns this game turns into a meatgrinder. The map offers very little room for manoeuvring. So it's all about a few lucky dicerolls. The rout-card is a real stinker. A bit more chrome (flanking, historical brigades, etc) would make this game more interesting.

=
Essentially a decent wargame for novice players. Experiences wargamers should stay clear of this game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Easy to play light wargame which still manages to present some interesting decisions to the players.

The rout rule (cards) whilst necessary to keep the players sensible in their willingness to incur casualties are a little bit overpowered and can result in abrupt and unsatisfying ends to the game and is subject to the whims of 'outrageous fortune'. I would rate the game an 8 with this fixed and a 7 without.

House Rule/Variant - you can not play more rout cards on your turn than you have eliminated enemy units on that turn. This means if you do not eliminate any enemy units on a turn that you cannot play any rout cards that turn.

RATING: 4
Players take either the Union or Confederates, fighting at 1st Bull Run. Simple gmae where players take turns rolling a few dice, which dictates what orders are available to them this turn. Orders are move (and fight), fire artillery, and so on. Combat is rolling dice to hit, then re-rolling hits to see the effect.  Cards can be drawn to influence play, especially the rout card!  Victory is usually via taking objectives on the boards, but there is a whammy card that could give the game on a die roll. Graphics arent the best, particularly on the counters.  The game works, but is probably more for younger gamers... but why would anyone play this when Battle Cry is available?  Not for me.

This game needs multiple plays to understand how well it works.  It really captures the operational / grand tactical challenges faced by McDowell on the one hand, and the Confederates on the other.  Because the units are generic and it is an area movement rendering of a single battle some people will be put off.  But then they are missing a challenging gaming experience with a good representation of the issues of the original battle.  Excellent.  I hope Mr. Wallace does other battles of the ACW with the same system.

RATING: 7
Not necessarily C & C light in a scripted scenario; you roll a dice pool to generate commands and draw order/action enhancements from your deck of cards. There are specific area control objectives as well as immediate win conditions. Occasionally you might win by attrition, but the scenario times out when either draw pile is empty.

Well done and fun to play. I like the dice as actions, but only in small doses like this.

RATING: N/A
First play - Sep 17, 2011. I took the North and Chuck the South. I managed to take Henry House Hill and put a lot of pressure on Chuck. He brought up reserves to keep me from advancing further. Meanwhile he tried a counter advance towards Centerville, but I repelled him before routing near the end of the game. I had planned to roll for a route the next turn - but he rolled first and won. 

Fun game. But it took longer than I expected it would. Probably an hour and a half.

2nd Game - 9/28/11 - Enjoyed it a lot. As the north I won on a rout roll with only 3 cards left in the south deck. It was a desperation roll as I had not taken but one starred area (Henry House Hill) and so I rolled a "5" to win. It is a great little game. Just light enough that the dice do not bother me. It actually aces it a bit more fun and unpredictable and creates a ton of anxiety.

Simple game which I think should be played more subtly than how I played it the first time. This is particularly important for the Union player who has to create a good hand and wait for the right combination of dice results to create a plateau where he can - ideally - gain ground over the river. Not an easy task, especially where there is defensive terrain.

Played twice. A new take on gaming a battle. Test of Fire has some similarities to the Command & Colors system but just covers a single battle and has fewer components. I found that the dice dominated the game too much - in particular they restricted the potential for movement. C&C can also feel constrained - in its case by the cards - but is a better executed game.

Wargame muy sencillo y muy azaroso. las tácticas tienen su peso, pero claramente si los dados están contigo ganarás la partida.

An interesting attempt at doing a wargame with Euro tools, that is quite successful at certain aspects . Ultimately the blandness and the randomness of the mechanisms overwhelm the narrative though. Were orders dished out randomly in historical battles? No. Was the most important purpose of a leader to work out which combats should get miraculous point modifiers?  A game that makes it appear that way is missing the point. 

The other, technically impressive, aspect is that this arguably is a good intro to historical wargaming intro for kids.  Does the world need more kids playing wargames?  Not really.

RATING: 6
Light and simple war game however with huge random factor. Only for fans of the genre. The best conclusion is how I won the play as Northerns. 

One of scenarios for the game end says that the game ends once the deck of one of the players runs out. Then the player who controls at least 2 "stared" places wins. It is my turn and I roll 2 dice with "1", which means that I should draw 2 last cards from my deck. The game will end as soon as I complete my turn. The Southerns control all 3 "stared" places and are sure of their victory. But ...

To the end of my turn I can play all cards from my hand and I have 3 "Rout" cards. Playing each of "Rout" card means that I should roll 2 dice. If the total is less or equal the killed troops of my enemy then I automatically win the game. I've already killed 4 troops of my opponent.

1. I play first "Rout" card and roll 8 on 2 dice. Failed.
2. I play second "Rout" card and roll 6 on 2 dice. Failed.
3. I play third card and this is my last activity before the game end and my certain loss. I roll 2 on 2 dice and have the result less than 4 killed troops of my enemy. I win the game !!! 90 minutes of intensive dice rolls and thinking just resolved by one dice rolls. Face of my opponent priceless :-)

09/23/17 Played once. 
The box says 45 minutes. Pffft! If we'd played it out until one of us had run out of cards it would have taken about 2.5 hours. As to the components (cards, board, units, dice) generally they were fine. Although I question why they made the infantry units twice the size they needed to be. There was no reason they needed to be two times the size of the artillery units. I didn't read the whole ruleset, but my impression was it generally seemed adequate. Yet I did look up a couple of the cards in it for further info and sometimes all it did was repeat what was on the card. Overall Test of Fire is a nice low complexity intro level wargame of reasonable price, that's good for a few plays. I'd play it again, but I wouldn't buy it. I would have rated it a "7" if it had really played in 45 minutes. As it took thrice that long I rated it a "5".

After first play, I think this will be getting a lot more air time from me.Mem`44, battle Cry,and C&C colours kinda rolled into one with a Wallace slant on things.

Update: Far far better than Battle Cry could ever be. This is the system that should have be used for that game. A pity there`s no more battles for this game yet.

Further update.
Had several plays of this now and though still enjoying..two competent players will turn this into a slugathon stalemate. Almost trench warfare like.

It's not that this game is boring per se, although it can be somewhat of a chore at times: The game is just extremely random. You roll dice in order to determine what actions you can take. Then you chuck dice in combat and hope for the best. There's little in the way of tactical decision making as all the units are the same. The only real unique aspect is trying to attack up a hill which effects combat odds. The game kind of plods along at a slowish pace and once attrition starts to set it you'll be able to make some larger strides in the battle. I paid $8 for this game on sale at GenCon 2017. I wouldn't pay more for it, and it's an okay random dice fest. Don't pretend it's anything else and you're fine.

I tested Test of Fire with my oldest daughter.  She is generally up for playing anything with me so I used this as an introduction to wargames.  The game is easy to set up and explain so we were up and running in no time.  

Each turn, you roll your orders dice (union rolls 4 and confederates roll 3) which determines which actions you can take: draw a card, move, fire artillery, or use a leader's ability (basically a wild card). Combat is a result of movement.  Each side rolls two dice per unit (up to a max of six) with defenders rolling their dice before the attackers.  Hits are on rolls of 5's & 6's then you reroll hits to see if the enemy you hit retreats or takes a casualty by flipping the unit.  Cards allow a variety of actions or events which are played as indicated on the card.  There is some chrome in the rules (such as units on hills hitting on a 4-6 instead of a 5-6) that are nice touches.

Anyway, my daughter enjoyed playing Test of Fire so it works well as an introductory wargame.  If you are looking for a meatier game similar to Wallace's Gettysburg or Waterloo, you will not find it here.  Also, if you're a strict Eurogamer with an aversion to dice, this is not the game for you.

This is a decent, simple civil war game. I like the dice rolls determine what players can do on a turn (draw a card, fire a cannon, move troops, active a leader area). Adding in the cards gives players options and advantages throughout the game. 

The static board layout might get stale over time, but some optional rules suggest laying out the troops...alternating between players. The Rout card could be a little too powerful (if you roll a number on two dice under the number of enemy troops you have eliminated you win immediately). My main suggestion would be the troop counters could have been made half the size. With the small board (which I like), the counters just take up too much space.

My first experience with a war game, undertaken in spite of some 'issues' I've had with deciphering Wallace designs. Liked it a lot. Simple rules, easy to set up and play, although it takes a lot longer than the 45 minutes suggested on the box cover.
Rule book contains five pages detailing the actual battle, which took place exactly 150 years prior to the game's release on July 21, 2011.
With nothing to compare it to, I don't know whether it would satisfy 'serious' war gamers, but as an introduction to the genre, I found it engaging, and am anxious to try again. Comments based on two plays, one as the Union forces and one as the Confederacy; lost both times. 
I recommend it. . .

1 play, GenCon demo 2012

[b]--- Game Summary ---[/b]
The board, which shows the battlefield divided into areas, starts with a fixed setup/distribution of troops (mostly infantry; a few cannons) for the Union and Confederacy. Players each have their own set of dice, player aid, and deck of cards. They start the game by placing their leaders in any area with their infantry (Confederate first), then draw 1 card each.

On your turn, roll 3/4 d6 (Confederates/Union) to determine which actions are available to you, then use the dice in any order you choose.
[u]1: draw a card[/u]
5 card hand limit; if you draw extra, discard down to 5

[u]2, 3: fire cannon[/u]
If there's at least 1 infantry in the same space as one of your cannons, may fire at an adjacent area. Hit on a roll of 5-6, and reroll: 1-5 = retreat, 6 = defender allocates 1 damage. Each unit can take 2 hits before being killed.

[u]4, 5: move[/u]
May move a number of troops across borders: 2 if unmarked, 3 along road; 0 or 1 if so marked on board. Some borders have 2 numbers: use lower number if destination occupied by enemy.

[u]6: leader[/u]
May either draw a card, issue a fire order a infantry/cannon pair in same area, or issue a move order to units in same area.

If units from both sides are in the same area at end of turn, combat happens. Defenders go first, then attackers. To resolve, roll 2d6/troop (max 6d6): 1-3 = retreat, 4-6 = hit (target allocates hits). Alternate till only one side left, or until one side retreats instead of fires.

Union side wins if, at the start of its turn, it controls either 2 of the 3 objectives, or the Confederate home base. Confederate side wins if, at the start of its turn, it controls the Union base OR if either player is out of cards.

[b]--- Comments ---[/b]
This is a very nice, light, introductory war game ... just at my level! The rules, at least, are very straightforward and I think the dice for orders mechanism works well. I wonder, though, if it may be a bit too long? Hard to tell after just one partial game, though (against a 10 year old, yet!). 

I hope to play it again before I forget the rules!

In limited play (so far)... clean, fast, and fun. Very good design-for-effect use with the cards, and the MSRP ($30) is low for what you get. My first impressions are positive.

Dice driven wargame recreating the battle of Bull Run in 1861. Each player has a set of dice (four for the Union, three for the Confederates) and these are rolled to determine which orders can be performed. A one allows a card to be drawn (these cards can be played at any time and allow certain actions to be taken), two and three results in firing on an opponent, four and five allows units to be moved, and six results in a leader action being made, which can consist of any one of the other orders if a leader is present in a particular area. To win the game the Union has to either have control of three strategic areas when the game ends (one of the players' card decks is exhausted) or have a unit in Manassas Station. Likewise, the Confederates win if the three strategic areas have not been captured at game end or they have a unit in Centreville. This is a well designed game and the use of dice for determining orders is an interesting mechanism, although it takes away from the decision making somewhat. Combat is simple and also dice-driven, with infantry and artillery hitting on a five or six leading to either step losses or retreats. The game tends to get a bit bogged down at this stage as both sides attempt to clear units from a small number of critical points on the board leading to a certain amount of repetitiveness, and ultimately there isn't enough depth on offer here to keep even semi-experienced wargamers happy.

A good game, but the rules are sloppy, leaving out several important points.  I'd rate it much higher if the game had any publisher/designer support, but it appears to have been simply abandoned.

Yet another game where the dice gods can paralyse a player completely - not an enjoyable experience.

My first play against Marek (11) was fantastic. We were agonizing over every dice roll: not just attacks, but also orders at the end of the game. It went down to the wire.

Lots of fun. Very random, yes, but exciting and fun.

A great war game to play with kids.

Only one playing so far, but a few concerns.  Playing the Union is like trying to roll a stone up a hill.  Difficulty of getting the orders desired on the dice can be frustrating.  It appears that the Confederate player should burn his deck down as quick as possible and hope the Union is short on move rolls.  The Rout card looks like a disturbing way to end the game - regardless of how it is going.

Not a hard core wargame by any means.  Very light, fast playing and relatively easy to get in to.  Don't expect lots of details other than the historical setting but you will need to react to the vagaries of the battlefield.

As Martin Wallace tells it, there were only friendly kisses and great big bear hugs at the First Manassas.  In our game, at least, only one or two unlucky souls had the gumption to actually die.  Only a subversive pacifist would do such a thing.

Though I should say that [i]Test[/i] is laudable physical therapy for people who need their die-rolling muscles to get bigger.  Like, a LOT bigger.

Mandatory variant: After hitting, artillery do damage on a 5 or 6, not just a 6.

[i]Update:[/i]

Rating increased to a 6 when the Ford Card Placement optional rule is in effect.

Mandatory variant #2: The Rout card can be used for its original purpose, or it can optionally be used to change a retreat result into an instant kill.

Also, we originally misread the Friendly Fire card to mean that your opponent's first "hit" result (rather than one pre-declared die roll) is applied to his/her own forces.   The card is much more interesting and effective that way.

[i]Update #2:[/i]

If you don't roll Move actions as the Union player, expect to lose.

Fast, fun Civil War battle game. It's easier to win for the South. Board is hard-mounted and top notch. Cards are bland, especially compared with Invasion of Canada and A Few Acres of Snow. Unit counters are generic and uninspired. Box cover is amazing, a Don Troiani painting.

I love Martin Wallace's Euro, war euro, and war games, but was very disappointed with this.  It's not that it is simple - I actually prefer low complexity, low counter count war games.  The game is way too random for my tastes and very gamey.  For example, hey I'm within reach of achieving victory so I guess I'll spend two turns doing nothing but firing artillery shots that miss and accomplish nothing.  Or I'll move this very large army against 2 or 3 infantry tokens and inflict a bunch of damage while suffering very little in return, but I'm the one who has to retreat all my units because the defender has 1 half-strength counter left?  

There also did not seem to be many strategic choices either - confederates defended 3 spots while the Union forces kept trying to over run them.

Tries to capture the rhythm of Bull Run with minimal rules and succeeds. Not very detailed, but enough to give a decent impression of the event. Clever design, underrated.

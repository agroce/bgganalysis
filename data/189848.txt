RATING: 7.4
Definitely one of the better version of Munchkin to date, it's largely the same in terms of mechanics, but I like having those larger sized role cards distributed at the start of the game, and the comic artwork used throughout the set is great. Sure, some will rue that it lacks the sense of humor of its siblings, at least in the art department, because there are a few sillies on the cards themselves. But, all told, very solid implementation.

Such a fantastic adaptation of the Marvel theme on the Munckin gameline. Loving it!

RATING: 10
One of my favorite games of all time. Utilizes the Marvel theme very well and provides plenty of laughter to those playing. Strategy is huge in this game, but it requires a bit of luck and the avoidance of take-that by opponents to come out on top. Give me a choice for game-night and this will always be in my top 3. If you hate the take-that mechanic this game is definitely not for you, as people have to hurt others in order to win. Mystic Mayhem and Cosmic Chaos are must have additions as well! Recommended Players: 4-5.

RATING: 8
I've played a few different versions of Munchkin and am surprised at how well it translates. The basic gameplay of Munchkin Marvel is standard Munchkin but the Marvel skin adds a lot of unique flavor. It's a ton of fun to play, the artwork is great, and it is thematically appropriate. Definitely a must-have for Munchkin and Marvel fans alike.

Another great Munchkin game. Love the addition of the Shield Agent cards which give special powers AND provide you with a way to keep track of your level. A definite win for any Munchkin or Marvel fan for SURE!

Good, dumb fun. If you are in the mood for a brain burner that is pure strategy, then this stays on the shelf. If, however, you have some mates over who are in the mood for a fun game of backstabbing and general tomfoolery, then this is a solid choice.

RATING: 6
An "ok" version of Munchkin. We found we had some ridiculously long plays of this - maybe it is better weighted than munchkin? We had to play with the Listen at the Door variant in order to keep game length reasonable. I found that this had more situational bonuses/negatives than regular Munchkin (that may be rose-colored glasses) - so I think I prefer other Munchkin variants to this. But I still prefer this over Munchkin: X-Men.

Played with Andrew Hackard and Scott Haring, both of Steve Jackson Games, on 13 May 2016 at Chupacabracon 3.  I'm not a big fan of Marvel (never read comics, only watched movies), but the traps, one-shots, and the rest of the game was very balanced and fun.  It took 93 minutes, and we got the game for free afterwards.

Munchkin world with a Marvel crossover. I liked Munchkin and I am a MArvel fan so the game is great for me. I bought the expansions, basically they are just more cards of all: items and characters, the only special things are the dungeons. I don't consider them esentials for regular players. They might be esentials for Munchkin or Marvel fans. If you don't have any Munchkin copy, this can be a good option.

----------------

El concepto de Munchkin llevado al mundo de los superheroes de Marvel. Me gustó Munchkin como tal y soy fan de Marvel así que este juego me pareció excelente. Compré las expansiones adicionales, realmente son solamente más cartas de todo: objetos y personajes, lo único especial son los calabozos. No las considero esenciales para un jugador común, solamente pudieran ser esenciales para fans de Munchkin o Marvel. Si no posees alguna versión de Munchkin, ésta también puede ser una buena opción para conocer el juego.

I love the game and messing with your friends can be so much fun. The utility belt is kind of overpowered we thought so we took it out and have had so much fun. Game time can start to drag out, but with the humor in the game and the amazing out of game interactions (how many electronic devices on the table, music in the room etc), I can't get enough of it. I just wish that it didn't look so good... It's hard to mix it in with other Munchkin sets because of the art styles differences.

I enjoy Munchkin, and since I always played with a buddies copy, I wanted to get one of my own. And of course the Marvel universe, so this edition was a no brainer to get. I picked up the 2 expansions for it s well. A great edition of the Munchkin world. This is a great theme and everyone enjoys it.

Love this game. My dad, brother and I play this ALL THE TIME. Munchkin seems to provide different sets of strategies every time we play, and has the Marvel characters that I love. We bought the expansions and will continue to buy whatever Marvel expansions they put out.

Yes it's Munchkin, but it's Marvel Munchkin!! I don't get this to the table often, well because it's munchkin but, in my opinion its the best version of munchkin out there. Its theme fits perfectly as you are trying to piece together your own super hero and recruit other super heroes as well. The art is very good and the two expansions add locations which is nice. The card quality is very good I just wish they were standard sized cards. I would like to play this a tad bit more often but again its munchkin and munchkin has very little strategy. 

Stored in bitbox small. Original box stored in Box #X at Dad's.

Enjoy this even more than regular Munchkins.  Just something cool about using Cap's shield or Thor's hammer or having Iron Man join you in a fight!  Also really like the change up player cards leveling you up to win rather than typical racing through a dungeon.  Slight nod ahead of Munchkins.

RATING: 7
A more serious Munchkin for Marvel fans that does away with the standard Munchkin humor and includes superior artwork. People who hate Munchkin may like this version. I recommend giving it a try - you may be pleasantly surprised.

Pros:
* [b]+1 for including reversible shield agent cards for both genders.[/b]
* Includes an essential level tracker on the shield agent cards which blows away the standard Munchkin versions that ridiculously include nothing.
* Shield agent cards gives each player a unique power.
* Nice artwork straight out of the comics.
* Rich Marvel theme throughout the game.

Cons:
* -1 for including the lamest character ever created -  Spiderman. (sarc)
* Missing a game board found in deluxe Munchkin versions.
* You play as an agent of shield instead of a Marvel character.
* Missing notable characters like Wolverine. (Apparently due to licensing issues - see [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/213670/munchkin-x-men]Munchkin X-Men[/url])
* Neither expansion cover looks promising.

...and yes, there is strategy in Munchkin games through negotiations, when you play cards in your hand or when to go for levels.

This is a really fun and simple game.

I was never overly keen on the other Munchkin properties due to the theme but the Munchkin format synergises perfectly with the Marvel universe.

instead of fighting generic monsters or zombies, players battle the legendary villains of Marvel which is so much more rewarding.

Would of scored higher if there wasn't so much luck involved.

Really recommend the expansions too.

Play with daughter (6yo). She loves the familiar Marvel characters and playing co-op to defeat the enemies. Lots of fun but feel like monster ratio low. Because of this the players can't "Look for Trouble" enough and we often go several rounds without finding an enemy to fight.

(Update) Still one of my daughter's favorites but this has dropped a few notches for me due to exposure to other better games. Noticed a lack of any impactful decision making or strategy as we play the game on rails. Will look online for mods or adjustments to base game.

WHOA!! i played super munchkin once before, but this blows it out of the water! Super cool art, fun to play against villains and superheroes i read in comics from my childhood and that are being brought back in movies these days. It seems like this version can get really immersive with the expansions and even adding Munchkin XMEN and deadpool expansion to it. Glad I started playing munchkin with Marvel Edition!

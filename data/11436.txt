GAME: La Bataille d'Orthez
RANK: 4489
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The rules are a revision of the award winning system developed by Marshal Enterprises and cover the full range of features that were characteristic of the Napoleonic battlefield. The game is therefore designed with serious gamers in mind. - 
Its a real tactical fight of Napoleonic Warfare!!

Check http://www.tactiquesnapoleon.com/Maison.html for "Tactique Napoléon" as a Spanish variant to these rules, by bringing together the best of both!

The rating is for the game series' system only

Another solid volume in COA's La Bataille series. One of the few of Wellington's battles where he had the opportunity to be on the offensive. Plenty of good research has gone into producing  this game on the last battle of the Penninsular War. Generally speaking I really like this series as it does a good job of gaming tactical Napoleonic warfare, As   a critique on the series as a whole I would strongly recommend using the "Reglements Marie Louise" as the standard rules, after 30 odd years of tweaking, are quite complex and confusing. 
Sadly,the atrocious French in  this series infuriates me, I think the guys at COA  must have learned the language at the Derek Trotter School of French Language Studies : "La Bataille de les Quatres Bras" ...    " La  Bataille D'.
Orthez"                  Arrrgh!!!

Played the short 4 on 4 learning scenario. Interesting game. The base rules are complex (which i think are an older version of the regs). I recommend using Marie-L rules. They are more clearly written and a bit simpler. 

The La Bat system feels like an authentic study, and it is engaging and really immersive. With the exact orientation of counters being important and its wealth of status counters it can get a bit fiddly. Is it worth it? I think so for a full battle, this learning scenario does what it sets out to very well, but has not entirely captured my imagination.

-------

In the end whilst i find this game fascinating I also find it more effort than i can muster. Good bye La Bat, perhaps some day we will meet again.

Good game for wargamers.Beautiful map.Rulebook is detailed and sometimes unclear or not complete. A lot of historical notes.Some of the tables need some additions (Die roll modifiers in the text, but not on the tables).

Ah, La Bataille series game at last here in BGG.  Complex tactical Napoleonic game series. Rich in context but pale in execution.  However, the series game did draw a large crowd over the coloful counters (you almost see a 2D soldier from the counter in uniform colors) and the period maps. I always suspect this series is more of  collector items of some sort than a game gets played.  Anyhow, this series has an important position in the wargaming history. Just like Advanced Squad Leaders for WW2, La Bataille is ASL to the Napoelon affectionates.

3 Scenarios. Turn=20 Minutes. La Bataille System.

RATING: 3
La Bataille is archaic, overwritten, and chart heavy. After 20 years the publisher is actively fighting efforts to converge on a stable rule set.  In playing this, I liked the richness, but it didn't feel right.  Artillery, what artillery?  Just march straight into the guns, pass your morale check with the massive advantages that the British get, and blow the defenders away. Oman would love this, mais ce n'est pas la guerre.

Mostly infantry, which makes it one of the better starter games for La Bataille. Quatre Bras is smaller (one map) but has more combined arms. Auerstadt is also one map (and also mostly infantry), but less visually attractive than either.

RATING: 8
Good introduction to the La Bataille series as only a small number of cavalry units are present, and the rules are fairly tight.  Attacking with the British makes this situation different from the games that cover the Peninsular War.

I’m playing this with the ML rules and having an extraordinary duel. We are closing in on noon and both sides are convinced that they are loosing. This game is far from a push over for the British. It has also bought out the best from the French commander. End result is that we. Ontinue to shape and tweak our decisions in the hope of achieving victory.  Increasing my rating accordingly.

A most worthwhile addition to the La Bataille series of games. The game features two scenarios, each taking up a small portion of 1 map. These each make introductory scenarios that are quite playable in and off themselves as the French player has the option of engaging the British player early before reinforcements arrive or occupying good defensive terrain and try to hold out. The campaign game is a good two map game, which features a couple of twists to keep players on edge. 
In terms of game play, there is minimal cavalry and broken terrain, so artillery will not always command the battlefield as one would like. The lack of horses means the commanders will need to use their infantry as the decisive weapon, so some real tactical decisions will need to be made to shape victory. This makes it unique in the La Bataille series.
Finally, it remains one of the few games in the series where the French player begins on the defensive. Given the timeframe of the game, this should not be such a surprise. The game is well worth the effort!

After Talavera and Albuera where frenches attack british, at last a battle where british attack frenches.
Tough situation with broken ground. Interesting module.

This is a great introductory game to the series due to the lower counter density and the paucity of cavalry.

Using the latest Regulation rules with it. Must say its a very well supported game system, up there with ASL for fan support. Always thought the maps and counters for the games in this system looked good, but at times a bit too similar, In this one, Brits and Protugese against French, not too hard to tell the good guys from the baddies :) Rule book layout in respect to where the rules are isn't that good. Charts and tables, of which there are lots are also not that well sorted. Lots of looking through sheets to find the right ones. But when you play it... that's when you do see why this is popular.

I found the rules (even the simplified version) to be poorly written and sorely lacking in more examples.

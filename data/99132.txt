At the heart of 2019 are over-familiar euro mechanics of worker placement, cube harvesting and set building.  It presents commonplace trade-offs between income and victory points. However, it uses those mechanics in a novel, intriguing and well-developed setting; the contest between nations and corporations to exploit the resources of the Arctic.  

2019 is somewhat reminiscent of Imperial in that while it features states and their navies, it puts players in the position of corporations manipulating those states for their own purposes.  As in Imperial there is a temptation to associate too closely with a state you are manipulating, which will probably be unhealthy to your prospects of winning.  

Influence over states in 2019 is much more fluid than in Imperial, being dependent on the turn by turn placement of lobbyists (workers).  And while this is yet another worker placement game, the systems for determining placement order and worker actions, and for maintaining control by keeping workers in place are really well done, presenting plenty of decisions.

Beyond the fundamentals, 2019 offers some nice thematic elements such as the intervention of the Chinese, hostile to everyone and with the potential to end the game early; the Norwegians, who may just join the EU, strengthening it considerably; and shifting international laws that have a significant impact on ownership of sectors of the Arctic and on the fate of your drilling rigs.  My one criticism of the game play is that perhaps it runs a little long with more than two players.

The English rules are quite well written, although we found one or two ambiguities. Production quality is very mixed.  The board and counters are fine, although the choice of medium and dark brown as player colours plus brown for the USA was not sensible.  The wooden pieces are the very worst I have ever seen, both poorly cut and coloured.  I have replaced all the ships and lobbyists in my set.  The artwork is not great, but it is functional.

Essen 2011: First play, heavy duty learning curve to sort the rules which are a little frayed in places. Clever turn order mechanic, fast turn over of activity on the board and room for negotiation and deals. All in a very clever game that we enjoyed a lot.

After an initial reading of the rules, the game looks interesting but it reminds of Imperial.  I'm not sure how good it will be 2 player.  It definitely looks like a game that will be more interesting with more players.  For now, I think it's on my try-before-buy list.

I've played it once now.  Defintely needs more plays to figure out what's going on.  It's not Imperial since players can always switch which countries they're involved with; however, it seems the game does encourage players remaining where they are at (since moving may cost money).  This will take at least a half dozen plays to figure out what is going on.  However, I'm not sure if it'll get them before my interest wanes.

Just played a second time and really enjoyed it.  None of us had any idea of strategy so we just kept trying to knock each other down from moving too far ahead.  Many more plays needed.  I hope to play this many more times.

Governments trying to reach national goals through the locus of actual power, corporations. Great theme and rules. Not a huge fan of the cover art or name (PS new cover from art in manual?) but suitable replacement for Risk, etc.

RATING: 8
Interesting game.  The game state may be somewhat too fragile to support any kind of long term strategy, but there are lots of compelling choices here and points for tactical leverage.  The break from the dynamic of most portfolio management games is refreshing. I would definitely play it again.

Publisher released 2 games last year that were both interesting, albeit with flaws that kept me from really latching onto them. Interested in trying this one.

RATING: 7
Could be a very good game, but production quality is very mediocre. Different player lobbyist pawns are totally confused and platform marks too. US and Norway ships also can be mixed.

With a different and better production, this game could rise to 8.

Strange game, still do not know what I think of it. The game did not play as I expected - not a bad thing.

RATING: 6
Only played once and was disappointed after having had high hopes. Seemed very hard to make progress as you had little control of any country's actions: maybe this points out that it would be stronger than with fewer than its full complement of 4.

Good and original mechanic, interesting climate of war and politics around North Pole, nice board but poor pawns quality.

Gain VP's by mining resources in the Arctic. Worker placement game where the players are investors and take control of five powers in the Arctic region, like Imperial. But there the similarity ends... High learning curve, high player interaction. Need to play more for better judgement, but I like it already

After a 4p I think this game is best to be played with four. Much struggle, hard to get your platforms running and watch those boats in pairs, they might be heading your way.

really clever near future struggle for limited resources with politics, influence, money and combat.

the board is abstract and hypnotic.

RATING: 9
Very interesting game mechanics.
It is really interesting to see how players iteract when you don't control a country but lobby for them.
I would recommend it.

RATING: 2.5
In my first play, I found this game pretty chaotic.  Maybe it's because we didn't know the proper strategies or tactics, but it seemed that it was hard to wrangle the countries to do what we wanted them to do without opposition.  I would need to play again to appreciate it more... but I can think of many more games I'd rather investigate further than this one.

Another thing... the colours of the wooden pieces suck!  And the boats don't match the lobbyists!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The game is great and really fun to play, but the components suck big time... 

If you plan to improvise and replace them with something else, then you have a chance to be able to play it. Playing with the included components it is almost impossible. 

If the components were decent I would rate it 8.

Gioco complesso e articolato, che ricorda molto Imperial. Difficile controllare tutti gli elementi, anche per la quantità e somiglianza dei colori utilizzati per distinguere le nazioni, i giocatori, i pozzi petroliferi, ecc.

RATING: 7.5
Long (but absorbing) mix of economics and wargaming driven by a worker placement mechanism. Not one for the easily offended as there is a lot of scope for conflict/screwage/leader-bashing, but if that's not an issue (and it isn't for me, being a wargamer at heart) then this is a very good game on a very original topic.

You really need to keep an eye on the end game scoring conditions as they can easily double or triple players' in-game scores. 

It's not a showstopper, but ease of play would have been improved with more easily distinguished colours for action pawns, oil rigs and country control markers. The muted colours look nice, but there are some very similar blacks/browns/orangey-browns in there. We ended up playing the black action pawns upside down to distinguish them from the dark brown ones - but even then a few mistakes were made.

RATING: 7
Even with the new pieces, some of the graphic choices are not great.  However, the game play is very exciting and tense, with relative power shifting constantly.  There's a lot of interaction, and figuring out the best play is challenging.

Very promising mix of economic game with direct conflict and voting. Remotely reminiscent of Imperial (you control nations to do your bidding), but filled with many interesting novel mechanics.

Rating might go up.

I think this is a good game, but I need to play more, rating is prelimenary. I like the theme. The mechanics are mostly worker placement. The positions did not change after round two in the one game I played. We probably need to use the mechanics better to hit the leader. It is an interesting game, that put my brains to work afterwards too.

Played two 3-player games on the way back from Essen. Elegant, interesting. A bit of Knizian mathematics in the scoring that I'd throw out if this was my game, so don't play with the worst AP-people. There are so many strategies; I'm already thinking about how to play next time. Can't wait for the next play. This might be my next present to myself.

The downtime can be quite big. I don't "feel" this game and most of the time I'm not sure what I'm doing. Heck, I'm not fond of strategic games. I played Arctic once - and won only because I convinced the two out of four (incl. myself) players that the third one is the biggest threat :P
Our copy is second-hand and it came with already exchanged set of components. The two brown sets are still too similar to each other, though.

I giocatori si trasformano in lobbisti alla ricerca delle poche materie prima rimsate sulla terra ormai devatata. Influenzando le principali potenze mondiali si cercherà di estrarre dall'Artide quanto ancora disponibile guadagnando soldi (sempre troppo pochi a disposizione) e punti vittoria. Un gioco molto cattivo con una forte interazione che richiede una buona programmazione.

Very complex and innovative game. Game mechanics will force you to make a few games before you fully understand them. In the first place the game might seem too difficult - but later you will easier understand which strategies have a certain impact on the game.

Unusual theme in an economic / war hybrid. Longer and more fiddly than I prefer, and some unfortunate art/color choices, but if you like medium/heavy economic games with conflict and ability to manipulate neutral forces (players are mining companies whose lobbyists are used to make countries do stuff), well worth checking out!

I revised the English translation and helped hash out some rules questions with Andrzej.

I played this game on a night few month before at the "Metal Castle".
The theme is pretty interesting, and it's about the strive of energy in arctic at 2019.
But this is my first play feeling(first half game)
Besides the art style is pretty cool. Love purple.

Okay, gameplay wise this is a real gem. Fantastic mechanisms, lots of balance and multiple paths to victory. Perfect (imho) level of concentration and AP required to win, with a decent splash of diplomacy. This game would be in every serious gamer's shelf if not for...

...the quality of the components. They are terrible. Worst I've seen yet, and I think the original Titan is a masterpiece of the graphic arts. Seriously, some big publisher needs to make a version 2 of this game. It will rock.

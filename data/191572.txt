Animals on Board bears obvious similarities to [thing=27588][/thing].
Infact it plays like a simplified and abstracted version of Zooloretto, yet with a one or two interesting twists, which give the game a similar deepness. In both games you collect different types of animals, in both games you have to decide each turn, if you modify the display of availablke animals groups or take one of them. The main attractiveness comes in Animals on Board from the fact, that you are not just randomly drawing animal tiles, but splitting a given group of animals into subgroups on your turn. Also the scoring (you have to avoid having exactly two of a kind at the end) in combination with the secret staring card bears some allurement. 
Animals on Board feel less thamatic and picturesk than the "Spiel des Jahres 2007" with it's large animal enclosure boards. On the other hand it's faster, simpler, yet gives you often even slightly more options on your turn. 

Yet, two things are annoying, though, and keep the game from a good solid 7-rating.
Firstly the annoying amount of (very relevant) hidden trackable information. Other than in Zooloretto, the aquired animals are keept hidden.

Secondly the game is made only for 2-4 players, where a 5th player would have been easily possible. The animal tiles are already enough for 5, so only a 5th arc (=tile holder) and 4 more food crates would have been needed, which is infact just one more cardboard sheet to punch tiles from (9 instead of 8).

Basically they could have dropped the arcs (which don't look like ships anyways but are basically just simple tile holders) and just let peple lay out the animals openly (except for the few secret tiles) in front of them. Then not only 5 players would be possible without extra material, but also the game would have fitted into much smaller travel box and could be sold for 10 to 15 instead of 20 bucks. Also the annoying memory part would fall away as well as the problem of people being able to look into each others cards (the arcs are not that good in hiding the tiles).

Thus the game would have justified its existence - despite the obvious similarities to Zooloretto - by being a much smaller, cheaper and quicker while equally tactically challenging game.

But the chance was mostly wasted here unfortunately. Though of course you can mend the game partially by changing that hidden rule (thus automatically making it playable with 5 also), but of course you still have the much too large and pricey box then.

Final Rating: 5.5/10 (could have been a 7)

Animals on Board (or Noa as I became to know this game) is a very typical family game in a good sense. Situations that arise are complex enough for adult gamers but there is enough room for intuition as well. There is a memory element to the game with some room for chance but neither of these dominates the experience.  Actually the balance here is quite nice. 

The art is functional, and I would even say pretty. Theme is easily approachable and the rules fairly simple. Now that I think of this game there really is not anything not to like but at the same time no aspect of the game is exceptionally well executed, imho. If I had to pick the best quality about the game, would it be the good contents vs. playing time ratio.

1st play - Every once in a while a game comes along that almost perfectly distills a mechanic into it's pure form and makes a pleasant experience.  The animals and art are great and it plays fast while being accessible to all ages.  The components make it even better.

2nd play - Lots of interesting ways to play the divisions, pushing your luck to go for animals that will get you to a herd, or staying safe with a lone animal. And Noah is ruthless with taking pairs of animals.  Happy to play this anytime.

A very clever little game of set collecting with a twist - collecting pairs scores nothing, but collecting single animals or sets to 3-5 scores well.  Gorgeous artwork and components.

Cute game, and definitely has a little more thought to it than most people will think by looking at the box. The decision to split or stow animals for scoring is usually a tough one, because you might want to work towards the prevention of another player scoring a particular set. The art is nice and the theme is appreciably bonkers!

Good family level game. It isn't great with three though as we found it is mostly (for some reason) possible to score near 50 most times. One four player game was much more varied and (with only that one four player game to go on) I would say four is much better with more competition for the tiles.

Absolutely deserves the love it's been getting. A light 20 minute game, which has more strategy to it that you might think. A game where you are trying to make sure that your opponents don't get good groupings but where you don't miss out on the animals you are aiming for.

Do you play it slow and go for a large herds of animals, or do you save up to quickly trigger the end of the game, getting enough points to win before your opponents have collected anywhere near enough animals to compete.

Another game where the rules are few and the strategy is great. This is an "I split you choose" game of set collection, but if you end the game with two of a type of animal, they're won't score you points. Only two possible actions on your turn makes the game a good candidate for older kids, but there is enough strategy tht this game is good with all ages.

Initial Impressions:
------------------------
Probably a little light (which i knew going in), but "I cut, you choose" is one of my favorite mechanisms in a game, and I think it is really fun in this game.  As the game goes on, the choices do get more and more interesting.  Having the hidden animal per round is adds a good amount of decisions too, since if you are sitting at 2 animals of a particular type, with no other good way to get the 3rd, it can be super tempting (and can totally backfire on you.. like it did for me).  Wouldn't be shocked if this won the SdJ for 2016.

Zooloretto superlite - only real decision is do I split a group or take a group.

Super cute artwork, but it's just an abstract with no real theme/mechanic connect. My main issue is the hidden trackable information, you mostly know what your opponents have collected (if you can remember) and that should influence your splits - if you can be bothered to try to remember, either that or you play it multiplayer solo.

Overall, I'd much rather play Zooloretto for a collect animals & drop or add an option for the other players type mechanic.

It's just drafting, and I'm beginning to get sick of these type of games. The one interesting thing about this particular game is the scoring mechanism whereby you don't want pairs, which does actually make some of your decisions painful, and allows for some meanness if you want to "sour" an opponent's collection.

Like all "drafting-only" games, however, there is such a reliance on memory that unless you have a really good memory (which isn't fair) or you're trying really hard to keep track of everything (at which point it's no longer fun), the end game is ultimately arbitrary.

A decent little card game that was packaged up with tiles and tile racks to make it seem like a little more than a card game.

I would akin the feel of this game to Coloretto, as you're attempting to set up groupings of cards that are appealing to you, while being not useful to the other players, except the way the game works is mechanically a bit different.

Each round, you start with a grouping of 11 animals. On your turn, you can either split a group of animals into two smaller groups, taking a food token each time you do so, or you can claim a group of animals, paying a food for each animal in the group. When the game ends, you score all the animals you acquired according to some scoring rules (basically, you'll want to avoid ending the game with pairs of animals).

All-in-all, a decent filler card game, but I'd likely choose Coloretto over it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.6
Spiel material.  Very clever set collection game with an "I split, you choose" central mechanism.  It has hidden, trackable information which can aggravate some, but not something I mind.

It has that trademark German Euro quality where it's very simple and can be played in laid back easy going fashion, or more competitively with more friction and a cutthroat nature.  Really dig this game.

The only real strategy in this game comes as a result of paying attention to and remembering the animals that the other players have taken. Doing that can be a lot of work, especially in a game that so clearly is family-oriented. However, the game is a hoot and quick to play.

In Animals On Board you are collecting animals from a central pool. On your turn you either split the pool up into piles or you take a previously split pile by paying for it in food. It is neat and clever as you try and create piles of animals which are attractive to you and not to others. 

A twist is that if you end up with 2 of an animal type then they are worthless. You either want one of a species or 3+ of a species.

It is fast and fun. Good as a filler or as a family game.

For now, though, it seems light, super-cute, easy to teach, and based on one of my favorite mechanisms (not to mention has allows the players to determine when the end-game triggers, which I also love). Is this a sort of 'Piece o' Cake' for small kids?

Often, losing a game at first makes me like it more-- see, there's depth! it's a challenge!

The fact that in my second game, I not only lost, but lost to someone who was within two points of a perfect score, definitely dented my enjoyment pretty badly.

But the animals are so cute and the mechanics are so elegant!

Shouldn't animals be worth more the younger they are, though, rather than the older they are? I'm just saying.

This is an enjoyable light game. On your turn you have two options: 1) you can split a group of animals on display into two groups and gain a food token, or 
2) you can spend X food tokens to take a group of X animals into your private display.

When you choose option 2 you are out of the round. When everyone is out the animals left on display become one big group again and more animals are added. The game ends when someone has 10 or more animals collected. You lose all pairs of animals you have, but keep singles, or triples etc... If you manage to have 3 or more of an animal type they are each worth 5, if you have singles they are worth 1-5 depending on the number printed on them.

It's a fun little filler game. Not the type of game I would seek out, but one that I would happily play whenever it's suggested.

I really like the fast play time, the simple rules, and interesting decisions I have to make.  It packs a fun little punch, I just wish it could seat up to 5 like Piece O' Cake (a game that feels somewhat similar).  There's some fiddliness around how many animals types can be used based on the number of players.  It's a similar issue that Zooloretto has where you need to sort through and find which types to keep out before playing with less than 4 players.  

Overall though, quite enjoyable.

Fantastic game for kids and gamers alike.  Simple mechanic of split a group to get food crates or lure animals to your ark using those same foods crates.  Noah takes any of the animal pairs before scoring.  Lots of tough decisions in a very quick game.

RATING: 5
FIRST IMPRESSION:

This game is way overproduced and I'd prefer it in card form but it does look nice on the table. Game play is very simple - either split a group of animals into two groups and take a food OR spend a food for each animal in the group and take all animals in the group into your ark. Final scoring is set collection with a catch - you do NOT want a pair of the same animal as they score 0 but collecting 3+ of the same animal makes each one worth 5 instead of face value so that's the rub/push your luck aspect. I don't need to own the game, but don't mind playing from time to time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
High quality components. Nice art. Would be better as a card game though. Has the feel of Zooleretto in terms of set collection, but different mechanics. Better game than Zooleretto.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Good light game for adults or kids.  I like the simplicity in the rules and the component quality is also good.  Little arks are a very nice touch.  I even enjoy the food tokens, but of course the animal art is the best part.  Very cute.

There certainly is strategy to it (although more accurately, there is tactics.  Not so much high-level strategy).  But it's not a deep thinker either.  A bit of a memory game in remember what other players have because how you split things really affects what they can do.

Overall an enjoyable game to play when you just want a few minutes of fun.   Really the only things that could be improved would be a few things with components that my preferences would be different on--nothing big.

Nice, lightish "King Solomon-style" (I cut, you choose) set collection game. There are sets of 5 animals, which players try to collect. 1 animal of a type scores face value (1 to 5). 2 animals of the same type "go to Noah" - i.e. they are discarded. But if you have three or more, they form a herd and score 5 points each. Lovely cardboard arks - this game looks gorgeous. Definitely one to get for the PAX Aus library if possible - it's easy to teach, very accessible, and has beautiful components. Zooloretto meets Aber bitte mit Sahne.

Pie-splitting mechanism is always fun. The arks are neat. I think this is better with more than two players, probably, but decent with two and plays fast. With four, it's ok. Maybe a bit light for gamers, but for a family game, this is decent. My family just wasn't thrilled.

A pleasant, light, quick game. I enjoy games like this where you have a small set of potential actions on your turn (in this case only 2) yet where there is significant emergent gameplay.  I'm usually only interested in one or two plays of this in a setting, but it's a nice diversion from more serious fair, and most people I've shown it to enjoy it.

RATING: 7.5
Very simple game, once players wrap their heads around the process of splitting groups (animals' orientation within the group is irrelevant; many players assume you must split the group by groups of touching pieces). Plays fast and some opportunity for good plays, but a large chaos factor leads to frustration of plans foiled possibly without premeditation. Recommended.

RATING: 7
This is a really simple game of set collection and timing. 

It uses something of a 'you divide, I take' mechanism but not quite in the traditional sense. It is also somewhat reminiscent of Zooloretto or Coloretto in that you are trying to take things you need without getting stuck with crud you don't. 

I really like this. It is really simple and for some I think it sits nicely between Coloretto and its more bloated cousin. 

This is a gateway to be sure but the timing, food collection and game end trigger make this one a keeper.

RATING: 4.2
Outwardly, this seems like the sort of rules-light, tactically rich game I'd love, but this can't hold a candle to similar drafting games like Coloretto, Piece o' Cake, or the recent Imhotep. The decisions seem extremely obvious and I think that house rules may be in order for me to wring some future enjoyment here... 

- The arks either turn the game into one of memory or one of multiplayer solitaire, where you give up caring about what your opponents are collecting. It almost certainly would be better for me if all tiles were played as open information (except, perhaps, your initial draw?). 
- The arks themselves are annoying components which initially seem cool, but create an annoying situation where you can't ascertain how many collected tiles a player has. Yes, you can ask, but they definitely are a case of component style over substance.
- The limit on the number of food that you can collect seems to eliminate some potentially potent strategies. Not sure that I like the rule...
- Luck of the draw should be mitigated. It's annoying that animal tiles are reshuffled each round and that some might never come out. It might be better to form a discard pile and only reshuffle after each tile has made its way into the center of the table?

Still, I feel like I'm trying to do design work here on a game that clearly feels inferior to games that I already enjoy and that already play in a similar time frame...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Not sure how long it will hold its appeal, but so far so good.  Kids (5 and 7) enjoy it - the artwork certainly helps in that regard - and still holds interest for me.  Better game than Piece of Cake, which shares a similar I-cut-you-choose mechanic. 

OCD side of me worries about the ark tile stands and how they'll hold up over time...this is the rare game box that's filled to the brim with the game components (mainly, the four tile holders) rather than lots of air...

A quick family game with a Coloretto/Geschenkt style turn angst of whether you can wait for yet another round before picking up a set. Also has a small memory element because the collected tiles are hidden from others.

I played this at my local convention and fell in love. It's so simple, and I suppose therein lies the attraction to it's elegance.

Not much to say here, the 3D arks are a nice touch. I appreciate the fact that everything is cardboard tiles, it would have been cheaper to use cards instead. Overall, good gateway game for kids and families.

Also, it's a solid game that's based on a "Christian" theme...we all know how great those games tend to be. (*sarcasm*)

[i][COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8 -> 6)[/COLOR][/i]

[i]I ended up playing this quite a bit with my family, my girls especially loved the theme/artwork. While fun at first, repeated play took a lot of the shine off the game. It's hard to put my finger on why, but it definitely began to feel repetitive and somewhat random since a varying number of tiles wouldn't come out each game. I understand it is a light, family game so my criticisms may seem off base, but once I played N.Y, Slice I new I didn't need Animals on Board in my collection anymore. 

In short N.Y. Slice adds a bonus tile that gets placed each round which helps each game play out differently, only three slices are randomly removed from play each game which stops you from having perfect knowledge of which tiles are out while not introducing too much randomness and the scoring is more straight forward and easier for folks to grasp [i](especially non gamers)[/i]. All in all I think N.Y. Slice is the superior I split you choose family game and I'd highly recommend it over Animals on Board.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]- This is a perfect gateway game for families, you can teach this game in a couple of minutes.
- The artwork is amazing and the components may be a bit over done but they are beautiful.
- This is the first I pick, you choose game I've played and it was a blast.
- A different (and thematic) take on set collection, in the end you DO Not want to collect pairs of animals since thy won't score you any points. Therefore you either want one animal of a type that has a high number value or 3+ animals of the same type (then they are each worth 5 points).

I've only played this once, but I has a lot of fun. It was my buddy Mat's game, but he hated it and gave it to me. I can't wait to play this with the family, I think they'll love the interaction and my girls will love the animal art. I have a soft spot for simple games that give weight to the decisions you make and Animals On Board delivers.[/i]

Amusing rather light game for which the sweet spot concerning number of players is 3 imho. Played one 4-player game and for my taste 3 turns (so 3 possible splits before you can grab something) is just a bit too much.

Adorable simple pie cutting game. You have to collect animals on your ark. But you don't want sets of 2- Noah takes the sets of 2 away. Really easy game.

I can't help but LOVE the art. Super cute- we need more cute games like this.

This is a short I split you choose game where players can either break up a lot of tiles, and gain a food, or spend X food to take a lot of tiles at X size. If at the end of the game you wind up with only a pair of animals, then they get discarded. Big points from stacking up lots of the same. It's fine. There's nothing wrong with it, but nothing that got me excited about it either.

A promising Coloretto-ish "I cut, you choose" thing with tiles instead of cards. You're collecting sets of animals to load onto an ark, and if you get a pair, you lose them both to Noah, who's evidently building a competing ark. Hey, it's a clever idea. I don't think it's nearly as good as Coloretto, but it's a light, somewhat engaging game that's pleasant enough. 

Not terribly good 2p, so it may be best to pretend it says "3-4 players" on the box.

For a family game, Animals on Board is great. I love the split and take mechanic. It's great for the 10-15 minutes it takes.

Simple and fun, feels like a classic. Coloretto mated with Rummikub and made Animals On Board. You could play this game with a Rummikub set or a couple of decks of cards but the production certainly helps. Even if I have no idea why I'm doing what I'm doing (or why a pair of animals on the ark gets no points at all) the animals are cute and the ark racks are impressive. Enjoyable with kids, adults, or a mix.

A kinda Coloretto/Zoloretto relative. 
At least from the same herd (pun!)

Instead of building a Zoo, we're putting animals on an Ark. (Some resemblance there). Only Noah screwed up scoring by copyrighting taking pairs - so pairs of animals are verbotten (zero points), but having 3-5 is worth a lot and having one depends on which one. 

Instead of putting tiles/animals on trucks, we're passive agressive somewhat differently - splitting groups of animals into smaller groups or taking a group. The clever bit: to pay for animals you need food, to get food you need to split groups. Timing and positioning oneself matters. 

However - instead of open information Zoos, the Ark content is top secret and some tiles are completely hidden from other players. This gives a MPS vibe I'm not fond of. Would love to try it with open information.  

Another issue is that the gameplay is not as straighforward - split/choose mechanism and the way sets work might be a bit counter intuitive for kids.

A játékosok állatokat gyűjtenek a bárkájukra. 12 féle állatból 1-5-ig számozva 5 található a 60 lapkán. A játék végén, ha egy fajta állatból egyet gyűjtöttünk, akkor annak értéke a ráírt szám, ha párban vannak, akkor nullát érnek, mert Noé elveszi őket, ha három vagy több sikerült egy állatból, akkor mindegyikük 5 pontot ér. Amikor ránk kerül a sor a 12+1 fős falkából vagy megvesszük mindent darabonként 1 pénzért vagy felosztjuk őket bármilyen formában. A játék akkor ér véget, ha valaki összegyűjtött 10 állatot a hajójára. Ennyi az egész. Egyszerű kis játék, némi memória elemmel. Figyelni kell a többieket mit gyűjtenek és lehetőleg nem jó falkákat hagyni nekik. Van szerencse a lapkák felfordításában, de azért van ráhatásunk a játékra. Tetszett, nekem a San Marco elosztó mecahnizmusát juttatta eszemeb a falkaszétosztás lehetősége.

2 plays, 2er

Despite the very cute artwork, this is just not for me. For the I-split-you-choose mechanism, I'd much rather play Piece 'o Cake! To do well here, you really should remember how the other person has chosen to split and what they've chosen to take previously. I can't even be bothered to do that in a 2er game, let alone 3-4er (I imagine)! The mystery tile is a nice touch, but it sure can hurt you when you get stuck with a pair! I also like the throwing out of pairs ... great idea! 

I _might_ like this more if you saw a higher fraction of the tiles, but with so many remaining out of the game (in a 2er you'll see about 25/40?) it just feels a bit too random. Or maybe if people's collections were face up (except the hidden tile purchases) so you wouldn't have to bother trying to remember anything? Yeah, I might try this again with one or both of those changes ....

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
Shuffle tiles face down (remove 0-4 types of animals, 5 tiles each, depending on player count). Dealer each player 3; they choose 1 to keep, and place the others face up in the center. Add face up tiles to the center, plus 1 face down, till there are 8 tiles (2er game) in one group. Start with 1 food token each.

On your turn, either:
- split a group in two (any way you like, but at least 1 tile in each group) and take a food token (max 5; if you're already at 5, go to 4 instead of 6!)
-- OR --
- claim a group by spending 1 food/tile. If you have 10+ tiles, finish the round; then the game ends.

At the end of the round, add tiles to any remaining on the table to again create a single group of 8 (one face down).

At the end of the game, throw out any pairs you've collected; then discard down to max of 10 tiles (no pairs).
• Score VP for each species:
- any single tiles are worth face value (1-5)
- any groups (3-5 tiles of that species) are worth 5VP per tile
• Score 1VP per remaining food token.
• Most VP wins.

Fun family weight set collection game.  The little bit of added strategy added by the "I split, you choose" mechanism causes this game to stand out from other set collection games of the same weight.  The component quality and art work are top notch.

tl;dr: fine family game

Split a set of animals, or buy a set of animals. The trick is that you only get money by splitting, so you have to split enough before you can afford to buy, but that might give other players the chance to buy the set you want... or divide it further.
Scoring is done for sets of animals. Bigger sets score more. But sets of 2 don't score at all.
So yeah, simple rules but tricky game play that works great with families but that has enough to keep a gamer's interest.

Light-hearted dickery. Exactly what you want in your family games.

Two choices: split or buy. Score for singles or triplets plus. A really brilliantly pared down design.

A fairly simple game with an "I split, you choose" mechanic.  It's set collection where you want groups of 3+, but having 2 is worse than having just 1.  So, there are some decent choices of which animals you want to pick up.

It's basically a filler.  I could see playing it with kids maybe, but nothing about the game play draws me back.

Impressions after one play are positive. This is an elegant "I split, you choose" game that plays in under 30 minutes. Simple, fast, easy to explain. No real complaints here.

[b]Player Count Verdict: 3-4[/b]
The game just wouldn't work very well with two players. You need more players splitting up the animals, as this causes more uncertainty as to what will happen by the time your next turn comes around. With two players luck would be a much bigger factor.

I like this game its simple and different, unfortunately it hasn't been it hit with anyone in my family/game group.  I haven't anyone dislike it but nobody really wants to play it.  Kind of a force on my part but for now I'm hoping it will win them over.  It stays in my collection for now.

6-12-2016: Light matching game, where you sort animals before taking them.  Pairs don't count, and animals with 1 or 3 pairs are added up to score the game.  Not worth a buy but it wouldn't hurt to try this one at some point.

Very easy to learn and play and this game could easily of been done with just a pack of cards, but i appreciate the nice animal tiles and arks. This isn't a deeply strategic game but has good decisions to make in a very quick playtime. I Recommended this for families especially, but still great for medium weight gamer's like myself who want something to cap an evening off with.

A very quick game that feels closest in design to Mammut from Queen Games and a related cousin to the "a-pick-you-choose" games such as Piece of Cake. Basically, during your turn, you either split one pile of animals in the center and taking a crate of food or you pay with food crates to purchase one of the animal groups. After that, it is a set collection game to score points with pairs of animals being discarded while animal herds of 3 or more scoring 5 points each. Single animals are scored based on their printed values.

The game feels a little short and will end as soon as one person picks up 10 animals. If you wait to collect the perfect set, you may not have a lot of animals in your ark. Conversely, if you rush your collection, you may not be able to maximize the value of your animal collection. This is basically the push and pull of this game.

Animals on Board is cute, fun and family friendly. There are enough decisions to be made in this game but overall, luck of the split and draw still rule the day. Playing with open information may actually be helpful. Mammut is a better game overall in someways as it is slightly more complex.

A note on the components. While they are sturdy and solid, the pieces are not always functional. The flag to put on the ark is quite useless. Also, the ark has two rows. Once the top row is filled, there is no way to see the second row. Consequently, you have to constantly ask players how many animals they have in their ark. Rather annoying.

A simple set collection game. The mechanism of dividing the common pool of tiles into smaller groups, which changes the pricing of each group, is pretty clever. The game as a whole doesn't evoke any sense of satisfaction though, I don't think I would want to go back to this one. I'm not the target for this game, it's better suited for kids and beginners.

Family tile draft set collection variant of I slice you choose. Collect combinations of animals into your player ark for end game scoring.  The ark trays conceal your drafted tiles. Hidden information aspect with face down tile and starting player tile.  Elegant and clever system of gaining food to split a group of animals into another group or paying food to take a group. Unusual scoring system to toss out pairs and keep uniques, and big points for sets greater than a pair.  The splitting action is fun and makes you want to play again.  Do you put all the tiles you want in one group hoping they are not taken or split them up so you get at least something you want.

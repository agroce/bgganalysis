I love the way the scoring system reflected a solid theme of how your city would be.
But it was significantly more of a brain burner than it seemed from the rules description. A very much points optimisation exercise.

RATING: 4
Interesting drafting mechanism that reminds me of El Grande in that it's a two stage puzzle; first you have to pick the tile by counting over, and then you're bound to place it by what number you used to acquire it. Relatively solitary and passive in it's interaction, it plays better at 4 than 3 (the two counts I've tried) due to how tight the acquisition incentives are at 4. It's a fast game that is visually rather attractive, but ultimately not much meat to eat. I'd be willing to play it a few more times, but I don't think I'd buy it.

After 4 times playing 2 player and 1 time 4 player, I like it 4 the best, 2 works, but for my partner too much AP for me when playing 2 player (he thinks it's meh)
For trade because I mostly only play 2 player, yet only willing to ship this heavy game for Wishlist item 1 games. (I enjoy 4 player anyway so if it doesn't trade oh well)

[I]tl;dr - Fun and light city-building in under an hour makes this one a real keeper for me. The puzzle doesn't stay super-engaging after about a dozen plays, but it's still a fun one to break out every once in a while.[/I]
[COLOR=#CCCCFF]____________________________[/COLOR]

Quadropolis is a fun tile-layer with a spatial challenge where the engineer you use limits where you can place a specific tile. It's fun, but maybe a little bit samey? Still an entertaining puzzle overall. Not very conflict-heavy, everyone is just doing their own thing, though hell hath no fury like someone who's been blocked or lost the tile they were planning to take.

Expert mode adds a lot to this game. The ability to pick from a common pool of architects makes the game both harder and easier, in different aspects. Monuments and skyscrapers are fun additions to the game and introduce new strategies. Skyscrapers are powerful enough that they're difficult to ignore. Monuments will let a player run away with the game if one player gets more than a few, so they force other players to compete for that strategy. 

This is a good game when you hit it about once a month, but anything more than that and you get locked into the same strategy game after game. The board redeems this game, making it possible for skilled opponents to mess with you and take the tiles you really need. Still, once I hit 100 points I was much less interested in trying to improve my score and do better, so I'm downgrading this to a high six for now.

RATING: 7
1st play: Light, simple game, with enough variety to sustain 3-4 plays before it's fair to say that you've tried the gamut of strategies. All of the actions are worth about the same points and the city building rules are abstract enough to just be a mechanic rather than thematic.

2nd play: Played on the expert mode this time, and it's a lot better. More flexibility in tile choices and additional scoring methods based on layouts, combined with a bigger board and unique monuments make this a more complete experience. I'm still not sure the game has 50 plays in it, but it's considerably better one expert and the only way I'll play it from now on.

Quite a good little city building game.  There is plenty of scope for planning ahead here and picking a good strategy may be rewarded when scoring your city.  It will probably take a few plays to appreciate the synergy between different buildings and how the score at the end of the game.  Saying that it is quite easy to set up and get playing.

Another solid game with solid production from Days of Wonder. What a beautiful game and a beautiful treat. Only played it two players and it was a blast. Game time flies by and offers some good strategizing. Definitely a grand addition to our ever-growing collection of board games. Also, the insert is amazing!!! Every piece fits perfectly in its place. Bonus points to Days of Wonder for designing such a perfect insert! I was so happy when I opened the box.

RATING: 6
Quadropolis is everything you have learned to expect of a Days of Wonder game: a solid, well developed design, excellent components, vivid, family-friendly artwork, but not much meat for a hardcore gamer to chew on.  In many ways it is a typical city builder, with tiles representing the usual building types being placed on a grid and different ways of scoring each type.  What novelty there is lies in the means of selecting tiles from a central tableau using "architects" with varying degrees of reach.  The expert game adds a couple more building types, but it is essentially more of the same rather than a step up in complexity.    Quadropolis plays quickly and is easily digested.

A pleasant city building game with nice components and a great box insert, with a decent "choose tiles in a matrix" and "place tiles on a matrix" mechanic with numbered pointers, that feels pleasantly spatial and wonky, but for me, lacks gaming magic or reason to be enthusiastic about playing again. 

I just didn't find anything in the game really exciting, funny or truly desirable to want, and the interactions between the players in the game were very cursory to nonexistent.  Still, a very polished design, and basically pleasant.

Have only played once so far with "classic" mode which was too light and simple to really keep me interested. I can see where things would get more strategic in the "expert" version but the lack luster classic mode has somewhat put me off of wanting to play the game again in any mode.

Interesting little city builder.  Not a ton of interaction with other players, just the occasional "oh you went where I wanted to go", but it doesn't happen often.

A great city builder here, with a tight tile drafting mechanic that converts into some strategic scoring opportunities based on your personal board placement. The components and artwork are lovely, which I suppose is par for the course for Days of Wonder, but why I value it the most is that it hits that medium-Euro area of simplistic game mechanics that translate into riskier, heavy strategies.

RATING: 3
I get this is has to be compatible with families. But hell, then do not make it an abstract attempt at getting Victory points that has not the slightest thematical connection to anything that's city building. The mechanics are a fun idea, but they are used in the wrong game and not developed enough. Also, no kid needs these terribly candy-colored illustrations that just remind me of bad mobile games. 

Just because it's a family game it does not have to be bad if you play it as a grumpy adult. :P

Quadropolis is another in a long line of city-builders that tries to capture the magic of sim city and smoosh it into cardboard.  I like resource management of the game as far as juggling energy and meeples (you often need both but should always avoid having a surplus of either).  The tried and true idea of placing specific types of buildings next to others for points is nice (and almost expected now in these games).

What I found sort of dull, was the whole system by which you acquire tiles and the mechanics for where you get to place them on your board.  I'm told it's a bit like '5 tribes' which I haven't played.  It's pretty abstract (which doesn't really bother me), and very puzzle-like (which I often really enjoy in other games) but the whole thing ended up feeling tedious to me.

This hits exactly the kind of light puzzle I like.  You need to get buildings from a matrix to put them in your own matrix (city), but the rules to take and place are tricky, since you get the buildings with a numbered architect, and this number forces you to get only some buildings and restricts location places.
Buildings themselves score in different ways, and this gives you several ways to get good choices.  Although visually is not special, the mechanics work quite fine for me, I really enjoyed the game.

Quadropolis is a cute lightweight game, boosted by the usual awesome production value of Days of Wonder (it has also one of the best inserts ever seen).

Each turn, players use one of their architects to acquire a tile, and the value of the architect determines both the position from which the tile can be taken (from a central 5x5 board) and the position of its placement (in the player's own board).

After 4 rounds (or 5 in the expert game), each player scores points for its city, with various bonuses for buildings configurations.

The classic game is quite a gateway game, while the expert version has a bit more meat (with common architects, and more types of buildings), even if it has almost the same rules.

Quadropolis is not a super exciting game, perhaps, but it is a quite solid design, and a very enjoyable short euro.

Good "gateway" weight game that offers some interesting choices for the more experienced gamer. I prefer a little more crunch in my strategy games, so a game like Capital gets more play as a light to medium weight city-builder, unless some of the extended family is around. I do think Quadropolis will have more longevity than the average "gateway" weight game.

I bought this on a whim because it's a Days of Wonder annual game release. The game is actually rather good and same goes for the components. However, the cartoonish artwork doesn't appeal to me. The biggest problem I have with this game is that it's not particularly exciting or memorable for a city-building tile placement game. With the same amount of game time, I will always choose another game over this in the similar genre like Suburbia or Between Two Cities. This will be a good first gateway city-building game for new gamers though.

3 player game, 1st time played for all of us. I pulled out a close win over Sander and Jeremy. This was super easy to learn on the fly for all of us. It gives tough decisions with many different ways to score. All of the buildings have the potential to offer up big points. However, you can't really go for all types. I went for a factory/shop strategy. Sander went strong in harbors and Jeremy had parks next to apartments. We will definitely play the Advanced game next time.

Great city building game that pares the mechanics of SimCity down to a few easy to understand tiles that work together in a very balanced way. You get to build your city how you want- there are enough different combinations that you can complete very decently with another player while building a very different looking city. The mechanic using different valued builders to draft tiles also provides a very fun, competitive challenge. Days of Wonder does it again!

Bought this at PAX East 2017 after Allan and I demo'd it at the Asmodee booth. I think it'll be a good one to play with more casual players and also to play the advanced version. I love how different all the cities turn out and how close the scores were (we all had huge points in a category or two and decent ones in others). Great game!

Update: I love this game. I've played now on both Expert and Classic modes and I genuinely enjoy both. I kove how accessable the game is and everyone I've taught enjoys it. I'm decent at playing and I'll usually score well, which is always a plus. I love planning out my city and making placements that have multiple benefits.

We played this prototype at BGG con, and it was one of the better new games we tried. Simple scoring system, interesting way in which tiles are acquired and placed. Replayability a bit questionable in my eyes, but I guess it all depends on how extensive the set of advanced tiles and/or rules eventually are.

This game feels very simcity-ish to me and that's a good thing. I skipped the basic mode and went straight to the expert mode and that seemed like the right call with my gaming group. We were a big fan of numbers running out and the blocking feeling way more prevalent.

Quuadropolis hits that sweet spot of incredibly simple rules, but interesting game play with difficult decisions.

On your turn, you simply select a tile from a grid of tile, following some rules for selecting a tile.  Your selection will limit what the player after you can do, as well as where in your city you can place the tile.  As the round continues, your best laid plans will probably be foiled, as you options become more and more limited, both in terms of what tiles are available and where you can place them in your city.

Buildings also either provide or require the resources of either people or fuel, which you'll need to have in balance by the end of the game.

And the end of a few rounds, everyone scores their city.  Various building score in various ways.  You want your housing developments stacked high, your public works spread across your city, your shipyards in a line, your parks next to housing developments, etc.  Any buildings that weren't supplied with the required resources are lost, and conversely, any excess resources are negative points (representing unemployment and pollution).

Overall, a really solid effort!  One of those games where you'll probably decide on a strategy from the outset (and the strategies are numerous!), but will also have to be able to play a little tactically when inevitably you can't quite get everything you had wanted due to the actions of other players.

This is my favorite Days of Wonder game. As far as city building, I enjoy Suburbia more, but I find the scoring in Suburbia to be incredibly irritating since you have to do it every time you place a tile, and it interacts with itself, neighboring tiles, other tiles in your suburb, and other tiles in other people's suburb. Basically I like it best at 1 or 2 players. Quadropolis streamlines the entire system. Don't bother with the classic version, jump straight to the Expert version, and boy did it scratch my brain in a good way, without taking 20 minutes to explain. Loved it. Glad it's in my collection.

RATING: 6
Interesting, but very light game. The expert mode is the only mode you want to play though, as the classic version is 100% multiplayer solitaire. 
One thing I am missing a bit is a better mechanism to limit the choices of the other players. We played this game a few times with 2 and 4 players and per round, you can (and you have to be lucky for this) only block certain tiles for a given player once or twice, as otherwise there will be other means to get the same or a minimally worse tile. Usually, blocking other players means non-optimal play, so the gain does not (or very rarely) outweigh the benefits.
Still, it is a nice game, but upkeep during stages is annoying and somehow we ended up selling the game after 10 plays. Full disclosure: We were debating if we wanted to keep it or not, but we also thought that "variability" is limited and we wont get that many additional enjoyable plays out of the game.

this game was fun, but just seemed so much like so many other games.  Particularly between two cities.  Blue tile gets points for tiles in a line.  Green tile gets points if there are yellow tiles next to it.  Yellow tile gets points if you stack them up. Etc.

When I first played this game we ended up playing it 5 times in a row and that has never happened with any game I own. 4 of those times we played the classic version and the 5th was the expert. The classic version was challenging but not too hard to where this couldn't be a gateway game any more. This could easily entertain anyone who enjoys the city building types of games. 

On the expert side, it brought in a lot of different challenges and strategies that you don't normally have. There was a lot more time for analysis paralysis especially since you can't predict what someone is going to do as easily since you share the pool of architects. Since it's more unpredictable, and the game has a lot of randomness itself you can't really plan ahead. If you do, you have to think of many different routes in case the others don't end up working. 

Overall, I really enjoyed playing Quadropolis. The art is really great and is easy to visually understand. It playes very fast around 45 minutes on the classic side so it can be a good filler game or a bit over an hour when playing the expert. I feel like I could find a lot of different times to get this game to the table and would enjoy playing it every time.

Components: Clear iconography and player aids.Fun art, with several slightly different variations on the art for some tile types.

Experience: Every tile is useful, but there's not enough time, so players have to be very choosy. The architect method of selecting and placing a tile is a weird, arbitrary restriction, but it works. It's fun to build out my city, but toward the end there is a lot of minmaxing.

After a quick demo at Origins 2016, played a full 4 player game in the board room.  I was frustrated with how limited your moves are in this game.  And you really can't plan much ahead because the board fills up with other players markers so quickly.  This game is not really for me, but is quick to play, so I could be convinced occasionally.  Maybe a 2 or 3 player game would be better.  Since you cannot play an Architect in the same location as a previous player, there would be many more open spots in a 2 or 3 player game.

Quadropolis is in a really interesting spot in that it is gateway weight, but still really satisfying to play and very replayable.  It manages to have simple rules, to be very interactive, and to enable you to still build something (as opposed to many simple, interactive games that are just auctions).  There are some very difficult decisions to be made, especially as the game advances.  It rewards careful planning, but you can also go by instinct.  And that's just the Classic mode!  Expert is also enjoyable, but we haven't really explored it too much.  Everything I said about Classic seems to hold true, except it is just a touch harder to explain.

This seems like the definition of a Classic game to me.

Fun city-guiding game with fantastic components.

Rating has dropped for me as I've realised a flaw with the Expert game: if somebody decides to build towers (and somebody always will), at least one other player must also do so.  The tower bonuses are just too strong to let one person take them all.  With four players, that's annoying; with three players, it forces one of the not-tower players to sacrifice their gameplan to play spoiler.  This really seems to go against the gentle, do-your-own-thing nature of the game.

That's turned a game I really enjoyed and played five times in a couple of weeks into a game I haven't taken off the shelf for a while.

Simple rules that force tough decisions. Basically you pick a building tile and then place it on your own player mat to build your city.

It may like a multi player solo, but as all players draw from the same market, and taking into account the special rules to draw and lay a tile, there are more interactions than it first appears. With experience you can even play a bit more aggressively.

There  are many different way to build your city.
Planning your city is just one part of the game , you also have to make it runs efficiently, hence there is a resources management game tightly coupled with the tiles laying. For example you not only have to build new housing to attract new inhabitants to your city you also need jobs for them. 

The Classic game is approachable and meaty enough for most Euro gamers. Then you have the, appropriately named, Expert game. The nice thing is that it doesn't just add an extra layer to the Classic game, instead it change some of the fundamentals leading to a different and more strategic experience.

A mini-expansion "The Squares" is also included in the box.

All in all, it may lack a WoW factor, but a good surprise better than I expected from the game rules. Good replayability.

The usual high production values from DoW, but I found the game only ok. Building the city seemed to require choosing a plan and sticking with it, and then seeing if you executed yours better than others did there's. No need to think on your feet or adjust your plan, minimal ways to effect others. There are much better building games; this one is ok.

Score points by building your city on a 4 by 4 square. The tiles the players place are taken from a 5 by 5 square. The game is played over 4 rounds, with new tiles being laid out on the 5 by 5 square each round. The players select the tiles for their own board by means of arrows, marked 1 2 3 and 4, which have to be placed along the outside of the 5 by 5 square pointing at one particular row or column. The player can pick up the tile in that row that corresponds to the number on his arrow. Arrows cannot be put on top of another arrow, and every time a tile is picked, the row and column corresponding to this tile are blocked for the next player. On top of that, the player has to place the tile in a row or column on his 4 by 4 board which corresponds with the number on the arrow with which he has obtained the tile. The game looks simple, but in fact it's quite a puzzle, in which you can get blocked by your adversaries. Grmmbl.

Easy to learn city building game with a twist. I like the way there are restrictions as to what tiles you may or may not take, then that also determines where you may or may not place the tiles.

This game plays like a competitive version of Between Two Cities. The twist is that a tile will not score at the end unless, during the game, you acquire the piece needed to activate it; but, you're penalized if you acquire more of those pieces than you need. As in card games in which you predict the number of tricks you will take, you want to get enough pieces but not too many.

I really love city building games. Suburbia is one of my Top Ten games of all time, but I hated Subdivision, and was ambivalent regarding City Tycoon. I was nervous about this one - I mean, how much fun can putting tiles on a 4x4 grid be, right?  Boy, was I wrong.  This is an excellent game that i plan to enjoy for a long time.

GOOD: Excellent components.  Nice, very thick cardboard that has a great feel and is easy to handle.  
-Simple rules, but lots of depth and many paths to try.
- Good insert that holds everything nice and tight.
- Simple iconography that is very easy to grasp.
- Bright, colorful artwork that does not distract from the game.

BAD:  Nothing comes to mind.  This is a keeper.

A very pleasant and approachable family game.   It is essentially a drafting game with tile placement and different categories of scoring - so nothing terribly innovative, but it moves quickly and offers some interesting choices.   I wouldn't say "difficult choices" necessarily.   The two modes of play are both different enough to warrant playing.  I enjoy them both.   Of course the presentation and packaging are amazing.   That certainly helps the game.  (Extra Monument tiles thanks to Mary!)

This has quickly climbed the ranks and become one of my favorite board games to play.  It's lighter than suburbia and doesn't require as much micromanagement to make sure you remember all the different stat changes made when a tile is laid down.  However, it has a solid puzzle that, to me, is almost thinkier than suburbia's puzzle as you figure out the most efficient way to use your architects to get the right buildings in the right locations to maximize your points.

Quadropolis plays in 45 minutes and is timed perfectly. You select tiles from a shared grid and place them on your personal grid via a clever system. There are scoring opportunities dependent on the building type and where you place it.

This is multi-player solitaire for sure, despite the shared area of tile recruitment. And it is really an abstract puzzle.

Quadrpolis is just the right length. Any longer and it might get dull, but at 45 minutes it is a perfect quite meaty filler. And the components are terrific.

This game has escalated quickly into my favorites ones. It's a little confusing at the start because of all the kind of buildings and how they score, but when you understand (simply using the personal guide) and go for a strategy, the game shines; in addition, the Expert mode is great. It gives you better strategic elements. 

Great game for beginners to expert board game players.

RATING: 7.52
Fun and light city building brain burner with clever mechanic of selecting tile from the grid with one of the 4 arrow tiles numbered 1 to 4, and placing it on a column and/or row in your city grid that matches the selected arrow tile. There are 6 different city tiles that are scored differently, 2 different types of resources (people and waste) that are both provided by city tiles and needed for the city tiles to be activated in order to be scored. Unused resources are negative points. And everything is in number 4.

Seems like variations of Town Center.
The quality, design, player aid, and scoring system make it potentially more accessible  (We have read the Town Center instructions multiple times and it takes an effort to understand the benefits and effects of each building, and we like Town Center.)  Here the logic is relatively straightforward.
In addition to the core relative placement logic, Quadropolis layers on an architect selection method at the front end, and placement limitations on the board -- yet the game is still light enough (as those methods and limitations provide a bit of structure and hence the selection is not wide open and overwhelming).

Rating is for Classic mode. 

Need to try the expert mode. I want a little more from the resource planning. The selection mechanism for gaining new buildings is brilliant and really makes you think ahead. 

I'm really not a fan of how scoring is done with the pad of paper like in Five Tribes. I'd much rather have a score track around a slightly larger board. 

Components are fantastic really nice translucent plastics. The individual player boards are a very flimsy and disappointing paperboard.

Discovered this through the play-to-win section at Geekway 2017. Fun "sim city" type game. The spatial aspects of both the tile-claiming and tile-laying mechanics made this game feel different from other tile-laying games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Each player builds their own metropolis in Quadropolis (first announced as City Mania), but they're competing with one another for the shops, parks, public services and other structures to be placed in them.

The game lasts four rounds, and in each round players first lay out tiles for the appropriate round at random on a 5x5 grid. Each player has four architects numbered 1-4 and on a turn, a player places an architect next to a row or column in the grid, claims the tile that's as far in as the number of the architect placed (e.g., the fourth tile in for architect #4), places that tile in the appropriately numbered row or column on the player's 4x4 city board, then claims any resources associated with the tile (inhabitants or energy).

When a player takes a tile, a figure is placed in this now-empty space and the next player cannot place an architect in the same row or column where this tile was located. In addition, you can't place one architect on top of another, so each placement cuts off play options for you and everyone else later in the round. After all players have placed all four architects, the round ends, all remaining tiles are removed, and the tiles for the next round laid out.

After four rounds, the game ends. Players can move the inhabitants and energy among their tiles at any point during the game to see how to maximize their score. At game end, they then score for each of the six types of buildings depending on how well they build their city — as long as they have activated the buildings with inhabitants or energy as required:

- Residential buildings score depending on their height
- Shops score depending on how many customers they have
- Public services score depending on the number of districts in your city that have them
- Parks score depending on the number of residential buildings next to them
- Harbors score based on the longest row or column of activated harbors in the city
- Factories score based on the number of adjacent shops and harbors

Some buildings are worth victory points (VPs) on their own, and once players sum these values with what they've scored for each type of building in their city, whoever has the highest score wins.

I think this is an enjoyable tile placement game, and every game I play seems very close... but I'm not sure if that's good or bad. On one hand, I sort of feel like no matter what you do you're gonna get points and it'll be close, but on the other hand, I feel like it's good that the games are close.

I guess I need more plays to decide for sure.

I love, love, love:
- the colors and quality printed and clear components
- the two modes of play
- the multiple ways to victory
- the two-level thinking and planning
- the twist on stacking certain buildings, too, not just laying them in a grid
- also having to manage meeples and energy units

I dislike:
- having to keep the punchboards in order to not have pieces falling out of the insert; this could've been planned better, I'm sure

Final verdict: Great primarily tile-placing game that's probably currently my favorite. I love that it's not just about the right tile-placement in rows or columns but also about maintaining balance between people and energy (and having a place for each to go at the end of the game) and tile-placing upward as well. The components quality is stellar, as is typical of Days of Wonder, and the insert is nice as well.

Ohhh I really really like this one.

The architects and overseer interaction on the buildings board is very unique and I really really like it.
I love that tile placement within your city also depends upon which architect you used to claim said city tile and thus forces some carefully considered play.

Its is fairly abstract and once placed the tiles are fairly generic scoring points in a variety of different ways, but I don't care because that building board tile selection part of the game is fantastic.

Nagyon tetszett már a szabály alapján is, és játszva is. Nagyon szeretem az ilyen jellegű játékokat, ahol egy döntésslel több dolog függ össze. Érdekes a pontozása is, pont jó a játékidő, pörgős. Egy kilencéves is simán játssza, de közben a felnőtteknek is van benne kihívás. Kicsit szoliter olyan szempontból, hogy szándékosan nem igazán tudod befolyásolni a többiek dolgát, illetve nem is nagyon érdemes figyelni őket, ugyanakkor a lépésid mégis hatással vannak rájuk, nagyon is. Mindenképp érdekel az expert verzió is, de az alappal is szívesen eljátszanék még. Mehet még feljebb ez a pont.

RATING: 5
There is no shortage of city building games but I have yet to find one that recreates that Sim City feeling of the olden times. Quadopolis isn't that game, either, because it abstracts away so many of the crucial decisions when building a city and turns it into a set collection game with a spatial component.

The big problem with many of the city building games - and if you think about it, a problem inherent to the theme if you let everyone build their own city - is lack of interaction. Each player putters about in their private area, and if paths ever cross with the other players at all it is often through some forced bottleneck that typically doesn't have anything to do with the actual task of building a city.

Quadropolis fits that scheme very well, with the only interaction point being the selection of buildings from a shared board, and while that selection (and tile denial) can be quite crucial towards the end of the game any screwage or otherwise mostly seems accidental before that point.

Früh wie kaum ein zweiter Verlag hatte man bei Days of Wonder verstanden wie sehr Ausstattungsqualität und visuelle Atmosphäre eines Spiels für dessen automatisches Upgrade sorgt. Days of Wonder ist Wundermaterial. In dieser Hinsicht macht der Verlag seinem Namen alle Ehre. So auch in QUADROPOLIS, einem klassischen Städtebauspiel, das dem Genre ein gemessen am Spieldesign konventionelles Exemplar hinzufügt: Häuser nach einem netten Mechanismus (Experten-Variante) aus der Auslage nehmen und auf dem quadratischen Stadtplan verbauen. So lebt auch QUADROROPOLIS von seiner Haptik, seiner grandiosen Sinnlichkeit, seinem famosen Look. Darüber hinaus spielt es sich elegant, konstruktiv und ohne negative Eigenschaften. Ein wenig mehr Peripherie und Kante im Verlagsprogramm würde Days of Wonder dem Mainstream ein wenig entkommen lassen, aber ein Verlagskonzept, indem sich Wunder über Materialerlebnis definiert, will vermutlich auch gar nicht mehr sein als dies.

First of all, I love city building games. second of all, I love Days of Wonder games. So, this really seemed like a safe bet for me. I was initially hesitant to pick this up since I am a huge Suburbia fan, and I didnt think I needed another city building game in my collection. However, as I did more research on it, I realized it was probably different enough to justify picking it up. Right indeed...Its really more of a solitaire experience with your own player cards in front of you, taking turns placing tiles into your city. The classic version is great for learning and lighter game play, the expert version isnt all that complicated...just adds a little more flavor is all.  I personally rate this a 7, because while I think its good...I just dont think its amazing. I dont prefer how little player interaction there is. However, if it were up to my husband, he would probably rate this an 8 or 8.5...he was really taken by this little game, and always suggests we play it.


Edit: Now that we have gotten comfortable with the expert mode, this game has really come to life. Honestly, its a shame that this game doesnt have more attention.

Fast and light city building game with an interesting mechanic. But unfortunatly fails to deliver on the theme and feels a bit empty and incomplete (like it's missing more building and strategical options).

After one play on the "classic" mode, everyone I played with had a great time. My wife commented how much she liked the game. If only the classic mode were in the box, I would consider it a must buy family game, and the expert mode is likely to increase my opinion even further. 

Update: Have played about half a dozen times now, all classic mode. This is an excellent game that has a chance of becoming a modern classic. Turns are super quick and almost breezy, yet if you really want to, you can burn your brain on this one.

This game is perfect for the audience and the situation it is intended for. It can be taught in 10 minutes and played in 45-60. It's interesting and has a bit of depth to it. On my first play, I lost the game because my last architect was not able to place a tile in my city because all the #4 spots were filled. So you do have to have a bit of advanced planning. It's a really nice, great looking, fun to play game that hits a lot of high points with a lot of different types of gamers.

Maybe I played one too many multi-axis gateway Euros the day I played this, but this one bored me to death. Houses score more the more you get in one place. Ports want to be in straight lines. Factories are only worth anything if they're next to... zzz.

Even the restriction of picking a tile and location that match your architect tile seems more like a device to limit the search space for players, not a way to force hard decisions.

RATING: 7.5
This is a really fun and exciting game for both casual and serious gamers. Choosing a strategy and trying to follow it to the end, while at the same time managing which architects are remaining, and which areas are still available on your grid will keep you focused from start to end.

There are optimum solutions; however, if you really want to enjoy then it is best to find these out yourselves. At the start we thought we had the optimal layout but later found out better ones. Once you determine these, then you can go a bit deeper and try to block your opponent from getting these tiles. Being the mayor will become quite an important advantage!

Overall, i think this is a very underrated game; I've seen a lot of copies in many stores. Try it out; I think you won't be disappointed.

Not my kind of game, too light to my taste. But it is simple to learn and play. Aside from the setup, there is no randomness in the game, if things go wrong, well it is your fault... or the neighbour's. hehe!

If I owned this game I would put it beside my Carcassonne and cannibalize it for parts for my prototypes since I have condemned my Carcassonne because I have no fun with this game anymore albeit being a good one.

I would only recommend this game if you like light casual city-themed games. I can't call this city building because it could just have been farming fields with water and workers, or something else. But it is enjoyable and that is why I gave it a 6 like my Carcassonne.

Have played this twice and looking forward to playing it again.  Have not played the Expert level of the game yet.

The thing I love about this game is that there it's a little bit thinky but also very welcoming to newer players.  The classic version of the game plays very quickly which is another bonus.  This is a game that reminds me of a gateway game with the simplicity of the rules, but also gives gamers a bit of a puzzle. The puzzle is constantly changing so even if you figure out what type of city you like to build your strategy will need to constantly be changing from game to game due to random tile set up. 

Wrap it all up in a game that plays in under an hour and you have a game that should easily make my top 10 games of 2016 (and maybe even of all time).

Very abstract city-building game.  AP inducing.  Suburbia did it better.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
At first you think suburbia light, but it's more than that. The engineers, placement rules meeples/power are all a really nice touch and they make you think. The scoring is nice too

But suburbia tied it all together much better than this does. In suburbia the cities are more freeform and the adjacency points scoring for suburbia makes more thematic sense than this.

Conclusion is that I suburbia you feel like you're designing a city. Whereas in this you know you're playing a game and trying to manage resources to score points, while the theme seems less important

Neutral - on occasion.

4p has much more fun than 2p.

Quadropolis has very few rules, but the pay is that buildings are kind of plain: the buildings for 1st round are almost identical to that for 4th/5th round. In contrast, [thing=123260][/thing] has clear level designs on the functions of buildings, creating a good climax, while the game is much more complex overall. 

It's a matter of taste. I personally like [thing=123260][/thing] more.

This game was pretty good, but definitely not anything to get too excited about. First of all, if you have any experience playing games you can pretty safely start with the full version of the game. The evaluations weren't all that hard, everything scores in a fairly standard way. On paper I liked how the thing you used to take the tile also determined where you could put it, but in practice it really just made the decisions easier because there were fewer tiles that would actually work for you. But it was reasonably fun going through the motions and seeing your city develop.

The game comes with two modes, "classic" and "expert". They both play pretty much the same mechanically, except that the expert version has an extra round, a few extra building types, and a more complicated player board. Depending on the version, the game is played in 4 or 5 rounds. Each round a 5x5 grid of city tiles are laid out. Players play architects numbered 1-4 to draft tiles. When your 4 architects are used the round finishes. The trick for drafting is that you need to place your architect at the end of a row or column and then you take the tile corresponding to the number of your architect, so 1-4 (or 5 for expert) spaces into the row or column from your architect. Then you also need to place the tile on a space on your player board that also corresponds to the number on the architect you used. Each tile may also give you people or energy that you need to activate your tiles for scoring at the end of the game. Activated tiles score depending on tile type and the scoring rules for that type. Most points on activated tiles wins the game.

Rather simple rules. Very abstract game. As tiles get taken and available architect spots get used up, it gets increasingly difficult to secure the tiles you want. It is also interesting that collecting resources is tied also to the drafting, so you need to think about drafting for both resources and placement.

It's a decent game, but I'm not sure that it's special enough to warrant a lot of plays.

RATING: 6
Es una especie de filler city-building, un euro ligero-medio. No tienes que preocuparte del aspecto económico, las dos únicas monedas del juego son los habitantes y la energía, y la manera de usarlas es tratando de conseguir tanto de cada uno de estos dos recursos como pidan los edificios en tu ciudad, si te quedas corto no activas los edificios, y si te pasas te penalizan.

Las reglas de colocación son sencillas, pero entorpecen mucho a la hora de desarrollar la ciudad, no haces lo que quieres, sino lo que te dejan. El tener que colocar en tu cuadrícula sólo en la fila o columna igual al número de arquitecto que has usado es un poco limitante. Entiendo que sino fuera así, sería mucho más fácil hacer los combos, pero aún así es muy restrictivo.

Por lo demás, el juego es fácil de jugar y se entiende fácilmente, la mecánica es muy sencilla. Visualmente es un juego muy bonito, y tiene pinta de ser carne de expansión.

Very difficult to rate. I really like the mechanics and it's a good looking game with nice components. This type of games I prefer to play with only two players and in this case there seemed to be one really strong strategy both in the family and expert version. Having more players would probably remove this as it depends on how the other players do but then again, I prefer to play with two.

RATING: 5
The game is very abstract. There is a square grid (5x5) of tiles (buildings). On your turn you choose 1 character, which has a number from 1-5, from a limited supply and place it in an unoccupied spot on the edge of the 5x5 grid. You then take a building tile depending on the number of the character. You grab the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc... tile according to the number of your character.

The claimed tile is placed on a personal board according to some arbitrary constraints. There are lots of different types of buildings and each one scores differently, think [thing=123260][/thing] or [thing=168435][/thing]. The round ends after some number of turns, then the grid is refilled and character tiles returned to the supply. The game is played over 5 rounds.

[b]Engagement[/b]
I don't find the game to be very engaging. The scoring system is too over bearing and convoluted. Each turn you have many options and it feels like a chore to calculate the value of each and weigh options. You don't have enough control of the future to really determine the proper value of anything. 

It's also odd that as you collect a type of tile they become more valuable. It's a common mechanism, but since players are drafting these tiles it means that there is less tension since player's interests don't overlap. The scoring system does a bit to try and mix this up, but not enough.

The game is fast and ultimately light, but gives the illusion of being deeper than it is. I can see why people like this game, but it isn't for me.

RATING: 7
Four rounds, four workers per player each round, each worker can take one tile per turn to fill up players' 4x4 grids in the base game. The task is to compose the city in a way that best utilizes the scoring rules for the various building types. The box also includes an expert variant which I haven't played yet.

Another very enjoyable title from Days of Wonder. Manageable rules without any bloat, a simple base structure of each turn, family-friendly gameplay but not inconsequential. Although I had the impression that certain buildings are stronger, I trust DoW enough that they have balanced this thing well. Anyway, we will not have to wait long for expansions in the form of new buildings.

Here's another one of those almost solitaire-ish grid puzzle games that I just love.  It can be a little fiddly dealing with the many tiles, especially if you follow the "lay them out one by one" rule (which we do not see the point of following).  The tiles are incredibly thick, while the player mats are almost too thin.  The two variants offer something for everyone.  It plays relatively fast, you will tend to have that feeling of wanting "just one more" architect to get just one more tile.  I really like Quadropolis.

RATING: 7.5
The central mechanism of the Architects limiting both selection and placement is very cool. The game contains two versions (called Classic and Expert), but they're not simply a more complex version of the other: they each have their strengths. Classic is more about blocking one another, almost worker-placement-y in its feel of quickly diminishing options; Expert is more about the optimization of your personal board. In the end, I wish there was a way to have the strengths of both in the same game, as they don't seem mutually exclusive: that would push it up to a 9.

Note: only played the classic game so far. I've heard Expert is a lot more fun but the guy teaching Quardopolis wanted to play on Classic.

Pretty simple but decent tile laying game. Very solitary though. I tried blocking off some obvious tiles that others were gunning for. However, doing so would always cost me more points than I'd deny the opponent!
Bleh.

Nice components though. A bit too fiddly for setup and teardown though.

I prefer Suburbia. It also ends up creating better stories. After our game of Quadropolis was finished there was one city that seemed to be nicely themed but the other ones were obviously point-oriented and honestly just quite a mess.

Closing seems very close though. Nearly had a three way tie :p
I do like that, keeps it exciting. Every action feels like it counts.

This is a really satisfying puzzle. The main board is there but most of the time you get what you want if you are not competing with another player for a specific tile type. But the most important part of the game is placing those tiles. The number you take the tile has a lot of importance. You might see a perfect tile but if you can't take it with the number you want to place it with maybe it is not the best tile for you. I also like the less is more kind of approach of the game with resources. If you take more than what you need, you are going to lose points on them. I really like the look of cities after the game is finished. This is a wonderful game without the expert part of it and I can't wait to try the expert variant which I think will be even better.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Always, good quick fun - just don't know if it has staying power. Disappointed that the first player token can be hogged by one player, which really jeopardizes the available options for the last player (who is only last because of where he happens to be sitting due to the clockwise rotating turn order). Also, the urbanist, whilst a cool mechanism in theory, never results in much blocking. In 90% of cases you will still be able to get a tile that benefits your overall strategy, especially in the Expert mode where the architect numbers are more freely available.

Maybe starting with the Expert was not a good choice.

RATING: 7
I've only ever played this game with 2 though we may play it soon with our 8 year old son.  I say that because much of why we like the game has to do with how quickly it plays with 2.  We skip the bag for tile draws because it adds too much time.  I instead mix them all face down and make a stack then have someone else pick a row or column and just start placing (flipping any tiles that should be for 2 player then and there).

The mechanic for picking and placing tiles is very bad thematically but so clever from that abstract sense that the game becomes as much about that as it does the city building/scoring itself.  It's really pretty light for just the basic game.  We haven't yet tried the expert rules and tiles as it's already a keeper as-is.  Likely that should tip the scales even more as the basic game feels like it could use just one more layer of strategy/complexity to achieve perfection.

Carson City is still my favorite game with City Building in it though this is a nice lighter alternative for sure.

Quadropolis has simple rules but it can be quite thinky if you start thinking of long-term plans (and this is a must if you want to win). Though, I would have liked that the "expert" mode was a little more complicated. It actually seemed even easier than Classic to me because it wasn't so thight (at least with 2 players). 

I'm not a fan of the cartoony art but the components are of good quality (love the glass-like meeples!). All in all, it's a neat gateway game that I am happy to have in my collection (for playing with family etc.).

Lightweight game for the whole family which doesn't take that much time to play. Easy to teach, but lacks a little bit fun.

Scoring could be a bit more streamlined too or the helpsheet and tiles more informative.

A lightish city builder with points for adjacency and such.  I put this is the same basket as Suburbia, Capitals & Capital.  This being said, Quadropolis is by far the lightest of the lot and very near to being family level accessible.  Play is light and balanced almost to a fault.  Game are generally won by a few points and almost accidentally.  The tile mechanism grabbing is new, interesting but not particularly deep and mostly tactical.  Production value is nice with the insert being exceptionally good.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Solid first impression as a relatively smooth and fast playing spatial puzzle. We played using the expert rules. (However, the base rules might actually create a more challenging experience?) The selection mechanic using architects to claim a building off a row/column thereby reducing options for future was interesting although I'm uncertain if we spent much time thinking about how to interfere with each other here as three of us were new. There were times that we were "frustrated" when the necessary architect was no longer available or a row/column was no longer available. I enjoyed the puzzle aspect of developing one's city - I'd recommend focusing on a couple scoring routes as I don't see diversity being successful for scoring purposes. Looking forward to more plays in the future! As well, there was the added "complexity" of managing workers and energy - which are needed for certain buildings to score them at the end of the game - however, extras are negative points at the end of the game.

RATING: 8
Quadropolis is another great game from Days of Wonder. It looks fantastic, plays simple and elegantly, works great as a gateway game but has enough depth to satisfy more experienced gamers. Playtime is about 10 to 15 minutes per player. 

A turn in this game is very simple. Use one of the architects to grab a building tile from the central board. The architect's number (1 through 5) tells you how many spaces away from the side you've placed your architect on you can grab a tile. And once you've grabbed that building tile you have to place it on your player board in the column or row with that same number. An easy to understand rule, but when you're playing the game you'll find out that it sounds a lot easier than it is.

Sometimes you'll see a building your desperately want but you can't get it because the spaces on the sides are blocked. Sometimes you can grab the tile you want, but can't fit in on your player board with that number. Sometimes you're faced with seemingly impossible dilemma's because you can make two great turns with one architect. It's these meaty decisions you're confronted with that make this game such a fantastic experience. 

I fell in love with Quadropolis during the first play and can't wait to introduce this game to other players. Definitely a keeper.

[microbadge=5]

Quadropolis really nails the city building genre for me.  All of the little quirks that I want for this theme are here: buildings that act differently, resources to properly utilize, and spacial relevance for building placement.  The architect mechanic is pretty game-y and un-thematic, but I can live with that since it plays so well.  Probably my favorite part of the game is the building scoring.  They are by and large all unique (apart from factories and parks) but still intuitive and thematic (always a plus if it's a German style game).  While not as detailed or delightfully bloated as the similarly themed Urban Sprawl, this game makes up for the lack of meat with a very lean and tight presentation.  I highly enjoy.

J'avais une furieuse envie d'y jouer, mais avoir découvert "Between two cities" quelques mois avant m'a refroidi à la lecture des règles : il y a pas mal de points commun. Mais là où "Between two cities" est simple, rapide (mais moche), Quadropolis introduit un système de décompte ultra tarabiscoté qui permet certes de varier les parties, mais qui est trop foutraque pour moi. Les nombreux niveaux de règles et variantes de jeux me donnent l'impression d'un je à la base simple, mais qu'on a voulu complexifié pour lui donner une fausse profondeur. Bref, plutôt déçu.

My wife and I really like this game. It feels casual, but also a bit brainy. And with 2 - can play pretty quick. Really nice for an after work, feeling pretty tired but still want to play something instead of entirely vegging out. Also played with 4. Took a bit longer.. but the nice gameplay was still there. We love the art. The other couple we played with did not.

Quadropolis is a nice family tile selection and city building game mixing various mechanics with great artwork. The game is a perfect choice for family and light gaming. The classic version has 4 rounds and is a bit simpler. The Expert version has 5 rounds, introduces new types of tiles, however seems to drag a bit and overstays its welcome.

[Plyaed 1 time]

It is a simple idea (draft tiles that will score points accoridng to quantiy or adjacency), but well executed, with no uselless frills and a clever "the single card you play has multiple meanings" (what you can draft, what you make unavailable for the next player and where you can place the tile on your board - that is, how well it is going to score).

It features two rule-sets (that modify the game a bit more than merely adding a few rules, so they seem to "determine a flavour" rather than the typical "determine complexity").

It lacks interaction and "depth" (you just try to score more points), but it is a quick filler that doesn't claim to be more than that.

Zentraler Mechanismus sind die Architekten. Jeder Spieler hat vier davon und die legen wir nacheinander und reihum an eine Auslage von 25 Gebäuden. Die Position des Architekten bestimmt, auf welche Reihe oder Spalte wir zugreifen, seine Nummer, welches Plättchen darin wir an uns nehmen dürfen. Danach legen wir das Plättchen auf unseren 4×4 Spielplan, und zwar so, dass Zeile oder Spalte mit der Nummer des Architekten übereinstimmen. Dieser Ablauf vollzieht sich in 4 Runden, dann wird unsere Stadt gewertet. Dabei gibt es diverse Siegpunktbedingungen: Parks werten benachbarte Wohnhäuser, Häfen wollen nebeneinander liegen etc.

A city building game all about adjacency.  The forced grid pattern and its relation to your workers is unique and leads to some tough decisions.  I prefer the family game to the advance, as I feel the advance game loses some of the forced choices as scoring opportunities open up.

My favourite city building game. Well it is my only city building game ... but it is a favourite.

Great artwork and simple mechanics that bring what could be a very abstract game to life. Lovely decisions to be made and a variety of ways to win, that seem to be well balanced.

So far we have only played the classic game, and I am still enjoying that, The expert game adds a whole layer of extra wrinkles and decisions that I am looking forward to. Just need to play with the same people a few times so we can try it out.

This is one of those games that can be played and enjoyed by anyone.  Its depth and length is enough to make it not boring for the hardcore gamer, but not too deep to lose the casual participant.

I'm a huge believer in this game. It's mostly everything that I want from a game with no real downsides. I love games that give you a rewarding feeling. While I can appreciate games that are hard on the players and beat you up for doing the wrong thing, I just don't like the feeling I get from that style of game. I always walk away from a game of Quadropolis feeling happy, even if I did poorly.

The gameplay is just so smooth in this game. Every turn is literally one action, but jam-packed with decisions. The perfect, open-information style of the game is really nice too. You see everything that everyone else sees. Even if someone has a bit of AP, they are literally only doing 1 thing, and for half of that thing, the next player can start on their turn. Gameplay is very solid.

The production value being top-notch is just icing on the cake, but should not be understated. DoW really outdid themselves here. The insert is perfect, and even includes a section for re-using the cardboard inserts to prop the components up to prevent them from sliding during storage. All of the colors are vibrant and stand out very easily. The price tag on this game is well worth it.

Overall, a solid game that I think has a place in nearly anyone's collection.

Just enough meat in the base game to keep it interesting. It is very tactical with 3+ players. You're not blocking intentionally, moreso weighing the strength and future availability of tiles versus your (and your opponents) available arrow placements (e.g. - I can place a 2 now and get that tile I sorely want, but there are limited options for 3s and I may get shut out of those soon. However, one opponent already used a 3 and the other probably doesn't want that tile. Hmm...).

In any event, I can easily envision this being best with two. More chances to place the black pawn to block with purpose as well as plan more than a move ahead.

Virtually perfect all-rounder.

There are are only so many strategic paths to take and I feel I've already done them.  However, I'll continue to play this with my kids and with friends who enjoy the lighter side of gaming.

CLASSIC GAME:
Have to say that I wasn't blown away by it like most people seem to be by seeing reviews and videos.

I like the way it plays but it looked to me that the players are encouraged to stick to a strategy for the game, the tiles are basically the same from "Age" to "Age" and if you go for Harbors don't get distracted by other things... go for it.

ADVANCED GAME:

The Advanced game is so much better than the classic one... much more choices to be made, one more round of gameplay and a bigger city to build... much more interesting!

A fast, light, breezy, nice-looking city-building game. For someone with a moderate-to-large collection, this game doesn't stand out at all, but it is a great "next step" game for someone building a collection.  For me, this compares favorably to Suburbia: Suburbia is just a bit too long, too dry and too mathy.  Between Quadropolis and Five Tribes, I would pick Five Tribes every time!  If you are considering this and you don't have Five Tribes yet, get Five Tribes first!

This is Days of Wonder usual great production quality game. It is a tile placement its building game that plays very quickly. I only played the basic version but people said the expert version is even better for hardened gamers. You select ties from a grid over 4 rounds and place them on your city grid. There are restrictions for both choosing  and placing the tiles. At game end you score your 16 tiles depending upon adjacent tiles, workers placed on them etc. etc. Very smooth actions and everyone who played it enjoyed it.

This is a hit for Days of Wonder and a perfectly weighted game for their target market.

The game has two modes, with the classic playing more like a gateway game and the Expert game offering something more for the gamer market. 

Essentially Quadropolis is about using a team of architects to build a city, which is made up of various structures such as towers, harbours, shopping centres, factories and the list goes on. 

Each of these building types must be placed in your Quad shaped city, which itself is split into quadrants. Each structure will score according to a different set of rules based on its placement and vicinity to other structure types. 

The final edge to the game is that the architect used to capture a tile (numbered 1-4) will also determine the position of the tile that can be gained from the marketplace and also where it can be placed in your city. 

It all works really well. Some may see the game play as a little generic based on what has come before, but I certainly had a good time with it and there is a place in y collection for this as I have several gaming groups that will enjoy it regularly.

This game is themed nicely for my 11-year-old, and we enjoyed the game, but I think adults playing would enjoy this too. There's scope for some tactical play (blocking others, choice of buildings for different resources) and there is an expansion that will add further complexity. I bought the game for about £28, and I think that's money well spent!

The design itself is not bad. It's a light weight strategic game, but I wouldn't call it "city building". It's tile laying on a graph, hence the name I suppose. I do not feel like I'm really doing anything except graphing tiles in a certain way.  Nothing fascinates me about it and is rather dull.

Upon initial inspection, pretty delightful. This is a game that you can play as casually or as cutthroat as you want. The classic game, played my focusing entirely on your own board and plans, is a breezy filler. Played on the expert side while hate-drafting tiles to deny your opponent is another affair entirely. It's admirable that the design can tolerate so much attitude adjustment. Time will tell how balanced the tiles are (though this being a drafting game perfect balance isn't necessary) and whether or not the scoring opportunities continue to present a puzzle over time, but for now this is a solid hit in my book.

Bel giochino, la versione avanzata si avvicina a quello che io considero un 3 di 'peso', forse senza raggiungerlo, il gioco dispone anche di una versione family che può anche essere considerata introduttiva ma comunque non priva di attrattiva. Il gioco è carino e simpatico, forse un po' semplice e alla lunga ripetitivo. Interessante approfondire le varie strategie possibili ma attenzione all'interazione. Tipico gioco dove non ostacolarsi significa consegnare la vittoria a chi ha scelto la strategia più redditizia, ma ostacolare il leader significa sacrificarsi facendo kingmaking, alla lunga questo aspetto fa storcere il naso ai giocatori più competitivi e 'german'. Gioco godibile, ma non un magnifico IMHO.

This is a really fun game. I thoroughly enjoy each play, even though I don't believe I've ever won. I appreciate that the game comes with an advance variant and a mini-expansion right out of the box.

It is an elegant design, and it doesn't overstay it's welcome. The scoring is intuitive & clever, and the light resource management is not overwhelming for this lighter game.

The most exciting game I helped facilitate had the following scores: 55, 55, 55, 57!

[b]Quadropolis[/b] was sold via auction 10/15/16.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8 -> 6)[/COLOR]

[i]Looking back Quadropolis is the only game I missed the mark on. Initially I compared this favorably to Suburbia, but I was wrong. In the end, even playing the expert game, there just wasn't enough variety in the buildings, which also meant ways to score points, to make the game interesting in the long term. The highlight of Quadropolis was the tile selection mechanic, somewhat similar to Targi, but there wasn't enough there strategy wise to keep pulling this one off the shelf. After collecting dust for a while I finally sold my copy and my kids and I haven't missed it. Suburbia still reigns supreme in our house when it comes to city building games.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]- Like all DoW titles Quadropolis is a breeze to set up and teach, this will make a great family game.
- The standard game is quite simple and will function well as a gateway game and introduction to the game mechanics.
- The expert game adds two new buildings and opens up a lot more synergies between the buildings.
- I enjoy the spacial puzzle of having to use the builders to select buildings, it adds a thoughtful challenge to what could have been a more simple selection process.

For me this is a tale of two games, the standard game vs. the expert game. The first game I played was with my two older kids and we started with the standard game and my son and I were less than impressed. While I enjoyed the spacial puzzle of using your builders to select buildings, but I thought the game was lacking in building diversity. Each building has a very specific way to score points and only interact with some of the other buildings. 

Next my son and I played the expert game and that's when Quadropolis really opened up and became a much deeper and more interesting game. Just adding a few buildings really changed how you played since there were more building synergies to explore. It also adds a 5 builder which opens up the building board more and you share a common pool of builders meaning that you can potentially use the same number twice.

Quadropolis or Suburbia? (quick answer - both if you enjoy city building games)

Suburbia is brimming with a huge variety of buildings that have a diverse set of powers and the ability to layout your city however you want with very few limitations. Quadropolis is in turn a much more constrained game because of the imposed restrictions on which tiles you can get on your turn and were they are placed (which is always determined by the number of the builder you use). While I enjoy having to work with those restrictions in Quadropolis, I probably prefer the variety and openness found in Suburbia. 

However; I think both games have a place in your collection especially if you enjoy city building games since they offer such different play experiences. I'm looking forward to more plays of Quadropolis and I'm curious to see if it will stand the test of time as well as Suburbia has (I've currently played Suburbia 33 times).[/i]

I've only played 3p on the experienced, longer-playing side, and under these conditions it seemed too easy to focus on your specialisation and acquire your desired tiles. It felt too painful for other players to sacrifice picking up a tile they wanted for their specialisation just to take a tile to hurt you, as that would leave the third player alone to continue specialising - as in, he who's left alone the most wins. The pastel colour scheme is cutesy, the draft limitation mechanism is of interest, but the scoring system pretty much follows standard Euro fare - build this colour high, this colour next to that colour, this colour spread out, etc. As such, it's too abstract for my family, and too simple for my gamers, leaving it stranded in the middle as a game that works but doesn't pull me back for more.

Rating for my new French version for the really poor, thin flimsy play mats...compared to say the play mats in Glass Road which serve the same purpose it's very disappionting ...either someone dropped the ball or maximising profit with the thinnest card mats possible. They also warp during play ...

The tiles are great, the centre board is great but the player mats will never hold up to repeated play ...and the corners will ding very quickly. Too thin to laminate ...but these mats are integral to play ...what on earth were they thinking ?

Very disappointed in them ...the play aide is the same thickness or I should say thinness of the player Matt ...at least it could be thick or stiff card ...

Game play is okay at a 5 ...but not as interesting as Small City or The Capitals...or Surburbia ...if you are a heavy / serious gamer you will need to play at expert level ...if you don't have something else instead ...

Revised game play down to a five ...happy to trade now ...it's too much of a pain constantly putting out tiles especially in the expert game ...not the best DOW game ...okay for families I guess if they have nothing else to play ...and revised overall rating down to 2

Simple mechanics and easy rules combined with not so easy decisions such as which tiles to get, which architects to use, and where to place them on your board.  One of those games that's the perfect combo of easy to learn and gives plenty of depth in the game play.  The components are outstanding both in quality and look.  This is a beautiful looking game and a beautiful design.  Recommended to all!!

1 Play - first experience of this was fantastic. This gave me a very similar experience as Between Two Cities did, except this game had far more deluxe components and much more interesting decision making (and a bit more depth).  Really enjoyed this, but expect it would also become a little less "puzzly" after a few plays and some familiarity. There is much less player interactivity in this (1 players move might block another's) compared to between to cities though, where you really are engaging with your fellow players/ neighbors to build your city.

A vastly improved Suburbia.  The grid/architect system used for tile acquisition  is brilliant.  The scoring system is perhaps a tad too complicated for its own good, but that may be too difficult to avoid in a city building game.  I do think there are some viable strategies that may violate the spirit of building a good city.  A player in our game focused almost exclusively on apartments and skyscrapers while ignoring power plants, malls, and public buildings.  This in reality is not a very good city, but he almost won with it and had indeed won previous games convincingly this way.  This does not make this a bad game, but it is a tad disappointing to see what should be a good city get crushed by a city that would make no sense in reality.  Ignoring such squabbles, the game is easy to learn and play.  It plays very quickly and offers a good depth to complexity ratio.  And it's fun!

Quadropolis is a city-building tile game. The interesting part of the game is how tiles are acquired--they are arranged in a grid and can be taken by placing an architect labeled #1-4 on the side of the grid. This lets you take the tile that many spaces away from the architect, and restricts the placement of that tile on your player board to the row or column that corresponds to that number. Different types of buildings score in different ways, depending on the number of that building or its position with regards to other buildings. I thought it was an interesting puzzle determining how to take the tiles to put them in the right spots on your board, with the other players often getting in your way of course.

It's a game in the line of Cargo Noir or Mystery Express: there is absolutely nothing wrong with the game (well procuced, clear and easy to understand rules and everything works excellent together), but it will hardly be played.

Negatívumok: nem családi nehézség, inkább gamer beszálló szint, teljesen követhetetlen, hogy ki hogy áll és miben lehetne akadályoztatni a másikat a nyerésben, a zöldeskék és a zöld nagyon hasonló árnyalat, így összekeverhető.

That said, there are a lot of games that don't really offer anything new these days but it doesn't mean they're bad games in the slightest. This is a game of set collection and tile placement with a little interaction when selecting your tile. I enjoyed my back-to-back plays of Quadropolis, sneaking a win in the first game (normal side) and just losing out despite a full board in the second (advanced side). I preferred the advanced side of the board as it felt less restrictive and the common pool of numbers to choose from added something to the game. Solid game.

RATING: 8
This is a very fast playing abstract city builder, where players take turns selecting tiles from a central board and adding them to a spot on their player board that has a number that matches the numbered token used to take the tile. The numbered token indicates how many spaces away from the edge of the selection board the desired tile is. There is also a pawn that could stand in your way, and you can't place a selection token in the same spot as a previously placed one. The game goes 5 rounds with each round ending when there are no more legal moves. Then each type of building scores differently depending on how you placed it, and what you placed around it. It's a delightful puzzle with colorful, friendly components.

There are several strategies you can take, and some subtilty as you play a few games you start to see how to mess with other players with your selections, which reveals some depth. The fun part is absolutely the process of playing the game, as scoring at the end of the game can feel a little long, but that's such a minor quibble for a game that sticks in your brain for so long.

A simple and clean city-building game with amazing production quality. The tiles are thick and the insert is amazing (has a slot for every tile). The player boards are a little flimsy. The classic version is simple and streamlined; I haven't tried the expert mode yet, but it shouldn't be too complicated. The game is much easier to grasp than Suburbia.

RATING: 7
Only played using the expert rules. A spatial puzzle with a common draft, the expert rules seem to focus on optimization. There are lot of things to juggle laying out your scoring mat, also trying to juggle workers and energy so you can score your tiles. Looks to be a game of picking a couple of scoring routes and trying to milk them for all thee are worth. Collectin commercial buildings look to be the most powerful but the most difficult to manage. I did like the ideas behind the draft mechanism limited by the number you can pick and what was the last tile drawn. 
While I enjoyed the game it one I don't need to own. However, I did find that it looked good on the table.

This is a family abstract game with a city building theme. While there are other games that I want to play more; when I look at my collection I always consider this one. The art work is beautiful and it is a really simple game to teach. This game is better with three or four players. When playing with two players, by the time eight moves are completed you are going into setup for the next round. The setup in between rounds is what makes this game long. Without putting out new tiles, this game would literally take 15 minutes for two players. With the three intermissions for setup this game takes close to 40 minutes. That is a problem for me. I have found a solution to speed this up. You can stack all four rounds during initial setup so that in between rounds all players remove the tiles from the previous round and just flip the new ones. This has knocked down game time to about 25 minutes, but makes initial setup an extra ten minutes long. Quadropolis has some great decisions and really comes to a climax in the last round when you are running out of spaces to build on. After several plays, I have gotten a bit tired of making four move and then having to break to setup the next round. However, with four players, one round feels much more fulfilling. It will be a great game for the family when my kids get a couple years older. For now, I don't think it will hit the table very often for a two player game with the wife. I rate this game a 7 as a two player game, but when I get to playing this game with a family of four it could "possibly" bump up as high as an eight. *** Wife:8

Interesting puzzler with a town-planning theme. High potential for AP if you take any interest in what your opponents are up to with a view to trying to thwart them - the alternative being another case of multi-player solitaire.

The mechanics for selecting buildings from the center are puzzley in a way that I find interesting, but which is too chaotic to permit advanced reasoning in anything by a 2 player game.  The city-building game layered on top of the selection mechanism is pretty routine set collection + adjacency bonuses.  Overall neat in theory, but a bit boring in practice -- might be better 2 player.

i love this game, but it hasn't clicked for anyone else in three different gaming groups. i think for everyone else it's more of a puzzle to solve and the competition for pieces just gets in the way somehow. personally, the competition for pieces on the main board is my favorite part! i should probably try teaching it to my wife before i trade it away (ugh! it's a great game!!), but there's so many games in the universe and so little time for games that can't find their own way to the table. if i get Cat Lady then i've replaced not only this game but also Sushi Go. oh well, fun while it lasted. great insert: keeps set-up time down!

This is a nice replacement for Suburbia.  It's a little less complicated in acquiring victory points but it's much more complicated in acquiring tiles and blocking other player's purchases.  I really like the purchasing mechanism which is basically the premise of the entire game.

How you get tiles, by having architects you place around the edge of the board and grab however many columns as their number, and it dictates what column you put it in, and also you block the row and column as the tile you grabbed from, are all fun clever things that make this game very enjoyable. Another excellent family game from Days of Wonder.

RATING: 5
This comes with a tile selection mechanic that doesn't really add anything clever to the game so much as just provide a nuisance factor that gets in your way on occasion. Once you've worked out your own needs there's the potential to mess with your opponents, if you're so inclined. A little bit of interference can go a long way as the points scoring potential of different strategies seems well balanced. Look out for tiles your opponents need or if you can manage it block the next purchase of the player on your left. So it fits both roles as family game and in your face mess with your plans type game. Okay, I can see it. Ticket to Ride fits both bills and it's part of the Days of Wonder catalogue.

Besides that it offers the same points for adjacent tile scoring that we've seen in a number of city building games recently. Throw in an annoying counting off of citizens and energy supply minus citizens and energy consumption and you've thrown in just enough fiddling around to start to make it annoying. Spend a few minutes tallying it up at the end and you've probably lost interest at this point. I'm not sure how this one made it past the publishing selection process because it's more of the same just done not quite as well. There doesn't seem to be anything new here - just a mishmash of other games.

I guess if I hadn't recently played so many better city building games then this might appeal more. My judgement is probably clouded through too much comparison. Still, I'd far rather play Suburbia or Ginkgopolis or City Tycoon instead.

This game was a big let down for me. I was super excited to play it. It basically a solvable game. It maybe different with expert mode with 3 or 4 players, but currently it is too easy to do exactly what I want to do. Everything gives you points, and all about the same amount of points. It's pretty easy to get a good score, and every is just fighting a couple extra points. There's little variety in the game play since the same buildings are always available in the same quantity.

Other than the market/central drafting mechanism, Quadropolis plays, scores, and feels like most other drafting and tile laying puzzle games.  I enjoyed playing it and realize that there are various strategies based on the tile availability and scoring possibilities, but didn’t really discover anything truly groundbreaking or compelling enough to capture my interest.  The production quality is good and the artwork is okay.  I would definitely play the game again, but drafting games are not really a favorite genre for me.

Only played classic game at two players so far. Silky smooth, tile drafting, and city building experience. Puzzle is interesting without being too challenging. While the transition from level to level can be a bit abrupt, the overall experience is well-paced and breezy. I enjoy this game quite a bit and find it scratches a different itch from suburbia. It emphasizes the spatial challenge more than suburbia and is relatively abstract (more about creating different patterns / relationships of tiles).

Quadropolis is a nice design. It's a fun game that plays quickly. While the "expert" variant is disappointing, the "classic" game is a great puzzle that is quite engaging. However, it lacks any sort of lasting impact. The game is over in 20-30 minutes and considering how much upkeep you have to do between rounds, it's just not worth it. The game feels very soulless as I never feel like I'm actually building anything. This is essentially a filler game and a big miss for Days of Wonder in my eyes. There are better, and smaller, filler games and if you're looking for a city building-type game, there are also better and more fulfilling games than this one.

RATING: 6
It's an okay game, just not really a hit at my house, especially not with the 12/13-year-olds. It's an interesting strategy, but there's no real interaction between players. There's too many options available to really block others, and once someone has a set strategy they stick often stick with it for better or worse. One thing I do have to comment on is the incredible insert. Best insert for organizing the pieces I've seen in any of my board games.

Excellent tile selection game. Beautifully done, especially with the translucent meeples and resources, which I've come to expect from a Days of Wonder game. I love how only use a numbered token to indicate the tile that you are selecting, but it also indicates where you place it. It of course has some nice city building placement rewards but also has a nice resource management mechanic where you carefully have to get just the right amount of population and resources, so that you can power the scoring of your tiles, but not get so many as to be penalized.

Note: This review was based on the the expert variant, not the standard variant.

I really wanted to like this more than I did. I wish there was a mechanism to limit the number of possible choices each round. You can pick any of the 25 tiles and then there are many different ways to actually pick and place the tile you want. Do you take it with a 5 or a 1? Do you want to put in District 1 or in District 3 in spot 1 or in District 5 etc. But now what if I take this tile instead... I felt like I was just sitting there constantly running through all the possible combinations and trying to figure out which would benefit me most. Maybe I would enjoy the standard variant more. On a different note, I will say this game came with a great player aid for how scoring is calculated. In addition, the game had a high production quality. The plastic meeples were nice. I also enjoyed the cartoonish style art.

Simple but nifty, I love mid-weight games along those lines. Additionally, city building (or any kind of building be it cities or train routes or whatever) is always very satisfying I think, so win win here.
Once you got the rules down (which is not hard to do) it will play very quickly, with 2 players as we played it you can easily stay under the time of 30 minutes, have yet to play with more. And while I don't think that is problem per se, I really enjoy the game, I think it comes a bit overpriced and with the expectation of a bigger game.

Nicely designed insert and a wonderful production job. v simple rule set, slightly worried it will be v low interaction. 
----------------------------------
Puzzley game play, planning consists of choosing 3 or 4 options and hoping the other players or the urbanist don't screw you over. Good to have as many options as possible for last placement. May eb with more play there might be some min/max interaction but 1st play is just trying to find legal and semi sensible moves. So far much prefer this to Five Tribes/Relic Runners.

4th Play with Expert rules/tiles. Prefer to Basic. Scoring a little more interesting and we are trying to screw each other over with tile selection.

Played twice, once with the expert variant.  I'm still pretty unsure what I thought.  I haven't really wanted to play it again, but I don't know why.  I'm not sure this is fair, but I often felt while playing it that my choice was too obvious, especially in the second half of the game (when a scoring strategy has been set).  It feels like the kind of game that will always be really close, because everyone is grabbing tiles, and those tiles will be worth a similar number of points.

That said, it seems like a good game overall, and I like the city-building theme.  I'd certainly try it again.

This is a great gateway game. There aren't many rules, and none of them are complicated, but there are meaningful decisions to make. The game is also a nice length to introduce people to the gaming hobby. Not too long, not too short. The components are also nicely done--including the box. A satisfying game to play.

We are a 2 player household. We enjoy games like castle of Burgundy, twilight struggle, Russian railroads, S.Feld games, tzolkin. We own suburbia, witch is the advanced Quadropolis. Q. is a fun great easy game enjoy to play. We added following rules (we play only the expert version) a) the water tiles only count if one tile is a the border of the player board b) each round you have the opportunity to place a extra tile if you place a 3rd same tile, your turn is immediately after you placed the tile c) if you build high the third tile has to be payed with the requirement of activation, also at the same moment the tower has to be activated
We are looking forward to more tiles / expansions

Original (02-11-17): Perfect gateway game. Simple rules to grasp with a surprising amount of depth to make it enjoyable for more seasoned gamers. The only downside is that it's only 4 players. 9/10.

Edit (05-22-17): Don't play this as much anymore. Gets a little stale if played too often. I'll still keep it and pull it out every so often. The expansion looks nice and I'll have to get it and see how much it improves. 7/10.

tl;dr: solid family friendly strategy game

I've only played the 'expert' version, but I was explained the differences. It sounds like the 'family' version mostly takes away options from the players to make the game easier to grasp and shorter.
Without those limitations, the game is on the lighter side of the strategy game spectrum, but I still consider it a strategy game, not a family game.
Anyhow. The rules are easy to understand and the strategies to pursue are plentiful. Some turns choices can be quite hard. Good stuff.
And like most Days of Wonder games, this is very well put together again. And I was glad to see it was printed in Germany.

The end result feels like Between Two Cities, but with more control over the tiles, more thought into placement, and a longer playing time. AP can be a problem. I am not big on tile-laying games unless I feel I am building something and this game doesn't give me that interest. It is more like a puzzle and I am not into puzzle-like games.

RATING: 8
Extremely tentative rating that I hesitate to even log, but Quadropolis surprised me. When I read the description, I was unimpressed. I thought, "Yet another city builder." However, it is in fact a charming middle weight game of point optimization. There is some (very) mild player interaction that has more to do with inconveniencing other players (speaking of the basic game only here; haven't player the advanced rules); however, if you are in the mood for something engaging and quick, this might be the game for you. Most enjoyable is that it knows what it wants to be. There isn't an overwhelming amount of options. The strategies are obvious, but not automatic. You may have to change your plan mid-game depending on what the other players choose, but you can see it coming. More than anything, the game pulls together elements from games that have come before, but does so in a well-polished, pleasing way. Nothing screams "innovation," but that's okay.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
The new Days of Wonder game and it's city building (one of my favorite themes since I'm a civil engineer).  I really liked the optimization and strategy of the architects.  The whole game is very clean.  My main complaint is that there isn't much player interaction.  But, this is usually true of any city building game.  [thing=123260][/thing] did a pretty good job of including player interaction, but the income/population track dragged that game down for me.

Right now I'd put Quadropolis slightly below Suburbia, but the expert game might be able to push Quadropolis to the top of the city builders.

UPDATE: My original play of this was with 2 players and I found it a bit underwhelming.  My second play was with 4 players and the game became much more exciting.  And I still haven't had a chance to play the advanced version yet.  This is a game that I definitely want to play again and could maybe even see acquiring at some point.

:star: Awesome production quality, as you'd expect from Days of Wonder
:star: Figuring out how to get the buildings you need into the spots where you need them is a great puzzle
:star: I like the way you need meeples and energy to activate your buildings, but having too many is a problem

:nostar: Only goes to 4 players
:nostar: Setup for each round is a bit of a bother even at the full player count, and it looks like it'd be worse for lower counts

Like all Days of Wonder games Quadropolis is super polished. The insert is fantastic, there's both a "classic" and an "expert" mode, and the graphic design is top notch.

Quadropolis is a very nice looking family game in which players take turns selecting buildings to add to their personal tableau, trying to maximize their score for having certain combinations of buildings by the end of the game. It is easy to explain, plays quickly and really looks attractive. Even though it is pleasant to play, I find the gameplay of the basic game a bit too shallow to really excite me. Time to try the advanced version!

First impressions: What an absolutely surprise! If you dislike low conflict/low interaction games, then this is not for you. But for others who enjoy a multiplayer solitaire "pick-a-tile-place-a-tile" design with indirect interaction, Quadropolis offers something a little deeper than the initial reading of the rules. Game play is straightforward but the restrictions imposed on tile selection and tile placement really makes the game a bit more complex than first meet the eye. My worry was that too many restrictions coupled with denial of choice tile selection would make for a frustrating city building experience. As it turns out, while you may not get your top choice during tile selection, there are often comparable substitutes that can yield points and nothing is truly terrible. Deciding which tile to go for when others are not is key. Also the introduction of the two resources: meeples and energy is brilliant. It introduces another layer of complexity that will alter your tile selection somewhat as you seek to balance the collection of the two resources. 

I really enjoy games that allow specialization for scoring. Individuals can pursue a specific road to victory and the person who can straddle the fence without stretching themselves thin usually ends up victorious. Quadropolis is such a game.  With 25 city blocks, player have limited real estate to build their city. The winner is thus someone who can select tiles that no one else is building. There is certainly a sense of pleasure and achievement when you get to complete your goals and score maximum points for the type of city block you are gunning for.

One worry I have is replayability. The game may not stand up to repeated plays. I could see how players quickly develop combos and stick to their favorite tiles. Theoretically since the tiles are the same each round, there is little variability between each play so long as you go early during the game. Still, if you have large rotation of games each game night, this may be an occasional game you pull out for the city-building crowd.

Oct 2017: Lowering rating from 9 to 8.  Still a great game, but it doesn't make the table as often as other games and I'm trying to quit giving everything in our collection 9-10 stars just because we like it.  (Even if they're all good, some are still better than others!)

Have played this quite a few times now at player counts ranging from 2 to 4.  It plays well at all player counts - excellent scaling incorporated into the rules.  This is a really fun game.  It may seem like there are best strategies, but we've found that there is no one thing you can focus on to guarantee a win.  Each type of building, if used right, can score a lot of points.  Even if you try to focus on one thing, you almost always end up having to adapt with the game and the tiles available.  It's fairly easy to teach (though new players often say they didn't fully understand the scoring until after they finish a game) and the box organization makes setup a breeze.

Played both the basic and advanced game types.  It's a clever game.  Kind of felt like next-level Splendor to me.  Not that it shares much with Splendor but kind of a vague similarity with taking turns grabbing something from the pool and quietly pondering your own best move the whole game.

The lack of interaction and table talk makes it a game that I will never really love, but it's nice for a lighter weight, easy to explain game that plays pretty quickly.  I liked it... but it didn't excite me.

►REMARQUE(S) PERSONNELLE(S):
® Je crains qu’il retienne peu l’intérêt des joueurs lorsque le stade de la nouveauté sera passé.

Jeu où chaque joueur récupère des bâtiments du plateau central « Chantier », qu’il place sur son plateau-grille « Ville » afin de créer sa cité, et marque des points en fonction de la disposition de ceux-ci (adjacents et non-adjacents, empilement, nombres, etc.).

1e essai à 3 joueurs (version Expert). Version qui se joue en 5 manches (4 en version classique) et dont les plateaux-grilles « Ville » offrent plus de liberté de disposition que ceux de la version classique (cependant les plateaux-grilles restent identiques pour tous). 

À noter que ce soit en version classique ou expert, chaque manche présente toujours les mêmes tuiles, seul leur disposition sur le plateau « Chantier » change d’une partie à l’autre. De ce fait, je crains que la combinaison de séquences de tuiles identiques vs plateaux identiques ne mènent qu’à 1 seule disposition optimale et je me demande ce qu’il restera de sa rejouabilité lorsque cette disposition optimale sera connue et que chaque joueur tentera de la réaliser plus rapidement/efficacement que ses adversaires.

This is a medium-weight tile-placement game with some neat mechanisms going on in it. My first play was fun, though I didn't consider owning it; my second play was fun, too, and raised my interests a bit more, but I'm still not convinced I need to own it.

1 play: 4 players (classic)
1 play: 3 players (expert)

A simple city building game. I fear this can become a bit repetitive, as all tiles are used in every game, so the only variation is their location.

Enjoyable short city building game. Can be pulled out even with non gamers as the concept is pretty straight forward. There is however a whole lot of strategy and tactics behind choosing and placing tiles if you really want to go down that avenue.

"Solid 7" Euro material. Light to medium weight game food for family night. Goofy artwork can be overlooked for fun and fast game game play. My box came with The Playgrounds mini-expansion.

RATING: 7
It's hard for me to rate this game - everything depends on the player count and selected mode.

When I played this game for the first time with 4 players in a "classic" variant I didn't like it at all. Picking up different buildings was rather chaotic and it was hard to plan anything - by the time the turn got back to me the situation on the board was radically different and I just had to take what was available. 

Things get way more interesting when you play "classic" variant as a 1v1 game or when you play Quadropolis in "expert" mode - this is where the game really shines. It's still simple, but it's much more competitive and challenging.

On the surface there's not much to this game. You grab a tile and you place a tile, that's it. But it's more interesting than this. The mechanisms of this game are very elegant and the rules are easy enough to consider Quadropolis as a great family gateway game. 

As a sidenote - the game looks great, but the quality of the player boards and player aids is very poor. They are ultra thin and the corners were already worn out a little bit straight out of the box. For this price this is unacceptable.

Simple and slick. Meeples, mayor and start player are worth buying the game for! Could see that it has possibilty for AP for those who would work out all possibilities but if you play more from the gut then it is a good puzzle type game.  A long filler.

This one took a few plays before I could really appreciate it. Initially you'll feel that there's not a lot of interaction between the players. But you really have to keep an eye on what others are doing. If you let one person run away with a certain strategy, they'll score heavily. Also the choice of which architects to use first and which to keep until the end of the round is more important than you would think. You need to study the board carefully each time it is refilled in order to set priorities for yourself. edit: four months later and still enjoying the game quite a bit: upped my score to an 8, partly because it's easy to introduce newcomers to it.

City building tile selection puzzle. Random city tiles are placed in a row-column central grid. Each player places one of their numbered architect markers to claim a tile. Claimed tiles are placed on player's own city board to take advantage of adjacency placement rules of the different building types to score points. The Urbanist marker adds a unique element by locking down the row and column from the intersection of the last tile taken.

I imagine it would get repetitive and old quickly, otherwise a good game. 

Great player interaction with how tiles can be picked up. Good change to the tile laying genre by restricting how tiles can be picked up and how they can be placed. Plays quickly despite limited choices as rounds progress. 

Tiles spread in a 5x5 grid. Place your architect a numbered 1 to 4 to take the 1st through 4th tile from that edge. The tile then must go in the same numbered row or column in your city. Score points for putting parks near housing, people in stores, factories near wharfs, etc.

I've played far too many city-building games where you score points for having things adjacent to things, on top of things, and nowhere near other things.

In this case, I emerged victorious by chasing the same two scoring strategies over and over again.  Of all my wins over the past two years, this was probably the dullest.

In games where players select tiles from a shared pool,  it always comes down to the same strategy: Grab the tiles that no one else is fighting over and you'll usually come out ahead.

8+ plays in, and I really appreciate the novice vs expert modes of play. Personally, I don't find the "expert" to be much more difficult, but it's nice to teach non-gamers the basic version first. 

Despite the cutesy graphics (which some either love or hate), I believe there's more depth to this game than some give it credit for. There's strategy in not only building your city to score points, but also potentially blocking your opponents from getting a tile they need.

It does occasionally provide more AP than expected, but will remain a keeper in our collection.

Owned with Monuments of the World Promo Tiles.

Great city building game that reminds me a lot of Five Tribes - it looks nice and cartoony, but underneath is quite the thinky puzzle. The way in which you select your tiles makes for a great  minigame of trying to guess what the other players are doing to make sure you don't get locked out of a tile you want. Unfortunately, this seems to have brought out some AP, which really slows the game down. Unrelated, the cardboard is nice and thick, and the energy units and inhibitors are great quality too!

This was a game that I was very pleasantly surprised by. It's a puzzle with a nice coat of 'iOS city building game app'. At first glance it may seem like multiplayer solitaire, but the subtle interaction is really in snatching away tiles in front of other players. You can make this game as deep as you want by looking at the architect numbers your opponents still have, and trying to predict what they will go for next. And I haven't even played the expert game yet! I think I'd only play it with 4, tho. Flipping over tiles with fewer players does randomly limit certain options.

Let's say there is so much competition out there for this type of game. I enjoyed the few plays I had, but I found the restrictions too tough. It's an interesting system, but in the end I don't know how much appeal the tile selection mechanism has compared to regular drafting, which in turn makes this game a bit subpar compared to other city building games. An OK game, though. Box insert looked strange, though, apparently you cannot sort the tiles the way you would like.

An abstract, puzzly tile laying game with a city building theme.  I like trying to manage the spatial scoring with all the restrictions based on the architects you play but overall this is a bit too light for me to get excited about.  That being said my kids think its pretty neat and there is enough game here to entertain me so I'm quite happy to have it on our family game shelf.

Játszottuk ketten is és négyen is. Gyönyörű városépítő játék, reális logikával a pontozás terén: azaz nem mindegy, hogy a gyárak mellé építjük-e a lakóházakat, amit nem szeretnek a lakosok, ezért nincs érte pont, ahogy az sem, hogy pl. egy parkot mi mellé teszünk: az meg lakóingatlan mellett ér pontot. A városépítés logikája olyan, mint az életben. Ugyanígy az sem mindegy, hogy mi mellé kerül a városunkban a bolt, a kikötő vagy az önkormányzat. A lapokat az építészeink hozzák el a közös területről. Nyersanyagot/energiát fizetünk értük (ezek azok a szép piros és áttetsző rubin kövek), a városfejlesztésünk pedig lakosokat hoz, akik, mint munkaerő számítanak majd más lapok megszerzésében. Egyszóval stilizált formában, de teljesen logikusan függnek össze az építkezés és a pontozás során a dolgok. 
Ami a játék hátránya, hogy bár képzeletünk meglódul a stilizált építés során, nem egy interaktív társasjáték a Quadropolis. Mindenki a saját külön kis tábláján építgeti a városa elemeiből a legtöbb pontot gyűjtő összeállítást, és még a különböző elemekből is annyi van, hogy előbb-utóbb mindenkinek jut olyan, amit igazából szeretne. Az interakció hiánya sajnálatos, de első látásra beleszeretünk a látványvilágba, és abba, amit a képzeletünk hozzátesz a városépítéshez.

A játék fontos negatívuma:
Az expert verzió bevezeti a toronyházakat is, melyekből, ha sokat összegyűjtünk, exponenciálisan nagyra növekszik a megszerezhető pontunk.
Csakhogy 4 toronyház építése alatt rosszul járunk, így aztán hamarabb fogunk 4 bármi mást megépíteni sokkal több pontért, mint toronyházat. Érdemes háziszabályt hozni a toronyházak pontozásában, mert úgy értelmet nyerhet azoknak a megépítése is.

Egy kis Between Two Cities saját táblával és draft nélkül, nyakon öntve egy adag DoW-os csili-vili látványvilággal, valamint családi és gémer fokozattal - ez bizony sokak kedvence lehet, az már most látszódik.

RATING: 7
A relatively themeless game about working the warehouses in the city of Hamburg, with a goal of obtaining the most points by game end, and a relatively unique bidding mechanic(s).

It should be noted that this is not a complete game without the [boardgame=78750]Kaispecher[/boardgame] expansion- the expansion is absolutely essential and improves the game immensely.  Gameplay involves placing a worker above a card you wish to obtain, and you can either choose a free card or bid above a previously placed worker (including one of your own).  The expansion adds another bidding mechanic, called the reserve, where you place on a card, reserving it for yourself, but the earlier you reserve it, the more expensive it is likely to be.  After all workers are placed, the cards are evaluated with the first position getting the first opportunity to buy or pass but the earlier you are in the queue the more expensive it is (essentially the same as in Leonardo da Vinci).  Then the reserve cards are evaluated in a somewhat similar fashion.  At the start of each new round you receive a paltry amount of money (money can be very very tight in this game).

How are points scored?  Through completing contracts, which require goods which are obtained through ship cards, through converting resources to points through processing buildings, through avoiding fires by having the most firemen, and through obtaining building and bonus point condition cards.  It should be noted that the expansion includes many, many new cards that can be used to score points and/or obtain money in a variety of ways.  The game ends after a set number of rounds.  

To sum up, Kaispecher adds: 1) metal coins (a very nice touch but not essential), 2) the reserve mechanic (sounds simple, but it's a HUGE improvement, and 3) MANY new cards, alot of which allow for new scoring opportunities.  Without the expansion this is maybe a 5, with it it's at least 2 points higher.  This works surprisingly well with 2 (expansion only of course).

RATING: 6
Tight money game with interesting auction mechanic. Each person places a worker behind the card they have interest bidding on. After everyone is done, the first person in the line can buy the card, but it cost 1 money for every guy in the line [including himself]. If he does not take the card, that worker leaves the line and the second person has the option to buy the card. Etc. If you do not buy any cards that round, you are given 2 money at the end of the round. 

Interesting, but frustrating to me because I found it hard to plan what to do. On average, you are going to be able to obtain one card per round, so it is a question of how the other players decide to block the card you want, if they buy it before you, or if you can afford to pay whatever price it is at to ensure you actually get the card.

RATING: 7
I have to admit that I like bidding in general, and thus Speicherstadt does not have to do much for me to find it appealing. But the game does a bit more with its interesting bidding mechanics, especially when playing with hidden money. 

Instead of traditional auction players are reserving the right to buy first, but the catch is that other players get to set the price. However, doing so means that you are passing an opportunity to do something else. So there is a lot to take into account. Sure the mechanics ensure that often your plans are screwed but the game treats all players the same. What makes the game even more interesting is that there are multiple ways to score points or to build leverage for your own play. Hence, every bidding round requires a new evaluation of the situation.

I would say that contents-to-length ratio is at a good level here. Not a masterpiece but a decent game for auction fans.

Simple game to learn but very brain burning.  Sort of an uber short game (I hesitate to deem it a filler).  It reminds me in tone of High Society in that it is fairly tough and each move is critical.  It is less brutal than that, longer, more varied and harder to play.  It's a great little bidder and fun to play.

RATING: 8
+ The auction mechanic in the game is very tense and hard to predict (which keeps things fresh); The different scoring criteria allow you to pursue some cards and ignore others.
- The board is so ugly!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Abstract:

Pros:
+ Twisted bidding system where players actually raise the demand. Players either bid to get a card or bid to make it more expensive for other players.
+ ...bluffing: players try to hide what they really want from each other
+ High interaction: prices are determined by the players via bidding, players try to increase the prices of cards that other players want
+ Players who pick cards from the extra row (expansion) have to pay more
+ Limited money: each decision has a big impact (goods-to-money conversion cards can be very helpful)
+ Players can convert goods into other types of goods at a higher ratio to mitigate if they do not get what they need
+ Special power cards are great and spices the game up
+ Order of the biddings is very important because players may run out of money until the last bidding (save money or get the card?)
+ Easy to teach, easy to play (just play first game with the base game)
+ Well written rules
+ Plays well with 3-5 players

Neutrals:
# Theme is great (did I mention that I am from Hamburg?)
# Artwork is okay (the board looks a bit boring, the cards are okay, clean layout)
# Turn order is very important: first player can be easily blocked
# Replayability: all cards come into play each game, there is nothing new per game, just the order of cards is different
# Randomness and luck depends on the order of the drawn cards including which goods are available. Moreover, the fire events are hidden somewhere in the draft deck
# Like most auction games, it needs some plays to get a feeling for the value of the cards
# Being first player is a disadvantage because other players are always able to overbid
# Tasks can be hard to get / achieve if other players pay attention and block the players from getting the task or the required goods
# Expansion adds take-that cards (e. g., thieving)
# Scoring happens between rounds and at the end of the game

Cons:
- Long playing time: bidding and buying cards feel repetitive over time, however, game runs very smoothly
- Very aggressive bidding system that encourages denial play without consequences since players who win the bidding do not have to buy the card (mean, nasty) 
- Confusing iconography for goods/colored cubes
- 2-players work, but is the most cutthroat because players spend most energy to block this one other player (bluffing is much harder). Moreover, firemen have a bigger impact if always the same player is rewarded or punished.
- The expansion "Kaispeicher" is very hard to find. Besides adding rare goods, the expansion makes the game much more interesting by adding another layer (row of cards) to the bidding.

Prior to playing Die Spiecherstadt, Macao was the only Stefan Feld game I had liked ("loved" is a better descriptor) and auction games were not things I enjoyed; so I walked into Die Speicherstadt not expecting good things. Boy, was I wrong!

Die Speicherstadt is a wondrous, short strategic game where at times one's tactics are more important than one's strategy. Yes, you really have to choose one from the many strategic options during the winter season, and woe to the player who tries to change his chosen plan midway through the game; but tactically, there will be rounds where one has to toss strategy to the winds when tactics dictate. The best strategic choice is to go for this particular card, but it is currently far more important to deprive Ned of this other card, or at least make it far more expensive for him. The best strategic choice is to go for this particular card, but I'm going to be low on Deutschmarks next round, so perhaps I should be placing my workers with that in mind. Delightful and painful decisions need to be made each and every turn!

Auction game though this is, it uses atypical auction mechanics, and so Die Speicherstadt never really feels like an auction game to me. Plus, apart from the dreary looking game-board, the Micheal Menzel art makes Die Speicherstadt far more thematic than any other Feld game I have ever played.

I love it! And tense though the game is, AP is never really a factor. In spite of what has been said elsewhere, I just don't find Die Speicherstadt overly cutthroat; "competitive" would be the better word. Two-player is about the only form of the game I would avoid.

2-5(4)

Initial review, and only after playing 2p (which I don't think I'd recommend, and I've seen this advice elsewhere).

I'm a huge Feld fan, but this one was tough to really love. It's a very "screw you" sort of game and going first is a terrible. It's just too easy for P2 to shadow P1 and, while paying two money for a card is always an option, it almost grants P2 the other cards for cheap.

There are surely ways to game this, but it seems that the strategy of the auction is degraded because anybody can effectively register a one bid by queueing their worker, while monkey-wrenching the other players who've queued.

I'm hopeful about the game, especially with more than two. I can see some reverse psychology: try to initially bid on what you DON'T want, saving your later bids for what you do want. Problem is, usually it'll be obvious enough what you do want and if you go first the players after you will be able to bid you up once you tip your hand regardless.

Quick, though.

Speicherstadt is an auction game. Being auctioned are sets of goods, contracts that require particular goods, and things than provide vp or money bonuses.  

The auction mechanism is quite novel, with players taking turns to place their three workers in queues.  The worker at the front of a queue gets first option on an item, but must pay a price equal to the number of workers in the queue - or drop out.  The worker at the back of the queue is there to drive the price up for others or perhaps get a bargain if everyone else drops out.  Money is very tight indeed, creating lots of potential to price another player out of a particular item and forcing some tough decisions about what you really need.

So far, so fun, but that's about all there is to this game.  The mix of cards you're bidding for is really quite dull, with little potential apparent for alternative strategies or for building an engine.

Production quality is good.  I particularly liked the shiny cardboard coins and the metal first-player coin.  I found the artwork rather insipid.

This is a game that I should have enjoyed more than I did.  After all, it includes multiple auctions, in this case, using meeple placements, and I do love auctions and auction games.  However, this one left me strangely cold while playing it...and after I played it.  Whoa, not good.  It felt so joyless placing my mere three meeples each turn, and my desire to "get" things on the board was very moderate in comparison to other auction games. The choices felt trite and very much "going through the euro motions." It was almost as if the auction mechanic was cooling the temperature of an already small, slight euro.

So often the meeple placements in this game felt like a mere effort to make the other players pay more for what they wanted rather than an expression of my wanting that item.  And I felt the other players were doing that to me as well.  And I spent most of the game taking my meeples off and NOT getting the item I placed them next to.  The result was substantially joyless.  I suspect there is a better game in here than I experienced on my first play, but I am not sure I would really want to play this one again.

Interesting austion mechanism. You get in line to try to buy a particular card (contracts, goods, buildings). If you're the only person in line at the end of "bidding", then you pay $1. But if one or two or three or four or...are behind you, then you must pay $2, $3, $4, $5, ... or drop out. There's a clever way to put more than one of your agents in line and get the card cheaper. The tradeoff is that two of your agents are tied up that round. Oh, and be mindful of the firefighters and the coming warehouse burnings.

I purchased this on the whim (stupid on my part, but it was a buy 1 get 1 for Z-man games at my FLGS) and after reading the rules and further comments on this game, I was getting a little worried as to how it would play out.  I imagined it to be really dry as the theme isn't all that interesting and the mechanics seemed to have a "been here, done that" feel.  BUT after finally getting this to the table, it played GREAT.  The thing that saves this game is its length of gameplay and scalability.  The game plays well from 3 to 5 players (haven't played this two players yet, but I think I may not enjoy it with that amount) and plays under an hour.  With repeated plays, I can see the playtime clocking in under 45 minutes (for 3-4 players at least).  This game is a great amalgamation of the worker placement mechanic with bidding (using workers to determine both pricing of cards [demand] and turn order for who gets to purchase the cards first).  The art/ design is clear and well presented.  The mechanics are very intuitive and allows for a lot of cleverness in terms of deciding when to just mess with other players purchases or in how to hide what you really want from others.  Overall a great, meaty worker placement filler.

Enjoy the bidding mechanic - which is the core of the game - but I don't find anything that surrounds it particularly pleasant (art, decisions, scoring, tension, etc.).  I wish it felt to me like the mechanic was invented by necessity to satisfy the needs of a game, rather than a game minimally developed to expand upon a mechanic.  I'd be more willing to play if it were even shorter, but I think I'd much rather have a filler-class expansion of the mechanic.  Perhaps I'd like it more with fewer players.  Still seems pretty swingy.

RATING: 7.5
Really simple, but clever auction game. For anyone interested, I'm sure you're not jazzed to hear about another game involving shipping goods, but this deserves a more serious look. The game leans more towards tactics than strategy, but it still feels like every choice is meaningful. Each worker placed to buy a card may get a chance to buy a card or at least cause more trouble for the opponent. The the "take that" feels effective, but not aggressive, especially when making the wrong assumption about an opponents actions. As I am not a fan of multiplayer solitaire, this is a great game that has you looking at your opponents space as well as yours.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Sometimes I think all the simple ideas are already taken somewhere then this comes along.  The bidding is very interesting and tension filled as sometimes you have to indirectly go for what you want sometimes so you can hedge your bet with another card and to hopefully make what you want cheaper or at least to expensive for the other guy.

The Buick of Feld. It's probably something he came up with in short order and without much thought. 

It's classic Feld, but really doesn't have a riveting theme, or anything to set it apart from his other games. 

It's not a bad game, not by any means. But there's little reason to play a bland game when you can play so many other non-bland games

A rather elegant game that hinges on a very good auction mechanic. The gameplay is simple but the decisions are interesting and the money tight, which creates tension. Overall, it comes together in a surprisingly refined way. And to play the game competitively, you need to have a strong awareness of what other players have, what they are trying to buy, and their ability to purchase it. 

There is game-induced randomness (ship cards, fires, etc) and meta-gaming could severely hamper your progress... but the randomness is well-managed (low variance) due to the different decks and it is difficult to screw over another player without hurting yourself. Thus, the game-play comes across as very meaningful.

Falls into my new rating system where every decent game (mainly euros) gets a 5. I'd previously been rating them 3's since there was no desire to play again. But at the same time, I grudgingly respect the design at a 7ish level. So I adds an integral to the coefficient of BO and resulted in a nice round 5. 

We played with the expansion and nice metal coins. Not sure if the expansion added any value when you factor in the time increase.

This was the first Feld game I played, and I fell in love. It took Kaispeicher to truly kindle the flame, so I would never play without it.

Reviews seem mixed, but I tend to like Feld games so I'm looking forward to giving this one a try.  I'll do my best to play it with 4 players because consensus seems to be 4 players is best.

Too bad for me that I'm an idiot and was playing the game wrong.  Maybe it was how the English rules were worded, but we awarded too many points for firemen which is what ruined the game.  It wasn't a great game, but one I may have kept had I been playing it right.  I've removed my rating until I play it again with the correct rules.

Edited 20100607: Play with 4 players was big fun!

Edited 20100613: Play with 3 players: a bit disappointing. 4 or 5 players seems to be best...

Played once with a major rule misunderstanding and had a great time anyway. Looking forward to another game, but it's hard to get a game with a name like The Speicherstadt onto the table.
I think this will eventually become a favorite among hardcore Euro gamers, as it fills the niche of being heavy on the strategy, light on the minutes-per-game.

An okay economic game of auctions and set collection.  Money is very tight, and it's a big benefit to be familiar with the cards that will come out during each of the 4 seasons.  

The crux of the game seems to be the fact that you only have room to store 1 goods cube (and only 1 person in the game can get a bigger warehouse)... so I think you really need to grab early contracts and 1-2 traders to make the most of your goods cubes.  The auctions are the main mechanism, and they can be very fierce and confrontational.  Since you have only a few chances to bid each round, there can be big swings in the game where some things get overbid and some things go dirt cheap.  Not sure if I like it after 1 play... I just feel annoyed, as if the game is playing me... but now that I am familiar with it, maybe a 2nd play will be more enjoyable.

The game felt a bit like Pirate's Cove to me... the game seems to reward players who can avoid confrontation (bidding wars)... for example, a good strategy is to bid on less desirable cards, hoping to get them for cheap... kind of like trying to go to the island that no one cares about in Pirate's Cove... of course, your opponents (if alert) might choose to bid up your crappy cards anyway so the strategy is not perfect.

Yucata, best w/4

I generally agree with what Snoozefest says: "Good, but not great. Like most auction games, you really have to play this with people who understand the value of the various items -- a newbie amongst experienced players will likely throw the game towards some lucky person."

Once again Stefan Feld has impressed me. This game is very unique from other Feld games in that blocking other players is as important (if not more important) than pursuing your individual strategy on any given turn. I was prepared to not like this aspect of the game, but instead found it a breath of fresh air! This game, with the right group could be a truly amazing gaming experience. With every new Feld game, I try, I immediately want to try his next game as he just so completely amazes me with his unique mechanics and clever design. Every game feels like a masterpiece. This guy is simply amazing and by far my favorite designer. Bravo Herr Feld!

Juego entretenido, sencillo de explicar y de jugar, con bastante puteo. Es de colocación de trabajadores, pero no para realizar acciones, sino para conseguir cartas.. y las colocaciones suponen variaciones en el precio de las cartas. 
Tiene dos fases principales. En una todos los jugadore por turno van pujando por las cartas (o reservándolas, para que nadie se las pueda llevar). Cuando todo el mundo ha colocado sus cuatro trabajadores, se resuelven. El precio de la carta depende de la cantidad de jugadores que hayan pujado por ella.
Las cartas te pueden dar mercancías (para cumplir contratos o convertir en dinero o puntos), contratos, bomberos, edificios, comerciantes, etc.
Durante el juego suceden 3 incendios y un último incendio al final de la partida. Los incendios premian al jugador con más bomberos y penalizan al que menos tienen.
Recomendable, y perfectamente apto para no jugones.

hmmm...this is a one trick pony.

A new, innovative auction mechanism. But that's all there is. Where's the rest of the game?

After doing it a dozen times, it got boring. Really didn't care whether we even finished our first game, as there was nothing more to explore or anticipate.

Update from July 2010 to July 2012. Dropped rating from 6 to 3. This one blows. It's such a boring one trick pony. Why did I give this a try again? About the only Stefan Feld game that I actively dislike.

A good game, but not great with two-players. The auctions are the most interesting mechanic: they give you a lot of control over what you can get, and since money is so constrained it becomes really critical that you get what you want every turn. Turn order ultimately decides everything, and if you're not the last bidder you can be pretty sure you'll be pushed out of something. So the game is a matter of figuring out what other people want, driving up their bids for those things, and then trying to make room for yourself somewhere else. The worst part of the game is the fires/firemen, IMO, which are an unnecessary addition and make the game impossible to win if one player gets an early lead on them.

I like this a lot - the auction mechanism is not only very clever but it plays quickly while forcing tricky decisions.  What's more, the design doesn't overburden itself with complex rules or scoring and the game length is nicely judged for the complexity so it doesn't suffer from undue repitition nor overstay its welcome.  A keeper.

RATING: 5
A neat bidding system where players place workers in order to try and obtain cards (or at least make those cards more expensive for someone else).  The very limited resources players are given make each decision pretty difficult.

Basically, you are trying to win cards in this game through worker placement.  Some cards get you resources, some cards turn certain combinations into points, and some cards are worth points or help you out in various other ways.  The crucial thing is to spend your workers carefully since you only have 3 per turn and you only have limited money to work with.

Overall, I found it to be a decent game of timing, although there is a lot of table randomness.  If no one drives up the price on you, you luck out.  I also wonder if there's enough variety here to make it very interesting from game to game.  Overall, I kind of feel that it's a cool bidding system without a great game to go with it.  I thought it was a fairly good entry into the super-filler category, although maybe a little unexciting.

It's a pretty good auction style game which can be played in half an hour if you have tried the game before. I think it's a decent game with 3, but it really shines with more players! Easy to learn but lots of different cards and ways to victory. Money is very tight in this game and the way you bid on the cards with your meeples is pretty unique and cool; I like how you can force other players to pay more than they originally intended to do. It's one of the better auction games considering the short playing time, but I vastly prefer real auctions games like Ra or Modern Art.

I like that the game because it is easy to pick up and play. My family loves to play it, along with friends from an occasional game night. I must say the game is not too deep and can seem repetitive after more plays because the cards are the same cards every game, just in a different order. This is probably my go to game for new people getting into the hobby because it is interactive with not an abundance of decision making.

Not really very good with only two players.  Have also played with three, and would like to try a game with all five players.  Definitely would be interesting.

EDIT:  08/05/16 - The Speicherstadt gets a bump after two recent plays following a long hiatus from the table.  I should never wait this long between plays, because it really is a fun game.  It also has a lot of "screw you" to it, which makes it very competitive, and lots of fun.

Rated 6 after one play. Nothing terribly unique here... it's auctions, cube gathering, fighting for VPs... but at the same time, the game seems very smoothly structured. You auction off and buy cards with money, but money is pretty tight. It plays pretty quick, and I like the fact that the deck contains unique items where you have one shot at something you want.

It's probably not a game I need to buy, as I'm chock full of aution games, but I won't turn it down.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This game didn't have as much take that as I thought it would. Yes you are placing your meeples to raise the price on your opponent, so they may not be able to buy that card, but with money being so tight it's also a wise strategy to save money and not spend it all in one turn.

I'd definitely play this again and would be interested in tracking down the expansion.

剛剛談及Stefan Feld, 本人又諸事說一番。Stefan Feld 的作品本人十分喜歡, 亦因有一位棋友是其超級擁躉，所以有幸可玩他大部分出產的作品，本人亦有珍藏他數盒作品(包括Burgundy, Trajan, Bruges, Norte Dame, In the year of the Dragon, Amerigo, AquaSphere, Luna, Speicherstadt 等) 在他的作品中有獨特味道, 多人說他的作品Dry, 是沒有靈魂的Euro Game。無可否認他的作品重點是其機制, 情景往往扣得薄弱, 但就是因為這樣才有他旳獨特風格，正如有人說為何烈酒好飲因為難飲，為何渣啡正因為飲者覺得型,  SF 的 game 給我一種愈Dry 愈型愈想嘗的感覺。 SF給我最有印象(不是最愛)和深刻的game 是Speicherstadt, 若用酒來評Speicherstadt, 它是一隻優雅脫俗的 dry, 簡單清醇把bidding 展現得淋漓盡致, 入口後 簡潔機制和 euro 非骰運的樸實相互融合, 嘗後感覺悠長持久。無論gamer 和non -gamer 都怡入, 酸甜平衡。(略加變則...提議遊戲中把banking 的一張棄掉或放於秋季。)說完了,大家一起在餐前嘗一口 Dry 的 Speicherstadt.

The game feels repetitive with constant resets and same actions and choices.  I'm sure there are several different strategies, but I won with only one eleven point contract complete and one one point trader card.  The thing that really set it off was the firefighters.  For being such a large swing in points, there is not much of an arms race for them.  It was not very tense, even though we were messing with each other.

Um, the emperor has no clothes. Was this game playtested? In our 3p game, it seemed the start player was completely hosed every round. Another player and I started joking that when first player, we would randomly choose where we go, even before we see what cards come out, because it really doesn't matter where you go. I also really didn't like that cubes don't come out in the A cards, which means no way to make money other than not taking a card. Lame. This left a really bad taste in my mouth. Will be avoiding. 

Note: some trustworthy gamers have said my analysis is incorrect, or at least didn't match their experience. I would be willing to try again to see, but I'm not very hopeful.

This is again a Stefan Feld: clear, concise mechanisms wrapped in a meaningless layer of subject matter. The core mechanism in this game is a special auction whereby the price is determined by the amount of players bidding on the item. If a player refuses to purchase the item for the price, he then removes his meeple from the bidding queue, lowering the price for who is next in line. This is quite a cute idea, to be honest. But why has it been married to a plain resource-to-VP conversion engine? That engine is so standard that it degrades the inventivity of the auctions. The Speicherstadt is short, I'll give it that... But regrettably also quite devoid of interesting stuff which make the game as a whole worthwhile. I suppose I won't say no to a rematch, but at the same time I'm perfectly happy if this never happens.

It feels like this whole game was made just around it's auction mechanic. But the auction part didn't really do anything for me, and the rest of the game was even more boring. Would have had more fun sleeping.

You better hope you aren't the first player, and don't sneeze on the auction or it might break it's so fragile.

RATING: 4
At first glance this game seemed to be a good classic euro design. Some auctioning with tight money, balancing goods with contracts to earn them. Other ways to earn VPs.
But the very tight money combines with the descending auction price to give the last player to place a big advantage. So success can hang more on where you are in the player order when key cards come up than anything else. It all just felt a bit too random to me.

When I first read the Speicherstadt's rules, I couldn't imagine what would be point of playing this blend of worker placement and bidding mechanics. Luckily, Eggertspiele decided to let Yucata implement an online version of this. I tried and loved it.

So, what's the Speicherstadt all about? Each player begins with three action meeples and five coins. At the beginning of each round, a number of cards equal to number of players plus one is placed face up on the board. Now, beginning with the starting player, each player places one of their meeples above one of the available cards. If there are already one or more meeples above a card, you place your meeple above them. Once everyone has placed their meeples, each card is up for sale. How much does a card cost, you ask? Well, the prize is equal to the number of meeples that are placed above a card. So, if there are three meeples above it, the player who placed his meeple first has the chance to buy the card for three coins or they can just take their meeple back. If they take it back, the next player in line can buy the card for two coins or back out too. If no one wants to buy a card, it is discarded. Repeat this until all face up cards have been sold or discarded. Afterwards, every player does some book keeping, receives one coin for the next round and new cards are placed on the board. This procedure is repeated until all cards have been up for auction one time. At this point, the game is over and the player with the most victory points is declared the winner. Money serves as a tie breaker.

But what is on that cards? Well, the cards come with different abilities. There are ship cards that give you three randomly determined resources each. Then there are contract cards that come with a demand of two to four resources. If you manage to put the needed resources on them, you recieve some victory points. Apart from these, there are also cards that allow you to sell some previously aquired resources or give you one coin extra each round. Other cards give you either plain victory points or points based on the amount of certain other cards you bought. And there are the firemen but I won't discuss them here.

So each round, you try to buy cards that will help you to be the one with the most victory points at the end of the game. This all sounds quite familiar, but once you start playing this game, you'll soon discover what a great mechanism was invented by Mr.Feld here. In a normal auction game, you can't participate in an auction if you don't have the needed money or you don't want to risk winning it. Here, you don't have to pay anything if you put down your meeple above a card. Instead, you can just put down your meeple to raise the price of a card. So you don't want your fellow to buy one card for cheap or buy it all? Well, then make him pay by putting down your meeple there or raise the cost of the card above what they can pay.

The whole mechanism leads to a lot of direct player interaction and tough decisions. Do I play my meeple on the card I want, thus revealing my intentions, or do I wait a little longer? But if I wait for to long, someone might get the chance to buy it before me and I can see, that they have enough money to do so as the game is played with open money. Every turn is full of tough decisions and it's just plain fun to play this game. And the best thing, you can't try it for free on [url]http://www.Yucata.de[/url].

Brilliant design! This game and London have opened a new category of games in my collection: the "Euro-Filler". 

Both are thoroughbred euro's with an economic theme but they consist of micro-turns and either can be played in less than an hour with 3-4 players, and probably 40 minutes with 2. 

Speicherstadt is the shorter and more streamlined of the two. Both London and this seem like perfect distillations of the designers' work: Wallace and Feld in their respective nutshells. 

At game nights what gets played is determined (at least once per night) by duration, so these are great games to have along. 

Edit: For one brief moment, Feld sacrificed his precious 'variability' for true 'playability'. In his recent sea of crap this is the only gamer's game, the only one where you cannot possibly luck into a win.

About a third of the way into Die Speicherstadt (which is German for "the Speicherstadt"), I was convinced that it was ass rapingly unfun.  But pretty soon I started picking up on subtleties inherent in the mechanics, and my enjoyment ticked upward.  It could do so again after another play, perhaps.

RATING: 5
Bidding game where you always seem to have too few coins available when needed. Actually I feel the money is a little bit too tight in this game. 

The bidding mechanism is cool at first but very soon get old when two players need the same things and just block each other while other players can get their stuff cheaply. It also too easy to get behind halfway through the game without any possibility for a come-back. Fun? Nope.

The expansion makes the game even worse by adding action cards. Avoid.

Players run warehouses for profit in Hamburg.  Excellent little auction game, where players place their three bidding pawns onto a lot of cards available this round.  When all pawns are placed, the cards are sold off to the first bidder, who has to pay the cost equal to the total number of pawns on the card ... or withdraw their pawn which means it's one coin cheaper for next in line.  Subtle, clever, nasty, brilliant little mechanic.  You gradually build up a portfolio of cards representing goods arriving by ship, contracts fulfilled by goods, firemen to protect your warehouse, and so on.  Clever little Feld game - tight and brutal, tons of cash-flow angst.  Enjoyed this one a lot.

Simple rules, screw your neighbor, nice strategic depth, what else do you need in a game.
The simple card buying mechanic means that the players need to think about where they place their meeples and how the other players will act. Nice amount of torture. 
Highly recommended.

Although there isn't a whole lot new here, it's still a pretty solid Stefan Feld game.   Typical of all Feld games, there is damage mitigation:  here you get a bonus for having the most firemen when the fires strike, but you get penalized for having the least.   The bidding mechanism is sort of like placing workers in a line.   Being at the front means you get first choice, but pay the most, while being at the back of the line means you might not get the card, but if you do, it will be dirt cheap.   Money is very limited and with the open information, the game feels very calculating and blocking other people might be more important than getting the cards you want.   At the end of the day, you get points for sets of goods and some bonuses.   Like I said, nothing terribly new here, but it's a competitive and accessible game.   If you like previous Feld games, this one is right in line.

●This was surprisingly a good game. I swear that I didn't even look this game twice after I watched a video review of it, or even read anything about it.
●I played my 1st game and overall, I really like this game! It's simple, plays quick (5 players under 45 minutes), and super tricky with the conflict that you have between players. I don't feel that it's that deep but still, I like it for how simple it is.

2015-07-31 : The heart of the game is the rather stylish, tense and very interactive bidding/auction mechanic. The graphics and layout are so well down that it's a breeze to see what other people have and will be going for, which adds to the excitement and screwage factor of the game. Plays very fast and has multiple avenues to victory. Feels like classic eurogame. Second best Feld game (after Trajan) by a mile. A second game only confirmed our initial impression.

Feld adds to his collection of games where something bad may happen to you if you let it.  Eaten by rats, felled by pestilence, now burned by fire.  This seems a tad more balanced than Notre Dame and ITYOTD in that respect, in that it seems harder to win if you completely ignore the ill fate.

The auction mechanism is clever, but the game feels way too truncated.  Reminds me a bit of Homesteaders, but I like that one a lot more.

(Rating includes expansion: [thing=78750]Kaispeicher[/thing]. Rating also based on 50+ asynch online plays on Yucata.de [microbadge=19345])

Fast-paced auction game that uses worker placement. I don't usually enjoy auctions that much, but here it's done in a clever way. You use workers, so you have a fixed amount of bets and the auctions don't drag on and on.

The expansion improves the game drastically by making it more interactive through special abilities you can auction for. It also introduces an additional auction that is handled slightly differently.

Plus, the expansions upgrades the cardboard coins to metal coins! That really makes a difference! (I think they even started to add them to the base game now.)

An excellent 45-minute game where every decision is important (not a very granular game). The way the auctions are implemented is very unique. Underrated!

Stefan Feld is one of my favorite designers, so I was very interested to try The Speicherstadt, a game I hadn't heard much about. I was very pleasantly surprised by it. I enjoy auction games, but am sometimes frustrated by how long they can take with thoughtful players as there are normally so many options when choosing if to bid, and if so, how much. This game remedies this issue with its unique mechanism for "bidding" on cards that come up for auction each round, all handled by where and in which order you place your markers over each available card. The first person to put a marker over a card will have the first chance to buy the card, but every marker placed in turn above it increases the price by a dollar. With money being pretty tight in this game, it often occurs that the person with the first chance to buy can't buy because the price is too expensive. The game plays in under an hour with lots of interesting decisions, but not debilitating ones, as there are only 3 markers to place each round, and there are a limited number of rounds (play until the cards run out). The only reason I don't rate this game higher is because each decision is very important - maybe even too important. I would enjoy it more if it was a little more granular with not so much riding on whether I get this card or that card. But this is a very solid game that I will enjoy exploring for months to come.

Enjoyed my plays on yucata.de a lot and we don't have an auction based game, so this would be a good addition.

After having played it with Lewis @ the cast are dice, I think i could be a little too ruthless for regular plays at home, as it's all about blocking and making things more expensive for others.

Buen juego con una mecánica original de "subasta invertida" por llamarlo de alguna manera, que es la esencia del juego. Con nuestros trabajadores iremos pujando en un mercado de cartas que se va encareciendo a medida que se completan las pujas y en el que el orden de colocación es vital para comprar estratégicamente. Es muy bonito, con el trabajo de Menzel excepcional, como siempre, y agradable de jugar, aunque concretamente en mi caso he llegado a quemarlo de tanto que lo jugamos al principio (tengo anotadas unas 13 partidas en 6 meses) y hoy día no me apetece demasiado jugarlo.

Dic'15 - Lo bajo de 8 a 7'5 por la pereza que me da jugarlo desde hace tiempo. Lo quemamos a lo largo de este año y desde el verano me cuesta mucho sacarlo a mesa, a pesar de que a Reyes y Juan Antonio les encanta y lo jugarían mucho más.

This is a really great card game, and that's coming from someone who doesn't like many card games.

I like the mechanism for acquiring the cards which is very tactical.  Money is open so players will constantly check other players money v position on the board to try and double guess the potential costs and destinations of the cards.

The cards are well illustrated and the game does look rather good layed out, complete with the small auction board and wooden resources.

The auction mechanism is interesting but doesn't quite work for me, as it's really unclear how you should play given how much you value a tile. Moreover, it's really dependent on how the others play and mistakes by your opponents can make the game too hard for one player and too easy for another. Moreover, the firefighter are too important to be ignored and you need at least a complete game to discover that -- so in your first game you're likely to take a beating. Moreover, the game seems too short to make it possible to build a strategy on other types of tiles, you basically react to what you can get.

Maybe with more plays and experience players this become more interesting, I'd be willing to try it again to find out.

Players are merchants in Hamburg's warehouse district trying to get rich, mostly by fulfilling trade contracts. To that end there is a shared pool of cards each turn. These include goods shipments, contracts, firemen used to protect against the occasional fire and a couple of special actions. The game is centered around how you get those cards (which actually feels more like a twist on worker placement than a bidding system to me).

There are basically two ways to acquire cards: Either you get in line early which means nobody can take the card away from you. It may become expensive, however, depending on how many other players have their eyes on it, too, since each additional worker in the queue behind you raises the price. Therefore you can also wait for the others to line up first and queue up after them which means you will get the card for cheap - but only if noone before you decides to buy it.

Of course, going first here means you cannot be sure to get any card for cheap, and sometimes there are no useful cards at all on the table. In addition, whenever a fire happens the player with the best firefighters gains points while the worst player loses the same amount. While there is nothing wrong with an additional way to score (in fact, the game probably needs one) the spread here (up to +/-5 while the biggest contracts score 11) is really large while being only marginally connected to the theme. I also suspect that there isn't overly much variation and plays will start to run along the same lines before too long.

The thing about [thing=66505][/thing], is that it is a 3-player game. *Only*. (Though, I haven't tried it 2-player yet...)

The other thing is that everyone needs to understand the deck and season composition, as well as all of the ways things hang together.

My first few games were meh, at best. But once I figured out what the issues were, and took care of them, it has really started shining. 

It's not my favorite Feld, but it *is* a great little super-filler for 3, along the lines of [thing=491][/thing].

If you put the prep-work in, and give it a shot (with on-the-ball players), I think you might be pleasantly surprised.

(I'm also quite looking forward to putting the expansion into play, once I have a base of decent players.)

The Speicher... whatever, is a great example of a Euro gateway. Bidding, resource conversions, victory points, obtuse German theme. But it all works. Simple to learn but weighty decisions. Definitely lucky things happening here in terms of card order and blind goods draw, but this one still retains its Euro goodness while the luck doesn't ever really get in the way. I enjoy all the mechanics and the artwork. Not very deep, but the bidding system is one I quite enjoy and creates a sort of tension that doesn't appear in other bidding games I know. I wish I had the expansion as this game could use a little additional something.  That being said, this is as filler as Feld is going to get for me! So there's a place in my collection.

Really bad with 2.  Hate it.

Not good with 5.

Thankfully we kept trying and found that it is good with 4.  Nice little middle-weight euro.  

Haven't tried it with 3, but one of my geekbuddies says that it is exclusively a 3-player game.

This simple, elegant, little game really caught me by suprise. Not only its mechanics are extremely easy to learn, but also its strategy is quite clear. The heart of the game is the auction mechanism, which is one of the most fun (and brutal!) I ever experienced. Components are of good quality and Menzel's artwork is as usual very detailed and lovely. I really can't recommend this little gem enough. Now, I'm eager to try Kaispeicher, the big expansion.

Excellent game! The supposedly dry theme interests the heck out of me. The St. Michaelis church card, for instance, pictures a church that overlooks the actual warehouse in reality. Neat! In typical Stephan Feld fashion, play is cutthroat and there's stiff punishment for making wrong moves. Nonetheless, it still manages to be a fun affair, where players can feel the accomplishment of buying goods, filling contracts, and putting out fires.

RATING: 7.7
Reminded me of Wallace's London except with auctions.  The auctions keep everyone involved leaving no room for any down time.  Money is extremely tight and there's no option for loans. An equal number of cards per player available each round make the few decisions you have agonizingly important; but doesn't lend itself to AP.  I like the push your luck that's including with the random timing of the fires.
Played only 2 player games so far.  So my rating will most likely go up after having a chance to play with 3 or 4. 
Seemed fairly balanced with just 2.  I wonder about a few cards being a little too strong though.  And the fire penalty in a 2 player game can make for some big point swings. 

UPDATE: Played several 3 player games with the Kaispeicher expansion. I liked how the game played with 2; but the design just lends itself to be better with more. I was completely taken by how well it played with 3. The new cards and extra card row with the expansion take Speicherstadt from being a very good game to being damn awesome! You can teach it in 5 minutes and it has a pretty slim learning curve too. Plenty of choices; but without any overwhelming AP brain burn. 
Think 4 would be just as good if not maybe a little bit better.
Not interested in playing with only 2 players again and I don't think I'd like it with 5 as much. Even though you most likely use less workers, it would seem to add too much time to the game. 3-4 seems to be the sweet spot.

This is a game kind of like Ra--a game that kind of doesn't feel like a game. It's simply bid for cards, try to fulfill contracts or get sets, and try not to get Feld-punished. I think this is a Feld that is worth owning or at least someone in a game group should have. It provides some great decisions and the auction mechanic is simple and ingenious. 

On the flip side, I could see this one becoming a bit stale. However, I don't know how I feel about the Kaispeicher expansion: it introduces a lot of specialty cards that detract from the game from what I've experienced. Maybe the game is best as is as long as you have 4-5 players.

An adequate but minor game from the prolific Stefan Feld.

Die Speicherstadt has gotten a lot of play in our group, but I've usually tried to get in the "other game." I guess the game is mildly clever, but it's also shallow, fragile, and bland. Your success seems too tightly bound to how much the others bid you up.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Not bad, but weak theme and too dry and boring mechanics. The scarceness of money is part of the game but gives few options and worst with the game is that all workers you can't use for positive results, you will use to destroy for somebody else and this is often a common choice. This makes it a worse game IMHO.

RATING: 7.5
Enjoying this more and more with each play. Multiple ways to score allow you to explore new strategies with each play (contracts and ships, money strategy, firemen, counting offices and VP buildings). Learning how the deck is set up will unlock new ways to value each card. The order that the cards come out from game to game will make a difference as well.

Money is VERY tight, meaning tough choices about when to buy and when to let a card pass by will be important. The tactical placement of your workers is unique in this game, creating some very meaningful and enjoyable decisions.

I would say the game plays best with 3. The deck is too small for a 4 player game to feel very strategic (I enjoy it with 4 but have no desire to play with 5). The 2 player game is great as well, but you do lose some of the interesting bidding that comes with the 3 player game. You make up for that, however, by accomplishing more throughout the game (i.e. buying more goods, contracts, firemen, etc.), which is always fun.

Bidding games aren't my favorite genre, but this is a good one. The game is very well designed. Money and points are very tight. I like that I don't have to try and calculate the optimum amount to bid for things (like in Power Grid). It's more about figuring out what you and your opponents can afford and maximizing your opportunities and minimizing theirs.

I thought i would really like this since I have enjoyed the majority of Stefan Feld's designs. I'm sure there's strategy and depths not apparent on initial plays but it just kind of fell flat when we played and left me with zero desire to explore it any further. I should give it another go though.

RATING: 6
In spite of its HORRIBLE name, Die Speicherstadt has some interesting elements and a very tense bidding/purcdhase phase.  There are numerous factors and alternatives to consider, most of which must take into account the possible actions of one's opponents. Players usually have a very limited number of coins to spend on the numerous cards they covet.  Opponents will often place representatives on the same card, driving up the cost if a player desires to purchase it.  If the player declines, they will then have the opportunity to make the purchase.  Players must also constantly assess the financial situation of their opponents, as they can often increase the price of a card beyond what an opponent(s) can afford.  Further, there are numerous categories of cards players would ideally like to acquire.  Funds, however, are limited, and the keen competition for these cards will usually force players to concentrate on just a few types.  All of these considerations and factors make this phase of the game shine.

The biggest drawback is that each game feels much like the previous one.  There isn’t a lot of variety in the cards, and due to the deck preparation, they will appear in roughly the same order each game.  Further, each game is relatively short, and there isn't much time to build an effective engine to supply needed income.  If you happen to be short on cash for a turn or two when needed cards appear, your plans can be irreparably destroyed.  The game may benefit from a greater variety of cards and perhaps an extra turn or two.

RATING: 4.5
This is one of those games built around a single mechanic. In this case, it's an acquisition system similar to that of "Felinia", but not so good, much more chaotic, although there are some tactics. After my first game, with five players, I was underwhelmed. My impression was that there simply wasn't enough time to do much, the economy was a bit too tight, and there was a general lack of control. The end result felt somewhat random. I played a second game with four and it was slightly better.

RATING: 7
The mechanics are simple to learn, but the dynamics of each auction bid are little complicated, because it depends precisely on how many coins each person has, what goods they need, how many fireman they have, and so on.  The coin factor is very tricky -- sometimes you want to add a second bid right next to your previous bid to make something cost 3 instead of 2 (to someone ahead of you who only has 2 coins).  But sometimes you want to let them win it for 2 coins, so they won't have any money to spend on future bids in that round.

I first played this with 3 players, and the analysis was difficult.  I later played with 5 players, and it seemed a little easier somehow... it's not possible to keep track of everybody's motivations, and bids got higher, so you just have to take your chances and pick a strategy.

One hint is not to underestimate the value of the Warehouse -- having the flexibility to hold goods and later buy a contract that matches them is a great thing.  Also, thee are no new contracts in the D deck, so you'd better use up your goods earlier and not bid on on more if you can't use them.

RATING: 8
Kind of like an auction game where each card scores a bit differently. It reminded me a little bit of Ra in that way. Instead of a straight auction, you bid by putting your guys out on the items. The sooner you bid, the more certain it is you can buy, but the more likely the price will rise when others jump in with their guys. Not bad at all, and seems well balanced, although the very specific deck setup might make games similar after a while.

Interesting bidding mechanism and tight gameplay. Good design, but not for me. Too tight, too mean, too much counting other people's money, and messing them over. If you like playing highly competitive that's great, I don't enjoy it.

Regarding theme I prefer Speicherstadt over its Vikings reimplementation "Jórvík" or its uniqueness.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
This seemingly bland concept is actually brought to life as a well-considered and well-themed game, which is all about the small pile of coins you have, and how to make the most of them, without running yourself so low that you risk missing the next important auction.

The simple cost decreases (per potential buyer), and extremely simple currency model make for some complicated decisions.  

Add to this the more realistic penalty model (Fires breaking out in the Warehouses require Firemen, VERY sought-after Firemen- he who contributes most gains, he that contributes least...), and Feld has actually chosen a theme which is not mere dressing but which really truly mirrors another of his clever games.

This one is more than worth the $20 plus shipping it currently might run a buyer. I've played once and can easily see it hitting the table again shortly.

This is one of Feld's best games, I will certainly start this at a 7.25 (after 1 solo 3-player game), and expect it to climb with additional plays. NOTE: Increased to 7.5 after a 2nd 4-player solo game.

This was a Geekway to the West 2010 Play-to-Win. It is an extremely stripped down Euro, where it boils it down to the essentials, sort of like Endeavor. The novel mechanic is placement of your workers, similar to Leonardo Da Vinci, where position and number of workers for a given spot earns the player to execute some action. There are contracts to be bought and fulfilled, by acquiring various goods.

This is the problem I have with stripped down Euros: while I appreciate the designer's intent to get to the purity of gameplay, the theme is inconsequential. I end up focusing on optimizing the mechanics, and not caring about the theme or emotional investment. It's like solving one of those wooden puzzles. As a pure intellectual exercise, one could find this enjoyable, but as a social activity? Meh.

I don't know why I rated this a '5' initially. It's a '2'.

[開始遊戲]
玩家們輪流當起始玩家，金屬圓幣是起始玩家指示物，回合結束時將它交給下一個玩家。
遊戲分成若干回合(2/3/4/5人分別有16/12/10/8回合)，每回合有五個階段：

第一階段：供給(Supply)
根據玩家人數翻不同張數(2/3/4/5人翻出3/4/5/6張)卡片，放在版圖上面的空格，若翻出
貨運船則立即從袋子隨機拿出三個貨物放上去，若翻出失火則立即結算失火得失分，然後
棄掉失火卡片，重新補一張。(貨運船和失火都是B時期以後才會出現，A時期沒有)

※失火
比較玩家所拉攏(買到)的消防隊員能力值加總，最高的玩家可得到失火卡片上面數字的分
數，最低的玩家則必須扣失火卡片上面數字的分數，若平手則都加分或扣分，但若"所有"
玩家的消防隊員能力值加總皆相同，則沒有人要加分或扣分。

第二階段：排隊(Demand)
從起始玩家開始輪流放一個工人在任一卡片上的建築物，必須放在該建築物最低的樓層，
進行三輪之後進入第三階段。(一個玩家可以派二個以上的工人去同一個建築排隊)

第三階段：購買(Purchase)
由左邊第一張卡片開始詢問，最低樓層的工人有優先購買權，若願意購買則必須付目前排
隊人數的錢(包括自己，所以最少就是一塊，付的錢給銀行)，將卡片買走，其它剩下的工
人鎩羽而歸，若不願意則收回工人，由下一個工人遞補，若所有人都不願意購買或沒人排
隊就棄掉那張卡片。同樣步驟依序處理剩餘的卡片。

第四階段：卸貨(Loading)
如果有買到貨運船，則必須處理上面的貨物，有幾種選擇
1.若有拉攏(買到)到貿易商，對應的貨可以一個賣一元。(賣掉的貨放到貨物區)
2.若有拿到合約，可以把需要的貨物擺在合約上對應的位置。
3.賣任意二個貨換一元。(賣掉的貨放到貨物區)
4.用任意三個貨交換一個貨物區的貨。(不是和袋子裡的換)
5.將貨儲藏在交易所(market hall)(只能存一個)，或是儲藏到倉庫(可以存4個)，儲藏的
  貨可供之後使用。

※有多的貨無法處理則棄掉放進貨物區。

第五階段：收入(Income)
每人拿一元(有銀行的玩家拿二元)，這回合沒買到卡的人拿二元(有銀行的玩家拿三元)。


ABCD四個時期的卡片會剛好用完，最後一回合動作完畢後進行E時期失火結算，然後遊戲就
結束算分。


[卡片介紹] (總數:A/B/C/D)
  貿易商( 5:5/0/0/0)：五種貨物各一張，對應的貨一個可賣一元，遊戲結束時得一分。
    合約(10:3/3/4/0)：完成合約遊戲結束時可獲得上面的分數，沒完成不算分。
  消防員(10:2/3/2/3)：有不同能力值，失火時結算用。
    倉庫( 1:1/0/0/0)：可儲藏四個貨物供使用，遊戲結束時若上面有貨每個可得一分。

Interesting bidding mechanism:
Everyone places a meeple one at a time in front of the card they want to buy until everyone has placed all their meeples. Then there will be lines of meeples in front of each card. 

The price of the card is the amount of meeples currently there. First person in line can decide if they want to buy it or not. If they don't, they take their meeple back and the second person has the option to buy at a slightly cheaper price. 

Money is stupid tight in this game by the way. Usually you'd do well buying 1-2 cards per round. I got a bit irritated at the meeple price jostling. (though I generally don't like auctiony games.)

RATING: 5
A functional but decidedly dull game (at least with two players - I suspect it's somewhat better with more). The expansion allegedly improves it a great deal. Without the expansion there's just very little to it.

Not Feld's finest hour.

Just played with money hidden. Had too much guessing for my taste. I would rather be able to make the strategic play based on the amount of money my opponents have. But hidden money does follow the theme better.

Played twice in one week. Once with 4, once with 3. Both plays were excellent. Such a simple game, but tough decisions throughout.

Light, but it's awfully tricky.  The bidding system is very unusual; you can get in line to bid but must pay more the more people are in line behind you.  This makes it quite difficult to predict what will happen, even though it feels as if there should be enough information to do so.  (2 plays)

A www.yucata.de offering.

Just a trial play with 2 so far.

Clever little worker placement / auction mechanic.

My suspicion from an initial play is that it is likely a game whose mechanics shine a little brighter with 3, 4 or 5 players (rather than just with 2).

Worth another play to find out.

A very innovative worker placement game. Worker cost is determined by how many workers on the lineup. The game is very competitive. The game mechanics outbreak struggles against each other.

[b]2 Player Review:[/b] 

Simply put, the best auction game I`ve ever played. All you do is bid smartly on resources to artificially rise the price on something someone else wants, or maneuver yourself into a position to get something for as cheap as possible. The use of the resources is resolved quickly and is a fun little puzzle in its own right. It plays really well with two people and is good to keep around if you ever have more to play with. 

[b]Expansion Review:[/b] 

We were lucky to track down an English copy of the expansion in Spain, that arrived 8th Feb 2014, in the middle of a blizzard. We fell in love with it immediately. It adds so much depth to an already tense, flawless bidding game. The brilliant new additions such as the Snitch, Coffee Break, Squad Leader, Press, and many more, add an incredible new layer of strategy. A standing ovation for Stefan Feld. He`s created an expansion that the game would never be the same without. 

[b]Pros:[/b]

- The amazing expansion
- Base game plays quickly, almost twice as long with the expansion
- You [i]MUST[/i] anticipate what your partner is planning 
- Great sense of tension right until the end
- Several strategies to victory
- Incredibly easy to explain, but plays like a medium-weight Euro.

[b]Cons:[/b]

- Might feel repetitive to some people as only one action type (bidding) is taken each turn
- Some people might get frustrated when they get blocked on an item that their partner clearly does not need

Auction: set collection: screwage

This game desperately needed the expansion out of the gate to make a game out of it, and my rating reflects that (have Exp as 6) Without it and only having one area to contest it really was only half a game imo anyway, really a filler barely worth playing.

With the expansion and one other whole area now playable, it’s a decent filler but still not that great to me, and I really don’t like the dirt cards in the game, they are "one-off’s" but to me the screwage just doesn't fit the rest of the game. The interesting part of the game is the whole angst of wanting to go on something, but then knowing that if you do, others are going to likely come afterwards and make it much more expensive, really that is the only hook here, but it does its job well.

RATING: 3
Only played once (09OCT10) with 5 players although I have been wanting to play for months.

So much angst with only 3 meeple placements per round and with "perfect information" about every other players assets/position and despite that we had minimal AP!

Key seems to be cash flow which is VERY tight in the game and firemen of course. But a very good game and looking forward to playing again.

MAR11 Second play was a worse experience! I just do not "get" this game at all (and find it no fun!). Traded away.

Rating after 1 game with 5 players... as others have commented this is likely a better game with fewer players were you have more control.  Though as also others have mentioned there is likely also a re-playability problem as there are the same cards each game... unlike Macao where different cards come out each game and you can absolutely not depend on certain cards coming out.  Maybe the expansion addresses that?

update: been 4.5 years since 1st play... 2nd play was with just 4... liked it a little better, would now like to try with just 3 players.

update: tried with 5 players... was brutal... very hard to get ships!

Initial Rating: 8.0 (April 2012)

A good Feld. As usual the theme is paper thin but the game mechanics make for some interesting and hard decisions. Basically, The Speicherstadt is a bidding game, a mechanic I thoroughly enjoy so I like the game. The game components are pretty nice, the coins are very good looking, however the board seems unnecessary to me. It plays fairly quick. 

The money in the game is very scarce (I like this). I liked it very much at the beginning, however, nowadays, the game doesn’t excite me as before, so I’m downgrading its rating. Still I consider it a good game. 

Bottom line, a lighter Feld than usual, but one I like to play from time to time. Perhaps I will buy it in the future.

Suffered from a bit too much run-away leader for my tastes.  Like the theme but it isn't really in the gameplay.

This is an interesting bidding game in which placing a worker behind another player drives up the cost. There are also some cards that once you place a worker on no one can compete for the card, but the players going after that card type drive up the cost of the previous players. You never have to buy a card. Cards can give you resources, do resource conversion, score victory points, or as firemen help you gain victory points when fires come out. It's another Feld game that I really enjoy.

Speicherstadt is one of these games with a single idea that carries the game. In this case, it's a promising one. The trick is that there are multiple simultaneous auctions and players "bid" on one of them by placing one of their workers there. The price for the card rises with each additional worker placed with the first player having the privilege to buy first. If he declines he removes his worker and the following player can buy the card for one less.
It's an interesting mechanism warranting a few games to work it out. I'm not sure though if it is possible to consistently being in for the win. My feeling is that it is possible to be hosed completely without any fault just because things work out against you incidentally.

I wavered a long time on this game before pulling the trigger.  There were so many comments about this just being a middling euro or JASE or whatever they're calling it these days.

But I guess it turns out that that's not always a negative thing.  I really like a lot of the classic simple auction games.  The ladder mechanism here is kind of fun, trying to figure out people's breaking points or simply just making them pay more.

It plays quickly, is very tight money-wise, and just feel familiar and fun.  So nothing groundbreaking, but solid.

A game with constant lack of money. I enjoyed the auction mechanics - a card costs depends on the number of meeples behind you. First in the queu has the ability to buy first, but the last one has the lowest price. Of course, for a better opinion, more plays are needed.

Žaidimas, kuriame nuolat trūksta pinigų. Man patiko aukcionų mechanika - kortos kaina tokia, kiek už tavęs stovi žmogeliukų. Pirmas turi pirmumo teisę pirkti, bet paskutinis - mažesnę kainą. Žinoma, tvirtesnei nuomonei reikia daugiau pažaisti.

Excellent auction game. I think this would be more of an 8 for me if it wasn't so light. Great Feld game that shows that the man can craft a gem of a game, even with such simplicity. Out of the box, you can be playing this game within minutes. Take turns placing one of your 3 guys on an auction track for a certain card. The lowest level has the right of first refusal, but must pay coins based on the number of occupants on the track. If they refuse, the second person has the option to purchase the card, but again the price being based on the number of occupants still left on the track. This can create some interesting events. Position is key in this game. I will need to play it a few more times to get an idea of how the pacing works with juggling commodity traders, ships, and contracts. Want to buy this one for sure!

Has all the markings of a great game. Simple rules, short playtime, lots of choices, interesting bidding mechanism and a good amount of player interaction. The game has a nice amount of screwage and players cannot ignore the loss of points to fire (it can be a 20 point difference on fire alone). Money is extremely tight so having funds at the right time is important. Also, due to the deck being almost the exact same size regardless of player count, gameplay is quite different with each size group.

Disappointing auction card game. Bid for cards and collect coins & cubes to turn these in victory points. Typical Feld, make sure to avoid the negative event. After rats and disasters in his previous games, you'll have to "collect" firemen in this one to prevent loosing points due to the fire which happens in each season (except the first). Nothing really new or exciting. Not a lot of control. Not a good game. Positive: it is a short game, so the agony doesn't last too long.

A cute game, quick to play, but somewhat of a 1-trick pony.  Once you get over the clever meeple placement-cost thing, there's not much else in there.

I'm a total Feld fan, but this is one of his weaker game.  The title and theme are also quite unfortunate.  I'm told the expansion does a lot for the game.

Another "who cares?" euro with nothing to recommend it except an "innovative" auction system that doesn't disguise the fact that you're using it to just bid on the same stupid junk as in every other euro. Please stop making this game.

A simple action of bidding makes this game easy to learn, but who the strategy on what to bid for an when to pass is outstanding!  While this can be played with two, I can't imagine how fun that would be.  Played with four last night and it was an awesome time with the final results placing the winner only 6 points ahead of the person who finished last.  Very close!

6.5: As a two player game, it doesn't feel quite balanced. Though it looks promising with more players.

7.1: with three players. The firemen were still a strong deciding factor. But overall, I do like the game with it's bidding technique.

7.6: With 4 or more players, it's more balanced.

I had lots of trouble figuring out the game initially. but after the first 2 rounds, you sort of figure it out as well as the actual value of the coins (which are very valuable). By then I was already looking forward to the next game; I like the game mechanics and you really need to think about your opponent's actions as well in order to get the cards that you want. The interaction is always good whenever there is a tight bidding element in a game.

RATING: 5
The auction system is not as cool as it appears. Like most auctions, it's fragile, everyone has to 'police' each other to make sure nobody gets an amazing deal. Here, you do that by placing your pawns in line to drive up the price for whoever's at the front of the line. So it's literally 'take that.' 

There is room for some smart plays, for example if A has 2 coins and B has 1, and the line is AB, then C can place (ABC) and take it for 1 coin as both A and B are incapable of paying their new prices of 3 and 2. 

A key weakness of the game - and perhaps a key fact to understanding the game - is that every time you place a pawn, regardless of when/where you place it, you are offering to buy the card for [b]1 coin[/b]. It's people [i]after[/i] you who can make it more expensive. Thus, you effectively have [i]no control[/i] over the price you're offered - other players control this, and the only choice you get is whether to pay the price [i]they[/i] have decided. This is what makes the game very fragile. If other players take it easy on you, you WILL win.

I love the bidding mechanic in this game.  It is so tense.  Lots of bluffing/guesswork on what everyone else is going to do provide indirect player interaction.  Plays quickly, with multiple paths to scoring victory points.  I hope this one has legs, because I am really enjoying it.

I did enjoy this, but the number of bids you can make was so tight I felt there was not quite enough to the game. I think the tightness is probably meant to be the whole point of the game, but it also meant it lacked something for me. I would happily play it again though.

I have played it again. I do like it, but it is so tight and frustrating I will play it but do not want to own it. Kind of a love/hate thing.

6.5 rating for game without the Kaispeicher expansion... with I'd rate it a 5.5, at least with 5 players... too chaotic, the cards above the board dismantle a lot of what is interesting on the board from the base game.

RATING: 7
A simple auction game where you have a certain number of "workers" to bid based on turn order.  You can "bid" on different cards and the last player to place on a card can buy it but must buy for an amount equal to the number of workers placed there.  As people pass on it, it becomes cheaper.  You are trying to get cards to gather resources to satisfy orders.  

The game only has certain cards come out in different seasons.  It can be a little difficult on new players.  I have heard that expansion makes this game better but have not played.  Since, I find it a very solid, family weight auction game.

Enjoyable auction game. Would like to get a copy of it and it's expansion. Played a few times, and a few dozen times on yucata.de. However the Jorvik reprint and it's theme doesn't appeal for some reason. Also for a small game it's way overpriced.

RATING: 7
This is a hidden gem. I bought it for about $15 largely on the basis of loving Stefan Feld's games, and expected it to wind up being a 7. One play revealed it to be a 9.

It's not what it seems: the muted colors and understated graphic design coupled with the "trading stuff in Germany...again" theme make it look like it's going to be just another Euro. It's not. It's incredibly cutthroat, and we found ourselves swearing, shaking our fists, and groaning in frustration throughout the game

The heart of it is the bidding -- that's really the game. You rarely have enough money, there aren't enough turns to really build an engine, and a huge amount of your strategy is going to be determined by your cagey play in the bidding round.

The bidding is vicious. Even if you have no money, you can set out to make everyone else pay dearly for what you want -- and if you do have enough money, the round feels totally different. There are some fun lucky moments when you wind up with a great card for 1 coin, and it's not hard to discern some basic strategies even on the first play.

I thought the cards might be overwhelming during game one, but they weren't at all. The rulebook is well-designed, and it's easy to go over the cards as they come up. The graphic design is also fantastic, rarely requiring a rules reference after you've seen something once.

On top of all of that, the components are great (I love the shiny money) and this game packs a huge amount of action, tension, turn angst, and thought into about 45 minutes. That's a hell of an accomplishment.

Truly a hidden gem, and a great game that I'm proud to own.

+ Kaispeicher expansion

Rating based on 3-5 players.

Simple auction rules produce a gloriously mean (but in a fun way!) game. 

Expansion comments: The Kaispeicher expansion lengthens the game and makes it a wee bit more point-salady (and a little less mean, because not every sale is contested), and it's hard to decide if the game actually improves with it, or just changes. In any case, the metal coins are lovely to clink as you ponder your move.

I traded Raiders of the North Sea for this--a game I enjoyed quite a bit. I made that trade because Speicherstadt looked like a special game, a game that would be fresh and incredibly well-designed.

Why in the heck do I suck so badly at this game! :-)

Played several times with 3, 4, and 5 and prefer 3 or 4.  I always feel screwed by the player to my left.  Feels like they always just go behind me wherever I place my meeple.  Don't get the zen of the game yet or something.  Don't ignore those firemen. You can afford to lose once or twice in the early rounds but playing catch up is very hard. Money can be very tight.

Excellent game. Great auction system, quick play, and those decisions are so hard because of tight money and competition.

5 players get very few rounds and 2 have a long time to battle it out. You almost need a play or two to re-calibrate after changing player counts.

The Bank card is always powerful, but more so in the 2-player game. There are just so many more rounds to collect.

We have been introducing the Speicherstadt like crazy and just bought two copies to give as gifts.

You can get the Speicherstadt for a great price and it is worth it.

Clever and fairly quick auction game.  The auction mechanic itself is cool, basically you're placing workers for the right to buy an item (card).  After worker placement you go through the lots one by one.  The first to place over a card can buy the card but pays the number of workers over that card.  If a player doesn't want to buy a card (or cannot afford it) the next player above the card can purchase it.  It's now 1 cheaper, since a worker has been removed from the card.

Money is hard to come by but just having it may be enough to intimidate others from placing over you since you also don't have many workers to place.  Most the cards available are ships carrying goods and contracts which must be completely filled by the goods requested, on it, to gain points.

There's a fireman mechanic too.  When a fire breaks out in the warehouse district players count up their fireman values, won in previous auctions, and whomever has the most gets points, the least loses points.  Having played this a few times I must say knowing the card distribution is very important as you really need to pick and choose your battles and drive prices up when you can to make sure people don't get cheap awards.

I'd play it, probably.

It is all in the bidding. You set a round of cards out and everyone plays down a worker. This is done three times, then whether or not to buy the card happens. Players either choose to buy or pass. Buying is the number of workers on the card, if you pass the cost decreases by one and the next player can choose to buy or pass, etc. until all the cards are bought.

Surprisingly fun for being such a cut-and-dry auction game. The bidding is certainly interesting, and money is always in short supply. Not to mention that you want almost every card that comes out each round. Excellent game all around.

I prefer this to Spyrium, which uses a similar worker placement/area control/bidding aspect.

UPDATE: Got rid of this with the hopes that Jorvik will be a better game...it is. Granted I like the graphic design here better, Jorvik comes with the expansion built-in, which fleshes this game out considerably.

美術:0.5
美術是這款遊戲的敗點，配件要等擴充的金屬硬幣的出現才真正的有價值感，其他如卡牌美術、圖板、配件都不算精美，尤其擴充中，遊戲卡片還會被擺在圖板外，怎麼擴充自己不跟著出補充圖板呢?(很多遊戲擴充都有出補充圖板--例如村莊)假如美術在精美一點，就太棒了!

互動強烈，每一步都是步步驚心，常常互相陷害後，發現自已一無所得，鑽進了紅海的死胡同。這次本遊戲最精華的地方。整個遊戲過程你會發現"怎麼自己想要的牌都有人在卡位"，"怎麼大家都針對我"的這種莫名其妙的迫害感。

A great Feld design, the auction mechanic here is brilliantly done, and the way the number of cards adapt to each player count means no matter how many players you have, the game plays in pretty much the same length of time.  Agonising decisions often, which makes for a great, tense game.  Superb.

RATING: 7
In Hamburg, 1900, the Speicherstadt represents the warehouse district. Each round, there are 4 cards up for purchase, representing ships, fireman, contracts and other cards. Each player has 3 meeples. You place a meeple over a card, forming a column of meeples as other players can place on top of your meeple. The cost of the card is the number of meeples in the column. 

This mechanic can be considered tough, as your opponents can place above you to make your card more expensive or deny you the card. The fireman amelioriate the effects of fire. 

It's a fun game and has a lot of angst, especiallly if you run out of money and your opponents stack their meeples on top of yours.

The bidding mechanism is very fragile - games can be won or lost on a single placement by a bad or ignorant player. I also found the actual bidding to be quite a boring exercise, and since the game is little more than this one mechanism, I will gladly let this game fade into obscurity.

RATING: 8
A pretty simple game with agonizing decisions on every bid.  Plays quickly, easy to teach, and deceptively deep.'

Players take turns placing meeples on cards they want to purchase starting from the bottom and going up.  After placing payment starts, the person on the bottom gets first choice, counts up the pieces on top of him and decides if he will pay the amount of pieces on top of him for the card.  If he does not, the next player does the same until the card is bought or left to rot.

Throughout the game you will notice some cards work together and firemen cards prevent you from losing points while your opponents lose points.

RATING: 6
Really a very fast Feld, even faster than Notre Dame. Perhaps the first 5-6 Felds I learned were his longest ones? Anyway, this one goes quickly but feels like it would get repetitive after a couple plays because of the limited number of cards and limited number of things to do with them. It doesn't smack much of the Feldian 8-different-things-one-can-do-on-a-turn. On the plus side, the auction element lends itself to bluffing.

Another worker placement game with a twist. each additional worker placed next to an item (a card) raises the price the original worker needs to pay for it. If the original worker declines to pay, the next in line can purchase but now the price is lowered. Cards bring goods, orders for goods, VPs, money - the usual stuff.
it's an ok game, but nothing special. Most of the Feld games have better ideas implemented.

It's one of Feld's light games, based on a worker placement mechanism that creates a bidding system to get cards. It makes the game elegant and fast.

OK game, but commodity speculation + auction games are not really my favourite kind.
The aution method is the same as in Felinia: the more meeples in the queue interested in an item, the more expensive it gets. Finally you can choose either to pay the item´s price or just pass without buying it, which lowers the price by one money unit for the next player in the queue.

RATING: 7
A bit of a change of pace considering Stefan Feld's penchant for intricate clockwork, Die Speicherstadt is a relatively simple blend of auctions, resource management and a simple supply and demand principle - cards with different meanings (merchandise, firemen, buildings) are auctioned and the price of each card rises according to the amount of bidders: the first bidder pays the full price, if they turn down the purchase the next bidder can buy for one coin less and so on. 

The goal is obviously to gather the most points fulfilling contracts; the resources for these contracts arrive in ships, coins have got to be saved during the game to pay for higher-prized cards and every once in a while there's a fire, so players must hire firemen. All by the book. Nevertheless, even though this game shows all the traits (clichés?) of Stefan Feld's celebrated creations and turns up a bit too repetitive for two players, it's more elegant than the average Feld fare. The games for three, four and five players encourage different sorts of speculation as well - there's more direct interaction this time around.

Un Feld poco noto. Il meccanismo ruota intorno ad un'asta all'olandese, originale perché non molto diffusa. Gioco di strategia molto gratificante.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Traders collect goods to fulfil contracts, which are worth points at game end. There are other special acquisitions that can also score, but the majority of the game concerns buying goods (sets of different coloured cubes, on cards) to complete contracts (sets of different coloured cubes, on cards). The most significant "other items" are firemen (they bought their own back then?) that can be worth many points at game end.
Each round a new set of contracts, cargos and other cards become available. These are laid out in a line beneath the board, which shows a row of warehouse buildings with windows up their fronts. Players bid for cards by placing workers in the first available window above. Subsequent players can place workers on the floor above that, forming columns of workers until all have been allocated. Then starting at the bottom left hand side, players decide whether or not to purchase. Cost is equal to the total number of workers in that column. If the first player declines, his worker is removed from the ground floor and the choice goes to the player whose worker is on the first floor. Eventually someone will make a purchase and the remaining workers in that column will not get to buy anything. Their efforts are not wasted, however, as they contributed to the cost paid by the buyer.
I am not wildly impressed- the game does not seem to offer a great deal of variety, each play is much the same. Die Speicherstadt is also a "tight" game financially; players need to squeeze the best out of every coin. Generally I like this, but Die Speicherstadt features one card that gives its owner bonus income every round. I have only played a little, but this seems to be a killer advantage.

Good simple game.  Set up and clean up are quick (few pieces).  Game play is quick without all the fiddliness of many newer games.  Can play in 30 to 45 minutes.  This is a job/role bidding game.  You get the job/role card for the rest of the game.  The interesting bit is the bidding.  You pay the amount based on the number of workers/bidding chits placed on each card.  You have limited money a lot of jockeying for position during the bidding.  The theme works well.  Good game.  A bit stronger than the typical filler game.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]I really wanted to play this again since I enjoyed my first play so much and had that chance earlier this week. I was really disappointed after playing again, this game is way to dry and mechanical when compared to other auction games that I enjoy (in fact in the same day we played 2 of them: Modern Art and Santiago).

I was really bored playing, there was zero excitement and tension. The fires don't do much to add tension to the game, they just become a hindrance for one player and can easily be avoided. Again this game is just boring and rote. Even the cards you try and collect are generic and obvious (one set of cards to sell each good for $, contracts to score vp, cards to score vp for $, boats or multiples of 1 building). 

I really don't know why you'd ever choose to play this game over the other amazing auction games out there (add Medici and Ra to the games I mentioned above). Playing 3 auction games in one day really made The Speicherstadt stand out as the inferior game and one I'd rather not play again.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]I can't wait to play this game again, I guess I really like auction games ([thing=12][/thing] and [thing=46][/thing] are also favorites of mine)[/i].

- Really tight auctions, every coin matters.
- Building an engine that will not only generate some income, but also score you points.
- This is an easy game to learn, but there is so much depth for such a simple game.
- The worker placement to determine the price of the card up for auction and determining bid order... perfect.
- Fires; yes they suck, but the firemen add another layer of tension to the auctions.[/i]

I really like the bidding mechanic, and I am not sure I totally figured out the best way to get what I want on the first play.  The biggest problem for me is the length of the game.  Since there is no building of an engine, and everything you buy is for instant gratification, it is a crap shoot as to when good stuff comes up and you have a bad position in the bidding order.  I would give it another try, but I feel all it has going for it is a interesting concept wrapped in an incomplete game.

RATING: 6
A dressed-up auction game, competing each round to acquire cards to earn you victory points. It features a new supply and demand mechanic, but it's closer to an extortion mechanic. N+1 cards go out and players rotationally place bids on the ones they want. You only get 3 bids (aka meeple placements) and the price you pay (or pass on) is equal to 1 + how many meeples get placed on the card subsequent to your meeple. With only 1 dollar per turn income, you don't often buy more than 1 card per turn, so naturally you place meeples where other meeples are, ramping up the price for them, effectively extorting them. If you’ve forced them to pass, you may them pick it up for the cheaper price. Or pass. Successful pus. Congratulations. Your mother must be so proud. A lot of the game boils down to a series of king-maker moves - do I ramp up the price on player A because they have the most money, or on player B because I wouldn't mind that card or player C because I think they're winning? Your strategy is to be left alone as much as possible, maybe going for card combinations less favoured by others. Results are sensitive to both card order and the pus decisions of others. There can be decisive late game point swings as well depending on the order of fire and fireman cards, and what cube combinations come out on the ship cards. In summary, the game is round after round of this auction mechanic, acquiring VP cards and the means to satisfy them. Which all plays ok, but it has an unsatisfactory fragilic dependency on how cards emerge and who people decide to pus.

Just got it (16/03/2012).

First play was awesome! Extremely tense and everybody was scratching their heads in trying to decide on what to do. After playing a lot of Stone Age where I'm used to scoring 200+ or even 300+ VPs I suddenly had to think small and scoring only 20+ points suddenly seems like a hell of a lot of work!

Only 3 meeples to place on board was like "what the fuck am I going to do with only 3 Meeples?!?!?!" managing these resources is great fun and figuring out how to make your opponents spend more money so that you get the advantage next round is great! :)

Best thing is that the game doesn't take long!

Stefan Feld è un autore interessante e prolifico, e mette in ogni sua creatura, anche piccola come questa, il suo marchio di fabbrica.
Non lasciatevi ingannare dalla scarsa dotazione di questo piccolo gioco: l'impianto delle regole è solido, semplice e senza pietà. Incendi più frequenti di quanto non si creda e scarsa disponibilità economica sono la costante di ogni partita, che scorre velocemente e senza tempi morti.

RATING: 7
This is a nifty little auction game that really pits the players against one another.  You can place a bid marker on a selection of cards, and other players can, in turn, place their bid markers on other cards, or above your marker on that card.  When everyone's done placing markers, the bids resolve, with the first player on a card given the first opportunity to buy it, but at a price equal to the number of bid markers there.  If the first player declines, then the next lowest bid marker is given the opportunity at that price minus one.  Money is both very tight and open, so players are always looking at other players and trying to figure out who will pay what for what.  It's a lot of fun.

BGG stands correct on this game. This game is not as fun in a 2-player setting. The end game point even went off the scoring track in our game. That only happened because in my 2-player game we played with the "positive  fireman scoring" variant. I can see fireman is more OP in a 2-player game if played with the normal rules. 

---- Update ----
Had two 3-player games under my belt and this is definitely a game for 3+ players. It's a great Feld title with 3+ players.

---- Update ----
Got two 4-player games under my belt now and I can say this is a solid 8/10 game. It is very easy to teach, the concept is not hard to understand even for my sister-in-law.  It provides enough interaction to sway the outcome to your victory. It is think-y, but not brain burning. Rating went up to 8.

Changed rating from 7 to 8.2 in 3/2014.

The rating is for Speicherstadt with the Kaispeicher expansion (which essentially completes the game).

May be a little long for what it is. Every placement is agonizing as you analyze the options, manage the tight economy and weigh the repercussions of your placement on your opponents play. The game finally clicked when I realized about half of the game is about denying your opponents what they need instead of just getting what you want. This can be a pleasantly nasty little game and is underrated.

RATING: 3
There's a ton I dislike in this game. Everyone seems enamored by the bidding mechanism where the first player in has the opportunity to buy it, but everyone who bids after him makes the price more expensive. I dislike this, because the income per turn is so low, that forcing someone to pay more than they should for a card they need can cripple you on future turns, but choosing to not pay can mean you just don't get any cards at all, which is equally crippling. Then the mechanism of how fire resolves, where it rewards the player who was able to get the firehat card and hurts the player struggling to get any cards at all. Then, I also dislike how in the first few rounds you need to buy contracts and merchants who require resources that come into play randomly in the future, which you also then need to be able to afford, and it's not uncommon to have cards in front of you that you had to really fight for that you never get to execute. The expansion also is bad in that it adds another card row at the top that allows players to make sure some cards never see play as an aggressive move, and gives nearly free cards to whoever happens to be last in turn order. I really don't see any appeal to this game at all.

I like the clever auction, but I felt like it was a great mechanic in search of a game. The rest of it was just so generic and bland, with the cards reminding me a bit of St Petersburg.

RATING: 7
This is a interesting auction game, of a very different variety.  It is half auction, and half pushing other players out of auctions.  It can get a little cut throat.  Resources are pretty limited and decisions can be tough, a Feld hallmark.  The mechanics don't feel as interwoven with each other like many other Feld designs though.Over all it is a fun game, that is pretty easy to grasp.  Although I would suggest making it only an every once in awhile game as it plays out very similar each play, and could get pretty samey.

This game is more or less carried by one single, albeit clever mechanic. And what is wrong with making that one special mechanic the axis and focal point of the game ? I actually like Speicherstadt's minimalist and purist approach and apart from the odd 'fire' concept that might have been a leftover from a previously more sophisticated design, the game relies solely one a few nitty-gritty rules and mechanics. The theme is almost non-existent but the bits are nice, the money and the artwork on the cards. A solid variation of the bidding/collection genre.

I got Kaispeicher with the base game and generally prefer it with the expansion. The extra cards and "reserve" mechanic make the game for me. And the coins are really nice.

http://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/66303/my-minor-expansions

However, I think with new players it might be best to try the base game on its own, and I've heard from people I respect that the expansion adds too much time and extra things that I shouldn't discount the base game on it's own.

That said, any plays recorded here that don't specify the expansion or not probably were played with the expansion.

Bello, intelligente, semplice e veloce. Speicherstadt ha una profondità incredibile. Lo sfondo è quello del commercio e i soldi in circolazione sono pochi. Molto interessante il sistema di gioco, una simpatica e "cattiva" (continue bastardate tra i partecipanti) asta all'olandese (si parte dalla cifra più alta e abbassando la puntata fin quando qualcuno accetta di pagarla). Il gioco è ben bilanciato e permette diverse strategie, con una interazione fortissima. Infine la variabile incendi, mettono la giusta tensione e dove subentra una piccola componente fortuna, che possono finire di premiare chi ha investito molto sui pompieri. Stefan Feld è sempre una garanzia!

A fun mix of worker placement and auctions. Plays fast, and easy to learn, but with a decent amount of depth.

But, here's what I really want to talk about: the name of the game. It was a really poor marketing decision on the part of Z-Man games to not come up with an English title. Unfortunately, most Americans are just going to remember that the game has "some German name" and will be unable to find it on BGG or online stores. Even those who like the game will have difficulty purchasing it since they won't be able to remember and spell the title.

Incredibly simple rules with a unique bidding mechanism where the earliest claim on a resource allows first preference to purchase it, but also requires the highest purchase price (vs. later claims on the same resource).

Played with Allen and Blake (taught it) at DollarCon in Oct. '12.  Really enjoyed it, but Blake said it's no good without the expansion so to buy/trade would be tough.

Dec. '12: Thanks to my sister Allison for giving me the game for Christmas.  And I was able to locate a copy of the expansion at GameSurplus in time for Christmas.  Pumped!!

Feb. '12: Strangely, I think I might enjoy it better WITHOUT the expansion because it's faster/cleaner and there aren't the screwage cards.  I do miss the secondary auction without the expansion though.

I first played this game with a library copy at the UK Games Expo in 2012. I found it to be a delightful light-medium game that I would be very happy to play again. I'm a certified Feld fan, and this is much lighter and more straightforward than any of his other games - and will probably appeal to a much wider variety of gamers. I don't think it is amazing, but it's a very good lighter game.

Now fast forward to December 2015, when my wife bought a 2nd-hand copy here on BGG. (Ironically when at the same time I had bought her a copy as a surprise Christmas present - which I therefore had to return.) I've only played once since then (for 2 plays in total), and my impressions from 2012 were confirmed - it's a good light game, fairly unique, although not one I'd particularly go out of my way to play.

This game features a good balance of tension and screw you type of gameplay. I think it achieves very well to minimize valuation of what is available by allowing a fair amount of 'blocking' moves.

Money is tight however, so valuations remain extremely important, but there are so many clever things you can do with that limited buying capital that it does not feel like a typical auction game.

Wonderful, rather misunderstood card game: simple, but subtle. If only the Kaispeicher expansion had been included as part of the original design! I never play without it. You are just obtaining cards which mean victory points or a contribution to them, but the heart of the game is how you go about trying to achieve this while thwarting others by means of two clever bidding mechanics. The joy of this game is reminiscent of that elicited by the 7 Wonders Duel tug-of-war, only with (often) more players, which can result in a kind of ritualised negotiation.  Plenty of opportunity for skillful play: offensive and defensive moves, jostling for small advantages, and a significant psychological dimension if you are playing with people who have already got past the learning game. Scales very well from 2-5, and feels different with each player count. A game that works well for inexperienced gamers too. (For me it would be even better if I had been able to obtain the expansion in English). Negatives: the first season is a bit samey and there is often nothing to choose between some of the cards early on. Maybe the impending re-theme (which sounds more interesting than trading in Hamburg - Vikings! And in Yorkshire! And in English!) will address this and other minor gripes such as the scoreboard only going up to 40 for some reason.

too much of the game is about working out exactly what other players will do on their turn, rather than any kind of heuristic pricing, strategy, or synergies. It's very brittle reasoning, so you have to spend time getting every detail right, which I found tedious and frustrating.  More like playing chess than a Euro, which is fine but not what I was looking for.

Bidding and pricing mechanism are neat but appear a bit random after some plays. In our rounds, a player often doesn't get to buy anything in one round and is therefore all mighty in the next round, allowing him to pick up almost every card he has bid for.

The rest of the story (get the goods, sell the goods or use them to fulfill contracts in order to get points) is not really refreshing and doesn't offer enough to keep me interested.

A nice simple bidding mechanism is behind this game. The actions the cards can perform make for some interesting choices, especially in games with more than two players.

All in all it's a nice little game, but can be frustrating to play with the wrong crowd.

The idea at the core is very clever. I like the dilemma: do I go here early, at the risk of paying the card too much (or not being able to pay for it at all) or do I get here late, at the risk of seing the card be bought by another player? The "dressing" of the game is much more conventional though.

RATING: 8.75
This game is a lot of fun with 3 or 4 people.  2 is predictable, and 5 doesnt give you enough bidding rounds per stack.  The placement of agents in the demand phase is absolutely brilliant, and makes for some awesome player interaction.  

After only half a dozen plays, however, I really see the need for the expansion (if I can find a copy!)  As it stands, I probably have another 6 plays or so before I get tired of it.  

9.0 w/kaispeicher expansion! 8.25 without.  Lets call it an arbitrary 8.75

RATING: 8
I generally prefer the heavier and more complex games, but this is one of my favorite medium to light games. The theme might be dry, but the game does a remarkable job in simulating the feeling of running a river-front warehouse for profit. Packs a lot of punch for a relatively light game! For a bidding game this works surprisingly well with just two players. Also, when played as a two player game, one gets rid of a minor weakness in the game, which is the potential for king making that can happen with higher player counts.

Cute worker-placement idea in terms of getting what you want vs. making an action more expensive for others, but the core idea is tired and overused.

Only 3 workers per round and nearly random scoring options give this game very little control.

The Speicherstadt is a good super-filler auction game that can be played under 45 minutes. The auction mechanism is simple to explain and really quite brilliant. There are no complex calculations to make as money is [i]really[/i] scarce, so bids generally max out at 3 coins. The system built around it is serviceable, but nothing really stands out. In fact, you'd probably forget that this is a Feld game if not for the inclusion of the disaster mechanism. 

The greatest caveat is that like most auctions, everyone must be in this to win and maximise their own scores. This mechanism is particularly vulnerable to kingmaking, and I've seen a game or three get derailed by a single player who was just baying for blood. Although written some time back, a lot of stuff mentioned in my [thread=791535]review[/thread] still holds up.

A könnyedebb Feld játékok közé tartozik a szép nevű Speicherstadt, aminek a fő mozgatórugója a lapok megszerzésének mechanizmusa. A játék tulajdonképpen 5 különféle kereskedelmi cikk megszerzésén és ezek felhasználásával szerződések teljesítésén nyugszik. Ez így túl sablonos lenne, ezért más módokon is lehet győzelmi pontokat szerezni a kártyát által, azaz az eddigi Feld játékok jó hagyományát követve nem egy út van a győzelemig. A lapok megszerzésének mechanizmusa nagyon érdekes, konfrontációs, de nem éreztem annyira vészesnek, főleg 4 játékos esetében. Nem kell attól félni, ha az ember nem szerez lapot minden körben, úgy is bőven van esély a nyerésre a jó kiegyenlítő pluszpénz miatt. Mindenképp a Macao, Notre Dame, In the Year of the Dragon után sorolom, de nagyon jó kis játék a Speicherstadt. Egyszerűsége, gyorsasága, könnyen taníthatósága miatt bármikor elővehető.

[2011-08-26]
Második parti öt játékossal és látható pénzzel játszódott. Ennyi játékossal úgy érzem egy-egy döntés nagyban befolyásolhatja a többi játékost, nagyobb az esély a királycsinálásra. A látható pénzt még nem tudom megítélni mennyire szerencsés. Így persze jobban számítható a játék, de lehet titkos pénzekkel érdekesebb.

[2011-08-27]
Egyértelműen azt mondom további két játék után, hogy sokkal jobb rejtett pénzzel játszani a játékot. Így is számolgatós természetesen, de jobb játékélményt ad, mert nem a kevés pénzű játékoson való könnyű lapszerzésé a főszerep. És teljesen jól működik öten is. Nagyon így sem nyúlik el véleményem szerint. Kíváncsi vagyok egy kétszemélyes partira is!

RATING: 4
As I've come to expect in a Stefan Feld game, there is a nifty and innovative gimmick driving an otherwise boring/shallow system.  The spine of this game revolves around a very cool auction system, but what you are actually auctioning ends up being dull when successful and frustrating when not.

The game randomly supplies cards and then players attempt to get cards.  If there are even cards available that you want/need the path that you are able to get cards is riddled with chaos and the caprice of other players.  When two players need something they waste each others energy, while other players can just stroll away with great deals.  

SF usually uses some kind of mini game race to keep players on their toes and aware of what other players are doing, see: Rat Track (Notre Dame), Initiative Track (Macao, In the Year of the Dragon). The Fireman is this game's version of it and frankly it is really disappointing. It feels so unfulfilling: get the most win some points, the least loses them, the rest get nothing.  The values are absurdly varied (there is a huge difference between 1 and 5 in this game) and again the caprice of others allows for people to stumble into cards or be lacking. 

Like many of Feld's games, I think it can be too obvious that you won't be winning the game about halfway through, and then you just go through the motions like a good sport to keep the game moving.  Really, not my favorite thing.  

I think that the worst part of this game is that you can go rounds without getting anything accomplished, and your result for all your efforts is an extra coin.  It feels meager.  I highly recommend that you don't go first if you can help it as your really are shoved face first against the whims of other players.

I enjoy games with many small victories, and there are a few to be had here (fulfilling shipments and matching the Counting House), but really there is too little happening that is exciting for me.  Worse, you can have turns where there is no worthwhile action for you other than just to make things more expensive for other players.  Yuck.

UPDATE: Continue to enjoy the unique reverse bidding mechanic and quick gameplay of this one.

Probably the most mediocre Feld, the chief specialist in mediocre design. I like the auctions. They're interesting. But the game itself is bland. In that respect, it feels a lot like Augsburg or Goa. And as far as euro auction games go, it's no Knizia.

It's a quick little game with a cool auction mechanism: each round, several cards (e.g., ships bringing cubes, contracts for specific cube combinations, firemen strength 1-5, special VP buildings, merchants that convert cubes to money, etc.) are up for auction. A bid is made by placing one of your 3 tokens in line on the item desired; when resolved, in order placed, pay $1 per meeple in line, or pass (and remove your meeple from the line), thereby making it cheaper for the next person. There are several things to balance: getting cubes to fulfill contracts, dealing with the 3 fires scattered (1 at end of round 2, 2 in round 4, 1 at end of game) -- player(s) with most firemen (highest sum) gets VP, player(s) with fewest lose VP -- and earning more money, since you only earn $1 each turn (unless you didn't win any auctions; then earn $2). Money is very tight!

Good, but not great. Like most auction games, you really have to play this with people who understand the value of the various items -- a newbie amongst experienced players will likely throw the game towards some lucky person. Still, I expect this would be a good filler for people familiar with it.

RATING: 7
An extremely simple yet extremely elegant game.  With only 30 minutes to play you might not find a better game to get the brain juices flowing.

Each round in this game consists of a series of cards coming out that players bid for in turn.  The complexity of the game exists in the card abilities and bidding system.

The game does have certain  crippling weaknesses though, especially in a two player game.  That being that money and the ability to make and accumulate it is the "end-all, be-all".  Sometimes nothing other than being lucky enough to be first bidder on certain cards when they come out will win you the game (specifically the bank and the one-for-one traders).  With these cards you can guarantee yourself pick of future cards and still have money to go again each subsequent round.  This is especially true, like I said, with only two players.

For what it is though, a quick filler, it is very thinky and pretty good.  And, as usual with Feld, the machanics are elegant and well-designed.

Simple game with very poor replayability. I like the worker placement decision and the way the game flows.

The game turns out to be static in a sense that when players start to know the game better they end up in a situation where best cards are always obvious and choices come more easy in that sense.

Overall I like the game and the way it plays: simple, quick and with minor challenge.

EDIT:
I'll keep the rating although the experience of playing this game with the expansion was so much worse!

So far I find the auction annoying and the rest is not grabbing me either. Something is missing here, or maybe it is simply not the right game for me. And I usually like games where you can plan and scheme your moves against the other players, there just is not that much planning and scheming in the end. Especially with 2 players it is dry, it works better with 3 or more (less predictable with more players). I love the theme though.
Played it with 4 players now which improves the game immensely, so I hoisted my rating up a bit, now the bidding has some depth to it. Still, a lighter game that doesn't thrill me.

Not a bad game. I did a multi-player game and a two-player online play. For an "auction" game, I think it works with two in a sense, though you are really just trading off advantage for a while. Shines better with more people. If I didn't have 30 other auction style games that I would rather play, I would probably keep this but just give me For Sale or Biblios and I am fine, yes they are simpler games, but is this game really all that complex?

The Speicherstadt might be the Stefan Feld game that, in my opinion, differs the most from his other designs. While he is known for making point salad euro game filled with a plethora of mechanisms that works together in different ways for players to score points, The Speicherstadt is a straight up auction game. Players are competing to get different buildings, trade goods, ships (for shipping goods) and fire fighters, in order to gain points in different set collection competitions. It's a fine game, yet I do not see that it has the potential to compete against the grater gamaes of the auctioning genre.

This is quite simple game with one interesting mechanic, yet it is not enough challenging nor engaging. No emotions or a very little at all. Some elements (cards with miscellaneous actions, contracts etc.) being collected are scarce and exist only in a few copies, distribution is very random what makes any thoughtful planning impossible; slight negative interaction. In sum: the world could exist without this game, although publisher's production line possibly not :)

The Speicherstadt has one of the nastiest bidding mechanisms I've ever seen and I think it's pure genius.  In typical Feld fashion, you never have enough of what you need and the bid mechanism preys on that vulnerability. 

The game plays quickly and yet offers an incredible amount of depth and decision making.  A perfect game for 4 players with about 75 minutes looking for a nasty pseudo-auction/worker placement game.

Sold in my game auction 12/2011.

RATING: 7
Simple auction game set in Hamburg's warehouse district at the turn of the 1900s. Players bid each turn for various action cards that bestow certain benefits upon their owner. Victory points are gained through supplying certain goods (purchased from ship cards during the auction) to contracts (also purchased through auction) and obviously the skill is in matching the goods with the contracts. This isn't an easy goal to achieve as other players can price you out at the auction thereby potentially providing a great deal of non-direct conflict. Money is extremely tight throughout the game, which makes every decision important, and a fine balance has to be met in acquiring funds and going for victory points. Like most of Stefan Feld's games this is very well designed, it just doesn't feel particularly original and doesn't really have anything to raise it above so many other auction games also available. It plays pretty quick though, has genuine replayability, and is a solid effort.

Clever little sort-of-bidding game.  Pretty fun and plays quickly.

In turn order you place one of your workers in the checkout line (like a grocery store line) for each of the cards that are available for sale.  Once everyone is done, the guy at the front of the line at checkout counter 1 can choose to buy the card or not.  The catch is that the price is equal to [b]the number of people in line[/b].  If he says no then he leaves the store and the next person in line can buy the card for one less.  repeat and proceed to counter two etc.  The cards you buy are generally a requirement for a certain set of colored cubes or a ship filled with cubes drawn from the bag.  There are some twists.  Some cards are firemen and at a four points in the game there are fires.  The player with the most firemen gets points; least firemen looses points.  Some cards let you sell cubes for money and some cards provide bonus points.  At the end of the game filled sets of colored cubes are worth points and most points wins. 2010/07/29

RATING: 6.5
It falls into the category of "clever filler" for me. A simple, clever central mechanic (in this case, the bidding) that everything else hangs off. After the 2nd play though, I felt that there was a significant tactic to always outbid the opponent who 1) Goes before you, and 2) Has less $ than you. I suppose that with more plays, other tactics will emerge, such as watching what your opponent(s) really need and pumping up the prices on those. Gregor did a great move to screw over Aaron by pumping up the price of a card that Aaron really needed so that Aaron couldn't afford it and was forced to Pass, and then Passing on the card himself to waste it! :-D

I'm also thinking that bidding on items towards the LH side of the board seemed to be a good idea - by the time the bidding gets to those, chances are high that ppl have less $$ because of prior purchases. So yes, a clever central mechanic that spawns off several interesting decisions to make and it doesn't hurt that it plays real quick.

Overall, The Speicherstadt is a solid auction game exploring a style of auction rarely seen in gaming. Everything up for sale is visible at the start of the round. Each turn, the players announce their interest by placing a meeple next to the card they'd like to purchase. This continues until everyone is out of meeples. However, order matters. Whoever places their meeple first in line for a card, gets first chance. Yet the more people who place their meeple next to an item, the higher the price. If the first person refuses, then the next in line has the same opportunity (albeit for a slightly lower price), and so on down the line until someone purchases the card.

The auction mechanic is an interesting exercise in gamesmanship because it's just as important to place your bid in the correct position as it is on the correct item. Simply jumping on a hot item first isn't the best strategy because you'll often end up either overpaying or not being able to afford the item at all -- and then watch as your opponent purchases the card for less money. How deliciously nasty! You can of course place multiple bids on the same card to afford yourself multiple opportunities to purchase the card (typically an early chance and a later, cheaper chance), but it will cost you an extra turn, and you may simply end up increasing the price for yourself.

Managing the timing of bidding is the core of the game, and it's a fascinating core. I only wish the rest of the game lived up to the basic auction mechanic. What left a slightly sour taste in my mouth was the point-system, which was opaque, especially on first play. All items up for auction come from a deck of shuffled cards. Until you develop experience with the game, you won't be able to tell what's coming. How many cards are in the deck, and how many of each type? When do the valuable contracts come out, and when do they stop coming out? How many contracts should I be aiming for? All of this will come with experience, of course, but compared to an auction game like Medici where the point-scoring system is out in the open from the get go, Speicherstadt felt like it was unnecessarily hiding information from me -- and that took away from the brilliant auction mechanic because I could not appropriately value things. Too bad.

Will I enjoy the game more as I play it more? Probably. And yet even then I'd prefer a game that didn't require me to memorize the deck of cards so as to know how and when to bid. Perhaps a cheat sheet is the answer, something to let me know which cards are in each phase of game. That might be enough to solve the problem. I certainly hope so, because that auction mechanic really is fascinating.

I'd certainly try this again with fewer players, but my first experience with five players was not a good one. I'm a big fan of bidding games, and the tight economy in The Speicherstadt feels right. However, at least with five players, you often have very little control. There also can be runaway leader problems, as the rich get richer and it's often left to the same people to fall on the grenade of making leaders pay a fair price, sacrificing one of their three bids to do so. And, of course, the game is entirely dependent on people playing rationally. In my first game, my bid on a "2 Fireman" attracted a conga line of outbids, while the leader's placement on a "3 Fireman" went uncontested, costing him only one coin. I guess stupid play can break nearly any game, but The Speicherstadt seems especially fragile and prone to this, as stupid play doesn't just hose that player, but also randomly shoots someone else in the foot. And with five players, at least, players' control over their own destinies is nearly nonexistent.

RATING: 7
The key to The Speicherstadt is a simple, zesty, and unique bidding mechanism.  It's admittedly susceptible to turn order.  But it's hard to find fault because the whole thing moves so quickly.  If tweaked, that bidding device could anchor a much heavier game.

Not a bad game, but I just don't like playing it very much. Money is incredibly tight and the game only really works with 3-4 players. It just doesn't work with two (this type of auction mechanic isn't meant for two players) and with five players you don't really have any control.

I would play again, but I would prefer to play many other light euro games over this one (Through the Desert, Pergamon, Order of the Gilded Compass, to name a few).

This game is about 15 minutes past a filler. It's pretty light, but still provides some good strategy decisions. I like the way it mixed auctioning and worker placement. My wife likes it and will play it pretty much any time I request it--she likes quick-playing, not-too-difficult, minimal-choices types of games.

One thing I really enjoy about it is its portability. Once you know the game, you don't really need the board and you can pack it all up in a ziploc baggie. I recently took it on a cruise and everyone was surprised how much punch it packed in such a small footprint.

A great game that I'm glad to have played it.

Damn, I liked!

RATING: 7
Physically beautiful. The components are great except for the warpy cards.

I really like the auction mechanic in this game. The amount of money in the economy is very low (no fine valuations possible), players can "bid" only three times (on up to six cards), and the price is basically equal to the number of bidders. A card is offered to players in order of their placement of bids on it, with the price decreasing as people decline to buy or are unable to buy.

Auctions in games can be difficult to play solo, as the range of possible player actions can be vast, but this mechanic does well in dividing up and sharpening the questions posed to a player.

What are you bidding on? Ships bearing randomly drawn goods (cubes in five colors: always good), contracts to satisfy with those goods, firemen (which function as an arms race reminiscent of military in 7 Wonders), and buildings that do such things as convert goods to money, or simply grant VP. It could certainly be worse (less interesting), as I feared it might be pure set collection or something.

I am a little alarmed at how unforgiving (and thus perhaps even [i]random[/i]) Speicherstadt seems to be. There are only 50 cards to buy (offered 5 at a time in a 4p game; other player counts have fewer total cards) and numerous cards exist only once in the whole deck. It's possible to find part-way through the game that one no longer has anything useful to do with the goods. Or you can find yourself holding partially satisfied contracts that you have little prayer of being able to finish. Miscalculating your bids in a single round, or coming into a round with insufficient money to do what it turns out you need (once you see what cards come up) can, it seems to me, lose you the game pretty abruptly.

...Another play. Not sure whether the bidding mechanism is highly tactical, or perhaps just out of player control. It certainly seems like you frequently would maximize your likelihood of winning a card by bidding on it as late as possible, possibly burning bids arbitrarily on items you don't really need, just because you have to do something.

It amazes me how different the player positions can look. Mostly in a good way, but I do still suspect one's position is excessively fragile.

Great game, doesn't take too long, lots of choices to be made.  I was playing with a good group so this could be AP prone but we didn't see that happen.  LOTS of player interaction.  If you don't like "screw your opponents" type games this one might not be for you.  Almost every piece you play makes things more expensive for your opponents, so most of the pieces you play will upset someone whether you meant to or not.

Streamlined euro that is built around a simple, but interesting bidding mechanism. It comes across as a medium filler game that is very easy to explain, yet difficult to win. Probably suitable as a gateway game for casual gamers. I must admit that I generally like Stefan Feld's clean and hassle-free designs (e.g. Notre Dame and In The Year Of The Dragon). This one is his lightest yet.
UPDATE: I find the game less interesting with 5 players. With 5, there really are not enough cubes to go by. 3 Players is not optimal either, because the effect of the fires gets too big. Cannot wait to play with 4 :-).
UPDATE: Turns into a better game (easily a 7) with the Kaispeicher expansion.

RATING: 7
It is easy to hate this game because the auction mechanic is brilliant and frustrating all at once. The rules for the auction is not tough to understand, but I am still unable to wrap my head around how to maximize my decisions during the auction phase. It speaks to the subtle interactions and emerging complexity that may not be evident in reading the rules. This is a good sign for the game.

    The money is tight beyond belief and every dollar counts. Without a constant flow of money, bidding during the auction phase is tough. That said, having money alone does not guarantee you will easily win auctions. In fact, the threat of having money and hence, being able to purchase something on a column is a potent force in and on itself. Being able to afford an item prevents others from competing with you and thus, making the item cheaper for purchase. This then allows you to accumulate wealth for future rounds. Points scored are generally low and cards are not filled with icons and text. This is not a typical Feld-inspired point salad scoring game. 

   This game is tough to rate. On the one hand, I marvel at the simplicity of the game design. On the other hand, the game is brutal, suffocating, frustrating especially if you cannot get your engine going to make money. The game is slightly reminiscent  of another Feld-design: In the Year of the Dragon where bad events constantly happen to hammer your scores. Overall, I have to admit this is a good game and deserves an above average rating. Just be in the right mood and frame of mind when playing it.

I'm very intrigued by the bidding mechanisms. So much so that I was really, really looking forward to getting it to the table. A few games later, my enthusiasm has faded somewhat, and while I still think it's a good game, I'm not in any rush bring it out again.

A superb couples game and that's from someone who really dislikes the bidding / auction mechanic. 
The expansion adds a few 'not so nice' cards but not too many. Overall I like the additional game elements it introduces.

RATING: 6
A minimalist auction/economic game where managing a *very* tight money supply is a bit more interesting and substantial than trying to manipulate the not very many moving parts to maximize scoring.  I think I'd like this game more if it was longer, and there was more variety in what comes up.  As it was, enjoyable but I don't really feel the need to return to it.

Personal favorite Feld game. Warning- do not play with people who are quick to anger! Highly confrontational worker placement/bidding hybrid that lasts just long enough.

RATING: 7.5
nice, fast paced game with interesting decisions.  my one criticism is that the start player can be placed at such a large disadvantage (essentially the loss of 1/3 of his bid ability during that turn), that if you're the start player at the wrong time, or more often than the other players, you may be severely handicapped.  DESPITE that,  I would certainly play it again.

the rule the group I played with thought sounded good after the game-  figure out which players are going to be the start player more often during the game, and give them 1 more silver each at the start of the game.

I am pretty tired of all these bidding games with new twist. It is still bidding game with this new twist.

RATING: 8
Thematically, I was drawn to the idea of collecting goods from ships, then converting them into points by fulfilling contracts. In practice, this feels a pretty small portion of the game to me. One reason is that there seems to be so few Contracts when they must also be shared with others. For another, I get a sensation that the count of City cards is overwhelming.

I feel I can only focus on one type or the other. Once I have a Contract, for example, I feel I cannot allow myself the distraction of disrupting someone who is reaching for the full set of Counting Houses. 

These issues might give me reason to dislike the game, but all that is so overpowered by the excited emotion generated in the bidding conflict.

I have trouble calling this an auction game. **It's not just bidding, it is bullying.** I don't beat my opponent by bidding higher, rather I undermine his bid so he can't pay/won't want to pay. I out maneuver him so that I pay less.

Bidding game, where you bid on contracts, and ships of random goods, in an attempt to fulfill those contracts and earn points. Other cards allow you to turn goods into cash if they don't fit your contracts, or provide other ways to earn points.

Very interesting bidding system where the price of a card is based on the number of meeples placed in the queue to purchase it. So, if there are 4 meeples waiting, the price is 4 bucks to the first meeple in line. If the player that owns that meeple can't afford it, or doesn't want to pay that much, they can remove their guy and walk away. This means there's now 3 remaining, so the 2nd meeple in line now has the opportunity to buy the card for 3 bucks. If he walks away, price is 2 bucks to third in line, and so on.

This can lead to some sneaky play, for example if player A currently has a meeple on a card, player B can come along and place a meeple behind him to raise the price. In fact, he could do this three times, raising the price to 4 bucks. If A should walk away, then B can walk away twice, and buy the card with his third meeple for 1 buck.

Money is extremely tight, as income per round per player is just 1 buck. Since you rarely win anything for that low, most players only ever seem to have 1 or 2 bucks on hand. If you don't win any cards in a round, you are compensated by getting income of 2 bucks instead of 1. Woohoo.

This is another excellent Stefan Feld design. It's lighter than Macao and Luna, but I like it a lot.

An innovative Dutch auction mechanism drives this otherwise run-of-the-mill mid-weight Euro. I really like it- the auction offers a unique challenge and the other elements complement it well. Almost everyone I've introduced this to has really liked it, and it is delightfully simple to explain. A strong mid-weight game.

Hamburg around 1900 - the gate to the world. Within the harbour there stretches a unique complex of storehouses: Speicherstadt. The network of canals and bridges houses a terminal for spices, coffee, tea and carpets from all over the world.
\13\\13\
As one of Hamburg´s wholesaler at the heyday of the Speicherstadt you acquire shiploads for the storehouses, not too expensive, of course, as you like to make a profit selling them. Who makes the best deals within a year and supplies his clients with the right goods will be the winner of the game. But beware! Sudden fires cause heavy losses. You might be advised to invest in fire protection early.

This game is very good without the expansion. I had originally rated this game as a 7.5 - I'd play it most of the time if suggested and considered it a great game for new players.

With Kaispeicher, however, this game is phenomenal. It plays quickly and has a tremendous amount of decision making and tension. I can't wait to play this one again soon.

This was purchased solely on the basis of fond memories at the real Speicherstadt in Hamburg.

It is a nice, clean game of bidding, goods collection and sales, and contract fulfillment where every play is full of painful decisions and a (short) nail-biting wait to see how badly you hopefully didn't screw yourself

RATING: 8.5
Very tight auction game. Simple rules and quick to play, but also very cut throat. I like the small set of cards it uses and the amount of interactions they allow as well as the setup of the decks and the fire mechanic.

2-player does play well but I feel like there are a couple of issues with it: fires are too swingy and the bank is too powerful. Fires are like poverty in a 2-player game of London, you are forced to prioritize them over anything else since it's a head-to-head competition, meaning the worse you do the better your opponent scores. The bank just seems to always be on the winning side. I think both of these will be remedied with the Kaispeicher expansion.

Kaispeicher opens this game up a lot and is potentially necessary. This game plays very well at all player counts but may be a little snowbally at 2.

I know it's a light game, but this one just feels way too simple.  I don't consider the bidding mechanic to be very interesting like some do...and that was supposed to be a big selling point on this one.  The reason it's as high as it is is because the quality of components are good and my wife enjoys it because it's simple.

Another Stefan Feld game that left me lukewarm.  Several of us felt the 5-player game was more frustrating than fun.  Too few turns, too little money, too few cargo, too few contracts - simply too many restrictions and too little time to accomplish much.  When you end up with only 1 contract (even if worth 11 pts) in the entire game.  Might play better with fewer players where each season last more than 2 turns.

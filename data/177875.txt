GAME: The Last Spike
RANK: 3022
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
1 play / 5 players

LIKE: Quick, with many interesting decisions.
DISLIKE: The poorly made board is an absolute let down. Some players get screwed by being forced to play their last tile, even if it is not the "last spike". Some randomness in the tile draw.

OVERALL: Despite the low production value, and my initial doubts, the game is surprisingly good. Everyone at the table liked it. ( I may rate it a "7" after a few more plays if the game works with the lighter crowd. )

Interesting push your luck track laying and investment game. The game is spartan and simplified to the essence, but remains interesting.

Wonder about replayability, would need more plays to comment.

A game that was inferior to Acquire when first published forty years ago. And it still is. Varying cost of the tiles according to the terrain they cover rather than charging more for those adjacent to a city that have the potential to earn a free stock certificate, seems daft in game terms. The $20,000 bonus for placing the last tile may well decide your game.

Board, blocks and cards are standard Columbia, which is to say functional and solid though lacking aesthetic charm.

Quick, easy-to-learn railroad game. I played a couple games of The Last Spike and enjoyed myself reasonably well, but I think this game is a little too pared-down-to-the-basics to become a classic for me. Feels like Ticket to Ride's little cousin.

RATING: 5
3/21/16:  Rating may go up to a 6 with further play.  A good family game.  Very similar to Acquire, however you only hold 4 tiles at a time while with Acquire you can hold 6 tiles at a time.  I feel that you have more control with Acquire, where with Last Spike there are a lot more routes open.  Each route will close off once it has four tiles, so there are a lot more routes open at one time, and routes close a lot more quickly than mergers in Acquire.

Good for family or non-gamers because you can explain the rules in 5 minutes.

Probably best with 3 or 4.  Gets too chaotic with 5 or more.

Maybe my rating would be higher if I wasn't talked into playing this game by someone claiming they liked their games with "strategy". This game is 100% determined by the luck of your tile draws. If you draw a tile next to a city first, you not only get the first land card but you also don't have to pay for it AND you pay the actual cost of the tile. If you get a tile that is not next to a city or a tile connecting to track that is connecting to a city, you pay DOUBLE the tile cost and then you have the option of paying for some land that someone has already gotten for free. If you happen to have 4 or 5 bad tile placements such as this (which happened to me in the beginning of the game) you will see your funds deplete much faster than anyone else and you will always be playing catch-up. What a load of garbage. I would flip this game on it's head if I were to play again. Keep all the tiles face up and allow everyone to draft their first 4 tiles and to pick whatever tiles they want after that. Maybe even invert the $ amounts on the land cards so that the first person to invest has to pay the highest amount and it gets cheaper as it goes down. Whatever, maybe I'm just being a sourpuss. I liked the simplicity of the game and thought it was neat but it was barely strategic as all your moves are pretty obvious and there's not much you can do to circumvent bad tile draws.

Players are property speculators, trying to cash in on the transcontinental railroad, being built across the United States.  Simple, fast playing game that almost feels like an Acquire variant.  Players place a track tile, which may complete a four tile link between two cities, triggering property payouts for those now connected cities.  The game ends when the east-west connection across the board is completed, and richest player wins.  Really liked the clean feel of this one.  There is some luck involved, but the game is so fast, it can be forgiven.

Backed on Kickstarter since my wife was interested in a train game after seeing Ticket to Ride. Very unhappy with the quality and what came in the box for $50 (you can hear plenty about that in many reviews and comments). After multiple plays, this one isn't a keeper. Not enough true decision making, as most turns have a clear best play to make and the game often seems to be playing itself.

I think there is a good game in here. But it's NOT good with two, and it's NOT good with six. Another excellent case of the need for Truth in Publisher Player Counts.

Additionally, while there is a good game in here, it's a game that feels so much like Acquire that I'm not convinced I need to own both, and I've yet to find a game that tops Acquire in the light economic game space.

Acquire-ish, but not as good. I'm always interested in trying a minimalist game, but in this case there's just not enough to keep things interesting. Maybe if the board were bigger, with longer track sections...

Always loved train games, and this one is a nice addition to my collection. Really like how the tiles are placed, even if it's tricky to figure out the numbers at first (would have been nice if everything was bigger). Also like how the money is handled with purchasing stock in towns. It's quick to play, and a good combo of luck and strategy.

Looks like Acquire.  Quacks like Acquire.

Sadly this duck isn't Acquire.  It magnifies the worst of Acquire...the going broke, the dreadful tile draw hosing etc etc.

Only good if you play it several times in a row so everyone feels like they got a "good game" out of it.  But that type of gaming ended in the 1990s...a game has to be able to stand on its own in one playing.

This one doesn't.  It's not terrible though.  A few house rules would fix it:

1 - draw 2, discard 1 tile.  My typical Acquire house rule solves a ton of both games issues
2 - get rid of the last spike $20k.  It essentially determines the winner.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Well... it's a lot like Acquire, which means it's still got the tile-draw randomness and the potential to be badly hosed if you're not in on the first couple of payouts. In addition there's the randomness of certain tiles being objectively better than others (cheap vs expensive, next to a city vs middle-of-track). Meh. I'd play if it's the game going but I can't think of a situation where I'd request it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Very simple game, but there's actually a decent amount going on. When I learned the rules I was worried that the random tiles you had would make the game too lucky, but having 4 to choose from feels like the right amount. And there are a lot of good decisions to be made. It's generally not obvious which stocks to buy, and there is a good amount of opportunity to build in ways that slow down your opponents. Overall I was pleasantly surprised.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.8
This is a surprising simple game for a Columbia game but also pleasantly enjoyable.  While there is a fair amount of luck with the tile draws it can be managed most of the time.  That is the downside though, I've seen games where bad tiles cause a player to crash and burn, usually due to being forced to pay for double rails too often but that could also be due to overinvesting or buying to many expensive investments.  Still, it's fast and pretty enjoyable and I'd be happy to play it again.  That being said, I've played with 2, 3, and 4 players but I can't imagine playing with 5 or 6 (!!) because it be too chaotic.

I would love to say that this second edition is better than the original, but, because I enjoy quite a bit of luch in my games, I think that the removal of the dice track is actually a step back.  As in the original, the $20,000 bonus for completing the last spike is way over valued... play without it.

There is enough here to make the game worthwhile.  I like the cleaner game design... and it does play much quicker.   I'm glad I added it to my collection, but I'm afraid that the original will still probably get played more.  Maybe a few house rules are needed to add a bit more luck.

A tightly-wrought land speculation game based on tile laying representing the railroad coming to town.  Plays fast with many twists and turns as the tiles are played.  Not much time to react when playing with 5 or more players.  Luck is a factor, as in poker, or real-life land speculation.  Several back-to-back plays are possible within an hour, which is how I suggest the game is approached.  Winner is the highest cumulative total.  Each of our games has been lively.

The Last Spike is a re-print and slight re-mod of the original game from decades earlier.

I was finally able to let go of Acquire after getting this game. I don't think it completely fires it, but it feels so similar and plays in a much cleaner way. The components could have been a lot better though. Wooden chips as money is very odd, and I would have almost preferred paper money.

UPDATE: Feels very dry and mechanical to me at this point. I almost wonder if returning to Acquire would yield the same feel, as I don't like not being able to know when your shares will pay off. This game is fine, but I almost wish that there was more to it to set itself apart more from Acquire.

Surprisingly engaging for such a simple set of rules (4 A3 pages includes all rules, examples and hints on play). Played 4 games at the first sitting (when we had intended to play a selection of games once each). 
Only 1 thing stops the 10 rating, the "chips" for money are not numbered (but we had no real problems with this).
Incidentally, one of the land ownership cards was missing from my copy (we were able to make a paper replacement for our games) but I contacted Columbia Games (In Seattle, USA) and they sent the genuine article to me (in UK) within the week. Excellent customer service.

Has some Acquire feel, with its own differences to be its own game. 
As speculator you are trying to get the transcontinental railroad to towns you have interest. 
On your turn you pay to place one of your tiles, each link has 4 track elements of varying cost. When a link between towns is complete it triggers a property payout for the connected towns to the link. Players purchase interest in a towns which progressively cost more to acquire. The games ends when there is an east-west connection on the board.
I liked the feel of this one a mix of familiar put together in a simple fast playing way.

1 play, prototype (Origins 2015)

The game was OK -- sort of Acquire like, with a train theme. Unfortunately, I'm not a big fan of Acquire. Here, the board shows a number of cities in the U.S., connected to each other by 4-space routes. Central cities, of course, have more connections. Each space has a corresponding tile. Players start with some money (varies by player count) and 4 random tiles (kept hidden). There are piles of stock certificates, one per city, with differing prices per stock. On your turn, place a tile in a space; must pay the cost (more expensive over difficult terrain and if not connected to city or another tile). If you cannot pay, must auction off a deed to the other players (rules not totally clear in details). If you're the first to build next to a city, take the initial stock for free. If you complete a link, cities on either end of the route pay dividends: everyone holding those stocks gets dividends (more stock = more money). Then, you MAY buy a stock for any city that has been opened.

The game ends at the end of a player's turn when they place a tile connecting east and west by continuous track (the last spike). They get a $20K bonus for doing so. The player with the most cash wins! It felt very much like Acquire, although maybe faster game play?

Really interesting and funny simple train game. The randomness given by the pieces may result in a too much lucky driven game, some may argue, but I find it reasonably clean on its outcome.

Very good and reminiscent of Acquire. Even though there is no 'competing for majorities' in The Last Spike (probably the whole point of Acquire).

It plays well with two players (something Acquire doesn't do) and it doesn't require old school payout tables (like Acquire). I still love Sid Sackson's masterpiece but this more than deserves a place in my collection. 

Yes there is luck. Yes, you can get hosed by it. If that's the sort of thing that bugs you, you might be well served to take a pass on this.

tl;dr: [thing=5][/thing] with trains (and no mergers)

Yes, just like in Acquire you a number of blocks which indicate where you have to play them. And just like in Acquire you start a new company (and get a share of it) in certain situations. No, there's no denying that this game takes it's core from Acquire. Which is fine, because that game is awesome, so it gives the game a head start. But because you have more short term goals (with the completion of routes) and no mergers, it isn't as deep as Acquire.
So all in all a nice take on the Acquire mechanism with some nice twists, but don't expect this to replace the original.

RATING: 5
Theme stripped off, you have 48 tiles, 4 in each of 12 routes, in kind of a 4 pane window pattern. A&B lead to C&D and E&F, lead to U&V and W&X, lead to Y&Z. When you connect AB to YZ the game ends and the person finishing gets a large bonus. The game can come down to whether someone gets one of the 4 As and one of the 4 Bs, or a Y and a Z; if so, it's not too hard to hold up the game until you can claim the bonus. Add stocks for the intersection points--not the railroads--and that's it.

There is so much to like about this game. 

It is super quick to learn...and play! But yet, has tons of decision making processes that other games wish they could achieve in such a small time frame. 

A group of five could play a practice game of this in under an hour and have a great understanding of concepts and strategies by the time it is done and still have enough time to blast through two or three more games by the end of the night.

There is a random factor, so you better strap on your diplomacy hat and start talking up deals when you need to! You never know when the tiles will draw bad...and they will. 

If you are the type of player who is good at "locking the game" by knowing a board's strong and weak spots, you will do well against one player.

However, with three or more crafty players, you can forget the lockup strategy once they have a go or two at the game. Although there are still unknowns in a two player game (who has which tiles), in a three or more player game, it is hard to rely on anything other than the tiles you pick and the alliances you make (or break).

I love how Columbia still manages to get it's "fog of war" aspect into even this little simple game. 

So if you think bartering with friends and family in Settlers of Catan is challenging, wait until they get a load of this!

After playing three 3-player games and one 6-player game I'm giving this game an 8. The game scales well and becomes more tight with more players. Played with two non-gamers who kept asking to play it more. Despite others complaints about components, they work just fine. I was impressed with the cards because they are a higher quality than what Columbia has used in the past and there is actually an insert in the box. Columbia Games has a great game on their hands outside of their normal block wargames.

I met the designer/publisher on the subway to Essen who was a really nice guy and after having checked out the game I got very tempted to buy it. Unfortunately, this was the last day at Essen, so I was completely out of bag space and couldn't bring any more games back home.

Some months later I was able to grab a copy in back home in Sweden, and I'm really happy about it.

The rules are extremely simple and playtime is short. There are still lots of difficult choices and great indirect player interaction of the sort I very much enjoy.

Just purchased for the Christmas season.  Several of my adult children were home and over 2 days we played "The Last Spike" about 8 times!  We found the time (about 45 minutes) to be perfect, they loved the concentration in reviewing where to place a track and what land to buy!  So, a big "thumbs up"!   If you like a game that younger children AND adults can both enjoy this this is one to strongly consider!

The element of luck is big for this game, but railroad construction and an asset management of a stock are the game which can be enjoyed easily.
I like this.

1/1/2016: I feel like this game could be a lot better than it is. I'd like a larger set of tiles to have in front of you to decrease the effect of luck on having to pay double or not. I'm also curious about some sort of drafting mechanism. Or distributing most/all tiles and passing only a set number once. I also don't understand why larger sets don't collect a larger relative payout. Overall, there is too much luck for this type of game for me.

Compared with Acquire when described to me initially.   I guess that fits.

Linear Acquire.  Fast simple fun with rules you can teach in just a few minutes.  A perfect filler game as well.

Transcontinental railroad network builder from St. Louis to Sante Fe and via routes. Land speculation with Acquire like tile drawing to complete lines with a luck factor.

Would easily have given this a 10 if the board had been decently made. The artwork on the board is fairly unappealing as well. Also, I wish the game used money with values on it instead of colored chips, but that's not a huge deal. The game itself is great.

I was convinced to play with the following argument: Last Spike is a 30-40 minute Acquire with tracks and trains.  Alliteration gets me every time.

That's not a bad description, though Spike is significantly more claustrophobic than Acquire. It has a smaller board, and there are fewer tiles in players' hands.  This means fewer opportunities for strategic play, as you're more at the mercy of random tile draws and other players' actions.

Other cons: Giving away free stock for starting Sacramento or St. Louis seems unbalanced given the large payouts for those railroads.  The build costs for certain board spaces are also suspect, but it's possible that the pricing reasons are sound.

Given the short length, I can't complain too much. But I'd never own the game - certainly not for $40 - and I don't need to play again.

Played one game with 6. Playing tiles and buying stock similar to Acquire. The game was tight between 4 of the other players. Worth checking out.

I have the Last Friday, willing to accept in trade for the Last Spike. Or for Star Wars Imperial Assault if you can add a second game that I may be interested in.

Great light game and superb gateway game. Lots of tension, and not without meaningful decisions.

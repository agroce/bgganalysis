It's okay, but there are better ways to spend your gaming time

RATING: 7
Armorica is mechanically extremely simple; just pick up two cards per turn and add them to your row of cards.  However, the scoring system presents decisions about which cards to take - a certain symbol or a particular colour? Add to that a constant struggle to keep your side fed.  Overall, I quite like Amorica.

The artwork is not all that great, although everything is really quite functional and the quality of the cards is reasonable.

Production quality is not the best (distractingly large color differences between cards which are supposed to have the same color), but the concept is interesting. Might not last long at this rating, but could also be that playing it frequently will show the game to be even tighter than I already think.
More vicious with 3 (and presumably 4) than with 2.

RATING: 7
Engaging card game, where you have to have acquired resources to be able to take later cards - 7 Wonders style.  Scoring is for sequences of different colored cards, with the clever option to be able to discard scoring cards to improve the sequence of the remaining cards.  I enjoyed, my opponents not all as keen.

Likes:
    - Rules were simple and easy to read. (only one rule wasn't clear, with the starting player marker moving after every turn)
    - For what this game is, the gameplay time is perfect
    - There are some cool decisions to make throughout the game, maybe more so than most filler type games.

Dislikes:
    - The game basically has not theme, so expect this to be a very abstract filler game.
    - The artwork and graphic design are very poor.
    - Card quality leaves a lot to be desired.
    - Seems like this could get pretty boring after repeated plays.

Notes:
    - Kind of seems to match what for sale offers in terms of gameplay, but since For Sale has a better theme, better components, and is an overall better game, probably better to just stick with that game for this specific niche.

In this card game, you try to collect sets of different colors and symbols, which in turn let you pick more cards. I think we played one rule incorrectly: first player changes every round. We found gameplay to be heavier than your ordinary filler, since some cards cannot be removed once played. OK game, but nothing special.

This is a nice little filler but playing the game isn't very exciting. Very useful travel game due to it being only a deck of cards. Worth a try to see what you think. 1 Play.

RATING: 5
The best thing to get points in the game is to just amass people.  It seems cleaning up for runs does not add that many points to a row.  

It does play fast but not overly interesting.  I was taught it as an abstract game, and when I read the rules to see what the phases were called, I had to laugh.  This is the stupidest pasted on theme for this game.  It's best to think of it as an abstract.

Armorica is in that sweet spot for filler games. There's that 'just right' level of strategy, turn choices, game flow, and game length. The bonus scoring leaves enough room for re playability. Overall it struck me as a slightly more complex Coloretto-style drafting game. First play was with two players. I'm not interested in playing it with two again, but I definitely want to try this title again. 

Update: Traded. I liked it but I have too many fillers.

It's a solid little game, just nothing really jumped out at me enough that I really want to play it again.

As much as I loved Eric's first two games, the look and description on this one never caught my interest.  That was a real shame, because this is an excellent game!

An interesting filler that offers some good choices in a short amount of time. I don't know if the basic mechanism is enough to support a full game, but it might be well incorporated as part of a larger game.

Players collect cards from a display. The symbols on their own cards determine which ones are available to them, how many they can keep, and how many points they are worth at the end. It can be interesting determining which card is really best for you in the long run, but unfortunately you are more often likely to have very little choice.

RATING: 6.75
This 3rd vaguely Roman themed game from Eric B Vogel is more than just a filler, but not long enough to be a strategic game. It's a very interesting set collection game, with a lot to consider, yet with fairly simple mechanics and to a certain extent somewhat luck dependant as to the order of cards available for acquisition.

Players start with a Celt card, and add both Celt and Roman cards each round if possible, collecting sets of mixed colors, with various resource/storage tokens which permit increased cards in hand, and recruitment of different cards.

If Players don't have enough of the right resource, they cannot recruit some colors of Romans, if they don't have enough amphorae they cannot sustain all their cards and need to discard until they can. But discarding can be very useful in arranging those color sets for maximum points, so careful planning of resources is needed for maximum points.

This takes a little while to play through, and I can see a little occasional AP from some, but it's a really nice game and I'd guess it has a decent amount of depth for what it is.

Starting this at a 6.75 after a 1st 3-player solo game.

RATING: 6.5
Hm. This is a clever little game, that is quite easy to understand, yet quite thinky. But considering its mechanisms, the color choice is abysmal; it took me quite a while to understand that some cards were supposed to be in the same color. And after a while, it felt like lots of math. So admirable rather than fun for us.

I don't have much experience of "Euro card games", but I have to say that I like Armorica very much.  Essentially, your card choices force you to balance between increasing your resources of several kinds and gaining victory points.  The theme and artwork make for a pleasant distraction and I think that the card quality is excellent - they are very well laminated.  (Great for protecting against sticky pub tables!)

Note: I have recently played Through the Ages and have to say that Armorica captures a surprising amount of the feel of that game!  Obviously there is no development of technology here, but the management of resources and card drafting is surprisingly similar, to the extent that I would recommend it to fans of TtA!

RATING: 5
A strange card drafting game where the main trick seems to be stopping the cards you draft from starving to death, and in the cards you take strongly affect what you'll be able to get in the future.  As it's very different from most games I've played, it's probably worth checking out for card game fans. I did find myself a little frustrated as I got stuck in the negative feedback loop (can't draft many cards, can't stop cards from starving, nothing is getting better) instead of the positive one.

Still just a single play, so not a fleshed out comment.

Setup takes a bit.  But the play is smooth.

I like struggling to get the rainbow!  It's sort of a really quick little development game, where sometimes it is okay to starve your little fuckers.

The decisions are interesting, and the downtime is minimal.  That makes it fun for me!

A fine little filler. Nothing special: it has no real novelty or a scoring unseen before; it also has a rather big dose of luck involved (which is fine for a game of this length). It really works fine, just doesn't provide anything new.

LIKES:

* Set collection with a twist.  Limited to collecting cards based on the symbol/icon.  
* Potential for losing cards allows you to also manipulate cards in a row to some degree to potentially increase your color sets.

DISLIKES:

* Set collection isn't that thrilling to me.
* Rule set incorrect but thankfully the designer let me know before I played the first time...NOTE that the first player marker rotates each turn.

NOTE: only played two player.

Played 5-10 times. A good 30-min filler with pure card drafting from two rows on the table. Very simple rules with interesting decisions. Keeping an eye on the other players is important, but it doesn´t slow down play too much. Could have used prettier graphics. Playing time approx. 30 mins 4-player, which is appropriate. A keeper, though not a game I want to play every month.

03/15/11 Played a three-player game. I found Armorica to be a nice set collecting filler well worth playing. The cards are of very good quality, though some of the artwork is not quite first class. Yet its all quite serviceable. The (revised) rules are quite clear. 
04/26/11 Played another three-player game. More enjoyable now that we knew what we were doing from the get go. Plus it took less time. 
03/27/12 Another three-player game.

RATING: 7.5
Initial rating: Very good card game, slightly low on theme (as most card games) & gamey mechanics but with lots of decisions to make.

When you choose cards to add to your collection you have to watch:
- how many cards will stay (amount of aphora)
- the amount of different colours in a row (more=better)
- gold tokens on cards (1 gold = 1 point)
- sheep, olives and grape symbols (majority = 4 points)

So it's quite thinky for such a small short game. I like it. Tentavive rating after 2 plays with 2 & 3 players. Might go up after more plays.

There's a lot to think about in this little card game.  The main way of scoring is by making a row of different colored cards; each turn you draft two cards--one from a stack that contains 3 colors, and one from a stack that contains all 6.  The cards also have other symbols: amphora (which saves you from having to discard your cards), grain (which gives you more card choices when drafting a "base" color), and specialty goods (which allow you to draft the rarer colors).  The strategy comes in trying to figure out what will be available each turn (and thus, trying to figure out what your opponents will do), managing which cards you can take, and even trying to intentionally short your amphora so you can discard a wrong-colored card.  A lot to think about in a little game.

Quite interesting little abstract that was more fun than expected. The civilization theme works but very quickly fades into the background. Left me with that "once more"-feeling. Not sure of the staying power - maybe once you "get it", it grows old quickly.

RATING: 7
This is a neat card game. The concept is quite interesting, and the conundrum of deciding what you need to pick. A long run? Some more food for later? Do I want to mess up my opponent? Starve some to get rid of that card and create a long run?
Two problems I see: Games of four people would make it real hard to plan ahead, making the game a bit chaotic. 
Second, you must be good at keeping track of what you have in amphorae and cards, or count every turn. Nothing too terrible, but something to consider.

So, all in all, a decent filler, I would say a really good one for two players.

The early game is a bit too dominated by luckily having access to double-amphora cards.  The late game is a bit too much about messy math optimization.  The middle game is interesting, as you have options without perfect information, so I wish the rest of the game were more like that portion.

The game functions smoothly, but I don't see much reason to play it.

RATING: 8
A solid game of set collection combined with a unique kind of area control.  Contrary to somethings written, the game if played competitively, is neither light nor particularly quick.  The game requires a careful watch of your sets as well as the sets being worked on by your opponents, while balancing the acquisition of amphora and sheep/grapes/olives to control the extent you can acquire the cards you need before your opponents.  The game also requires a fair bit of downstream thought--both in card taking as well as judicious discarding, which can actually improve your sets if timed right.  There is enough going on here, if not to cause analysis paralysis, at least to cause analysis slowdown.  All that said, if played with the right group, the game is exceptional, and since the game is expensive, it is definitely worth picking up to try out. 

It's quick, small, good for a filler/end of night game.  It's in our closer rotation with Sushi zoch and Scripts and Scribes

Surprisingly deep.  Luck is something of an issue; you may be forced to starve because you couldn't get enough amphorae because your lack of wheat limited your choices.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Budget card game that provides a bit more depth than you'd initially expect. The idea is to build a set of cards by using matching icons on previously obtained cards to acquire new ones. Scoring is primarily achieved by building up a set of different coloured cards (there are six different colours), which is where the majority of the game's strategy lies as it's difficult to keep getting a different colour. The theme of Romans and Gauls feels a little detached from the game itself but there's enough going on here to merit repeated plays, and for the very low cost of the game it certainly provides good value.

Armorica is a very quick, simple card-drafting and set-collection game. The design is sharp and playing well is challenging - it'll take most players a full run-through before strategy starts to click for them. Fifteen years ago I'd have called this elegant and brilliant. Here in 2014, I expect a bit more, even from a card game. And for whatever reason - some solid ratings/comments or perhaps the seemingly rich theme - I thought there'd be more here. If you're looking for a speedy, no-frills, set-collection game, Armorica is just the thing. If you're looking for innovative design, real depth or something that shines as a cut above in its genre, look elsewhere.

This is a card game with simple rules, but there is a lot of strategy and it takes a couple of games to figure it out. If you like meaty card games, this game is for you. I wish the colors of the cards were a little bit more distinguished, but that is a minor issue. A hidden gem!

About [thing=67285][/thing]:

[b]1) What is it?[/b]
[thing=67285][/thing] is a quick card game in which take cards (Romans and Gauls) in order to form, in a row, sets of different coloured cards. At the same time, is necessary to keep everyone fed (to survive the winter starvation) and gather other symbols to help either by allowing to take some Roman cards, or to give extra points at the end of the game, or give more options during play.

Overall, [thing=67285][/thing] is simple to teach and even more easy to play, but offers a nice amount of decisions and possibilities with just a small deck of cards, colors and symbols. Yet, it fails to truly engage players and to create tension. Still, is good enough for occasional play.

[b]2) How do you play?[/b]
Each player starts with a Gaul card with two wheat symbols. The Gaul deck is set by letter, starting with the Gauls A, then B, and so on. The Roman deck is set by number, starting with Romans I, then II, and so on. The Gauls form a row of 6 cards, and the Romans another. A round has three phases:

a) Take a Gaul card or pass;
b) Take a Roman card or pass;
c) Winter starvation.

A player can take one Gaul card, picking from the rightmost card up to the card equal to the number of wheat symbols she has. Therefore, at the beginning, a player can pick one Gaul from the first two in the row (as everyone starts with 2 wheat). The same is valid for the Romans, as options to pick from, but some Romans demand also that the player have a symbol (grape, olive or sheep) in order to be taken - if the player doesn't have the required symbol, she can't take that Roman card. Gauls and Romans are added to the player row of cards, at the end of it, and can't be moved afterwards. If a player passes (by not taking either a Gaul or Roman), the rightmost card of the proper row is discarded.

Once every player has taken (or passed) a Gaul and a Roman, all players count the number of amphorae symbols they have. If the number of amphorae is the same or more than the number of cards the player has, nothing happens. If the number is less, then the player must discard cards until she has the same number of cards as she can feed. Cards can be discarded from any point in the player's row (which can help in getting a set of different colored cards bigger), just adjusting the row to fill the gap.

The game ends when either the Roman or the Gaul deck is empty. The current round ends, then it happens the final scoring. Players will score their sets of different colors in their rows. Also, will gain 1 point for each coin symbol. Finally, player with the most grapes symbols will gain 4 points, and the same for the sheep and olive symbols.

The player with the most points will be the winner!

[b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b]
Which card to take, considering color and symbols it has. That is the main, and possibly, only decision a player will make. There is no way to manipulate the rows (of Gauls, Romans or your own). There can be a secondary decision, during the winter starvation: which card to discard - usually not a hard one to make. Yet, while only having one type of decision, the considerations about color and symbols are very important, as not only you want to build a bigger row of different colored cards, you also need to manage the amount of amphorae, wheat, grapes, sheeps, olives and coins. The sort of game that provides constant and relevant decisions, albeit not difficulty ones.

[b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b]
- Easy to teach and to play;
- Small and portable;
- Good amount of decisions in the short frame of time of playing it;
- Symbols are easy to tell apart, even across the table.

[b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b]
- The art and graphic design are amateurish at best;
- Setting up the deck at the start (or separating everything at the end) by type and level, is a hassle;
- Not truly thematic - more an abstract game.

[b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b]
In a very light competition. The fight for majorities tend to be more fierce because is easy to control and doesn't depend on color.

In a 2 player game, control will be greater, but competition won't. With 3 or 4 players, some symbols will become better (like wheat - in order to take better cards sooner) and the battle for colors and symbols will be more intense, however, luck might play a bigger part and the game itself will be less fulfilling, specially in 4, since players will simply play less turns and there will be less to be done.

In the end, the game provides a neat environment in a small set of rules. Decisions matter, even if not exactly hard to be made; there are competition, but without bashing or take that; the artwork is pretty weak, yet the design of the symbols does its job; the theme doesn't truly surface or matters, however, it has some thematic reasoning for the mechanics. [thing=67285][/thing] is a flawed game, one that might bore some people, as it lacks excitement, twists and direct conflict; but it does provide enough to entertain every now and then.

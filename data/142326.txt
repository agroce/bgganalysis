Where has Ryan Laukat been? His game designs are great for our game shelf and bad for my wallet. This is a great little area control game that has too much going for it to qualify it as a filler... and yet that's what it is.

RATING: 8.5
I love drafting Tableus (with powers that are cumulative)
And I love Area control games 
(I've played 2 other games that do this combo, Blood Rage and Quantum albeit with less cards for the combos, but it gives me the same feeling)

This ones faster and lighter than both, while retaining enough meat to give me and Rahdo a feeling of deep choices.

Love it.

A red raven production by a designer I like named Ryan Lauket. Eight Minute Empire Legends felt like a new better version of the original Eight Minute Empire for those who have played the original, this is a better game. It is a tactical area control game with a card drafting and set collection element that drives the types of actions you can take on a given round. The game sets up differently every time because you assemble four mini boards into a larger one in a random configuration. Artistically and component wise this game is on another level. The boards are all beautiful landscapes, the little wooden citadels for cities are cool, and the cards are really nice. Even the colors of the cubes seem to have been taken into consideration in terms of how they pop on the boards. The only thing about the game that some might find frustrating is it actually is more like 28 minute empire as that is how long a typical four player game takes. Still, I find it is an easy teach and doesn't over stay its welcome. Definitely worth owning and playing from time to time.

1st play: I kinda stumbled through the first time, not having a sense of what cards are where and how the game would play out. Visually the game was appealing and we played start to finish in maybe 30 minutes, including rules instruction. 

2nd play: Knowing how everything played out, I had a much better sense of the game. I was able to capitalize on different areas of the map, setting up cities and finding synergies in the cards. 

I could see some improvements in balancing the player powers, and some of the add-ons like warp portals and citadels add some variability, but overall, the game was fun as a "waiting for people to arrive" game.

RATING: 7
There's nothing particularly new here; area control, choosing cards from a row that escalates in price, set collection and those cards providing both immediate action and lasting powers or bonuses.  Nonetheless, Eight-Minute Empire Legends assembles these elements into a package that is highly interactive, light on rules and presents some difficult decisions.  Those decisions centre on the selection of cards for their immediate actions (which improve your board position), longer term benefits (such as wings that reduce the cost of crossing water), or to increase a bonus score. Sometimes, preventing an opponent from doing one of those things is the best play.  Money is also an important factor - you start poor and get poorer.  Running out drastically reduces your options.  Altogether a neat little package which achieves a lot with a few simple elements.

Production quality is excellent.  The artwork is mostly very pleasing.  The rules are clear and complete.

Surprising depth for a game that plays in 20 minutes.  Simple area control, that is straight and to the point.

While the art is nice, I do feel it could be just a LITTLE more polished.

Also, the game has too many 'optional' rules.  Arguing over which of these 'optional' rules to use unnecessarily slows the game down - better if it just laid out that you should use all of them, and only leave in the ones that are really fun.

Hú ez lehet hogy még a sima 8 percesnél is jobban tetszik! Variancia sokkal nagyobb, és a hősök (mindenkinek van valami speciális képessége) hangulatot is visznek bele. A tábla elrendezése is változatosabb, több fajta jelölő kerülhet a térképre, és a kártyákon most már áruk helyett egész változatos dolgokat kapunk hosszú távra (pontokat más kártyák után, vagy különböző képességeket). Ez így sokkal nehezebb, kombózhatóbb játék lett, az eredetit teljes egészében magasabb szintre emelték (amellett, hogy az alapkoncepciót érintetlenül hagyták), így akinek a sima 8 perces birodalom tetszik, semmiképp se hagyja ki ezt! Az eredeti talán letisztultabb, és a téma is földhözragadtabb, bevezető családinak mindenképp inkább azt, de ha rácuppan a család, akkor ez is jöhet, mert ebben több mélység van, és a Lost Lands kieggel meg rengeteg módon játszható a játék. Végtelenek a lehetőségek!

Nem tudom, hogy az alap vagy a kieg dobozából került-e elő, de a győzelmi pont számláló lapka tetszett:) Azt hiszem az alapban volt, tehát a Legendsben és nem a Lost Landsban.

RATING: 7.5
A surprisingly deep filler that plays in as much as 20 minutes (the advertised eight are a bit optimistic), and is jam packed of meaningful decisions.

The game is as simple as drafting a certain number of cards from a central row (TTA-style), with each card granting an immediate power (put troops on the map, move troops, put a city on the map) and a lasting power (scoring related or troop related).

On the map each player tries to achieve majorities to score points, but often the card combos give a comparable amount of points, so the choices are though and interesting.

One of my friends called it "El Piccolo" (that's the Italian word for "little", as opposed to El Grande), and I am quite sure he nailed it...

Just had my first play of this today - really easy to get into and while we didn't finish in 8 minutes (not surprising on first playthrough), it was still very quick (maybe 25 minutes.)

I like the theme and it's a nice simple army placement, card driven game.  We had plenty of "oh that's what I should have done" moments in the first game, can't wait to give it another play.

A great little number for downtime or when you only have limited time to play something.

Quick area control game in a small box with gorgeous artwork by Ryan Laukat himself (the game designer, also the designer of Above and Below). Variable set-up to ensure the game doesn't get stale with repeated plays. I'll pull this out more frequently if not for the fact that my favourite area control game is Small World and I end up always choosing that over this.

Very good light area control.  Feels like El Grande but lighter, in a shorter time, and works well with fewer players.  Actually seems like something that should have been done sooner (maybe there are other light area control like this but I just haven't encountered them?).  It really needs to be played with the variants added, preferably more than one, otherwise it is a little dry.

Interesting concept and a neat spin on Vinci/Small World. My only concern is the reported imbalance of some of the cards. Evidence that the development process really matters: it's impossible for a designer to get it all right himself. These small press games suffer from lack of development (not that having a developer is a sure-fire guarantee that everything will turn out right...) and it shows. It's a shame as it is a beautiful game and clever concept that takes some of the best parts of Vinci/Small World and distills down to an attractive, inexpensive package with a pretty neat decision space.

A fun area control game with an interesting Through-the-Ages-style action mechanic. The special powers of the cards make EME: Legends much better than its previous version, especially with the bonus tokens (warp tokens, dragon, curse, etc.), although I liked the variable set collection element of the original EME, and wish it was more prominent here (with resource cards other than the crystals). I managed to acquire a second set, so I might try a "mega" version with eight boards and twice the armies. I'll report back if it's any good.

First off: I appreciate the switch to the fantasy theme, mightily. During our first game when the unicorn card was revealed, my friend and I gasped loudly in perfect unison. Because unicorns are rad, my friends.

Second this game is obviously aesthetically superior to its predecessor. The art on the cards is lovely and even the cube colors are super gorgeous.

Gameplay wise, this is a little odd to compare to the original. Because they're so very similar, yet different.

In a nutshell, Legends takes the basic gameplay of EME and downplays the set collection aspect (which still exists) and adds in combo-building. And a variable map. As such, the choices are far less straightforward and it's hard to look at everyone's spread and figure out who's in a better position with their cards at any time. The choices feel a little more interesting here, which about doubles the length of the game.

But there was an elegance to the simplicity of the original game that feels missing here. EME was impressive because it did so much with SO little. Your choices were fairly straightforward, but no less agonizing for it. And even though the map didn't change every time, every game played very differently based on the cards that came up. The game moves so fast that you can't wait for the right card to start your play, you have to work with what you're given. That's true here as well, but I think it just goes to show that building the map is more novelty and less necessity.

So which should you get? I think it depends on your preference. For something that feels a little more interesting and more aesthetically pleasing, go with Legends. But if you want a shorter game that's more straightforward but still packs a lot of depth and tough choices, go with the original.

EME:L is marginally better than the basic game. For sure, there are many other aspects of the game you now need to consider as there are more mechanisms. The cards are definitely more interesting than in the regular game as they give you special powers, but on the other hand the focus on set selection is lower. There are cool abilities (flying, for instance), and the various tokens meant that the gameplay felt a little more open. Still, it doesn’t take 8 minutes to play, but for a game that lasts about 20 minutes it’s okay, although the scores seem very even and small margins will probably decide the game.

Could be a very good game for taking away on trips. Replacing the set collecting mechanics of the cards with thematic and keyword-based effects allows for more of Ryan's art - always a good thing - but the modular design of the map with the exploration tokens is really what makes it shine over its earlier counterpart.It is a shame there are only six, but... it is still a microgame that looks to pack in a decent amount of gameplay.

A Rattus for grown-ups.
Much deeper but somewhat easier to strategize.
The set collection mechanic coupled with the many paths to victory is SO well done.
This game has ALOT to offer in such a tiny package.
It's impressive and it looks very good.
A great game!!

I really liked the idea of this game and was excited to teach it to some of my friends, thinking it would get played all the time. Much to the contrary, each time I have played this game has resulted in more or less indifference. Not terrible, but no one has been enthralled and wanted to play it again right away. Currently own it, but will probably trade it in soon.

This one has dropped a little for me. And for whatever reason, moving up to four players really seems to bog this game down.

[September 2014 - 7.5]
I always forget how good of a little game this is. Three players is best. I seem to get distracted by the board battles, rather than pay attention to the cards, which play a big role. Haven't played beyond the base game yet.

A quite different game from the basic one. I might well end up buying both.

I think I'd prefer this one if really forced to choose as I like the modular setup and card powers. 

Most of the variants included don't add much value as I see it. The leaders force you into certain paths and the hidden tokens are not worth the hassle. I do like the three Citadel tokens that gives you 1 VP extra. Adds something to fight about.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Players spend about 10 turns sculpting an empire on a module board.  Simple, ultra-fluffy area control game, where players on their turn draft a card.  The card gives them an immediate action, and some on going power/end of game scoring bonus.

The actions involve moving cubes around the board, placing new cubes, founding cities, and so on.  The game ends when every player has obtained around 10 cards, and points are awarded for majorities and bonuses.

Harmless fun - plays like El Grande Express.  Nicely produced, easy to teach.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Nice, quick little territory game. Some of the rules could be clearer (especially some of the leaders special ability) but nonetheless fun. Not too long even if some might find that it ends just when the game is about to start. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
My wife and I enjoyed this, but the 8 minute claim is laughable. We havens't tried any of the varients, although they look interesting. I have a hard time figuring out my best option (i.e. not totally intuitive to me), so I end up using the trial and error game play strategy. 

The game may be a little too restrictive for my tastes; however, (after misreading the rules), we played thinking that you get the bonus each round, even if you don't select a card with that ability. I think I may enjoy this version more since it loosens up the game somewhat.

The art is gorgeous and it's very easy to play once you understand how it works. 
It's not a high tension game, there is no adrenaline rush or epic clash of forces which is a little disappointing, but if you accept it for the beautiful and calm game that it is it's quite nice.
I've never used the extras for the game. I suspect they'd only bog down the smooth flow of play.

Eight Minutes? No. Empire? No. Fantastic little area control game with a fun central mechanic? Yeppers. Just a nice, light little game that has a lot going for it. Solid is the best one word to describe it. Compared to the original Legends add more stuff like variable boards, leader powers, has been expanded with Lost Lands. I fear that it might collapse in sooner rather than later with just too much going on if more stuff keeps coming out causing it to lose the tight focus of the original.

More going on vs the original. Cards build power up effects are more satisfying than simple set collecting powers.

More chaotic than original in control of the victory points. Prefer the single board in original vs the modular board which felt sloppier.

Felt the goal of the game is to have a fast moving easy to teach game (akin to Rattus maybe), and I feel he original hits this better.

Played it only one more time since my rating and it really didn't do anything for me. Despite the gorgeous art and cool pieces, I didn't feel like there was much there. Off the top of my head I can reel off at least 7 fillers that give me a really great experience. Have no desire to play this one. Traded and dropped the rating.

A nice enough filler style area control, card drafting, set collection game, but we own games that represent all categories better than this one.
:thumbsup: lovely artwork, excellent components
:thumbsdown: I don't like games where you leave out a whole bunch of cards/components when playing with less players or where cards are made for a specific number of players*. If I only ever play this game 2 player, then it's a waste to have 3 player cards and 4 player cards. I prefer that you shuffle all cards and remove a set number. That way you have a likelihood to play with all the cards in the game. A disappointment.

RATING: 6
I found it much more interesting than the original EME as the cards offered better choices such that it wasn't just about building cities. I recall movement being so onerous in the original that you needed to build cities and players who didn't really suffered. So, it’s an improvement in that regard and a reasonably nice evening ender that I wouldn’t mind picking up for a reasonable price, but the buzz has this one at nearly $40 which seems twice the amount of game in the box. Also, as another commenter noted, it’s closer to 8 minutes per person than total, so go in with that understanding.

Eight Minute Empire: Legends in a nice introduction to area control.  Very easy rules with variants to add a little more complication and strategy to it.

This game is not very in your face so if you have people uneasy about direct conflict, it feels more like cube shuffling.

Stunning beautiful game, very easy to teach, plays all player counts but 3-4 is definitely more interesting.  A lot of game in a small box.

A word from the wise, money does not come easily, be frugal with your coins because there is slight odds you will get any back!

Love this little area control game. That said, suffers from weird rules and a poorly written rulebook. We did some extensive house ruling to make it flow better. 

Collection Notes: we also own the Lost Lands expansion

I don't normally comment on expansions but: I don't care what Ryan said on bgg forums, you can indeed play with the expansion components with the old card buying system. It works even better if you use the same mechanism that Century: Spice Road does where players put a coin on each card in front of the one they purchase and then players who take those cards get those coins.

A beautiful and quick game that teaches the principles of area control, tableau-building, set collection, and card/pool bidding to newcomers while still offering a satisfying and engaging gaming experience.

A kártyaképességekkel sikerült egy sokkal érdekesebb játékot csinálni, mint az alap, pedig az se volt rossz. Így sokkal több dolgot kell mérlegelni, nehezebbek a döntések. Az is jó, hogy nincs már külön vízenmozgás, mert nagyon be lehetett amiatt szorulni, ha nem jött. A szerepek nem annyira tetszettek, mert a pénzlopóssal tönkre lehet vágni valakinek a játékát, a többi meg nem tűnt, annyira meghatározónak. Illetve még fura néhány kártya pontozása. Nem annyira jó szerintem egy ilyen játéknál az ilyen szerezd meg a két kártyából mind a kettőt és akkor kapsz három pontot. 
Összességében nagyon tetszett, kár, hogy a hazai ára a nagydobozos játékokéval versenyez.

After a first session of playing this I am really positive. The premise is simple, the rules are intuitive and can be explained in less than 10 minutes and there seems to be more than enough strategic depth.

The first strategic aspect is the choice of what card to buy each turn. The choice is never easy, do you go for that expensive card everyone's after, do you deny your opponents a card or do you save money for later?

Then there's the board to consider, what regions and islands will you conquer, and how? Where will you build your cities?

The modular board is great for creating a varied game, you can build 98304 different T-shaped boards, 172032 if you admit square and line shaped ones as well. On top of that you can add in explore tokens and citadels and use the leaders for even more variation. I honestly can not see this game go stale. You can finish every game in less than an hour, even with four players, which is a big plus.

The cards and board look amazing and everything fits neatly in the box.

I strongly recommend this! I will maybe write a more extensive review once I have played some more games.

I wanted to try Eight Minute Empires: Legends after playing a number of Laukaut games and figuring out that I think the original 8ME is probably the best out of all of them. Playing this though- I wonder if I like the original still more than this one. I found the game tried to add more to something that really should stay where it is. 8ME is quick, easy, and somewhat brainless, but still creates a feeling of competitiveness that is nice for a fast filler. 'Legends' is clearly supposed to be a filler as well, but what it adds in supposed depth I find just increases the luck factor. The conflict that makes 8ME interesting is there, but then a number of extra bonus points are also available and some can be controlled for and some are rather lucky.  I wasn't even planning on getting large VP bonus points, but I managed without trying to purchase all the right cards. Anyway, it is okay, but I imagine I'm one of the odd ones who likes the original slightly better.

Good filler.  Being Ameritrashers at heart, my son and I feel like there aren't enough attack options in the game. Point turnovers mostly happen through more passive aggressive (Euro) area control methods, which is... ok.  Just not quite as actively aggressive as we would like.

Eight-Minute Empire: Legends and then another game with the Eight-Minute Empire: Lost Lands expansion. It was universally agreed that the base game was amazing, everyone was blown away by how much game there is with so few pieces, its like a short game of "go" with theme. The card drafting part of the game was tension and full of tough decisions and the area control area of the game is also full of options. Do you compete with the competition or do you strike out to that far away island, should be specialize in a certain type of card or spread yourself thin for a tactical advantage this turn. All this in a tiny game and they managed a randomize setup that adds a ton of replayability. I can't say enough good things about this game.

Did I mention the art, is amazing as well.

Wow... so much game in a small box.  This one is really growing on me.  We've only played the basic game twice and I'm already starting to feel my gears turning.  Can't wait to add the leaders and exploration tokens and dragon, etc.

UPDATE: Read through the rules again and we did a few things wrong.  You cannot remove armies from a region if you don't have your own army in that region.  Cities count as an army when calculating control of a region.  And the ability at the top of the card you just bought doesn't trigger unless the action at the bottom of the card matches it.  The rules are poorly worded here.  Could have benefited from a little better phrasing.

Very nice quick game. There is a fair amount of thought especially toward the end. It could be a massive board, grand empire game with tons of special abilities, instead it is just a "wee" one. And a nice one at that. Great filler.

Much more beautiful than it's predecessor. Basically it's "El grande mini". You've select action cards, the ones further down the line for more & vie for majority in a couple of regions.

Great artwork, very quick, gives you the feel of a longer game but plays in about 25-30 min. Top!

Well, they [i]lied[/i]. :P

It doesn't take eight-minutes! It was more like 20 minutes, but a fun 20 minutes at that. (Maybe with some more plays we can get it down to eight-minutes, but I doubt it.)

An area control game, mixed with card drafting for ten turns, is reminiscent of a stripped-down El Grande and Risk. Tight money, meaningful decisions, interesting powers, very little conflict (and thus somewhat amiable to non-wargamer types), geomorphic maps, and quick play makes for a pleasant game that packs a lot of punch, in such a "little" box.

Production quality is top-notch. The graphics are excellent. The cards are high-quality, with lush art work.

For the given play time, it may make for a simple filler, but it seems to offer so much more, especially with the richly detailed theme. It is quite immersive, such that I would like to stay here for several plays to fully explore [i]this[/i] world. I've never played the original Eight-Minute Empire, but the designer is on to something here. It may be the equivalent of a modern-day "Microgame" that Metagaming (Steve Jackson's first company that put out Ogre) made popular back in the late 1970s, but not solely due to the size of the package, but in the fun-to-package ratio. It's a solid "8".

An improvement over the original (IMO), it does away with the resource-based set collection, replacing the resources with special abilities and the set collection with, well, more set collection. I like it, but it doesn't feel nearly as different as I expected it to, when I read the rules.

A terrific med to light area control game that plays equally well with all player counts. The artwork is a gorgeous hand-drawn style that evokes old story books, but of course the heart of the game is in the card-based gameplay, and it doesn't disappoint. The mechanics are tight and decisions are meaningful while not being overwhelming. This is a great next-step-up from gateway games.

It may not actually play in eight minutes, but Eight-Minute Empire: Legends is a great way to scratch the itch to play an area control game in about 30 minutes or less. The game's greatest asset is having to purchase cards that dictate what a player can do on one's turn (and, in turn, managing the money used to purchase these cards). That, combined with the ability to combine cards for points and more powerful abilities (the latter being a nice improvement over its predecessor) and the ability to set up the game into many starting configurations, is what elevates the game into a solid tactical experience with quite a bit of replayability.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is more like 20 Minute per person Legends. However, still a decent game. It's really just a game to quickly claim territory. There's only 10 turns. Generally a turn consists of either moving or of adding new units. So, it's quick. Select a card, Flip a card, execute the action. Repeat 9 more times.

This game is really interesting. It takes a pretty standard area control game and augments it with a very light set collection game—and together they make a really fun experience. It'll take a few plays to really grasp the strategy, because of the limited number of each action available (and the random order in which they appear). Great, fast fun.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (July 2014)

A much better game than its predecessor. It improves over it in many ways. I love the modular board, it gives a lot of replayability as each game develops in a different world. I really like the new setup. This time you begin in TWO locations (the best improvement IMO). This small change allows for non-obvious decisions (as was the case in regular 8 Minute Empire) and adds a little meat to the game. I approve of the new gorgeous art and the new cards. They seem a lot better and now you can really make combos with them. Also love that some cards affect the gameplay right away. I also approve with the removal of the "moving over ocean" action and the removal of the fifth player. Legends also has very interesting variants. Another good change was the destroy action, in Legends you can destroy an army of another player only if you also have armies in the same region. Much more thematic this way. That wasn’t the case before. I seem to remember than in vanilla 8 Minute Empires there were only 2 destroy army cards and in Legends there are more so there is more interaction (of this kind) between players. 

The core game remains similar though (easy to learn and quick to play but not in 8 minutes!) and I still I don’t see the advantage of going first and bidding for this privilege. For me, going last is a lot better tactically as your opponents have a decreased response factor, that is, they have less turns to respond and in the very last turn you can go rampage without any fear of retribution (if the cards let you and they usually do).

The game components are ok. The cities are and look GREAT, another improvement over the previous game.

In conclusion, a much better game than I was expecting. I already sold 8 Minutes Empire but I’m thinking of hanging onto this copy (although lighter than I prefer), at least for a while. I plan to play with the variants soon. As it stands 8 Minute Empire: Legends is a borderline 6.0 for me.

Pretty impressed with this in the filler category.  Obviously, not alot of choices but that's one of the reasons it plays so quickly.  Like the set collection from an auction game without the auction, the money and movement opportunities are tight enough to keep it interesting.  I don't know if its long-term great game but I'll get my money's worth from it easily.  (Would more terrain boards or more cards in an expansion extend it, yes, probably....)

Finally got the game from the Kickstarter, and it's really pretty. It's also a lot of fun (for me), and comes with a lot of variants in the box (including special rules on certain map boards, which I didn't know about until they arrived).

Pros: 
- Very, very pretty and compact
- Easy to explain
- Lots of variability in the game

Cons:
- Some luck in the card ordering. The shuffle can swing games by 2-3 points
- Certain finer points in the variants and special maps are not totally clear.

I liked Eight-Minute Empire and I like its successor. Legends is an evolution and probably a bit better but essentially it's the same game. 

The immediate effects of the cards remained. Instead of automatic set collection points by goods printed on the cards, the special abilities of some cards now give points for certain other cards. Other cards improve the basic actions or grant a new ability. The good news is that Legends doesn't feel any more complex than its predecessor. 

Luck might play an even larger role in Legends. There are so many bonus points to be collected now that the amount of bonus points easily can be higher than the points gathered by area control. The importance of cards showing up at the right time is increased.

Still the quickest way to experience area control in a limited time frame. There are hardly any other games out that provide more in less time.

Reminds a little of El Grande, but can hold it's own very well. It's impressive how much content the designer put into this small box and how well all the content is balanced. The game plays very fast with 4 players, approximately 20 to 30 minutes per game. It's extremely portable and a must have for casual players, which won't have the time to do play a 2-3 hour game of El Grande (my other favorite area control game of course ;)) but still want to have a deep an brain teasing game where you have do your best every turn or loose everything. Didn't play with the variants currently, but I am sure at least the leaders will put up considerable amount of variation. Oh and a last thing: The four modular boards are great, they are not only doublesided, but they also incorporate different concepts/variants itself, like the desert which is easily attackable from more than one adjacent region and some kind of jungle with three different islands that are connected in a way that you do need only one movement points. Very very clever game, absolutely worth every cent!

A simple area majority game where you disperse cubes from a central position and draft cards for actions, points and privileges.

A fun game no doubt, but there are a couple balancing issues that NEED to be house ruled.  

(in our plays) Dire Giant blocks 1 attack, not all attacks.. and the bandit king is banned.  If we want 4 abilities we'll have 2 of one of the other Characters.

other than that it's a nice light area control game.
However I do think Tiny Epic Kingdoms, is a far superior game.

Eight-Minute Empire set in the fantasy world. More ways to score but more rules to keep in mind (and, by consequence, it takes longer). Actually, I like a couple of rule changes from the original version. Now, you use 3 "generic" (i.e., not specific to the sea") movement points to cross over the ocean, and you need to have at least an army in the same region to destroy another player's army.

I love Eight-Minute Empire and I love this, but I'm not sure it's an improvement. Replacing the set collection of the original with extra powers is definitely an improvement because it creates interlocking mechanics. I didn't like the modular board though, nor the special little rules that were added. I'd most like to play original game with the cards of this one, but I don't think that would work.

Fun area control game that reminds me of Barony (which I also like). Lots of flexibility in the small box, including double sided boards, variant tiles and character cards.  I like the card drivin action mechanic when you buy the card, and then the engine building mechanic for future turns.  Great decisions about which to card to buy.....Should you select a card that allows you to add armies, build a city, match card types, move armies, etc?  Very limited money to start, so plan accordingly or you'll be taking cards you don't want late in the game.

It's a small interesting game that looks much better than the original 8 minute empire game. The modular board and optional rules also makes it more appealing.

I like the components, the board and even the artwork. It's the kind of art I would like to be able to do in the future.

We played with 4 players and I found that the game ended too short and lacked of climax. Apparently with less players you played more turn.

Else, I think with the components of this game, you could make an alternate conquest game where you expand your kingdom and fight opponent.

I really like the component selections. It seems simple enough to be able to make other games out of it. Might give ideas for a game of mine.

For all of those out there who are contemplating paying ridiculous amounts of money for copies of El Grande while it is OOP, you should really stop and do yourself a favor and instead pick up Eight Minute Empires: Legends. Honestly I might even suggest that you just skip El Grande altogether and go with 8ME:L because honestly it does the exact some thing, and has the exact some tension and feelings that you would get with El Grande. Don't get me wrong, I love me some El Grande and would never ever turn down a game of El Grande, but 8ME:L just seems to scratch that same itch in a much tighter package. As the name suggests there is really no room for superfluous anything in this game, and it comes through with flying colors. And suprisingly being so short it doesn't even suffer from "the game is over just as it starts to get interesting" problem a lot of the short games suffer from. This is definitely one of the fine jewels that has come out of the vast mines of Kickstarter. Do yourself a solid and pick it up as soon as you can.

Not a bad little game, though the name is something of a misnomer. Not merely the fact that it takes more than eight minutes to play, but that I really didn't feel like I had much of an "empire". As a quick and dirty little area control game, it was a fun enough time.

Eight minutes is putting it a bit optimistically, but that's okay -- this one was so much fun we wished it had lasted longer.  It's a clever enough area control mechanic, with some interesting rules to keep you on your toes.  The variant rules are simple enough to use right out of the gate, and it's plenty competitive.  Easy to set up, but the different maps present a challenge; it really works quite well despite a basically short learning curve.

The design is good, the fantasy theme is more evocative than most, and best of all, the art is just gorgeous (unusually, the graphics are by the game designer himself).  It's really lovely to look at, and combined with some solid play, it makes for a game I'm eager to revisit soon.

While I wish there were more cards in this game (you will run through almost all of them each game),  this game has ton of subtleties for optimization (e.g. have their been too many movement cards taken that I need to start focusing on them? How useful will that permanent bonus be compared to this really powerful single-use effect?), and so has a pretty good level of strategy for a 20 minute area majority filler (no it doesn't actually play in 8 minutes unfortunately). I really like the bonuses of the leader cards although the Bandit King seems really strong, and wish that there were more choices. The different sides of the board add a little bit of variety but it's not huge, and while I have not gotten to play with the tokens yet I imagine they will just be a small bonus too. Note that you will get a large share of points from set collection too, so make sure to deny your opponents key cards.

Very light and quick strategy game. This is fun but my biggest complaint is the limitation on army sizes.  There doesn't seem to be enough combat cards and it is very easy to build a large army to take control land but there's very little back and forth. It is usually just whoever can spread out most efficiently. I understand that is the entire premise of "Area Control" but I would have liked more battles and control of land changing hands.

This game is better playing with all the extra tokens (like the explore tokens, citadels, portals).  Not sure how I feel about the leaders though as some seem a lot better than others.

As a filler game, this is a simple majority control game where you can take cards that allow you to put out new armies, move existing armies or build cities.

Similar to the base game, this new version removed the resources and replaced them by various bonuses such as extra moves, extra armies, cheaper movement over water, and scoring points for types of cards. Overall the change is minimal but provides more variety. The extra tokens are also quite nice for playing with more options.

Good game, definitely replaced the 'standard' 8-minute empire, short yet with enough depth (can be used as a filler  or 'normal' game), additional tiles (warps, dragon,...) and cards makes this a highly modular game where some choice of difficulty level is possible. Recommended!

Light area control and card drafting. I usually dislike area control as it requires direct confrontation, and I'm not very aggressive. But EME:L shrouds it in a clever card draft that gives you bonuses as well as selecting actions, and the map is large enough that I usually have little problem fighting for what I need. And the art is gorgeous.

The overall gameplay has potential, but it just fell flat for me. The end is kind of anticlimactic and the cards don't offer as many choices as I'd prefer. I have only played the game with four players, but each time I was never able to do as much as I'd like to, even for a shorter game. You only get 8 actions in a four player game which seems to not be enough for what the game seems like it would have. I will have to play it again with 2 or 3 players, but I was a bit disappointed in the four player game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It feels a bit like you're doing accounting on the map, just trying to get one more army than your opponents in a particular region to control it for victory points. The only "combat" is removing an opponent's cube from a region--no action, no drama, just pick up the cube and put it back in the player's supply. I'm not saying the game is bad, but it's definitely not as action-packed as one would imagine a fantasy-themed dudes-on-a-map game would be. The variants won't change that, but they do look like providing some variability and variety that would improve the base game, so we'll definitely try those.

This is just a fantastic little game all around.  The mechanics are smooth and keeps play moving at a brisk pace.  Great game as a filler or to play with the kids.  Adding in the special tiles/tokens can provide some neat ways to shake up the game.  Takes what could be a big huge area control / empire building game and distills it down to a tiny package.  A definite favorite of mine.

Off balance, a bit of a pointless affair of moving cubes around. Huge advantage if you can build a city in turn one. Two players could, two couldn't. Finishing order was decided after these first player actions. And 8 minutes? This takes 35 with all the chrome added. The original was simple enough for 15 minutes, this really overstays its welcome.

While I am not a fan of Area Control Games I really like this game. I am terrible at it, lost every time I have played it so far... but still really enjoy it. Easy, quick to learn, quick to play, and has a lot of strategy.  I thought I finally had a win with my last game, and lost in the tie-breaker.
Going last seems to be too large of an advantage.

This one is fine, better than I rate it, but I've played it a few times and it just feels a bit unsubstantial. Too much focus on comboing cards for points, not enough focus on clever board play I suspect is my main issue. The idea of buy/drafting the available actions is a neat mechanic that I hope someone runs with in a larger game (if it hasn't been done already?).

Playtime is not eight, but twenty which is fine. Also, it is a bit boring with 2, better with 3, and better still with 4, but at no point would I not rather just play say Carcassonne so meh.

A fine game.

There is a lot of meat in such a small game both in components and play time. It's quite simple to play, not within 8 minutes, but rather 20-30 minutes (maybe the 8 minute per player is quite right). Highly recommended area control game that plays in a quarter or less of the time than other games in the genre.

Great game with a lot of meat for a filler and takes up very little time and space (playing and storing on the shelf). I've been slowly introducing more of the expansions in the base box and have bought the expansion for more game, but also for more players as my group has grown.

I'm excited by the drafting mechanic in the expansion, but also cautious of how fiddly it will be as you must keep the cards in order.

Extremely bland and uninteresting area control game. I'll admit that I really dig the art style, but the game is just boring and extremely simplistic. Seems to play at its best with three, because it's too easy to run out of units at two, and with four there's too much of a clump that develops due to there not being enough castle placement cards to go around. Also, the special locations feel really tacked-on, and aren't really all that special. Games like this make me wish we could get better area control games, and not just more fluff like this.

I thought this games primary claim to fame was that it was quick but I didn't realize how incredibly good it would be. Based on reading about, looking at, and seeing the original I can tell I'm happy to only get this one since it seems to have a more fantasy flavor, modular board, more variants, and subjectively more interesting use of cards. I'm sure the original is great too though.

Though I wish I could replace the cubes (not a huge gripe but it made Lords of Waterdeep better), this is hands down great. This game combines the most fun and strategic elements of card drafting and area control into such a nice clean package that actually is loaded with strategy. The layers and depth of strategy in this game are huge. It's length at about 15-20 minutes unless you're really rushing is great.

This game boils down the most fun and interesting elements of area control into their most pure form and in the purity of this game, there's real fun to be had. The strategies and things to think about are huge and dynamic, there's very little luck factor, and certainly none in any way that makes it less fun. I'm just surprised by how fun and strategic this game managed to be, even for new players or the players who are losing. Making decisions in this game is meaningful and important and yet because of it's quickness/lightness, there's no huge downtime irritation or analysis paralysis even with slower players who often stretch out otherwise fast/dynamic games.

If you just want to play a great, easy to travel with, easy to play at lunch short game (not quite a filler unless you really rush but other people use the word filler much more loosely such as for any game less than an hour or half hour. For me, cthulu dice is a filler)

I can't think of any demographic of gamers or even non gamers who will be disappointed by this game. I think you will like it no matter who you are.

UPDATE: I've now played all the variants. I like the identity variant the most. The other variants are not bad and do add some fun and changes but for a game with an otherwise easy set up, it generally seems better to play without any variants that add to the set up unless you're really hungering for a change. It's nice that they provide this option though.

I like almost everything about this short, empire-building game. The added complexity here compared to the original Eight-Minute Empire is clearly an improvement in my mind.

One of my favorite fillers - although it almost feels meaty enough to escape that label.

The expansion isn't necessary, but adds more cards (a good thing) and provides an interesting variant for card drafting instead of the purchasing system in the base game.

Debated rating this higher; still might after more play.

--- Preliminary thoughts ---

Simple and fast area control game with a couple of additional mechanisms (set collection, variable actions).

It also add several optional rules that add a tiny bit of complexity anmd more replayability.

Improves upon the original Eight-Minute Empire game while adding a fantasy theme. Now that you have this one available, I see no reason to buy the original anymore!

I enjoy it, although the "eight-minute" part is a stretch. :)  Even so, the games don't feel like they last long enough - I'd prefer they be a little bit longer.  But the game play is great - we added a homebrew rule for money making that gave us a little more flexibility in card selection.

Great game, easy to learn.  Piece of cake to pick up, but enough strategy that you need to think through your next move and pay attention to what everyone else is doing to be successful.

Lots of nice decisions packed into a 20 minute game, allowing this to enter good opener territory. Buy a card from the draft. The ability on the bottom will allow you to place cubes out to the map, move cubes, destroy an opponent's cube or create a new spawning point, all of which aimed at controlling as many regions and islands as possible. Making it an area majorities game, but the best kind ... a short one. The top of the card has an ongoing benefit, be it end of game scoring, or an extra placement/move each time you do a placement/move, that kind of thing. So you're trying to buy cards that give you exactly what you need to do on the map right now (eg if I've placed a lot recently, I'll want to move them) plus a complementary long term benefit. Turns are fast, it's usually a pretty easy decision which card to buy, but money is tight so you can't always get the card you want (most recently added is most expensive, as normal), hoping it'll still be there next turn. 10 turns, 10 cards, 10 actions and it's all over, count 'em up. Nice boards, which allow different maps each game. Easy to teach, easy to play, fills its niche well.

This game fired Rattus for me.  For a quick area control game, EME: Legends does a much better job.  The cards are well done and it is agonizing and fun to decide which cards to add to your tableau as you need to constantly consider and balance long term as well as short term benefits.  The included variants provide a wealth of variety.  Overall a great game in a small box.

If there is a knock at all on the game, it's that sometimes it may be too strong to go last.  If the player who goes last can purchase a 5 or 6 movement card and he/she has cards with extra movements, that player can take over numerous territories swinging the game in their favor.  Of course, since that player is last, a move like this cannot be countered.  So, it is certainly something to watch for.

Good area control game with card selection.  The rules of movement or placement were easy to follow on the cards.  I liked the different scoring paths of controlling territories, islands, and having majority in potions.  I liked the random island selection and placement, creating different games.

I thought there were too many dead-ends for the islands and needed better paths between them.  Of course the money seemed too tight for the game and the optimal card was generally known.  Some cards weren't completely open about their meaning.

Variants introduced bit-by-bit and in assorted combinations make for good replayability.

Just like Eight Minute Empire, this game is a thrilling abstraction of everything I love about area control games. This game adds a lot of additional flavor and new mechanics on top of it, making this a varied and interesting experience. Still light, still quick. I enjoy how the designers removed how every card auto-scores which is the case in the original EME. It gives me a reason to hold onto both games.

An ok area majority game. It's small and plays quickly (though definitely longer than 8 minutes), and overall there just isn't much to it. I like the tough decisions about how to spend your very limited coins, but the extreme limitations that the available cards place on your actions are frustrating, especially with how luck-dependent they are in larger player-count games. You can't really pursue a larger strategy, or if you do you just have to hope that the right cards come up at the right times. It's not quite fast enough to have that "one more game" feel that can make very luck-based games work, either.

A rather light Euro game disguised as a fantasy-themed light wargame without the (direct) confrontation and bloated rules. Most of the crux in this game lies in positioning and moving your cubes to gain dominance and majority in specific areas, depending on your VP conditions and cards. The variable leaders add more layers to the tactics without breaking the game, because we are talking about 1, maybe 2 points here. Yet, I found the limited interaction a bit dissapointing. Of course, you can keep your eyes peeled and observe what cards the others are picking and which winning course they are going for but most of the time your are concerned with complimenting your deck with new cards. Also, I found this a tad too light to fill the slot of the main dish in a game night but too complex to be a filler, let alone the fact that it does not bring anything new to the table (the alleged playing time of 8 minutes comes to 8 minutes per person for sure).

REALLY enjoy this one. Its quick, it has area control, card drafting, set collection, and some special abilities thrown in on top. 

I love that the 4 map boards are double sided and you can set them up however you like. I know the rules recommend a t shape but we have set this up all sorts of crazy ways and its really fun. 

Love the variant tokens that come with the game. This game is all thumbs up for me I really enjoy it. Also beautiful art. Big fan of Ryan and Red Raven games.

RATING: 3
The actions that cards a player owns allows him to do is not clear, and represented by symbols one must go and look up when confused instead of lending some text on the cards themselves.  And yes, I could do this or that, but I felt no motivation to care about my decisions or my goals.  I sure did not feel tension.  Either a card was available to draft to allow me to do something to advantage myself or not.  So it wasn't really a matter of my abilities to determine my successes, merely what opportunities were allowed to me by the time the cards had been picked over by my three opponents.

Pretty swingy game where turn order seems to play a bigger role than strategy. It's hard to pursue any sort of long term strategy since it is so easy to to deny players the cards they need. Overall, the game is light and chaotic, but at least Laukat's art makes it visually pleasing and it plays fast enough that I mostly don't mind the lack of strategy.

I enjoyed this, and I'm considering adding it to my collection, but the game didn't feel like there was a ton of area control for being a game about area control.

I think part of that was I was playing it 2 players, so for the most part we were able to use movement cards to spread out to the whole board and only had a few extra movement points to vie for control over 3 or 4 regions. I imagine with more players this would be significantly tighter, so I'm eager to play it with more.

I don't really think it's worth playing 2 player though, without some tweaks to the rules or one or two less boards to tighten up the map.

I also worry that I may have seen pretty much all I need to see with one play. It seems like while there's variability, there might not be enough meat to it to keep it interesting for multiple plays. I don't know this for sure, that's just the feeling I got after my first play.

Another Laukat gem and another refreshing take on familiar mechanics. 8M:Legends is a strategic area control wargame, but without all the tropes of the genre. Instead, the game allows you to buy cards, which give you actions. These cards eventually form your deck, making combinations with their types, accessories and boons on the cards. And that's only the basic mechanics. 

A solid and deep 'filler' game, that will see definitely see more play in the future.

Some area majority, some set collection, some engine building (kinda) in a very streamlined package. 

But it's ultimately a gamer's filler - basically you get half points by collecting sets and half points from the board play where having an engine helps. But what you mostly do is: optimise. Optimise movements, optimise your spread across the board, optimise your buys. Yes, there is some conflict, which can hinder the opponents a bit, but it's more on the side of the main focus, which is optimising those 8 cards you buy to get the most points out of them. 

Compared to other lightish, filler-ish area control games, this one has a good focus and plays smoothly (so: much better than Rattus).

EDIT - oh, let's make area majority trivial by turning it into an optimisation exercise. Blah. Down to 2.0
EDIT: down to 1.0 because: see above. Why ruin area majority? Why just not make such a game?

RATING: 5
Played once with 4P. I generally appreciate efforts to distil deep gameplay into a quick game with a minimal footprint, but Eight-Minute Empire: Legends doesn't do anything for me. A generally well-designed and lushly-illustrated area control game, it presents a number of elements (such as set collection and drafting) to weigh out when making decisions.

There are several gameplay restrictions to work with – coins and armies are in short supply, and moving across water is inefficient – so the game nudges players into constructing a rudimentary engine to overcome these restrictions. My issue here is that the game ends before anything takes off properly, so it feels more like a short burst of activity rather than a proper game.

But even if I were to accept this as a heavily tactical game, it's not a satisfying affair nor does it have a hook to keep me coming back to it. I'd really rather just allocate more time to play Small World, or a longer area control game over this.

If you don't get hung up on the name, in less than 30 minutes you can get a full area control experience with a nice touch of set collection and almost drafting. My two favorite game mechanisms are area control and clever card use and this game is a phenomenal combination of both. I've been looking for a good introduction to area control games and Carl Chudyk games and this one fits the role perfectly. It also looks very nice so it's definitely a keeper.

A 8 perces birodalom kicsit feltúrbózva. Egyedi, fantasy témájú kártyák és moduláris térképet kapunk ebben a változatban. Többfajta tokent a régiókra, különböző bónuszokkal. Egy-egy személyiséget is kapunk, ezeket nem éreztem teljesen kiegyenlítettnek, de az igaz, hogy nem sokban befolyásolják a játékmenetet. Ezzel kicsit változatosabb, nehezebb a játék, akinek tetszett az alapjáték és kicsi bonyolításra vágyik annak mindenképpen ezt ajánlom, de szerintem jó az előd egyszerűsége is. Egy ponttal azért többet érdemel a szép kivitelezés miatt is.

Good little filler/area control game. I like the idea with Legends, although I think that the leader which takes money from the other players ends up ruining it for the other players because he reduces their possible choices. As there's not that many different leaders in this one, there's a decent possibility you'll play with him, which prevents this from getting a much better rating, as I do enjoy the more gamey aspects of this, since the cards are more than just simple set collection.

Currently I've only played a few games of it, but me and my girlfriend love it for two players (I haven't had the chance to play with more yet).

For our first few plays we decided to go with the barebones game, without any optional variants (explore tokens, spire tokens, encounter tokens and/or character cards) and even this version of the game offers some really hard choises during the card selection and feels very rewarding if your plan works out. 
Of course the changed order of cards already changes every game, but even stuff like changing the map slightly and changing the starting location make a huge difference in how we values certain cards.

Our very first game came down to the 4th tiebreaker.

I already love it and can't wait to play with the optional stuff added in.

[Kickstarter 2013 edition] {Civilization; area-control, card-drafting; optimal 4p} This is a nice filler. However, I don't think my game group can finish this game within 8 minutes easily ^_^

The decisions are tense and the interaction is strong.  This game is highly tactical, subject to luck of draw; however, decision is meaningful and wrong moves can fundamentally kick you out of the game - as such, this game is unforgiving when you have only 8 turns to make.

The quality of game components are great for a small publisher.  I am glad that I pledge for it.

With the variance - this game is fun!

tl;dr: fine game

I played the original [thing=131366][/thing] once when it came out. I remember little about it except liking it and the location I played it.
When I was going to play this game it had to be explained to me as if I never played the original, and I didn't remember anything about it except that it was indeed an area majority game. And it's a fine one. It's not very original, but the way the cards work is pretty nice. I must say I enjoyed it again except that I was annoyed by the lack of choices for the last players on the last turn.
I do however feel like this game could use a slightly bigger board. It becomes messy quite fast with all those cubes coming in. I understand they want to use the compact size as a selling point, but practicalities should come first.

Although eight minutes is a generous estimate, the game does live up to the promise of an enjoyable game in a very short play-time. Having never played the original, "Legends" was my introduction to the system, and based on a little research I'm glad I entered here. The game strikes the correct balance between interesting decisions and perfect play-time (for what it is).

The goal is simple: area control. You gain points by having the most dudes on the map in each area, and in each continent. The more you control, the better you do. Turns are equally simple: choose and pay for a card from among the face-up option and do whatever it says. This may involve placing new dudes on the map, moving existing dudes, or some other special power. Once complete, cards are kept in front of you, and may help increase the power of future actions if you can manage to build some synergistic sets. In this way, you are balancing your board strategy (where your dudes are located) against your tableau-building strategy -- which provides an interesting and complimentary balance of options without overwhelming.

I don't expect enormous depth from the game given its stated goals, but there is certainly enough here to keep me interested, even for multiple games in a row. Because the game is so short, and because you can literally see your options running out (the game ends when you fill up all the slots in your tableau), there is tension and a sense of hurry. All in all, it's a game worthy of its name, and certainly one worth playing if you are at all interested in the dudes on a map genre.

Great short game for 3-4 players (the 2 player game doesn't work, and I wish they would have extended it to 5 players). The area control is pretty basic, but set collection and money management make this game interesting. I haven't even used the included variant pieces yet but they seem like they'll help change up the game enough to keep it interesting for quite a few plays.

Update: I still think this is an okay game, but there's just nothing about it that makes me want to play it over any other area majority game. Also, it doesn't really work with two players.

A first step into area control. Modular boards, scales from 2-4, plays in 20 minutes, sets up very quickly. 

Additional mechanics look to add a bit of depth and replayability.

Light, artsy, area control game with fun mechanisms. Seems like a better two-player experience, otherwise the winner tends to be whoever interacts with their opponents the least (since interacting wastes resources/turns).

RATING: 9
Always a blast to play.  Variant options in this game are super fun, and it isn't hard to make up new ones.  The only reason why I didn't give a 10 is because of the expansion set (Lost Lands): The expansion's new (and optional too, thank god!) gameplay mode is horrendous, and the new big board map is mediocre at best, but otherwise an absolutely necessary expansion set, if a bit too expensive for what is does.

Eight Minute Empire Legends is a little different than the original Eight Minute Empire.  There is new art work, modular boards, set collection has been revamped and there are now leaders.  All in all if you don't have either game, Legends is probably the way to go... but the differences don't really add up to that much of a different game.  The artwork made more of an impact in terms of difference than the gameplay did for me.

[thing=142326][/thing] is an area control game mixed with set collection. The game is pretty straightforward: in your turn you take one of the cards of the row of six cards. The first card is free, the next two cost 1, the fourth and fifth cost 2 and the sixth, and last, cost 3. Every card has two parts: the bottom part has the action allowed by the card - it will usually be: put armies (cubes) in the board, move armies, take out armies of your opponents or build a fortress. The upper part has the name of the card and the special effect of it: or it will give you a boost in some of the actions (like one extra movement) or it will have some sort of point-related thing (like +1 VP for every card you have with the [i]Forest[/i] type, or +1 VP for every three coins you have at the end of the game). You gain points by controlling territories and regions, and also by the cards that give VPs. After 8 rounds the game ends - so everyone will have taken 8 cards - and the player with the most points, wins!

First of all: the game does not takes only 8 minutes to end. Maybe 8 minutes per player - it can be less, but the game will usually last 25-30 minutes do end. It still sits comfortably in the filler section. And a filler with some meat in the bones, for sure. Every turn there are choices: which card to take, how to better use the action. They aren't really difficult decisions, but aren't mindless either - you must consider, ponder about your game and the game of others. [thing=142326][/thing] is a tatical game by nature, but your choices could go from start to finish, since some cards are worth points based in your choices of cards latter on.

As an area control game, [thing=142326][/thing] offers a lot of player interaction, not always in the way of hurting the game of others, but mostly by vying for the same regions or territories. Also, the cards that are worth VPs call for attention, since if you leave some cards, the others might make a good amount of direct points (for instance, if the same player takes the 2 [i]Noble[/i] cards, he will gain 4 VPs). So [thing=142326][/thing] isn't really a game of you do your thing, I do mine, in the end we compare things and see who did better. In here you fight! Sort of.

Replay value seems to be high, since the order of the cards affects the whole game, and also the set up of the regions can change. The game comes with variants that surely will help to keep the game fresh for longer. But takes this a grain of salt, since I can't really say for sure in this matter.

The game bits are great: the boards are sturdy, the box is just the right size, the card stock is fine. I would like that the chits for coins to be bigger, but I can live with what it got. The manual is well made and clear - it is easy to find informations on it. The artwork in the cards is excellent - Ryan Laukat is really a talented artist.

Only one thing bothered us: that the last player have it rough and he doesn't have any initial advantage. Sure, the first player is the one that wins the bid. But the second, third and fourth players, technically, all lost, but their position goes from better to worst without difference among them other than one being in the right side of the winner of the bid, and the other in the left side of the player. And being in last is a bad position to be in: in the first round, the others choose before you, and in the last round, the first player will have 6 options (of course, if the money he has allows), the next will have 5, the next 4 and the last player only 3 options. Maybe if the last player got one or two extra coins, things could be more even. "But this isn't suppose to be even, that's why you bid!", you might say. I guess so, in some sense, but I still would like to see blind auctions for the other positions, not only for first player - it would be better, and it won't add more than one minute to the playing time. Anyway, nothing really major, just something we all felt after playing.

To sum it up: [thing=142326][/thing] is a solid game, a great filler, with above average components, easy to learn, easy to play, offering a nice set of decisions to be made in such a small frame of time. I liked it quite a bit and will track a copy for myself.

RATING: 7.5
Kickstarted. DIY version [initially].

As a standalone game I have mixed feelings. I don't think the modular boards are a good idea because (in a 4p) the islands will always be in a ring shape, so your strategic options for initial expansion are basically "go left" or "go right." [Comment obsolete as it seems the suggestion for four boards is to use a T shape.]

The new cards are much more interesting. The set collection aspect of the original has been toned down in that a given set scores nothing unless you obtain the card that activates that set. I'm happy to play with it now (whereas I ignore it in the original game).

Cards also have secondary perks that increase the number of cubes you place or move, resembling technological research that will help you later. "Move by sea" cards are gone, replaced by sea movement simply costing more movement points, with a separate "technology" that reduces sea movement cost. I'm not sold yet on this stuff overall being good or bad. It seems like a good idea because ultimately it still pertains to map play. But if you collect a bunch of placement bonuses you can get a ridiculous placement entitlement and hit your cube limit, and if you collect two "wings" you can move across sea exactly the same as land.

A possible downside of the set collection game, in my opinion, is that it becomes feasible sometimes to buy cards simply for their suit, not caring what action you get, and neglect your board position. If you get all three "Noble" cards (which I've seen someone luck into) you get 5 VP [in P&P version], the same as holding five regions. It happens plenty that a player doesn't even hold five regions at the end of the game, so the "Noble" bonus is a no-brainer if you can get it.

The map has fewer regions than the original game but the cube mix has been increased from 14 to 18 cubes per player. Even so I was starting to hit against the cube limit. This cube abundance doesn't manifest itself as a bunch of heavily contested regions, but more like piles of cubes being stockpiled in one city because the player can't get the movement cards he needs or because he's playing for card suits and doesn't care.

...Played the published version, where the donut world is officially not the way to set it up. The set collection is more compelling in this game vs. the original (which is why I try to play this game using it) but I don't like its effect on the game, de-emphasizing the map play as I've said. I think these additional scoring means (as well as the removal of over-sea movement as a separate action type) also reduce the tension of the card market. There is hardly ever "the thing you absolutely must get" that's worth paying 3 coins for.

I have not tried the optional tokens that can be placed on the board, which seem to be a valiant effort to squeeze more longevity out of this map system.

Quite a feat to pull out such a pleasurable area-control experience in 20 minutes or so ! Plus, the art is just beautiful.

Quick and enjoyable game.  Good mechanics.  Interesting choices.  It feels like it ends a little too soon though.  Last player can have an advantage for the final scoring.  This can be eroded if other players take all of the move cards (not always possible).  So the last player usually has a nice boost or a boring last turn.

Light and polished, but also pretty bland.  It is one of the better Kickstarter offerings I've had a chance to play, but it's not something I want to play often.  If given a choice for this kind of feather-light game, I'd probably go with [gameid=172].  This game doesn't have the real feel of empire building, but more simple area majority.  When and how the cards come out can have a big difference and can contribute a lot to your score.  Still, it's a pretty meaty dish for its playtime.

I'm so confused. I've been wanting to play this game so much but then - when I finally did - I didn't enjoy it. Maybe it was because my company was so sour at the time? I don't know.

Need more plays.

Edit: I gave this game a new change. The experience was a lot more enjoyable with a gamer friend than a non-gamer relative. I really like the components and the overall visual design of this game. I'm not very interested in area control as a mechanic but I appreciated the way the cards are deployed in this game.

Medium weight (3).
Low player interaction.
Low-medium theme application (new cards make a bit more thematic sense, especially wings etc.).

A great follow-up to the first 8ME, Legends addresses the sea travel rarity by making sea travel possible for anyone for a fee of 3 x movements per single army. A steep price, for sure, but many cards now carry benefits or abilities, some of which are wings that reduce sea movement by 1 so two wing cards will have you sorted if you can get them.

Only playing four players is a bit of a change, but the added layers probably justify the reduction.

I love the idea of filler games: short games that fill up the time between longer games or while waiting for others to show up. However, I'm typically ambivalent towards them, they do nothing for me. This game is something of an exception. 

It's a pretty simple area control game: you have cubes and there is a map made of islands and within those island regions. At the end of eight rounds you get one point for each region you control (have more cubes in than anyone else) and one point for each island you control. On top of that there are ways to get points from the cards you take. 

What cards you ask? The cards are your turns action and dictate what you can do, whether that's moving cubes, adding cubes, destroying cubes, or building cities. In addition, those cards [i]can[/i] provide permanent bonuses that you receive each and every turn. The problem with the cards is that depending on where they are in the row of cards (six I think) they're either free or they cost 3 money and there are very few ways to get more money than what you start with.

All of these interesting decisions, twists, and turns all take place in the span of about 20 minutes and for me that fixes one of the biggest issues of filler games: it's still interesting while being short. I'm happy to own it and would likely snatch up any expansions.

Definitely better than its older brother Eight Minute Empire. There's more meat to this version and the set collection aspect is done better. The leader cards also add a little variety and the artwork and components are better than the original. The retail price for this game is ridiculously high though. I bought a used copy for around €16, which I would say is fair. Replaces EME for me.

Fantasy mythos civilization builder with area control on modular two-sided island maps. Select a leader card for a unique ability.

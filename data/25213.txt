Not a big fan but this is probably more to do with it being a Dutch game and I'm not Dutch so I may know one or two items on each card.  Prefer to skip it.

This has become somewhat of a hype but in every circumstance I can think of a better game to play than this one. It's yet another 'describe X without mentioning Y' type of game, with teams.

Fun game to play with any group of people, no matter their gaming background. I prefer to play it in teams of 3 if the number of players is large enough.

Mainstream classic, and pretty much exclusively a party game. It's no fun if you take it too seriously.

Perfect game for large groups. It's a pity that all cards are in Dutch. Since I'm often in international company, this game is out of reach.

Good for family get togethers and the like. Zero rules, fine party game. A downside is you go through the cards pretty quickly.

LOL with almost every crowd. The best moment I recall was when my mother in law described the famous Dutch speed skater Erben Wennemars with the single word description "bicylist" and my wife subsequently guessed correctly on her first attempt.

Ok to play with the right group, but the die that is included adds a very random element to the game that a highly dislike. It doesn't add anything.
Bad game design in my eyes.

Really had fun playing this party game. The fact that you need do describe/guess 5 different things/persons in 30 seconds makes this a real challenge. The use of the die is a novelty in my book: throwing high (2) will result in more tension to describe/guess the things/persons right.

I would only play this with people who go in with the fun (crazy sounds, crazy descriptions, etc.), otherwise this wouldn't be fun. You also get to know the other person(s) better, especially if you're teaming up with persons you don't talk to very often.

Party game, guessing game. An activity rather than a game. Can be some fun with the right group in the right situation.

Leuk spel vooral door de tijdsdruk en hoe iedereen dan moeilijker gaat nadenken over de begrippen. Maar ik ben er zelf niet zo goed in, ik neem niet echt de moeite namen van acteurs ed te onthouden, en die komen er best veel in voor.  Maar het is nog altijd een leuk spel om te spelen.

Irish simplistic version of Taboo/Time's up. Filled with traditional Irish words such as Bulmers, Trinity College and the first Irish president. Naturally, I was kinda bad at it :P OK game for pubs and drinking, better if you're Irish

I have spent countless hours playing this game.  I will find it difficult to recall a gathering while at varsity where the game did not make an appearance at some point over the course of the evening.  Simple concept that didn't necessarily depend on one's level of general knowledge (although a definite advantage). Every game changes with different players or even with only shuffling the teams. Most memorable moments actually involve people getting things horribly wrong but still guessing the correct answer. I've rarely played the game with the dice.

Party game, somewhat similar to Apples to Apples. One team member tries to describe 5 subjects (people, things, places) in 30 seconds, and the other team members have to guess.

A bit more repetitive than A2A because all rounds are the same.

I am not so into party games. But once in a while, with the right people I am willing to make the sacrifice. I just don't like the endless discussions about the rules of what you can and cannot say or do.

A fun game, one of the best party games imo. Luckily there is an expansion available, cause you will need it after a while, cause you quickly strat to rember the answers.

Enjoyable party game, but not the best one out there. As with most trivia based games, there is a large skill disparity between players. For instance, I don't have a TV, so I don't know many of the people I have to describe. Still, probably good for a few laughs.

Won with the 999 games contest.
Traded it for Ingenious.

RATING: 8
Plain hilareous party game. I tend to dislike pure trivia games like Trivial Pursuit, as the same players will always win. Not so with 30 Seconds, where you not only need to know the subjects you have to describe, you also have to describe them in such a way that your team mate(s) can guess them. It's always an amazing feat when a team manages to finish all five subjects within 30 seconds. As these games go, however, the number of cards is limited, limiting the replay value of the game. But still it's much higher that for more traditional trivia games. The components are somewhat basic, but I can recommend this to anyone looking for a nice party game.

A very popular game in South Africa, apparently designed by a South African (Calie Esterhyse).
It's most definitely a party game, but a pretty entertaining one.

I've played this game a few time at friends. I'm not up-to-date on pop culture, which makes some of the cards hard to do and my girlfriend who is not from Europe has even more problems with it.

Even with this in mind, I usually enjoy my time with it and like the frantic screaming that occurs when someone is not able to find the right words to describe something.

Played thrice. Best with 2 teams of 2. Can be massively frustrating, but not always in a bad way. Two points of annoyance: the very luck-dependent die and quite a lot of words (mostly people and brands) that you probably don't know or just can't describe.

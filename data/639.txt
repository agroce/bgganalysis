Educational and fun. Luck can overwhelm any strategy in this game, so it is best enjoyed as an experience. Some solid strategy remains, however, and I believe a more innovative player will win more frequently.

Great game, on the most epic scale of any game I own.

A fascinating and rich experience. The main issue is randomness (obviously a huge part of evolution anyway) - the card draws and climate changes are unpredictable and impossible to plan for. If you want hard strategy you should probably look elsewhere, but for no-holds barred super theme, this is the right game for you.

Just came along this good old friend in the database. I really like the theme of the game. Both the rule book and the game mechanics are impressively ... accurate. And ... smart. And ... historically correct. 

You know, like Pete in high school who always got perfect grades and always made his homework and who everybody liked because, well, he was a nice guy and there really was nothing wrong with him. But remember? Pete always wore those ugly shirts, and his shoes were really ... cheap. And sometimes stuff he said just sounded ... strange. And in the end, nobody really liked him, because, well, there really was nothing special about him. 

No, really. American Megafauna is great and smart and interesting, but call me cheap, I still think it might have profited a lot from better components to cover up for the loooong rule book. All these paper cards flying around ... just so annoying...

I wonder what Pete is doing now?

A wonderful simulationist game. There's a few choices to be made but mostly it's all about seeing what crazy stuff happens this time. I don't understand the point of playing with a score; whoever has the most critters at the end wins because they're most viable.

RATING: N/A
Pretty much the ultimate progression of the evolution themed games. Lots of detail to the point that this one is almost a simulation, at least as far as that is possible with this type of subject matter. The game itself could probably serve as a textbook in graduate level courses on this topic.

Initial rating after 1 learning game.  Interesting topic and fairly simple game play.  Just unsure I like this enough to play it again.  Gene cards seems to be overwhelming in power if you end up with enough of them.  I was not sure when to switch between predator and prey.

Don't buy this game for high quality components.

Instead buy it for a great look at science and natural history.  The game can swing quite rapidly if you get out-evolved by competitors.  Went from the top of the food chain as a herbivore to the bottom of the chain as a carnivore.  Definitely want to get more time with this game.  It's a great simulation.  This would be great for high school science students.

This is more a simulation than a game. Very original, the game provides the players with a lot of info on the subject, much better than a dry book. The downside is that it's very random. High replaybility but limited strategic options. Nature force rampages on everybody.

This game is right up my alley. I love the story being told as the eons tick by, I love watching what happens, I love the personality of my evolving animals. I love the mental image of tool-using carnosaurs being preyed on by doves. The only reason it isn't rated higher is because I don't want to play again until I've improved the components some.

Great game!
At first it seemed a lot like a simulation board game without much player influence and a lot of luck. After a couple of plays I'm impressed by how confrontational the game can be.
Despite the simple rules there are a lot of options you could do to adapt to the ever changing world.
The rules are simple and understandable but bad organized. A couple of solitary plays with the rulebook close at hand help a lot.
Love the theme!

RATING: 8.5
What a theme - looks like a wonderful game.  The rules read very well and I am looking forward to playing immensely!

Update: Played 2 solitaire games.  I will update my comments here as I play more.  In the first game all my species went extinct prior to the beginning of the Cenozoic - it was still fun. In the second game I fared much better.  There were quite a few turns of just allowing things to 'hum' along - I'll need to check the rules again to make sure I was doing everything correctly.

A really good and story filled game.  I love the theme.  The game could be quite chaotic, and there are mechanical imbalances inbuilt to service a more thematic experience - the massive bonus derived from sex DNA is one example.  This could be a deal breaker for anyone looking for a real mechanical puzzle.  However, for those looking for an interesting game dealing with a fascinating theme, this is as thematic and enjoyable and any game of Twilight Imperium or Runebound - and all in all probably as balanced.  So if you like sweeping epic games that tell epic tales - this will be a hit!

I think the game will improve significantly with more players, the solitaire game is neat for learning and telling some of the story - I really think it will become more interesting with more players.  Time will tell, and I will update with more thoughts each time I play.

Update:  Played with 2.  A great game - much improved as a multiplayer, though solo is still fun.  Multiplayer adds in the relevance of the map and all the various things that go with it: biome displacement due to greenhouse increases/decreases etc.  It is a really good game where the story that rises from the experience is well worth the effort.

The living rules are the best laid out and complete set - make sure you get hold of those.  There are some rules questions that pop up, but most of the time the answers are easily found and the answers are logical.  I have a great time playing this game.

Update: made my own little Gondwana board for solo play.  Great game with a great narrative!

RATING: 8
AMF is an interesting artifact, but Bios: Megafauna does everything AMF does in a far more compact, playable, intense package. Really no reason to play AMF anymore now that Bios exists.
---
Having played this a few times, I very highly recommend the following house rule: instead of the two fixed scoring events, score immediately before any catastrophe is resolved. This works great, gives the game more scoring nuance, and incidentally manages to time the scoring perfectly, just before a few major, game-altering events. My rating for the game is with this house rule. Without it, it would be substantially lower, as the scoring as published simply doesn't work very well.

Also, I think this game is significantly the best with 4 players. I own the expansion, and the new creature type is neat, but I haven't been tempted at all to throw in the new cards, or to play with 5, although it might be neat to try once sometime.

I am rather fond of American Megafauna, and with the scoring variant above, I think it works great and doesn't require the extensive fiddling many have tried to do with it. It's highly chaotic, sure, but it's not insane and good play is definitely rewarded. It's evocative and fun and every game really is different.

I just wish it played a little bit quicker. The scope is right, the amount of action is right, it's just that there are a few bits of tactical minutia that can trip you up, and enough things you want to be careful of, that it seems you end up having to carefully double-check that no, nothing is happening on this card flip, we can go ahead to the next turn just often enough to trip up the pace of the game. I've played the full game a few times and it seems to clock in at 5-5.5 hours, which is not bad given how much is in there, but man, it would be awesome if you could get the same amount of action into 4 or 4.5, and it seems like it should be possible.

Anyway, a great and fun game which I'm happy to put next to games of a similar weight class and length like Britannia or Roads and Boats. Not a classic, but good and fun game.

RATING: 7
A stunning simulation of evolution, and by simulation I mean *simulation*. This is no mere abstract with thematic pasting such as Primordial Soup. However, as much as I enjoyed the rigor of the simulation, I have to say this feels more like a "cooperative experience" than a game. I made a few interesting choices, but for the most part I simply sat back and enjoyed watching the show unfold. This isn't the kind of game play that I normally seek out but I did enjoy it and hope to play again.

I'm not sure how to rate American Megafauna on the same scale as Princes of Florence. My first game was played with a bunch of house rules heavily inspired by Stephen O'Sullivan's variant, and I didn't really think the game worked. Since then I've insisted on playing straight by the book. Much, much better. The best experience game I've ever played.

Easy solution for unacceptable game length: play faster and play often. With a little practice you can get this down to an evening-length title.

Reminds me of Arkham Horror in some mechanical ways.  I feel smarter after playing.  This game needs three or more players.  One or two is boring.

This precursor to Bios: Megafauna is better in some ways and worse in other ways. I like that this version has more flexibility when it comes to mutating your species. You could end up with some very weird combinations of traits! Unfortunately, moving your species around from biome to biome is the least interesting part, and the game often ends up playing you rather than the other way around.

A game of evolution and environmetal changes - but not the usual abstract or funny crap. It's amazing that a very complex subject could be transformed in a fairly easy, yet realistic game. Artwork is good. Last but not least: what's more fun than pimping your small dino into a T-rex?

-
Gameparts are flimsy at best. Eurogamers will be in for a nasty suprise... Also, gameplay is different. Don't play to win as it's very luckbased - but hey, that's evolution. Try to give your creatures some good adaptations and hope the monster-meteor will not kill 'm all off.

I'm a scientist by training with an interest and some knowledge of the subject matter.  Scientifically this is a really neat game, and I quite enjoyed playing it once it was explained to me.  It is fun to create different types of critters and watch them fail or succeed based on the genetic enhancements you give them.  For the general gaming public however it is unlikely to satisfy unfortunately.  The rules that come with the game are close to incomprehensible; the basic information that you need is scattered throughout the enormous rules list and my group never did fully figure it out on our own.   Plus, it took about two hours to cut out all the pieces (something that only the hardcore will take the time to do).  Playing through the entire game is likely to take most of a day; we only played through the end-Cretaceous and it took about 3 hours (although some of it was admittedly teaching time).  I would like to play this again, but really only with folks who already know how, because it would be a monumental effort to teach it to others and sadly I haven't found anyone willing to take the time.  I would rate this game higher if the rules were more easily understood and the game were shorter so that it had a more general appeal.  Scientifically though it is excellent and might best be used as a fun teaching tool.

Yes, AMF occasionally feels like a simulation as much as a game.  The decision-making is not all that complex and the draw of cards can have a huge impact on the outcome.  It's not a good game to play for money.

But it is amazing how well it holds together, with as many moving layers it has.  As you fight for survival, the Earth shifts around and under you, but it never feels unfair or clunky.  This game is a design marvel, and well worth the investment into cutting the game pieces and learning the rules if you have any interest in the theme.

Rating is a '10' for simulation, but '5' for actual game play. The sheer randomness of genotypes, migrant species, biomes, traits, and catastrophes coming into play can really take away from the fun factor of the game. Will have to look for a variant that ensures that more than 20% of the biomes in play will actually be useable at some point during a game. I think this is the only flaw of the simulation that the game mechanics can't handle. 

Lots of detail and very well researched.  Definitely worth trying out if you're a natural history/evolution/dinosaur buff.  Really brings to light that evolution is more "Survival of the Lucky" than "Survival of the Fittest".

Chaotic, certainly but very nice, scales well, and not too long. One of these games that tells a story and I just love that. You can tell what happened in a game to someone that doesn't know the rules and doesn't even play games and it's still funny and interesting. Still it has two real flaws in my opinion: it is a bit fiddly, and your influence on how the game turns out, and how you do in it, is a bit too limited maybe. Still a great experience and a fun game.

I lent my copy to Johnnydollar to learn and bring back. He brought it over tonight and it was more fun then I thought it would be.

I had read about half the rules early last year and from various comments from time to time, I thought it would be overly complicated and dry.

But, we all had a blast. Unfortunately, I went extinct the during the last two cards before the first scoring. I comet came and hit and wiped me out. I only had one species (or whatever the called it) and it had A LOT of diversity. Best of all, in places other people didn't have. So, I had 12 of my 14 out and if the comet hadn't hit, I think the person in 2nd only had about 7. But, once I went so did two other players. So, 3 of the 4 players went out the round right before scoring.

It would be fun to try again, although it took us around three hours.

An extremely bad boardgame.  Why?

1) The rules are very complex and poorly organized.  Many important rules are hidden away in the glossary.  The rules governing the actual gameplay and player choices are stashed away at the end of 10 pages of confusing text about how the gameboard moves around.  

2) The game play is boring.  The majority of the play time is spent deterministically updating the geography of the board.  Actual choices are few and far between.

3) The game play is completely broken.  In our game, only one new genotype and one new gene came up.  The player who purchased the new genotype could out compete both the herbivores and predators.  A couple of turns later, all the other players were driven to extinction.  While possibly realistic, this makes for a very un-enjoyable game.

As a computer simulation, this game might have been alright.  As a boardgame it is a complete failure and a waste of the player's time.

Definitely its own beast.
Pretty much the antithesis of eurogame standards (it has player elimination, an epic game length anywhere from 3 to 8 hours, etc).  As much thematic chrome as any Ameritrash/FFG game, yet plays almost more like a war game.  But the flavor is pure biological (evolutionary, ecological, paleohistorical).
Components are barely above a print-and-play.  

More a simulation than a game.  I'm not sure how I feel about the somewhat obvious choices; yet, the game has awesome replayability and variety, and tells a memorable, epic (and funny!) story.  The science is incredibly well researched and it has great educational value, and a nice sense of humor, the game is not at all dry.

The rule book is the worst I've ever read, even the living rules were a bit of a challenge; with this much theme and complexity of interactions any ruleset will be hefty, but, I feel the game designer would benefit by hiring a proven rules author for the next edition.

I have bought this game because I'm a biologist and I was intrigued by the evolutionary theme and the very good comments about it at the BGG.

RATING: 9
Great game, but very much luck dependent.
The cards used in a specific game may lead to very different games. Sometimes relatively uneventful, sometimes a chaotic mess. The best games are closer to the second than to the first. Having a varied deck of cards for a game gives the best chances for a varied (chaotic) game. Therefore, it may be better to select (at least part of the) cards (before shuffling!) than randomly drawing them.
Besides that, scoring on a very limited number of fixed points in the game makes winning more dependent on a few events than on success throughout the game. If you're the 'top dog' all of the game except when there's a scoring round because of a - very unpredictable - 'bad' event, you'll lose. This is easily fixed by counting (and adding) a score at the end of every round.

I would gladly play this again anytime. The rules make it harder than it actually is as Phil Eklund tends to favor leaving things up to the inference of the players. We aren't as smart as you Phil you have to explain it to us!

This was a great adventure though. Watching the continent change and hoping to make the correct changes with your creatures along with it makes for a great story throughout the game.

A game based on the competition between mammals and dinosaurs to be the fittest in ever-changing Earth. Each turn is roughly 6 million years. It is interesting as a concept but lacks gaming tension, as the players cannot do much to avoid extinction: it is too random.

Like all Sierra Madre games the pace can vary drastically from play to play; but it is engaging and pretty simple compared to other Sierra Madre games.   I avoided this game for a long time because the cover art made me think of some monster-battle game. Instead it's hard science!  Much better in my view.

But why put essential rules in the glossary?

Now have played three solo games, a two-player game, three three player, and a four-player.  Each playing I've liked the game better.  Has been described as Ursuppe on steroids.  Rule book a little intimidating, but the solo game really helps.  This is a very, very good game.  Have never learned more from a game, I don't think.  The amount of detail is incredible, and the number of cards make every game totally different.  Played well with each number of players, although have not tried the 5th player expansion yet.  This one improves on a full '9' from me.  The only minor negative for me is the scoring, but actually, I don't care who wins.  This is a no-dice game, well-designed, documented, and deserves more exposure.

I spent 4-5 hours between reading/teaching the rules; then due to a fluke the first game ended within a couple turns.

Nice components, although the animals could be more exotic. A lot of the game depends on the initial shuffle of the deck. Any particular play could be exceeding uneventful if all you get are immigrants or your populations get boxed in. A house rule of mine limits the number of immigrants per era, just make things a bit more interesting. The rules could be a little clearer in parts.

I've never actually played this game but rate it highly for the wealth of fascinating scientific information in the rulebook. I really like the look of the game too: put a piece of plexiglass over the game board and you've got a sharp looking setup.

Unpunched. Concerning production values: this game would really be a nice print and play; the quality would be better had I printed it out myself. I think I could have done it cheaper as well. The box comes in the envelope, folded flat, and is about the thickness of the cardstock used for playing cards. You'd have to actually cut it apart and glue it onto some real cardboard for it to function as a box.

Also- it was horribly damaged when shipped, because it shipped in a flimsy envelope - not even a cardboard envelope, it was one of those flimsy plastic-y usps envelopes... about half the components were damaged in shipping.

That said, this is still a one of a kind game, and it's not available as a print and play. I'm very interested in the subject, so I am the target audience niche for this game. I can actually look past the production values, but the horrible choice of shipping medium irks me.

I like games that deal with evolution and prehistory. I like games that have a lot of chrome. I like games that serve their theme and are not just a clever gaming mechanism. In all of the above American Magafauna scores high. Sure, I would prefer a better quality of the components but this would not be very realistic expectation for a game that obviously severs a tiny niche of the gaming world. 
The rules are not too well written but are not very complex so they can be mastered with a some effort. 
Playability: the game is quite playable and very enjoyable. It's not just a simulation, it's a game.

RATING: 5
rules are unclear at times, very cheap components (some of which have to be cut apart with scissors, in fact it¬¥s not more then some paper and cheap, thin cardboard) for this price.
Lots of time (and this as a loooong game) where next to nothing is happening.
Apart from that, very good and interesting game about evolutionary processes, though clearly not for everybody. Should be seen more as a simulation than a game, because competition between players is sometimes very unfair (where evolutionary leaps are made), and players can go extinct altogether half the way through.

RATING: 9
Excellent game I find myself wanting to play far more often than actually gets the chance.  Burdened by a perception of length (it goes quickly with experienced players), and the fact that evolutionary and geologic forces can turn out to be just plain beyond the players' control.  I still have a great time whenever I play.

RATING: 5
Richly-themed biological/geological evolution game with too few strategic options.  I loved all the evocative details, and the algorithmic mechanics driving how the board may change each turn created some interesting shifts.  The gameplay offers mild complexity (there's an auction every other turn or so and some choice in how/where to grow your populations), but decisions players get to make are usually obvious, shallow, and easily overturned by random events.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The version 1.0 ruleset is a little slow. But combine the 2.0 & 3.0 versions and it flows a lot better.  There is just something magical about a game that portrays the evolution of dinosaurs (and some lame rodents or something).  It is a little dry and could use a makeover in the bits department, but a lot of fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Great theme, but the gameplay is a bit confusing, mostly due to the poorly organized rulebook (many of the rules are actually found in the glossery, so you're constantly flipping back and forth). This is especially annoying during the game, as I find I have to frequently refer to the rulebook. The components are functional, but flimsy.  This is would be a tough sell to more casual gamers.

played the intro 2 player game.  This wasn't very good but I'm holding my rating because i can see that this game has a lot potential once you get the whole game down. The intro game is really a waste of time unless your introducing young kids. Played the game twice solo as if there were two players.  Very confusing rules.  might be the worst I've ever seen.  spend hours in the rule book trying the figure out terms or rules.  that's just not fun,  pretty much got the hang of it but it breaks my heart to say that this game continues to be disappointing to me since I was a geology major.  a lot of the game is more like watching the the game rather than playing.  The game can really get bogged down when biome don't come up.  Went through 15 rounds without a biome card so no gene income and thus meant rounds which neither player had any genes left.  I want to continue to explore this game because the theme interests me so hopefully the rating will improve.

Some really interesting mechanics here.  But the graphic design is abyssmal.  It was much too difficult telling things apart.  Some color coding would have gone a long way to fixing this.

Essen 2007 purchase. Played once for two of the four eras, to get a feel for the game. Seems funny, but deck preparation might become a necessity...

UPDATE: Played an additional three times, and although the idea is nice, there's not enough game in it for me. There's a significant chance people aren't participating for several turns...

UPDATE: This game might have become obsolete with the arrival of Dominant Species. True, AM might be the Ameritrash original with DS the Euro adaptation.

I rate it as usually willing to play, but that's just cause it IS kind of interesting. Unfortunately, its slow upkeep make this long as !&%$ so other players are difficult to find.

Went and read through some of the threads here - Sounds like I should try it with some revised living rules and perhaps a shorter variant.
I always did like the bidding for unique powers, the competition for resources, and the bizarre stories you could tell at the end about your flying, camoflaged, vampiric whales - But the only two times I ever actually got to the end of the game with anyone else still along for the ride were at overnight boardgame parties with some pretty tenacious players.

As an AT fan, I *loved* the original AM. It's no more fiddly than most AT games, and the sheer variety of events meant that you were playing a parallel earth that had a completely different history than ours.

More of a simulation than a game. The rules are much harder to read than the game is to play. Lots of concepts and terms to get used to. Best method is to try playing through a round slowly. This game is harder to get into than its stablemate, Origins, because of terminology and the unusual mechanics. However one of our favourites.

I don't know why this game's fun, but it is. It's long and complicated and random events can really mess up your strategy and it's more a simulation than a game.

But we still really like it. It must be the genetics geekery and the fact that you could evolve flying carnivorous elephants with sonar.

This game is totally retarded.

Out of the box it sucks.  I wouldn't give it more that a four.  That said, there is so much cool stuff going on here that you can't help but want the game to be so much more.

Honestly the problem is that this is a wonderful simulation.  It is like watching a clockwork village in a snow globe. It runs well on its own, but frankly there isn't much game to work with.

We spent a while trying to fix it up only to realize that Steffan O'Sullivan had done most of the work that we were thinking about putting into place.  I recommend his fixes.  

That said, I still don't think it is close enough to being a working game rather than an experience where you are just along for the ride.  There are just not enough dynamics and it is easy to reach a homeostasis where one player will be niched into a corner with little or no worthwhile moves to make.

First of all, I think that this should only be played with three players.

I highly recommend in addition to S.S. variants, pulling a biome time every turn (so flipping tiles on the off cycle 'til you get one), maintaining the balance of 4 in every hex (so when one goes down the other increases), and most importantly, scoring before ever cataclysm. 

The game is really entertaining, it just needs to be finished.

This is a very good game. If you are interested in the theme... If you are, I'd recommend starting out with BIOS: Megafauna, play it a couple of times - and then move on to this. There will still be things you do not quite understand but it is not too bad, really. Read the living rules though. Then sit back and let yourself be taken for a ride. It is magnificent. Might be better as a solitaire.

NB: Only played solo - I'm sure this would be scored higher if I'd played 2 player or more but it's just too complex for my partner to be interested.

When I first read the description for this game, the first thing that popped into my head were memories of playing SimEarth year ago. So, of course, I had to have it!

I picked it up in Fall 2004, and it got quite a bit of play. Some of the rules aren't all that intuitive, but if you poke around a bit on the 'net you can find some session reports and info (some of it for the previous edition) that helps to fill in the gaps.

With two players, we can usually get through a game of this in an hour and a half. The 'busy' part of the game is the Triassic and early Jurassic, or after some major event disturbs the map. Otherwise you reach a balancing point where you end up sailing through several turns, until someone gets a gene or genotype that changes the balance of power.

I really recommend this game if you like the theme, or if you remember SimEarth fondly.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I adore this in all of its ugly, messy, overdesigned and underdeveloped glory.  Dinosaurs and the transition to mammals and eventually hominids are not covered by many other games, and none come even close to this level of fidelity to theme.  This, and its prettier-but-less-charming younger sibling [gameid=97915] are the premier titles for covering this swatch of history.

The good stuff about this game is that it is likely to teach you something.  Even if you go to your local natural history museum every few months, you're going to learn something from the deep dive here.  The DNA developments are ridiculously specific, such as how a different tail will affect eating habits, or what new kinds of habitat are opened up with a different gastrointestinal tract.

Phil Eklund has carved out a niche for his designs by making the academic theory the raison d'etre for his games.  Gameplay and strategy are nice to have if they can be added, but they take a backseat to hewing to the research.  AMF is no exception.  The winner is almost certainly going to be lucky, and the loser is almost certainly going to get screwed many times by catastrophe or DNA availability.  This, along with the game's spartan graphic design and admittedly bad components are going to turn some gamers off, but it will have a wonderful appeal to others.  For those like me who see the appeal, there's no substitute.

Wow.  Certainly more of a simulation than game, but the game is also enjoyable, with so many subsystems interacting and creating all kinds of subtle and interesting decisions.

The scientific fortitude in American Megafauna is amazing.  Evolutionary biologists with a sense of humor (feathered hippos? awesome!) would love it.

As a game, however, AM just doesn't cut it.  Biomes have overly-specific requirements, for instance, and DNA enhancements - which are critical to survival - are relatively scarce.

Moreover, not only is the game overwhelmingly detailed, but all information in AM is completely open, which means that players either (a) give up in their analysis efforts, make a mess of things, and gleefully await the unexpected consequences (which is the correct response), or (b) spend entirely too much time processing the current and future gamestates and bog down the game for everyone else.

I have no problem giving Megafauna a 9 as a curiously attractive and thought-provoking simulation.  In terms of an enjoyable game, however, AM gets the rating that it deserves.

Really hard rules to digest owing to the weight of technical jargon, and the number of possible interactions of all the game rules. But once you get it on the table, it makes sense - which helps enormously, but still doesn't make it EASY...

But the reward is amazing - if you are fascinated by evolution, dinosaurs, or just games with a huge mass of parts all interacting, try this!

(Trade Interest: low) it's a pretty good game, with some annoying points that can be fixed with some house rules.  pure random stack of cards to begin with is bunk.  genes, and perhaps genotypes should be mixed in to the various piles.  great theme and execution.  playing with scoring before each catastrophe is a great way to make this fun and more balanced.  it seems very harsh to lose your dna with the genetic drift... they come up very often, so it becomes mandatory never to bid on a dna if you can't immediately place it.

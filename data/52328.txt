RATING: 8
Miniature skirmish game in a weird victorian steampunk horror-setting. I bought the rules book, two starter boxes with miniatures and some terraclips terrain. Two plays so far, both of which took 4+ hours. The first match ended up being more of a learning experience than an enjoyable match (both players were new to Malifaux and miniature gaming in general). The next match was fun and engaging, but still moved along way too slow. If I find someone to play this with regularly, I'm guessing playtime is likely to drop to 1-1.5 hours. In that case, my rating is likely to be bumped up to a 9 or possibly even 10.

RATING: 9.5
One of the best miniature games I've played in a very long time.  If you like skirmish games that involve critical thinking and strategy this game is for you.  Each faction plays extremely differently, yet they are pretty well balanced.  It is very important to note that this game, and it's balance, really start to shine when you play the Strategies and Schemes in the rulebook.

The most innovative miniature skirmish game ever made, completely ruined in the newest revamp of the rules!  This rating is based entirely on the original set of rules before all the flavor was sucked out of it.  Combat using cards instead of dice, bluffing, crazy power combos.  This game had it all.

RATING: 10
I actually really enjoy this game, I have no idea why it has such low scores.  It's WAY cheaper than any other miniatures game (I'm looking at you, Warhammer!), has a much shorter playtime, and has the very unique mechanic of using a deck instead of dice and allowing you to "cheat fate."  I definitely recommend this as my favorite miniatures game.

RATING: 5
The Cult of December figures seem to require someone more familiar with the system and making things work together than I am. It feels like it was a bad choice for a first army. The good news is that the Order of the Chimera is more straight forward, but is also versitile.

The Ice Golem is practically useless and a waste of 9 points.

I've mostly been playing Lilith of the Neverborn faction with her Nephilim. They are hand-to-hand monsters. I need to try playing Rasputina again.

RATING: 5
Fun game and setting made by artists. Unfortunately the business side of Wyrd games is very disorganized which has begun to affect their quality control and release schedule/game support. Its been over a year and still haven't played "M2E" due to missing pieces(cards,rulebook..etc)

I want to say they need to hire an executive to actually lead but then how much of their creativity will be lost?

I'm optimistic for the future when they get their act together, but right now my collection gathers dust while I wait...for pieces.

One day, when I have painted my Crews, I will play this game :P Until then, the models are fantastic, high quality and very detailed.  They're really satisfying to paint up as well.  Also props to Wyrd for offering the base inserts, they are reasonably priced and add a lot of character to a miniature (especially for someone clumsy and unable to fashion their own fancy bases).

OOOOOOZES Theme. Such a great theme, and world. Characters are deep, and varied. Loooove this RPG. Would be a 10 except for cost!!! still cheaper than Warhammer 40K but after 3-4 starter sets and book will run 150-200.

Malifaux is a refreshing approach to tactical miniature gaming. The card mechanics combined with the excellent theme and high quality figures make for an addicting game of Victorian steam-punk gothic-horror cthulhu zombie fun!

Interesting game plagued with a horrible Rulebook and tons of errata (mostly fixed in new Rules Manual).  Make it through that and you are rewarded with beautiful miniatures and an innovative game.

RATING: 7
Skirmish miniatures game with loads and loads of options that each character can do. The diceless card based system works great and is a breath of fresh air from the traditional "rolling buckets of dice". The miniatures are extremely well detailed and look great.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Malifaux does a lot of things right. I don't think the storyline is that interesting, but the characters are. Especially the less-clichéd and more fleshed out ones.

But the rules are brilliant. It's almost like a deck-building game (thinking of the way you compose your crew) combined with a strategy game. It's different enough to be a game of its own kind, altogether.

If you are looking for a good skirmish game, this might actually be one of the best you can find.

The main gripe I have with it is that games take a lot of time to play and that some characters are severely overpowered compared to others. The points scale (the soulstone values) don't really reflect the real value of characters.

The fate card mechanic alone blows warhammer and warmachine / hordes out of the water, but the fluff is quirky and exciting, with a dash of truly twisted (Seamus treats his belles a little too tenderly...).  Wholehearted proponent here.

RATING: 7
The card mechanic is very cool and the uniqueness of the units makes you care about each one. Now they just need to have a static boardgame board like Borg's stuff and terrain tiles, then no more measuring! 

I also like that you only have a handful of units. I guess they call this a skirmish wargame; so i guess i like skirmish wargames.

Yet another table top mini's game that b/f jumped head first into and convinced/bribed/connived/persuaded me to play with him... just one demo game... in case I actually liked this one.

And actually I do like this one.

There are no dice only a deck of cards, you can 'cheat' certain draws and add cards from your hand, positioning is more forgiving in this and just about anything is able to take out anything if it draws well enough rather than the issue I kept finding with other tabletop games *cough 40k cough* that certain units cannot physically hurt other units.

Enjoyed this and I am looking forward to being persuaded to play again... heck I might even suggest a game. :)

Sold in 2017.

RATING: 10
Malifaux is an interesting skirmish based miniature wargame with a few unique elements. Most innovative is that the dice are replaced with a deck of cards. All skillchecks are resolved with a cardflip thats added to a base character skill value. In many situations it is possible to "cheat" the cardflip by replacing the card with one from your hand. The handsize is limited to six cards/round though, which forces the player to make difficult decisions when to cheat. Another great feature of the game is the fact that scenarios, in the form of randomised strategies and schemes, takes a major part in the gameplay. It is very rarely of great importance to kill off the enemy entirely, but combat is still often neccesary to complete different objectives in order to win the game. 

Malifaux is a game I´ve been enjoying alot lately and I can´t recommend it enough.

The scenario generator is amazing, as are the varied victory conditions. No wasted turns is also a plus--by turn two you're in each others' faces. I also like the card system, but it is very very difficult to use your crew's boatload of special skills effectively--making the game a bit frustrating.

I now have rules, very nice softback book, quite "privateer Press" in style, which is no bad thing, full colour throughout, featuring both artwork and photos of painted models. Rules are only a few (20 ish) pages, rest is fluff and Lists for the 5 factions (Guuild, Arcanists, Resurectionists, Neverborn and Outcasts). 
The game uses stat cards and playing cards (a diceless system!). Normal cards (plus 2 jokers) can be used, but Wyrd make some very nice sets of cards.
We currently have 1 box set, Marcus' box. The models are a fairly big 28mm, nice and chunky but with sufficient detail to paint easily (my daughter bought the box as her first painting project and she is enjoying it).
I think I will end up getting Outcasts, specifically Gremlins.

RATING: 7
An interesting combination of western/steampunk/magic themes, rolled together with interesting rules to create a decent miniatures game. The Fate Deck mechanic is a great alternative to a dice based system, allowing a surprising amount of strategy. The original line of metal miniatures could be a little hit and miss but the newer plastic sculpts are much more acceptable.

RATING: 6
Enjoyable small-scale miniature tabletop wargame. High rules complexity, highly dependent on chance for outcome of actions. Very distinct factions with exquisite sculpts. Recommended for anyone into miniature wargaming that wants a gamer's game and doesn't want to be forced to spend a lot of money.

Works surprisingly well. The pros of these type of miniature games are that not much miniatures are needed, you can hop in with quite small an invest. The con is always that there's quite a much to remember of each miniature, since they all have some kind of special abilities / spells. Of course this will be easier when you get experienced with system.

Miniatures look quite nice and the gameplay is ok, I'd recommend to try this!

RATING: 5
If this is the most elegant miniatures game, perhaps I am not a miniatures gamer.  I felt very ambivalent after trying this.  On the one hand, I enjoyed the figures, I liked the feeling of diorama and space, and it was easy to feel "present" with the action.  On the other hand, the abilities card was extremely confusing, the abbreviations on it were quite counter-intuitive and the rulebook was gigantic and had no index.  At very least I am going to wait for 2nd edition rules before trying it again.  

Although I liked the figures we were using, some of the other sets seemed excessively gruesome-goth for my tastes.

I am also deeply ambivalent about the tape-measures.  Perhaps I am not meant to be a miniatures gamer, as much as I enjoy toys.

A quirky skirmish game (~ 5-12 models) that differs slightly from other tabletop games in that it uses a deck of 52 playing cards to generate numbers and features shared/individual missions/objectives that reward VPs ie. it's not simply about annihilating the enemy.

I think I finally found a miniatures game for me.  Minimal amounts of measuring is a big plus.  There's a lot of rules, but the basics are really cool.  I love the management of soulstones and cards in your hand as this adds a cool resource-management aspect to the game.  I also like the variety of pieces, the setting and the overall feel of the game.

Received in trade with epilgrim on 1/28/2011.  Received Viktorias, Lady Justice, 2 Fate decks, the rules, and some random figures.

Sold in my game auction July 2011

I think I may need to get some more of these.

Fantastic skirmish level miniatures game. Malifaux passes several tests for me.

No buckets of dice? Check- in fact, there are no dice, there are cards. Hand management is introduced.

Quality sculpts? Check- these are some of the best minis I've seen.

Small model count? Check. I love a game where I can play without spending hundreds of dollars and man hours on a starting force.

Interesting and quick gameplay? Check- plenty of different scenarios and missions and the rules are simple enough if someone teaches you.

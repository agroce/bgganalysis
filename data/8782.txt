I enjoyed playing this many times in the 70s & 80s, and recently got hold of a copy so I can enjoy it again. I'm a sucker for amphibious invasion games, and this one is a classic.

RATING: 6
Very unbalanced game.  There is something wrong with a game where it is almost impossible to achieve the historical result.  All the Allied player has to do is block the mountain passes and slowly retreat (one hex per turn) to achieve ultimate victory.  This is partly due to the victory conditions and partly due to the awful CRT which hugely favours the defender.  Having said that, it's an enjoyable game with lots of fun elements, and if you like a challenge, play the Germans!

Most of the initiative is with the Germans.  They have to produce a dynamic plan that takes a lot of risks to win. The CRT is so inconclusive that a march over the centre of Norway is not an option. The German player must do their best to capture Trondheim and Narvik in the early landings. None of my friends have won this game as the Germans but we have got close on a number of occasions.

NB
My taste in games has been moving on since 2007. The bottom line is I am no longer enthusiatic about playing longer or unexceptional wargames.   I have downgraded most of my rating inline with this.  The comments reflect my opinion of the games but I have rated the games lower in line with BGG guidance since I am unlikely to be playing them again.

Juego a nivel batallón y con turnos de 3 días de la Serie Europa. Muy difícil ganar con los alemanes; el éxito alemán está en la planificación y en la suerte del desembarco inicial: deben de ocuparse en el primer turno Narvik y Trondheim, y reforzar dichas ciudades con transportes aéreos. El camino desde Oslo hacia el norte se hace muy largo, debido a la no existencia de arrasamientos, la posibilidad de las tropas noruegas de retirarse y una Tabla de Combate que siempre da opción al defensor.

The best of the older GDW EUROPA series games and for years it was the only game on the Norwegian 1940 campaign.  This is one I'd still gladly play, despite its age.

We played Narvik, we had a lot of fun and the next step will be to play Skandinavia.
Having said that, the german plan asks a carefull planning because to win is not easy at all.

I seem to have misplaced my copy of this game.  Lost in Storage?  Or is it "sleeping with the missing socks"?  Must have been a first edition?  My copy came in a large ziplock bag instead of a box and the map did not have as many colors as shown in the gallery photos.  My first exposure to the Europa system.  AFAIK, the first game to cover the topic of the 1940 German invasion of Norway.
Played pre-BGG.

A good introduction to the Europa system as it is at a smaller scale, although Europa scale units for Norway and Sweden are included.  This is a true land/sea/air campaign over difficult terrain, which will present a challenge to both sides.

This game models the invasion of Norway in 1940 in a fascinating way. The Germans have overwhelming ground and air strength, while the Allies have command of the Sea and are defending a long strip of terrain that is notable for its limited access. The Germans will win the fight for southern Norway, however the challenge begins when fighting for the centre and north. Offensive action must be bold, assertive, aggressive and fearless to achieve the goals. Personally I seem to find new ways of losing this every time I play. Over 10 games played evenly between sides, I have never won! As a final note, the game can be played in one long session and does not use Europa standard rules or counters. A great game for players that want to be stretched that little bit further

The Norwiegen campaign is one of my areas of interest, and I understand this is one of the better Europa games.  I remember thinking the cover was pretty cool back in high school when I looked through the shelves in my local bookstore. Haven't punched it yet.

Good game (a little clunky on the rule side) on an obscure topic (WWII operations in Norway).

RATING: 8.5
A visually handsome game and in particular a really creative idea to step aside from Europa norms and present at battalion level. Very difficult for the Allies to establish themselves in the South, and very tough going for the Germans up at Narvik - but then that's the way it was.

Has a bastardized version of the naval system from "Their Finest Hour," the naval system for the rest of the Europa series.  More of a regimental sideshow to the rest of the Europa series.  It is possible for the Germans to win factoring in a few historical modifications utilizing house rules.

Have tried this twice but only solitaire so not sure either player really knew what they were doing. however the rules were pretty good, not much errata and I only had one question that I posted to the Europa group and got an answer to pretty quickly. Its just working out the best strategy, I'm sure the ones I used were not the best ones. There are some AAR's and replays to use as a guide which is a big help.

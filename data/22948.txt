Ugh really?  I am waiting for Munchkin Flux so I can Die the most painful death imaginable!!!

Otherwise known as Munchkin:  Make a bunch of crappy expansions, good for exactly one laugh in a game that should be ten minutes expanded into untold hours of torture wishing that you had the +2 rapier of suicide so you could kill yourself an get it over with all ready!

Said Game will make Steve Jackson Games a bazillion Munchkin Gold pieces off of a really boring, looong, and repetitive game, sold to gamers too brain dead from playing this stupid game to know better than to buy more crappy expansions with the same jokes rehashed over and over and over.

Played one Munchkin game and you've played them all.  A new Munchkin game means a new theme and a new set of jokes to snicker over, so worth it if you like Munchkin.  If you didn't like the original gameplay, you won't like any of the others either.

Fun to pull out for a spy-themed gathering. Set a clock (bomb- style) with a countdown to see who is closest to 10 to shorten the game. Also, if buzzer goes off on your turn, you still lose even if you're in the lead.

RATING: 6.5
I wanted to rate this one a seven, because it's my favorite of the series.  What can I say, I grew up on Bond movies and Mission:Impossible and the Rat Patrol.  However, the crappy card stock kept me from giving it a better rating.  If I'm paying that kind of money for a game, I would at least like to have cards I know are going to stand up to years of shuffling and play.

(As of [b]?[/b] plays) I used to be enamoured of the Munchkin series, which was partially responsible for bringing me to BGG, but it is certainly a game where familiarity can breed contempt. The humour is great, the artwork is perfect, and the concept of reducing the role-playing experience to its shallowest component elements is fun. The fatal flaw is the directionless randomness and the tortuously prolonged time it takes to finish a game.

[b]5 year verdict:[/b] Munchkin was one of the first non-traditional games I bought, and I played a lot of it early on, but I have definitely moved on.

RATING: 8
A more straight-forward theme than even Munchkin, but just as clever and full of fun. The "secret agent man/James Bond" theme is done spot on. Taking down evil geniuses and criminal masterminds while using a pocketful of gadgets and MI:6 abilities has never been so enjoyable.

Now the Munchkins are spies. It's the same old game with a new coat of paint. This is one of my personal favorite editions, but it's mechanically the same game as the rest. Buy this for the silliness, not for the game mechanisms.

Munchkin switches up the code books and bases all of its cards in the new base set on Mission: Impossible, James Bond and a few more entries into the spy genre. Considering that the spy genre was already stale when this came out, it falls a bit flat -- which is a pity because this game has some potential.

PLUS: spy theme, humour, all ages, right out of the box
MINUS: it's missing... something in game play

Fun social game with D&D satire/spoof. The whole game comes down to the 3rd player in line that didn't get a whack load of take-that cards thrown at him/her. The game can drag a while too. This is my least favorite theme.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

I like most Munchkin games when you have the right group of people with the appropriate mindset about the game. Cheat like nobody is watching, do crazy epic shenanigans, and don't take it too seriously!

Quite a good munchkin.  Not as satirically biting as Munchkin Bites, or as fun as Munchkin itself, but still a good romp.  "Items" should have been gadgets, the classes could have been better thought out, some of the Loyalties (russian) are not very true to their character, but the races and loyalties have MUCH more intuitive and playable abilities even than in Munchkin itself!  "gold pieces" makes no sense, it should have been $$$.  Not enough Get Smart, James Bond, Avengers or in fact any well-known spy metaphors, too many silly monsters and not enough "Dr." something type villains.  NOT enough vehicles!  Every spy should have a gadget-mad car!  Cute, just doesn't go the full distance on an otherwise GREAT idea.

One of the best themed Munchkin games that does not get the love it deserves. If you are fan of popular spy series like James Bond or Mission Impossible you should enjoy this spoof of that genre in typical Munchkin fashion. What I do not understand is why have they never made an expansion for this version?

...and yes, there is strategy in Munchkin games through negotiations, when you play cards in your hand or when to go for levels.

It's a fun spoof on the spy/detective theme.  As a James Bond fan I picked it up and added it to my collection.  Its purely for theme, as there is nothing new or different from the base game of Munchkin.  It really comes down to what type of humor you want while you're piling onto to your friends.

We just got the latest of the Munchkin family at our last Christmas gathering.  I'd have to say that this is my second favorite game in the series after the original Munchkin.  The theme and game-play pattern is consistent in all of them, but this has some fun originality in the individual cards that makes them a hoot.

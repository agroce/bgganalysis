With the right group, this one's a blast. Indeed, you're going to have, as a matter of fact, several names that aren't going to be familiar, and it's a blast seeing the various "memes" that will arise with each game (pounding on the wall and grabbing your crotch for "Paulie Walnuts"). There will be the occasional name that never sets, and will thus go to the team with the best memory (or gets it at the right time in the cycle), but overall, with a spirited group, this is good fun that gets you moving.

I was first introduced to this style of party game through the free to play "Three Things" aka "Celebrities", but this can be just as fun.  I prefer to be able to make my own set of nouns, but cool to have an instant copy to bust out when the time strikes.

solid party game.  i'm fairly tired of werewolf and apples to apples, good as it initially was to me, became stale pretty quickly once the cards started repeating.  i'm not excited about repeats here but they do seem to be funnier because of past and often bad clues.  the deluxe version has more cards, a huge box, and a timer.  i think that title recall is much better on content and has a smaller box to boot, so recommending that one.  the core game of http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celebrity_(game) is also very playable.

RATING: 8
I don't usually go in for party games but I have to imagine that this is a serious step in the value of the experience. Usually these games rely a good deal on the enthusiastic contributions of the players and, because of their simplicity, usually get those contributions from a sample of people because of their experience with such games as children. The cleverness of Time's Up is that it observes what makes particular sessions of party games fun - the building inside jokes - and creates a mechanic that supports and enhances it. The gamer in me actually notes that it rewards clever play (!) and, well, the human being in me can't stop laughing whenever I play it. It's a terrific game for opening people up that might have to be dragged into these kinds of games. I was a skeptic but this party game has won me over.

RATING: 9
Everything that made the base game great plus a nifty electronic timer, rules for odd numbers of players, and a hilarious optional fourth round for veteran players. Not quite definitive as rather than a repackaging of the base game + expansions it's actually a collection of "best of" cards from the base game and the expansions plus some swell new cards... but for new players, this is the edition to get. I'm glad I still have my old sets around though!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A very enjoyable game in which you need to explain the person on the card (without saying the name, obviously) to your group. In the first round you can say as much as you want, in the second you can only say one word and in the third round you can only mime... And on top of that, there is a timer! 

Great fun, the only downside is that many of the persons are unknown Americans to us Europeans. We know quite a lot of them, but there are lots of minor American actors and such whom we have never heard about. No big deal as I just make some labels and write the names of Danish actors etc instead. 

All in all it's one of the better party games, but there is really no need to actually buy the game as you can just write down some persons on small pieces of papers yourself and put it in a bowl/hat (which is why the game is also known as "the hat game"); that's actually more fun as you're almost sure that you know most of them, and it's funny to see how creative your friends are when writing the characters to guess.

I had no interest in playing this game until I saw it on sale for $4 at a Barnes and Noble clearance sale.  Being the BGG lurker I am, I knew this game had a very high rank in the Party Games Category,(number 5 at the time of this comment).  So after sitting in shrinkwrap on the shelf for a year, I finally brought it out with a group of 6.  We read the rules and I became even less excited about playing the game when I found out you use the same 40 cards for all 3 rounds.  However, after 2 games and 2 hours of uncontrollable laughter, terrible acting, deciphering ambiguous clues, and good hearted "yo mamma" jokes;  I realized 2 things: 1)My face and cheeks hurt from laughing, and 2) This was the funniest game I have played in a very long time.  I will be buying all other versions of this game I can manage to get my hands on, whether on clearance or not.  This game is worth every penny at full price.

You have to give clues and guess items based on successively more restricted acting, starting with relative freedom to speak and ending in only relative miming. If you can't enjoy that, even when you and your partner are frustratingly not scoring, then you have no soul -- you've got no spirit; you've got no enthusiasm; you'll never be like Zee Garcia or... Alan Gerding.

As party games go, this one is pretty good. Up there with Wits and Wagers, Catch Phrase, and Taboo. The last round where only gestures may be used generally requires some recall of earlier rounds, but I'm not a huge fan of specifically making up your own gestures with your partner in earlier rounds to help later. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Fairly fun party game but still trivia-centric. As someone who doesn't really watch TV and doesn't care about sports there were a lot of people I didn't recognize.

The fact that you can't skip cards in the first round can lead to some very boring turns where you're trying to describe words in a person's name because you have no idea who they are. The second and third rounds where you know the possible answers but can't say as much (or anything) are considerably more fun.

Initial Rating 8.5 (January 2011)

By far my favorite party game (I prefer Title Recall and Geek Edition over this one). It’s Currently in my list top 10 favoritr games. 

This edition adds a fourth phase and comes with a little cool electronic timer.

On the bad side, the game has too many cards unknown to us, our group is very well educated but some of the cards are too foreign for us. (This is why I like more the other 2 versions of the game) however with folks who has more or less the same level of foreign culture, the game is a blast :D.

I totally recommend it.

I love Time´s Up, I always want to play it, in fact many friends are bored by it but I always propose it. There is always enough quorum to play it. I play it almost every week now. I won’t say no to a game of Time´s Up in any form or edition. 

Contrary to what I wrote before, the Title recall edition is the hardest for us because names of series and movies are very different in English and in Spanish so we don’t play it as much. My favorite edition continues to be the geek edition, a great game with my favorite topic (boardgames :P) but nowadays we almost always play one of the Spanish editions.

My family loves it, one of the few games they will play with me.

Bottom line, the BEST party game out there.

One of 2008´s favorites. 
Top Ten game.

I'm not sure if adding an electronic timer is a good thing or not, since sand timers will never need their batteries replaced.  I like the mix of cards with some of the newer additions - it makes it a little more accessible.  Whether or not I would recommend this edition to those that don't any version of Time's Up yet would depend on the price difference.  Though I still prefer Title Recall.

If you own the original, you really don't need the deluxe version. The electronic timer is nice, since it is more precise and it means you don't have someone who has to watch the timer instead of the clues. The new rules can be applied to the original game of course. The odd players rule is nice, obvious if you stop to think about it. The 4th round I wouldn't bother with. That's just going too far.

06-04-2014 - Maybe I'm being too generous at a 9 with a game like this, but what's the point of a game anyway?  To have fun?  On a scale of 1-10, I probably had at least a 9 in fun.  I loved it!  It was hilarious.  I love how it mixes a standard team clue-giving game with a memory mechanic.  Seeing people try to come up with 1-word and then 0-word clues to get people to guess things that have already been mentioned was a blast.  I think this one will go over really well on New Years.  This is a no brainer buy.

06-16-2014 - Dropped to a 7.5.  It's still a good game, but you have to have the right numbers for it to really shine I think.  That is, if you have to set it up to where you're only giving clues to one person to guess, and the correct guesses are only tallied to the clue giver, it's just not as fun as with teams.  But for teams you need a lot of people.  This game can deliver a lot of fun, but only with the right number of people IMHO.  Still good with fewer, not as low as a 7 but I think I'd be pushing it at an 8.  If I continue to only play this with the "right" number of people, I might bump it back up to an 8, 8.5 perhaps.

This is the first Time's Up! game we played.  When we first took it to the family and said lets play this, we didn't understand that the game was supposed to be really hard and that was part of the fun.  So the game was put away for months.  Then we pulled it out with a friend and decided to play it out.  I don't think I have laughed so hard in my life.  People get so desperate to describe their card that you never know what they are going to say or do.  Get the right group, don't worry about looking foolish and enjoy yourself.

Pleasant surprise.  Taaboo, charades, pictionary are fun, but this one blows them away.  The added mechanism didn't sound exciting ... "Give clues for the same names over and over again" but turned out to add tremendous fun to the game.  Much more interactive, you are paying attention when it is other teams' turn. (Based on playing the basic game, haven't seen "Deluxe".)

Time's Up! Deluxe is a blast, and it's great with gamers and non-gamers alike. It's the best party game I've ever played.

At first, the number of people you don't know seems daunting, but the clever mechanic of recycling the deck mitigates that over time. The way it plays on Charades and on the group's metagame is excellent.

For a game with so few rules, those rules all interlock well -- and dovetail with the hilarious metagame that builds up during play. Seeing how different people tackle delivering their clues never disappoints, and it's challenging to do it well.

I definitely like this game, much better than your typical charades.  It's tough to find a good group of people that want to play this, though.  Some of the names are a bit challenging, which frustrates some players.  I find it a unique challenge to get someone to say a name you've never heard of.

An interesting way to implement trivia/charades party gameplay.  The repetition of topics for each round seemed unusual at first, but explaining each answer helps keep less knowledgeable players in the loop and naturally leads to creating inside jokes.

Party game where in round 1 you need to get your teammates to guess the word on the card without using rhymes, music, or the word on the card...many guesses, many hints, can't skip cards.  Round 2 is only one word hints, one guess, CAN skip cards (you are using the same cards from round one).  Round 3 is only pantomine.  Good stuff.

+ Times Up Title Recall

***House Rule***

You can pass on a card, if you think no one will know who/what the title/name is referring to. BUT, at the end when you add up scores, if 50% or more of the players know what it is, then you lose a point.

This may be the best party game we've ever played. Very fun.... you try to get your partner to guess a series of names through descriptions, then a single word, then a gesture. Will definitely have to try this with my non-gaming family members.

My brain is definitely made for this game... really helps to have a good short term memory.

RATING: 7.5
Fantastic party game, but Title Recall version is better. Will occasionally play this for variety.

I quite like the challenge of trying to find ways to describe the names of unheard-of people, but there are just a few too many US-specific references here, so we always deal out a lot more cards at the beginning to give everyone a wider selection to choose from.

When played correctly with a large enough group, this is a fine party game.  Watching as incorrect pantomimes or wrong information is added to the more obscure cards can be quite amusing especially if they become the key to getting your partner to guess something that a previous player did.

Terrific party game. Fun and entertaining.

[b]Edit:[/b] Still a great game but unfortunately this particular copy has proven completely useless because *every* group I have played this with prefers to simply play the public domain variation [b]Celebrities[/b] where we get to write down 8 people down ourselves and guess; seems to always produce more laughs.

If you have a group that can't think of anyone, get this because it does the thinking for you.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Can play this anytime with pen and paper with the free-domain game Celebrities. But I got this anyway, so it looks more like a game, balance issues are kinked out, and you don't get people putting weird-ass Asian pop-star names into the hat.

Setup time is reduced (which is crucial for getting hesitant/dubious non-gamers into the crux of the game, when they realize the genius of repeating clues), but Celebrities does have a more custom/tailored feel.

Cards Against Humanity is the rage now but I find its black humor way too contrived and in-your-face (i.e. we're all being offensive now so nobody is being offensive... haha). I love that ugly biases come out far more naturally and subtly with the associations that grow from a rousing game of Time's Up!, while you're busy laughing.

2+5

A fun party game, but less so if you just don't know who these people are! Also, it can go on a bit too long. Still, one of the best party games out there. Nice to have the electronic timer of the deluxe version!

--- Summary ---
3 phases: 1. trivia-with-clues --> 2. Password --> 3. Charades.  Pretty fun game, but we kept getting stuck on the first card! Unable to pass, we ended up only scoring 1 point in Phase 1! After that, it becomes a short-term-memory game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
When I first heard the simple rules to this game they didn't make sense to me.  Maybe I'm just thick but I didn't get how guessing the same celebrity names in three different rounds (given fewer clues each round) worked.

Now I get it and I love this party game.  You would think after the first round guessing the same celebrity names again would be easy but there are enough names (40 using the basic rules) that you can forget several of the names.  Even in the third round after hearing all the names twice.  Especially in the moment, that moment being just 30 frantic seconds.  The game is simple but opens itself up to a wild good time.  You have to find clever ways to give hints, especially when reduced to just sounds and pantomime.

We have yet to try the fourth "poser round" of the game, it seemed a little too difficult and might drag on forever draining the fun out of the game.

This edition also comes with an electronic timer over the sand hourglass which is awesome.

RATING: 7
Time’s Up is an interesting party game that draws inspiration from charades, Guesstures, Taboo and the like.  But it diverges from those by letting players know some or even all of the answers ahead of time!  Yes, as strange as that may sound, it is true and it makes the game a blast (if you’re into that type of thing).  The game is played in three rounds, each round is plaed differently but with the same cards.  Each card has a name on it that the active player tries to get the others on their team to guess.  The game starts by each player being dealt a number of cards and discarding a couple of them andputting the rest in the center of the table.  The cards on the center of the table are the entirety of what cards get played o the game, so you already know the answers to a small number of the cards.  The first round you can speak and act or do anything to describe the card.  The round ends when all of the cards in the middle have been played.    Te second round goes the same way but the cards are recycled and you can only say ONE word, Then the third round you can’t say ANYTHING only act.

This creates an interesting situation where the players get more and more information of the answers but they get less and less clues from the active player.  To make a long story short much hilarity ensues.  I give this a 7.

This is a classic party game that takes place in 3 rounds.  The first round is taboo, then you take all the cards and shuffle them up again.  The second round you can only say one word, but you can make gestures and noises.  This would be very hard if you didn't already know who all the possibilities were.  Then you shuffle the cards up again and play charades.

The concept is amusing, particularly because your clues for rounds 2 and 3 often revolve around the previous clues instead of the actual person/thing.  For example, one of the cards was some person from the early 1900's with the first name Carry.  The clue in the taboo round started with Carrie Underwood (from American Idol), so all future clues revolved around American Idol.  It's hard to describe, but it gets everyone engaged and creates some good moment.  The concept alone I would rate a 6.

My problem with this particular game is that the references are mostly literature, history, movie references, and celebrities from the 90's. None of those are really in my wheelhouse, so I had no clue what about 1/3 of the cards were.  It felt like I was playing a version of trivial pursuit that was published in the 80's, making pop culture references I didn't understand.

We've played a ton of [gameid=1353] over the years, and find it to be the perfect party game for large, gregarious groups.  My wife and I prefer the 'make your own names' version, but the premade decks here are great for a quick start and for easing the tension for first-timers.

Time's Up! Deluxe was a fun and rowdy experience at BGG.CON. I’d played the party game before, but not the officially produced version, let alone the Deluxe version. Although I couldn’t figure out what was "deluxe" about it, besides maybe the electronic timer. For those who haven’t played, it’s basically a variant on charades. You have a deck of cards with famous people or characters on them, you split into teams, and you try to get your team to guess as many of the cards as possible in 30 seconds. The key innovation that makes the game interesting is that you play 3 rounds. In the first round, you can say or do anything to get your team to guess the right answer, so it’s fairly easy. In the second round, you play through the same deck of cards again, but this time you can only say one word. It’s much harder, but at least your team has heard all the names before so there’s a memory element to it now. In the third round, you cannot say anything, so it’s purely charades plus sound effects. It can be rather difficult at the end, but there were some very clever people at BGG.CON whose silent acting abilities were impressive. There was one gentleman from Los Angeles, I believe, who was remarkable!

My favorite party game.  It includes a "cheat sheet" in case you don't know the "famous" person.  I like the way you use the same card set each round. Every time we play we end up laughing at least once.  The only thing I would change would be to put the "hints" right on the cards instead of on the sheet.  The points don't matter... every game is fun and produces at least one laugh-out-loud moment.

Not exactly what I expected. I really wanted this game to be good and my group to like it, but the game is too Euro/Western centric in many ways. Our group is well educated and really smart folks, but the first round alone was a tough one. Not sure how to make this game easier.

Not very fun for our group.

RATING: 6
Fun game that preceded the "single shooter" PC games.  Only problem is that although the procedure for finding the next page was supposed to obscure which page where the manoeuvre you had chosen would take you, there is actually a way to cheat; which I will not reveal as it ruins the fun for those yet to discover it!

The second slipcase edition makes no changes in gameplay, so it's just as much fun as the earlier edition. What was added was the "all important" legalese trade marks to the game box.

RATING: 10
Second in Nova's Ace of Aces series of WWI air combat games, this one is a bit more difficult to play due to the fact that these planes were faster and less manoeuvrable.  Still great fun though.

A nice game for every now and then.

RATING: 7
A really innovative system, appears to be magic until you figure out its just a 5 by 5 grid.  Still, understanding that does not detract from the enjoyment as you can then actually apply tactics and second-guessing.  Great game for just about anyplace.  Try 2 on 1 sometime, a great challenge for the 1 but quite fun.

A great little game to travel with - can be played almost anywhere. Certainly gives you the feel of a dog-fight as you try to predict your opponent's manoeuvre. Nothing quite like turning to a page to see your guns blazing at the opponent's plane.

Solid, welcome, and engrossing addition to the Ace of Aces line. You can really feel the added power that the later WWI aircraft had over their predecessors in the Handy Rotary series.

RATING: 9
Somewhat simple?  Sure.  But this gets a high rating from me because it was a Christmas gift wayyyyyy back in 1987 or so.  I keep introducing new people to its simplicity and just enjoy bringing along two books as a complete game.  Thanks Uncle James!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Oldie but goodie.  Small enough to fit into a backpack and be played on a bus because it really doesn't require any board or pieces, just two books for the basic game.

Advanced game options and record sheets make a more complicated game that has never really appealed.

RATING: 8
One of the most innovative game designs of all time, and a ton of fun as a simple filler game. Numerous later expansions and rules options added unnecessary complexity to the system. The Powerhouse edition introduced better planes, but I also prefer its inked artwork to the Rotary Deluxe edition's efforts at photos.

RATING: 6
A classic game.  This is very reminiscent of the Wings of War games and I am guessing it was an inspiration.  I played this a lot in my youth and its small, self-contained form makes it a great game for passing the time in a car or train.  Unfortunately, the more advanced rules are heavy on bookkeeping while the basic rules lead to duels that drag on without going anywhere.  It's very easy to get into a pattern of flying around one another without ever making progress.  Trying to make distance to reengage at a different angle usually leads to losing sight of one another and reseting the game.

I love this game for nostalgic value but I think it's only "good" overall.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Ace of Aces is an excellent two player game, even in the basic edition. Doesn't take much space, is easy to teach, and plays well. Alas, it is long, long out of print. The initial three books were the best.

Great game series.  I used to have fun teaching this to newcomers.  It was easy to handicap the contest by using the advanced rules on speed restrictions on maneuver on myself and allowing beginners to use the basic rules.

One great moment was the time an opponent and I went through 8 consecutive pages without "sighting" each other or breaking contact.  My plane was directly below his and we paralleled each other until he broke the wrong way.

RATING: 8
Light for a wargame, but a lot of fun in the Basic Game if played quickly.  Advanced game is fun too, but can get bogged down in the details.  Intermediate game is not enough of either. The best part about this game is that it is pretty easy to teach the mechanics, so it makes a good "gateway wargame". The bad part is that an experienced player will easily outclass a newbie, since getting a feel for how the planes maneuver is critical. The other tough part is getting a copy!

I was introduced to this game while on a road trip to visit a University when I was in Highschool.  The boy who had the game told me about the various games he had.  Until then I thought the game isle at Kmart was the only place to get games and Monopoly, Risk, Stratego were the only board games.  This is a great car trip game.

Love this game but havent played in years.  I had forgotten I still had it till I was searching for a book on my paperback shelves.  Its a casual couch combat game for 2.  I taught my 8 yr old daughter but honestly, she didn't really have a good grasp on 3D thinking at the time.  The game can be very challenging to win with two experienced players.

When I was just a kid, a grown-up WWI buff introduced me to this game & it was one of my favorites.  The game's designers must of had a hell of a time making it flawless in the execution of fliping the pages to show the view of the pilot of one plane in viewing their opponent & vice-versa.  Wow!  That's dedication!  & a great game to play in the backseat of the car on long journies to grandma's house!  Brilliant!  I wish I had others in the series.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
This edition was the first that I had played.  Loved it!  I ended up getting the others in the series.  This game mechanic gave me something that Richtofen's War, Wings, and Knights, etc., did not....a real, three- dimensional feel for what I was trying to do with my aircraft.  Air Combat Maneuvering worked like a charm.  The aircraft included in the game may or may not have been modeled one hundred per cent accurately.  But, the subtle differences between the opposing aircraft can be appreciated/exploited.  Oh, the compactness and ease-of-play of this game cannot be forgotten.  I don't have any other game (save a deck of poker cards) that is as easily transported and played anywhere.

The Powerhouse series is a little less maneuverable and therefore a little less interesting. Still a great game though.  Plays very well with the Handy Rotary set.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Second (and widely regarded as second to best) installment of the unique Ace of Aces series, in which two players fly a combat plane against each other by flipping the pages of a book: in each page the player gets the view from the cabin and several options for manoeuvring.

In the Powerhouse Series the planes are quicker and the manoeuvres less spectacular than in the Handy Rotary Series, but the planes are still balanced, the plays are still tense from start to end... and both series are compatible. As it comes down to taste I can't really say this volume's worse than the other - both are simply faultless.

These planes are a nice addition, although I find playing the Rotaries to be more satisfying in a basic game.  However, the Powerhouse planes shine when the advanced altitude rules are in play.

Very clever game, no board -- each of the two players has a book and depending on your moves you look up various pages in the book to check the outcome and then do it again.  I had fun with this in the early 1980s, but haven't played it since.  I do recommend it.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
A great game - graphics are not great, but the playability is awesome.... It is strictly aerial combat, plane against plane.

No worry about supplies or calculating resources. It's all about maneuvering your plane into striking range and avoiding being shot down while you do it

The game is turn based but both turns are at the same time, resulting in some extremely exciting and fun scenarios where the hunter becomes the hunted.

Stictly one on one, this one can't be done solo. You need a buddy to out fly, or be out-flied by....

The best game I've ever played bar none!

Had to buy this one when it came out.  Many plays "back in the day".  For the Ace of Aces enthusiast - didn't really add that much to the Handy Rotary, at least while playing the base rules.  100+ plays back in the 80's.

Unlike the Handy Rotary game (which I love!) this one runs into trouble with planes zooming past each other.  It's so easy to jump the gas and end up on page 223.  The Handy Rotary is the definitive edition of Ace of Aces.

Yay, I have a copy. It's innovative and fun, but with basic rules it boils down to a simple bluffing game in the end. Still, it really is the ultimate travel game -- you can even play it standing in a queue.

One of the most original games ever!  Simultaneous movement and combat, fog of war, all in a couple of sturdy softback books you could tote around with you anywhere.  Out of print, but well worth chasing until you get it.

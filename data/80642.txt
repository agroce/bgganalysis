Essen 2010.  To AH Apr-11.

This is a very clever and accomplished design.  The players' ant hills reminded me of Mac Gerdts' rondels, but were more flexible.  The level of the hex in the hill indicated how often the power could be used.  There was a nice tension in deciding how to construct the hill.  The anteater penalties were nicely balanced - ants on one mound were eaten by the last anteater arriving whilst the first two anteaters removed a bug.  The anteaters seemed a bit incongruous as the game did not feel to be set in South America - especially with the types of flora and fauna used.  Most of the jokes and comments in the rules were amusing.  I especially liked the comment on page two that said 'It's OK - the last 10 pages are the German rules!'  (and vice versa in the German rules).  The 'pedant' token though was a joke to far though.

In summary, the game had a much more polished feel than some of the other Fragor games and Antics felt like a real German game, which is meant as a compliment.  Apart from starting order there was no luck involved.  Plenty of decisions.

On the down side, the end game felt to be biased to the player who triggered the end game.  I think the tension and balance would have been better if the player triggering the end game did not get an extra turn at the end.  Unfortunately the game played quite slowly and AP set in with a couple of players.  There was a limit to how much forward planning you could do before your turn.  So a worthy effort, polished design, but not one I want to play too often.

A change of direction for the Lamont Brothers and a significant step up into deep thinker strategy games that surpasses everything that they have produced to date.

A lot to take on board and a need to be flexible keeping a weather eye out for what the other players are up to. The Ant eater mechanism is sublime and offers a looming penalty for those who fail to prepare and an obstacle in the selction of tiles.

My one criticism is the board artwork which has a dubious colour palette and garish illustration that detracts from an awesome game. You also need to repaint one set of ants.

A very clever game, G&F you have raised the bar.

Initial Impressions:
----------------------
Not a huge fan of the theme or artwork, but there was for sure an interesting game in the box.  A short thinky game which I am a little shocked at this point has not been reprinted.  Not sure I agree with some of the complaints that the game suddenly ends, since too me part of the game is mixing your engine with scoring points based on what other players are doing.  Looking forward to playing this one again, but don't need to acquire a copy

RATING: 7
My new favorite abstract.  As a bonus, it includes pick-up-and-deliver which is one of my favorite mechanics.  I love the turn angst since you must cover hexes on your ant hill as you build up or collect food tokens.  Unfortunately, there are some component issues--the board is too busy (making it hard to find things) and two of the four player colors are natural (one has a VERY light coating of brown wood stain, but the two colors are VERY difficult to tell apart, especially in poor light conditions).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Another clever Lamont Brothers design. This one piles tiles on top of each other up to a height of 5 levels, as higher tiles give more actions. It's also got route building and item shipping, but it's the building the ant hill bit that stands out.

Possibly Fragor's best yet - and I'm a fan of their other games - featuring an innovative and fascinating nest-building mechanism that drives the game and determines your actions; which are nicely thematic.  Deserves to be picked up and re-published so that more people can experience it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Antics is a fairly innovative game with some interesting new mechanisms that I thought were pretty cool.

Central to the game is your ant colony which you can build on over the course of the game.  The symbols on your ant colony determine which actions are available to your during your turn.  You can also build your colony up by building over other tiles.  The higher the tile, the more efficient the action.  For instance, placing an ant using level 1 ant placement lets you place 1 ant, whereas level 4 lets you place 4.  So there is always tension between building up to get better actions, but covering up other ones while you're at it, or building out to maintain flexibility.  Cool stuff!

Other than than, it's basically a pick-up-and-deliver game where you're stringing together ants to make deliveries which score you points in the end.

Even though the main mechanism was cool, I wasn't completely enamored with the game.  No doubt I'd be happy to play it more, but it's not something I'd actively seek to play.  I actually can't put my finger on why; it just didn't completely grab me despite its attractive qualities.

The anthill is really cool, and I don't mind the artwork at all, though it can be a bit busy to see what's going on.  There seemed to be some fragility to the game in that if people drew lots of tiles, the game just moved to a rapid end before anything really got going.  The anthill reminds me of Taluva, which is probably the better game.

There are things I liked about this game - the stacking and action multiplication mechanic seemed novel.  Even the game timer was pretty cool.  But it was just not fun.  We got through it and I was glad the game was over.  I didn't feel like there were fun an exciting strategies I wanted to try next time I played.  I just felt done with it.  Plus, and this is coming from someone who likes gaudy things, the board was hard to look at.

The anthill building mechanism in itself is brilliant, one of the most innovative mechanisms in the last few years, but the board play is unfortunately pretty boring. It's supposed to be a logistics game, but it never really comes to that. Also, the artist should be locked away for his choice of colours. It hurts the eyes just trying to decipher which road goes where.

Antics!, by the Fragor Brothers, is an action point game, where the players are competing to collect a limited supply of insects and leaves from the board, using a number of different actions that allow the players to either expand their board presence or build up their anthill, and thus their ability to take actions.

The anthill is the most unique part of the game and, for the most part, its defining feature. A player has three actions per turn from a menu of five possible action types. By building up the anthill, a player can provide themselves the ability to perform an action more than once per round and/or perform it more efficiently; the higher an action is on the anthill the more times it can be performed in a turn. This leads to a natural desire to build up the anthill in order to perform more efficient actions. However, eventually someone has to break from this building process, in order to make a points grab, granting them a tempo advantage, and changing the general structure of the game irrecoverably.

The two items that grant points are insect prey, which give points based on how many different types you collect, and leaves which give you points for having fungus tiles revealed on your anthill. Generally, the leaves are each at unique, generally remote portions of the board, while each of the prey types has one location on the board, but multiple prey options are available, with the available quantity decreasing thanks to player acquisition and the threat of the anteaters.

The anteaters provide an extra amount of time pressure on the game, as they consume different types of prey and punish individuals who keep their ants in the hatcheries rather than moving them out to the board.

A lot of the tension in the game comes from the various races that emerge from this grab; individuals will spend time building their anthills and steadily taking more efficient actions, until someone frantically pushes out onto the board, gobbling up insect and leaf tokens, and threatening to push the game to a close. As individual resources threaten to dry up, this forces other players to either compete for the same resources or bide their time until they get an opportunity, to run out even more efficiently, grabbing resources in such a way that they can catch up with those who have chosen to extend themselves earlier. The game isn’t entirely about building up and then just letting your engine run, though it potentially can be; instead there will frequently be frenzied races for point opportunities, particularly in the face of the arrival of anteaters or the last of a particular prey going away, which are followed by new periods of building up the anthill in order to be a little bit more efficient the next time out or to push the fungus piles a little bit higher in order to get a better score out of their leaves.

All of this combines into a fast and fun low-luck light game which provides quite a bit of interesting decisions in a short amount of time. Unfortunately the interplay variability is a bit low for my tastes. I appreciate the game more than I love it, and after seven plays decided I had had enough of the game, trading my copy away.

A great mixture of mechanics. Luck-less, tight fun with network-building, fighting ants - tough decisions and still family-friendly. You build up your own 3D ant-hill to create more valuable action options, ant-eaters are threatening to eat away prey and ants, you want to do at least 6 things at a time, but are only allowed to do three. And there is more interaction in there as it seems at first glance.
Superb.

Thank you FTL Sekrit Santa!   =)

I received this from the FTL Sekrit Santa way, way back in 2010... and we finally got it to the table!   It's a great game, but it does have at least a 1-game learning curve to figure out what you're doing (or at least part of that first game!)   I'm looking forward to playing again, but we'll need to have another player on hand, as Mr. B (who is a bit under the age requirements) didn't quite understand it, and it takes 3 or 4 players.

Another almost great game that has uneven elements in its design. What is great about the game is the action building mechanic. You build an "ant mound" which is your pile of actions available to you. You build horizontally to give yourself more actions and vertically to give yourself more powerful actions. This is an interesting and clever mechanic as you not only have to build over actions as you build upwards, but the things you have your ants collect come back to your ant mound and cover up actions (and can't ever be moved). It's an entertaining puzzle to build your own action set as the game goes on. 

Unfortunately, the rest of the game doesn't match that mechanic. If it did, this would be a 9 or 10 for me. In particular, we didn't find much interaction via the army ants action; people would just wait till they could move something all the way home.

RATING: N/A
After first play: 3 player. We made several mistakes: 1) We used all three bugs of each type. 2) We forgot that on the first turn the first player only got one action, and the second player got only two actions. 3) We did not refill the tiles board as tiles were taken. Thus, we had no tiles beyond the Anteaters until all three reached the first field. 
All of these rules made a huge difference in the game, as we discovered during our second game! So, we had a run-away winner as James got 6 bugs and a level 3 brown leaf for 39 points. I had 15 and Ken 12.
Second play was much better and 3rd play was even better as we began to see our mistakes and honed our playing skills.
An excellent game IMO.

This is the Ford Taurus SHO of board games. A high performance engine is used to power a pedestrian, unappealing vehicle - which just feels like wasted potential. The Ant Hill action system is cool, it just needs to be matched to a better game.

For those who are confused by the board, the colors are (from left to right): yellow vomit, green magic marker, blue vomit, brown vomit, gray vomit, red vomit. Hope that helps. Also, remember that only an ant* hatched in red vomit can enter the shit stain.

* and by ant, I mean "wooden sled sculpted by someone who has clearly never seen an ant."

In spite of the drawbacks, the game is a good one.  The theme is clever and relatively novel.  There are no dragons, elves, medieval merchants, or castles and towers to build.   That alone is refreshing.  But it has much more going for it than the theme.  It has many aspects for players to consider and manage, and many challenges to master.  In my opinion, it is the best game yet from the affable Lamont Brothers.

This has been on my 'I need to get played list' for some time.  Not really because I wasn't very interested in getting it to the table, but because I was afraid to teach it.  Something about it makes it a daunting prospect for me to teach.  I don't mind the board and kind of think it makes it a bit more 'unique' because of it's earthy tones it's using.  

Teaching wasn't quite as bad as I thought it was.  The colors weren't too bad in game play, although one player had a bit of trouble.  Although, he had a few problems with rules in general.

It was an enjoying game of 'building'.  I  felt there were several ways of going about getting done with the anthill.  But, it seemed to come to a quick and unexpected end.  Not sure if it's always that way or it 's just how it came about.  I guess that's good, I was thinking that it was going to start to over stay it's welcome a bit and then all of a sudden it ended at the right time.

The theme integration is charming and clever.  Well worth a look.

I like the mechanisms implemented in the game very much.  Especially the idea of expanding anthill both sidewards and upwards (combined with the power of actions).  
BUT - as a whole the game is bland and I'd gladly see these mechanisms used in a longer game.  Here, before you can fully start to enjoy them, the game abruptly ends.  The game as it is, is in fact a bland, quick race for a few tokens.

The graphics is BAD.  In fact, the board is the ugliest board I've ever seen.

RATING: 6
To be fair, my one play of this was at the end of a long day of playing new games.  So it may be the fatigue talking, but I didn't quite see how to play well on my first exposure to this game.

But on another level, this is a action point game.  You nned to optimize your actions so that you can do more and more.  While this is perfectly valid as a game idea, it has been done a lot of ways before this game.  I didn't really see anything all that fresh here.

Graphically, the game is odd.  Playable, but the board does seem very busy, and doesn't convey the sense of fun I would hope for.  As I played, I kept imagining how if this were a Doris and Frank game it would have had more fun and humor leavened into the game materials.

Instead the game appears largely realistic on the board.  The illustrations on the ant hills have a bit of lightheartedness to them.  Only in the rules does the sense of whimsy appear fully, with the many puns offered.

So I didn't hate it.  But I certainly didn't love it.  I'm not particularly motivated to play again, but wouldn't nix the idea.

One of the few hits for me from the Fragor Brothers. The game has several cleaver mechanics, with the construction of a player’s anthill being the most novel. The game is part puzzle, part efficiency and part race. With a variable game ending, many players are caught off guard by the abrupt ending having spent too much time on their hill. Finding the correct balance between action development and prey/leaf acquisition is an important part to the game. Plays well with 3 & 4. Although I have become used to them, the board graphics are very distracting. Hopefully this will be picked up with new artwork. Otherwise a fun and quick game that has a lot of interesting mechanics I enjoy.

LIKES:

* You build your own anthill which determines which actions you are able to take.  In addition, you build up which grants you extra actions of the same type.  
* The tension between building up (more actions) and building out (more options for actions / storage for prey) is fascinating. 
* When you carry prey back, you have to place it on one of your anthill action spaces meaning you've blocked that action for future use and cannot build over it.  You need to plan ahead so you don't store prey where you want/need to build over in the future!
*Anteaters are an interesting mechanic which can quickly deprive people of potential points by making scarce prey even more scarce!
* There is significant tension between building up your anthill to maximize your actions, carrying out your actions, and the end of the game.  The more you build your anthill, the closer the end of the game.  Pacing is huge in this game and your first play will often see the game end quite abruptly with very few people being prepared for this to happen.

DISLIKE:

* I didn't mind the board at first, but as play continued it was a bit of an eye sore...:-)  One other player found it difficult to see where the paths started and ended.

1 play with 4.

First: This is the worst artwork I've seen since the cover of Roads and Boats; and I didn't have to stare at that art the entire game :(

The game is very abstract and takes quite a while for everyone to build up meaningful levels of action ability. To compound this the most interesting parts of the game happen in the last 15 minutes, after playing nearly an hour.

Finally, the scoring is so tight that things could go in any direction at any given moment. 

While I love the idea of building your hill for actions and the ability to play with the triggering of the anteaters I just cannot like this game as much as I'd like to.

This is a great little game. One of those things where you are given 3 actions but it's still not enough. There is always 1 more thing you need to do. Especially when there is an opposing anthill full of ants that have no problem just taking your food from you.

The Lamont's came up with another unique game.  Antics! has a strong theme and is one half pick-up-and-deliver and one half tile-placement.  With the the tiles you build your individual anthill and place upon it in order to activate powers.  It's an intriguing system but seemed plodding at times.  While food is being delivered by to the ant hills amongst the board it needs to be defended lest an opponent steal it on it's route.  The endgame condition seems unfair as players may not have an equal number of turns.  

While I did not love the game I appreciate Fragor's effort and hope to see more from them.

How happy I am to have this game! You can't find it in the store now, no reprint as other games of Fragor edition. This is a family game. You have a nice mecanism to build your anthill and the interaction on the boardgame is quite fun. Perhaps we can blame it its design, sometimes not clear for certain people. I love it, more than Myrmes (another game with ants), cause I find it funnier.

Mi trovo in controtendenza ma il gioco non mi è piaciuto: per nulla banale è un gioco non privo di strategia; ciò che però non mi ha convinto è l'ambientazione (giudizio molto personale), la poca interazione e soprattutto le pause troppo lunghe tra una fase attiva e l'altra (soprattutto se giocato in 4). Mi riprometto di riprovarlo per rivedere il mio giudizio, anche perché l'idea della costruzione del formicaio è simpatica.

Nice. Trying to balance the expansion of your nest with the expansion on the board is cleverly done. The one thing that disappoints is the production. The board looks a mess. although once you're playing it quickly makes sense - the problem being getting opponents to see past that. And the tan and natural coloured pieces are very similar in shade...

The ant-hill mechanism is very interesting. The players have to decide on which action-space they built other tiles or place food. So they have to give up some action-spaces, to level up other actions.
In a four player game i disliked, that we had not the time to transport much food to the ant hill in the playing-time. No player had more than 3 tiles of food or leafes on his ant-hill.

A nice optimization game! I found it very compelling and well designed. The graphic may support the gameplay a little better and the ants (white and colorless ones) look too similar. The rest is fun! As there are many options that can be calculated through there may be some analysis paralysis.

The first time through the pacing of the game caught me off guard.  I thought I'd have way more time to score points, but did not.  Additionally, the board makes it difficult to tell the distance between two points at a glance.

My second play was far more interesting.  Understanding the pacing, and the tension between building and scoring is critical.  I lost to the tie breaker (I only had 3 levels while the winner had 5), but that reinforced (for me) that getting to higher levels isn't critical to performing well.

The core mechanic is fantastic.  Building that anthill and the order in which tiles come out is a fascinating puzzle.  On it's own, it wouldn't be terribly exciting though.  Adding in the fact that building up your anthill inherently brings the game closer to ending and the fact that you still need to score points at some point makes for a very tense experience.

I look forward to exploring this one more. :)

Another one of those games that feels like an engine building game, but the game ends as your engine gets going. Which is odd. But perhaps strategies will become more apparent as it's played a few more times.

I liked the development of the anthill being built up higher and higher for more potential points and better actions as well as changing one's available actions as lower level choices are covered up.  At its heart still a pick-up-and-deliver game with ant trails instead of train tracks.

Played only once. That's the most ugly board I have ever seen! I like that it's  a fast game, yet requires careful thought and love the mechanics of choosing what actions are available to you (and how powerful) by building your anthill. I'm not sure how well the rest of the game works, will need more plays.

RATING: 6
This is not a bad game by any means.  But the good ideas are almost exactly cancelled out by the bad ones, which leaves a bit of an odd taste.  For someone who hates spatial games I liked the "build your anthill" minigame a lot.  But I hated the "make trails" part on a really horrible board.  I liked the ant-eaters, but hated the "insect clearance" that went with them.  I liked the "fungus and leaves" but hated the scoring system overall.  
There's a good game in here somewhere.  But I think it needed a little more development work.

A game about ants that is really a train game.  I think it was a guarantee that I would like this game.  However, my initial investigation left me very uninterested .  It wasn't until I played it at BGG.con that I knew I would get it.  Of course, I like the pick up and deliver mechanism.  I also like the building of the anthill with the tradeoffs in improving your abilities with having places to store your goods.  Overall, yet another excellent game from the folks at Fragor.

First let's talk about the board:
When you're sliding into first
and you feel a great big burst
Diarrhea! 
Diarrhea!

Like many of the Fragor Games stuff, this is much cooler in concept than in gameplay.  I love the anthill building (the puzzle of it vs the strategy of actions is fantastic), but the board play is rather uninteresting and the game is over right when it starts to get intriguing.  I love pick up and deliver games, but as you can get stuff stolen it makes more sense to make your connection, build up a long ship and just send it home all at once with no threat.  So, you don't really get to see the pick up or deliver.

Meh.

I really like the novel mechanic of how you build your anthill and the power of your actions is how high you can go.  At the same time, you are covering up possible actions, so the choices are quite interesting.  The game is very thematic and you do feel like you're working on an ant colony.  The one issue is that there did seem to be quite a bit of downtime between turns.

A game about ants. I'm not a player who likes to play in games. I like to play games. A theme like Antics in a pick up and deliver kind of game, with worker placement, doesn't make me terribly happy, sort of speaking. Lamont Brothers are innovative and they have something new to offer on their designs. That's something positive about this game - it has neat components and a few nice and clever ideas. I found the game a bit solitaire (despite players have the option to fight for items, the truth is that nobody did anything alike). The only interaction available was for a couple of leaves and even that resulted in a boring 2 happenings during the whole game. So, a cute solid design about ants.

Perhaps the first Fragor game I've really enjoyed. Pick up & deliver with a novel action-selection mechanism, although initial impressions are that the routes seemed a little gentle - easy to avoid risking stolen deliveries by building routes first then switching to complete delivery actions later. Not a big fan of the artwork, though.

I really enjoyed this. You've got two games going on at once; building your anthill to create the actions you want is a fun puzzle like challenge with a very nice physical construction element. Racing to food on the main board presents an interesting logistical challenge with a lot of competition.

This game was a bit frustrating for me as a lot of things you do are hit or miss. There's this one insect or leaf you're trying to get, so you work towards that goal only to see it taken away just before you can do it, which means you've just wasted a lot of actions on 0 points. So you set yourself a new goal in the hopes your timing works out better this time.

I see why some people might like this, and I liked how you can build up your anthill, but this isn't for me.

My favorite Fragor Bros. offering so far.  Antics! is a superb pick-up-and-deliver game that hinges on an ingenious action-selection "anthill" mechanism.  It's the perfect example of a seamless integration of theme with mechanism. You build your anthill by stacking tiles; the higher the tile (in terms of the number of levels from baseline), the more powerful the action you can take with that tile. However, in stacking your tiles to gain power per action, you also inevitably cover other tiles whose actions you will consequently lose. The dilemma that soon emerges is: Do I construct a broad ant pile, meaning one that comprises more but individually weaker actions?  Or do I construct a higher ant pile with a less diverse but a more powerful repertoire of actions? Finding the sweet spot, which of course also depends on the status of other players' anthills, provides a nice tension throughout the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Building your own anthill is fun, but the game is a bit too harsh when you spend several turns building up your network and have someone steal the resources from you, rendering several turns meaningless.  The verdict is: ok game, not more.

RATING: 7.5
Very interesting mechanics. Love the ant hill action mechanism and the hatchery. Not sure about the ant eaters though. The artwork could definitely be improved and distinguishing between the natural and white ant pieces is nearly impossible.

Lots of options in the game and the ant tiles will come out differently each game, so replayability should be good. Definitely looking forward to more games to explore the depth of the game more.

I like the turn control mechanic of the ant hill, but all in all this game just didn't grip me for some reason. 
Totally seems like it would be my sort of game but it isn't.

Also, the board looks like a a surrealist painter vommited on it.

RATING: 7.5
In regards to the AP problems some people adress: we played the game with four firsttimers in 1,5 hours, including rules explanation and the gameplay was flowing smoothly along. However I can see there's potential for AP. We really played it fast and furious. 

And to admit, we didn't anticipate that emptying the bag would take this short and final score was really low (14-12-8-6). 

I really like the mechanic of piling up your actions and  by that simulating an anthill in the making.  
I am not so sure about replayability. There's tons of decisions you can take and it's true that every turn you wish to do more than you can.

But in the end it seems like a decision on:
- either build your anthill strong and big and later on have the opportunity for a large infrastructure (and hope that the others as well as the anteaters will not have taken away all the prey by then)
- or do LESS anthill building and instead bring ants to the board early (trying to take away the prey before other player's infrastructure is built up)

GAME: Greedy Greedy Goblins
RANK: 4068
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
House rules:

To prevent unfair advantages when scoring roll a d10 before scoring the mines.  Count starting from the Guild Hall.  Score that mine first, then move around the circle as normal from there.

Each round, move the Guild Hall 2 spaces around the circle (this gives each player a more even chance to have the Guild Hall near/far from them).

Not usually a speed game fan, but some reviewers brought up a good point of being able to take your time a bit and be a little more mindful about where you place things. Love the bits too.

RATING: 6
The semi-dexterity aspect of this game is kind of messy, it's difficult to go fast and place the tiles properly on the right mine and make sure you dont make mistakes with the rules regarding torches and make sure you don't play on a mine someone has already claimed, etc etc. Good for quick silly fun but not a whole lot to it.

RATING: 6
Solid filler with great components. Two issues: I think of this game as sort of a party game. Because of that, I think it needs to go to 6 players... and I think the game lasts a bit too long, so losing the "-5" if your Goblin blows up rule would be helpful.

Too chaotic for us in real time. We started keeping a verbal metronome -tile - claim? - tile - claim? - and enjoyed it much mors. Really needs 5 denomination coins.

Game has a lot of similar feeling to Galaxy Trucker, but condensed, and didn't seem to generate any of the annoyance/rage that your ship being destroyed by pirates does in that game.  Tiles are bakelite, not much more weight than chipboard would be, but the chunkier size feels better and will likely work for the children this seems aimed at.  Needs new coinage, as there's only 1s and 10s, and you deal in 5s a lot.  Minion rules are easy to misplay, and the guild hall tile DESPERATELY needs a fix.

This game just came to the game store and we all LOVE it! I hate speed games but this is unlike any speed game I have ever played. My husband beat our 16 year old son who is not only lightening fast, but is a very strong gamer. I lost the first game but still had a great time. There is quite a lot of strategy and trickery in this fun little game.

SUSD talked about this Richard Garfield (!) game and how fun the meta is, figuring out each other's strategy in where they're grabbing and putting tiles. Definitely a fun little mad romp. Has minion cards that help get points or out of a jam.

Bought at The Guardtower randomly right after reading the review just because.

Traded away at Origins'16 Math Trade. Simple, fun 4 player game, but just wore out it's novelty quickly with my group. Has a bit more deep meta once you start trying to figure out what red herrings and fake outs other people are doing, but figure it was worth the time put in but would rather have something else.

Simple, push-your-luck game with neat elements of bluffing and sabotage.  Especially love that it has fun reveals as each tile is flipped over in each cave.  You get that "oh, I should have gone for that cave" moment or the "gotcha" moment when you see how an opponent zapped you with extra dynamite.

A cool little realtime gem of a game. Stressful if you want to, but you can also play it slow and tactically and just observe your opponents playing and abuse that instead.

Richard Garfield hat mal wieder zugeschlagen. Gierige Goblins ist ein super einfaches und total chaotisches Echtzeitspiel. Die Spieler wollen Schätze sammeln und in ihre Mienen schaffen. Dabei drehen alle Spieler zeitlich (mit einer Hand) Plastikplättchen um und verteilen diese auf die zur verfügung stehenden Mienen. Irgendwann markiert man eine Miene als "seine" Miene. Gibt es keine Mienen mehr, folgt die Auswertung. Doch Vorsicht: Zuviel Dynamit kann den gesamten Schatz in die Luft jagen. Gierige Goblins ist extrem kurzweiliger und chaotischer Echtzeitspaß, als Einstieg, Absacker oder für Zwischendurch. Nicht mehr, aber auch nicht weniger.

RATING: 6.5
Enjoyable party game, and I love simultaneous play games where you root around in a heap of tiles. (Galaxy Trucker!) -- However, this could have been just a titch better as a release with two improvements:

1) better components: the tiles are fine, but the goblins are flat featureless poker chips. Seriously. Just putting a sticker with the clan's logo on them would have sufficed! Or even better a real figurine! -- The card stock is also thin. And it needs some 5-point coins not just 1 and 10 point.

2) totally misjudging the appropriate number of players. This is the kind of game that would be better with 4-6 not 2-4 players. More tiles and mine cards would have solved this problem. I have no idea why this game even suggests playing it as 2-player--totally the wrong kind of game for that.

OTHERWISE, I really like this game. Not a great one, but a good one.

Video Review: https://youtu.be/nWzpxjzcImo

Greedy Greedy Goblins is a another gateway/filler winner from Richard Garfield. Lighter than both King of Tokyo and Treasure Hunter, but also considerably quicker.

It is a real time game where players simultaneously draw face down tiles, look at then and place them on one of a number of mine cards. Players are trying to build a good stash of gems for themselves and trick other players into taking a bad stash. Dynamite adds as a multiplier unless you get to much. When ever they want players can claim a mine by placing a token of their colour on it meaning that no more tiles can be placed there.

It becomes a cat and mouse game of trying to work out what your opponents are doing - setting a trap or building a nest egg? Do you claim it or not? All while trying to do your own things. A one trick pony? Probably but a highly enjoyable one!

My only negative is with some component choices - the goblin tokens are just big tiddly winks, the coins only come in denominations of 1 and 10 (if you blow up you owe the bank 5) and the single dynamite tiles can be easily mistaken for torches in the heat of the moment.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The rush of setting and avoiding 'traps' is the major deciding factor in a player's enjoyment of this title. One of the only real-time push your luck games I know of, it is worth experiencing for that reason alone.

Yup! Quick and Controlled Chaos! Fun! Kids will like this, too. Lots going on, without being overwhelming. This is a very good production. It's not Garfield's King of Tokyo, but I believe this one should climb the ranks a lil' bit, if enough people get to try it.

2 player game is fine, but I believe the game shines with more players.

This is a fun game to play with the kids, they like the fast pace and even my 5 Year old Twins picked it up pretty quick. There is not much depth to the game but it keeps the kids busy and keeps their interesting as there is not much waiting around for others.

if you like hectical games, it´s a good choice.
i prefer more order.
my variant:
players play clockwise.
on players turn he has three actions. for each action he can choose
a) to draw a tile and put it in one mine or
b) put one of his goblins in a mine (make safe)
with this version it´s easiliy a "8"-point--game

[url=https://www.boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/210126/item/4693525#item4693525]1 partial play[/url]

It's a speed game: players simultaneously look at a face down time from the center, then place it on an open mine card spread around the table. Everyone has 2 claim chips which they may use at any time, to claim and close a mine. When everyone has claimed 2 things (mostly mines; there is also a bar where multiple players may go to claim a minion), you resolve the tiles one by one (players may play minions to modify results, too). Tiles are mostly gems worth 1 point (or 2 depending on your personal playmat). But there are also dynamite tiles (1 or 2 are 2x or 3x multipliers, respectively, but 3 or more explode and cost you 5 points), monsters (eat one gem), and minions (take the top card of the deck; these usually give you powers when you use the card in a future turn). Play till someone has X points and wins the game!

Fun game, I guess, but to light and fluffy for me.

RATING: 6
First impression was that it's a pretty fun little filler.  I'll have to see if going for guaranteed small numbers of points is a little too overpowered.  In a chaotic, quick filler like this, I really enjoy the realtime simultaneous play in order to keep everybody constantly involved and interested.

This is a quick, light game that borrows a lot from [thing=31481][/thing].  In real time, you each look at tiles that either give treasures or negative effects, then put them face down on several different mines.  At any time, a player can claim one of the mines and no more tiles can be added to it.  So you're scrambling to look at as many tiles as you can - hopefully building up a nice juicy mine for yourself - while trying to screw up or confuse other people.  There are also some allies that can give you one time effects to modify a mine after you've chosen it.

If you like the real-time component of [thing=31481][/thing] you should check this out as a lighter, more accessible alternative.

More post-MTG Garfield, exploring an intrinsically exciting mechanic: draw a nicely made face-down tile from a pool, get a quick hit of surprise at what you see, place it in a 'mine' while watching your opponents do the same; periodically claim mines, stopping worker placement, at the risk of finding your opponents have laid enough dynamite to rob you of points, rather than jewels to score them.

The simultaneous-placement action can be thoughtful or frenzied, depending on the players' approach. It's simple enough for young kids to grasp -- simpler than King of NYC, less forgiving than Sushi Go because it's a bit of a race, like a crazy-quilt Carcassonnee -- yet as with all Garfield's game, a moment of strategic thinking mitigates the randomness without diminishing the mounting excitement (and confusion). Doesn't get much play in our kids' group for some reason, but every time it hits the table we have a great time.

Available dirt cheap nowadays, and worth snatching up a copy if your kids are looking for a more viscerally rewarding tabletop experience (and can resolve 'No *I* played my tile first!' arguments gracefully).

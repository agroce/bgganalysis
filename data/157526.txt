Good new card game.  Shares some parallels with [b]7 Wonders[/b] without being derivative.  Good design and many ways to approach this.  I really like the spatial organization and the short(ish) play time.  Auctions may be a little funky with 4 players.  Incredible art!

It is tableau building game, where first of all you bid with so called gemstones (four colours) for cards, then you build them and take advantage of their special abilities. Ypu have to build a pyramid using these cards as at the end the height determines a lot your standing on the victory chart. Then you have somw law cards which allow you to gain some extra benefits. Overall it is a nice game, an abstract one I would say as the theme doesn't fit at all. The mechanics is easy teachable to newbies, but the game overall lacks to suspense needed to catch on.

I enjoyed the pace of this game with the bid interaction and the way the pyramid works with cards getting different benefits depending on the floor of the pyramid. The artwork and presentation are good. Replayability seems good since the cards have these different effects depending on the floor.

My only complain is that the game doesn't really fulfill any theme at all, the mechanics doesn't contemplate nothing even close to the theme it purposes.

So after all it didn't impress me too much, but I would certainly play it again.

A tile-laying victory-point salad that is actually quite enjoyable in spite of the garish art. Almost multi-player solitaire, but not quite.

Unfortunately, the theme was left at the docks when Viceroy shipped.

And (just because everyone is comparing them) 7 Wonders is the MUCH better game, and even Splendor is somewhat superior.

Card drafting παιχνίδι ανάπτυξης tableau με απλό σύστημα πλειστηριασμού για την αγορά των καρτών. Όλες οι κάρτες/χαρακτήρες είναι διαφορετικές μεταξύ τους και έχουν διάφορα abilities ανάλογα με το επίπεδο που τις τοποθετείς στην προσωπική σου πυραμίδα. Το artwork είναι όμορφο και το παιχνίδι έχει γενικά γρήγορο ρυθμό. Βοηθούν και οι απλοί κανόνες σε αυτό.

Υπάρχουν πολλοί τρόποι για να μαζέψεις πόντους ενώ ταυτόχρονα προσπαθείς να ταιριάξεις και τα χρώματα στις κάρτες σου για να πάρεις δώρο gems και πόντους. Να σημειώσω όμως πως το παιχνίδι δεν βγάζει κάποιο theme. Όλο αυτό το σκηνικό με τα χρώματα και τις πυραμίδες είναι αρκετά abstract. Το artwork προσπαθεί να κρύψει την έλλειψη θέματος. :ninja:

Εκτός από τις κάρτες χαρακτήρων υπάρχουν και οι κάρτες με τα νομοσχέδια. Αυτές τις κάρτες τις τραβάμε τυχαία και κυμαίνονται από πολύ δυνατές μέχρι ουσιαστικά αδιάφορες. Υπάρχει μεγάλη διακύμανση εδώ, κάτι που δεν μου άρεσε καθώς προσθέτει μεγάλο randomness σε ένα κατά τα άλλα σφιχτό παιχνίδι. Το να μην είναι οι χαρακτήρες balanced δεν με ενοχλεί καθώς τους παίρνεις με πλειστηριασμό, αλλά τα νομοσχέδια τα τραβάς τυχαία. :shake:

Παρόλα αυτά το παιχνίδι είναι ικανοποιητικό καθώς έχεις αρκετές επιλογές και πράγματα να δοκιμάσεις, ενώ η χρονική του διάρκεια είναι πολύ λογική γύρω στην μια ώρα.  Ικανοποιητική είναι επίσης και η ποιότητα παραγωγής, δεν είχαμε κανένα πρόβλημα.

Mechanically simple game that can be learned in a few minutes. The theme is pretty weak and fades away after the first turn or two as you just start looking for symbols; it really could have been anything. That said, the game itself is pretty challenging as you try to figure out what your strategy is, what colour gems you have left, what colour gems you need, what cards are available, what colours those need, and where they can go in your pyramid. Really enjoying this one and am glad we were able to snag a copy. Unfortunately there is zero player interaction unless players bid for the same colour; really is multiplayer solitaire.

Just one of those games whose mechanics had me smitten after my first play, in which I did pretty badly but learned the ropes. Beautiful artwork, and a nice card stacking mechanic where you are building an empire of various characters and situation cards but also going for points from combos of colors and such that are on those cards. The bidding keeps it tense. I do wish the retail version came with the custom mousepad board, but it seems us non-Kickstarter gamers are destined to suffer forever.

Played the kickstarter version with the upgraded gem components. Colorful, nice artwork and quite a good flow to it. The main mechanisms being auction, which is one of my least favorite ones, automatically brings it down a bit. You definitely need a couple of runthroughs to see all the cards and grasp what a good strategy might be for you in the game. It seemed to drag on somewhat for what it is, but nevertheless I had an ok time playing this. Wouldn't buy it myself, but I can see the appeal it has on some people.

A perfectly well produced bore.  The game is rote multi-player solitaire (and I love Euros).  I'm sure there is more depth after more plays and improved familiarity with the cards but there is nothing about the game that makes me want to plumb the depths (or even try it again).  Too many better and more interesting games in the tableau-building or Euro style.

Interesting game, perhaps with rather too many ways to score than really make sense for what is supposed to be a 45 minute game. It certainly wasn't clear to me on first play what strategy to employ other than "get lots of something" and I have no idea why I won as opposed to anybody else. Will need a few plays to really get to understand all of the scoring opportunities.

Un juego muy bien balanceado. De momento lo he jugado de a 2 y 4 personas y escala bien. La cantidad de opciones para optimizar la pirámide que uno va construyendo hace que se pueda pensar en diferentes estrategias.

Játék:
Vegyes érzelmeim vannak a játékkal kapcsolatban, de elsőre tetszett. Érdekes egy megoldás, bár a titkos licit egy kicsit zavaró és túl nagy szerencsefaktort ad egy ilyen játékhoz, mely miatt lemaradhat egy két játékos akaratlanul azért, mert kártya nélkül kerül ki a körből. Bár tény, hogy van esély korrigálni. Ami nem tetszik, hogy nincs eléggé kiegyensúlyozva a játék néhány kártya miatt, ezért azokat érdemes kivenni. Nem tetszik hogy igazából csak egy féle nyerési útvonal van azaz van egy túl domináns rész, bár ezen belül azért van mozgástér. Kár, hogy csak 4 személyes, mert elfért volna benne egy ötödik játékos, mely nagyobb harcot eredményezhetett volna a licit során

This game looked great in the Rahdo review. I think Allison would really like it. Hopefully an English version shows up soon. Update: Just backed it on Kickstarter with the limited edition cover. Expected in March 2015.

Update 2: This game fell totally flat for us. The tableau building is a fun puzzle, but the “auction” mechanic each round really feels clunky and almost broken. The bidding rules make the game drag, are no fun, and can result in totally unintentional loss of gems without a lot of table talk. I can understand that the designers were going for a bluffing mechanic here, but in practice this doesn’t work at all in a game of this weight. This is evidenced by the large number of posts in the BGG forums with players trying to fix the auctions. I think it would have been a much better game with an Among the Stars style card draft, or a Through the Ages scrolling card row where players must pay more for new cards that come out. Overall a bad kickstarter purchase and a game I don’t ever see myself playing again.

I get the comparison with Splendor as there's the decision whether to use your turn for income or for buying cards. There's a lot more going on though, as there's a blind bidding mechanic instead of buying cards. Cards you get are built in a pyramid and where you place them determines which effects you get to use on the card. Then there's colored corners you wish to match, special tokens for various forms of set collection and special 'law' cards that introduce all kinds of bonusses.

There's some luck involved and when you want to play optimally you have to know in advance which effects are present in the game. To make eductated gambles it pays off to guess what your opponent will go for. If everyone plays that way, there's bound to be a fair amount of AP. Maybe more than this game warrants.

Yes, it's beefier than Splendor, but also takes three times the play time.

Bit torn on this one, I like the pyramid building/resource gathering, where to put your cards optimisation puzzle bit of the game, but I'm less sold on the auction.

It depends on the players ... if the players are prepared to negotiate and honor deals then it works "we both want the blue card this turn, ok how about you get it and then next time we clash I'll get it?", if they don't then it turns into an unpleasant blind bid (where you lose the bid regardless) where you hope you don't match your opponents.

So in summary, happy to play with players prepared to negotiate, not so keen when they don't.

A really neat point salad card game where players are trying to win cards via a simple auction that both fit well into their play area while advancing toward point scoring opportunities.

Cards must be played to your play area in a pyramid. The higher you place a card in your pyramid, the more it costs, but also likely the better its ability would be. Cards can do all sorts of things from getting you more gems (which you need to buy and place more cards), to drawing more cards, to gaining you various chits that are worth points in different ways.

My main gripe is with the auction mechanism, which is a bit of a crap shoot. The other is with some of the cards which are incredibly unbalanced and some times gotten via random draw. So, someone gets a card with 6 points max, and someone else gets a card easily worth 20.  However, overall, I still have fun playing!

Nice game that will likely increase in ranking over additional plays. We mainly play 2 players and we are not super fond of the auction. When not in the mood for the auction, we will try the following 2 variants:
- uncover 2 or 3 cards of each color at once. The further back the card, the more expensive (1/2/3 gems). Selection happens according to play order (first player). Cheapest row is discarded and new cards are uncovered.
- do an among the stars style draft and pay one of the top two gems as cost for the card.

Update February 2016. Seems like a couple of important changes have been made to the rules since I initially played it 2y ago, which improved the game. However the bidding mechanisms still feels tucked on.
---

Splendor on steroids. I am unsure whether I like the blind bidding. I do like, however the card and gem scarcity and probably need to game it to get ahead. There is a strange rhythm, where up front you rush to create a resource base, and then slow down to best use your limited cards and gems. I like that, however, I am unsure whether this is a great game as opposed to just a good one. Need to play more.

This game has hit the table about 10 times in my home and it is always well received. There are so many paths to victory and ways you can play your characters, that you never look at a single component the same way. It reminds me of a cross between Renaissance Man in terms of building a pyramid of power while aligning matching symbols and 7 Wonders in terms of how open it is for players to choose how they want to attain victory. However, the most memorable thing about the game is its breath-taking artwork! Holy cow! Each of the 64 (68 if you backed it on Kickstarter) characters is painstakingly detailed and every game played is a work of art. 

That said, there are only a couple minor things that make this a 4-star for me. The cards are a little flimsy, so I would strongly recommend purchasing a couple packets of card sleeves https://maydaygames.com/card-sleeves/by/viceroy.html and spring for the premium ones. They're quite nice :) Though Viceroy sports unparalleled artwork, it's not very strong as far as theme. 

Neither of these things negatively affects gameplay, though!!! A MUST HAVE for any board game collection that's fun for hardcore and casual gamers!

Nothing ruins the fun of a new game faster than rules that aren't clear. And this game had one of the more frustrating rulesets I've experienced in awhile. The other annoying challenge is the rules don't really tell you that the concept of forming a complete colored circle with your cards shouldn't be a primary aim for you as the game goes on! It's so big and bright on the cards, but it's a losing strategy. Lastly - the game is just overly complicated. 3 rounds of auctions followed by 3 rounds of playing cards for 12 turns? Cut that down to 1 of each and this might make more sense and the advertised playtime would be accurate.

Now that I at least understand there's a slim chance I'd play it again, but on the whole I'd rather not and won't be adding this to my collection.

Components: Gorgeous artwork on the character cards. Boring design on the law cards, which stick out when among my pyramid. Good iconography, except for the bonus tile that scores for colored circles.

Many production elements are problematic. The iconography for levels 1-4 are clear; level 5 is absent from the card entirely, as if it were some variant afterthought snuck into the rules just before production when it was too late to update the cards. The player screens have an icon glossary, but don't remind players of the different ways to score points, or that a player gets 3 gemstones when passing during an auction, or that there are a maximum three rounds to auctions and development phases. Why are the circles off-center on the bases of the character cards? Why do the rules instruct me to place tokens on the cards in my pyramid, when it doesn't matter where in my pyramid those tokens are (except infinite gemstones), and it makes it more difficult to count/consider them? Why do the rules instruct me to score completed circles and infinite gemstones separately, when they are scored identically? Finally, the box could have been half the size.

Experience: The character cards are interesting; I like that each is roughly as good as each other, but that they have different values at different times. Yet their more expensive higher levels are not necessarily better than their cheaper lower levels, and so often I get only a level 1 effect for placing a card at level 3. Although the characters are cool, I have no idea why they are being stacked in a pyramid; didn't get any sense of theme.

Matching the colored circles is way harder than I thought it would be, and doesn't seem to add much to the game (it's way easier to just acquire gemstones and 'paint' circles at the end). The idea of 'painting' unmatching circles feels like an afterthought.

The punishment for tying in an auction seems too swingy for anything but a two-player game. It's fairly easy to hoard a gemstone color; not sure why these need to be finite, other than to make it possible to screw another player. This is especially true in a 2-player game, when I could count the public gemstones and figure out whether my opponent was lacking a particular color.

The law cards help give players some different directions to take, as do the bonus tiles, so that player strategies diverge. but they aren't well integrated into the pyramid visually.

Overall, feels very rough. I like the central mechanism of cards that offer different effects at different levels, but it's not really working for me here.

I have enjoyed some plays of this game.  However, I think the game is broken.  If one player gains multiple infinite gem at the start of the game by luck (starting cards), they have a significant advantage.  Further, they can then hoard all the gems of the color of their infinite gem and never play that color gem again.  All other players can never build a card that needs that color gem.  Even if the other player later obtains a card that has an infinite gem of the hoarded color, they cannot build it because it requires the hoarded color in order to build it. When the above strategy was employed in a game within the first 10 minutes, it made the rest of the game painful.  Maybe this could be mitigated by allowing a 3 to 1 substitution for any color when building a card (not bidding).  Also, see forum post titled "A game designers view of Viceroy - it could have been great" for more ideas on house rules that may help the game.

It was actually quite fun too trying to find and get the best cards for your pyramid and how to manage your gems to play the your cards in the right spot and get the right bonuses. It seems replay value for this games is really high. I've tried it only with two players and I think it's going to be even better with 3 or four, just because of the auctions, it seemed in a two player game, you got the cards you wanted quite easily. Overall it's a good game.

Un jeu pour le gamer qui sommeille en vous pour terminer. Viceroy est un jeu russe qui a été financé via Kickstarter il y a déjà quelques mois (C'est vrai que les ilustrations font très personnages fantastiques des contrées froides de l'europe de l'est). C'est de la gestion de ressources et de l'enchère. Il va falloir recuperer à chaque tour des personnages pour en faire une pyramide. Chaque perso vous donnera des avantages. Un jeu sympa mais attention au matos qui est (il paraît) un peu cheap et s'use rapidement.

A nice concept but there are so many other points salads out there with what I feel are much 'cleaner designs' that I can't see this hitting the table within any of my game groups again.
I liked the concept of pyramid building - production quality though was so-so in parts and universally all the players thought the bidding system was just not bringing anything to the table.
Was also worried about balance of law cards and that there was one that simply didn't fit in with the remainder (and some that are clearly stronger than others with no compensation).
It just felt like a prototype - then so did a few of Alan Moon's early games :-)

This one could rank much better, with just some changes.

The art design of the tiles is very nice, as also are the ideias of buiding your kingdom/society around a pyramid of tiles (set collection) and the fact that each tile activates a specific feature, according to the pyramid level where it is placed (hand management).
But the game also includes a somewhat dull system of auction to obtain the tiles, there seems to be some imbalance in those "infinit gems" and new players might be taken completely by surprise by some nuances of the scoring system.

Multiple set and sets-within-sets options combined with card placement limitations and a little resource management add tension to this set collecting game.

Just one play but seemed to enjoy it.  I'm not sure I like the blind bidding for cards though.  Most of the time we came to an arrangement on who gets what.   But when agreements could not be hashed out, it was a bit of brinkmanship.  You always hope to get what you want, while multiple others refuse to give in....not getting cards in the process.  At the same time, it is usually pointless to bicker over a card as it sets you back relative to others not fighting for cards.  That said, I tried to chime in early what I was going for..display my gem...and stick to the plan.   The overall strategy seemed a little cookie cutter to me.   Early on, establish income via gems or infinite-gems, get cards where possible....convert to points later in the game.  Still, it was a fun playing so will leave at 7 for now.

This is well designed game, but it is not for me. It's a very stressful game with a lot of chaos that starts off chill, burn things escalate quickly as you attempt to build your pyramid of power.

A pyramid building game which made me think a little bit of Renaissance Man.   The character art is great, although it's kind of a waste as none of the cards have thematic abilities.   The cards are quite thin which allows Mayday to sell you some thin sleeves too.   There is a lot to puzzle out in terms of timing and placement of your cards and more than enough variety to keep it interesting for a while.   It plays fine and provides a nice challenge.   My biggest issue is that it is somewhat repetitive and will need to be played quickly (which should be do-able).  Overall, better than I expected.

Finally got Viceroy played after a year and a half of sitting on my shelf.  I thankfully have the experience of all those who came before me and pulled out the game-breaking cards, so we didn't run into any issues.

This is a fun game.  On paper, it sounds drier than Nevada, but in practice there's quite a bit of strategy mashed together with the luck of the draw.  While my opponents always had a hand of cards, I got myself to a point of "win an auction or do nothing at all" and the gemstones were not easy to get a hold of.  Granted, lots of cards could make you gemstone rich, but I pursued a strategy of collecting magic - not something I wanted to do, but something my first two cards demanded - and ended out on top by just a few points (I was sorely lacking in shields).

I knock off half a point because for such a relatively quick and simple auction and development game, the set-up feels a little too fiddly.  Also, the penny sleeves I got as a backer are insulting - those will be removed for next plays.

2015-10-27 : Engine building game with a spatial element and many possible combos. Very good layout and graphics ensure smooth gameplay that keeps everyone involved and has just the right amount of turns. You can feel this KS, unlike most of them, was actually playtested and fine-tuned. The only real problem we've encountered was the starting cards you got and where one player got hosed right from the start - next time we'll try a draft system. Initial rating is 6, but this will in all likelihood go up to 8 on subsequent plays.

This is a decent tableau building card game. I don't think this should be considered an auction game/blind-bidding game as I initially thought it was. It seems to be more of a negotiation game during the auction phase since people can and do openly discuss where you're placing your bid so resources are not wasted. Most of the powers are just scoring mechanisms (which isn't always bad... because euro games?) or resources. This is ok, I guess, but I'm used to more interesting powers in my tableau card games. My first game played fairly long (like 90 - 100 mins) which seemed really weird because there didn't seem to be much AP/downtime. On the plus side, it certainly didn't feel that long. The game allows you to play 3 cards per round in the 12 round game. You won't be playing that many because you usually only acquire 1 card per round. The purpose is so you can collect cards and optimally build them in your pyramid, but I didn't know this on the first play. 

When players draw cards from their card abilities, they take a law card or a character card. The character cards are in a small stack separate from the character stack that gets added to the auctions. It was weird to run out of the small stack of character cards. I think this would happen every game. I'm sure it's intended but I found it to be a bit disappointing. In reality the small deck is fine, because you still have the Law Cards. With how tight gems eventually become, you're likely to want to place free Law cards anyway. It just seemed strange to me that there were so few character cards outside of the auctions. A point of caution is that this game takes up MAJOR real estate on your table. Ie: I could fit 4 players uncomfortably around Arkham Horror, but I'm not sure I could do so with Viceroy without side tables for tokens. Another point of caustion is that some of these cards were made by mayday and not the designers. The characters seem fine, but some of the Law cards are way OP. This game also breaks one of my cardinal sins of games: cards with exactly the same effect, with different names. I guess, the gem colours might be different despite having the same card effect, but bleh.

I think future plays could get faster. I also think I would like better because I definitely had misconceptions going into the game. That said, playing Ra immediately afterwards, made me put Viceroy on the sell pile. Despite Ra being a game of acquiring tiles with scoring mechanisms, the auction and push-your-luck, just makes it so much more of a lively game.

Rated after 1, very boring, play. The good thing: beautiful artwork. For everything else the game fell flat for me. The bidding mechanic is ok I guess. Building the tableau was just plain boring, no interesting choices, and completely unexciting effects imo. 

Auction a card, pay gem, play it, pay gems, get gems.
Auction a card, pay gem, play it, draw a card.
Auction a card, pay gem, play it, gain an infinite gem.
...

After 5 rounds I was fed up with it.

Add that to the fact, that the game is actually quite luck dependent. I got a law card that let me remove cards from my hand for 3 points each, however, except for level 4 of the pyramid, you'll never get ahead in cards, and you'll play a maximum of 3 lvl four cards in the whole game I guess? Anyway, that card is much, much worse than other law cards I get the feeling, and as you randomly draw them... Same goes for the other cards. If you get the right bonus cards, cool, if not, tough luck. Ok for a 30 min. max game, to much for me for everything 30+ min. 

I guess I will give it one more try probably at one point and then, most probably, will never look at it again.

Game consumes a ton of table space with two, I can't imagine how much space you need with four.

Building the pyramid is satisfying when completing sets and rewarding at the end when tallying points.

The mat is worth the investment, and it fits in the box.  (Gems upgrade not as important - in fact, we prefer the std ones because they're stackable and easier to sort - but it's nice that Mayday makes so many options available.)

Abstract.

With two players, we tried a variant:  if the bid is for the same color, one player wins it on even rounds, and the other on odd rounds.  (Having now read some of the discussions, have to consider whether the losing gem bid is lost - and how much negotiation may occur.)  We played too nicely and as a result the bidding round lost some engagement.

I kickstarted this game. The campaign left me a bit sour to the company, however the game is fantastic. A nice take on set collection and drafting that is not just collating a hand of numbered cards. Only played at the full player count once and would like to do so again as I don't think the group was right for it- that game was a bit slow, however it was a teaching game. I think repeat plays would be very interesting.

A card drafting and placement game with hand management and auction elements that allow you to build up a little city, composed of characters and laws, in the form of a pyramid in front of you. We've been playing a character pyramid building game – The Kingdom of Influences – for a few years now that we love and this one felt similar. The game is very beautiful, if somewhat busy due to the garish colouring; and the rules are very clear and detailed to the point of being repetitive where it says the same thing multiple times in different sections. The game is easy to learn without all the superfluous information and the rules could be cut in half. 

In general we liked it quite a bit – the spatial puzzle of where to place your cards in the pyramid, the various laws you could use to change things up, qualify for end game bonuses, gain gemstones etc., the variety of the cards provided, and just the way the entire thing came together. There was also that sweet tension of 1. wanting to buy a card at auction with a particular gemstone but yet needing that colour to be able to build it, 2. needing to place a character on the lower pyramid levels but also wanting to wait to place him higher up to get mega benefits...aaargh! The auction/blind bidding is OK – nothing special, but not particularly onerous. There are very few ways to get cards in the game. It's either by auction or as a reward of placing a character or law. This can limit your options somewhat as you can't really refresh your hand too much. In that aspect it reminds me of Seasons, as well as the combinations you can make and set yourself up for. The 'negotiation' or whatever seems silly at 2...or in general really but I haven't played it with more so I don't know for sure. We just bid what we wanted to bid, a couple times we lost our gems, but usually when we had a clash of the same colour and 2 cards it just so happened we were going for different characters anyway so it worked out alright.

We've played it a few times, and we definitely thought it was a good game. I always had a good time while playing, (and I've always won!) but when it comes to picking it off the shelf I tended to want to choose something else. I'd be happy enough to play it again in the future if the opportunity ever presented itself, but nothing really stands out as particularly special to me and compared to a combo-tastic game like Seasons it just wouldn't get played.

The pyramid-shaped tableau-building is a welcome challenge. Figuring out how to get the teir of benefits you actually want to pay for with each character wracks my brain in s fun way. The bidding is set up to create some good tension between players, too.

A really nice game with a lot of planning, thinking ahead and meaningful decisions. Also I like how you always are short of something: either cards, or gems, or tokens, or a foundation in your pyramid.

Une structure de richesses proche de Spelndor avec des vrais objectifs. Pas mal de mechaniques interessantes.

Kicsit fura a licitálós mechanizmus, de nagyon jó a piramisépítős rész. Eléggé szoliter. Sok helyre figyelős, kombózós.

Féltem tőle, hogy a fura licit négyen nem fog működni, de tévedtem. Kicsit izgalmasabb lett természetesen, de nem akadt be reménytelenül, szóval teljesen jó volt. Az a házi szabály is életképes, hogy az első körben nincs megbeszélés, de utána már lehet, azoknak akik összeakadtak.
Elég jól balanszoltnak tűnik a játék, tök más irányokból is hasonló pontokat lehet szerezni. Különböző játékosszámmal máshová kerülnek a hangsúlyok, ami szintén nem baj.
Két dolog zavar csak benne: a törvénykártyák közt nagyon nagy a különbség, illetve, hogy iszonyat szoliter a játék. A liciten kívül nem nagyon lehet figyelni a többiekre.

Viceroy is certainly an interesting game.  There are a lot of different scoring systems going on, almost like 7 Wonders in that way.  Each scoring system is simple to understand, so it isn't a brain burner figuring them all out at once. But the real effort comes in on what to focus on and looking out for the cards that you need.  However, things can get very chaotic with all the blind bidding, "pyramid" placement system, "infinity" jewels and jewel puzzles (which have no thematic basis and feel like one-too-many mechanics on an already bloated game). It works, but at least for the first couple of games you are going to just play through and see how it works. Probably after several plays you can begin to focus on what you want to focus on. It is a game that leaves you thinking about how to do better the second time, so there is merit to its design. Again, a bit of an overloaded and inelegant game but there's something quite decent about it.

If you love Splendor, you should play this one next.  Building a pyramid, gathering the abilities that the card provides for the level of pyramid you placed the card in. Match the colors of the cards to the others around in and gain gems of that color.  All the money (bidding and card activation) is in these color gems.  Point salad.  Fun light-middle to middle weight card game.

Played this with 4p and removed the imbalanced cards before hand.

I enjoyed the pyramid building aspect of this game but greatly disliked the auction side. It felt like forced attempt at adding player interaction. But because of the added negotiation bidding style and how tight the gems are already, this really soured the game for me. 4p can be a cluster F and sometimes you just randomly get screwed. They should have refunded the gems or something at least

I think if the game just focused on the puzzle element of the pyramid and just did a turn order picking of the cards (or anything else really), I would have greatly enjoyed the game.

I saw many reviews at 2p, the game seemed decent then because the auction side was more marginizied and there is more of a NET gain aspect. Solitaire-ish but I think that's ok

I wanted to try the game at 3p because I think that's the multiplayer sweet spot but I never got it to the table again to try before selling it. I will give this game a bump since I didn't get to try it at 3 and I think the interesting elements would have been more manageable at that count

First, the artwork is great.  Components are good except the cards are woefully thin.  

There are several ways to score points and divergent strategies are likely, which is nice.  You first are building your "engine" then in the latter half of the game you are concentrating on vp's.  Each of the different ways you score points becomes another puzzle for you to solve while you do your own thing.  That is nice for our style of play where the only interaction is the competition for cards(and swords/shields at the end). 

Enjoyable and fun to progress and ending is climatic.  Nice tension as scoring is not really known until it is tallied.  Overall a good game minus the sadly thin cards. I love that everything has a thick layer of linen on it, but these cards.. whatever they saved wasn't worth it because this is a good game.

A surprisingly quick game, with only 12 turns that flies by, because there is simultaneous building and bidding. There was certainly a lot of finesse to get the points and for our first game, the player using the scrolls and multiplier strategy streaked ahead. But I can see that each game is going to be different depending on how the cards come out. Good game, really liked it more than I expected I would.

"Bidding" is awkward. The thing with cards having totally different values depending where you build them in your pyramid is interesting, though. Even more so when you realize that there's tension between waiting to build things (so you can sequence them perfectly and make one-color circles) and building them right away (to max out the value of infinite gemstones-- though admittedly, that might be the only reason).

Fine game, but it's pretty much solitaire, even though there is a "bidding" phase in this game. The bidding however is not exiting at all since no one can afford a high price especially not since there are so many other options available all the time.

It's a straight game, too. You just go for points in one way or another and get some gems when needed. There's no real combo stuff that would allow for some fancy plays.

Nothing wrong with the game, but I don't need another multiplayer solitaire game.

Although the artwork & components are top notch, the game really sucks.
First of all, the bidding is hidden but you could talk about it.. and why shouldn't you? Because if two of you bid on the same thing, you both loose a valuable gem & have to bid again.. that mechanic feels really strange..

For the rest of the game, you're building your little pyramid of matching colour (more VPs) & try to combo effects.. If you're a hard core euro gamer you might enjoy this..
Theme..? No. Why are we placing these guys on top of each other..? And why do they have different colours? We'll never know.

At least everyone plays at the same time, so no downtime..

IMO, A much more advanced Splendor. Yes, it is mechanically different and has no theme, but it is the thinkier, meatier engine builder game that Splendor is. It can be fiddly with all the bits and can cause moments of AP, but if you get the scoring down and plan ahead, you will love Viceroy. Sadly only played solo, and really enjoyed my time with it, but another game that I could not get to the table. Hate culling my collection, but sometimes you have to make room for games that will hit the table. Thankfully Viceroy isn't an overly expensive game, and will gladly re-purchase again

An abstract bidding and resource management game, there really isn't a theme here in spite of the elaborate card art. Some frustration and luck in the bidding (if your bid coincides with another player, you both lose your bid, but gain nothing), but well enough done if you can internalise the multi-factor scoring mechanism.

Received via October 2016 Math Trade! Almost backed this originally on Kickstarter and am really happy I've been able to get my hands on it.

The game Splendor wishes it could be.  This is a terrific Tableau building game with  a simple and engaging auction mechanic.  Building the pyramid while connecting colored circles is satisfyingly puzzley,  and the multiple routes to victory give it a lot more staying power than Splendor. I feel this is a much more crunchy and deeper engine builder than  Splendor was while still remaining light enough on rules to be a gateway. And the art is amazing!

On the surface, this game is many things that make me hot and bothered--an aesthetically-pleasing worker placement and resource management euro that forces tough decisions. Viceroy takes it a step further and adds competitive bidding, and occasionally forces the blissfully frustrating move of stealing something from someone that does not really help you, if anyone is interested in preventing a steamrolling. And some of the subtle "take thats," love 'em.

But the bad...holy doge the balance on some of those law cards is game-breakingly awful. Hmmm...3 extra VP per set, or 1 VP for EVERY card in your pyramid? Give me a freaking break! I expect some cards to be better than others, but just...wow. Love the game in general, but we may need to bust out a sharpie for a few of those cards...

Fun game, kind of reminds me of seven wonders but with a sort of auction instead of card drafting. One thing I didn't like was that from what I could tell there's exactly one attack card in the game (one of the laws lets you switch a token on one of your cards with one on an opponent's) and it can be absolutely devastating, especially not knowing it existed. If there were a lot of aggressive cards like that it'd be one thing, but to be playing a largely solitaire game and then as the last move before final scoring getting a critical token taken away (I lost a token worth 25 pts to me and got a token worth 2...) it was pretty devastating and almost soured me to the whole experience. If I bought the game I'd probably just burn the card though and be left with a fun light low interaction filler with a decent amount of space for strategic decisions.

Late, poor production value, great game. 

It's unfortunate that MayDay got the English rights to this game, the production values are quite low, and there are misprints, bad graphic design choices, a terrible rulebook, etc... 

But the gameplay itself is quite engaging and fun. 

The rulebook is a mess. So many words to convey such simple mechanisms and streamlined gameplay. The rulebook gets you lost in a maze of ten foot tall walls of repetitive and poorly written text, making rules reference frustrating at best and head meet table at worst.

I'm glad I own a copy of this game, for the game, but man do I wish someone else had published this stateside.

I've only played this a couple of times, but I'm really enjoying this game. The card drafting isn't particularly interactive in a 2 player game (though clashes do happen), but deciding what card you want and how you're going to layout your pyramid makes for some really interesting decisions.

I am completely biased, but the facts that the game is co-published by Mayday and that it is associated with Kickstarter make me biased against the game before even taking game play into consideration.

But ultimately it is the theme and the artwork that cement my already unfair opinion. This is a very abstract game, and the puzzle aspect is kind of fun. There are definitely decisions to be made. But the whole European nobility thing feels so old, so overused, so boring. And this sounds even more unfair, but IMO it is even worse when non-German games adopt this theming. When Japanese games do it, or here, Russian games, even though this is an unfair conclusion, I perceive the game as devoid of originality. The artwork is also incredibly ugly. With another theme and with less garish artwork (which is difficult to change given the theme) I could probably rate this a 7. But even now, a 5 seems generous.

Wish the cards were thicker, so that when laid out in the cool, colorful pyramid, they'd sit next to one another better. Auction mechanism is odd: players basically have to agree on who will bid on which color, or they endure mutually assured destruction of multiple bids on the same card, which costs precious gems and kills your ability to do anything that round.

Viceroy is an abstract with good art, but to be honest I have only glanced at the art.
If you are looking for theme you won't find it here.

What you get is a resource management game in which you basicly try to build a pyramid shaped structure. 
The rules are easy, the symbols are pretty clear. They sort of made this with colourblind people in mind with some small alterations to the rings.

To me this replaces splendor.
And because of that I downgrade that to a six.  It was 8 original but after ten plays I downgraded that to a 7 and never looked at splendor again.
At this time I would much rather play Viceroy and I want to give splendor another shot to see if it is different enough to keep its place in my collection.

Edit:
After a couple of more plays there is definately luck of the draw with the law cards.
Infact this will most likely decide the outcome of the game.

However trying to get the most of it with the cards you blind draw .... Well I like that a lot.

Viceroy is a board game of bidding and resource management set in the fantasy universe of the famous Russian CCG Berserk. As the players struggle for control over the world of Laar, they recruit a variety of allies and enact various laws. These cards allow players to develop their state's military and magical might, increase their authority, and get precious gems they need to continue expanding their nation.

As the game progresses, each player builds his own power pyramid using character and law cards. Each card has its own effect that depends on the level of the pyramid where the card is played. These effects may give more resources, more cards, or victory points. The player who has the most power points at the end of the game becomes the ruler of entire Laar and the winner!

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
[2015 Jul 23] Some potentially interesting positioning mechanisms & costing schedule are severely outweighed by unnecessary blind bidding and other random elements making this game a bust. The blind bidding mechanism punishes those players who inadvertently choose to bid on the same item (thus forcing a re-bid at a worse rate); players who blind bid unopposed, buy their items "on-the-cheap". Additionally, the cards have varying degrees of applicability to players' games; a player who lucks into a string of synergistic cards will fare better than those whose cards are not synergistic. Unfortunately, this game spears to suffer from underdevelopment. It should not have been Kickstarted, but instead non-started. But, hey, that's my opinion... your mileage may vary.

Dropped its rating a point. I still enjoy playing, but the last few plays have felt a bit samey. 

FIRST IMPRESSIONS:

Really enjoyed my first play and look forward to more plays. Knowledge of the cards and techs will be helpful just for knowing what can/might happen. Focus on building up resources first before thinking about points too much. Do not play with promo Viceroy cards and there is one other card that might be promo or original that is nasty take that and is the only card in the game like that making it ridiculously OP and I've taken it out of the deck of law cards. Law cards are free to play while character cards cost gems to play and have generally more powerful actions the higher one places them in your pyramid. Build a fifth level card and you can either take 15 points or take the first three actions on the card which can be very powerful.  Colors are bold and I like the art. 

* I recommend taking out Barter and Referendum law cards - at least initially.

Viceroy occupies an interesting design space within boardgames. In Viceroy you bid on characters that you can add to your tableau that will give you a benefit depending on what level you place them. The bidding mechanic is unique. Each player bids a specific type of jewel for the card they wish to acquire.  If two players bid the same thing with the same type of crystal they have to rebid, but if no one else bid with that type of crystal then the player gets the card and adds it to their tableau. The game works, it has some interesting choices, the components are okay, but the game didn't really hold my interest all that much. Halfway through the game I was wondering when the game would be over.

Viceroy is an entertaining game. Each round starts with a clever not-your-typical-auction phase that promotes table talk and discussions to hopefully ensure one doesn't needlessly overspend for cards (though verbal agreements can be broken to throw a wrench into plans). Then the game continues with a card pyramid building phase that provides a puzzle of sorts to figure out how best to play the cards you've won at auction. Cards provide a wealth of benefits depending on when and how they are placed into the pyramid. There are also resources to manage throughout the game that require effort to obtain at times. The game looks great on the table with spectacular card artwork and colorful components.

A auction and "pyramid" building game where you are acquiring cards via auction in one part of the game and then playing them to a "pyramid" structure and trying to link up gems to get you gems in the game.  There are number of ways to score at the end.

Not my favourite game, although I don't have any specific complaints about it. Mixes:
- blind auction for cards, in an "Edel Stein und Reich" style
- tableau building, with cards having a different cost and bringing different bonuses depending on their place in the pyramid-shaped tableau; and extra bonuses for colour-matching of adjacent cards

The steampunk theme looks cool, but doesn't really play any role.

A point salad engine building game with far too many rules and mechanics to keep track of.  It does require you to know the cards inside and out to play well.  My main issue with the game is there are too many things to keep track.  While there is some player interaction, it is very limited and mostly ignored.

Traded it away.  They are far more interesting and less rule intensive engine builders out there.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I feel like this could be streamlined quite a bit.  The rulebook recommends a strategy of NOT building your pyramid until the second half of the game.  In my mind (and in my experience) that means you have many turns where you pass on the auction just to get more gems.  And then you pass on development of your pyramid because you want to get a better hand of cards (which you didn't get in auction because you passed to get gems).

In the end, I was unfulfilled and felt like half of the game was a tedious slog (or a drawn out discussion on what everyone wanted to bid for), and the other half of the game was an interesting puzzle.  If the game was only that second half, without the frustrating and boring first half, I'd enjoy it a lot more.

Wow! What a surprise. This game came out of nowhere and I love it! It takes a couple of plays to wrap your head around the scoring, but once you have it, it's a load of fun and quite diverse.

Too many heavily imbalanced cards. -1 point.

Excellent game! It looks complicated at first but plays quite easy. The only complicated thing about it is deciding what way to score points. In a way you're plotting moves ahead of time like chess which your plans will alter with every card auctioned off. The artwork is beautiful and unique to each character card. High quality all around. Great game for a great value! Cheers to everyone behind this game!

Pyramid scoring structure is pretty fantastic, but I dislike all the ways you actually receive cards: the bidding feels very random/dependent on knowing other people's preferences of play, and the law cards(a large source of points/combo ability) are handed out completely randomly. But the law cards clearly have a wide variance in power, including a few that are just objectively better than others.

Overall a disappointing experience. I wish the publisher had done better polishing on this one, the underlying scoring system is really neat.

Well about the game, I liked it, but it was not a blast, just another decent game, that is good adition to any collection.

Pros.
Amazing auction system;
Several interesting strategies to ghater points for your "point salads";
Strong replayability;
Feels balanced enough;
Really minimal downtime;

Cons.
Small icons, bussy cards, that makes it hard to read from them;
Law cards feel unnecessary strong (but you can play without them)
It is hard to connect game with theme. When I teach the game, I usually tell story, that you are in some country after civil var and now you are fighthing for political power. In order to gain such power you need to recruit several individuals with different set of skils.(This background helps, but soon after few rounds all that really mater are those small icons which you need to get in order to run your engine.

In the end this is good game, and all that I have played it with seems to really enjoy the game.

Blind bidding for cards, that is the big minus for me. And paying your bid, even if you don't gain anything with it yet. That takes away a lot of strategy. 
After the auction you can start building your pyramide of cards. The higher you build the card, the better the rewards generally. Not bad, it all works. You can create yourself several multiplier points engines, quite nice. Although except for the auction there is virtually no interaction.

I'm not a fan of the blind bidding in this game at all it's clunky and it'd be better just taking turns bidding then just upping your bid if needed when it comes back round to you such as in games like Keyflower, Fleet or Biblios.
there is loads to like in this game though, the mechanics are great and i like the choices of where to place cards and the artwork is to be quite honest some of the best i've seen!

This is a really cool game of building up a power pyramid, you bid for cards, play cards to your pyramid to find the best scoring opportunities as well as trying to make complete gem circles of the same colour.

I liked this a lot and look forward to trying it again soon.

Great looking card game where you build a pyramid of cards. There is not much interaction and the game is very puzzely. It is an ok 2 player game, but the auction doesn't really work. It has too little interaction to be played with more than two in my opinion. Had fun with it for a few games and then sold it.

Decent enough game, fun, with fun abilities and a tight economy. Nice decisions to be made.

For complication and table space, two players is perfect. For auction three or four players would probably be better

I like how they managed to turn a simple principle "the higher you get, the harder it is to get all corners of matching color" and turned it into a pleasant, simple yet strategic game. Also the illustrations are quite pleasing to the eye.
This is one of the cases of games where, while I don't need them in my collection, I do understand the hype.

Viceroy was designed to be a very tight tableau-building game. It doesn't feel that way at first though. Early on you can really feel your engine ramp up, then all of a sudden the rug gets yanked out from under you, and you're left with a game that moves at a snail's pace. I understand the game was designed this way, but it certainly isn't for me.

RATING: 7
A beautifully produced game (besides the box, which is strangely thin), this game just felt a little too random for me.  The auction phase didn't seem to have a lot to it, and the cards you were bidding on were all so similar (most of the time) that it rarely made a big difference to the end-game score which you got.

Keeping track of other players' pyramids and what they're likely to bid on was all-but-impossible at the max player count, too.

Enjoyable in part, but not good enough to keep alas.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I was down on this game after my first play, but my next play finally invested me in the game.  The decisions are interesting and the bidding mechanic adds just a little bit of negotiation and "chicken."  The game plays quick, under an hour, and escalates nicely as your power pyramid grows.

This is a very solid hand management "Pyramid building" card game with very clever mechanics, offers lots of strategy and replayability, and has stunning artwork. Great great game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Each round, players bid to get 1 card into their hand, then there are 3 development phases to build a pyramid with your cards. Generally, the higher the level of pyramid you achieve, the higher the points you score. The bidding mechanism is different: you can tell your opponents which card you are bidding for (to avoid a collision where both parties lose their 1 token bid) or you can blind bid. 

You score points for having achieved circles, VP bonuses, sets and you lose points when your opponents collect swords. There are a lot of things going on, so it will take a few games to get used to. I've only played once, it's okay, and I would play again.

RATING: 8
Fun and pretty.  Explaining it makes it sound different than how it plays, but that's because the rulebook is not made to be read quickly.

Also, consider removing the kickstarter promo laws (heroes are fine...except for the viceroys) because they are very unbalanced and unfun.  Actually, I don't really like the laws, and I wished the game was heroes-only, but the laws are an important part of it to remove them altogether.

Anyway, fun game.  Good once it gets going but not as good as 7 Wonders, which is similar in the set collection aspect.  However, it plays well with 2 players.

RATING: 6.6
Solid game that might appeal to fans of Splendor. A 2-player will provide a relax experience while a 4-player game will definitely become more cutthroat. There are many nuances and rules/advantages you might forget to keep track of. Therefore, player help cards would have been appreciated, especially for new gamers.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Haha! I wish all Kickstarter Exclusives were this bad. It would keep the aftermarket cost of Kickstarted games down. Card sleeves, some terrible promo cards that the game is better without, and cheap plastic gems better replaced with glass beads? Whoopie. The best Exclusive is the playmat, which is nice, but not really necessary.

Viceroy itself is a themeless game. Each player creates a pyramid of cards, hoping to achieve a layout that will score the most points at game end. As each card has different abilities depending on what layer of the pyramid it is placed, and game end is a victory point salad, analysis paralysis is easily achieve searching for ideal placement.

Viceroy isn't a bad game, but I got it the same day as another tableau builder, Elysium, which I find far more engaging.

RATING: 4
This game is "meh" especially at 2 players. The bidding is barely interesting and at 2 it's almost unnecessary. 

The rest of the game just doesn't seem exciting or tense and the mechanisms are not that innovative.

The art is really nice, but almost too much for the type of game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
The art is good, the cardstock might be a bit flimsy, but it does the trick. Its price is good and the production value is too. 

Of course, the theme is nowhere to be found, because this is all about mechanisms. You bid for cards and you place them to form a pyramid trying to unlock as many combos as possible. And this is what I find most attactive about this game and what sparked my interest in the first place. Each card will have a different ability depending on the row you place it, and it has some colours you will have to match with the neighbouring cards for additional points.

But the part that turns really me down is the constant haggling of the auction. Overspending a few times or not getting any tile in the auction will cost you the game for sure, so you are forced to come to an arrangement.

Combines several smaller mechanics into a very cool game.  Bluffing, bidding, set collection, hand management, and probably a few others I can't think of right now.  All that and it plays in under an hour! Fantastic artwork as well.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The auction scheme is very repetitive, and not very rewarding. As for the card effects, my first playing felt like you have to decide which scoring method to strive for and go all in on that. Might be just my dislike of this kind of combo-building speaking, though. Still, I feel that there is a decent core idea in here and I might be willing to explore further.

The rookie mistakes on production make this a tough sell though. The rulebook, law cards, and scoring summary are all giant walls of text. Icons on character cards are tiny. The lack of player aids combined with a pile of huge blank tokens means constant guesswork on what each token is supposed to be doing.

Delusione, gioco di combo da paura. A fine partita piovono punti a catinelle. Privo di ambientazione (non la si avverte mai) non mi ha per nulla convinto. Il gioco sempre un'arido gioco d'aste (molto fortunose) e impilamento di carte. L'interazione esiste solo a tratti (asta) ma poi ognuno si concentra con la propria costruzione di piramide. Gioco che non mi ha regolato molte soddisfazioni. Molto gradevole la grafica delle carte ma nulla più.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A hugely bizarre mish-mash of concepts with some rather smart art pulling it all together. The points-salad of a final scoring definitely doesn't justify the complexity, but the gameplay is engaging enough with minimal downtime and plenty to consider. There is an entertaining dichotomy between the need for everyone to see all the detail on the cards under bid, but also having a large enough table to lay out the bulky tableaus.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8 -> 6)[/COLOR]

[i]I picked up a copy, but after reading through the rules again I decided to trade my copy away. This was in large part due to the bidding mechanic, I know it wouldn't have gone over well and since I play a lot of new games with my kids and I didn't want to introduce them to a game I didn't think they'd like.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]- Offers a different take on tableau building, you are building a pyramid and the level you build on changes the benefit you gain.
- I only played 2p, but it worked quite well even with the bidding mechanic.
- There seem to be enough variety in the way you can score points to give the game some legs.
- Not sure I'm a fan of the bidding mechanic, I would have preferred a draft. I could see it either bogging down with 4 and/or being extremely frustrating and potentially sucking all the fun out of the game.

I'm really glad I was finally able to play Viceroy after nearly backing it a few years ago. It seems to have fallen from grace with so many copies up for trade/sale and a lot of this seems tied to the bidding mechanic. I can see the potential pitfalls of the bidding mechanic, hopefully I get a chance to play this more and develop a stronger opinion. Bidding mechanic aside, maybe playing it well after the hype died down helped in my case because I really enjoyed my play of Viceroy. I'm looking forward to further plays and I'm considering picking it up to play with my kids.[/i]

I'm going to hold off on rating so I don't sour grapes the ranking.  This one was a hard loss for me -- my wife smoked me pretty soundly.  A lot of that, I feel, was due to her luck in starting cards -- she had me beat out of the starting gate and I couldn't seem to ever catch up.  Now, I may just not grok the game, so we'll see, but I wonder if some drafting at the beginning might not help in those situations where starting cards just don't seem to be nice to some players while being very nice to others.

The concept is the age-old decision on whether to spend resources on buying cards, on building them to your tableau, or passing to get more resources (or buying cards that give you more resources instead of VPs). To this end, the decision making is decent - not only are you trying to develop a VP engine, but you're trying to find cards that match up colour-wise with the other cards in your tableau. But the bidding process seems dangerous to good gaming health. Getting stuck in a bidding war while other players watch you self-destruct isn't a lot of fun, nor is the potential ill-feeling generated by nefarious negotiation ploys (ie straight up lies on what each player is thinking of going for). Blind bidding is not my favourite game mechanic. In the end, the downsides outweighed the upsides for me.

Auction, engine-building game. Resources (money) in this game is very scarce, so strategic auctions and tactical placement of your cards is important to excel. The interesting mechanic is the pyramid-like pattern that your acquired cards form, which can also score points at the end.

I've played this game twice so far, and all I have to say is that if you didn't like the game played out, or the game was low scoring (20-40 points) read the instructions again, you played it wrong!

This game is way more enjoyable once you understand the rules and see how things need to be setup. Think open market 7 wonders, mixed with a deleting economy that anyone can monopolize in.

Viceroy is a nice game where you bid gems to get cards that you add to a pyramid of cards each player builds. The cards have different effects and costs depending on what height they are built. Then there are endgame points for players who were able to match the colors on the orbs at the edges of the cards, and stuff for completing sets. I would definitely play this again, but there wasn't anything about it that makes me want to go buy my own copy.

A solid, entertaining game that does have a few problems which, while not deal breakers, mar what would otherwise be a much more cohesive gaming experience.  
First off, the translation in the rules and the cards can lead to some confusion...nothing that can't be overcome, but the rules (in particular) creates some ambiguities in the flow of the game which skirt perilously close to requiring house rules (for example...when players pass in the development phase, do they draw their gems first).
Second, there are a number of "law cards" (cards which grant powers and ways to earn VP's at the end of the game) which are VASTLY overpowered (steal a token?  Even my +5 for magic token?  Ridiculous) and others that are functionally useless.  
Third, gems are always in short supply in a four player game...it is a totally valid strategy to horde gems, build out your first row and pass early for the first eight turns and then build like crazy for the last four, effectively forcing your opponents to do the same thing.  
Fourth, and this is the big thing...you just don't do much on your turn.  Yeah, you bid on a card, then you build the card you just bid on most likely.  Then you pass.  Of the twelve turns, seven to ten of them will look just like that.  
Finally, the component quality is all over the place.  The cards are printed on tissue paper, but the cardboard chits are thick and substantial.  Odd, but be warned...the cards will NEED sleeves or I doubt they'll last ten plays.
That's a lot of complaining, but there are some positives: it does play quickly (kind of by necessity), the art is very cool, and the gameplay, while not particularly novel or genre-defining, is at times tense and can be satisfying on the turns when you do more than bid/win/place.
Bottom line:  Feels incomplete/untested (par for the course on Kickstarter games), but there is still fun to be had.  Tentative recommendation, with the above caveats.

Although it's a game with quite simple mechanics, the gameplay is a bit complex due to the enourmous amout of options available. Viceroy is a good game, a little longer than it should be, but fun. The arts/graphic design is fantastic and the amount of stuff the game designer planned is also impressive. 

Unfortunatelly, playing the game shows a high range of not so clear options and can be a little frustrating if some combination of cards do not show up. With only one play it is clear that the game needs some half a dozen plays to be fully enjoyed (and that is ok, BUT there are so many nicer games over there deserving those plays...).

And, last but no least, whata heck is that 'Barter Policy' card?!?!? Stupid card offering an 'attack' action not in terms with every other aspect of this game.

I love the card combos and the pyramid building. A really nice looking game, especially with the playmat and fancy jewels. Viceroy really only gets negative marks because of the frustrating auction mechanic. The worst kind of bidding is paying for a losing/tie bid. I feel like the game requires you to negotiate your purchases with the other players ahead of time so no one waste their jewels, but then that opens the game up to nasty bluffing. It just felt so out of place in an otherwise tight game. I'd love to find a variant to skip all of that.

I've only played this once so far. I certainly wouldn't mind playing again, but I didn't think it was all that good, and it also felt a little strange thematically (it's essentially an abstract, with what looks like a "colonial" theme pasted on, to go by the card names - but not only did there seem to be no connection between the card names and what they do, but what does building a "pyramid of power" have to do with this theme?). You seem to spend the whole game struggling with either cardflow or gems - quite frequently both - and I didn't really see any cards or card combinations which could really help with this apart from on a very temporary basis. Ultimately it felt like a bit of a mishmash - but it's not bad by any means, just not a game I'd really go out of my way to play.

This is the kickstarters version that I will review.

I appreciate that my scoring may be a bit harsh. My major complaint is due to being colour blind. I do appreciate that the makers made an effort to accommodate players like myself, hence why I got the game. However, the colouring does not work. When viewed as a whole, it is normally fine to see any of the gems. The issue arises when using cards to form a circle and trying to align colours. The game maker has tried to make he gems look very nice with shading (my girlfriend says they do). However, since the bottom left/right look a totally different shade than the bottom - it is horrendous for a colour blind person to attempt to form the circles with cards. I know they have put lines in to help differentiate the different colours, but these are hard to see when in the middle of the board. So I tend to slow the game down with comparing every single card in detail. Not fun

The funny thing is that we got a Kickstarter mat to use as a board. The shading on the gems with this mat is different than the game, but these colours are all PERFECT even for most people with colour blindness. If they had used these colours for the gems, I'd have provided a much nicer score.

Unplayability aside, this game does have good quality components, good clear instructions and some interesting game mechanics. Luckily we did not have the packaging issues others did, the box is good quality too. My issue with the gameplay is that you have an action section where you can play up to 3 cards, yet you only obtain one new card per round - so there's very little to do in that part of the round. There is interaction between the players in the auction phase, but there is very little reason to bid against your opponent when there is less than 4 players playing. I think there should be less cards available for auction to encourage more competition for the cards at this stage. I think that, even if I could see the game well enough to play it, I would still give this a low rating.

Simple rules. Not too many different scoring possibilities (mainly magic scrools, sets and circles plus law cards). Some law cards are OP. Aution is not really an auction, but more about bluffing and threatening the other, so he gets out of your way. But can be changed into an auction (see forum variants).
Games can be overwhelming. You try to form circles, manage the small supply of gems, costs for installing cards. For my taste too many things to consider. At the same time not really interesting choices. Science wheels seem weak. It feels like a lot of work. At the same time not much happening.

I have fun with this game. I do love the pyramid building aspect of it and how cards reward you in different ways depending on what level you build them on. I know some people dislike the bidding part of the game, but in the games I've played, players often make deals over who gets what cards easily and rarely does a bidding war last more than two rounds.

There are two steps in every turn of this game. First there is a kind of double thinking auction, in which players try to be the only ones bidding for a card. Then, there is an allocation step, where players play their cards in a pyramid. Each card will give different powers, depending on the place it was played.

I really like the idea of the pyramid building, but the card selection mechanics are very rough. A few of the law cards are simply much more powerful than others, and should honestly be removed. In addition, I don't think the way that the magic, defense, attack, and technology icons work is very well implemented. I like the ideas behind them, and they work better than the card selection mechanism, but still, the mechanics for these icons could have used some more polishing.

 This game hits in a lot of the right areas for me. It has a great mix of strategy and tactics. It is important to have an idea in mind and keep options open, but the flow of the cards might require changing the strategy from turn to turn. I also love how the cards have multiple uses. It can often be a tense choice to decide not only what card to go for, but what level of the pyramid to play it on. Finally, I know we do not talk about components much but the artwork here is amazing. Seriously, this is one of the best looking games we have.

Early Kickstarter backer with gems , playmat, and other goodies.

Playmat has us so spoiled. It adds so much for so little. Better than the gems. I'd prefer colored glass as I like the weight, but my GF and kids like the gems.

Gameplay is easy enough for my 11 yr old to understand, but there are definitely many layers of strategy and ways to score points that we are just starting to understand after two plays. No one knew the first game that points for infinite gems or completed circles were based on tier in the pyramid hence we did poorly there except Alicia who had a +4 for yellow bonus tile and used her OCD to complete most of her circles,and then passed the last round to grab a bunch of yellow gems to paint with. She got 46 points just for completed yellow circles! 92 her first game!

We all had a lot of fun and it hit my gaming G spot (see what I did there?) on a lot of levels: resource management with gems, set-like completion of circles and tokens, many ways to score points via various strategies, bonus tiles, and a point salad Feldian scoring system! As others have sort of said, it feels like Splendor on crack for deeper thinking gamers and scoring feels like 7 Wonders. Everyone should give this game a try. So many good things happening mechanically in this game that it should appeal to a wide variety of gamers.

Played once with 4P. The blind bid is quite a unique take, but you also have to keep an eye out on what opponents would potentially want. That isn't easy though, as it is difficult to glean important information by glancing at opponents' builds.

I liked the idea of building pyramids and awarding bonuses based off the levels. The bonus for creating whole circles was a nice touch too. But it also felt as if there was one mechanism too many hammered in to make it a 'deeper' game. (Possibly, it was the set collection scoring.) Getting card advantage was pretty important here too. The art is nice, but it doesn't blend well with the graphics of the game as the result looks horribly busy.

This game really took me by surprise.  It is incredibly simplistic but at the same time fantastic.

The game is made up of two parts.  A really simple, yet brilliant, auction and a tableau building portion where you are constructing a pyramid of cards.  During the auction 4 cards will be laid out underneath 4 colors.  The colors match the 4 colors of gems in the game that are used for currency in auctions as well as playing cards during the pyramid building phase.  To bid on a card you simply take one of the gems hidden behind your player screen and hold it out.  They are all revealed at the same time and players take the card matching the gem they bid (and lose the gem as payment).  If multiple people bid on the same gem there is a second and possibly a third auction but if each player doesn't bid on a unique card by then all involved parties get nothing.  You can discuss and negotiate who gets what card in between auctions although no actual resources can change hands.  This is such a simplistic and easy to explain system yet it works so incredibly well and offers up a lot of choices, bluffing, and relationship building (good or bad).  I think this particular system makes the game best with 4 when these possible interactions are at their most frequent.

The second phase of the game each player can add up to 3 cards to their pyramid.  Each level gives a different benefit that usually equates to points at the end of the game and costs an increasing amount.  The rewards are usually better to reflect the higher cost.  I found out that balancing resources like number of cards and gems as well as ensuring high point totals became very important during this phase.  I spent like Daddy Warbucks in the early rounds and found myself behind by the end even unable to bid on useful cards during the auction.  The game becomes much tighter than it appers in the beginning.

This is a very accessible game with a lot of depth and interesting choices and one of the most brilliant auction mechanisms I've seen in a game.  Also, it looks fantastic.  I do have the upgraded version with plastic gems instead of the cardboard punchout ones but even without those there is 60+ pieces of unique, detailed, beautiful art on the character cards and it really makes the game engrossing from an aesthetic perspective despite being somewhat devoid of theme.

Each turn players add cards to their "pyramid of power", gaining a benefit depending on its level of placement and potentially bonuses based on its colour.

The most apt comparison is, I think 7 Wonders: several different flavours of set-collection to score a set of cards acquired one per turn. (This is slightly misleading as Viceroy offers many more opportunities to acquire and play additional cards, but they invariably come at significant cost.) 

Rather than a draft, cards are acquired at auction: each card costs exactly one gem in one of four colours and players purchase via blind bid. If two or more choose the same colour, all pay and receive nothing.

As if often the case with this mechanism, it can feel capricious. This sort of bluffing/outguessing does not work particularly well when married to a complex optimisation puzzle; it is too difficult to keep track of what other players are doing, let alone what they might want, for the pychological element to shine.

Equally frustrating is that the semi-random nature of the card pool makes it impossible to guarantee that cards required for a particular strategy will even turn up, crippling long-term planning.

Despite my dislike of both 7 Wonders and Splendor, the two games Viceroy is most often compared to, I'd choose to play either over this.

RATING: 6.75
Pretty weighty game for how short it is. Lots of interesting things to manage and look at. My problem is that it feels a bit repetitive and there isn't enough engine building going on. The "law cards" aren't very balanced and I really wish you'd start with a "draw 5, keep 3" for them or something. Getting a bad set of law cards when others get an amazing set can put you at a huge disadvantage due to their zero cost and potentially game breaking powers.

EDIT: More games where sheer luck gave it to one player over another. Was a combination of good early game draws giving Infinity Gems and matching the right color. Combining that with much stronger law cards just made it really one sided. Still a neat and quick game, but the variance between cards, especially law cards, ca be insane. For example, one law card was a 15 point swing while another law card only added to the game's length. Not sure how you can even come close to comparing the two.

Aesthetics is the only thing it's got going for it.
Although the artwork is good there is no connection between the theme and the gameplay.
Very unbalanced and basicly down to luck.

Kickstarted. Text is pretty small on the cards which makes cards a bit hard to read in a 3-4 player game.  Card stock is a little thin so sleeves are highly recommended.  

Game play is pretty fast and there is some good medium level strategy.  Scoring is a little fiddly but a scorepad is provided to help out.  Looking forward to more plays.

I really dislike the bidding negotiation that is allowed by the rules.  I think it really takes the tension out of the game and ruins it.

Too chaotic with 3 players. Due to simultaneuos building phase, you haven't really got the chance to track other players actions and plans. 
Maybe better with 2 or as a solo game, but I'll pass on this one and rather play Splendor. (same kind of tableau building except for the pyramid.)

The game is an AP prone game. The process in selecting the cards to be placed on your tableau is where things can get a little bit long.

RATING: 1
Did the game designers play test this at all?  Very little way that you can control game outcome because of random card selection.  With each card being different, a lot of time is spent reading cards and deciding.  Mechanic of leavening infinite gemstones on the cards gets confusing.because the cards and game stones are all the same color scheme.  Too many ways to score points.  Law cards contain ambiguities that could have been easily fixed.  Like I said, needed more playtesting... But why bother, this game is just a bunch of random mechanisms thrown together, given awesome art, and sold.  Skip!

Really like the idea of the game and it looked awesome, but actually playing it reveals a few problems.

The biggest issue for me is that there are a few unbalanced cards. One card (one point for each card in your pyramid) is like a free 15+ points, whereas you have to really work to get that many points from any other card. There's also an attack card that can result in more than a 30 point swing (such as your opponent losing 15 points, and you gaining 15 points). There are more cards that seem overpowered, and also several cards that feel underpowered.

My next issue is that the game just doesn't have a good flow to it. You get one new card every round, and it can be hard to get more cards than that, but then there are three card-playing phases every round. You generally have so few cards, at least during certain parts of the game, that the three card-playing phases just don't make sense.

Another issue is the auctions. You can play with "negotiation" where players talk about what they're going to bid on, or you can play with no talk. Either way doesn't work very well. With negotiation you have to either willfully lose gems (the game's currency) by bidding on a card that someone else wants, or you have to sometimes settle for an inferior card. Without negotiation, you would just run the risk of losing a lot of gems.

I know this was an established game before it was Kickstarted in the U.S., but it still feels like it was rushed through playtesting and development in order to get it pushed out on time.

Sold.

Viceroy is a game about hiring/bribing people at court so that you get the most influence and prestige. It's a 12 round game where you can get a card (or maybe not) from the auction every round. Then you can build up to 3 cards. There are ways to get other cards, but it can be tricky to do. You start with 4 cards in hand, only get 12 more (unless you work at it) and have 36 potential build actions.

Every round 4 cards come out for auction, each placed next to a particular color (red, blue, yellow, green). Players choose a gem matching one of those colors and reveal their choices simultaneously. If you're the only person selecting a card, you get that card and you're done for the auction. If you pass, you get your choice of 3 gems from the supply (which is limited) and you're also done for the auction. If you bid the same color as someone else, both of you lose your bid but neither of you get a card. People who don't get a card hold another auction. But if you don't get one by the third auction attempt, you automatically pass.

After the auction, there's a development phase where you have the opportunity to build a card. And then to build a second. And then to build a third. You're building your cards in a pyramid format, where cards on higher levels have to rest on two cards on a lower level. Cards give better benefits if you build them higher, but also cost more to build higher.

There's an element where you want to build certain cards next to each other as every card has part of a circle at the top two corners and the top of a circle at the bottom middle. When you build these line up to form a complete circle. There's a bonus and points if your circle is completely one color.

Cards can give you points, gems, other cards, and tokens that do various things or score you points in various ways. You'll have to decide which level you want to build a card on, as each card pays a different reward depending on what level you build it on. There's a lot of potential for AP as it's a puzzle to figure out which cards to build where... you'll have to look at the costs, the rewards, the circle color matches, how it sets you up for future builds, etc. One of the other players in my game got caught in AP and was taking a long time on turns, which made the game less fun.

The auction mechanic, where you can get screwed if you and another player fight for the same card, is a little painful. You can try to avoid it by negotiating ahead of time, but sometimes you'll just get screwed. Considering the difficulty getting cards, this can really suck.

I'm not sure how I feel about this game yet. It was a little long with four. It's a little painful to try and figure out everything that's going on. I think it'll be a better game when you play with fewer players and if nobody gets stuck in AP. I want to try it a few more times before I come to a decision on it.

RATING: 5
[thing=157526][/thing] is a good game - it provides loads of possibilities and decisions throughout the whole play: besides the consideration about price to acquire and to play the character cards, it is also necessary to ponder about the four effects each one of them have, which are triggered accordingly to the level in the pyramid it is put (in the third level, for instance, the power of level 3 is activated; but also is required to pay three resources) - usually the higher it is, the better, but also it costs more to put the character there. These give a big wealth of options to the players.

[thing=157526][/thing] is pretty dynamic: the auction for the cards is resolved quickly, normally with one or two showing of chips and some talk, if there is overlap in the bids. The phase for playing cards and paying for them is simultaneous. Therefore, downtime tends to be very low, if the players help, of course.

But there are two problems with it: first, it is, essentially, an abstract game - the names, laws, flavor, all is there to make easier to sell the game, without actually impacting in the gameplay or mechanics. This is a minor, however, still it can bother a lot someone hoping for a more thematic experience. Second, and more important, is that, for the most part, [thing=157526][/thing] is a multiplayer solitaire. In the auction phase there is some fricction points, but it is solved fast; and it might not even happen, in case the bids are made for different characters. It is too little to properly feel that you are playing with the others, not just around others: for the most part it is very hard to even follow what others are doing and complicated to try to prevent anything, since every character can have many uses, thus bidding to block someone is difficult and have a price on both players, as the resources are spent.

In the end, the experience of playing [thing=157526][/thing] isn't bad, but it sure leaves a sensation that something important is lacking, to actually making it exciting or disputed, going beyond the simple focus on individual play and mechanics. Thus, in spite of its good ideas, [thing=157526][/thing] ends up as being just an OK game, sadly coming short of what it could be.

Kickstarter: with gems, sleeves and playmat.

Nice quality components: cardboard tokens are nice and thick and punch beautifully; the playmat is a decent thickness and well coloured; Gems are ok but I'm tempted to use the original cardboard gems as they are nice and thick and look really cool! Nice linen finish to the box too. The cards could have been a tad thicker but they are nice and bright and colourful.
All in all components are pretty damn good for the price. 

Gameplay? Played once so far and itching to play again.

I think this game is really under-appreciated and rarely talked about in board game circles I frequent. I'm not sure why. The game is fantastic. While mechanically different, I would pull this out in place of a game like Splendor - the complexity and speed are around the same. It's more of a tableau builder, perhaps somewhere similar to Citadels in some ways. I like it better than both of those games and I expect I'll get a lot of play out of it. I'll need to sleeve it to prevent wear and tear, but thankfully all card types are the same size.

I was disapointed by this one gameplay-wise, feels like something is missing

[+] interesting optimisation puzzle (on what level is this card most interesting for me + gem management + different scoring paths)
[-] the fact that you can build 3 cards a turn and that there are 12 turns and only 15-20 cards to build means you can just get card sfor the first half of the game without necessarily building anything (of course getting a few gems is a plus); on the other hand, in the last turns, you MUST build 3 cards a turn because those last cards (level 4/5) make or break the game (15VP for a level 5 card is huge, don't expect to win without it); limited resources mean that gem hoarding is a real problem; pyramids take a lot of table space; not a big fan of the auction part; as often, end game tallying points is anti-climactic

I enjoy this game.  It combines an auction, set collection, and engine building for a great deal of depth in terms of both strategy and tactics.  That being said, it's hard.  There are almost too many choices in what direction to go with in the drafting and set collection.  The economy is also very tight, at times making it very difficult to do anything at all, let alone what you want to do.  The theme is pretty weak making it less attractive and harder to get to the table.  I usually have to play the solo variant, which is quite good.

Beautiful art. Blind bidding provides real interesting player interaction. And building up your pyramid gives you a great sense of accomplishment. Even if you get demolished in the final score you still feel good about getting the cards you wanted and matching things up nicely. You can take a look at your losing pyramid, and still feel proud. Very fun.

Tile placement auction building a power pyramid of character and law cards. A lot of the excitement is generated from the simultaneous reveal of palmed gems (or gem tokens) at the auction. This is a very cool auction system and I cannot think another similar. Cards you win are laws or characters used to build your power pyramid player sub puzzle. Each card has colored gem fragments depicted on the card face (1/4 on the edges, 1/2 on top). These are aligned to build your foundation and upper levels of your pyramid for immediate benefits and later scoring bonuses. A set collection dimension is introduced by managing scroll, science, sword and shield tokens.  Never have enough gems.

This game suffers from symbol/rule overload. For what it is trying to be it is overly complex and it is difficult to keep track of how scoring works if you don't play it often. I decided to get rid of it when I went through the rules after leaving it on the shelf a while and could not get the game rolling in under a half hour. For some games this is much easier forgiven but this is supposed to be a game you can finish in 45 minutes.

I found the game to be very hard to track, or verify what a player is doing is a valid move, or whether I should bet X to block a rival player.  Even if you did, you still bid 3 times and the 4th time its resolved lowest to highest. 

Downtime is very low, but there are pieces a plenty flying about, if you put a card on higher levels you get all its benefits of lower items, although the cost of it can be  greater dependent upon your gems and infinite gemstones (essentially discounts). Final scoring counts for a lot of points and reminds me of seven wonders.

I am not sure about this game at all. Its fast paced, and downtime is low, the artwork is great -- but the theme is pasted on and I find its too hard to track what player A is going for because it feels more like a solitare optimisation game.

I don't think I'd buy it, but I am up for playing one more time if needed.

Totally theme-less and building your "pyramid of power" sounds a bit naff, but this is a lot of fun to play. The bidding system is interesting, as is the tableau-building, and I enjoy thinking about where is the best place to put down a card. Love the point-scoring fest, although the end-game scoring is a little clunky.

Seems like a fantastic concept and failed execution.  The card art and names are utterly divorced from what they produce.  Some of the promo cards are overpowered to the point of absurdity; what a waste.  The winning strategy seems to be to simply spam cards; no other strategy appears to be viable.  (I'm not giving up quite yet but it looks grim.)

Nem volt rossz, kicsit talán több interakció elférne. A licitálós résztől féltem, de alaptalan volt, egyszerűen megoldották. Fogunk még játszani vele.

Like the way how it works, but I'd need much more cards there to call it perfect

We enjoyed it. Fun and fast enough to squeeze in after a longer session. What more can you ask for?

It has fallen by the wayside. Just too many other great games.

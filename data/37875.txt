A blast to play!  Each side has a different situation, the Japanese get to start hidden, which gives them a lot of fun options to mess with their opponent (while having to worry about the bombardment, whereas the Americans need to get on the beach and establish a beach head, then push in and start killing.  A very close, exciting game.

This is an excellent introductory war game. Good historical field, two very different armies, and highly entertaining if a bit wild due to the importance of artillery barrages.

RATING: 9
Both players will feel severly constrained, it's tough!  Both sides have a lot to think about, multiple options, none of them good.  I'm really enjoying this game

RATING: 6
Initial rating -- game was fun, we'll see about replayability.  Since I don't play ASL, was it worth the $40 I paid for the issue of Operations?  I dunno...

Game seems to be a bit unbalanced -- while playing incorrectly, the Americans seemed unbeatable.  Finally using the correct rules about armor/artillery landings , the game seems almost impossible for the Marines to win, unless the Japanese roll stone dice.

Will probably use as an intro game, giving the newbie the Japanese side...

Not bad as these magazine games go, and short, 2 hours or less. Not very dynamic, for the Marines it's all about using sledgehammer blows to kill stuff, not much maneuver involved (the Japanese can hardly move at all to adjust anyway; they are pretty much done after their opening setup). Not going to be hugely replayable, but again, for a couple hours, very teachable and playable, not bad.

The VCs do seem incredibly wonky though. There are all these ways to score VPs and whatnot, but it boils down to: if the Marines clear the island, they win. If they don't, they lose. There is absolutely no conceivable way they can win on points. So why is it all even in there? It makes no difference, and makes me suspicious. Maybe the Japanese could win by getting to 40 VP for the auto-win, but even that seems wildly improbable.

This is a great little game that captures a brutal, asymmetric battle very well.  It takes a certain kind of person to play the Japanese side, but that person can routinely defeat the US player.  Though their victory can feel Pyrrhic to say the least.

I have increased my rating with repeated play ... always an accolade. 

Make sure to use the errata regarding cave, beachhead, and safe to land marker removal ... ANY hit, whether it causes damage or not, removes a marker.

Also when playing the Japanese, a good setup is essential, but success can hinge on judicious movement and decisive counterattacks.  don't just sit there.

RATING: 7
Excellent game - small, easy to learn, very playable.  Feels pretty historical, allows for Japanese player to use hidden movement due to a privacy screen.  Overwhelming US firepower pitted against hidden and dug in infantry, playable in a few hours.  What's not to like?

RATING: 7
Game about Iwo Jima landing with few innovative twists.
Decent, but after few plays is too repetitive.

RATING: 8
Fun game that plays quickly, and is full of historical flavor.

Hidden Japanese unit placement/movement provides for a tense experience for both players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The hidden setup and movement for the Japanese make this game unique and interesting.  The US has to blindly guess where to use his air & naval support and how many marines to commit when 1st attacking an area.  It also makes for a fluid battle, with the Japanese popping up in unexpected locations to close down beaches and retake airfields.

I think the game captures the feel of the battle nicely, and doesn't take too long to play.

RATING: 5
Un jeu tout a fait correct pour une soirée...Deux parties menées en 3 heures. Mais la rejouabilité demeure très faible car les pauvres Japonais semblent condamnés et ne peuvent l'emporter qu'avec l'effet de surprise d'une première partie...

Another quick, fun, clever little game from MMP. It certainly provides a sense of inevitable doom for the Japanese player. For the Americans it is more like a deadly game of whack-a-mole. I'm not sure how many repeat playings it will bear, but even a few justify a purchase.

Currently in my initial playing of the game on turn 6 playing as the US.  Initial landings went well but I just had two rounds of bad turns.  So far, the game has been very enjoyable - it's easy to learn yet not "lite" as it has enough chrome and options for both players.  Will give a rating once I've completed this a couple of other playings.

Just wrapped up our game.  Lost as the US though you could say it was a nail-biter down to the end (maybe not that close - I wouldn't of been sweating it as the Japanese player).  I won't go so far as to say that there's a balancing issue in favor of the Japanese, but will say that they can be tough; especially if/when the hole up in the "hill" areas.  I took 24 dice to clear out a couple of arty pieces that my opponent had holed up in one hill area that had been a sending harrassing fire all game long.  

Still had a great time and it has the feel of my favorite type of game; one that requires planning aforethought to accomplish what needs to be accomplished (unlike so many "move them where they're the weakest with all that you have").  

Very fun, will enjoy future playings.

Interesting title.  "computerised" movement of Japanese available via online (refer threads) for solo play.

RATING: 7
I would rate this more highly but the bombardment rules are broken. Otherwise it is the best of the "Storm over" series because of hidden units. Other games of this type usually strike me as tedious.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Nice, flavorful slugfest that provides different kinds of fun for each side. A puzzle game that will likely give up its secrets after half a dozen plays, but promises a fun ride to get there. Probably the most fun I've had with an area/impulse game (a system I normally don't like). Not a lot of movement for the Japanese, but shifting things around on the hidden map and deciding when to disrupt the Marines plans still yields a satisfying game. A gem.

RATING: 4
Played twice switching sides.  First game was learning experience.  Second game both sides knew the correct strategy was to obliterate a target with bombardment then walk into the emptied area.

Capturing Suribachi can mean 1-6 VP for the Americans. Probably related to how quickly you capture it?  Wrong, just a die roll.  You can capture it on turn 1 for 1 VP or wait until the very last turn and still get 6 VP (or 1)

It was fun to play once, doubt it will come off the shelf again.

RATING: 7
Fun and tense little game that incorporates a few minor twists to the area-impulse genre.

However, I'm worried that the game could be rather unbalanced in favor of the Japs.

After two playings, feels like a puzzle game.  The US should come at the island with a slow and methodical approach - plaster any Japanese who stick their heads out with supporting arms and go slowly with the armor down the center of the board.  The Japanese need to find a way to stop this.  Can they?  I don't know - I'd moved on to other titles by that point.

RATING: 7
Quick, not overly complex, subtle and realistic. You have to understand how they combat works to get the best for the american side. The idea of a completely static Japanese defence is wrong, tactical movement and some judicious counterattacks are key.

On the downside the combat system and its bucket of dice is tedious at best, awful at worst. Too any dice to rolls in the critical assaults.

RATING: 8
Interesting game on a difficult topic.  A challenge for both players.  Suitable for beginners but not easy to master.

Lots of fun to play (I will play this again and again when I am looking for something challenging but light).

[09/27/2008] One play. Simpler meld of IGO/HUGO and area control mechanisms with hidden/off-board Japanese set-up/movement. Good components, including a mini map for the Japanese player hidden units and a screen to keep them hidden. Tense and short game, but don't be fooled by the game length, this is some serious gaming. A filler wargame, who'd believe that?!?

Just a couple of plays so far, but it has been fun.  Balance was pretty good in the last game as the US got a beachhead around turn 3 but the IJA kept their progress slow through the airfields and ended up with many points at game end for units and territory.

Played 2x against a very good wargaming opponent. Had the Marines both times. The first time, even though I captured Suribachi at historical standard time I could only muster 1 point for its capture. I also made the mistake of trying to bombard too many areas at once. In my second game, I captured Suribachi early (this time it was worth 5 points). I also learned from my mistake with US support the second time. This time I concentrated on no more than three targeted areas. It worked. Fun game, can't wait to try it again.

This is reimplements of Game Journal game.  And in Japan it is said this is worsen version of the original game due to its more lopsided balance.  So, I will not play this version.

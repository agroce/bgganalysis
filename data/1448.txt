This game has grown on me over several plays. When we started playing, we missed the personal yard points and deductions rules. Boy, the third day is a killer with having to empty your yard or lose points yet still build useful trains. Easy to learn but lots of little tactical decisions that will make or break you. Games are usually close (well balanced system) which makes the final day a real nail-biter. Another fine Alan Moon design. Only criticism is the card design. As there's so many cards that have to be placed on the table, had Mayfair printed the car names on the card ends as opposed to the card bottoms, lot's of table space would have been saved.

this is a reasonable game let down by poor artwork.  it's very hard to identify the cards other players are collecting.  if the cards had a solid colour border that matched the name plate on them, this game would move much quicker.

it's a little too long for what it is, but i think this is mainly because you spend so much time trying to see what's happening around the table.

A Moon drafting game which is fun to play but takes a lot of table space and is overly long (for my tastes). Ideal length for this type of game is equivalent to one round of play, however the 3 rounds to provide a nice level of long term planning to the game which would otherwise by mostly inexistent. Turns are relatively tactical in nature, similar to other drafting card games. The end of round card can be a bit unbalancing if it turns up early in the turn order as players later in the turn order can take a caboose to score an easy 3pts. Caboose drafting is therefore very important in the overall scoring and should not be overlooked.

Really nice rummy-esque type game that offers multiple options/choices on each turn.  Played once so far with 2 players - am interested to experience the added tension of more players.  Did not play the alternating turn rule (which would lead to each player having 2 turns then passing to the next) - not sure that would make much of a difference in a 2p game.  Played with my 8 y.o. former "trainiac" son who picked up the flow of the game quite easily - would definitely recommend this as a game for just about anyone - families included(I think 7+ would be a good age).
Edit:  Played 3p game -- definitely a bit more tension than 2 p - excellent game with 3.  Played with the alternating turn rule which makes sense to me now.  Rating may go up after more plays -- really enjoying this game!

RATING: 4
We've only played this with two players, and think it has to be a lot better with more.  The two-player game doesn't have very much competition, except on the "third day."  It just feels like collecting and sorting cards the remainder of the time. We do like the art on the cards, though.

Get a BIG table,  or play it on the floor!  This game takes up a lot of room.  Another train game - sort of a cross between Get the Goods and Union Pacific (without the board).

LOVE IT, Trains, Cards, and a bit of sequential logic. My seven year old caught on after only a few rounds. The wife got it shortly after. I'm gonna get it if she reads this...

I wrote the top part nearly ten years ago. Today I am going back through the collection and having a look at my games. Freight Train is still fum. We've not played it in a few years, but after a few minutes with the rule book we were off and running!

Anyway, this is STILL a good one and worthy of the collection.

I love this game!  Unfortunately I don&#039;t have a table big enough to play this on.:*)  I love the mechanism of moving your trains around in the yard and seeing what is and will be available in the public yard.  I think it&#039;s much better than Union Pacific.

Freight Train is one of several good majorities games from Alan Moon. In terms of game ergonomics, it might be Moon's fussiest design: zillions of tiny cards with lots of shuffling and flipping, requiring acres of table space. Nonetheless, this is a terrific, nuanced game - one of Moon's very best - and well worth the fuss.  I'm not sure why it doesn't get more recognition.  Perhaps many gamers think it takes too long to play or dislike all the management and manipulation of queues of trains.  For me, though, the queues in the different train yards are the heart of the game, providing opportunities for some very satisfying logistical planning.  The tactical manuevering in the ever-changing main yard is balanced by the long-term preparations in the personal switching yard.  Meanwhile there's constant tension in managing your trains and picking your battles with the other players.  Great stuff.

You can see where Alan Moon took concepts from this game and better refined them for games like Ticket to Ride and European Airlines.  This is a good game but what ruins it is the length.  It took us 3 hours to get through a game of this.  For that time, I'd rather play his other games and would get a lot more enjoyment.   This game has more randomness than those other two games (in ToR, if you don't like the colors in the yard you can grab two random cards; in FR you may have no choice)

The mechanics are easy enough but you're always struggling to look across the table and see what trains your opponents are collecting.  Yes the trains and colors are unique but it is still a challenge since their private bumpers may not be ordered.

I&#039;ve only played this with two players, which must be very different than with more.  If there were more players, then someone wouldn&#039;t score at all.

In our game, we used the private yard rearrangement usually as a way to organize the crap there before the next round.  Worked well.

The game takes a fair amount of planning, and has decent strategy.  I like it!   The only drawback is it takes a HUUUUUGE table, even for just two players.

From reading the rules the game seems challenging, but in practice it is quite easy to have a clean private yard.  I find the game to be kind of relaxing to play, and not as demanding of a big table as people always say as long as you overlap the cards.  The main caveat about this game is that you must play quickly for the game to not be too drawn out.  At 45 minutes this is quite fun, but at 1.5 hours I'd choose something else.

There are quite a few similarities between this game and Get the Goods, and I would probably choose Get the Goods first over this one, due to the shortened length of the game.  It is still suspenseful (as in Union Pacific) trying to get as much done before the scoring card is drawn, but I find that Get the Goods is a little more refined and plays quicker.

I really enjoy the plethora of decisions that is offered to you in competing for first and second rank of each train type.  It seems that maintaining flexibility is important as well as planning things right in your freight yard (and don't forget to spend a point to change everything in your yard) relative to what you project other players are aiming for.

Some luck involved in the luck of the draw, but still a good bit of decision making involved in this game.

A good, nicely thematic set collection game with very attractive cards. A better game than the author's much more famous train game I think. The well-written rules smoothly integrate some quaint humor along the way. Takes up a lot of space to play, but maybe that's a good thing--it's very nearly like having a model railroad train yard* set up on your table. Be sure to use the "caboose" option. [10 plays]

*I had a model train set when I was a kid. I whiled away many an hour working on the buildings and scenery. If I had the space and time I'd have a train set yet. Perhaps in another life . . .

It takes up way too much table space, and can be somewhat fiddly, but this is more fun than I was anticipating.

RATING: 8
A game that the family really liked and played most holidays. It's nothing more than a 2 hour drafting and set collecting game. The 5x5 draft means you have 5 cards immediately available, but if you take from one of the rows, you can delve further into that row, making it a lot more interesting than your normal 5 card draft, where you simply take one and replace it. 

The other attractive feature is your stock pile, which you need to clean out before the game ends. This gives the other players knowledge on what each player is likely to collect, meaning they can somewhat plan to avoid conflict. 3 points for first vs 1 point for second means it's all about collecting firsts. We always play with cabooses which add another decision factor (to spend a turn not picking up cards) in order to double points, but at the risk of being overtaken in the caboosed set because you can no longer add to it.

So it has mechanisms that make it special over normal set collecting games, but the game length can restrict it from rotation.

After one 2-player game, a provisional rating of 6 that assumes a 4-player game would be much more interesting. This 'perfect information' Rummy game is hampered by its space requirements. In order to utilize the information revealed on the table one would either literally have to walk around the table or have the memory of a Vegas card counter. I'd advocate a 'scoreboard' player's aid that would give a running accounting of whom had collected what. Otherwise, blind collecting of cards would rate about a 4.

My wife likes to play this. Has a fair amount of complexity as you try to balance what you have versus what others are collecting. 
Nice take on set collecting as you try to diversify enough to have a bunch of trains going and keep in scoring position in the ones you are collecting

RATING: 9
This game would get a lot more love if it wasn't so old and ugly.  There's a lot of maneuvering to make sure you have the most of each different train and you're always watching you're opponents to see what their doing.  There is some randomness as to how the cards come up, which adds tension as you're hoping the card you're looking for will be too far away for your opponent to take.  Be warned that this little card game takes up a LOT of table space.  
But I love this game!

I haven't found this to be much fun with 2 players; otherwise its an unspectacular, card game.  Another slight negative is that it takes up a ton of table space.

My first impression was that there were limited decisions to be made and not much to think about, but after the second day ended things clicked.  You need to challenge your opponent(s) in some train lines and win those challenges to gain any ground.  Plus the importance of the private yard became even more apparent as well.  There is a lot of neat maneuvering involved in this game and I'm looking forward to trying it with more than two players.

(When rating games I focus on the "how likely I am to play this game again" part of the BGG description rating, as opposed to the "quality" part of the rating.)

A very good set collecting game that paved the way for Get the Goods/Reibach & Co. & Airlines/Union Pacific.

In some ways I like this better, because of the ways the different rounds are handled and purity of the design.

這是著名設計師 alan (alan moon) 設計的遊戲。

整個遊戲的機制非常簡單爽快，是個卡牌拿取和組合收集機制的遊戲，整個遊戲在大桌子上攤開的場面可謂是頗為壯觀呢。

機制雖然簡單，其實仔細想一下，策略深度其實不淺，玩好一款貌似簡單的遊戲，其實對任何程度的桌遊玩家來說都不是一道很容易的題目呢。

This was a pleasant little game. At first I thought it would be a very multiplayer solitaire affair, but there is a decent amount of indirect player interaction. The game is fairly simple, and I think it goes on for a little to long for what it is.

I've only played the original White Wind version of this.  It is cumbersome and overly, dare I say, fiddly.  There is a lot of movement, but I'm not convinced that there is that much game.  It is basically just a set collection game.  

Now, I will say that it is innovative for its time.  It was really pushing drafting cards to an extreme at a time where no one was even touching this mechanism.  It is kind of fun for a little while, in an incidental kind of way, but it soon reveals itself to be lucky, repetitious, and overly long.  Three rounds is far too long for the number of real decisions to be made.  This time period in games was really all about repeating the same thing three times (with a slight twist in the bridges).

Richelieu seems to have borrowed from this a bit, and made a much better game.

Reminds me of Acquire in the sense that you're trying to outcollect your opponents, creating tension on every turn.  The game I played took a couple hours or so, which might turn off some people, but I was on the edge of my seat much of the time.  Looking forward to playing again.

It's an okay card game.  Unfortunately, it's way too long to enjoy this game.  If this were a 30 minute card game, this might be a better game.  At 90  minutes, I am bored to tears playing this game.

2-player review: We enjoy this game...sometimes. Theres not a whole lot of strategy going on here, very simple set collection game. It can be very frustrating when you get "stuck," due to the luck of the card draw. There is also almost no catch-up mechanism. If you are in the lead after the first day, its very easy to play to 'match' your opponent, and almost impossible to catch up if you're losing. Though, I could see this only really being a problem with 2 players.

The scoring seems oversimplified for 2 players and the Caboose cards seem way overpowered with 2. I think this game could really use some house rules for 2 players. The scoring needs to be tweaked a bit.

Sold.

A basically good forefather of the TtR series which would make a nice combo with any TtR game, if it only wasn't so damn long. It also suffers from a somewhat self-published appearance - the cards are tiny and not easy to tell apart, making it quite difficult to keep an eye on other players' trains and yards. For these reasons, a 7 instead of 8.

A fun game by Alan R. Moon.  Theme is well integrated with the mechanic, unlike Mr. Moon's big train game, Ticket to Ride.  Very trainy feel to it.  Set collection mechanic applies well here.  A train game that isn't about network building!  Just make sure you have a fairly big table.  Finally gave away due to space and time constraints, but still like the game.

A pretty decent set collection game.  I obviously didn't quite grasp the strategy, as I quickly fell quite a few points behind my friends.  I made up ground in the end, but not quite enough.  This one might go up or down a bit in future plays.

Second play:  I like the mechanic, but knocked down a quarter point for the huge amount of fiddliness with the million cards spread out over an acre of table space.

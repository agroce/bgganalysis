I love this game! It's interesting because the gamers introduced me to it, but my novice-gaming friends love playing it too. It's a nice cross between Outburst and Trivial Pursuit. And the cute rubber pants that come in the box, make for funny comments too.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
At first glance, seems similar to Outburst, without the screaming.  Which is a good thing.

This game is actually a rather decent party/trivia game.  The "whomever is losing is the reader" rule keeps things balanced.  Quite nice, and a worthwhile addition to your collection.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A nifty little trivia party game. Most trivia games, by nature, tend to reward the trivia masters while leaving those with less knowledge hopelessly behind. This game uses some very simple mechanics and some widely varied topic cards to help balance that out. It's been fairly warmly greeted when it's hit the table.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a nice party game, and can be very fun if played with the right crowd.  The major problem that this game has is that some of the answers are just wrong, or they are right but in a very obscure way that they are hard to guess.

RATING: 6
Take Outburst, make it a little more organized, and you have Smarty Party.  It is a lot of fun, and plays in less time than some of the more tedious party games.  The downside to the game is that some of the categories seem less than accurate.  Also there seems to be a heacy variance in the difficulty of the questions.  It gives more variety, but some people will get frustrated with the difficult questions.

There is a decent catch-up mechanic, so that players who are doing bad get to read the questions.  This often takes some of the sting out of losing.  Still, if you aren't good with trivial pieces of information, this game won't really work for you.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Compared to the average "Party Game"

Pluses:  
Game time is limited by point system of first to get so many negative points.
Lists are of subjects that almost anyone can guess at.

Minuses:  Lists of "subjects that almost anyone can guess at" get's boring. Like, all the lists of countries.

Eh... I can take it or leave it. Plusses: short, so it doesn&#039;t overstay its welcome, and is modestly amusing. Minus: very uninspiring lists. With us, it was all or nothing, and there was no guessing. Nobody watches The West Wing or Sponge Bob Squarepants, so when that came out, we were hosed; The Fellowshp of the Ring, on the other hand ... The only really interesting list was &quot;ways to kill a vampire and major financial indicies&quot;, although to give you an idea of how insanely xenophobic this game is, the Nikkei and DAX are apparently not major financial indicies but AMEX is. The lists also often reduce large categories like Grimm&#039;s Fairy Tales using a &quot;well known&quot; prefix, which usually just leaves knowledgeable players wondering which stories are &quot;well known&quot;. The lists could have been a lot more interesting, as it was it was just a trivia quiz without any inherent interest, nobody saying &quot;that&#039;s interesting&quot; after hearing the answers. Not bad, but not one I&#039;d really be interested in playing again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Pretty fun in a Family Feud sort of way.  The question quality varies quite a bit though... we left it up to the current reader whether he wanted to use the current question or pass to a new one.  Also, in a Family Feud sort of way, some of the answers were really a crap shoot!  Questions such as "top US hobbies" or "most popular US dog breeds" often had some oddball answers.

Still, it was a fairly good time for a trivia type game that I wouldn't be opposed to playing once in a while!

RATING: 7
Less trivia than educated guessing, a twist that along with Wits and Wagers, has made the trivia genre palatable. Some lame categories, but like most party games of this type, if the group doesn't like the question, just move to another one. Problem Solved.

Update: lowered to a 6. Expansions and curation solve some of the bad questions problem, but there is still a problem throughout the base and expansions of questionable answers on factual questions. They are just flat out wrong in some instances. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Decent party game.  Players need to know elements from certain categories.  My only problem with party games like this is, you're either good at this or not.  You cannot possibly get any better other than to study every Jeopardy category for 10 years.

Great trivia/party game that gets everyone involved and doesn't suffer from the Trivial Pursuit style roll-answer-roll-answer syndrome.

Burnout has started after about 20 plays.  It is still a good party game for when you have a lot of people because it can be played while everyone just sits around without having to be near the board.

Popular with my group, even though the trivia buffs always win it.  It's still fun for all.  Sort of a family feud dynamic, with a list of answers that slowly gets whittled down until completed or no one can think of any others.  Highly recommended.

Possibly the best trivia game out there!  I like the categories (the pop culture ones are fun and I'm from the US, so the US-centric ones don't bother me), the balancing mechanism (the person in last place is the reader, so they can't get slammed that round), and the quickness of the game (best with generous use of the timer).

I loved this game.  The only problem is there isn't very many cards.  Even with the expansion it has very limited replayability.  As long as you are ok with that, it is a ton of fun.  

After more plays, it can drag a little.  I wish it were shorter but I'll still play. :)

See my (old) [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/35497]review[/url].

The capsule: This is probably the most gamer-friendly of trivia designs. The use of lists limits player downtime, it scales well to a high number of players, and has a modest play length that doesn't drag on past the point of interest. On the flipside, many of the lists have arbitrary or subjective answers, lists aren't really reusable (and there aren't that many to start with), and there seems to be large disparities in the difficulty of a given list (and an enormous American bias in the choice of topics and answers).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Components: Ugly board, but useable pawns, fun smarty pants, and a functional question viewer. The initial pack of cards lasted me seventeen games.

Experience: Family-Fued-style trivia game that is quite entertaining, so long as the timer is used to move things along. The categories are interesting, and the mishmash of the combined categories is entertaining in itself (name a largest island, or a popular US amusement park). It has been only the rarest of categories that found noone among the group to enjoy it. I would gladly play this any time.

In 2014, the trivia is becoming a bit dated and arbitrary (name the ten NFL teams who most recently visited the SuperBowl as of 2004). Sometimes the answers themselves don't seem quite right, but it's fun to argue about them.

I always rate party games with the caveat that they are not my favorite genre by a longshot.  This one was pretty fun, though I preferred the questions that weren't dated to those that were.  We had several questions dealing with TV shows that we found confusing because even though the game was only a year or so old, we didn't know whether the shows were still on the air or not (yes, the soaps were but not all the talk shows were).  We also had problems with the 'popular US names' question for similar reasons - the names that were popular for us and our contemporaries are different than the names people name their kids these days.  This will be a bigger problem for people playing in future years I think.  Also, part of the fun of a game like this is the learning aspect and none of us much cared to learn about the pop-culture stuff as much as the geography, biology, arts etc.  Overall I enjoyed though because I could show off what I knew without being obnoxious about it and also the game was fairly short (unlike Trivial Pursuit, which can drag on and on.)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
We played that the reader got to pick the category card. The reader misjudged our expertise quite a bit (we DID know the characters in The Jungle Book but did NOT know the cloudiest countries in the world). I don't like the scoring board - the same few people get to read every time, if they get too far behind.

I cannot stand knowing-stuff games but Smarty Party is quite nice.  Everyone knows something.  Balancing rules if you're in last place and you get to be the reader which is fun.

RATING: N/A
Party/trivia game centered around the idea of players collectively naming items on a list (e.g. "10 US states with most shoreline"). As players, in turn, miss an item, they acquire penalty points (forward movement on the game board). When a player reaches the end of the track, the person who advanced the least is the winner.

Combines Trivial Pursuit and Outburst (though there's no real-time screaming).

Fun trivia game that allows "runaway losers" to stay in the game.  The person in last place gets to sit out (and thus can't accumulate negative points) and ask questions, keeping everyone in contention.  Scaling up to 8 players is a huge bonus.

[4 plays] Good trivia game with Family Feud-style action.  Nice mechanics; I like the smarty pants and the catch-up mechanism for the person in last place.  Trivia games so easily become really unfun for whoever is trailing the pack, and I really like that this one keeps the last player involved (as the reader) and gives them an easy opportunity to prosper.  I also like Smarty Party for the diversity of the categories.  For every card on baseball, there's one on children's books, or national parks.  A nice mix, so that again no one is totally excluded, which makes this a good game with almost any group.

Because the chips get spread out more with more players, shorten the track when playing with 7 or 8 otherwise it drags on too long.

Also, with 5 or more players, seems to work best to just have one person in charge of the score track to move everyone's pawns.

RATING: 6
Smarty Party is a trivia game that does a pretty good job of solving the "either you know it or you don't" problem of most trivia games.  Each question has a list of several valid answers, and players offer answers in turn until all are guessed or until a prescribed number of wrong answers are given.  You are penalized for wrong answers and rewarded if you are the last one to come up with a valid answer.  The genius of this system is the way that the answers given will progress from more commonly known items to more obscure items.  All the players will feel like they're a part of things, whether they know a little about the category or a lot.  Unless of course they know absolutely nothing about a category, in which case they might feel colossally stupid.

Unfortunately, the quality and consistency of the lists chosen is disappointing.  First of all, there are too many pop culture lists, in which you either know a valid answer or you don't.  I wish the designers had focused on lists that allow for educated guessing, such as "heaviest land mammals" or "top world religions by number of followers."  Secondly, the question set is steeply skewed in favor of male players.  Third, there aren't nearly enough cards included for a trivia game such as this.    Still, it's a very good game.  I'm hoping for an expansion with more and better lists.  Meanwhile, I might make a project of making up some of my own for others to use. [Update - the expansion sets have much better questions on the whole.]

Despite the fairly common wrong and/or obscure subjective answers, Smarty Party is a pretty decent party/trivia game.  The scoring is a little screwy, too (what party game doesn't have crappy scoring, I wonder).  It seems like you want to be a sub par player until you get toward the end so you can be asking the questions that will trigger the ending.  That way you'll sit pretty while your opponents are forced to move down the track.  There are most definitely other party games I would prefer to play before this title due to the aforementioned.

 I usually don't like games like this so but it's a little better than most even though you should still play it with gamers. Stick to Apples to Apples for non-gamers.

This one reminds me a lot of Outburst, a game I used to play often in my early 20's with my friends.  I like that the reader is more involved though, being able to wager on whether the group will or won't succeed at getting the required number of answers correct.  The only con is remembering to move the player's backward when they get the smarty pants and have no chips.  Otherwise, excellent game!

It has one essential aspect of the party game: "gee, I can't believe you (knew/didn't know) that, which keeps it fun.  OTOH, I think better games like Taboo, Balderdash, and "What Were You Thinking?" involve some user creativity - something beyond just getting the right answers.  However, the game moves along briskly (a comparitive weakness of Balderdash), and the game play itself is well thought out.

I am sorry that it took so long to get around to playing this game.  It really is a great trivia game.  I like how the knowledge required is not extremely specific, and also how you are never completely out of the game.  Of course, knowledgeable players will always be at an advantage, but with evenly matched skill, the game is very entertaining.  The one drawback is the finite number of categories, including some that may be out of date (and some containing answers that seem just plain wrong).

I don't like trivia games that much, but at least Smarty Party has some interesting mechanisms to help slow the loss of the less knowledgeable players.

Above average party game with a clever scoring mechanism and a nice method of keeping someone from falling way behind.  Like all games of its type, it suffers somewhat from the fact that often you know a category very well or not at all and the most fun categories are those where your knowledge is at neither extreme and you find yourself thinking and grasping for the right answer.  Rattling off the whole list and not having a clue about any items are equally unsatisfying.

Playing this with a bunch of drunk people (myself excepted, because I don't drink) is exactly as unfun as a sane, sober person would expect. Not only are some of the answers out of date (not that drunk people are likely to care about that sort of thing), but it takes way longer than I would like.

Okay, it's not so much that it takes a [i]lot [/i]of time. But it does take [i]some [/i]time, and I'd prefer it simply cease to exist, thereby eliminating the possibility of it taking [i]any [/i]time.

Also, is the word "Smarty" supposed to be ironic? Honestly, the most fun I had in the vicinity of this game was wondering if the designers were just having a laugh about that.

This is a good party-style trivia game that's like "Family Feud"--players are trying to guess items in a list.  It's a lot of fun, but not for people who don't like trivia.

I wish players had more control over the categories of the trivia questions.

Absolutely brilliant trivia game, a mix between "Family Feud", "Trivial Pursuit" and typical German strategy games.  My only problem is the kinds of questions you get, if you're not an American who knows alot of TV trivia...you won't get many answers correct.  I can see why this game isn't sold here in Finland but other R&R games are.  I'm sure they'll have expansions come out soon and no doubt I'll buy them.  It's a shame this game was released with a bigger publisher because it may not get the popularity it deserves.  My 2nd favorite party game next to "Balderdash/Beyond Balderdash."  For a 3-player game, we removed one '2' chip and one '1' chip and that seemed to work quite well.

Nice variant on the Outburst idea, but you can get really hammered by a bad topic if everyone else knows the answers.  Love the scoring systems and, of course, the PANTS.  For some reason this is one of those party games that I like a lot (and am fairly good at) but those that  I play with are lukewarm about playing.  So it won't get to table as much as it might deserve.  Fun game.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Best design for a trivia game, weighed down by inferior questions.  Its strongest feature is that everyone is involved all the time, not just the reader and answerer.  You're always hoping nobody says the answer you have in your head!  When I play trivia games, I generally like having teams, so you can discuss answers with teammates.  That is not possible with this game, but there is still enough conversation generated, as people go, "Ohhh I know this I know this!!" "Be quiet, I'm thinking." The fun is the tenseness that builds as all the good answers for a question get taken, leaving you racking your brain:  "what's left, what's left, aha how about cape verde islands!! dang, julie just took that."  I like our house rule of skipping a question if everyone in the group vetoes it.  This keeps the game from undergoing one of the problems that some others here have mentioned.  

2nd edition supposedly has corrected questions/answers, though based on what I've seen so far, many of the questions are still very vague.  Would give it a point higher if the questions were better (i have hopes for the expansion).

Smarty Party is a good game that everyone at the table can be involved in.  Even if a player performs poorly, then that player becomes the reader and has a lesser-chance of moving forward.

Not bad for a party game and you don't have to possess Trivial Pursuit type knowledge to win.  It helps, but is not critical, plus the categories lean towards pop culture.  Using a timer is a must if you have any players in your group who tend to ponder their responses for five minutes.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This game reminds me a lot of Outburst.  Even down to the red screen contraption that reveals the hidden answers on the card.

This is essentially not anything more than a trivia game.  Each round a reader reads 1 or 2 categories on a card and players will take turns giving an answer in those categories.  Wrong answers move you along a board and when someone crosses the last space whoever is furthest back (got the fewest wrong answers) wins.

The categories are actually interesting so for a trivia game I liked it.  In the end though it doesn't add anything to the formula, it's just trivia.  I'm thinking about keeping it just for the neat questions on the cards except I would have to use the stupid red screen contraption to read them easily.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Granted it is a party game, but I think it is a very good one that keeps everyone involved until the end.  I don't tend to like obscure trivia games (e.g., Trivial Pursuit) but I still want some thought and strategy to go with my party games (such as in Times Up).  Smarty Party accomplishes both admirably.  Sure you can sit there and just give the first answer that pops into your head but you can be more strategic.  For instance, to play well you need to figure out what the least obvious answer is and then reserve that to get the bonus as the last one to get a correct answer.  Also there is the questioner's forecast of whether the others will score above a certain number of points, so everyone is involved in every round.  I also like that the person in last place is the questioner and their position on the board is protected from deteriorating further (and may improve if they forecast correctly).  This keeps everybody in the game until the end which makes it more interesting and fun, particularly for non-gamers.  All in all this is a great game that you should absolutely try if you like party games at all.

Quite a good party game.  Yes, it's a trivia game, but it's also a memory game as well.  Among my friends and family I normally dominate trivia games to the extent that no one will play them with me any more.

A good party game - fun with the right group, but it's no Time's Up!  A downside is the low number of questions provided, but hey, it's a party game.

Update - Played it a few times more at game night, and it was a lot of fun.  Sometimes the categories are easy, and sometimes too hard.  This is a game that no one ever requests I bring, but when I do bring it, everyone sees it and says "Oh yeah, the game with the rubber pants!" and wants to play again.

Update - This has become a regular favorite at my game nights, and when I don't bring it, there are disappointed faces.  It doesn't take long to play, so it's great as the game to play between the opening filler, and the meatier game.  I even had to buy the expansion.  Upgraded from 6.1 to an 8.

Smarty Party! is basically Family Feud with a bonus for the last correct (ie, most difficult) response on the list.

As with all trivia games, the questions in Smarty Party! can be too American-centric which makes it a tough game for a diverse crowd. Players who are not strong in trivia can easily get sidelined and feel left out or embarrassed. That, in my book, is not a good game.

I have no bias against party trivia games. While most trivia games suffer from the same fate, a good example of a trivia game done properly is Wits and Wagers. I think it is an excellent example of an all-inclusive party game with an element of risk-taking. The same cannot be said about Smarty party.

One of the better party games I've played. The free-for-all system nicely solves the Outburst problem of teams just getting totally hosed by cards.

All of my attempts to play this game have invariably included the phrase: "That question sucks." And it's true, many of the questions were apprently written by semi-sentinent beings intent on creating an air of vagueness.  Name the top 10 brands worldwide.  In sales? Name recognition? According to? The gameplay is good and some of the cards are hysterical... but you could build a better game with a good almanac and some cardboard.  You'd miss out on the rubber pants, of course... but save yourself a few bitter arguments.

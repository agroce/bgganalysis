RATING: 7
A lot more complicated than [b]Bang Dice[/b], the [b]Bang[/b] game I play most often these days.  Probably more complicated than normal [b]Bang[/b] too.  Longer than its predecessors, but still fun.  Good use of semi-asymmetrical decks and shuffling them together later.

RATING: 6
It uses a similar set of cards to go about hitting and missing BANGs. The Equipped choices are restricted to active or reserve players. 

The active and reserve characters are a way to lengthen the game. And it does away with the mystery of who the bandits are and who is the deputy. That is almost half the fun being taken out. In so, it is nothing more than drawing of cards and playing it directly against your opponent. 

It is now indeed a Duel. And nothing like the original Bang. 

Rated as an independent game by itself and not related to Bang.

A nice 2-player edition of the classic card game without the deduction and bluffing elements of course. A nice addition to my collection since I love spaghetti western themed games!

RATING: 3
A game based pury on lousy 2 player rules from the original, just slightly modified. Pick Revolver instead for a 2 player wild west shootout.

RATING: 8.4
This is just as cool as its original multiplayer card counterpart, as well as the dice implementation. It's BANG! for two players, and I really like how you select characters at random and then assign one Active and the other as a Rearguard. I also love how the two decks start out asymmetrical in abilities, but then you discard them to a common pile, so later reshuffles might allow you to use the opponents' card abilities...that adds an almost cinematic little turncoat quality to the whole affair. I still think BANG! is ideal with more players, but this is quite a fun variant, that alone is superior to either of the others (sans expansions).

Just not that fun. Directions were not that clear in terms of card play. Could just be because this was my first game in the Bang! series.

- Doesn't have che charm of the original Bang!

RATING: 4.5
Pretende complicar una mecánica que sin esa complicación sería demasiado sencilla, y consigue aburrir igual que si fuera sencillo. En definitiva es un juego de sacar cartas y dar tortas. La gestión de mano es mínima, evidente, y según el azar, poco recomendable. Aburrido.

This captures the feeling of the original Bang!, but certainly feels like it's a missed opportunity, since it doesn't improve a lot, and there were a lot things to be improved I  Bang! (even if I loved the original).

Still feels like Bang, but mostly removes the question of who to shoot. At the end of the day, it is still Bang and suffers from the randomness of the deck.

I enjoyed this fresh take on the Bang! universe and play. The original Bang! has long since lost its appeal for me, but as a two-player game I really enjoyed Duel. Ultimately, however, I felt 7 Wonders: Duel--released around the same time--was a better game.

RATING: 9
A BANG! játékkal mindig is szemeztem, de sosem vettem meg, elég volt csak hallani illetve olvasni másoktól, hogy ha az elején kiesel, akkor várhatsz unatkozva, meg min. 4 főtől lesz érdekesebb, de jobb ha több stb.

Viszont mikor a párommal is játszható, gyorsan lezavarható 2 személyes játékot kerestem, akkor erre esett a választás, és bizony nem bántuk meg. Nagyon jól kiegyensúlyozott a két oldal.

Ajánlani tudom csak.

RATING: 5
Jópofa és hangulatos kétfős kártyajáték. A mechanika szórakoztató, és a rendelkezésre álló karakterek közötti váltakozás (ki aktív és ki nem) érdekes. Nagyon szerencsefüggő, ami a "parti" jellegét tekintve nem olyan óriási gond, viszont szerintem kicsit túlságosan is elhúzódik. Igazából a kétfős kártyajáték kategóriában csak akkor teljesít jól, ha valaki Bang! rajongó és még kettesben is ezt szeretne játszani. Egyébként nem annyira nélkülözhetetlen. :P

What is Bang without the hidden roles?

Still quite fun, but unnecessary. Other 2 player games are much better.

I wish the decks had more differences ... like 100% different would be nice.

The sharing of the decks after they are depleted is strange. It feels off in gameplay and thematics. Also, it is a pain to separate the decks after each game.

Man, talking about this games makes me like it less. So, I'll stop because it isn't a bad game and I want to play it more.

This duel version of the original one is waaaay better than his older bro. Also the artwork is nicer. You need to find the right strategy in a combination of ability and luck.

Exactly what it's marketed to be: Bang for two. The game works pretty well, but I can't help but wish I was playing regular Bang or the dice game while playing this. The lack of hidden roles takes a large chunk out of the enjoyment here, and not having different players to play off of is also a big detractor. What is cool here is how this 2v2 shootout plays out. When one of your characters dies, usually a new one comes in to take their place. You also only go through your faction-specific deck once before you mix everything together to increase the chaos. Aside from those things, I just felt like the pace was off here. There are too many dead turns, and the game goes on far too long for what it is.

Would rather play Revolver, which has the same theme and offers a better experience in a fraction of the time.

NO LONGER IN COLLECTION.Takes all the "Bang!" parts of Bang! and does away with the silly deduction element. If you liked the original, but thought the deduction was an unessential element--then you might enjoy this. Has the option to "toggle" between two characters during play. Plays smoothly with the asymmetric decks in a nice thematic way. Does drag if players choose to have a lot of characters, but this is easily fixed by using less. This does not make the game less fun as the main decks are not affected by this change. Likely to replace Star Realms as main direct combat game.

There can be a lot to keep track of, between equipment effects, character abilities, etc., but that's the only real negative for me. I like the variety introduced by the multiple characters, and I also like how you end up with a common draw pile midway through the game. Definitely a go-to 2 player game for me.

This is a pretty fun game. It is Bang for 2 players. I've only played it once, but it was pretty solid. Not quite as good as Bang Dice though. A 2-player version of that would be EPIC!

Acquistato da GamesAcademy Palermo. Dopo svariati mesi avendo molti altri titoli lo ho provato. C'è qualche titubanza, ma mi piace il western e mi riprometto di provarlo ancora. Per adesso non metto neanche la valutazione e siamo a maggio 2017. Aggiornamento maggio 2017, come si può evincere dallo storico effettuate diverse partite, confermo un buon voto. Ottimo gioco di carte a due giocatori si ritaglia un posto fra i miei giochi preferiti, miei e del mio gruppo.

This game packs a lot into a small, short game. Small footprint, short playtime, small box. But decent strategic choices and a lot of fun. Perfect filler while you are waiting for stragling gamers to show up. One of the better dice games around.

From the Reviews: This looks a lot better than I had originally thought, a "civ-light" kind of rubbed me wrong. As for a light filler game, this looks great!

RATING: 8
One of the best "dice-economic" games.  Very fun, with a short playtime.  Very high quality components, but my only gripe is that you have to be looking at the rules, player aid, score sheet, and board altogether before the rules make any sense.  If you were being taught the game (instead of learning it cold), it would be pretty easy.

Great small box.  Winner of dense-est box of the year, though.

Update: Not a fan of the trading variant.  Better trading implementation in the expansion.

+ Super creative use of dice; It's a civ-builder in less than 30 minutes!

I wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't tried it -- a fun, dice-based [i]civ[/i] game.  Plays pretty quickly, though there will be some downtime between turns.  Relatively little player interaction (limited availability of monuments, some disasters affect opponents).  But darnit, it (sorta) feels like a civ game!

The dice-rolling doesn't impinge on the underlying mechanics.  Initially, you want everything -- it becomes a matter of prioritizing your goals followed by luck of the rolls.  Later on, as the game progresses and you develop a strategy, your preferences become more concrete and directed.  The inclusion of a food requirement serves to temper your goals.  I like the implementation of the disasters since they have a very real risk/reward balance.

Oddly enough, I like this game.  It will probably go into my "longer filler" category (playtime at 20-40 min.), particularly as there is a medium-strength luck element.

Also, I have a sneaky suspicion this may become another pseudo/almost-gateway game for 2-4 players.  Easy to explain, easy to play, but with a small side of strategy and options.  I don't think it would be overwhelming, particularly as a follow up gateway game.

RATING: 7
FAMILY, STRATEGY

This game immediately reminds one of Yahtzee and Stone Age, two completely different games united by their use of dice. Roll dice to earn money, acquire resources, recruit workers, and build cities, monuments and developments. Lots of strategic choices and even interactivity, as you race against others to build cities first for more points and avoid the consequences of others' "disasters."

Probably would be a good game to take along camping! The components are wonderful: large dice with unique symbols and thick wood game boards that remind me of cribbage.

Recommended with 1-4 players (best 2). 30-45 mins.

With Late Bronze Age.

Overpriced, and sort of dull for two -- talk about 2 player solitaire!  But it's quick and sort of interesting so far, I guess.  If there was less arithmetic when aiming for big developments I'd like it much more.  As it is, when I'm doing that you can go get a drink while I add.

Hrm, but it grows on you after a few plays, once you accept taking a nap during other players turns...

I really enjoy this game. There is certainly some depth to your choices but nothing that slows the game down to any amount. The multiple paths to victory all seem viable making for lots of interesting choices and a game that doesn't depend on the luck of the dice roll. The components are all excellent and very functional. Excellent family game.

Pros
- Nice components
- Thick wooden dice
- A lot of paper
- Short filler with depth
- Upgrades and powers are fun 

Cons
- Multiplayer solitaire, so it can be dull
- Moving the pegs on the board is a hard mechanic to grasp and seems abstract 

Sold/Traded because:
- Too tame for the group
- Scoring is usually a chore at the end 
- Not enough interaction between players 
- End game is rather lackluster

1-4

I can understand some of the criticisms, but it's pretty fun and easy. It feels several turns too short and workers do feel a bit strong. Still, there aren't really any "bad" rolls (though, often, coins aren't going to be welcome), but there are a lot of different resources to manage, and there's a nice bit of press your luck with the skulls. Feels perfect for the space it's designed to play in.

Quick game which gives me a similar feel to Stone Age, but plays much faster and offers some really unique choices in terms of development buys vs. monument building.  May end a bit too fast however, but this problem is easily solved through various house rules (upping developments needed to trigger end condition and just requiring all the monuments to be built).

This Yahtzee style game is often said to be a civ-game distilled down. But it never felt that way for us.  You roll dice to match symbols in order to fill out a pad to build structures. build armies, do agriculture, etc. But it doesn't feel like you are doing anything but rolling dice. Civ games make you feel like you're building something. Plus the game is so quick that it didn't feel like there was enough time to really do anything before the game was over.

I realy like the wooden components, the resource boards and the dice.
The [thing=47389]The Late Bronze Age [/thing] version adds a little more complexity to the base game.
Played it with 2 players and with the maximum of 4 players.
But mostly I play it solitair (highest score).
A very good overview about this game is to find here: [geekurl=/thread/380167/a-comprehensive-pictorial-overview-pandemics-desi]Bronze Age Solo[/geekurl]
I gave it also as a small present.

\_______GER_______/
Eine Priese Würfel-Kniffle und eine Portion Aufbau in einer durchaus spannenden Kombination zusammen gebracht.
Das Spielmaterial aus Holz ist sehr ansprechend.
Insgesamt ein kurzweiliges Spiel, bei dem man doch etwas darüber grübeln kann, wie man seine Würfel und Rohstoffe am Besten einsetzen soll. Und dabei gibt es doch schon eine Menge Alternativen zu bedenken (wenn die Würfel nicht vollkommen gegen einen sind). 
Ich habe das Spiel jetzt auch in der Solo-variante schätzen gelernt und dadurch meine Beurteilung weiter nach oben verschoben. Beim Solospiel hat man nur 10 Züge Zeit seine Siegpunkte zu optimieren. Eine sehr gute Beschreibung von dem Spiel ist hier zu finden: [geekurl=/thread/380167/a-comprehensive-pictorial-overview-pandemics-desi]Bronze Age Solo[/geekurl]

[thing=47389]Späte Bronzezeit[/thing] ist eine sehr gute Erweiterung wenn man die (einfacheren) Grundregeln von der Bronzezeit schon durchgespielt hat. Auch als Solo weiterhin gut spielbar (gleiche Regeln wie im Standard Spiel), und natürlich machen im Solospiel auch die Schiffe zum Handel (Austausch von Waren) Sinn.

I've played Through the Ages a lot and really enjoyed it. Combining Through the Ages with King of Tokyo rolling mechanics seems like a sure thing, and it was pretty fun. I made the mistake of forgetting that the game ends once five developments are made, so I was caught off-guard and lost by a large margin by someone who had played the game quite a bit. Still a fun game and I'd like to try it more. I'll likely buy the iPhone app as the one complaint I had on the game was the components and paper score tracking.

I like that this game is as much a competition with yourself as it is with the other players.  I don't think it's possible to talk about the game without comparing it to Yahtzee, but this game clearly has more going for it.  Interaction opportunities, sure, but also playing the odds and trying to make the best choices for your game.  The components are great - I love all the wood.

Initial rating, based on playing once. Interesting dice game, with obvious parallels to Pandemic: The Cure in dice distribution and re-rolling decisions. Didn't convince due to high impact of luck factor (I just did NOT manage to roll any food). Wooden peg boards were kinda cool, but the wooden dice are entirely too large and clunky.

What a wonderfully little dice game this is. The game comes with some really nice wooden dice and goods boards, along with a ton of pages and a short rules sheat.

It has the typical Yahtzee-style double re-roll mechanics de rigueur for these games, but it imports some features from its bigger games to give this filler some weight. For example, RttA adds on some slight engine building elements with the construction of new 'cities' (=dice) and developments.

Definitely worth seeking out.

Egész jó kis kockajáték! Nagyon távolról emlékeztet a TTA-ra, de kb. osztva 1000-rel:) Játékidő 10 perc/fő. A szabályok nagyon egyszerűek, mégis más súlycsoport, mint mondjuk a Cosmic Wimpout, vagy a Knizia Decathlon. Pedig kellék ehhez se kell sok: a 7 egyedi kockán kívül az igényes kis fatáblák a jelölőkkel minden játékosnak, és a jegyzettömb, ahol a pontokat vezetjük. A játék a komolyabb civilizációs játékok butított imitációja. Itt is építünk, etetünk... A fejlesztések biztosítják a varianciát, a katasztrófák megoldása nagyon jó (főleg hogy az ellenfeleket is sújthatja). Az áruk elszámolása kicsit a '80-as Civilization áruira emlékeztet. Nem biztos, hogy 100 parti benne van , de szívesen leülök bármikor játszani. 
Igényes a kivitel, de még ezt figyelembe véve is drága. A segédlet ill. a pontozólap nyelvfüggő, de könnyen lehet, hogy már fenn van valahol magyarul.

Igen fenn van magyarul, és a kiegje is, ami csak egy új pontozótábla végül is. Nagyon jó egyedül is!!

Very good dice game, involves quite a lot of thinking and planning-adaptation.  Several ways to scores makes the game really varied.  Components are certainly great, only complaint is my german version is really very big compared to the english one.
One really good point is that this game is somehow a system, so that just by changing the playing sheet, you may play a "different" game (as they have done with Late Bronze Age).
It surely involves some luck (it has dice, you know), but no lucky player will win if does not play properly.

NOTE: I got the Spanish version so I traded the german one.  But I kept the coloured pegs. :)

Roll through the Ages is the kind of game in which I walk away from the table when it isn't my turn.  The activity of rolling dice is sort of fun, but the same can be said for Yahtzee.

As far as the components, the dice look nice and the cribbage board is made of a nice piece of wood, but the same can be said for the wooden golf pencil included in San Juan.

Compared to Can't Stop and Yahtzee, I'd have to say that I like Roll Through the Ages the best.

Not terrible, but it didn't get my goat either.  One play.

I think my biggest problem is that I didn't look at it relative to what everyone else was doing---because I really didn't know.  That is, I could have been working to tempo the game a little faster and shut it down quicker.  ...or I could have made some offensive gambles.  I have a particular strategy I'm waiting for next time I play this.

Really nice wooden components.  A roll the dice, push your luck (a la Yahtzee/King of Tokyo) to get food and goods to feed your cities, build additional cities and monuments, or invest in civilizational developments which allow you to do things like re-roll dice, ignore disasters, gain additional food or goods, gain bonus points for each city or monument you build.  Wife really liked this one.

Excellent game for a light evening. It's easy to explain, the low interaction means you don't need to follow what everyone else is doing all the time (ie, have a conversation the side and you probably won't lose). Dice don't scare anyone.

...but, it does get pretty tedious. There isn't really a great deal of strategy going on. So while it's probably the best light civ building game I know it's not the best use of an hour.

I would say that this is a 'cute' game.  It's simple enough that pretty much everyone is willing to play it, yet it still has some interesting decisions, and a bit of flavour of the theme.

Despite the randomness of the dice, the games often [though not always] are quite balanced.  Definitely a good game for the price tag.

In the end this dicegame is of course down to luck. But it gives you some meaningfull tactical decisions in the proces and it even manages to capture some of the pasted on theme. You are always weighing your different possibilities after every throw of the dice and some of the choices are really tough. This results in a tense race to the finish feel. With all this the game still manages to stay light enough to be easily learned and enjoyed by non gamers and gamers alike.

This is a pretty decent Yahtzee style game.  It has a nice balance of mechanics that allow players to approach victory from multiple paths.  I'm surprised by how fast the game went once we understood what we were doing.  I also liked the way the disasters were divided, so that players could try for more in order to send them on their opponents.  There isn't a huge amount of player interaction, but enough that I find myself watching my opponents to see what they will do next.

Initial impression:

Seems like an okay thing - took far too long for how silly and random it was, but it does have a small amount of depth.  We might have played incorrectly, but there seemed to be a significant turn order advantage (1 > 2 > 3 > 4) - player 3 building a monument right before player 4, with no turn order compensation, is lame.

RATING: 5
A very clever game that just isn't that interesting.  It's of a similar vein to Puerto Rico and its ilk in that it has a limited lifespan built in where you are discovering how the special powers and game systems work and after that initial period it's not quite as interesting.  RTtA, unfortunately, does not even manage a respectable number of plays before the diminishing returns kick in.  I would say 5-10 plays and the various building interactions should be fully elucidated.

Of course, even understanding the strategies of the game does nothing to help you with the dice.  It's pretty clear that building a few cities is crucial at the beginning to get more dice.  If you don't roll citizens, you aren't getting a city and you are going to lose to someone that does.  It's that simple.  Variations on this theme crop up throughout the game and it really undermines the great feel of a deep, strategic civilization game that it has going for it.

My last complaint is the solitary nature of the game.  Some propose using trading rules to alleviate this, but that requires more players (I don't see much reason to trade with 2 players) which means the game is nearly proportionately longer.  More importantly, it's not clear to me that it is worth the effort to engage in furious trading for such a fluffy game.

Still, I am impressed with what was done here.  All the elements of a civilization game in such a short and minimal package.  I think it keenly lays bare just how much unnecessary chrome is welded onto the many popular civilization games here (I am of course looking at Through the Ages).

A pleasant and short Yahtzee-like game.  Seems to have multiple paths to victory.  The wooden "goods" charts are a nice touch... otherwise you just get dice and score pads in the box.

The implementation of this game is very good with the wooden boards, cool wooden dice (a little hard to read), and scoring pad.  Big kudos to the designer for releasing a new, more complicated score card for free as a PDF.  This game is a great value because of that.  The base game does seem to end up being a race to finish as early as possible which feels a shame... so the new score sheet aiming for longer games is a very welcome addition!

This is an excellent filler, especially appropriate for travel or taking a game out to a public place because of its components. The rules couldn't be simpler while you actually (especially with the expansion) end up actually creating an economic engine in a thirty minute game. This is the case moreso than with 7 Wonders, actually. It is a bit dry and quiet, but if you don't mind that, you are very likely to be very satisfied with how much game is packed into the simple ruleset and playtime. It's a thirty minute civ game you can take to the bar - a picture of elegance.

Roll a bunch of dice, maybe reroll some, fill out a spreadsheet and declare a winner.  I don't like the dice as they are huge wooden jobs with faint printing, and heavy enough with sharp enough corners that I have concerns about my tabletop. Plays well as a portable game on my iPhone though, and pretty fun solo in that capacity.

RATING: 6.5
For a filler game Roll runs just a tad too long.  For a brand new intro player to games the rules are followable, but probably not as simple as other gateway games.  I think it rather fits the role of a game that is designed for people to play just after being introduced to modern games.

There is definitely a mix of strategy and luck.  The worst part of the game is the very abrupt ending feel where you just get what you believe to be a good combo engine and the game ends almost immediately.

really awesome game that I had somehow missed playing till just now. Very great civ-like game (which I normally hate), terrific game speed, smart, but easy going enough that it's fun to talk and/or drink while playing. I hope I don't end up wearing this out, but I could see it getting dull after a ton of plays. Update: while I really enjoy this game, I was correct, it gets dull quickly. I sold my copy and got the new Iron Age version instead. I'd recommend getting that version right off the bat unless the people you game with prefer their games very very easy.

RATING: 5
Pretty much what you would expect from a dice game. Roll dice, put some to one side, roll again, put more to one side, roll a third time.

Interaction is very limited - but way its implemented annoys me, seems turn order gives an advantage to early players. You take your turn, roll dice, get stuff then turn moves on - but game ends as soon as one player hits the trigger, no attempt to give everyone an equal number of turns, so sucks to go later assuming 'equal' luck ...

Also monuments - first to finish one gets the main points, so again, better to be doing it before someone else. Oh and they didn't name them ... would have been better if they had - and had them as central tiles you took or something.

Colours are bad for those who are colourblind - I couldn't differentiate between the 2 'browns' nor the 2 'greens' :( 

All in all, 'ok' quite like the ideas behind it - just was hoping for a little more.

As a filler it works, but there's a bit of counting/consideration for spending your coins/wares which can slow the game down.

I'd play it, just in no rush to own it. Especially at the price, for a fiver, yes ... over 3x that, no thanks.

I enjoyed my first play of this and look forward to trying it again, but I do have some questions.  Can seven (or even six) cities be worth building?

Is it sane NOT to develop irrigation and medicine to protect yourself or are these must haves?

This game is my current *hot* solo game.  It plays solo in about 20 - 30 minutes without any of the long set up of Agricola.  While the strategy is less deep than Agricola (I think -- 'cause I haven't figured it out yet), it is definitely deep enough when added to the variability of the dice.  I haven't gotten anyone to play this with yet and am holding off on reviewing it until I do.  For now, I'm just enjoying it alone.

Keeping as my prime air travel solo game.

More Yahtzee on steroids than Civ Lite. Nice dice rolling game with a certain amount of planning possible. Different winning strategies seem to exist (development rush, monuments etc.).
Player interaction is present, as opponents' rolls may affect other players and there is competition in completing monuments faster than others.
The dice look nice and antique at fist glance but do not roll too well and the carvings are not evenly colored.

Build the greatest civilization by rolling dice. The solo game for the iPhone works great as a 10 minute filler. Playing the game in real life, however, feels more tedious and nearly not as satisfying. Caveat, I am terrible at throwing dice - two skulls in my first roll, four skulls in my last roll, and endless skulls in between. Needless to say, I ended in dead last place.

As a Yahtzee variant it's certainly better than the norm. But It's over too quickly and has nothing to 'grab' you. If I'm going to roll buckets of dice, King of Tokyo's much more fun. RttA seems to be too 'cerebral' for what is, at its core, a push-your-luck gambling-style game.

Really good for a little dice game. Although the theme is nice, it doesn't feel like building a civilization, it's just over too quick for that. It feels more like a victory-point-grabbing race than an engine building game, but that's okay for a short filler. It has enough different strategies to keep it interesting.

I really enjoy this game. I was introduced to it by a good friend (Bobby4th) back in Arizona, and purchased it as soon as my local game shop had it in stock...which took much longer than I would have liked.

Despite its resemblance (graphically and in name) to Through the Ages: A Story of Civilization, it has a very different feel.  Roll Through the Ages is obviously a much lighter game, and is certainly much quicker to play.  It has a bit of a press-your-luck feel without the frustration that something like Yahtzee might have.  (Incidentally, did Yahtzee pioneer the dice-freezing action, or is it simply the poster child?)

What I like about RTtA is that I have multiple paths to victory; I can focus on building monuments quickly, or I can focus on developments, or I can focus on a combination of the two.  In some ways, the dice will drive your strategy, but for the most part, you can decide on your own course of action.

The only negative (and it's not a huge one) is that there isn't a lot of player interaction, at least not out of the box.  In essence, the only things that can happen are that another player's disaster affects you, or another player builds a monument first (thus denying you points).  Not a huge problem, but don't go into this game expecting a ton of interaction.

Overall a solid game, and definitely one I'm pleased to have in my collection.

This is by far my favorite filler of late - perhaps my favorite of all time.  It's like Yahtzee if Yahtzee were much better (I won't say good, because I do like Yahtzee).  It's a quick game, and full of push-your-luck moments, but the decisions are informed ones, and there is plenty of strategy here.  Well, maybe not plenty, but certainly at least 4-5 viable paths to combining developments and actions for a solid chance at winning.  The components are sweet, and the box (with pad in bottom, like big soft cushion) becomes the perfect dice tray.  If you love dice games, this is a must-have, and the best "express" style game I've played.

Fun little dice game.  I like the tension between building up production capability vs. scoring points / ending the game.  If you fall behind on workers vs. your opponents and they've been building cities you can sometimes pull off a victory by buying five quick developments and ending the game before they have a chance to get rolling.

FRED loses points for build quality though.  The dice are difficult to read and some are faded quite badly.  The lamination is already wearing off some of the peg boards - and the game is brand new!

Quite the heaviest box for a mid-sized game 'evah'! Decent as a solo game it's better with a proper complement of players.  Interestingly, disasters aren't as bad as they sound - they're certainly not unmitigated.  Look forward to playing more.

And we now have - a lot - as the game plays quickly and well and doesn't overstay its welcome.  If anything it feels in a bit of a rush once you're used to it - so I was very pleased to see the addition of 'The Late Bronze Age' version and enjoyed playing with the new options, which made the game feel fresh again.  This is certainly a bit weightier than the standard game and gives you a bit more to think about but, for me, makes it a little too long with four.  Three might be better but I suspect the 'LBA' rules will shine brightest with two players and look forward to trying it that way.

To reiterate: I only play this game with trading :) I believe that the trading is central to the design here, and to play without it makes the game a little too frustratingly random and solitaire-y for my tastes; trading provides an important outlet to help players roll with the luck of the dice, helps to keep it at the 45 minute mark (or less) by making the game in general richer, and is an important factor in the balance between commodities and monuments. Originally, trading was not an optional rule; it was made optional at the publisher's request. I lobbied Matt pretty hard to keep it in the core rules, but I ended up on the losing end of that one. With trading, this is a nice, light-to-medium game with fun, flavor, and some strategy which I like quite a bit. Without it ... it's OK but too solitaire-y for my tastes at best and irritatingly overlong at worst.
---
I finally got to play the shipping version of the game (a bunch of my "Unpublished Prototype" plays are this game). As someone who was involved quite a bit in the playtesting of this game, I'm pretty happy with how it came out. There are a lot of moving parts here, and I was a little nervous the balance wasn't going to be quite right - getting the monument/commodity/cities balance right was tricky. But so far, I think it is. (I'm not sure I ever played the final final version before it was published, the game was moving around a lot during the development process.)

I think 3 is probably the sweet spot here in terms of number of players. That way, you can get some trading action, but there isn't too much downtime (personally, I would never play the no-trading version). There can be some AP, so watch for that. My feeling is that at 30-45 minutes it's a fun game, but some players will drag it out past that.
---
For the folks who have been following this game, I will offer up one little insider tidbit. It actually does have a relationship to Through the Ages, although not the one you might expect. As Matt mentions in the BoardGameNews interview, this game came out of a one-month Civilization Dice Game design challenge our little gaming group had (our games were crap, but Matt's was good :)). The idea of doing a light, fast, civilization-building dice game was actually a direct result of my extreme frustration with being dragged through another excruciating 6-hour game of Through the Ages, a game I decided I never, ever wanted to see again.

A really good die roller!  It's not often that you see a dice game where you can do much in the way of strategy, but there are multiple ways to score points here and the various developments really let you pick a strategy and go with it.  However, it is a dice game of course, so even the best laid strategy's success is at the whim of the dice.  A great game if you like dice rollers, and a probably a good one even if you don't.

Updated 11/7/10. 

[thing=37380]Roll Through the Ages[/thing] was another new-to-me game that I had high hopes for -- hopes that were ultimately dashed.  I had heard from several users that the game provided a reasonably short, lightweight, interesting dice-based experience.  Although I'm not the world's largest dice fan, I do enjoy having multiple tense, tactical [geeklist=23110]super-fillers[/geeklist] in my collection for weeknights with my wife: [thread=577318]Seeland[/thread], [thing=38054]Snow Tails[/thing], [thing=8051]Attika[/thing], [thing=35935]Day & Night[/thing], [thing=34297]The Climbers[/thing], and [thing=27173]Vikings[/thing] all come to mind.

The implementation of Roll Through the Ages fails on multiple levels, however.  First, there is a defined early strategy: roll workers.  Yes, I realize that's roughly equivalent to saying that the key to [thing=3522]LCR[/thing] is to [thread=433105]roll well and not roll poorly[/thread].  But players who don't roll workers early can't get extra dice, and there is virtually no downside to having extra dice.  In fact, it seems that the game's central struggle is between the players who don't roll workers early attempting to end the game quickly (which never seemed particularly viable) and the players who do roll workers early hoping to have enough turns to exploit their dice advantage (which seems much more common).  So: roll well and don't roll poorly.

[b]Random Off-Topic Rant:[/b]
[o]As a quick aside, I often complain about Eurogames being too balanced, so my complaint about the imbalance in the importance of various resources early in the game might initially appear hypocritical.  The difference is that Roll Through the Ages uses dice to deliver imbalanced goods to players randomly.  Most well-crafted dice games these days are about providing players opportunities to manage that randomness (Stone Age) or providing players multiple viable paths to work within the randomly imposed constraints (Alien Frontiers).  At least initially, Roll Through the Ages appears to do neither.  Instead, it dictates a single, viable early game path that depends on players obtaining a sufficient quantity of a randomly distributed resource.  This seems like poor design, and is substantially different from games that provide imbalanced opportunities for players to choose (or not) to compete over.[/o]

Perhaps in an attempt to mitigate some of the randomness I just complained of, Roll Through the Ages allows players up to three re-rolls, setting aside any number of dice you wish to keep in the process.  Yes, this is Civ-[thing=2243]Yahtzee[/thing].  The downside to this attempt at balance is that the game is so transparently calculable that anyone actively competing for a win has little choice but to succumb to AP.  This should be the gameplay description on the back of the box, just to warn people:

[q]Roll some dice. If you don't like them, re-roll as many as you want (except skulls). If you don't like those, re-roll as many as you want (except skulls). 

Between each of these rolls, calculate the best possible allocation of dice (using scratch paper if necessary). Then calculate the odds of increasing that tally by re-rolling any single die. Then calculate the odds of increasing that tally by re-rolling any combination of dice. The ask whether this is your first, second, or third roll. Then remember that you upgraded one skill so that you get extra resources. Then recalculate to account for this skill. Then ask whether this is your first, second, or third roll.  

Are you having fun yet?[/q]
People talk about some games feeling like a spreadsheet, but Roll Through the Ages takes that to a new level.  The thin veneer of theme does little to distract from the constant stream of boring little calculations necessary to decide how to allocate dice and which strategies to purse.  It's a mind-numbing endeavor when it's your turn, and when waiting for others in a 4-player game, you might as well just stand up, stretch your legs, grab a smoke, and maybe make a frittata.  It's going to be a while. 

Third and finally, despite all of the calculation required for smart gameplay, the (apparently theme-required) disaster mechanism is nothing more than a risk/reward push-your-luck game.  Sometimes disasters hurt you, sometimes they hurt others.  They (mostly) can't be re-rolled, so the player who is unlucky enough to roll a ton of them at an inopportune moment will lose the game through no fault of his/her own.  It's an unfortunate mechanic that feels tacked-on to the game because someone in play-testing probably argued vociferously that you can't have a civilization-themed game without random, soul-crushing disasters.  Designers should stop listening to that guy.  

All-in-all, the game feels like a low-budget, poorly-themed, solitaire version of a civ-game.  Unless you can't live without dice, there is nothing that Roll Through the Ages offers that [thing=42910]Peloponnes[/thing] doesn't do exponentially better in a similar time frame (including solo play!).

All-in-all an mildly unpleasant experience with little redeeming value.

Played with Tommy and Wendell during our lunch break.  Very simple game to pick up and get into.  Not a whole lot of player interaction.  Definitely one I would like to see be played more during our lunch breaks.  At home I would rather play Ra: Dice though. Rated 7. (12/11/09)

Love that we can play a civilization game in about half an hour. This, and the fact that heatehr enjoys it more than Ra: Dice raises this game to an 8 for me (3/12/10)

After 10 plays I see that I do the same thing every time (and that most peopel have only slight variants in what upgrades they go for.) This downgrades the game to a 7.5  (4/17/10)

[u]February 2010:[/u] I usually hate games with dice or too much randomness, but I figured a pure dice game might be ok to play as a fun game as opposed as a thinky game. Had a hard time convincing Laurène to try it out but once we did, she kept asking to play again. I myself am a bit less enthusiastic. I do appreciate the game and like what it does, however, there is one small thing I hate is the plague... This introduces too much variance in very similar rolls (2 skulls = penalty and 4 skulls = big penalty but roll 3 of them and you're hurting the other player...). Apart from that, I do have fun playing it and it is exactly what it is supposed to be, a quick filler with a civ theme that works well. I played 2 or 3 times with the late bronze age rules (except trading) and this was better, it seemed better balanced with more time to really do something of your civ while in the basic game it sometimes seems that once you've bought an expensive development, the game is over almost right after.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I knew it was a filler but I had still hoped it would be a nice little, light civilization filler. Well, it is, but it's also just kind of a yahtzee variant with not a lot of interesting decisions. A lot of dice rolling. Overall, I just don't find it that exciting and would probably spend the time on other games I like more and can be played in the same time, for instance Taluva (which has no similarities to RTtA by the way).

I am having a lot of fun playing this game.  It is finally one that I can play against my wife and actually win.

Randomness abounds, but knowing when to stop rolling, and what to buy and when is key.

However, this game can have a tendancy to slip into "repetitive" mode.  It is very easy to concentrate on the same Developments and the same Monuments each game - especially if you have the resources and extra time to do it.  So to really enjoy the game, you have to be a fan of "expanding your horizons".  

Getting the "Free Expansion" offered on the website can combat any "repititious" playing, as the number of Developments are expanded and revised from the original - definitely more "thinking" when you throw that into the mix.

One of my favorite dice games overall.

Decent dice rolling game.  The one aspect I really like is how each die has good things on each side that you want.  The re-roll is just a means to get the stuff you really want that turn.  But at the end of the day, its still just a random set of resources you get and you race other players trying to be the first to complete certain objectives with those resources.  It really is a solo game to 'get there first'.  I rate the base game a 6, but the trading does add a layer that makes this more of a multiplayer "game" instead of a solo experiment and that is much needed - boosting my rating to a 7.

Rated "7" after one play. Fun game! Reminds me of Yahtzee, but with much more enjoyable and tougher choices. This has the potential to be a fun game to play with my wife, with a relatively quick playing time. The components are absolutely wonderful and substantive. Cool dice!

Update: dropped this to a "6." It's just not getting played. I like it... I'm just not playing it. This might be a good game, though, to take on a trip. 

Update: well, finally traded this one away for Princes of Florence. I bought it to play with the wife, but she kept choosing other games. I've got plenty of other fillers, so though I think this is a decent game, I don't think I'll miss it. There's some nostalgia in seeing the updated version of Yahtzee, but even I found myself turning to other options. I'd be happy to play it, but I don't need to own it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
An okay yahtzee variant where you roll dice to get workers/food/resources all to convert into various points through various means. Pretty much everything turns into points beyond the food that you need to feed each of our dice each turn and the developments which also give you special powers, but this just felt really dry compared to games like Qwixx and Rolling America which do the quick pencil-paper game much better and Nations: Dice which does a civilization dice game with actual theme integration in my opinion. I would play any of those over this.

A solid game of light Civ building.  You don't develop an "attachment" to "your people, but you are presented with several decisions, and the whole package works well.  I have only played two player (6+ games) and not used the trading optional rule.  The "long game" is recommended as the standard game can be simply too short.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I'm thankful that you can play solo because this is very low on player interaction. The paths to victory to be few and I can't see a lot of strategic depth. There are some interesting decisions over wether to roll again or not but the decisions make them selves most often. I love the setup, the feel and the ideas and the first few plays are fun, but replayability is limited.

Even though I won my first game, my victory didn't feel terribly exciting. The player interaction in my three player game was minimal at best, with one player causing the rest to lose points once and the rest of the "interaction" being a mere race for monuments. Building the cities gave me a massive advantage since the other players were too scared of the food cost and the game was over in about ten rounds, give or take. But rolling the dice was pretty fun and I enjoyed allocating my resources. There were only a couple different strategies available which was somewhat disappointing, but it is a simple game, so I can't hate it too much for that.

This one works much better with 2p than 4p. The components are top notch, the rules are short and concise and the game plays quickly.

In a 4p game there isn't a whole lot of real interaction. With 2p, there is a lot more room for it.

I'm disappointed that some of the theme escaped by not naming the resources, the wonders, etc. It wouldn't have taken much more chrome in the rules/production to really grab hold of the civilization theme more strongly. They maybe overdid it in the simplicity department and left some theme behind.

The dice are chaotic, and bad luck can make all the difference....but its a filler. It really does do a good job of providing a light civ-building game with dice. I'd play it pretty much any time....but I also don't tend to care much for fillers, so opportunities are pretty sparse. I'll probably end up trading my copy in the near future.

I'm not really a dice game type guy, so take these comments for what they're worth with that in mind. RTtA is basically a dice snowball game. You start out with 3 dice, you roll the dice, and those rolls give you the ability to buy more dice which are then used to accrue victory points at the end of the game. Side issues include needing to keep rolling enough food to feed your dice (or face negative VPs) and the ability to invest in special powers that make your rolls better or generally make it easier to buy stuff. Another point of note is the skull sides of the dice which provide significant amounts of money, but which can be bad in quantity if you haven't bought preventative improvements. These can hand out negative points to you, though with appropriate upgrades, you can actually want some of them to come up as they'll affect your opponents instead.

RTtA is the perfect example to me of a game that does nothing particularly wrong, nor anything particularly right. It's nicely produced, and has some flashes of interest, but it isn't particularly compelling either. Workmanlike, but lacking a clever hook that would make me want to come back to it. It's the kind of game that I would play if others were eager, but somewhat reluctantly because of the surfeit of other, higher quality filler that's available. At 30 minutes, it's about 15 minutes too long for what it offers.

Aside: some people really like the added complexity of the Late Bronze Age scoring sheets, personally, I try to avoid them, as they make the game another 10-15 minutes longer. The base game with the LBA sheets rates somewhere around a 3.

It was quite a lot of fun playing this game, but what a
shallow excuse for a theme this was.  At no time did I feel like I was building a civilization or whatever, it was just an excuse to roll dice for points.

Nice meshing of fast play and medium light complexity, which made it a hit with my group and pushed my rating up slightly.  A lot of fun from simple components, though player interaction is pretty low; just the race element and pestilence in the standard game.  As a side effect, the solo version is decent enough, though.

When this game was announced, I didn't even bother to look at it during Spiel. Civilization meets Yathzee, that's the gist of it. While both games scratch a certain itch at times, I don't think the marriage of both ideas is a particularly fruitful one. Players throw a number of dice Yathzee-style, then do things with the values which turn up. Food is necessary to feed cities (which are 1:1 related to the number of dice you are allowed to throw); vases give you goods which allow you to purchase discoveries (and VP); little guys give you new cities or monuments (and VP); coins give you, well, coins for discoveries; skulls are disasters and usually cause point loss. It's all fairly simple and straightforward, and from what I've read, that's what Matt Leacock intended.

I have two problems with this game. Well, three to be honest, but number three is not an issue in practice. The first problem is that I dislike the way the game was produced. The cribbage boards probably were meant to add sturdiness to the proceedings so that the game became portable, but people with big hands will find them fiddly and small. In addition, the game is so multiplayer solitaire that you don't need to see what other people are doing, so why a simpler and lighter  solution was not devised (magnets!) is beyond me. Second issue I have that in the basic setup it can be over before you know it. The game [i]appears[/i] to be a multiple-ways-to-victory thingy, but in practice the goals are reached so quickly that this doesn't come to pass. I understand that Matt has released a longer version with altered scoring sheet for those who prefer their games to last a little longer. But still, it's unsatisfactory. There's quite a bit of stuff to keep track of, and it's over before you know it. Top-heavy ruleset, choices mean little, you name it, it all boils down to the same issue with this design.

RttA is not a bad game, but neither do I find it very good or engaging. It is simple enough to play with my mother, but I doubt she'd able to grasp the details, and that means it will probably fail as a family game as well. The rating hovers between 5 and 6: if my mother understands it it'll become a 6, otherwise the rating will stay put at 5.

The structure and mechanics of this game are really very clever.  I like the risk-taking of the skulls.  I like the varied step ladder for acquiring goods.  And the use of pegs and a board is special.

But my overall opinion for this game goes in 2 directions.  When it comes to the solo game (which I have on my iPhone), I'm fiercely addicted.  But when playing with others, it feels like the game is always over before it's barely started.  The winner is often the player who can force the endgame first, catching the other players off-guard.

That being said, I still want to keep playing this game and learn to get better at it!

WARNING: This game will be loathsome to the luck-averse.

It is a bit to luck driven for my taste and also the game ends way to fast, I think the game would benefit from lasting a couple of rounds longer. It feels like just when your civilization starts to get a momentum the game ends.

Definitely a better game than Yahtzee even for solo play. Even better with >1 players because: 1) you need to race to finish the monuments, 2) game might end before you accomplish your plan, 3) pestilence affect other players. Lots of ways to win. Better than King of Tokyo for 2 players.

A well designed game that suffers from little to no variability.  Sure the dice rolls are different each game but essential you can almost go for the same strategy each time.  If not that then there are about 3 (maybe 4) pre scripted strategies you should go for depending on how the dice roll.  Still a great couples game.  If you playing with more than 2 just get King of Tokyo/New York.

RATING: 4
A promising design whose actual implementation is lackluster and forgettable. The game is barely interactive, and it ends so quickly that there is hardly time to begin a strategy much less implement it. Feels severely underdeveloped and poorly thought through, especially the end conditions. Given that is also doesn't give much a "feel" of developing a civilization, there's little to recommend here.

RATING: 7
Components: Quality, sturdy dice, despite being wooden. The peg boards are functional. The score pad, though cool, could be re-ordered a bit to better match the sequence of a player's turn. My copy was missing a few pegs when I opened the box, but the publisher sent me replacement pegs immediately; great service.

Experience: Very cool. Everything I like about Yahtzee-like dice-rolling games, but also with a tableau of increasing powers. The length is good; it's over soon enough that every turn counts. Every roll is useful, too, making it fun and interesting to see what comes up, and then work with what I have.

I rate this game for what it is, and not for what it does not try to be.  It is a lightweight game meant to capture some of the flavor and decision-making found in other civ games that take much longer, with many more components and a larger footprint.  And as that lightweight game, it is an unqualified success.

I would have preferred that the dice be made of the resin/polymer/plastic-whatever material that you find in higher-quality dice, with the icons being in greater contrast to the die color, and being a better fit for the hand of someone not in the NBA, but that is pretty much my only reservation about the game.

I would like to see some expansion dice, with other options.  I think this game system is ripe with potential for such things.

Bought it for $36.99 at Comic Readers in Regina, on Albert Street.  Not much at all like the boardgame Through the Ages.  A 20 minute game for up to 4 players.  Some interaction between players, never for anyone else's benefit though.
Excellent wooden boards, pegs and dice.  Lots of scorecards included.
There are expanded rules online that offer differ wonders and advances, using the same game components.  It's a good variant, and is also sold separately.

This is a simple Civilization game with WONDERFUL bits and can be played quickly with up to four players. I've only played the single player variant and was quite pleased. A cheat sheet for the various monuments and developments is included but I would advise a trip to the copier for the rest of the players.

This light dice-rolling, empire building game is about as much fun as you can have with a piece of paper, a pen, some wooden dice and a peg board.  Looks pretty bland at first glance, but it plays really well.  Only played solo and as 2 player, but would love to see what changes when you add more players.  Plays quick and is quite fulfilling for a filler game.

This is a great idea for a game. Take some dice, a cribbage board to keep track of points and a paper score sheet and get into it. The base game plays in 30 minutes and the PnP version about 50% longer than that. I like making decisions about a path to take through the options and seeing how it plays out. So, great bits and great game play. Take it to a bar, order a beer, and start rolling. You'll have a crowd around you in no time.

I played several games of this solo when I first got it, and I really enjoyed it.  I thought that maybe that would be the form of play it took on most often.  However, once playing it with others, I see that the game is MUCH better than the solo version.

There's nothing new here. This isn't a "civilization game". This isn't at all related to the game Through the Ages. There aren't decisions and paths to victory. It's a fancied up yahtzee type game. It's just luck of the dice rolls and push your luck. There's nothing interesting about the game. If you roll better, you win. Chances are high if you don't roll what you need to get additional dice early in the game, you lost. Wow. Such a great game.

The only thing these clunky wooden dice are good for is bludgeoning yourself to death to escape having to finish the game.

RATING: 6.5
Brilliance lies in its accessability.  Fills the void of a light civilization game that can be learned by anyone and played within probably a half hour.  Uses dice, but Yahtzee-style rerolls allow for better manipulation of results.

One issue I find is that it's always a good play to grow your civilization ASAP (i.e. increase your number of cities, and consequently, the number of dice you get to roll). Because of this, all players are doing the same thing at the beginning, and it comes down to who rolled more workers (workers are needed to expand cities). It would be nice to see a viable alternative to this standard opening.

I'd almost always rather play Ra: The Dice Game over this.

Clever application of theme to a push-your-luck dice game, but in the end it's still just a push-your-luck dice game.  Cool as those big wooden custom dice are, it's ludicrous to pay $30 for this when one could pick up the marginally simpler Monopoly Express for under $10.

On the plus side, I managed to Yahtzee SIX skulls on six dice (4 on the first roll, 2 on the re-roll), which was quite memorable.  :)

EDIT:  I was taught the game verbally and didn't know that there were optional rules for trading.  Those might make the game a little more interesting.  I'll try that when I get a chance.

What I liked:
* A themed and slightly more complex version of Zilch.

What I didn't like:
* Bit too slow for what it is and no real meaty decisions to do.

Overall
It looks like it has more choices than it actually does and I don't feel like playing this one any more than Zilch or Greed. Experienced players will be aware of better items to go for at various stages of the game but that is about it.

Another in the "silly dice rolling game" category, but with a heavy borrowing of Civilisation's developments and principles. The population, food, economy & development are well integrated resulting in the guts of an empire building game, but still very simple to learn and play. Easily played mindlessly at the start or end of a gaming session, but can be played with a bit more thought applied to strategy.

RATING: 7
Two of your favorite euro mechanisms rolled, so to speak, into a dice game: (i) obtaining differently valued resources and then exchanging those for victory points and (ii) periodically feeding a growing population. The dice add to the usual amount of luck in such games, so the game is fairly light and suitably quick.

RATING: 7
Likes: Light, fun, quick to learn. Plays fast, and has a quick set up time. Components are well made. I like how it utilizes the peg board -very unique. A nice blend of luck with dice rolling, and strategy. Do I use my workers to get a quick lead in monuments, or build more cities so that I can roll more dice? Plenty of fun decisions.

Dislikes: After two plays it seems like it could be "solve" after a few more sessions. I feel like there is a route that could be taken for a maximum chance to win each game.

I have to change my rating after I played some more games of this one. I guess, my expectations were just too high in my first games. This is not really a civilization game. It's more a game in which you try to get the best result from what you've got. Once I approached the game with this mindset, I had a lot of fun. It's a nice little filler!

[2010-09-22 Rating: n.a.->6]

This rating is mostly based on my plays of this game on Yucata.de, but I've also played the german version released by Pegasus.

SUMMARY
--------

This is a light civilization game using dice as the main mechanic. Each round you throw as much dice as you possess cities (three in the beginning). After max. three tosses of your dice, the dice determine what you will have available in this round:

- Workers: These allow you to claim more cities or built monuments. The later ones are mostly built as a source of victory points (VPs), more cities grant you more dice.

- Food: Each round you need to have as much food as you have cities. If you have less, you get -1 VP per cities you can't feed.

- Coins: Each coin symbol you see on your dice is worth 7 coins. You can use these coins to built a technology that allows you to break the rules or to give you a scoring bonus. Example: There is a technology that let's you re-roll one die at the end of your turn, another technology gives you one VP per city you own.
Each coin you don't use at the end of your round is lost.

- Wares: Each ware-symbol on a die give you one ware. You can stack them for a maximum of six wares and trade them in for coins later. These can be used to buy technologies.

- Skull: Skulls can be bad and good at the same time. For one, each skull you roll gives you also two wares. This is great, but you can't re-roll any die showing a skull. After you have thrown all your dice for the third time or you passed, you count the number of skulls you rolled. If this number is higher than one, someone, well mostly you, get's punished. The skull mechanism is also the only source of interaction within this game. Roll three skulls and your opponents lose three VPs. Roll two, four or five and you lose 2 or 4 VPs or all your wares.

The game ends after one player has bought his fifth technology or each of the available monuments for that player count has been built by a least one player. You count your VPs and the player with the most of them wins.

COMMENT:
---------

* This is a light beer&pretzels game. There are some valid routes to victory and there is some fun in discovering them. The game plays very quick (~10-15 minutes), but the interaction is quite low. All in all, this is a nice Yahtzee variant with some "push your luck" feel to it. I would play it, if nothing better is around, but I would not suggest it.

I just found my new favorite Travel Game to replace Pass the Pigs!  More than just a press-your-luck dice game, it incorporates strategy as well.  A diced Euro - what a concept!  A couple minor issues with the components - I received a 1st Ed. copy, and the dice are a tad on the light side, and can be difficult to read.  Also, several of the scoring pegs are very similar in color, which makes them hard to tell apart, especially in poor light.  But the overall quality of the components, and the nice tactile feel of the heavy wood dice make up for that.  This is a great game.

RATING: 5
I'm not a big fan of this style of dice game.  It's fun as a solo endeavor for a while, but it takes too long between turns when you're playing with 4 people (just like To Court the King).  The problem is that there is not enough interaction for people to pay attention in between turns.  It's the same problem as Yahtzee.  Knizia tried to mitigate this problem with Pikamino by introducing some player interaction.  Alan Moon made it so that all players played at the same time with Diamant (which I think is the best solution).  Roll Through the Ages has a little bit of interaction, but there is still no reason to pay attention to the game when it is not your turn.  So people start goofing off and talking and forget to notice when it is their turn.

I also feel like the majority of my score rest upon whether I roll people early in the game.  Any game where I get three dice with people on them for the first turn will be a good one.  This seems like a design flaw.  With Yahtzee, every turn is equal to every other turn, so it doesn't matter if you get unlucky early or unlucky late.  Getting unlucky early in RTtA makes it so you don't want to finish the game. 

Anyhow, I think RTtA is ok as a solo game, but there are other games I'd rather play with any other number of players.

RATING: 4.5
Probably an amusing diversion as an app but not quite enough there or enough fun for face-to-face play - also a bit too much down-time when played with four. I can see that the production was aiming to be a simple dice, pencil and pad game so why add the crappy peg-boards in and make it a £24 price tag - oh yeah, it's by Eagle. For that kind of price point I would want better dice, building templates for the players and monument tokens and some cubes, and throw the wooden peg-boards for card and some cubes.

The game itself is worth an extra rating point but the price v production costs it.

Whomever rolls the most workers early wins. The second game I did not roll any workers for the first 2/3 of the game. I came in last. The guy who rolled the most early workers came in first. The guy who rolled the second most early workers came in second. The guy who rolled the third most came in second.

Extremely unlikely I will play it again.

RATING: 6
Players roll dice and check off goals on their reference card, simulating the development of a civilization.  The title of the game is a pun on the fabulous Through The Ages, but the similarities end there.  This game is a Yahtzee spin-off, where players get three rolls, and record their results on their peg board (recording food and goods), and then spend that stuff on maintaining their "cities" (i.e. dice) and purchasing extra cities, monuments and advances.  Nicely produced and a good compact size, but leaving you with a "that's it?" feeling after a couple of games.  Very expensive for what you get (i.e. cheap wooden offcuts ... dice, board, pegs).

A solid offering.  It was described to me as "[thing=2243][/thing] with meat" ... and the meat IS tasty.  Afterward, I found myself thinking how this is the perfect cabin/camping/family game.

However, with this one, I have a sneaking suspicion it would be repeatedly requested.

Great little dice rolling game, that uses the basic Yahtzee premise of rolling dice and marking sections off your scoring pad.   The skulls are an interesting push-your-luck element that is built into the mix, because if you can get enough you can hurt other players rather than yourself.    I'm not crazy about the large wooden dice or the overall production of the game, but it's quick and fun to play.

Get "The Late Bronze Age".  It adds more variety and strategies, and doesn't end the game as quickly.  It also doesn't have the feel of "too much work for too little reward."

RATING: 7.33
Fun, light and provides an "epic feel" in a small time frame.  Interesting use of dice...I don't mind the randomness...unless I roll 5 skulls...

Whenever a player is taking their time, my brother-in-law likes to say: "Here we are again, strolling through the ages."  A nice lighthearted way to say: "Don't think too hard about your move"...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Good game for what it is: short, dice rolling civ game. Does give that civ game in ten or twenty minutes. However I think the game ends too fast to make the developments any useful other than the points. So it feels like the end of a game where people are just grabbing points instead of building stuff that can be of any use during the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Tricky game to discuss - it looks fairly boring from the outset. A player takes the dice and rolls them several times, and ticks a couple boxes while everyone one else waits for their turn to do the same. And in many ways, it is that boring.

But there is a certain fun to the tactical decisions involved. Do you go for extra dice or monuments? Which monument to go for? Are you able to get away with so little food production this turn? While this is enjoyable, these elements of fun are likely explored better in other games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Decent, quick civ building dice game. There's not enough time to really do some cool development combinations, but this is mitigated somewhat by playing to 7 developments instead of 5 before the game ends.

A bit to abstract and infected with Eurogame sensibilities that ignore the importance of war and diplomacy amongst players. War is abstracted out to be "Disasters" but not mentioned as such. Bronze age Kingdoms did a lot of fighting and killing and conquering, as well as building and trading. The problem, of course, are the players who instead of building will go and attack and attack and attack to get their resources. So instead of coping with a mechanism to limit such gaming behavior they eliminate it altogether. Otherwise a nice dice game with nice bits that is a bit overpriced.

TRADED IT! (for Ground Floor)

This was the one game to fall through the cracks of my rule; "Every 8 rated game I ever played, I now own." I believe I just played it too much early on, that I never needed to revisit it all these years later (and my copies faded dice always irked me).

The game really is one of the best "Yahtzee" style dice games out there. The wood board and pegs really add to it's classic feel. It does suffers from downtime with 3/4 players, but is otherwise an extremely solid design.

Roll Through the Ages is a good dice game, but more so it's a classic 'how was this not done before?' game. A dice game with a development chart, genius! What Leacock really did well was the goods development and income generation. 

So why a 6 for a game I obviously respect? Can't Stop. I simply find CS too perfect to seriously consider Can't Stop. If you find yourself looking for a game that has some luck elements, but is a little more strategic than CS, I would recommend taking a close look at RttA.

Yahtzee killer. There are multiple paths to victory BUT it seems early in the game building cities is the best option. The developments provide some fun special ability combos.

(As of [b]12[/b] plays) A dice game with a decent civilization-building theme and great wooden components. The solo game is a fantastic diversion, particularly suited to traveling gamers. The multiplayer game lasts somewhat longer than it should, but its familiar connection with [GAMEID=2243] greatly increases its ability to work with non-gamers, and the civilization-building theme is quite accessible.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
A filler that's a civ game with dice? As long as you're not expecting a sumo wrestler the size of Through the Ages: A Story of Civilization, and judge the game on its own merits as a dice-rolling filler game, Roll Through the Ages has to be commended for offering a genuinely civilization experience packed into 30 minutes. There's a basic tech tree, there's interesting choices, there's tension, and there's a high fun factor. A big thumbs up!  
The game ends quickly, I recommend playing up to 5 developments with 4 players, 6 developments with 3 players, and 7 developments with 2 players.
See my comprehensive pictorial review here: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/380167
Also don't miss the [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/375374]solitaire high score challenge[/url] - my highest score is 93.  My personal best for regular solitaire game is [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/3120183#3120183]74 points[/url].

Note also that the designer has released a free print-n-play expansion which tweaks some rules and adds some developments: [gameid=47389]
See my complete overview of this official variant here: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/450175
Main changes:
● Game ends with 7 instead of 5 developments
● Four new developments (Preservation, Smithing, Shipping, Commerce)
● Adjustments to the cost and point value of five other developments
● Adjustments to the cost for monuments, which are all in play (even in 2-3 player games)
● Trading is standard

A neat little exercise and a fun game, though the complete lack of any military element makes it a poor civ game.  I enjoyed the solo variant as it's a solid push your luck game, and I'm not sure how much the multiplayer version would change due to the near-complete lack of player interaction.  

Beautiful production, though, which is nice to see from FRED.

EDIT: OK, the multiplayer game definitely does add a bit to the solitaire variant, which I already quite enjoyed.  Bumped to an 8.

6/12/10  I picked up Roll For The Ages for the iPhone. I see what all the fuss is about and I've still only played solo. Fun and addicting!

9/21/10  I'm really enjoying my new game group. I think the solo iPhone version of Roll Through the Ages has hurt me when I play face to face.

I don't get this game. It feels boring, and with silly rules - why can't I reroll a hazard die? It lacks the great interaction between and theme and play mechanics that permeates other great Leacock games (Forbidden Island, Pandemic...)

RATING: 7
Roll Through the Ages: The Bronze Age is a nice and light 2* to 4 players game about the development of ancient civilizations.

Being based on dice rolling it is influenced by the blind lady's whims, but there's no room for complaints: as games last around 15 minutes, any bad luck is just a good excuse to play one more game. And then one more, if it clicks for you, as it's a game that can be very satisfying and might produces the just-one-more-turn (game in this case) feeling typical of many heavier turn based strategy games (like Civilization, Masters of Orion, and so on).

At the beginning of the turn you roll your dice (and re-roll some, up to a maximum of two times) to see which resources (grain, workers, coins, goods, or disasters) are available. You invest your resources into cities (your engine, each city giving you one dice to roll), developments (which give bonuses and points) or monuments (which score you points), and the game is over at the end of the turn when a player has purchased his 5th development or all monuments have been built. I like this, as it allows the players to set the game's speed: you might try to close a game you're leading or lengthen one where you have some catching up to do.
Developments cost money, which you get from coins and by selling goods; most developments are worth the investment (in around 50 games I have taken all of them at least once, with granary being my least bought development) and either give you a bonus or protect you from bad effects (droughts, pestilence, revolts).

Many strategies are possible: you can focus on workers and monuments, or goods and developments, or a mix of the two. You can play aggressively (getting many disasters/workers and neglecting to feed your cities), or carefully (trying to avoid VP penalties); you can also try to roll pestilences to damage your opponent. Monuments give more points to the first who builds them, so "stealing" them from under someone else's nose might be worth a few penalty points (for not supplying your cities with food). Consequently, when more than two players focus on monuments, the game will end sooner and someone going for developments might have a slight advantage (as the others are battling for the same pool of points).

In conclusion, this is a nice and fast game with a good amount of strategy thrown in. Recommended as a light filler, avoid if you hate randomness.

*: The solo game didn't work for me. The dice remove a good deal of the puzzle-like appeal that solo games usually have, and the lack of interaction makes it completely insipid and dull.

This is a very solid game in more ways than one.  You could run over it with a truck and the box would still maintain its shape.  This game does a great job of giving a civilization-type feel in an experience that can take only a half hour with 2 or 3 players.  There are several aspects to setting up your civilization: feeding them, gathering resources, researching new technology, building monuments, and even potentially some occasional disasters.  It's a fairly engaging solo game as well.

Fun game.  But the ongoing reminder from the player who taught me and the other two players was:  Don't forget to feed your cities.  Good advice.  I just wish the game could end with more than just 5 developments.  Oh well.  Just tried playing a solitaire game (me vs. me) and realized that it's alot more fun playing against other players (preferably at least two).  Played it again today (2-14-2010) with Mr. Billington and won.  But found it's alot more fun with two or more other players.  Played it with two other players and definitely more fun with 3 than 2.

Pretty much a multi-player solo game which I normally don't care for, but this plays short enough for that not to matter much. New players can be slow to pick-up how the goods work (discard down to 6 icons). I think 1-3 players is probably max, it may last too long with 4 unless all play really quick (read: down time between turns).

Games with a race to bonus pts -- like the monuments here or the region tiles in Thurn and Taxis -- are starting to bug me more and more. I've played too many games where the only discernable difference between the play of the winner and the loser was that the winner went first. In RTTA, the start player is gonna beat you to the 10 monument, so you grap the 8, and so on. At the end of the game, they grab the 2 and 1 pointers, and you get 1 and 0. Not to mention that the start player is less vulnerable to Pestilence. I can't for the life of me figure out anything in the set-up or game mechanics that helps mitigate this significant disadvantage.

Roll Through the Ages is mostly a glorified version of Yahtzee. There are a few rules changes and additions that give players considerably more influence over their rolls (and it basically never happens that you just have to forfeit an entire turn just because you rolled something you have no use for) but all things considered it's still Yahtzee.

I would describe this game as a tactical version of Yahtzee. By rolling the dice you will build your own civilication. The choices you'll need to make during the game will determine what kind of civilication arises.

Luck will always play a part with Roll through the Ages because the game involves dices. But as a player you can influence the dices (you can choose how many dices you want to roll, by building, or you can develop the skill to re-roll one of the dices each turn). 

Roll through the Ages is a game which we play very often. The game is ideal to play in between games or as an ending of an evening. Also the game is very compact, perfect to take with you on vacation.

Two and a half years after purchase, I finally sit down to my first solo game. It actually a bit of fun, a Yahtzee civilization game assisted by nice wooden components and a theme that works well. There is now also an iPhone app, but in this case, i find the actual physical game is a more enjoyable diversion because of the component touch and feel. The rules read suggests this might even be better as a multi-player game. Not a classic, but with implied multiplayer fun, I rate as a 7 (8/8/13). UPDATE Just cant see how I would bring this out to my gamer group (Rating 6.462 Jan 17)

Not one of my top favourite dice games, but definitely an interesting one made good by the variety of developments that are available.  This is something I haven't seen in a dice game before! Otherwise, I find everything else in regards to getting points fairly standard. All in all it is still enjoyable, but I don't think it feels like there is much to discover after repeated plays. While there feels to be a good amount of decision making to have, I really feel like I have the game down pat and there isn't that much room to try different strategies. The "push your luck" nature of the game is what is best, but there's a lot of games that do something similar like this already. As dice games go, I can think of a few that I like more than this one, so I'm not feeling compelled to keeping this one around. Some neat ideas with the developments, but overall a game that I don't feel invites multiple plays to any great depth.

First off, I love the pegs and the little boards for this game. Any homage to Cribbage is a positive in my book. The dice could have been better produced and the iconography isn't very clear. Having said that, this is a fun little game. Deeper and far more interesting than the Catan dice game and not as long as To Court the King which can drag out a little. Strangely this game reminded me of how much I enjoy Monopoly Express. It's certainly different, but both scratch the same itch. Fun game.

This game is like Yahtzee made to new level. Although I won in this game, actual game result is very dependent on successful dice rolls. At the beginning of game just roll workers as fast as possible to get more dice and also food to feed your "dice". Then just buy certain developments which helps you a lot, for example, the one which gives +1 food per die and then one which gives +1 worker per worker die. Game is quite short and strategically, tactically not deep at all - there are not much options to do or tough decisions to make.
I would recommend this game for those, who like Yahtzee, but want something more deeper and not so random as Yahtzee.

Roll Through the Ages is popular with some of the members of my gaming group, but it just seems like a super-fluffy, autopilot type of game to me.

The decision to release this for the iPhone sounds like a good idea, since it's really just a solitaire game in disguise.

The limited good choices for the beginning of the game made it quite repetitive for me. Also, I tend to calculate the math behind each option before making a decision, which made me win most of the time. It turns to be to mathematical to me. After this game I realized I prefer games with more conflict and less mathematics/probability involved, especially if involving hidden/uncertain information.

It's a game that is largely determined by your dice rolls and the game ends right when you get your civilization up to snuff.

Despite that, I really like it.

RATING: 7
There isn’t much civilization feel to this game, but still it is a quite clever game with more tactics than you would expect for a civilization themed Yahzee variant. It is not only to hope that you get a certain result, but also take into account of what you are going next and which developments to aim for. After 20 plays or so, it gets a little old though.

A game my wife and I both enjoy.  Mildly luck based, a bit of strategy, short, and consistently a LOT of fun. Plenty of decisions and a real feel of accomplishing something as the game progresses. Easy to teach. Cool large wooden dice. Really great filler, learned quickly, played quickly, and has enough strategy to be fulfilling.

2009 acquisition.  Will roll this one out soon.

Great filler with limited footprint.  A kind of push-your-luck plus build-your-engine type dice game.  I can see this being the perfect game for the long flights.  However, there may be limited long-term staying power of other games.

The only reason it is not up for trade yet is my wife and son still play it.

Really good civ-building dice game. The robust components suggest this would be good pub-fodder, too. It's surprisingly satisfying in the "add stuff to your civilisation" stakes. What I really like is that, with fewer cities, you can mange things quite well, but with several cities, your civilisation becomes a powerful behemoth that's more than a little out of control, making for a thrilling ride, and oddly convincing as a (heavily abstracted) model of running a kingdom.

First there was Yahtzee.  Then there was Yahtzee with a purpose.  Actually, the comparison to Yahtzee isn't even that strong besides the fact that you're rolling dice and choosing what dice to re-roll to get the most ideal outcome.  However, instead of scoring for each individual roll, you're using the resources on the dice to build the most illustrious civilization.  My one complaint about the base game being that players were rarely (never) able to achieve as much as they would have hoped before the endgame conditions were met.  Luckily, a P&P expansion is available through the geek that adds new elements to the game and lets it play out long enough to really explore deeper strategies.

RATING: 8
Initial rating after 3 solo plays:  What a great, light game!  This game succeeds in cleverly mixing dice rolling with the civilization-building theme.  At least in the solo variant there is much less luck than it seems to be.  This game has everything a civ-lite game needs: workers, resources, cities, disasters while the dice add the neccessary but not too large random factor.  

Will add more comment after our first group plays.

Downgraded this from an 8 to a 7, and now even lower, as I feel the game has pretty limited replayability. It's great fun and cleverly put together, but once you've worked out certain optimum strategies (which doesn't take long) it's more down to whose dice come out best than any real tactical or strategic cleverness. Traded away. (Played lots more on iPod and Yucata.de, unrecorded)

Not exactly an original concept, but seems pretty well-executed. The faces on the dice combined with the amount of re-rolling means you actually can set out to pursue a certain path to victory without getting harmed by chance too often. There are lots of options of what to buy and the choices are easily understood. I wish it could accomodate more players. It also does seem to have some odd pacing issues. It seems to drag early on and then quickly ramp up to breakneck speed with tons of buying for about one or two rounds and then ends. I'd really have to play more to get a better handle on it. Rating could go up.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Despite my famous dislike for dice games, I like this one and want to play it more!  It's probably because it's a civilization-type game, and I do like that.  It gives me that "increasing population and developing civ advances" feel that I like so much, without the length of Advanced Civilization or Through the Ages.  Actually, this even blows Tempus out of the water because it has no stupid Conversion cards (or other game-changing randomness) -- yes, I know how silly that sounds given that the whole game is random, but at least there's a way to mitigate the bad effects by buying appropriate civilization technology.

This game is also similar to Ra the dice game because of the skulls (which are like suns and can't be re-rolled, and which cause disasters), and because of the monuments which are mostly just for VPs, not for useful benefits (other than the Great Wall).

There is a rule that is important and easy to miss -- if you sell any good to buy a civ tech, you have to spend ALL of that good (moving the marker back to zero).  This makes things much simpler in terms of calculating which goods to spend when buying tech.  Spoilage (dropping down to 6 goods) doesn't work this way; you can lose less than a whole row of goods if you choose.

As with most people, I think that 5 civ advances is too few, and causes the game to end too quickly.  7 might be a better number.  Or maybe it should be like Advanced Civ where a certain point total ends the game (but that would require too much calculation).

RATING: 6
Well... it's not bad, but I find myself comparing it unfavorably to the Ra dice game. That game has the great central scoring board, which is absolutely crucial to generating player interaction. Instead of following the opponents' rolls to see how they compare on the various tracks in Ra Dice, players are generally just watching their own little thing here, rarely taking an interest in each other's rolls. With individual score sheets, Roll Through the Ages feels very much like a solitaire exercise. Meanwhile, helpful upgrades like Medicine only lessen what interaction is there by making you immune to other players' actions. It's not bad by any means, and I like a dice game like this from time to time, but Ra Dice is just so much better.

Yahtzee with ressource management. Interesting.
I really disliked the big brother of this one.

But this game i'd play from time to time. Once everyone understands the main strategies i plays quick & still feels a bit meatier than most other yahtzee clones.

Hitting the others & protecting yourself is nice.. i have the feeling though that this strategy is superior to just building monuments, for you need a lot dice to finish those and usually only get points and no extra ability.

After many more plays from my previous comments, I've come to realize luck doesn't play as large of a factor as I thought before.  Sure, if someone gets exactly what they need all the time, they'll probably win.  But there's always a use for half the dice.  It's not as though you will get absolutely nothing if you roll badly.

The different ways to piece together developments is interesting along with the pacing that the other players can cause.  You can go for a big machine of high developments that get you an immense amount of points, but if someone else is content going for a quick sweep of low points/short game before you reach your goal, it's an interesting chain of decisions to take into account.  The utilization of goods is nifty and overall this is my favorite dice game.

Especially considering it's fun with a wide range of people, this is a solid game.  I still don't quite feel right giving it a 10 along my others, but this is at the top of my 9s.

Roll though the Ages- Yahtzee meets Civ, in a fun way.

There's not much more to say here, because truly the 'theme' is merely the sets one tries to accumulate.  There is a certain amount of player interaction with certain combos, and in choice of die application, but mostly the luck of the bones will select the winner

Not an everyday game, but fun enough whenever it comes out.

This game is pretty fun as a 1-player endeavor every once in a while: try to beat your top score in 10 turns. I've played this game with up to four people also, which (to be honest) was pretty awful. Too much downtime waiting for others to try and figure out which dice combination they would like to keep. There is basically one dice combination that effects other players and can be easily avoided with the Irrigation development... which everyone always develops and then the game has NO player interaction. It becomes a solitaire game where players compare scores at the end = dull. The game still went quickly... a bit too quickly, as one player always seemed to hit the 5 development goal within the first 5-7 turns, which usually ended the game on the 1st or 2nd players turn, allowing them one extra turn than players 3 and 4. I think this game is best as a 1- or 2-player game.

The less sophisticated, shorter version of its bigger brother. While I haven't played the longer version, this dice-rolling version is mildly interesting. It's Yahtzee on steroids, I suppose. Roll some dice to get resources and workers, to turn them into developments and monuments. Developments help you fend off disasters which can occur with rolling the dice. Seems straightforward, but the 3P game ended far too quickly. Could it be a good filler? I don't know--I'm now intrigued to play its bigger brother soon.

Update (08/17/10): I am convinced that I should stay away from all "roll this and roll that" adaptations of good games. The abstraction and resulting "stupid-ification" annoys the hell out of me. I will never play this again. Downgrading to a '4'.

Update (1/26/11): Who am I kidding? Never going to play this again. It's a '2'.

An oddity in being an engine game that you play by rolling dice, with the randomness in the result forcing each player down a different path. OK, apart from the rule about the game ending when one player has 5 Developments, this ends the game far too soon, just as it's getting interesting. I normally bang on about the virtues of short games, but this could have, and really should have been 45mins+. I understand that the 'Late Bronze Age' update goes some way to addressing this, but I haven't tried it.

En breve: un juego de forzar tu suerte tirando dados con una temática de civilizaciones. Un Yahtzee con tema que une dos conceptos antagónicos: filler y juego de civilizaciones.

Durante la partida, cada jugador va anotando sus elecciones en una hoja a tal efecto. Se tira 1d6 especial por cada ciudad (se comienza el juego con 3 ciudades = 3 dados) y se puede relanzar dos veces más, aunque los dados que muestren una calavera no podrán lanzarse de nuevo. Obtener una calavera únicamente no es dañina, pero más de una puede llegar a serlo, lo que se traduce en pérdidas de PV´s por lo general. 

El resto de las caras de los dados muestran qué se obtiene: el trigo sirve para alimentar las ciudades (1 trigo x ciudad o -1PV por ciudad sin alimentar). Las monedas sirven para comprar descubrimientos durante tu turno (no se pueden guardar para turnos posteriores) y los recursos, de los cuales hay 5, sirven para comprar  progresos. Los progresos no son más que ventajas que permiten a los jugadores poderes especiales o saltarse las reglas en forma de excepción, además de algún PV. Por último, los trabajadores sirven para fundar nuevas ciudades y tirar más dados el próximo turno o bien, construir monumentos que dan PV´s

PROS: de algún modo, el juego es un sistema de juego, de modo que si cambias las características reflejadas en las hojas del juego, obtienes un juego distinto, algo que se hizo con la expansión "Late Bronze Age".  Con la suficiente dosis de estrategia para estar un pelín por encima de juegos como "Piko Piko" o "Risk Express". Versión en solitario en la que hay que conseguir la mayor puntuación en 10 turnos. Dados de madera pirograbados en bajorrelieve que confieren a los componentes un aire de primitivismo acorde con el tema.

CONS: Reglas de almacenamiento de recursos un pelín difíciles de entender. La expansión traducida fanmade es mejor que el original si se busca más profundidad. Sin la variante comercio, el juego carece de interacción. 

En definitiva, simplón y repetitivo... pero no olvidemos que es un filler para jugar haciendo tiempo hasta estar todos los jugadores en una velada o en una tarde lluviosa de domingo.

Decent Yahtzee style game that plays quick.  Upgrades are neat, but you'll probably find yourself repeatedly going for the same ones. Non-offensive, but not something that really interests me at the end of the day.

A friend described Roll Through the Ages as "very functional." He didn't mean it as a compliment, but I have to agree with him on some level. I enjoy playing solo, but the 10 turn limit and ability to wipe skulls remove a bit of the tension.

Roll Through the Ages is an entertaining light filler game.  It uses dice in a Yahtzee mechanic that may be allocated after being rolled to direct the advance of your civilization in one of many areas(on a pre-printed score sheet just like Yahtzee!)  The dice also can result in a disaster like a flood or a drought or famine that hurts your score.  Some of the disasters strike all the other players as well.  The game amounts to a race to the endgame conditions and maximization of scoring by wise dice allocation choices.  With dice being involved, there is a significant degree of luck in this game.  It must also be noted that there is extremely limited player interaction.  Overall, it is a fun, light game that plays in a short stretch of time.

RATING: 2
"Yahtzee" or "Ship, Captain, Crew" with record-keeping.  What an awful game.  I suppose if you were drunk, and tripping on 'shrooms, and developmentally challenged to begin with, it could be an interesting way to kill some time in a completely mindless way.  I mean, sure, it's okay if you're into games like "Yahtzee" and "Monopoly", but then:  why are you here (on BGG, not Earth)?  People who say "It's like Civ, but it plays in 20 minutes!" are stupid.  It's nothing at all like Civ.  IT'S YAHTZEE.  You just. roll. dice.   Then roll again.  Then roll again.  Move pegs.  Check boxes.  Roll dice.  Kill self.

RATING: 10
Mar09: This one really does accomplish what it sets out to do.  It's a short game with plenty of interesting decisions.  Some of them even long term (well, 20 minutes long term).

There are different paths to try.  You can rush the monuments.  You can build waaay up to 6-7 cities.  You can sort of go development crazy.

This really is the fun thematic dice game I've been looking for.  For now, it's better than Can't Stop and Monopoly Express both.

As far as game length goes, I'm not yet crazy about the 5 development ending.  I know other people have played around with upping that limit.  I think I'd consider messing with just a flat turn limit.  It would take away some of the uncertainty about when the game will end, but I figure you'll still be struggling to complete exactly as much as you can anywho.

July09: Late Bronze Age Update

This game goes all the way to almost 10.  With 2 players, it probably is a 10.  With more players, I just don't think the trading does enough to keep it from being boring not on your turn.

Really though, the expansion is awesome.  It adds more depth, more strategic paths and just that little bit more game time.  You really feel like you can make a plan and ride it all the way to the finish line.

Returned to this after a few years away.  The base game is still bleh, but the "Late Bronze Age" is still awesome.  I'm bumping it up to a 10.

Wow, I had heard good things but really this was better than I expected as I didn't expect much for a pure dice game.  It actually feels like a game, even though your just rolling dice.  

Nice and simple rules, though the dang goods on the board were a little tricky, but overall pretty easy to teach so suitable for kids, familys etc.  Having said that, I found that playing with gamers the game still kept us interested and its fairly short and doesn’t overall stay its welcome.  It feels like your choices will matter, though going for cities (extra dice) early seems obvious and likely a must do strategy so it takes a little of that away.  (getting guys is too powerful?)

I was surprised too how much the theme actually came out, you kind of have the tech tree effect there, you have to feed, etc.  Luck is not that big a factor I found either, for a dice game, you do get 2 rerolls if you need them and there are a couple other little ways to help.  One of the better dice games I’ve played, especially where rolling dice is the whole game and there are no other accompanying mechanics but I do wonder/think that an optimal strategy would present itself after a few games.

Fun little dice game with a cool peg board for tracking your resources.  You're trying to build cities (which determines how many dice you roll), developments (which let you modify the rules for yourself and also give you points), and monuments (which give points to the first two to complete them).  Highest point total wins.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.75
Even though  you are competing to build momuments 1st and against time if another player wants to trigger the game end, it's basically multi-player solitaire.  And of course there is a big luck factor.  Downtime between turns also sucks. Reminds me of the Catan Dice Game in all those ways.

However it was enjoyable on my first play, not sure it would stand up after repeated plays.  I won by a large margin having built just two momuments (and 5 developments though I wasn't the one who triggered the game end) and by having only a handfull of disasters (final score 42, next two players tied at 30, and last was well below that).

Initial Rating: 7.0 (April 2010)

It´s an ok game. At first I ranked it better as I liked the game much more before but nowadays I only play it to advance ranks in Yucata. It was one of the first games I played. The play time is generally short and you have a lot of options through the game, still I find the luck to be annoyingly high (it is a dice game after all). I think the game is great for beginners as the rules are very simple. My main problem with the game is that I found myself taking the same path game after game so for me it has little replayability.

The components are top notch. 

Current Rating: 5.0

Nothing has changed, not only I always take the same path, this path is clearly superior to other paths (I won’t name it here because I don’t want to spoil the game for you) so I have to downgrade its rating. If two or more players follow this path, it is luck that defines who wins.

It is a good idea, but the game is unbalanced.

I have played it a lot on Yucata because (nowadays) I usually win so it is an easy way to advance ranks, but this is not a game close to my heart. If it weren’t for Yucata, I would play this once a year if that.

Nicely produced Civilisation themed dice game. We've had some good dice games of late (Kingsburg, Airships) and this is another one. Good mix of mechanics that capture some of the flavour of Civ board games and give the players some intersting decisions to make - there seem to be a number of strategies open to the players.

It's also nice to see a Civ game that doesn't last as long as the Roman Empire!

This might be my favorite of the Yahtzee-esque dice games. Which isn't to say I love it, but I do enjoy it and there seem to be some more interesting decisions than there are in King of Tokyo (for instance). I'm struck by the fact that I am almost always pretty happy with my first roll of the dice. The only reason I ever re-roll is if I need food or I rolled a coin and don't have enough money to buy a development. We'll see if that stays the same. I'm hoping it doesn't, just because the rolls seem more like card draws without that push-your-luck tension.

Update: All of the above holds true, but the more I play, the more I realize that dice games like this one just aren't for me.

Roll Through the Ages is a fun, well-designed dice game. Fair amount of strategy and decision making for a dice game.

Great dice game with several paths to victory. It's nice and quick to play, which may be a partial negative. It ends just a little too early for my liking - just when everyone's strategy gets going it's over. Still, there are many strategies to explore so perhaps my opinion will change as I learn the game more.

A pleasant dicefest game of push-your-luck/yahtzee type mechanics to build a multi-faceted thriving civilization.

RTtA es un mini juego de civilizaciones, en el que por medio de dados consigues los recursos necesarios para hacer progresar a tu civilización.

Juego entretenido al que se juegan unas partidas muy rápidas. Precisamente esta velocidad es lo que hace que se pierda un poco su concepto original, un juego de civilizaciones no puede durar tan poco, ya que tampoco te llega a dar la sensación de estar construyendo algo muy grande.

Las maderas para llevar el progreso de las civilizaciones son geniales.

RTtA is a small civilizations game, you will have to get the resources for your civilization's development through dice rolling.

Nice game, you can play it in a short time. For me, the problem of the game is its speed, you can not play a civilizations game in such a short time, you are not feeling your empire is really growing.

The wooden score boards are really cool.

This game has rapidly become the "good, quick filler" game of choice.  Not much interaction except for Pestilience and beating out another player to one of the monuments.  After the first few plays, the player who built up his/her cities quickest always won, but more recently I have seen players win with just five cities, pushing the goods/coins to get to five developments first, before the monument/city builders can take advantage of their position.  Thus, there appear to be multiple paths to victory and this bodes well for replay value.

Wow - a civ-light dice game which works!  Nice technology 'tree' ... there are no tech prerequesites but some techs work well with others.  The theme-ing is solid.  Some downtime with 4 players and the trading aspect of the game is pretty much ignored in most of my games.  Could be more direct conflict.  It IS fun and it IS short.  Perhaps its biggest strength is that the game is not TOO complex or 'busy' - Fantasy Flight games take note.

RATING: 5.5
Very fun game, played both the board game and iPhone app. Love the mix of strategy and tactics. This is due to the core mechanic revolving around dice. You want to have a solid long-term strategy and go in every turn with a goal. However, if the dice are not rolling your way, you need to alter your plans short-term to at least maximize your current turn, since some elements don't carry over very well (goods, coins and skulls). Randomness increases the variety of viable strategies, since you have to balance between flexibility (the ability to leverage any dice rolls) and risk (specializing in a certain path and looking for a restricted set of rolls)

I'm baffled by the existence of the game. 

Roll Through the Ages is preposterous on its face. It's a "civ game" in which you collect resources, grow your population, develop innovations such as agriculture and masonry, and complete ambitious "wonders" like the Pyramids. Games like this are usually thought of as "streamlined" if they clock in at 4 hours or less. RTtA takes 20 minutes. Yeah, laugh it off. Your turn also consists primarily on rolling a set of dice up to three times (guffaw). The thing is, the game packs a reasonable amount of strategy as each player races to complete the developments and the wonders. And race is the right word: what you've got here is another quirky income-to-VPs gear shifter. The goals are tired but the mechanics are fresh, and the throwback quality of the pegboard and scorecards didn't hurt. Don't pass this one up.

RATING: 7
Could've been a very good filler. I wouldn't go so far as to call it broken, but to me it seems that the game isn't balanced. There is too much to do, and the game ends too quickly (if played agressively). I've played it a lot woth my wife (who is an agressive 2-player gamer), and it often ends up being a race to be the first one to complete 5 developments. Hence, a lot of the things you can do is rendered meaningless. I think that the expansion "the late bronze age" fixes a lot of this, an is a much better game.

Just doesn't stand up to repeated plays for me, traded away.

I Liked:

I Disliked:
* Nothing changes or is accomplished in the game. i make some ticks, you make some ticks we roll dice someone wins. Dull
* Component quality is poor
* Game is over too quickly - there is an expansion to alter this, but you just get going and it finishes.

I really, really enjoy this game. (Maybe it's the peg boards that bring me back to playing games waiting for breakfast while on road trips as a kid.) I really dig the civ-building aspect and the theme.

But... (and there's always a but) I find it hard to bring this game out. It seems that people don't want this much strategy or options in a dice game, or conversely they don't want this much dice in a strategy game.

However, when the stars align and I get the chance to play this game, it's always a good time.

After playing it a few more times for the qualification round of the German boardgame championship 2014 downgraded to 6/10 again. With competent players it's too random to be fun on a competitive level. There are a few strategies to be learned but the dice mostly determine which one to take and if it works out.
---
Online play at Yucata.de revived my enjoyment of RTTA. Upgraded back to 7/10. The fast online play helps.

Works ok for the whole range of players (1-4) but the more I play the less I want to play. As with fast food, it leaves you a bit unsatisfied afterwards. Too bad that it became the filler game of choice in my main gaming group.

Maybe the best dice ever because they look nice and thematically seem ancient. Most of all they don't sound headache-inducingly loud when they are rolled, which is very important for a dice game. I wish more games would learn from this.

The strategy is definitely there, and the game fires on most all engines for me. It's easy to teach, play, and actually gives me the feeling I'm guiding my civilization (though this may not be true for everyone).

Not a bad little game, it seems like there are multiple paths to victory, thus separating it from other dice rolling game.  The rules as written don't seem right, as it is difficult for me to see how a game wouldn't end with 5 developments almost every time.  My first impression would be to increase the number of developments to end the game, or to play a fixed number of rounds.  But I assume that these ideas were shot down in playtesting for some good reason.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
The "goods" are a little confusing at first.  We muddled through it and verified with someone who had played it right that we were doing it correctly halfway through.

Good, but seems short.  Only 5 technology improvement.

Played a second time and it still just seems too short.  I don't see how one can avoid the strategy where you make a development each turn, pestilence the other players, and take the starvation points if you have to.  Odds are you'll only starve one or two cities.   Monuments seem almost never to get built.

I'd like to try some things like: up the number of developments,  if you stave a city too often it goes away, pestilence means you don't get goods, skulls only produce one good, or also a number of monuments must be built before the game ends (ie five developments x number of players + 3 monuments * number of players).  

More interaction between players would be nice and I suspect the trading rules + a longer game might encourage it.

Nice little dice rolling game. I often struggle with games based on dice rolling...as I suck at dice rolling. It's true. The dice hate me. Nevertheless, this has a nice spin and doesn't feel too much like "hey, who is (un)lucky today"?

A little more depth than your typical Yahtzee-style games, but it still lacks any spark of brilliance that makes it stand out. Players roll dice and attempt to balance between food, workers and goods to achieve multiple paths to victory.

RATING: 6
Feels like Yahtzee with a storyline. I like the game, played it only online so far but I imagine there's a significant added value in real life, actually rolling the dice and seeing the disappointment on your friends faces when you roll multiple skulls and give them negative points. The developments feel somewhat limited, although there are almost 20 of them. The more you play it the more you realize it's rahter superficial. Great fun, but don't expect too much strategy or depth.

Very quick setup, fluid turns with interesting decisions behind them. Like in [thing=8217][/thing], you are constantly improving, building up, gaining abilities based on your decisions. It's psychologically satisfying that way. There are attacks built into the die rolls, and the one-builder limitation turns the monument building part of the game into a race, so that keeps it from being multi-player solitaire. Good game.

A good entry in the dice-roller genre. More and tougher choices to make than in, say, Yahtzee, and with a theme that's not just pasted on - it really does work, in its own way. A little heavy to bring out for total non-gamers - the resource storage and accumulation rules are a little tricky to get the hang of at first - but with a little patience could even work out for this crowd.

Like many games, this one ends just when it seems like it's finally moving forward. Ending through all monuments being built is much harder to achieve than one player acquiring five technologies. Easily fixed with house rules, of course, or by using the PnP "Late Bronze Age" expansion.

This game combines so many elements that I enjoy all with one of the earliest game mechanics I learned as a kid. Dice rolling.

A game I believe that you can introduce to your family and rest assured knowing they will be that much more interested in board gaming.

I like this  Yahtzee variant but I am not too sure how it should be played.

In the game I won I was last player and played very quick 4 developments. In turn 8 or 9 I saw that if I was able to buy a fifth one I would win. (I think I only decided twice not to invest in a development)
So I am not too sure about it.

Several games.  Initially, I felt the games were fun, but...  I'm not sure the game is very strategic.  Basically, roll the dice, then make the best of the payoff.  I suppose one could say that about most games, but I didn't feel like I was planning my civilization much, but simply going where the dice led me.  The down time was a bit steep too, but I think that could be reduced with another set of dice.

The idea of the game is interesting, but the game falls a bit flat. There is like something missing and I cannot point it out. Also the game ends without tension at a moment you do not expect. There also not really a specific goal to achieve. You try to do stuff that makes points and hope to have more than the others at the end.

The production value is very weird, you have beautiful wooden tiles with pen and paper.

Components are beautiful.  The game is enhance yahtzee but with perhaps a few more decision and a bit more interconnectedness between some of the monuments and technologies which grant special abilities.  Game felt too short in some ways as 5 techs are developed very easily and quickly without much thinking about it if desired.  Seems like two paths to victory exist - either push the monument building with workers or push the technology tree with resources.

Would be an 8 if there was any reason to have other players at the table. A multiplayer game is simply several solo games where you compare scores at the end. Still, a nifty idea.

Dropping my rating from 6 to 5. There just isn't much of a multiplayer game here.

ADDENDUM: The "Late Bronze Age" rules definitely make this a better game. Add at least 1 to my rating for those rules, possibly 2 after I play it more.

EDIT: Ugh, no, a 5 is still too high for this.

Generally my wife has not been a fan of dice games---she tends to think they're too light strategically with not enough decisions.  While I had enjoyed [thing=35503][/thing], she was not a big fan.  Still, I was intrigued by [thing=37380][/thing] particularly due to the civilization theme.  We ended up getting this as one of our Secret Santa gifts and we gave it a try.

The components are nice, chunky wood bits and I like the peg boards.  However, the game didn't do much for us.  It was somewhat pleasant to roll the dice and to gradually tally up your pegs, but there feels like even less interaction here than in [thing=35503][/thing].  It felt very multiplayer solitaire, almost too much for us.  While the game has a civilization theme, it feels more like tallying checkboxes on your memo pad.  The game didn't feel tense enough for us and the starving and disaster mechanism didn't feel punishing enough.  My wife found the game boring, although she wasn't very disposed towards dice games in the first place.  I prefer [thing=35503][/thing] over this, as at least there is the central board that the players are competing together on.

RATING: 7
Dice games are the new new thing in euro design, and they're pretty hard to do well. The crux of the issue is that gamers like a measure of control and meaningful decisions, while dice are about pure randomness and, if they aren't designed around carefully, can easily subvert your decisions, rendering them meaningless. That or else the dice are so lifeless and meaningless that they may as well not be there. While Roll Through the Ages doesn't completely solve these problems, it does find a decent balance among them, and aside from the classic Liar's Dice it is among my favorite dice games.

It compensates for damping down the luck of the dice (which it does by making dice faces results, not numbers) by adding on a couple of small but interesting side systems for developing technologies and building wonders. While there is one "whammy" result, it is balanced by granting a couple of resources, as well, and depending on how many of them you roll you can nerf the result, too. The one really negative thing that can happen is failing to roll workers in the early rounds, putting you behind the other players in dice. While falling behind 6 dice to 5 is not a big deal, being behind 5 to three is hard.

Player interaction exists, but is a little thin. The first player to build a wonder gets more points than the second, and one of the "whammies" affects your opponents instead of yourself, but that's about it. To maximize this, add players, but there's not much to do during other players' turns, so diminishing returns set in fast. I'd peg 3 as the sweet spot, with 2 playing well if you're okay with solitaire-ish play. At 30 minutes or so I can happily overlook the low interaction, though. I'd rather keep downtime to a minimum and play with 2 or 3.

While Roll Through the ages isn't in the same class as Ra and (balance issues aside) Saint Petersburg, it is a bit faster, so it has a nice niche in most eurogamers' collections, even if it is not a must-buy.

Quick dice game with a Civ feel. Maybe a bit too short. It seems that the game ends always when your engine starts to be rolling! It is strange to say for a dice game but it is very thematic.

I give roll through the ages: the late bronze age (free expansion to this game) an 8.  This game is over too quickly, the late age rectifies that issue.

RATING: 8
This is a clear winner in terms of number of plays and I retain a fondness for it. Initially, we played it a lot, all player numbers, including some time on the solo game working out the best score possible. A year on, it retains its value. If you want a short game where you build stuff, make use of different special abilities, which you then use to make points, you have that here. The weakness of the game are the dice of course (you can't get around the randomness there) plus the feeling for some that it is over too fast. A determined player can end it quite quickly, before (as a friend put it) anyone else gets a chance to play. The free expansion fixes this, making it longer and less of a sprint, with additional developments to explore as well. Though it does then lose its quick game aspect somewhat, so the base game is sometimes what you want. A favorite.

This cool game occupies a pretty unique spot on the landscape, about halfway between goofy press-your-luck dice games of the YAHTZEE variety and deeper Euro-style civilization builders. 

It's not for everyone - there's nothing especially novel about its mechanics of civ-building that hasn't been done a zillion times before, and if you hate dicefests it will probably drive you extra nuts. But for a lightweight Euro-fan like myself who has always found Yahtzee to be far and away the least objectionable amongst Stupefying Americam Mainstream Parlor Games (let's call them SAMAPS) it will hit quite a few sweet spots. Profoundly teachable, too.

This is fun and highly addictive dice rolling game with a civilization theme.  You have to roll dice up to thee ties that can provide food, workers, money, trade goods, x2 trade goods with a disaster.  You use food to feed cities and workers to build more cities and great wonders.  You use trade goods to advance on tracks which when sold give you more money to buy technological advances, like leadership.  You want lots of trade goods but not too many in that you can get disasters.

I find the game very fun and there is a little interaction too in that some of the disasters affect other  players.  It has resource management and press your luck.  I like the game a lot and very fun solitaire as well.  The iPad app works well but does show its age.

這是個有關建設古文明的擲骰遊戲dice game。遊戲中有7個獨特的遊戲骰，另有4塊木製的記錄板以記錄糧食food 及5種財貨(木材wood、石材stone、陶器pottery、布匹cloth、矛頭spearhead)。玩家輪流擲骰生產糧食及各種財貨、勞動力。勞動力用以建城市及奇觀。積累的財貨用以換取文化。建設古文明間，亦會迎來各種災難。
玩家在其記分表上記錄各自的歷史成就。遊戲結束時，總分最高者勝。

遊戲開始前，玩家分别拿取1張記分表及1枝鉛筆(自行準備)，並各取1個記錄板及6枝不同顏色的柱狀標記。6枝不同顏色的柱狀標記，其中除糧食food的位置是3外，其餘5枝分别代表木材wood、石材stone、陶器pottery、布匹cloth、矛頭spearhead，皆插在行列中最左方無數字的位置上。

任意選擇1名玩家開始遊戲。開始遊戲的玩家先在其記分表的角落劃上「星」號作記認，然後拿取3顆遊戲骰。

遊戲以回合進行。每回合玩家依順時針方方輪流進行1個玩家回合。所有玩家皆完成1個玩家回合後，1回合完結。

玩家在其玩家回合中，依次進行下列5個步驟：

1. 生產
玩家在記分表上每建有1個城市city，即擲1顆遊戲骰(開始時每人皆有3個城市)。
首次擲骰後，擲出骷髏的骰子必須保留並旁置，然後玩家可在餘下的骰子中保留任何骰子，而重擲其他骰子。玩家可選擇保留所有骰子而直接收取財貨。
重擲的骰子中，擲出骷髏的骰子必須旁置。然後玩家可在所有非骷髏的骰子(包括首次擲骰後保留的)中，選擇再重擲其中任何骰子。玩家可接受擲骰結果直接收取財貨。
再次重擲骰子後，玩家必須依擲骰結果收取財貨。

遊戲骰的6面分别代表不同結果。
3禾：每有1顆骰顯示這面，玩家在其記錄板最下方糧食food一列，將標記往右移3個位置(即多了3個糧食)。玩家的糧食達到15即不可再增加。
1壺：每有1顆骰顯示這面，玩家即收取1個財貨goods。財貨必須先計算總數，然後才決定種類(見下文)。
2壺+骷髏：每有1顆骰顯示這面，玩家即收取2個財貨goods。財貨必須先計算總數，然後才決定種類(見下文)。若多於1顆骰顯示這面，玩家即需於步驟2迎來災難。
3人：每有1顆骰顯示這面，玩家即可於步驟3中，在其記分表上的城市city或奇觀monument劃去3個格子。
2禾/2人：每有1顆骰顯示這面，玩家可選增加2個糧食，還是在步驟3中劃去2個格子。多於1顆骰顯示這面，玩家可分别揀選不同的選擇。
錢幣：每有1顆骰顯示這面，玩家即可於步驟4中，換取1項知識技術時其代價降低7。

玩家依擲骰的結果收取財貨時，必須計算所得財貨的總數，然後才依木材wood、石材stone、陶器pottery、布匹cloth、矛頭spearhead這個次序，由下至上再上至下反復逐一增加。
例：玩家拿到共3個財貨，即會得1木材、1石材、1陶器。
例：玩家拿到共6個財貨，即會得1木材、1石材、1陶器、1布匹、2矛頭。
玩家的財貨以標記所在位置代表。每取得某項財貨，該標記即往右移1個位置。若桌財貨的標記經已移至最右位置，玩家即失去該個財貨。標記下的數字，即該數量財貨的價值。

2. 災難
玩家每有1個城市city，即扣減1個糧食food。若玩家的糧食不足，每缺少1個糧食將扣減玩家1分。減分以記分表下方災難disasters一欄記錄，每扣減1分即劃去1個格子。

檢視玩家擲骰所得的骷髏總數，以決定災難的效果。
1個骷髏：無災難發生。
2個骷髏(旱災)：除非玩家擁有灌溉irrigation，否則扣減2分。
3個骷髏(瘟疫)：所有對手扣減3分，除非該玩家擁有醫藥medicine。
4個骷髏(蠻族)：除非玩家建有長城great wall，否則扣減4分。
5個或以上的骷髏(起義)：除非玩家擁有宗教religion，否則失去所有財貨good。若玩家擁有宗教，則所有對手失去所有財貨(除非該玩家同樣擁有宗教)。

3. 建設
依玩家擲骰所得的工人數(人仔)，玩家即可於其記分表上的城市city及奇觀monument中，任意劃去相同數目的格子。任何「2禾/2人」的骰子若已取得2個糧食，即不作工人論。
玩家若在1個城市city或奇觀monument上，劃去其上全部的格子，即完成該城市或奇觀。
完成1個城市，即以筆圈上該城市上方的骰子圖案。下回合玩家即多得1顆遊戲骰。
完成1個奇觀，即以筆圈上該奇觀的分數。所有玩家中首名建成該個奇觀者，取較大數字的分數；後來者取較小數字的分數。
例：甲共得5工人。甲花3工人成為首位建成金字塔(3格)，得1分(後來者將無分數)。餘下的2工人用於建城市，甲在其第4個城市(3格)劃去2格。

4. 文明
玩家可以財貨goods換取1項知識技術。記分表上成就developments一欄中列出共13項知識技術。最左方數字為其代價，跟著是名稱、分數及效果。
玩家擲骰所得的每個錢幣，皆會得到7點的折扣。
玩家若以某項財貨支付代價時，必須扣減所有該財貨。遊戲中不設找贖，超出的數值即會浪廢。玩家可以多項財貨支付代價。
例：甲有2木(價值3)並擲得2個錢幣(折扣14)。甲需全數扣減2木，方可換取農耕agriculture(代價15)。

5. 庫存
玩家最多只可保有6個財貨goods。若玩家有多於6個財貨，即必須自行選擇扣減那種財貨，直至只保有6個財貨。

遊戲持續至達成以下二個情況之一，則完成該回合後，遊戲便即完結。即記分表上劃有「星」號者右方的玩家，完成其最後的玩家回合後，遊戲便會完結。
a. 某1名玩家換取了5項知識技術。
b. 所有玩家的奇觀，每種奇觀皆已建成最少1個。

遊戲完結後，玩家即在其記分表上計算自己的總分。加上成就developments的分數、奇觀monuments的分數、知識的獎分bonuses的分數，再扣減災難disasters的減分，即玩家的總分。總分最多者勝。總分相同，則以其中財貨goods總值最多者勝。

知識技術
領導leadership：步驟1中完成擲骰後，可重擲1顆骰(骷髏亦可)。
灌溉irrigation：免受旱災影響。
農耕agriculture：每收取「3禾」或「2禾/2人」的糧食food時，多得1個糧食。
採石quarrying：生產時一旦得到石材stone，多得1個石材。
醫藥 medicine：免受瘟疫影響。
鑄幣 coinage：每個錢幣得到12點的折扣。
商隊 caravans：玩家略過步驟5，可保有任何數目的財貨goods。
宗教 religion：起義時將禍害推予他人。
糧倉 granaries：步驟4中，玩家可用任何數目的糧食food來支付代價。每個糧食的價值是4。
砌石 masonry：步驟3中，每顆骰提供工人，皆作多1工人論。例如以「2禾/2人」用作工人時，即當作3個工人。
工程 engineering：步驟3中，玩家可扣減任何數目的石材stone以作工人論。每1個石材作3個工人論。
建築 architecture：玩家每完成1個奇觀monument，額外多得1分獎分。
帝國 empire：玩家每有1個城市city，額外多得1分獎分(即3~7分)。

3人遊戲：
遊戲開始前，劃去記分表上奇觀monument中的空中花園hanging gardens(11格)。

2人遊戲：
遊戲開始前，劃去記分表上奇觀monument中的神殿temple(7格)及大金字塔great pyramd(15格)。

1人遊戲：
遊戲只進行10回合，玩家目標為挑戰最高得分。
災難中瘟疫將扣減玩家3分，除非玩家擁有藥物medicine。
步驟1中，容許玩家選擇重擲擲得骷髏的骰子。

交易：
玩家們可自決是否加入交易規則。在步驟2後加入交易時段，玩家可與其他玩家交易糧食food及財貨goods。其他玩家間不得進行交易。
玩家可自行決定交易內容及次序。例：先3木換2石；再以3石換2陶。

For a long time I thought I wanted to own this, but after playing it that desire has gone. This is not a bad game - in fact, it's a perfectly serviceable dice game, but it's just that. The components are lovely to hold and look at, and conceptually the theme is cool, but they don't make a huge impact. It doesn't feel like I'm playing a civ game, it feels like I'm playing a Yahtzee variant. The dice are a bit bigger than is comfortable to roll too. The game is reasonably fun, and works fine as a filler, but (and maybe I'm spoiled here) I've come to expect that even filler games can offer a good amount of strategic depth, so I find this game somewhat lacking.

Update: Ended up buying the game anyway.

I'm not engaged by the civilization-building veneer at all, but the engine/customization is more interesting than most pure dice games, like Choice, Yahtzee, etc.

I'm surprised that I like the wooden dice.

I like this game. 
First got it on my iPhone, and I must say, it is almost addictive.
The "wooden" version plays a little slower, but I expect this to be the travel game of this summer. Easy to bring along, the game play is easy to explain to newcomers, but it is still involved enough to be interesting.

RATING: 8
Another addition to the welcome trend of shortish games that offer varied decisions and strategies within the space of an hour or less. Like Yspahan, it does not offer up all possibilities within the first games, and the temptation of trying out another development combo next time makes this a game you'll probably play several times in a row.

Nice components, too.

Anyone looking for a fast, portable game that plays from 2 to 4 players. For a light dice game this has some real depth and tough decisions.

RATING: 7
Simple dice-based civilization game for 1-4 players. 7 wooden dice are used as in Yahtzee to produce food, goods, workers and coins. Workers can build cities or monuments, goods and coins can be used to finance developments. Many of these provide special abilities as well as victory points. Progress and scoring is done on paper sheets provided with the game.

Interesting game, but not overly more complex than say triple Yahtzee despite what all the "too good for yahtzee" haters would have you believe. You roll dice and try to shoot for certain faces to come up, you then deal with what you get and decide where to put the results. I do like it and it certainly is more complex than most dice games, but it's still just a dice game.

I think my biggest reason for not running out and buying it straight away is the price. It's pretty lavishly produced and thus expensive for "just a dice game". I dunno if it's really worth it.

FUN: just using these great components and imagining your civilization grow, makes this game a step up from most dice games.

UNIQUE: just trying to create a civilization game with dice that plays in 15 minutes is insane, but somehow this works.

NEGATIVES: the luck factor is a bit too high, even though the game is quite short. I also feel it ends a bit too soon.

A wonderful dice game that doesn't feel all that random and even plays quickly. The different levels of progress - developments, food, coins, monuments - offer so many choices each round that sometimes you don't even realize changing your strategy every turn.

Great filler dice game; one of the best I have played. It's basically Yahtzee with a purpose (dice allocation game). Use the luck of the die to build/maintain the best civilization you can. Not a whole lot of depth, but nicely produced, fun, and one of the better fillers I have played. Would happily play again and looking forward to trying out The Late Bronze Age.

RATING: 7
12/03/09 Obtained, second edition. Unlike some dice allocation games (e.g. Settlers of Catan dice game) that are nothing more than glorified Yahtzee, Roll Though the Ages has more than one path to victory, and there is player interaction. Different strategies can be developed and pursued. Most dice games play themselves because there's really only one way to win. The solitaire option for RttA is challenging, unlike most games that have one that normally feels just tacked on. Production standards are high (in my 2nd edition). I appreciate the thick pad of score sheets. 
As of 12/06/17 I've played 18 games, most were three or four player affairs. Two were two-player.

RATING: 6
This is quite a nice little game with quality wooden pieces. Build cities to increase production (get more dice) then use your turn to make improvements, build yet more cities and wonders, whilst trying to keep your people fed and safe from disaster.

It's quick to play and it's easy to overlook other players' scores as the end approaches. Not one I plan to buy as I think I'll get enough from the occasional club play, and I know a few people who own it.

Game in a Nutshell: Use dice to make for the fastest civ building diversion out there.

Played as: Solo, 2 player (2,3,4 player on Yucata.de)

Pros: LOVE the big chunky wood dice and player boards. Has a classic-ness to it while offering a different twist on the short dice game. Would make for a fine filler due to short play.

Cons: The game never fully gets over looking like a total cluster. Mechanically, it feels very spreadsheet-sh. Lacks player interaction. The first few rolls are too important... an awesome first couple turns can be tough to overcome for the opponents. There's less choice (the advancements aren't all that great) and more just doing the best with what's given to you. I wasn't impressed by the solo game.

Other: After enough plays, you begin to realize that it's more a fast shallow game than the quick civ simulation you were really hoping for. Haven't tried the advanced rules but my impression is it would only strip out what's still good in the game (the shortness) and just make it a longer random grind (there's other games I'd rather play in an hour time-slot). 

Best Use: Perfect for a quick, durable game on the road.

This may be the first civ-builder filler and it's quite fun.  A dice rolling game where you're rolling for food, money, goods & workers.  You can re-roll dice a couple of times but may need to face consequences if SKULLZ are rolled.  The cool thing is that that skulls provide some "goods" (which are traded for money to build on the technology track (powers) and some of those earned powers allow you to use the skulls against your opponents.

You need to feed your people, build temples, build cities (for more dice), etc.  As with most of these types of games in the end it's a pretty good idea to try to stick to a strategy just be aware that the dice may change that strategy and a little modification may be necessary.

Also, for a small game I thought the production was quite good. The pegboards were a great concept for keeping track of food and goods.

What a light dice game should be.  The combination of the goods peg board and the little player civ sheet makes for a pretty fun little civ experience.  I've had to up my rating to a 10 since I have over 400 solitaire plays.

RATING: 8
A fun dice rolling game with great components. There is plenty of paper included to play many, many times. 

The only problem I've seen with the components is that the dice pictures appear to be a little faded and they appear that they can fade over time. I've only played around 5 plays so far, so it's tough to tell how worn they will get.

Overall, a fun game, but I give the game an 8 because the theme is a little light for me.

RATING: 7
I always had the sneaking suspicion that this game was actually playing me rather than the other way around.  Every decision, every move seemed to be pre-programmed by the gameplay, so much so that I felt that I was only around to throw around the dice.  Bye-bye!

Okay ultra-lite civ game. Nothing too spectacular. Our one play degenerated into a "who-can-roll-the-most-skulls-and-screw-everyone-else" dice fest.

RATING: 5
A dice-based game wherein players roll dice to get resources, and then use those resources to either build cities (to get more dice when rolling), build buildings (to get special powers), or build monuments (to get points).

While that description makes it sound fun, and much like other euro-games I like, this game is _way_ too random.  While you do get to re-roll some dice a few times, it just ends up being a fest of "who can get lucky first".  

I'm sure there's strategy, and I'm sure there's ways to mitigate the luck, but I don't want to bother to spend the time learning them.  Because even after I do, it'll still all come down to a dice roll.

And if I'm going to roll this many dice in a game, I'd rather be playing something like Battleground: Fantasy Warfare or Conflict of Heroes.  If I want a euro-game, I want to be able to control it some!

Bah.

Roll dice to improve your civilization for most points.

Plays: 2.
Type: Dice game = a game where you roll lots of dice.
Complexity: Medium dice game.
# of players: See BGG.
Playing time: See BGG.
Player interaction: Competition for unlimited resources - monuments and some dice results that can hurt other players.
Randomness: High - Dice.

Replayability: Average, it's very quick so why not play again?
Fun: A bit, when dice go your way.
Memorability: Not really, it's a dry experience and quickly over.

Thematic integration: Weak.
Components: Nice dice. The need for pen-and-paper scoring is a bit fiddly.

Who will like this: Meh. I don't imagine anyone feeling strongly about this either way.

I like this quick dice-playing game.

Pretty components.

Not too much interaction though, which results in down time when playing with 3-4 players.  (Edit: Reduced rating from a 9 because this aspect keeps it from holding our interest.)

I prefer the longer version (expansion rules).  Otherwise, developments are slurped up too fast to make effort spent building monuments worthwhile.  Maybe the same exists with the longer version too...will have to play it more to find out.

Just not much here.  Really, really noninteractive.  There is very little that the other players do that affects you in any way - at least, nothing much you can do anything about.  And just when the game starts to feel interesting, it's over.  Disappointing - had unrealistically high hopes for this (granted, it was just the name that did it, and I do understand that the games don't really have much in common with each other) and it failed badly.  Also, the components, which show such promise (all wood!) are terrible.  The dice are faded, the pegs don't fit well in the peg boards, the colors are too similar.  Just all around a let-down.

This was a pleasant surprise, though I absolutely would not want to play with more than two people--the downtime would be terrible. There's some nice stuff to consider, and the game actually seems to have some strategy to it. All in all, pleased with this one as a leisurely pastime.

[b]Update:[/b] After about a dozen plays, Roll Through the Ages started to just seem like the same game over and over. But we kept plugging away, and I have to say it's really grown on me. Experienced players should trounce new ones, so this is not as much of a luck fest as it might seem, and--with two players at least--there's been an increasing amount of interactivity. Some moves seem stronger than others, but once both players realize that, you have to start coming up with new strategies to pull of the win. I'm not a big fan of resource management games, but Roll Through the Ages keeps things light and quick while providing a decent amount of depth. I'm surprised to be saying it, but I think this one's a keeper!

Fun dice game - a bit like Yahtzee with more theme. In particular I like the Workers mechanic; trying to spread them between monuments and cities.

The wooden bits are of a fantastic, hefty quality.

Sometimes I feel a bit restrained by having to feed cities (although this can be allayed by keeping high food rolls in previous turns), but I recognise this is a fundamental part of the game.
The game can feel a little short in a similar way to Agricola; ending just as you get into the swing of things. There is a variant to add a few more turns, which may rectify this, although I haven't tried it.

RATING: 7.5
A dice roller to simulate a mini-civ building game. This one is very clever and comes complete with great components.

The game revolves around 5 key features...goods, population, coins, food and wonders/cities. Population is needed to build new cities and wonders of the world (worth VPs). Cities are vital as they allow more dice to be acquired and rolled each turn but cities require food so immediately there is a conflict on what should be kept each turn. Goods and coins are needed to develop new advances, which in turn offer a player a key benefit as well as some victory points. 

But all of this rolling comes with some risk as Skulls represent hazards and disasters. Some of these can be negated by developing the right advancement.

The backdrop to all this is that the game will come to an end when a certain number of Wonders are built, sot he clock is always ticking...and rarely does a player complete all that they set out too.

This is the only real complaint for some people. That the game ends just as it gets going. As a filler I think it is fine but the Late Bronze Age mod apparently fixes this issue to some degree.

I'm rating this an '8' for my first game but it may drop to a '7' after more plays.  The wooden components are of very nice quality and add to the game's Bronze Age theme.  The scoring sheets are well designed with everything you need at your fingertips. This is a fun family or solo game that captures the theme really well and has interesting decisions for such a simple game.  The potential downside I see is the game can end too soon, not allowing time to use developments or monuments. Udate: Dropped to a 7 due to my initial concern.

In this Civilization themed dice rolling game, each player gets a scorepad showing their cities, developments, monuments,  and disasters. Roll dice to get resources to grow your economy, such as earning more dice, get more storage, get more bonuses for building and so forth. 

The components are nice, and the game clocks in under 45 minutes. It has a fair share of luck, and there are various strategies to try each time you play. Games are typically quite short, and over in about six or seven turns (one of the game ending mechanisms is the player to build 5 developments).

It's fun, pretty quick and doesn't require a lot of exhaustive thinking. This game has slowly grown on me over time and despite the luck, there are various things one can try.

This seems to be an OK filler game that I would play on occasion. It is not a good enough to be a "lunch time" game like 7 Wonders or Dominion. The biggest problem is the downtime since there isn't much interest in watching other players roll and try to figure out what they are going to do and since you can't make any decision until you roll you dice, you don't have anything to think about for your next turn while waiting.

It's got the "build a path to victory from the morass of choices" thing that reaches apotheosis in Feld or Hansa Teutonica, but it seemed like the winning choice is to invest in workers to get more dice.

Press your luck dice game similar to Yahtzee. If you get lucky rolls, you're going to do well. I scored a ton of people one round and took a couple of monuments. If you score a ton of food, in one round, you don't have to worry about it later. It's still mainly a luck game.

With four players, the game seems to end a bit too quickly in someone building five developments. Pestilence is also very powerful, but I wouldn't consider that as a flaw, since it's one of the most hilarious things in the entire game.

Edit: The official Late Bronze Age score sheet has a lot more interesting set of developments.

Entertaining dice roller with a nice bit of theme and progressive play slapped on. And it comes with a huge wad of score sheets. I've only played this with two and think it might have more going for it with more players.

Update: I've played it with four and it is better than with two.

RATING: 8
Despite the title and artwork, Roll Through the Ages has got absolutely nothing to do with the heaviest Eurogame in town (Through the Ages): it's got a historical topic with players building monuments and achieving developments, but it's basically a push-your-luck resource management game with some room for dirty play (which is always welcome).

Players have got to score points throwing dice one to three times each turn and milking the throws the most: via goods used to gain developments, builders to get extra dice (cities) or construct monuments, food to "feed the dice" every turn and skulls to keep players on their toes (if the skulls are three it will be their opponents who are on their toes). There's a considerable amount of information involved in the whole palette of developments for the actual difficulty of the game but overall it plays quickly, easily and in a rather endearing way.

RATING: 6.5
Looked a little bit thin at first, and we were wondering what it actually had to offer that Pocket Civ didn't. But, as it turns out, it's an engaging if hardly intellectual exercise, and a system that seems to be set up nicely for future expansions. The luck quotient is far less than in some games that don't even require dice. Playing with the optional trading gives it a Catan-esque bite, too.

Further Thoughts: the web-published expansion is the key to keeping this one alive. Print, laminate and enjoy.

RATING: 9
I really like the wooden dice.  For one thing they're attractive; for another, they force the player to weigh the value of each roll against the possibility of a superior result from rolling again.  This is a little stressful for cautious types like myself, but also exciting.  There are actually lots of decisions to be made on each turn, and things move fairly quickly in this game, even with four players.  

The wooden pegboard for keeping track of goods and food is very nice, although the pegs themselves are a little too thin and therefore easily dislodged.  The score sheets are nicely formatted and scoring is refreshingly straightforward. 

The fact that this game can even be played solo puts it high on my list of games to purchase.(5+4)

RATING: 6
A simple but clever roll dice and score game that nevertheless offers real choices. The bits are very nice, too, particularly the dice. Plus the company provides ample scoresheets. Seems like a good one to suck non-gamers into. One several other popular games, such as "Ticket to Ride," "Carcassonne," "Dominion," that didn't catch on with either me or my family. Also, I had a hard time understanding the rules about keeping 6 goods, and 'disasters.' Traded in June of 2011.  Purchased new, September 2010.

Really nice strategic, dice rolling, resource collecting game! I like this game and the components are really awesome! My one complaint is that once you feel you have your strategy in mind...the game ends...so quickly! Needs more plays with other players to know for sure! 

I do enjoy the solitaire game variant; I think this is where the game most shines! Only 10 turns to complete your strategy...tricky!

Very good, but I feel a dilemma: solo play is fast, but you can't trade (or socialize); 3 players is great, but too long for what it is (last time we spent 75 minutes). So the best is to play in 2? I'm not sure: this would be long enough and not as good as in 3. Am I clear in this? Well, solution is to play every once in a while...

Roll symbolled dice to get food (to keep your VP’s), workers (buy more dice or go for VP monuments) and resources (to buy tech tree powers also worth VP’s). You get to actively choose what to pursue with your two re-rolls based on what you’ve bought so far and what your opponents are doing, all recorded via personal score pads. There’s some nice tech tree combinations to shoot for, some engine-building vs VP trade-offs, and races to complete things first - all of which makes for an engaging game. It has the added advantage of tailoring length (using the Late Bronze Age rules) and interaction (using the optional trading element). Repeated play seems to show that the tech tree is unbalanced (protection against pestilence seems powerful) which has diminished the allure somewhat.

"Solid civ-themed meaty filler dice game. A bit drier than ideal for a gateway. Very enjoyable."

What I like:
- There are a surprising number of tough decisions (both strategic and tactical)
- Rolling dice is always fun
- Solid wood components in a small box

What I don't like:
- Managing goods is confusing at first
- Game can end too soon
- Using pencil and paper to track progress

Overall, a solid dice game that is light enough for casual gamers but interesting enough for medium gamers too. It requires more thinking than Ra Dice. I think the weight of 1.8 is about right.

A quick game of dice, with a bit more to it then most dice games. The game ends fast, so keep that in mind when making decisions on adding more dice, getting powers (worth a few points) or getting monuments (worth more points). The more dice you have, the more stuff you can get, but also the more food you need each turn. Ends a little too quickly, just when it is getting interesting.

Good solo game or 2 player game.  If you add a third or fourth player, you begin to have more downtime than a game of this weight should have.  When you are rolling your dice, there is very little that happens that will impact me, so I have little interest in what you roll.  In a 2 player game, it is not really an issue.  I would definitely not recommend this as a 4 player game.  Despite all this, it is fun exploring which developments work together and trying to use dice results as best you can.  It is true that if you do not roll workers early, you are going to have a tough go at it.

Be warned: this light Yahtzee-ish dice game has nothing in common with the game "Through the Ages" except the box art.  In this game, you got to roll dice to collect money (or resources that could be converted to money) to buy advancements that gave you special abilities and were worth victory points, or you could collect people, which either let you roll more dice or build monuments worth points.  You were allowed to re-roll your dice, unless it came up as a disaster which must be kept.  The severity of the disaster depends on how many disaster icons you rolled.  This game was pretty random, and I wish it didn't end so suddenly.

Turned off by the bits. Oversized, unfinished wooden dice, custom scoresheets with tiny boxes for marking your x's, and pegs that won't stay in their holes.

A fun game on many levels. The dice, boards, and score sheets are satisfying to manipulate. There are several ways to win, and you need to adapt your strategy somewhat to what you roll.

Interesting civilization building/ dice game. You're using dice to collect food, goods and workers, which you use to build developments, cities and monuments. Components are absolutely beautiful...

It's a lite Civ-builder. The designer claimed he modeled it after Advanced Civilization, and for what it is, he did a pretty damn fine job for something that can be compressed into a 40 minute timeframe.

I mean, it's no Through the Ages, but it's more than Civ Yahtzee. 
I think it's a fine, light game. Good as a gateway, and with the online rules "expansion", adds enough meat to be genuinely enjoyable at a bit of length.

A game that had a lot of potential, but falls into mediocrity. Build cities, feed cities, roll for goods and workers that will give you VPs... Coins do not seem to play a strategic element in the game and can be ignored entirely. Every die has only 1 icon of every possible result - which makes for totally random results on each roll and no real strategy. Finally, disasters over three skulls are also pretty much useless strategically. Maybe improved with the new players sheets they developed, but it will take some work convincing my gaming group to play again.

A city-building type of game using a dice rolling & re-rolling system similar to that seen in Yahtzee and other games. Points are scored based on your choices of converting the dice results into food, goods, money, workers, etc. and building various monuments & cities.

The game plays really quickly and there appear to be plenty of options for trying out different strategies.

Components (1st Edition) are definitely not up to the quality I was expecting. Some of the symbols on some of the dice are barely visible. The holes in the peg boards appear to be hand-drilled, with mistakes and partially-drilled holes in some places - and there are scuffs which have taken off the (important!) numbers under some of the symbols.

RATING: 6
Quick yahtzee type game. It doesn't really feel like you're building a civilization at all, and at the same time it does require the bookkeeping and calculations and resources and food and workers that you find in civilization building games.

There's a little bit of interaction, a little bit of strategy, but it's mostly rolling dice. It's not bad; rolling dice is fun, and trying to roll the skulls to get a plague on the other players instead of yourself, or trying to snipe a wonder from someone else gets he attention of the rest of the players in an otherwise solitaire game. You can make some nice combos with your developments, but the game will be over before someone can really take advantage.

One problem I see with Roll Through the Ages is that it's balanced to the point where you don't very much care what you roll.

Not a bad filler, but I prefer King of Tokyo in this type of game. Better integrated theme, far more interaction, simpler (less bookkeeping), more variation between games, and it's more honest about being a luck-based dice fest. It also feel like there's more on the line when you roll your dice.

Played numerous solo games, and finally played one face to face, almost forgetting that skulls rolled cannont be rerolled; just goes to show that even with a simple ruleset things can be overlooked if not played often enough (or it's a sign of dementia).

Marginally better than the Settlers dice game (though not as exciting as I employ a running score rule in Settlers) in that RttA has a better narrative and interesting ways to improve on die rolls (note To Court a King that improving is better than modifying, as it doesn't rob you of the tension of pushing your luck).

One thing the Settlers dice game has over RttA is the visual nature of the game compared to the wordiness of RttA. It is interesting to see how for some players (especially mentally drained) how difficult to see the profitable avenues and so deciding what to keep and reroll.

As with most dice games suffers from spectator issues, with the exception of 3 skulls rolled changing passivity to active non-player interest.

Update: played another face to face game and again found the play interesting, but not exciting or fun. I think the problem is that despite the strong theme of building it is a 'left brain' experience. It is difficult to 'see' the best avenue of progress because the process of bookkeeping seems to be at the fore rather than comparing the status which is essential to know in order to then determine where to get ahead: you then have goals to go for and so can get excited about the die rolls. This is where the Settlers dice game succeeds.

The fun part about this game is that you can quickly learn it, and quickly play it. It's a game you can take anywhere, lay it out and play and it doesn't take too much deep strategy concentration. Probably more fun w/ 3 or 4 people, but even for a 2 person game it's a nice quick one. My wife liked it.

Nice Yahtzee variant with some real choices (but no more difficult). Much, much better than the Catan Dice game (which is extremely restrictive - Yahtzee has more choices). 

I believe the game is better if one modifies the rules a bit - the game as it stands is over far too quickly. We often play that the game ends when one player has 7 techs (vrs 5) or when all of the monuments have been built AND one player has at least 3 of these (not necessarily the first place monument but has at least 3). This seems to add just enough time to make the game a bit meatier without overstaying its welcome.

It sure looks pretty but for that price, all you get is a very sophisticated Yahtzee clone (albeit better than King of Tokyo). The interaction is limited and there is not much you can do to hinder, let alone attack opponents. Sure, some of you dice rolls might result in minus points for your opponents, but the problem is that you would never make a strategic decision to do so but rather accept that fact if you should happen to roll the dice that cause minus points for you enemies and as such, it is as random as the rest of the game. At least, there are two levels of strategy, push-your-luck when rolling the dice and some decision make as to where to allocate the workers/money. An okay Yahtzee clone that is not interactive enough to make it shine.

I enjoy this as a two player game--haven't tried it with more yet [Edit: tried it with 4 and it was different, still fun--Medicine is more important!]. I still like Roma better because it feels more interactive/like a knife fight in a phone booth. This game seems to be over too quickly, but after more plays I see that it is about the right length for trying different tactics. Making it longer would not improve the overall experience--it's not a civ building game...Indeed, with more plays I am enjoying it for what it is. I really like the fact that it is over with quickly but it makes you want to play again to try out a new tactic. It's one of the few games that my wife wants to play.

After initially being underwhelmed by this game, it's grown on me to become a firm favourite - I've lost count of how many times I've played it.  It is utterly remarkable in the fact that my initial rating was a 6, and I had been tempted to give it a 4!

I can't wait to have a dice themed night. I seem to be amassing quite a few dice-centric games lately. This is, as I think was intended, a light civilization game which will still offer enough decisions to keep it a little out of the "filler" category. 

UPDATE: After a few more plays of this game, I'm going to make a solid '8'. I was able to find that several paths to victory exist and the replayability is excellent.

It's working for me. I don't mind the comparison to Yahtzee - I love Triple Yahtzee! There's some clear cut strategies to try and luck won't result in a win (but it does help). Downtime bit annoying, and it is a very simple game, but I got into it immediately.

In the end, had to sell it. Bit too simple for our gaming group but the kids found it dull.

This is without doubt the best dice game I've ever played. Most dice games feel like a variation of Yahtzee and while this has some Yahtzee like mechanics there is so much more involved that you'll hardly notice. Lots of hidden depth in this one and very fun.

The definitive gateway game to convert lovers of Yahtzee to the hobby. Games take 10 to 15 minutes. This is a largely simultaneous solo game.  There is only one rule in the base game that allows one player to affect others. The free expansion, low price, and amazing components make this a no-brainer.

Roll Through the Ages encapsulates all of the things I love about civ games and shrinks them down into, well, a capsule.  I love that this game takes twenty minutes to play!  For the most part you can really plan out almost exactly what you'd like to do, but the chance of rolling skulls (and sometimes you want skulls) creates enough randomness to make the game interesting.  This game utilizes one of my favorite game attributes which is to force players to work with what they have to the best of their abilities. Besides, the pieces are neat. I didn't have any real component complaints with my game.  The dice are too big for my tiny hands though.

If you like Through the Ages . . . but you don't have time for the epic gaming experience . . . and you really like rolling dice . . . go play Yahtzee.  Seriously, if it wasn't for the completely unrelated title, no one would want to even try this game.  It's a lot like Yahtzee, but with an unnecessarily complicated rule set and theme.  That said, it is fun for what it is, but then, so is Yahtzee.

RATING: 7.5
Solid dice rolling game.  I like the theme.  I found this game pretty kid friendly.  Sure, the younger ones need help with the developments (selection of and ability to pay them).  I have found though that if they are capable of basic math, they can handle the feeding mechanic, placing the workers in the monuments, and moving the goods around. 

They all enjoy rolling the dice and trying to stick me with pestilence (thats why I often research medicine pretty quickly) :D

Update: moved up to a 7.5.  I like this game quite a bit.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A slickly themed and produced, but not very interesting, dice game. It definitely works and looks good, but doesn't really scratch any itch for me. Maybe because it is rare than any roll is a total disaster, it lacks the drama of some other dice games. There are some decisions about long vs short-term strategies, and risk-taking on the big monuments, but the rest is largely turn by turn points optimization. Possibly as good as a dice game of this sort can be (better than Settler's Dice Game for instance) but that is not a high bar in my book.

CIVILIZATION BUILDING WITH DICE - DEFINITELY NICE
First play impression: a light game that I would call more than a "filler".  My 11 YO son was instantly intriqued and beat me handilly the first game.  Fun, portable, and I would think accessible to a wide range of people.  Definitely a perfect take along on a trip sort of game.  Probably a good pub game as well.  If you are looking for a genuine civ building experience, keep looking, this isn't it.  Good gaming value for the $$$ as well.

This is a great quick dice game that I would call a strategic yahtzee.  Plays solo in about 20 minutes.  is a dice game but the dice rolls aren't so overpowered with luck because there is always some thing that can be done with the dice.  I believe there is a real number crunching game of probabilities with this game but it doesn't have to be that way to be enjoyed.  I think it's a game that can be fun for analyzers and casual players.  Played three times solo and improved all three game thus proving to me that there is a good learning curve and the dice rolls don't always have to dominant the outcome but rather how one uses the dice is more important.  Pleasantly surprised by this game

It´s a very simple dice game, agile, fresh, addictive, quick, but with more strategy than you can think at first sight. I love their pyrographically engraved dices, and the thick wooden boards of resources: they give a primitive touch that fits very well with the theme. I think it's a great production design success, but it makes final product expensive, of course. Perhaps the paper pads should have been better, graphically speaking, or made of papyrus paper, for instance: that way could be more in line with the whole set (I don´t know if you know what I mean...). These pads are quite dull, and I'm thinking of making something handmade at home to replace them. Anyway, my wife and me really liked this one, and we recommend it. It´s a good dice game.

--Jan2009-- Cool stuff.  Not at all sure about the branding, but the game is a nice light die-rolling affair.  --Jan2017-- Sold.  I enjoyed this while it was here; but have had rather little interest in any recent play.  Don't expect to reacquire it.

Visual Appeal: (3)
This is an attractive and easy to decipher filler even if it looks like a history nerd's Yahtzee. Not much to look at really.

Components: (5)
The box is a great size for a filler game. It easily fits into a small bag for transportation. The pieces are all durable wood. The dice could be a little heavier, but they roll well enough. Paper score sheets are provided and they are plentiful. you can even print more online for free in addition to a "Late Bronze Age" variant. Love the game support! 

Theme: (3)
The game is a press your luck mechanism thinly veiled in the lightest civ game you will ever see. There's really a decent amount of flavor in the technologies and buildings that you produce, but I like themes to pop a little more. This game has it, but it still feels like roll, score, repeat to me.

Learning: (4)
It is a pretty simple game to learn. Players usually get a handle of the odds on the dice pretty quickly. The technologies are pretty self explanatory. Just remember to feed your cities!

Gameplay: (3)
The game goes by rather quickly. Balancing when to take people over money takes some practice, but it's a very calculate-able game. The game doesn't really promise much interaction, so I can't really hold it accountable. It provides just a little. I think there is one technology that allows you to affect your opponent with skulls on your die. Also completing buildings first will make them worth fewer VP to other players.

Overall Fun: (3)
There is some challenge to the game, but it quickly grows repetitive as you can only maximize your points in 1 or 2 ways depending on how the die come out. I think that in my usual groups, a press your luck game like "Zombie Dice" would do better for it's humor and taunt-friendliness.

RATING: 7
Very clever dice rolling civilization game. The dice give you food, workers to build cities and monuments, or goods to pay for developments. Each player tracks what they get on a board with pegs and what they build/develop on a sheet. Plays a little too fast with the end conditions what they are.

RATING: 5
Played once.  Players only really interact through monuments and disasters which I feel would limit the replayability.  It has interestingly varying mechanics for money (can store via goods, but limited), food (can store, less limited), and workers (must use immediately).  Due to the lack of interaction, though, I feel like you could develop an optimal strategy that would work nearly every time.

Not exactly the type of game I like (too much randomness), but nevertheless fun and quick to play. Great gateway game, although I guess I'd rather pull out King of Tokyo than this one.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
There's a few different strategies you can employ when playing this, which keeps it interesting. One way to play this though is fast - these roll again dice mechanisms really seem to fall flat with more than three players. In its basic form it's not far off being a solitaire dice game. The luck of calamities has a significant impact that is exacerbated by the shortness of the game - before you know it the game is over and you've blown your chances by trying to counter the calamities with your developments. Much like life, but that doesn't necessarily translate into a very positive gaming experience.

The small box and game footprint would seem well suited to taking this game to play on a plane, or just travelling in general.

The Late Bronze Age expansion adds real value to this game for me. Turns it into a game I quite like and my rating for the base game reflects this.

Forget about making numbers combinations like in [i]Yathzee[/i] or [i]Poker[/i], as every dice side stands for a kind of resource and it is up to you to build a strategy out of what you have rolled, with the help of the achieved developments.

It is slightly frustrating to see this nice list of developments and monuments, and to be able to tick only a handful before the game is over...

My wife really likes the Yahtzee type, push your luck games, I'm not a big fan.  So, as it turns out, this is a game she likes, while at the same time being interesting enough for me to want to play.  Love the Civ theme and resource management aspect but the game is a little light for my tastes.  This almost hits a sweet spot for the both of us.

This is civilization as a light dice game. Each player gets a scoresheet where they record their choices. It does not bear comparison with Yahtzee. You roll dice each turn, one die per number of cities in your empire. You can reroll dice up to three times, with the exception that you can't reroll a skull. One skull is not harmful, but two or more have different disaster effects, usually negative score points. You roll wheat to feed your empire, which needs one wheat per city or you suffer starvation (another disaster effect). Roll a gold which lets you buy advancements this turn (unused gold is lost). There are five goods you can accumulate of different rarity, and a cribbage-like board for marking your stored goods and wheat.  Goods can be sold as sets to buy the more expensive advancements. Advancements change the rules of the game, offering you bonus score points, cheaper construction, or improve the effectiveness of various die roll results. Roll workers (again, use it or lose it) to invest in monuments and new cities. The larger your empire gets, the more likely you will suffer disaster effects, but there are advancements to mitigate most of then.

I enjoyed the game because your dice can be used in so many ways with different trade offs, but your turns are still very quick. The game ends after someone buys a fifth advancement. Your score at the end is the sum of your advancement points, monument points and bonuses for monuments and cities, minus your disaster points. There are several paths you can take to victory. If the dice aren't cooperating, you can try a different path. A nice quick civ on dice.

Game felt weird to me, because all faces of the die are beneficial, and I fell into the trap of just buying stuff from turn to turn, absent longer-term planning.. [-]Have to try this some more.[/-] A dice game, and nothing more. A bunch of $$$ for poor component quality (Asmodee would have knocked this one out of the park). Badly printed wooden dice, no pencils provided, and the contents don't fit in the box, if you use the bag they give you.

Check out my lukewarm review [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/389813]here[/url].

Mediocre. Uninteresting player interaction where you don't care what others are doing, just that they'd hurry their turn up. The Developments are weird (read the review), and the winner can often be determined by who rolls Pestilence the most often.

Fun, quick little dice roller.  I like all of the different things going on.  We aren't talking about the greatest depth in the world, but if you need a quick fix of civ building, but don't have 3-4 hours to play Through the Ages, then you CANNOT go wrong with this.  A lot more fun than more intricate games that are "supposedly" better.

First problem here are the components.  Normally, I don't gripe about component quality (I LOVE Winsome games) but this was too much.  After seeing the amazing custom dice in Express Line, sepia markings on plain wood just don't cut it.  Besides that, the heft isn't right.  

Beyond that, the game isn't all that compelling.  Granted there is some interesting stuff going here.  That I like.  Unfortunately, because there is so much going on, there can be some significant down time between turns when no one is rolling the dice.  For me, time not rolling dice is a big negative for a die-rolling game.  So this meant the game went on too long.  The problem is, that the actual game playing portion seemed way to short.  So the game takes too long to do too little.  Not a good combination. [01-01-2010]

Own this because one of the staff at Compleat strategist in NY convinced my friend "it's the same as TTA". I'm still pissed off...

The game has for me the least attractive components of any game I own. I'll take plastic over wood any day. Plus it's dry as a desert and it's a MPS. 

[u]EDIT: Played with The Late Bronze Age expansion and it's much better.[/u] 
First of all: the monuments and goods have NAMES! (Which genius forgot to include them in the first place!?) 
Second: More stuff to do, making the game come to its full fruition as you can pursue a specific path a couple of turns
Third: Obligatory trading phase may not be much, but you actually look at other player's boards. What a relief that is. 
So all in all expansion feels like the only way to play this game (I call it "designer's cut"). 

With that it's a 6. Dropped 0.5 point for base game. Go expansion! 

Edit: traded away

2013: 8. Great design, and great components.  I love how this wraps up the feeling of building a civilization into a fast-playing dice rolling game.  I've played it a lot, and I think there may be some strategies and development combinations that are more powerful than others, but I'm not sure.  Feels like you could rush developments and end the game before someone else finished building their monuments.

Little to no player interaction, but I'm ok with that.

The downloadable expansion/extended rules really boost the game up and make it even more interesting for those who want just a few more options in a longer game.

Again, brilliant design of making "Civ" into "Yahtzee", it's worth a space on your shelf for that alone.

[4 plays] This turned out to be the game I hoped it was. Fairly light, very quick, and with just enough theme to make it fun without unnecessary chrome. Better than Airships, To Court The King, and other light dice games out there. I love tracking score with pencil on a pad, especially with all of the information on the score pads giving you all of the rules you need to play the game.

Reminds me vaguely of the old Plagues and Pestilence card game in atmosphere. I can't wait to try it with the Late Bronze Age score sheet changes.

Light and fluffy 'yahtzee' type game. Players roll dice in order to generate workers, money, food, goods in order to build cities (more dice), monuments (VPs), developments (VPs & special abilities). Failing to get food will result in -ve points.

Essentially multiplayer solitaire but still great as a filler. Would have been great to have doubled or tripled the amount of dice to other players can take their turns while opponents are allocating results.

Overly generous players' pad adds weight to the box.

Smart dice roller that never takes as long to play as it says it does on the box. Though this is attached to the 'Through The Ages' franchise, it feel much more like a 7 Wonders dice game IMO - Which is no bad thing!

RATING: 6
Roll Through the Ages (which is nothing like Through the Ages nor Pandemic) is an enjoyable dice-based filler of the roll-and-collect variety where you build out your, uh, civilization. You can pay for nice upgrades for cash, build monuments primarily for points (your interaction with others), and you must pay for your dice (uh, 'cities') to eat so need to roll food, too. It's an enjoyable half-hour-or-so experience and FRED's done a nice job with the little wooden peg boards, although the wooden dice are just okay.

Cute game, though we think there probably is a formula to how to play and come first (start with cities, then go to monuments, getting developments when you have spare cash).  If this is the case, then it becomes quite luck based, depending on what you roll.

Sometimes, this can be the style of game I enjoy though, and I'd like to try it again to test the theory.

I have to admit I'm really impressed with how much game there is in this package. A few dice, a wooden board, some pegs and a sheet of paper are enough to create a feeling of developing your civilisation. It's not the deepest game out there, what you need to do each turn is pretty straightforward and due to the playing time, there isn't much gravity to your choices. On the other hand, how many board games give you the opportunity to develop a civilisation during a lunch break?

The solo aspect of the game works as a clever puzzle, giving you 10 turns to rack up as many points as possible. Thoroughly enjoyable, compact, easy to explain and with a small space requirement, this game is ideal for travelling on a train. Well worth the price.

Nagyon jól belőtt kockajáték olyan tekintetben, hogy egy Alea Iacta Estnél könnyedebb, de egy Zombie Dice-nál több figyelmet követel. A játékelemek szépek, az A4-es jegyzetpapíron minden információ rajta van, ami szükséges. A játékosok a nagy táblás játékhoz hasonlóan városokat, monomentumokat építenek, különböző találmányokat fejlesztenek ki és közben katasztrófák érik őket. Két interakció van összesen a játékban, de az egyiket gyorsan ki is lehet küszöbölni, adott fejlesztés felépítésével. A másik pedig a monomentumok felépítésénél jelentkezik. Szóval inkább egyedüli játék a RTTA. 4-en se vészesen hosszú a játékidő, de jobb kevesebben játszani azért. Valószínűleg van benne erős stratégia, ezért nem kap több pontot, de érdemes kipróbálni.

[2013-04-20]
Minél többet játszom vele annál kevésbé tetszik. A szerencsefaktora ugyanakkora, mint a Zombi Dice játéké kb., de mégis hosszabb és sokkal unalmasabb, kevésbé szórakoztató. Egy idő után már megvan mindenkinek mire, hogyan érdemes menni és ezen a kieg se változtat. A pontját nem csökkentem azért, mert végülis bármikor elővehető, de az biztos, hogy egymás után sok játékot nem igazán tudok elképzelni vele.

This game is much more fun if you don't care what happens.  It's a light filler, and as long as you don't expect anything with depth, and treat it solely as a fun little dice game.

This is less a standard dice game and something more along the lines of games were your actions are determined by dice (Minos, War of the Ring).  In those two games in particular, you have a board and a number of options that are allowed to you once you have rolled certain kinds of actions.  Here everything is abstracted out to where the dice dictate your whole game.  

You roll wheat you can feed your people, if you don't you starve.  If you don't get goods, then you can't get discoveries, no people equals no cities or monuments.  Now in a likely scenario all things even out over time.  Unfortunately, this game is too short to do that.  So you roll to see what happens and you make some minor decisions with how you allot your fate.

I do mind the rolling penalties for everyone but the player that rolled them.  Those diseases (or whatever they are called) can stack up quick and effectively eliminate you without any chance of protecting yourself.  If you were never able to get medicine, then you can easily lose 10 or more points.  This wipes out any sense of multiple paths to victory.  But, at least it gives a choice to the player that is stuck with two of the death's heads.  Do they reroll something that they really need to screw other players (and get more goods).

While it is cool that they did what they did in a dice game, I feel like many of the decisions you make are all just attempts to see what happens.  This is fine in an experience game, but there isn't a whole lot of experience here.

All in all it functions, and is quick and harmless.  A fun enough closer.  But, a bit of a disappointment considering the name that it is attached to.  But what was I to expect?

It's a fun dice roller that doesn't outstay it's welcome. You can, of course, be hosed by the dice, but there are certainly precautions you can take to protect yourself. It's also nice that you can reroll any of your dice during your turn, even the ones you "kept". Not sure if I'd like it with four as there probably isn't anything to do on the others' turn. Also, not sure if I'd like the extended game as when it's over with it felt just right.

Growing up, I used to love Yahtzee, a game I still enjoy on occasion.  Something about rolling and hoping you get what you need.  RttA is a great graduation of that system and I enjoy it very much!  There's also nothing like rolling some skulls and attacking your friends.  Turns out this is a very enjoyable solo timekill as well - top score of 79 solo!

RATING: 5.5
This just sort of feels like Yahtzee with a civ-building theme tacked on. I don't mind a lot of randomness in games, but I feel like a game needs to have some level of excitement to go along with that randomness. This game is random as hell, but I didn't think there was any real fun to be found here. Just dry and boring, without enough strategy to justify being so dry.

Sweet little dice game, with a great Civ theme and a bunch of interesting choices to elevate way above Yahtzee without having too many rules.  It's really good for what it is: just a nice, light filler.  The rules are a bit too terse and hopefully the second printing will improve on the dice quality.

UPDATE: Dropping the rating down to just a 7, since I think it's a bit hard to track what your opponents are doing.  Really actually just enjoy the solo game with this one.

Actually, it is good. In fact, it may be the best of the complicated-Yahtzee-variant genre -- it works well, AND it has a way-cool theme! And I quite like the production, wooden dice and all! I ended up playing this 5 more times later on (a nickel already!).

The game is simple: start with 3 cities. Each city = 1 d6 (specially marked). You get 3 rerolls; can reroll anything except the disaster tiles. Collect food and resources rolled. Then feed cities (1 food each) -- each deficiency = -1 point. Finally, use workers to build cities (dice) or monuments (VP), and coins/resources to buy developments (special powers and VP). Disaster rolls may affect you or other players (more negative points; possibly lose all your goods). The game ends at the end of the round when either someone buys their 5th development, or all monuments have been built by some player(s). Most VP wins.

I much prefer video games for a civ theme. Making your civilisation with all of its perks and dangers is quite a time consuming affair. I usually am not a fan of long games when it comes to board games. Video game you can save/load, that's kind of difficult to do in a board game.
I love civ theme though and this game we actually played in a pub while having some drinks. It's fast, it feels like building a civilisation and it's not really hard to learn. The rules are simple, straight forward. And it's really fun. Just a relaxing civ board game. Although if you play it too much, you will run out of play sheets. But they're black and white, so easy to make more.
Really like this game.

A fantastic concept for a game: civ building using dice.  I probably enjoy this type of game more than most (although maybe not here-the ratings are pretty high). You almost have to use variant ending conditions.  From what I've read, a goal of seven monuments instead of five sounds about right.  Normally I favor games that play quickly.  Here I wish it was fleshed out a bit where the developments are more difficult to obtain and then you get to use them for several rounds.  I'd like to play this one some more.  Falls short of being a great game, but it's fun and one I would suggest playing myself every now and then. Update:  upped rating after playing a couple times using 7 developments as the game end condition.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is like a gamer's Yahtzee.  Each turn players roll dice up to 3 times that will accumulate them different resources that they will use to buy monuments and developments.  Whoever has earned the most points this way by the end of the game wins.

Despite the title, it doesn't feel like a dice version of Through the Ages.  It feels like Yahtzee, which is fine and this is a fun and well designed filler.  There are just other, similar, and better games available.  CV, Steam Park, and King of Tokyo to name a few.

I like this game as a good dice rolling, Yahtzee style gateway game.  I bring it out with people who might not appreciate the giant kaiju monster King of Tokyo, but also with 2 Players, a player count where KoT doesn't shine.

It doesn't have the epic feel of a civ game, but does the press your luck well.  Building and resource management is also necessary.  Even with a few plays in, I am still exploring new paths to victory.

Roll through the ages is a fun light resource game of buying developments and building monuments using a interesting dice rolling for resources mechanic.   I have played many hours of this both multiplayer and solo and have since purchased it for my iPhone.  Even though the multiplayer is mainly solitaire, the race for monuments is an interesting dynamic.  Build up your cities that give you more dice or construct early monuments for maximum points?   The developments offer interesting decisions and the game is short enough that you can replay and try those new strategies.

A quick dice rolling, civilization building game. A bit of press your luck with rolling dice, a bit of resource management with the resources gained from your dice.

Very nice dice version of Civilization. Lots of possibilities to develop in different directions, although I'm not sure whether every avenue is equally good. It seems that the first thing you need to do is build at least two additional cities. Some of the developments also seem indespensible; especially Irrigation and possibly Agriculture as well.

Anyway, I look forward to playing this more!

Like To Court the King, Roll Through the Ages is a Yahtzee clone. I like it far better though, in fact I've developed a minor addiction to it, playing a quick game or two solo when I have a few minutes to kill. The solo game takes 10 or 15 minutes, tops. With more players, it takes a bit longer, but it's still a quick game. There are optional trading rules, but we've never used them.

I'll probably give the expansion a whirl after the initial infatuation wears off, but I'm not sure I need it. If I want something longer and with more depth, I've got plenty of options. But for a quicky that keeps me away from the TV, RTtA is gold.

Well, it was kind of fun (based on a single, 2-player game), as I do love rolling some bones.  Theme-wise, there was probably about as much theme as could be packed into such a light game (which wasn't much at all), yet I wouldn't necessarily want to add any more fiddliness to a quick and easy game (meaning that I'm not super-keen on checking out any of the expansions).  Components-wise, this game is over-produced, since the rather ridiculous wooden player boards turn what should be a small and inexpensive game into an overpriced "filler" game experience.  I'm not a huge fan of the wooden dice, either; I'll take regular, engraved dice any day.  And as a final criticism, I could envision some issues with playing with the full complement of 4 players.  But it was kind of fun.  Game design: 3/5  Personal enjoyment: 2/5  Total: 5/10

RATING: 7
My kind of filler. I don't usually like having so much chance involved, but here it really works. There are a number of different paths to victory, and the dice ensure that you can't take the same one twice.

RATING: 7
[Gryphon Games 09 edition] {Civilization; dice-rolling; optimal 2-4} {Standard 6.5; Trading 7} Roll through the Ages is a remote Yahtzee variant with a civilization theme.  The theme is quite well executed; thus, it is easy to explain the game.  Unlike Yahtzee, it is not entirely a multi-solitaire dice game because player can influence when the game ends.  This creates a tension about game end and players have to find ways to maximize their scores on account of this.  This game is neither novel nor great but it suits for civilization fans who are looking for meaty game for around 15-25 minutes.

The choices offer enough tactical decisions for players, yet not taxing.   Players have to maintain a good balance in order to get high score.   Monuments offers attractive score but they do not provide additional tactical value.  Development offers both scores and strategic planning, which are more important in early games.  It's better to collect goods in the game too so as to accumulate attractive price.  Cities offer no immediate score but they provide important additional dice so that players can get more goods / foods / workers in a round; nonetheless, they had to be fed.  So, there are enough meaning choices to make this game a meaty filler.

The production is of high quality.  Wooden components are usually attractive.  The boards are sturdy and effective.  However, the dice are just so hard to read.  And, it's quite expensive!

Played 5+ times. I really like this game.  I don't mind a quick dice game and I think this is an excellent quick dice game.  We played without trading and the game felt like it was a little too quick.

I'm very eager to try the game with trading and/or with a variant that extends the game a turn or two.  With only being able to build 5 developments (4 of which you will get to use, one is probably medicine), it felt like we had just finished building our engine and all the monuments were built and the game was over.

I really like the good tracks; the increasing values are pretty clever.  Lots of little whirring pieces but they fit together very nicely and the game certainly doesn't out stay its welcome. 

** UPDATE ** now that I know how quickly the game will be over and have adjusted my expectations to the length, I really enjoy this game.  It's just about right and I'm looking forward to trying the late bronze age. 

** UPDATE ** I like the late bronze age and I just really enjoy the 30 minute dice romp that this is.

Interesting concept.  A little lighter than I'd like, but at the same time, it's not supposed to be a heavy game.  I haven't tried the "advanced" rules which includes trade, that might spice it up, though it sounds like it might make things unnecessarily complex.  

There does seem to be a bit too much downtime, depending on the players and flow.  So that's one thing that's a strike against it, I'd probably rate it higher without that element.  Maybe trade mitigates that and lets people feel more involved during other players' turns.

After one game, I think I'm hooked.  I love rolling dice, but can't stand "luck" games.  This is a heavy game with a light feeling, tough choices, a touch of luck and a civilization theme that I enjoy thoroughly.  Still waiting for the wife's verdict.

A great little Yahtzee-meets-Civilization game with fantastic dice.  The game seems to end a bit to quickly, though - pushing for 6 or 7 cities is rarely worth it as the game tends to end before you can put that extra production to good use.  There is a mini-expansion created by the designer - the Late Bronze Age - that fixes this, and all it requires is a new score pad.

I would love it if they would sell the mini-expansion pads though, I'd rather buy a pad or two than have to print them out myself.

This is a terrific light-weight game that plays incredibly quicklky and never overstays its welcome. It seems very balanced, and I've seen some great come-from-behind victories. Really my only quibble here is that the clunky, heat-stamped dice are just terrible ... ironic that the symbols on dice that are too big are still hard to read. But that complaint is with the components; the gameplay is pretty outstanding.

Played mainly as a 2-player game, but also had a couple of pleasant 3-player games. Smart theme abstraction, subtle yet meaningful player interaction and multiple victory paths make for a very enjoyable experience. I agree that the game can end a bit abruptly at times, but it's no big deal.

RATING: 7
Slick little pseudo-civ game.  Plays quick enough, and offers at least the appearance of different ways to win.  

The dice are awful though.  

UPDATE:  Well, I ended up picking up my own copy of this game.  It is the 2nd printing, with the darker dice, and the pegs all the same color.  

I am anxious to play this with the trading rules.  I finally did get Caron to play it, and we ended up playing 3 games in one night.  For what it is, which is a dice-filler, it is good.  It does not set any records for any sort of innovation, and I suppose it could be construed for Yahtzee.  I feel that is oversimplifying things a bit, and it could shed a harsh light for gamers, but I could see the comparisons.

Not a bad game system, but it's very dependent on the luck of dice. It's also completely multiplayer solitaire, which isn't a huge problem for me usually, but it just makes the game feel dull here, especially when combined with the boring presentation.

This game is well designed. And for a dice game, it actually does a good job of scratching a small (albeit, very small) strategy itch. However, where it misses is in interactivity. No matter how many players you have, it plays like a solitaire game. Do not get this if you have to have interaction in your games. As a result, I recommend it as a decent solitaire game.

A great game, that I've wanted to play every day since I got it.  I've played the solo mode several times as well.  This game is like Race for the Galaxy, as far as the right combination of luck and skill for me.  Much lighter, and quicker than Race with all the expansions, but less deep.

Update: After that initial desire to play it over and over, it definitely went down to more reasonable enjoyment.  Still a really good game, that I should get out more.

This was not my cup of tea. I know many people have been enjoying Roll Through the Ages as a fast dice filler, like Yahtzee but I suppose with a bit more going for it. I found the game to overstay its welcome, even though it didn't last very long, but still somehow managed to get boring and repetitive before it was over. The disaster mechanism, a staple of all civilization-themed games it seems, seemed flawed to me, as it randomly and significantly hurt yourself sometimes and your opponents other times. The components were large and chunky, but still disappointing because the dice were printed so faintly as to be very difficult to read. All in all, one of the biggest misses for me of the year. If I'm in the mood for a fast dice filler then I'd much rather play Sid Sackson's excellent Can't Stop.

Everybody should at least have one dice rolling game.  This one is mine.  It's dice and luck but with a real civilization building game in there too.  I'm a little torn about the freely available variation "The Late Bronze Age"... it adds more game, but at some point a dice game shouldn't be more than it is.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
A quite interesting step foward from the typical Yahtzee game: here, you also want to get types of combo rolls, but every face of the dice has use, being to get workers, goods, coins and food - the skulls can cause disasters (drought, pestilence, invasion and revolt), but also gives two goods.

In the game you have 2 main decisions after the dice stop rolling: where to use the workers and which developments to purchase. Sure, sometimes the decision is clear, being limited by the amount of goods + coins or because one big monuments is being built, and all the workers will go there, but usually the game gives you a nice set of choices.

The playtime is short - 30 to 45 minutes, with 4 players, less than 30 with 2 players.

I do recommend the variant: [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/47389/roll-through-the-ages-the-late-bronze-age]Roll Through the Ages: The Late Bronze Age[/url], the game gets better, with more options and a longer playtime that allows other strategies to be used.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This is way too random and short. If you even once have a major food shortfall or four-skull disaster you're probably out of it.

I played with just the basic game, meaning player interaction is mostly semi-accidental (rolling disasters that affect others) or building a monument before somebody else can.

There's an impressive list of developments/technologies to research, but I think that a handful of them are clearly better than the others.

The dice are too big and the print on them is often faint.

The game end is triggered by someone getting their fifth development, or all monuments being completed. You can completely calculate who is in the lead. So, if you're not in the lead, you may feel obligated to just dump workers or money because spending them would mean ending the game in your own loss. Or else you can just concede... As it can be quite calculable that you have no way of catching up.

...Played again but with the Late Bronze Age free expansion. Opinion not really changed. Got to love how you can roll three skulls, nailing the other players, [i]and you get six goods[/i] because the system is too stupid to tell whether you deserve compensation.

The game kind of reminds me of Race for the Galaxy, which I also don't like: Mostly solitaire, and you try to figure out what to keep vs. what to reroll in order to navigate the spreadsheet as efficiently as possible. I do prefer this to Race, I think, since there's only six die faces to get comfortable with rather than a whole deck of cards. On the other hand Race seems less random and more likely to see a better player win.

Played this game as part of a six game tournament. While I love resource management / build games, this one felt like I was playing alone with three other people sitting at my table. Occasionally, someone at the table would tell me to lose a point and I'd do so... Yes, I understood the game, but there's just not a lot of interaction and while you can put together strategies, if the dice say "no", well, that's that.

Roll Through the Ages is light, but drags a slight bit longer than it should in large groups.

Play tested the game at Origins 2008.  Played once on Wednesday and again on Saturday.  Both times with the same rules even though some comments left me thinking they were changing some based on feedback.  I like the idea behind this game - a quick civ-like filler game.  The dice don't bother me either.
However, I don't really see much push-your-luck since re-rolling doesn't really have much downside.  Also, there was no trading and the only interaction between the players is an occissional disaster or making sure you start a different wonder.  Hopefully they'll tweak the rules as we discussed and the way I thought we were going to play on Saturday.  Without some interaction, I don't see the game being much fun besides being a solitary exercise in maxing points.
Obviously the base game didn't change the interaction.  I have never seen a race for 5 developments done properly lose a game to someone trying another strategy.  I'll play the game, but can think of better ones for a filler.

Zivilisationsspiele dauern in der Regel mehrere Stunden, wenn nicht gar Tage. Chvatils "Im Wandel der Zeiten" schafft es auf sehr galante Weise solch ein Spiel in einen Zeitrahmen von 3 - 4 Stunden zu pressen, was jedoch immer noch sehr viel Zeit ist.
Mit Im Wandel der Zeiten: Das Bronzezeitalter liegt nun der Versuch vor, das Spielgefühl eine Zivilsation zu führen und aufzubauen in ein Würfelspiel mit 20 Minuten Spieldauer zu pressen. 
Nach der sehr negativen Erfahrung beim Siedler-Würfelspiel stellt sich natürlich die Frage ob das überhaupt gelingen kann, oder ob dies wieder vollkommen in die Hose geht.
Die Antwort lautet kurz und gut: Es klappt. Es klappt sogar so gut, dass IWdZ als Würfelspiel sogar die Kriterien eines Spiel des Jahres erfüllen würde. Sehr eingänglich, familientauglich, mit Spielern jeden Alters problemlos spielbar, nicht zu komplex, aber auch nicht zu einfach. Dieses Spiel könnte Problemlos eine Oma mit ihren Enkeln spielen, ohne dass sich einer von beiden überfordert fühlt. 
Ich bni generell gar kein Fan von Würfelspielen, aber IWdZ macht einfach alles richtig. Man kann bis zu dreimal Würfeln, um das Ergebnis herbeizführen dass man gerne hätte. Seblst die negativ Ereignisse beim Würfeln ,die eigentlich Katastrophen für die eigene Zivilisation herbeiführen würden, sind gar nicht so tragisch, da man immer hoft, vlt. dann doch noch eine mehr zu Würfeln, weil Katastrophen viele Waren bringen und viele Katastrophen bei einer ausreichenden Anzahl an Würfeln nicht einen selbst, sondern die Mitspieler treffen.

Die Aufmachung ist wie gewohnt garndios. Gespielt wird auf sehr robusten und schicken Holztafeln auf denen mit schicken Markern der Warenbestand festgehalten wird. Der Fortschritt der eigenen Zivilisation wird auf einem doppelseitig benutzbaren DIN-A4 Spielblock festgehalten.

This is a very well-implemented game. The dice-rolling mechanism is not often associated with civilization type games, but somehow, the dice in this game just works. I really enjoy how you can develop different aspects of the civilization based on your dice rolls. You have to be flexible in order to get as many victory points. Even the solo game is not terrible. The game also incorporates interaction among players by hurting other players based on specific dice rolls. Played with others only handful of times, but would recommend this to others.

Rating based on play with the Late Bronze Age expansion.  This is free and easy to print and there is no reason why anyone shouldn't use this expansion.  I see it more as a fix/errata than expansion anyway.  Upping the end game condition to 7 developments makes this game the perfect length.  Ending with 5 developments as per the original rules made the game finish just when your engine started to pick up speed robbing you of all the fun.

This is a fast and light game that gets pulled out frequently and is awlays enjoyed.

I'm not usually a fan of luck dependent games but I really dig the implementation of Roll Through the Ages.  It is very hard to get a bad roll.  Most rolls are useful and while they may not be optimal you can use them to your advantage by shifting strategies.

The game allows for some strategic planning (basically choosing which development combos you think you want to use at the start) but mostly involves a lot of tactics in reacting to what the dice end up rolling.

The developments definitely add to the replayability and I really enjoy the engine building and combos that you can get going with some of the developments.

Some say this is a civ lite some say its another Yahtzee.  They are both kind of right.  I like civ games and I even like Yahtzee so I think this is a winner.  Much deeper than Yahtzee though and maybe it's just me, but I feel like I really am "building" a civilization here.  If it's only an abstract one.

I really love the components of this game, it always gets "ooh's" and "aww's" when people see the nice, wooden dice and player-boards.

I got this game to fill-in for King of Tokyo when there's only 1 to 3 players, and it works well for that.  There's a very similar roll mechanic where you're shooting for different combo's on any given turn.

Where I'm a bit disappointed is the lack of thrill you normally get from dice-games.  Sure there's disappointment when you get that second skull and can't roll a third, but other than that, there's almost too many options to utilize dice, and so many points, it never feels like your back is against the wall, or you're hedging your bets on one lucky roll.

This light little dice rolling affair gets the nod of approval.  There's a lot of theme in this baby, but it does a good job of not letting it get in the way of a pretty light game.  It's probably not the deepest game ever, but it's fun and fast.  There are complex strategies to take, though even the tightest can be foiled by the dice.  If you're a control freak, stay away from this game, there's nothing for you here.  If you like a fast little filler with a pinch of Civ theme, you should give this one a try.

Pleasant dice rolling Civ game. Roll the dice, invest in upgrades to the number of dice you can roll, developments that give you new skills such as re-rolling, increased production etc. After a set number of improvements, add up the scores.

Quick and fun, but like most, we found it too quick. Definitely recommend one of the methods for extending the game.

RATING: 6
One game: Interesting Yahtzee variant, where players get money, goods, workers and food based on the die results. Then those workers are used to build cities and monuments, food to feed them and goods and money to buy development. And of course there are some disasters which affect the active player or the others, which makes a little bit interaction to the game. This is something I would like to play couple of times more, it could be a good longer-than-filler game, which should be relatively easy to explain.

Second game: Not that interested in anymore, ok game, but now when the mechanics and other stuff are familiar, the last impression of a civilization game has vanished.

Civ and dice didn't click for me. Civ games are about depth,planning tactics and strategies. This was all about luck of the roll. If dice rolling is going to be the primary game mechanic, I'd rather play King of Tokyo or Can't Stop.

PERMANENT PLACE IN COLLECTION

UPDATE: After 9 plays, upgraded to 8.5. I love this game. It's got nice bits, it's fast, it's strategic. Nice filler.

* A nice filler game with lots of depth. Brilliant fun solo on the iPhone, which is why I bought the physical version.

The wooden pieces are attractive and easy to transport. Would be good on a train.

Unfortunately, I didn't enjoy the physical game as much as the iPhone version. It's a math-out with no computer to help do the sums. Lots of calculating optimum strategies with the dice rolled. The effect of luck over the short game time is much lower than you'd expect for a dice game.

If you like accountancy, it's a 9 or 10. As I play the physical game two-player with my husband (who can do complex stats in his head), it's a 6 for me... I lose... And lose... And lose... Won't suit all playing groups.

I really dig this game.  It's a resource management/civ game that uses dice as a primary mechanism, but it's not strictly a dice game.  Considering that several turns in the first game involved one player spending about 5 minutes deciding what to do with his resources speaks volumes toward this game's possibilities, choices, and depth.  The interactivity, though slim, is enough to keep players from getting into an "untouchable" state, and the endgame condition of building 5 developments means that you can try different strategies between games.  The rules seem a little dense, and leave more questions than answers, but one time through the game answers a lot of those questions.  The solitaire game is interesting, if a little repetitive, and the game really meets its goals more with multiple players.  Overall, though, it's pretty impressive, and I look forward to more plays.

Players roll dice to obtain commodities and workers to build up their civilizations. Dice can be rerolled twice unless they come up as a hazard. Players use their workers to build infrastructure to support additional works or to build monuments that are worth points. At the same time commodities are gathered which allow your civilization to develop. Once all monuments or five developments are achieved by a player the game ends at the end of the round, points are counted, and a victor is declared.

Mike D's copy.  Provisional rating after one play.  Bad points: theme is pasted on.  At no point did I feel like I was guiding my civilization through history.  Player interaction is very minimal, to the point of being essentially non-existent.  Money / goods tracking is needlessly fiddly (IMO).  On the bright side the game is quick and features multiple paths to victory (read: VPs).  I'd definitely like to try this again but, as of this writing, I doubt I'd ever add this to my collection.  King of Tokyo basically does the same thing, but it's quicker, better theme, better player interaction, and vastly easier to grok for newbies / non-gamers.

[i]Roll Through the Ages[/i] lets players be as risky as they want to be, adjusting the pace of the game to their playing style and letting them try to outrun the wave of negative points that often accompanies huge hauls of goods. You can bow out of the development race to some degree to focus on city- and monument-building, but by doing so you’ll waste any coins that you roll because you either can’t afford any developments or you’ve purchased all of the cheap ones on earlier turns. As in so many other games, a balanced approach is required for success.

Quite the nifty dice game.  I like that all the sides have some use,  but you want certain combinations rather than others. 

Light game,  although all the things that happen in a turn makes it a bit clunky.  Probably speeds up with practice.

Sheet could be clearer - maybe put things in logical  order (eg developments should be below monuments),  number the cities so no need to count them, etc.

I like the crunchy bits of buying developments and their powers.

Unlike Ra the dice game,  you can lose a lot more points during the game.  Starving is not good,  but not horrific.

Makes me wonder if it would work better with simultaneous rolling and the ability to trade dice ...  would have to play with people you trust I guess.

Want to try with the Late Bronze Age.

I'm very impressed with this game.  It is NOT Yahtzee masquerading as a civilization game.  Roll Through the Ages really does feel as if you are building TOWARD something, albeit in an abstracted manner.  

The various advancements that your civilization is racing to complete are mitigated by the food you need to grow for your people.  So a balancing act follows whatever game strategy you employ.

I also enjoy the need to watch how your opponents are building their particular civilization as it impacts the avenues open to your own.  Very fun game.

The components are fantastic.  Small wooden boards with wooden pegs fit perfectly together.  A boatload of scoring sheets shows that the publisher cares about boxing up a quality game, and the dice are so large you could use them as weapons!  

The box is compact enough to take anywhere.  Every house--gaming or not--should own a copy.  Rainy day?  Set it on the table.  Vacationing?  Suitcase it without worrying about losing any room to pack other items.  Heading to a coffee house?  Great place to introduce others to the board gaming hobby.  Have no one to share your gaming time with at any particular moment?  Solo variant works perfectly. 

Roll Through the Ages is a gem.  :)

Midway through the game, after slyly cornering the ore smelting track, I invented the very first cutlass so I could dazzle my opponents with dashing displays of sword-handling.

But then one of the other players rolled triple skulls, invented the taser, and dropped me with 40,000 volts.  And all I could do was sit there and take it.  Harsh.

I wonder if the next version of the rules will fix the tasing problem.  You'd think they would have caught that in playtesting.

This game is also the game that taught me playing Solitaire isn't really as much fun as it seems. I wanted to believe that it could be, but it just wasn't. Games without social interaction lack something. I haven't been convinced otherwise yet.

If I want to play Solitaire I'll fire up Pokemon on my DS.

Wait. This sort of got off topic.

Been taking part in the playtesting version since May.  Roll Through the Ages is a fairly quick civilization lite game with a neat mechanic of using specialized dice as the way to obtain resources.  I didn't mind the push your luck feel too much because there is real decision behind whether you should stop with what you got or try one more time to get what you really need to improve your position.  I would recommend to always play with trading, as it would rob you of any sort of direct interaction otherwise.  My only reservation for it currently is its replayability.  Seems that the game is first and foremost always about maximizing the number of dice you can roll each turn, then it becomes a race to the finish by being the most efficient in either building monuments or discovering new developments.  I like it, but I don't think it's nearly substantial enough that I would want to play it again and again.

A great game with very nice components and innovative gameplay. The theme is abstract, but is present enough to be sufficient with imagination. No doubt this is the game responsible for the recent flood of dice/card adaptations of heavy eurogames, because it really pulls it off.

Muy buen juego de dados. Por ahora el mejor de esta mecánica y estilo que he probado. Buenos componentes (aunque encarecen mucho la edición).

This game has replaced all other quick games that we play. We probably play this game at least once if not more every gaming session. We use it to clean the pallet. It's the sorbet of gaming. Just played an epic game of Galaxy Trucker? Play this to clean the pallet and get ready for a more serious game of rftg. Just defeated all your enemies and became the last Lord standing in the city of Waterdeep? Maybe you should get the taste of murder out by a nice monument building game of Roll before you start to lay those tiles in Carc. This game is portable, fun, and easy to teach. Current dice obsession.

Hraji pouze po netu, ale je to jedna z her, kterou bych asi chtěl mít. I když náhoda hodu kostkou je poměrně velká, přesto se mi míra rizika zdá přiměřená.

It's an interesting take on the engine-building dice game concept.  Simply building one's engine is not enough, because another player can jam on the points successfully with a lesser engine; however, too weak an engine and you get nowhere.  Of course, as with most dice games, the key to winning is rolling well and making some good guesses along the way.

Ok dice game, nothing special but you can play solo game in 10 minutes and also multiplayer (at least with 2) doesn't take that much longer. So RttA is a simple game to kill some time.

Quite entertaining, especially considering the time investment. The expansion is even better.

After 5+ Plays (Multiplayer) & 100+ Plays (Solitaire): Very little interaction.  That said it is fun to try out different strategies, and this works quite well as a solitaire game for a good number of plays.  After a few dozen though, the ideal path is found and it becomes a lot less interesting.

Excellent dice game that actually feels like a Civ building game in a quick, light package.

This game is infinitely better than yahtzee, despite the similarities. You roll your dice, then pick which ones you’re keeping and continue until everything is locked. There are multiple uses for each die, and your strategy needs to change depending on your opponents’ tactics. The one thing I didn’t like too much was that an early inability to roll workers will put you behind, as nearly everyone goes after extra dice first.

How far can you push people into thinking your mediocre idea is in fact a great, novel and fun game? This game proves that with the right marketing strategy, pretty far...

For a dice game, this one offers a nice amount of theme and interesting choices. The cover is, to be honest, pretty offputting, but the gameplay is solid and packs lots of goodies into a short timeframe.

I really liked RTtA when I first started playing it, but it's shine really wore out fairly quickly.  I usually play solitaire, so that may be the main issue.  I like the mechanics quite a bit.  After puzzling out the various paths to victory a few times though, it stops being as entertaining.

These guys are just so innovative. The problem I have with co-operative games is that they are co-operative. i.e. everyone works together to produ e the best plan. Space Alert gets round this problem by introducing a (difficult) time limit which means you can't afford to sit around and thin about things. however, i don't like games with time limits......
So the rating sort of reflects my admiration fro the game and the fact that I struggle with it.

My favourite co-op so far by a big margin. A quick burst of frantic, exciting, puzzly fun. 

As a solo adventure: I deal out cards for 4 players separately as normal and try to co-ordinate between them with cards face-up. Although it has never failed to feel challenging (well, since the tutorials), after 10-12 games I found I was winning consistently with the white cards, so I shuffled the yellow ones in and lost three straight. That's more like it :D You have control over everything but piecing everything together in the time limit AND hand limitations gives it just the right level of crunch. I can see it being quite some plays before I win consistently enough to move onto yellows-only (and then adding the expansion!) 

As a group: I've only introduced 1 group to the tutorials so far but I must confess I took a slightly sadistic pleasure in their reactions to the extra layers that were gradually piled on. I love how you're contending with not only finding the right actions to take but communicating consistently so that you don't mess each other up. The static parts are GENIUS. And most importantly for me, I felt my solo experience did not detract from the experience of playing it as a group. In fact, I made at least one major blunder due to my lack of awareness of what others were doing (whereas before I would've worked it all out myself). 

A couple of nitpicks: I feel like you need to research the yellow threats beforehand as their effects are often not clear from the card alone. Example: Slime Y "Spread left (with 1 hit point)". The rulebook has a 4 paragraph explanation for this 6 word summary and I'll bet £10 it doesn't work how you'd think from the card alone. 
Also, the setup is a bit lopsided; maybe 5 mins setup, 10 mins play, 10 mins resolve, 5 mins pack away. I always play at least 3 games and don't mind at all, but I know it's a bug bear for some.

Bit of a wall of text there; I was pretty sure I'd like this game, but it easily exceeded my expectations. Love it!

edit: Upgraded to a 9.5 after getting the expansion, could easily rise to a 10

edit2: aaand it's a 10

Really, really enjoyed this. We played 5 or 6 missions in a row, and you can easily play the early ones multiple times, since the random elements make the game entirely different each time. The rest of the group seemed to like it, too, so we will hopefully get a fair amount more plays in. 

Really want to try with Kara and Jarrod to see if they like it as much as we did!

Sounds like an amazing and unique co-op experience.  

Own now, with the expansion--hoping to play with my RPG group next week.

Just played through the tutorial at this point. The rules are confusing, as is the tutorial -- it says to play right away, but you have no idea what's what. Silly.

This must be an issue with language translation.

Have every intention of keeping at it... things make sense, but the curve is steep at first for sure. Will revise rating with more experience.

UPDATE: Getting the hang of this. Needs more table time to be sure. This is a communication game more than anything else. It would serve as a wonderful corporate training tool.

The worst co-op I have yet played. A time limit plus an annoying noise maker of a cd means players have to talk fast and loud. It's like the players are auctioneers arguing over who's going to wash the dishes.

11/10/17 - Lowering to 8. We've kept on playing this one and while it's a great game, oh boy is it a crazy learning curve. Between plays we constantly forget rules and have to go over them. At seven plays, we're still learning rules. That's pretty crazy, given this is the same group that plays the very heaviest board games (Gallerist, Mage Knight, etc.).  So yes, I still think this is a great game, but only if you have a stable group that can take the time to really learn it. 

Enjoyable, tense game. It feels a lot like galaxy trucker (unsurprising given the same designer and them being made a year apart), although it is a significantly harder game and the rules do take a while to learn. The game is all about working as a team and coordinating actions. Once you get further into the game and get better as a team, planning for the random luck-element breakdowns becomes a bigger part of the game, A lot of things can throw plans off, so your team has to build in ways to work around those issues. Communication is a really big part of this game (telling people what cards you need, what you need during a data transfer, making sure you aren't duplicating errors, problem-solving). Great game and I would absolutely play it again & again, especially if I don't have to introduce new players to it. I know of other real-time games but there are none that feel exactly like this one, so like its Galaxy Trucker brother, it's definitely a refreshing pleasure to play.

Ein Kooperatives Spiel, welches aber als solches auch wirklich Sinn macht. Trotz Zeitdruck gilt es kooperativ zu handeln und sein Raumschiff überleben zu lassen. Jeder übernimmt eine Person im Raumschiff und nur das Zusammenspiel gewährleistet das immer zur richtigen Zeitpunkt auch genug Energie an der richtigten Stelle für Laser und Schildgeneratoren vorhanden sind. Ich habe nur die kleinste Stufe gespielt, aber die wa schon gut. Die CD nervt auch nicht, die man dabei hören muss. Man kann es aber auch über einen Spielleiter mit Karte auf Zeitdruck spielen.

Make sure that you have decent speakers connected to your CD-player.

Space Alert tackles the most common and often the biggest problem in co-operative boardgames by removing the one dominant alpha player from the equation. There just is too much going on for one person to tell everyone what to do. Thus you truly have to work as a team made up of individuals. In my book this is the greatest achievement of the game.

But the space and time where you can actually play Space Alert is very limited. First, you need a decent stereo system to play the CD. Second, there cannot be any disturbances around. Thus basically you only can play at home behind closed doors.

The game is fun but its limited playability refrains me from rating it higher.

Update:  Downgraded to a 9. Unbelievable game, but it is just too dang hard without a regular, tight group.  Rare that I survive white threats, and have never survived a W/Y mixed mission.  Experienced players simply cannot, and I understand this is by design, leverage that experience to cover new players.

Space Alert is a blast!  This co-op requires the ability to think on your feet and rapidly lay out plans with a group.  There's lots of frantic voices, and everyone leans in over the table with excitement.  In the resolution step, the whole house of cards frequently comes tumbling down when it turns out that someone miscounted or laid down the wrong card.  This one hasn't hit the table in a while, but I want to bring it out again soon.

Initial rating.  There are many things working at the same time here: cooperation, sci-fi, programmed movement, real-time, complicated combat.  It will take a few more plays to see if the game will hold up, but it seems promising right now...

Upgraded to an 8.  A truly unique boardgaming experience.  Its closest comparison is to RoboRally, but even that is a distant cousin.  It is quite difficult to teach, but the designers put an incredible amount of effort into the rulebook to support teaching.  Kudos!

A fun game that combines the programming of [GAMEID=18] with the coop of [GAMEID=30549].  The game comes down to cooperative planning under stress (time, multiple threats, sequences of actions).  The players lose only when they are unable to successfully address the presented threats.  Perfect information -- it's the timing and urgency that define the gameplay.

A lot of fun, particularly as the robotic voice of the narrator is guaranteed to interrupt and annoy other nearby games.  (Quantity of sarcasm in previous sentence may vary.)

5-player may be a bit too easy.  Space theme and implementation absolutely rock.  Fair bit of replay with the different enemies, difficulties and audio tracks, but I could see this losing its luster over time.  Overall a great game, but not one that I feel compelled to purchase.

RATING: 8.5
Space Alert is fantastic! It's unbelievable how much tension and excitement this game can pack in those 10 minutes! Of all the real-time games I have played, this one is the best by far.

If you are searching for a strategic cooperative game, this is not the right choice. Space Alert is all about adrenaline, trying to puzzle out what to do while everyone around is panicking... it's all about action! It might not be as strategic as other games, but it does the one thing a good game should do: be fun! 

I also really like the fact, that the game doesn't take itself too seriously. Space Alert can deliver some great laughter, when everybody around is shouting like mad people or when you start resolving your actions and you see how bad you messed up. Those are just fantastic moments!

This game is quick, unbelievably exciting and also a proof of what a board game can do, when there's a great designer behind it. Just brilliant! I can see myself playing this game a lot in the future.

Space Alert is the best "FTL board game version" I could think of :)
I don't know why I don't want to play it anymore, it's kind of strange, I suppose it's too heavy for me, though usually I like hardcore things.
The mechanics of the game work really well and has a lot of nice and fun parts, like getting damage in a form of broken systems and trying to predict, where the enemies would be on which turn. Feelings you get from the game are unforgettable, stressful and fun as hell. Also audio tracks on the background is a great idea.

почитал правила (обучающий 20-страничный весело написанный буклет). показалась довольно забавной игрой (хоть и на время). при этом может быть муторной (слишком много разных элементов, и сложно всё тщательно спланировать), но может оказаться и весёло-безбашенной. на двоих довольно корявый режим с двумя болванчиками. 

любопытная деталь: похоже, традиция разбивать правила на два буклета зародилась непосредственно из желания переложить на бумагу опыт обучения авторами игры новых групп тестеров. Хватил прямо про это пишет в конце буклета. в принципе логично, странно что раньше до этого не задумывались. не так широко тестировали игры?

Upon my first play of Space Alert, I thought it was a fun lark, and rated it a solid 8.5. It has since grown to become both my favourite co-op, AND my favourite game over all! And I am NOT a sci-fi fan!
While playing, it is a tactical game, where decisions need to be made on the fly. The strategy comes in after the game [!!!], as players go through the post-mortem and make plans for the NEXT time they find themselves in a similar situation as what they have just faced.
My only real complaint is that it's quite the chore introducing noobs to the game.

Fun, fast and space. Need I say more? You try to save your space ship from meteroids, aliens, computer viruses and much more. The game takes ten minutes to play plus a resolution phase that takes around ten minutes as well. Real panic and the feeling of robo rally's "what the hell happened now?" Plus it's a real tough game which makes the (not that common) wins all the more enjoyable!

:wow: What happened? :wow:

Three things that make this one of the best coop games ever:
1. There is no "one player tells everyone what to do" (though you do have to listen to the captain for coordination)
2. The scenario is always different, even when you play the same CD track.
3. You don't simply try to beat the game — you must [i]really[/i] cooperate and communicate clearly with your teammates... very tough!

And what differentiates Space Alert from other games? Real time reaction to a real time scenario. Sweet.

I don't like coop games as much as competitive games, and circumstances are usually not right for this one to hit the table.

A fun game with some learning difficulty, but once your players know how to play, games can come and go very quickly.  You plan your moves in a robo-rally type card placement, and you all work together to combat incoming threats to your ship.  You will have to time your moves out well on the turn track in order to destroy the more difficult enemies.

Cons: This game takes a decent amount of time to teach for the full rules and the players will be confused during the first couple plays.  This means that each time you introduce it to new players (which I do a lot since I have a fairly large group that changes who comes each game day) you will have to be very patient that the first 1.5 hours will be teaching, learning, and testing.

Pros: After that, the fun begins.

Semi-Con: Since it is a co-op game, you are playing against an enemy with a plan laid out to you.  Each game plays like a puzzle and all players have to understand how to solve it to win.  My Fiancee and I have trouble getting into co-op games, since they are not as dynamic, and once a good strategy is determined, the game cannot compensate.  (We prefer to play against other humans)

Pros
- Real time is fun
- Coordinating with teammates is fun
- The theme makes sense and is intense
- The game total takes about 30 minutes
- Good sense of teamwork
- No alpha player/quarterbacking for a co-op

Cons
- It takes a long time for someone to grasp the game
- Works best when played with the same people instead of teaching new players over and over 
- Need a CD player/iPhone app
- Not so much real time thinking as it is about a puzzle
- Everybody has to understand the game completely and all it's nuances for you to be successful

Sold/Traded because:
- Too many new people being introduced to the game, it's hard to get past the training missions
- The puzzle part of the game starting standing out more and more and made less thematic sense

Ouch, a 6.5? 

I really wanted to like Space Alert more than I do. First let down were the overly complex rules that make explaining it to a group a chore. The second lament came when I realized this is a 4 player only game -- lower player counts have you playing with surrogates. 

I've only played a handful of scenarios, and those were solo and with a few mates (two player each time). A few liked the idea, but it didn't feel like the game was humming along (the learning curve was never crested). 

I hope to introduce this to my core group sometime soon, but I often forget I still own it.

Really doesn't play with two and there's a lot of complicated stuff going on. My girlfriend thought we did the planning in turns and was waiting for me to decide what to do before playing her actions. I told her that it's "real-time" and that you do whatever you need to do, and if you need something from me (like moving power or something) that's when we'd need to coordinate (as in, make sure it's charged by turn three).

I'll need to get a group for this, but it's going to be hard hard hard to teach.

Very good training missions designed to teach you the mecanics of the game. You cant control everything that happens in a turn, more like doing the best out of every scenario that you can. Sort of space cadets light. 
And it only takes about 25 minutes to play a full game including setup, which is a great plus. Will be playing again. 

Played this ALOT lately. It is truely an amazing game. Quickpaced and complete panic every time. You always want to play just one more round.

As an exercise in teamwork, Space Alert is awesome fun.  Trying to coordinate your actions on board a starship under attack, with limited actions, multiple threats and playing to a soundtrack that controls the mission is both stressful and immensely enjoyable.  Trying to coordinate actions and plan your response to each threat is frenetic as you only have limited cards and time.  Once the frantic planning phase is done, you stop and step through the mission review, revealing cards to see whether you were all able to work together - most it ends with the ship being destroyed and death for the hapless crew, but it's so enjoyable to watch those desperate plans go awry because of one simple mistake.

This game is loud, hectic, chaotic and so unlike any other game I've played. It also feels like the first [i]true[/i] multiplayer coop game: Thanks to the time limit, each player needs to pull his own weight instead of a single player managing everyone's game. Challenging [i]and[/i] fun! :-)

This was better than I expected. As a rule I dislike games with gimmicks like added sound, but this one worked pretty well. Planning things and then running through the missions was entertaining. It is good and quick, but I found it a bit repetitive after the third one, so it is a game I would play but just not for too long.

A good and fun coop game, if you play with the right audience. The great thing about Space Alert is that you need every player. There is just too much to think of, which makes it impossible to play on your own. Basically, you need at least 4 players to handle all threats decently.

A true cooperative game where people have to work together to tackle the enemy.  Unlike Pandemic, you only have a limited amount of time, so one person can't just dictate what everyone should do.  We haven't even gotten to the yellow cards yet from the base set, so there is tons more to play!

Jugadas varias partidas de introducción.

Buena idea original que se queda en un caótico puzzle multijugador en tiempo real.
Las decisiones a tomar son extremadamente simples y tampoco es que rebose de tema precisamente...
Además no acaba de funcionar a no ser que uno juegue siempre con las mismas personas, ya que el método de aprendizaje paso a paso obliga a evolucionar todos a la vez, pq si un jugador tiene menos experiencia, fastidiará el puzzle de todos.
Realmente es costoso sacarlo a mesa por todo lo expuesto.
Más que un juego me parece un experimento, a mi parecer es fallido. Fue un error comprarlo.
El peor de Vlaada.

One thing about this game - you can't pull it out of the box and be able to do well.  It doesn't matter how many times you go through the rules, once in the mission, all bets are off.  And I love it.  Once I get to know the game better, it's going to be great.

For its innovation of using a real-time audio track to drive the game - this is a must play.  Extremely fun and theme filled game.  Every play has been enjoyable.  The rule book is very funny and well written.  Don't let the 8 track CD lead to think the game doesn't have huge replay.  It does out of the box.  But if you are really nervous, there are online track generators that can make an appropriate track on the fly.  Outstanding addition to an already great game.  Glad to get this on the table when it does.

Awesome game that is kind of a bummer to teach. Just as soon as you get a crew up to speed and playing the full scenarios it's time to teach someone new and start back on the intro missions.

I've been wanting to try Space Alert for a long time, and I finally got the chance to.

This game is ultimate panic-mode awesomeness. I almost don't know where to start. The time limit makes it a great Co-Op, because you don't have time to tell other people what to do (although I'm sure if you manage to actually cooperate, it makes for a much more effective crew).

The production value is high - great components... if I had one complaint it would be that the soundtrack is a little wonky.

The best game ever.

I don't like most of cooperative games because of the leader complex (these games often turn into 1-player game), but Space Alert manage to overcome this problem. There is simply no time (10 minutes real-time!) to manage all the players.

I played SA over 50 times and despite that fact I'm not a good captain for my friends (who played around 10 times). I'm better in focusing on my own job, and the captain is much less experienced than me.

As of now I am sort of in love with Space Alert.  I can't stop thinking about it.  I've yet to play one of the "full missions" (with things like internal threats, advanced threats, and stuff like that), but so far every game I've played has been unique, challenging and a total blast. 

Like Galaxy Trucker, Chvatil creates something that is both familiar yet ambitious and mixes together a sort of "perfect storm".  Space Alert creates a frantic and tense atmosphere that can't be matched.

My only problem with the game so far is that at times the ending can feel a bit like a let down after the excitement of the initial "planning" portion. The goal of simply "surviving" a mission is not all together satisfying and the "scoring" system for rating your successes feels tacked on and incomplete.

However, these are small complaints that should not distract you from sitting down with this game for a romantic evening of laser-filled, alien-zapping, chaos.

**update**
having now played my first full mission I will say this:  I love Space Alert.

a pretty good game.
Feels like a mix between Space Dealer, Galaxy Trucker, and Roborally with a pinch of Shogun (Queen).

The real time programming bit was kind of weird, but probably the most compelling part of the game.  Unfortunately, this means it also packs the part I hated about Shogun which is idle resolution of the planned steps.  A very tedious exercise in cube pushing.

A szerző nem okozott csalódást, ez egy szuper játék, a kooperatív műfajban amiket ismerek, azok közül talán egyedül a BSG veszi fel vele a versenyt, bár nincs sok közös pont a két játékban, talán csak az, hogy mindkettő stresszes (de nagyon más okból:)).
A játékszabályt olvasva (és utána játszva is) 2 játékra asszociáltam: Roborally (akciók tervezése) és Galaxis Roncsderbi (a szerző és gondolom a grafikus is ugyanaz, meg a téma is hasonló). Szerencsére ennyiben ki is merül a hasonlóság. A két említett játék nem nagy kedvencem (bár parti kategóriában nem rosszak végül is), ez viszont kifejezetten tetszett!
A játék pozitívumai: Először is rengeteg jó ötlet, ahogy a szerzőtől megszoktuk. Ebben a témában is sikerült megvalósítania, hogy minden mindennel összefüggjön. Rendkívül nagynak tűnik az újrajátszhatóság (röppályák, sok féleképp variálható fenyegetés kártyák, stb.) Felhasználóbarát az 5 féle nehézségi szint, és az ehhez készített kézikönyv (a szabálykönyvbe bele se néztem, a kéziköny egyértelmű). Van a játékban kihívás! Egy parti max fél óra! A kezdő (1.szint) ill. a haladó (2-5. szint) pályákon fixen 7 ill. 12 perc az esemény kör, a megoldás még negyed óra kb. Sok helyen hallottam, hogy cd kell hozzá, emiatt fokozottan nyelvfüggő, stb. szerencsére kaptam egy házilagos magyar fordítást, ez alapján tökéletesen fel lehetett készülni, és annyira minimális az angol (kb. 10 féle utasítás van), hogy nem szabad megijedni, főleg ha van akár 1 ember a társaságban, aki ért angolul. Egyébként hatalmas ötlet szerintem ez a fajta CD-s játékvezérlés.
Negatívum: Hangulatban azért a BSG jobb. Emellett nagyon nehéznek érzem a játékot, mi már a 2. szinten is simán kikaptunk háromból háromszor, igaz csak 3 fővel próbáltuk, úgy nehezebb, mint többen (az androiddal is kellett bíbelődnünk). Nagyon nehézzé teszi a szigorú időlimit, de épp ettől lesz tervezhető a játék hossza, és épp ezért vannak különböző szintek. 
Mindenkinek ajánlom, akinek gyorsan pörög az agya (az enyém ma nem pörgött elég gyorsan:)), nagyon egyedi és szórakoztató!

I like the games emphasis on cooperative play and team management. You have to really organize your fellow gamers to make it through the later missions.

Vlaada Chvatil is the most innovative and talented designer of the last years. I probably wrote some variation of this sentence in a half a dozen comments already...

Space Alert is the only one cooperative game I thoroughly enjoy: is FAST and FURIOUS when you try to coordinate the actions with other players in a Roborallyesque first part of the game, while you're planning your actions in spite of the many crazy things that the game throws in your face.
But if the planning part is FUN, the resolution launches laughter in orbit, especially when you discover some team member screwed up big time, and the whole mission fails in a spectacular way for someone else's incompetence!

The game is so innovative and different, and it surely needs the right group of players: both experienced and willing to be not-so-serious!
I luckily know more than handful of guys with these qualities, so Space Alert will hopefully see lots of play, now that we have discovered its awesomeness!

Vlaada for the win, again!

Space Alert is a fantastic game, because it is all about figuring out the most efficient way to operate as a team under a time crunch to mitigate both the risks that you can anticipate and the chaos that you cannot. And the thing about chaos? It's fair. When something goes wrong, you can't really be mad at anyone but yourself. When you fail a mission, it's usually because you failed to account for everything. You didn't do your math perfectly, or you didn't read the special ability of the enemy, or you forgot to pull energy from the reactor and ran out of fuel. But the game isn't impossibly difficult; it gives you ample time to account for error. You just have to give up the idea that you can perfectly account for everything that will happen.

You cannot control. You can only prepare.

This game is a blast, once you finish your first mission. The learning curve is steep, and the tutorial book, despite its best efforts, doesn't help. Past that, though, once the game starts to make sense, it's actually a very sharp game of movement, management, and making sure everyone is synchronized.

One other note: I think the game is hampered by its attempts at comedy in the rulebook. The gameplay isn't funny, and the tone of the rulebook tends to get everyone in the mindset of playing a wacky game of bumbling space cadets, when you actually need to think as a focused, unified crew to succeed.

Make sure you have a litre of coffee before playing this, you'll want all your wits about you.  It can seem mercilessly unforgiving at first, but after a few games, you'll see its inner beauty.

It's one of those games that you'll either love or hate though.. in my old gaming group, we had one person that just flat out refused to play this, even though the games are so relatively quick.

If you don't like time-based pressure games, then steer clear.

I am not a big cooperative gamer but love space games.  Heard about it on GeekSpeak and sounds cool, got to get in a play at BGG.con to make my decision whether to purchase it or not and have opted to skip it.

It's like Robo Rally Cooperative but I just did not find it that fun.

RATING: 6
Played this at BGG.Con. I thought it was interesting, but I'm glad I played it before deciding to purchase it based on the buzz. It is a nice idea, but like Space Dealer, I think it will quickly fade into the background. 

I found the game to be a mix of mechanics from Robo Ralley, Space Dealer and Galaxy Trucker. In short, if you love those games, you'll likely like this one. If you don't like any of those games, it' doubtful that this will appeal to you.

RATING: 7
Fun real-time cooperative that has you trying to keep your ship from blowing apart while fighting off attackers. I think the fun of this game really stems from the hilarity of your plans falling apart as there are so many things that can cause you to fail. This is not really a “serious” coop and you should go in expecting to fail but be happy if you win. If this game wasn’t so fiddly I would probably rate it slightly higher but you do have to manage a bunch of cards and bits all while trying to work together on your group plans.

I am confident this will rise, I need to get a copy, run some games in my home setting and then go from there, this one is frenetic in pace and relentless, and when you think you know what teamwork is, you see what has happened to all your plans, its a fun little mission in a box that can certainly bring a group closer together through the fire. Play the game coordinate your crew, watch as those plans reveal how short they are, then try it again. Never has it been so fun to be blasted to so much space debris on so regular an occasion!

RATING: 6
Tentative rating after 5 games.  Heavy emphasis on interaction and planning.  A co-op game that is VERY easy to completely mismanage.  Some might think of this game as "Stress in a box" - but I get a rush when playing it.  Thrill-seeking personality types will enjoy this.  UPDATE: Reduced some because of the learning curve and general fiddliness.  The game is relatively simple, but is so unorthodox in structure that some gamers may be turned off by it.  Even though it is an exercise in chaos management, it is a game that feels like it works better in theory than it does in practice.

RATING: 8
Like Galaxy Trucker, I was surprised how much I liked this game. It's another crazy sort of fun where I enjoy losing more than winning.  Unfortunately (as noted by a friend) the biggest problem is that you really need a group who will play several times so you can get to the "real" missions.  If you play a couple games with each group, you basically will only be playing the training missions/simulations, and that would probably get boring pretty quick.

After several plays, I realize my concern noted above is not the case.  The game is pretty simple to teach and quick to play.  Usually we play about 5 games in one sitting; the tutorial, a similuation, and then we jump to the real thing.  This game is crazy fun, and may go up to a 9.

Played this for the first time the other night. Neat game, I really like the game designer (also did Dungeon Lords and Galaxy Trucker). Game was pretty chaotic but we played with people who knew what they were doing. Fun cooperative game, the missions take about ~10minutes apiece and ~15minutes to resolve. I wish the game had been more chaotic, but it probably would be with all new people. The actual gameplay doesn't last long either since you don't do any game playing during the resolution phase.

I really like this game a lot.  The time limit coupled with the simultaneous action selection is a lot of fun.  What does hold this game back a bit is that in can take a long time to train several players into full mission mode, so often players have had enough of the game just when all of the rules have been added.  In addition it can be frustrating if 1 or 2 players seem to always play the wrong card, invoking the trip mechanism.  I don't mind losing to bad play or communication, but losing when someone always plays the wrong card, thus setting them off the intended pattern is really frustrating.

I've played this a few times during lunch at work.  It's awesome when you can get a full crew playing.  Learning the rules can be a bit daunting.

RATING: 10
An absolutely awesome romp through space.  The programmed movement is stressful especially with the audio computer distractions.  Everyone rushes to make group decisions, but no one really knows for sure if it's going to work.  The walk-through of how the events actually transpired is some of the most entertaining moments I have ever experienced in a game.  It's hilarious watching moments where people think they did one thing and actually they did the other.

That is the genius of this game in my opinion.  Unlike any other cooperative game, I can have so much fun seeing what happened, even when nothing goes right.  You spend 10 minutes programming what you'll do, but after that it's all out of your control and I can't help laughing when people go running into walls and firing cannons that don't have power, etc..  And what makes it even funnier is that sometimes, despite all these horrible mistakes, you'll still attain a victory.  A superior game playing experience that is threatening to become my favorite game of all time if I could play it more.

Hm.  About what I was expecting, but with a larger chaos factor than anticipated.  Team needs some serious planning prior to game start or else they seem likely to panic and bump heads.

Too noisy for consistent planning - better idea might be to have the communications officer listen to the track and relay the threats to another player to organize, and announce the end of phase timing.

Very different than most games I've played.  I liked many aspects of this game, including how it plays in real-time and some of the ridiculous situations that come up.  In our 4th game, one crew member "made visual confirmation out the panoramic window" on his second-to-last turn when firing a laser would have won the game.  Instead, our ship was split in half.

With a group of new players, we had 5 good rounds.  This game is even better when everyone who is playing goes through the simulations together to learn the rules.  I've upgraded my rating to an 8 (from a 7).

No game blends theme, humor, and rewarding mechanisms like Space Alert. Mistakes are punished and defeat is cruel, but that makes victory all the more rewarding.

But...this is exactly the kind of game I love to play.

OK, I am still not a fan of co-op games, but this is a good co-op with much of the feel of Galaxy Trucker (and a hint of Roborally thrown in). The CD timer adds great atmosphere and the quick replayability makes for an opportunity to avoid spending too much time suffering the fallout of a mistake.

RATING: 7
Though chaotic as it happens to be, Space Alert is lots of fun: it really gives the feeling you’re in the middle of the action while troubles (even big troubling troubles) pop up non stop. In order to hope for success, you really need one (not more, not less) player who knows the game and coordinates the others, who for their part have to obey and minimize time losses or hesitations. 
Discussions about what to do next are surely welcome yet most of times they bring defeat even nearer: more than ever, in this game time (and timing) is precious.

I watched my wife play this game and it was just obnoxious.  The guy showing them the game played the video on his laptop and it just irked everyone else trying to play games all around them.

Good but not great.  2 training & 3 regular mission with only computer crashes, missiles & serious threats (no robots yet).  Communication is key in this cooperative game, and your interaction with fellow players ultimately makes or breaks the game.  I'm a fan of most cooperative games, but this one felt a bit too much like work... mostly because of the amount of shouting and difficulty getting anyone's attention.  This game would have been a great tool for my emergency preparedness class... I'm sure that using an incident command structure would make the communication a little less painful and probably would improve efficiency of actions as well.

I love the chaos and play style of this game.  We always feel overwhelmed, and when things go wrong we're always laughing like mad fools.  A unique experience and a game I'm hoping to get to the table often!

A totally brilliant game, I've never played anything like it before!  After 24 plays it still feels very fresh and challenging.  A clear winner in the co-op games war!

Space Alert is a difficult co-op game all about attempting to tame chaos in real time. The players need to work together to survive 10 minutes in hostile space, being attacked by external threats, internal threats and malfunctions on a ship that just seems to be designed to not survive the encounter! You plan your actions in phases in time to a real time audio track that tells you when and where things happen, then you use cards from the appropriate decks to find out what exactly is going on in that area. This gives the game a ton of replayability and since there are decks with tougher encounters included, once you get good at the game you can up the challenge level. We have a great time playing this, with a lot of laughter when we're making mistakes during the resolution portion of the game, and I find that there is so much going on while the game is being played that it avoids one of the major pitfalls of just about every other co-op I've ever played: one player cannot simply dictate orders to every other player. Since everyone has to work together and communicate (except during the communications breakdowns!) and manage the action cards that they have, it does not devolve into just doing what the one player tells you to do. The rulebook is hilarious and I love the game!

RATING: 5
Only have played this game once, but it was 4 'scenarios' from a training one up to a fairly full one. I just didn't find this game enjoyable at all. We played 5 players so everyone would more or less move to 'their' section of the ship, maybe switch compartments once or twice do to something else, but it seemed to not really have much strategy at all. 

The real-time mechanic seems like it could be cool if you were playing advanced scenarios with a bunch of veterans, but as-is it surprisingly didn't do much for me. The cards you got seemed in large part to dictate what section of the ship you would go to and therefore what you would do, and so you were kind of waiting for a threat to appear in your area. I found this negates a lot of the 'real time' aspect where you should have a at least a few interesting choices to make in order to respond to the threat. Instead, at best I found you were responding in one fashion dictated by the cards you had in hand; at worst you were 'hanging around' in a section of the ship waiting for something to show up in your sector. 

I realize subsequent plays may increase this score for me, but as of now with my limited game time I have absolutely no desire to replay in hopes I like it more. There just isn't enough here in the first place to get me to want to play it again.

Truly innovative game: cooperation + real time. Communication and organizational skills are essential. The only drawback that I see is that you need pretty stable groups to play, to be able to go through the training missions and then the regular ones. This may be boring for the trainer. Well, for me it isn't. I usually teach the game mimicking the ironic spirit of the rulebook, and I have lots of fun.

Very interesting real time co-operative game. Having a cd track to guide one through the mission is great mechanic.

Willing to play more and there's definitely still challenge in the game.

Possibly the greatest co-op game created to date. The tight time frame means that no one player can afford to do everything so everyone must pull their weight to get things done. Also, it's easy to get in a couple of games in one sitting.

The resolution phase can feel a little dry at times, but it's great fun watching it all go to hell when someone misplays an order.

My big problem with this game is that unlike Escape it has a lot of things you need to explain, and due to the underlying design you have to explain it all beforehand + everyone has to remember it.

I'll start by saying that I don't generally like co-op games.  I find them all a little contrived, and really dislike how the "quarterbacking" element leads to people feeling puppet-stringed by the most experienced player.

Space Alert is the best of them all so far, IMO.   It is a fun game, whose time element helps minimize that quarterbacking problem.   Besides, if someone is ordering you around and you don't like it, you can just run around the ship sabotaging stuff and call it an accidental screw up.  Blow that ship up.

Set up and rule explanation time seems to be pretty severe, so I can't imagine acquiring this one, but I'd be more than willing to play with people who know what they're doing.

Initial Rating 7, which for me on a co-op game is like a 10.

wow, do i hate this game.  it's impossible to teach unless you have committed people playing it who ick up rules fast.  this is because there is no way to help others on their turn because action phase is in real time and you have enough to do managing your own people.  and god forbid if you're teaching it with 2 players.  i've taught with both 2 and 5 and both were utter crap.  unless a player understands what to do they feel stupid left out or both.  just say no.  chvatil's other games are really good, but this one doesn't work for my group nor my family.  goodby.

Is this a game, or a job?  Like screaming and yelling, and feeling like a schmuck when you mess up?  I'm pretty ambivalent about this game right now - that is, after having played it multiple times, but still not with all the rules yet, and only with 2.  It is hard - very hard.  We got it because of all the novelty in the design, and Ashar is into space themed stuff.  And I must say, the design is great, truly innovative, at least for a co-op.  My problem, though, is that there is little satisfaction here.  It's a screaming brain burn for 10 minutes, and then a slow unraveling of pain and mistakes for 20 minutes.  All of that is quite interesting, but fun?  VERY not sure yet.  I think it simulates the theme well, but maybe real-time warfare is not for me.  I enjoy games for the leisurely pace and the ability to contemplate, the satisfaction that comes from a well-played game, or from seeing new ways to victory.  Space Alert denies such pleasures, as the timing element makes for assured sub-optimal play, and then the unraveling of actions makes one feel very impotent.  While you can see what you can do better, you also kind of don't care once you've done so poorly.  So far, the kind of game that is objectively interesting and exciting, but when actually played and not just viewed from a distance, this one hurts.  Maybe I just don't like co-ops (except for Arkham Horror).  We'll see.  So far, though, this one hasn't generated too many warm fuzzies.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
I hated this game at first, but after a few solo plays I like it more. I still think it suffers from a timing imbalance: the first few minutes of the timed sections are almost boring because you feel like you don't have much to do. Then, halfway through the mission, things get so ridiculously overwhelming and hopeless that any potential fun gets zapped away by your own sense of catastrophic failure. Usually by minute seven I have completely lost track of which guy is going where, and sometimes the stress of it just makes me shut down. (In one solo mission I literally stopped the CD and walked away from the table in despair.)

I'm getting better at it, and I like the game more as I do. Unfortunately the learning curve still seems to be higher than the fun factor. I really want to experience the raucous hilarity that everyone else describes, so I refuse to give up just yet.

7 plays: 4 test runs, 3 simulations. Absolutely unique game experience. A ton of fun in only half an hour (really!), but very stressful, physically and psychologically. I do love this though.

Edit: This is a great game. A great game. But I think we've basically exhausted it. And going through the learning curve each time is too exhausting.

UPDATE: OK, maybe not quite. This is a clever game, but the practical obstacles - getting a group of comparable experience to get over the non-trivial learning curve and play and grow together - are simply too large in practice. I like the game, but can rarely get it played for these reasons. Sadly, it may be on the way out of my collection.
---
UPDATE: This is a rare game for which I've had to substantially upgrade my rating. I don't know if it'll hold, but I've turned the corner and come to appreciate it more. Space Alert is definitely flawed from the narrative angle - it's more cooperative problem solving than a real cooperative game per se, in that the narrative and tension management aren't great, at least not at the more moderate difficulty levels. But the problem solving is fun, and the atmosphere is good.

It does have a fairly brutal learning curve on it, though. Figure at least 5 missions to become competent. That's not a *huge* time investment at 15 minutes a mission, but that's just to become competent and get to the point that the game is fun, and everyone has to put in the time, not just most of the players - a new player on an experienced team is along for the ride and not likely to feel like they contributed anything. Like all Chvátil's stuff, it's overly chromy, tricky to teach, and more obscure than it needs to be, which is unfortunate. But once, you've got it, you've got it.

The other unfortunate problem is that any given instance of the game can be completely felled by an accidental misplayed card or misunderstanding. It shouldn't happen but it's easy to let your guard down and make a simple error. I almost wonder if the game is best played with the cards face up, just to avoid frustrating misplays that ruin the game. It doesn't seem like hiding the played cards is accomplishing very much.

But still, even with its quirkiness and fragility, I am rather fond of it and hope I can add it as a third genuinely successful cooperative game, after Lord of the Rings and Pandemic. But no question it'll appeal to a much narrower audience than either of those games.
---
Deeply disappointing. Lacks tension, thematically quite weak. An exercise in puzzle-solving and not risk management, and so almost completely lacks excitement. Also, like all other CGE games, it's over-complex given what it is. It takes 15 minutes to explain a 10 minute game, and that kind of ratio combined with time pressure makes the game incomprehensible on initial play. Also, the game is horribly susceptible to bad group dynamics in a way that games like Pandemic and Lord of the Rings aren't. Also, Red Alert has a critical flaw for a cooperative game: the most effective strategy is to pick one person to just do everything. It doesn't really have enough complexity for having multiple people look at the problem and giving their own opinions to be all that beneficial. So it seems mostly about minimizing communication friction rather than actual group problem-solving - i.e., just having one person tell everyone what to do. I want to give it another chance - there is some chance a few more plays will improve my impressions - but first impressions were a big disappointment after the wonderful Galaxy Trucker, and my rating is a lot more likely to go down than up I think.

A really cool and novel idea for a game!  The soundtrack really makes for a unique playing experience, and the game play itself is pretty interesting and fun.  Perhaps the most fun part for me is seeing how all of the teamwork plays out.  There are always groans when someone inevitably screws up the well laid plans by doing something slightly wrong, and a real sense of satisfaction when it turns out that everything went according to plan.  However, I'm not sure how much I'll play this since the skills of multitasking and organization required to play this game are pretty much the opposite of my strong points.  It's also a tad complex to unleash on any of my non-gaming friends, meaning it's pretty much reserved for play with my game group.  Still, it's really cool and I'd be happy to play it from time to time!

Updated 11/6/10.

Space Alert is a game that I've only had the pleasure of playing on a few occasions.  My wife despises cooperative games, so it is not welcome in our house.  On those occasions, however, I loved, loved, loved this game.  

I remember reading the concept and thinking that Space Alert would be little more than a space-themed version of Scene It - an unnecessary technological distraction in a game that may or may not stand on its own merit.  What I got was an awesome, chaotic, thrilling experience.  

Space Alert fits (broadly) into the Agricola archetype -- it is a game that I enjoy because of the desperate struggle against the system-imposed (as opposed to player-imposed) constraints.  Generally, my enjoyment of games in this archetype comes from the strain of complicated mental gymnastics as I attempt to puzzle out a solution.  Space Alert, however, is satisfying in a completely different way -- the frenetic pace of the planning stage is a rush in itself, despite the relatively simple programming tasks players are expected to perform.  Watching the plan put into action (usually with very unexpected results) was also extremely enjoyable (even where the plan failed, it was more amusing than frustrating).  I find this implementation of Vlaada's two-phase system miles more entertaining than the similarly structured Galaxy Trucker.

As a cooperative game, I also find it to be a significant improvement over the higher-rated Pandemic.  Here, the planning phase is fast and frantic, generating a thematically-appropriate panic.  Appropriately, success comes from trying to suppress your panic and to think and communicate clearly.  Because of the chaotic context, everyone is called upon to do what they can where they can to the best of their judgment, and there is usually neither a dominant personality, nor an implied judgment.  In Pandemic, the system unfolds on a turn-by-turn basis, giving players plenty of time to logically plan out their joint solution.  Additionally, Pandemic's epidemic system is counter-thematic: throughout the game, players come to know that the most-infected cities are no longer a threat and other, possibly uninfected, cities are upcoming.  This is not read-and-react to a swiftly unfolding disaster; this is communally deconstructing a game system and exploiting the underlying math.  Because this is more calculable and puzzle-like, it is prone to having a single, strong personality dictate group decisions, or, in the alternative, to have the group unhappily critique an individual player's sub-optimal decisions.  The result is marginalizing, and not my idea of fun.

With additional levels of complexity that I haven't even touched and the option of conducting multi-mission campaigns, Space Alert has the potential to continue to entertain me for a very long time.  It really scratches a unique gaming itch, and does so without ever leaving me feeling unsatisfied.

A great game that sort of waned over time.  Once you get pretty skilled the game gets to the point where you either have to up the difficulty to where a single mistake does your ship in, or it's too easy.  Kind of odd, but otherwise an excellent title that we enjoyed for many plays.

STRESS!!! On the plus side, if you have issues with an alpha-player who likes to quarterback everybody else's moves, this game punishes that player with a brain aneurysm. There's simply too much going on for any one player to sort it all out-- you MUST use your teammates.

RATING: 8
One of the detractions for me was the user guide. I know a lot of people praise it for being really funny, and some of it is, but sometimes the "comedy" is a male instructor picking on the female cadets or trying to sleep with them. These "jokes" made me wince, not laugh.

The game itself, though, is free from that.

What it is not free of is lots of little fiddly rules, so many that they actually teach you the game in parts, and the need to play with  at least four people.

When I played it, the game was fun. We parcel out the roles and people say I've got it and they they try to do it but it's hard to make sure that everything is timed well with the other players (a lot of actions need to be taken in sequence or at the same time to be effective).

However, I don't regularly play with four or five, I usually play with two or three, so getting together irregularly with four or five means going through the complicated rules every time, which is quite long, and we don't actually get good at the game, and if you don't get good at the game, well dying over and over again is only funny for so long considering the prep time to play this game.

So, it's probably very good for a dedicated group of four or five players, but since that isn't me, it just collected dust. Even when I was four or five it didn't necessarily get pulled out, either because of time issues, or fatigue (those rules are really complicated), or because people were interested in a specific game that wasn't Space Alert (I own many games competing for the four or five players slot).

Solo this was just silly. 

finally got a chance to play with 5 players and it was a LOT of fun.  The back and forth table talk of deciding what to do and how to manage your energy was awesome.  The resolution phase to see how everything works out was also exciting since if you make one mistake you are on pins and needles wondering if that will effect things later on.

I can see why this game is a love-it-or-hate it affair. As for me, I'm somewhere in the middle. I'm happy to play, but I have to be in the mood for something super frantic.

The game feels pretty overwhelming at first, but it only takes a game or two for everything to click. And while the game is entirely reactionary, it is not nearly as chaotic as it feels at first blush.

If you enjoy co-op games and all the fun that stress and shouting at each other can be, this is absolutely something you should play.

Lovely components and so far it looks like a really different and cute game.  The design seems to have whittled down all of the mechanisms to the bare minimum without the theme suffering and with the playability suitably enhanced by the intuitive nature of the options available.

 At time of writing I have played three training missions and while we have got better each time we havent won yet.  I am very much looking forward to giving it another go soon though.

While I enjoy the geekiness of a boardgame with an integrated soundtrack that actually works it may scare off non-gamers I think, particularly if they think that they may be forced to role-play in some way.

A problem that I see the game potentially having is that players may have a long apprentice period before a group gets good enough to play it "properly".

Plus it really needs to be played with exactly five players no more and no less in order to work properly.

A very different coop gaming experience. It clears up a dominant player because of the timed aspect, and the cards are played face down by each individual player. The game does feels chaotic, and it should, because everything is happening in real time. The play time feels just right for a game like this, and it's always fun at the end of the game to see what happens. There are plenty of scenarios and ways to play for lots of replay.

This is what Robo Rally and Galaxy Trucker should have been.  A fantastic real time, program-your-guy game that involves frantic collaboration with the other players.  I have played the 3 player game with the 4th player 'android' and I don't think I want to play without the community player.  I can see where the game can break down if one player becomes too bossy - but we didn't have that problem.  I can't wait to get into the deeper missions and layer on new game mechanics to content with - so much fun forgetting to push the computer button so the screen saver won't come up! Game gets additional points for how much I want to play again.

Alert! Alert! Tons of fun tripping over each others feet!  This is how I imagine this game playing out.  The game is least entertaining when everything goes without a hitch, and most entertaining when you make it through despite all the havok.  However, it is still very rewarding to make it through the harder levels in the expansion perfectly, which is nearly whats required.  Perfect execution or death.

[b]Includes Space Alert: The New Frontier.[/b]

Rated "9" after one solo play. I ran through this solo to prepare to teach the game to my friends. I smuggly played all my cards, moving four people around the ship, and then sat back admiring my work. Then, I replayed the events, watched all my bumbling mistakes, and barely survived as the ship was pummeled to within one point of surviving.

I can't think of a more inventive game. This is completely unique, with a sense of humor, real tension, and a fantastic rulebook that teaches the game in stages. I need to play this with 4 to 5 people to get an "official" rating, but I can't think of any other game that I've been so eager to try.

Update: Wow. Played this for the first time as a whole group, running through two trial sessions. Ouch. I think we felt collectively stunned and bludgeoned. There's a lot going on, and it requires some serious savviness to teach this to a group. Thankfully, the rulebook and tutorials try to make this as easy as possible. I think the group reaction was a mixture of dazed but willing to try this again. More plays will determine if this has staying power in the group.

Update: Took quite some time between plays, but finally got this back on the table. Five of us went from the simplest trial run to full blown internal threats and all the various actions. This is simply the most unique game I own. It's also the most exciting blend of theme and mechanics. I just love it.

The only thing that keeps me from giving this a 10 is that I can't say I'll always be playing this. You need the right crowd, and they need to share the same enthusiasm to keep it hitting the table with regularity. This game requires dedication... someting beyond the "well I'm glad I tried this" response. If that's the overall crowd reaction, this game won't get replayed.

I'm hoping I have a few fellow gamers willing to continue to investigate this one, as I'm fascinated by the pressures that the game applies, and I really want to beat the system! If I play this game only one more time, it will have been worth every penny.

An experience game that I'm a little mixed on.  It's awfully difficult, and the sonic component does make it more difficult to play.  You wouldn't think that would be a major hurdle, but I think it has prevented plays on a few occasions.  Kids are running around making noise, some other games are happening, etc, all add up to make it difficult to bring out.

RATING: 4
Rating after one play with 4: Space Alert is very unique. Of course you see some elements from games like Robo Rally or Red November, but combined with the real time mechanic the game design is great and very well done. Salute to Vlaada!
After a long (!) phase of introduction the fun can really start (and does so for quite a lot people). 
But: Although I like co-ops VERY much, this game doesn't really catch me. I don't like the real time aspect and the resulting time pressure and hectic. So I will play sporadically with my playgroup but not buy the game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I bought this game mainly because it was said to offer a good solo experience. It turned out to offer a GREAT solo experience!

Solo, I tend to win very often, planning carefully and keeping a good overview. This feels like a captain giving detailed orders to a crew (of androids in this case) and keeping the ship intact.

As a multiplayer experience, there simply is mayhem! People have no idea what someone else is doing most of the time, they perform counter-productive actions and mess up each other's plans because of it. The additional effects (like disruption of communications) add to the challenge. I tend to lose multiplayer games, but it is really a lot of fun!

Not for you if you dislike programmed actions or if you are a sore loser who cannot laugh when losing a game because someone else messed up. The people I played with laughed and shuddered at their own and others' mistakes and we had a great time! You really need to play this with people who will do their best but who do not care if it all falls apart anyway - or solo, for a nice puzzle game, really.

I've tried playing this twice, and both times it just fell completely flat on the group I was playing with.

I really prefer just having all the rules laid out in one go.

I still want to give this another try though.

Very enjoyable cooperative game. The game time defined at 30 minutes is a pretty nice feature. The theme holds up very well. 

Playing your programmed cards facedown helps to eliminate that issue of one player dominating everyone's choices. In the second phase, as the actions are revealed, inevitably people are doing things I didn't realize they would be doing.

Also, the game requires a lot of coordination to be successful....but its not easy to coordinate. Most of all though, this game is FUN. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
The game has a nice theme and pretty solid art and components. The premise is fairly straight-forward: players are hanging out on a space ship with 2 decks and 3 rooms each. In each room, there are big buttons that do things like charge the shields, and fire the guns at the various space beasties that are attacking. Guns are often too weak to kill the space critters, so firing in cooperation with the other players is often critical. Energy can run out quickly, so someone has to take care of recharging stuff lower in the ship. The goal is to survive the onslaught (primary) and take trophies (secondary).

What will probably make or break the game for the average person is the way actions are carried out, which is via programmed actions on individual player boards, and which is done "secretly," but with each player being allowed to tell everyone else what it is that they're doing. Because of the timing required for all of the moves, the table quickly becomes a mish-mash of questions, answers, and card placements. What generally ends up occurring as a result during the actions is entertaining gaffes which cascade and create all sorts of problems further down the line. It's sort of amusing, but it's also annoying to me in that making an effective plan almost requires someone giving orders to the table, or at least some sort of system because it is way too chaotic to deal with input from 4 other people at once about what they're planning to do and what they have in their hands. 

For some reason I want to liken it to a cocktail party from hell: 4 people are trying to talk to you at once while an out of control DJ is barking out nonsense through his microphone, which is annoying everyone in the room. Meanwhile the exterior of the building is being ravaged by wild animals which the guests are occasionally taking potshots at with their assault rifles.

Programmed action games are not generally my bag, and I dislike Space Alert with particular vehemence because there is so much specific communication required to do anything effectively, and yet 5 players are required which makes adequately communicating everything with the whole table incredibly frustrating. Playing with fewer would do little to clear the muddle, since then players are assigned multiple boards, which increases the amount of things to mentally process. Not my thing, at all.

Likes: Fixes what I dislike about co-op games (they become a 1-player game dominated by whoever is most experienced) by employing a real-time aspect; it really does feel chaotic while playing and players truly have to cooperate.

Played the simulation mission and I had no idea what was going on, but when the resolution phase kicked in, it all just clicked. Zany fun by Vlaada, and of course, no alpha gamer issues with the insanity. The way that setting actions works may feel just a bit artificial (why aren't we seeing the results of our actions as we're doing them?), but the game has enough substance to make the mechanics work.

WOW! This game seems really challenging. Admittedly I am still just learning and I am playing solo. It is all about time pressure and the compounding of little stumbling blocks. Perfect execution and you are ok. Make a little mistake near the start of the game and it will soon grow into catastrophic failure.

Much better played with others (especially when you get the rules sorted out). Can't wait to play it with 4. Clearly that is how it is at its best.

Not to be played by people who are looking to relax. This game will get your pulse racing and may require a mental health warning.

Space Alert is unusual game: it teaches how to communicate efficiently under stress, yet the game is more enjoyable when players are not very good at it. There is not much game there but the experience is fun. The game is fast(about 20 min) but gets repetitive. Easy to learn/teach due to step by step introduction of rules. Unfortunately, I have played only a couple of games with all the rules: by the time you reach the full rules players are getting bored. The game components look good (and IMHO the "awful" art on the board fits the experience well). Soundtracks are excellent. The space theme is well implemented.

But even more chaotic than RoboRally, which I love, but the hectic here makes it tough to really enjoy. That's probably a matter of player tactics + communication. You gotta find a way to synchronize your actions, which is tough already with 2 players - can't imagine the havoc of a 4-5 player game :)

Very difficult game to rate. I almost bought it unplayed, simply because it's from Vlaada, and I adore his recent games. But I have not had great success with co-ops, even though in my mind I feel like I am open to the idea. E.g. I bought Shadows, didn't like it and sold it. I bought Pandemic, didn't like it, and still have it. But for Vlaada. Given that Space Alert is also a little pricey, I convinced myself to at least wait and try before buying. And I'm glad I did.

I see why manny people rave about the game. The game play is MUCH more involved than your typical co-op. But for me it's too involved. That is, I'm ok with programming games (e.g. Robo Rally, and I especially like Himalaya), but my brain has a limited capacity. I can pretty much process exactly what [i]I'm[/i] going to do, over 5 stages, and maybe guess what someone else might do so far as it might affect me. But in Space Alert the group needs to keep track of what [i]everyone[/i] is going to do, through [i]12[/i] stages. And with the timer discussions are necessarily frantic. I was told that the game is best with 5 players, and maybe it is (it's what I played with in my one playing), but purely based on social dynamics, I think I would prefer frantic group discussions limited to 3 players.

I will say again that for people who genuinely like co-ops, can deal with massive amounts of planning, this knocks it out of the park. I am still very impressed with Vlaada, even though this one isn't for me personally. The variety and creativity of working together is really head and shoulders above other co-ops. In fact, I'm too lazy, but after playing this, I shuold probably go back and lower my rating for other co-ops. Lord of The Rings somehow stands alone, however, in co-ops I actually like, at least when played with private cards so there's personal responsibility.

The presentation at Spiel 2008 was a letdown for me: the computerised voice made everything difficult to understand for no good reason at all save the creation of atmosphere. There are much better ways of achieving this, but presumably there was a tight budget to adhere to.

Forward to 2009, when I played my first tutorial mission during the presentation of Space Alert to the Dutch public at the Spellenspektakel. I was briefly explained the rules&mdash;which are not that involved&mdash;and off we went. We managed to save the ship, but I will not play another game. There are several reasons. [u]First[/u], the planning phase is the funniest, as you're cooperating and talking and planning and what-not. Compared to the clean programmatical efficiency of the replay phase, it shoots the latter clear out of the water even though you need the feedback. [u]Second[/u], and far worse: the action cards which do nothing but hinder the players to force them to come up with bizarre solutions to a situation which involves nothing more complex than going to the next room and pressing a button. All sorts of micromanagement involved (energy levels, damage control, etcetera) is the kind of thing you expect a computer to do. I get the distinct impression that in the background story the astronauts decided to make saving the ship a challenge by using only their left hand and speaking a little known dialect of Klingon even the Klingons have trouble with. Unfortunately removing these cards guts the games quicker than a Tyrannosaurus rex guts his next meal. [u]Third[/u], the game is meant for groups who play sufficiently often to get to know their quirks and strong and weak points. If you consider this a game to be played occasionally, you'd be best off by not buying it at all, methinks.

All in all: a lot of creative game design, so make sure you try it at least once&mdash;but don't be surprised if the game doesn't live up to your expectations. It certainly didn't meet mine.

Great, fresh new mechanics.  Some are turned off by the real-time mechanics.  I think this game is amazing, a real work of art.  Rulebook is an amazing read.

RATING: 6.5
It's not that it isn't challenging, It's just seems a little difficult and chaotic. There is a learing curve and it's going to take a group several plays to really start clicking. Is the amount of plays required for a group to really start gelling worth the investment? I am thinking that the "running a spaceship" themed game might be left to something a little more traditional, like Battlestations, maybe.

Absolutamente fantástico. Me parece el juego cooperativo definitivo, y incluso jugándolo a single player es una auténtica maravilla. Eso si, la expansión es 100% obligatoria, sobretodo por el sistema de experiencia y especializaciones. Hacen que el juego sea... simplemente brillante, le da el aliciente para jugar, y volver a jugar. Aunque mucha gente lo teme, este juego no se hace repetitivo para nada, pues aunque solo haya 8 tracks, las cartas se roban aleatoriamente, y las partidas nunca son iguales. Aunque si no te convence, hay generadores de misiones aleatorias, así que no hay excusa. El juego base incluye 2 niveles de dificultad, cosa que se agradece porque al modo fácil le terminas pillando el truco enseguida, mientras que en normal (amarillo) las cosas se complican de una manera interesante.
Recomendado 110%, si llego a saber que era un juego así, no hubiera esperado a comprarlo en español. Para mi, el juego del año (y estamos a 3 de enero xD), grande Vlaada.

Very chaotic and too fast. So little that players can do (quantity of actions, not variety), and so little that players could accomplish. They just... survive. Unlike other co-op games where we could reach some specific goals.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Components: The board is beautiful and fun to move about in. The threat cards have lavish art and functional iconography. The robots and rockets are cool. Though the action cards are simplistic, I'm impressed with how clearly they function (e.g. the ship is colored corresponding to the direction of the arrow). All components are evocative of the theme. When this game is set up, it looks like fun is about to happen.

Experience: Awesome. We usually fail our scenarios, unless we play through the exact same scenario again, which is still fun. When unknown threats are appearing (both outside the ship and inside), it is such a mind boggle to try to keep track of where we are during which turn, whether we have the juice for another laser blast, whether a certain threat has been properly neutralized, etc. Often, playing out the pre-programmed actions can be just as exciting as programming them, because we often don't know whether we've succeeded or not. Very rich in theme.

At times a player is left with nothing in particular to do, but even being in this role myself I still have fun, because I feel like I'm on standby during a tense situation. Very chaotic as players try to communicate to each other different bits of information; feels like an entire team in the hot seat trying to respond to an emergency.

This game is a rarity among cooperatives, in that more brains are better than fewer. Yes, it's more difficult to coordinate with more players, but there is too much information for me to be able to successfully keep track of all by myself.

Playing this game requires real logistical skill, so it's difficult to be competent unless we play several times in succession and get into a groove.

Initially this game is nerve racking because the CD makes you feel like a real red alert is taking place and you feel the intensity of what an emergency might be like with out the sweat of course. After a couple of games though it slows down and you don't feel so overwhlemed. Although I'm not sure you ever really catch up. I've played it about 10 times and we've only saved the ship twice.

RATING: 9
This is an incredible experience game.  Programming actions (7 during training, 12 on regular missions) under time pressure, with random threats appearing from without and within as dictated by the soundtrack for the mission.  It has the programming of Robo-Rally, but also a lot of the feel of Galaxy Trucker (do stuff under time pressure, then see how everything turned out).  And it's cooperative.  There are a number of features that can turn people off:  cooperation, time pressure, programming actions; but if you're OK with all that, I'd bet you'll like this one.

This is a truly cooperative game. You can't win this without relying on every other person in your group and when you do win it feels great. I would only recommend playing this game with 5 players. Even the 4 player version isn't as good but it will do in a pinch.

The game packs a lot of fun into short 25 minutes sessions (not including rules).  And there is replay value because the advanced threats are extremely difficult.

After reading the rules I was impressed.
So I had to buy this one at Essen.
After opening the box: wow... 
Can't wait to get this on on the table.

So... Expectations are high. Very high.

Tonight, I played Space Alert with 2 non-gamers and it was a blast. We played the first test run 3 times before we managed to get the ship back to earth. After the 1st test run, we played the 2nd test run and finally the 1st simulation, which was quite challenging.

I can't describe it any other way than this: great game... Time pressure, different threats, planning, the beautiful components, more planning and things going horribly wrong... Fun!

Well, what can I say? The first night we played we ended up playing nine times almost in a row. We finished all tutorials and tried two real missions too. This is something that has never happened before, so a rating of 8 is a must at this point. We'll see how that develops in the future, but so far Space Alert seems to be a fast playing, rewarding and challenging experience in teamwork. Definitely recommended.

There's a lot going on in this game.  You have to plan ahead, you have to coordinate your actions with those of your friends, and you have to stay focused.  That'd be easy if the game was timed, and if the situation facing you didn't keep changing every minute.

I enjoy the chaos and relish the challenge this game represents.

pure trash.
"timer/count down" + "programmed actions" + "cooperative play" makes for a horrible abomination of a game.

Generally, I play games to 1) have fun and 2) relieve stress after work. One BGG'er described Space Alert like this: "This is an exercise in how well you can multi-task and communicate in a stressed envorinment" I agree and explains my low rating: Space Alert is stressful and not fun. A brilliant design that actually feels like you're on a starship in battle, but I don't want to feel stressed out and under pressure when gaming... I get that all day in my real-life work. Space Alert feels too much like work!

This game seems like a blast and from what I have played of it, it is. The problem is you really need to have a group of 4 people that are willing to go through the process of learning the rules with you. It is very difficult to learn this game on your own and then just explain it to people and have them play.

Pros: Highly replayable and challenging. Programming cooperatively real-time. Nothing like it out there. Cool components.

There is a learning curve but there is a tutorial manual and missions are setup that offset this entirely.

This game is so frustrating. Well, that's not true. Owning this game is so frustrating! Unless you have a set group of people play this game regularly, you won't get the full use out of it. Everytime you pull this out, you spend 20 minutes (or more) explaining the rules to everyone, then you go through a training mission and everyone enjoys it. Then you have to spend another 5-10 minutes explaining more rules, then you do another mission and everyone is happy, then you spend another 5-10 minutes explaining MORE rules, then you play another mission, then you start explaining MORE RULES and everyone says they've had enough. Rinse, repeat, 3 times or more and you'll be sick of this game. I just want a space crew!

Also, if you play the training missions with 5 players, the game is waaaaaay too easy. We had a single player play no more than 2 cards in all 7 of his actions because there just wasn't anything we needed him to do. My suggestion is to sit out if there are 5 players so 4 people can experience the frenzy. It's also more fun to watch your friends struggle through their first few missions instead of you barking orders at them.

I'd also like to have the training missions setup in baggies so I don't spend the first few minutes refamiliarizing myself with the rules and refamiliarizing myself with the setups for the training missions.

This is a fun game if only for the hectic discussion (shouting?) that results. It may only be good with a familiar group of players, since teamwork and coordination is paramount (one player per action per turn). it plays quickly however, so you can run through a number of sessions in an hour.

Might be a perfect game for a bunch of high-strung teen boys with time (and interest) to play this over and over and over.

For anyone who really enjoys taking time to think about their moves (or dislikes being forcibly rushed), this game is going to fail.

All that being said, though, the game itself has a lot going for it. It's definitely unique, great components, great theme integration and it certainly works seamlessly for what it is.

It's just not going to be for everyone. In our family of 5, for example, only two of us (the boys) wanted to pursue this game further after several test plays.

I must admit that this is my least favorite Chvátil design (although I adore his others). It's basically "[gameid=18] meets [gameid=31481]" and whether that sounds interesting to you or not, will most likely dictate whether you will like this game. 

For a 10-minute game, I think 27 total pages of rules is excessive. Granted, you don't have to read every section, but still. The conversational, sometimes humorous, style in which the tutorial rulebook is written wore thin very quickly for my group, but the same may not hold true for yours. 

The CD gimmick seems to be just that. It's basically a sand-timer with voice-over from the ship's computer. While the CD is playing, people work together in real-time to combat potential threats to the ship that are drawn from a deck. This is done using a hand of cards that can be played as movement to different areas of the ship or actions, such as fire laser, raise shields, and power the energy cores. 

Please don't avoid the game, based on my comments, particularly since I haven't played it enough yet. It all seems pretty clever, really, but for me, it was just not very engaging. With the right group, it could be a ton of fun, but I'll be busy playing [gameid=38980], thank you very much. ; )

Starting from the negative points: finding the right audience. This game requires trial and retrial that can be achieved only by regular players. In addition it requires full attention to audio which limits the plays to a fairly quiet area. 
...But the game is a perfect intersection between adrenaline and fun. The team needs to coordinate perfectly and the urge of taking action doesn't allow alpha play. The stories coming out of this game are by themselves the reward to play them.

The greatest success with the lowest expectations ever.  I thought this was gonna bomb like hell.  Never been so uncertain about introducing a game.

The game is not bad but everyone is either talking constantly so no one can hear what is going on, or no one is talking at all.  It could be the players I was playing with but I rarely had a clue of what anyone else was doing, even though I kept asking over and over.  I felt more frustration than fun and we were not even doing really hard missions.  People were doing their own thing and saying "We've got that" and I felt like I was playing multiplayer solitaire.  But then everyone would complain when no one did things in sync.  Although I usually love cooperative games, I am not really interested in playing this one again.

An entirely unique experience.  Other co-op games have always fallen flat with me.  You just sit around and discuss how to win Red November et al.  But in this one the timer makes the game.  You have to plan, and listen, and work together, and communicate, and follow through on what you say you can handle.  It is so entirely awesome.

RATING: 7
Players are crew members of a Sitting Duck class galactic survey ship cooperating and trying to keep the ship intact while the computer performs an automated 10 minute scan of the region.  Players discuss and program their actions using cards during the frantic 10 minutes, while listening to a CD track representing the computer.  The computer, while scanning the region, warns players of incoming threats, comms. blackouts, and so on.  Player actions are limited to moving between zones in their ship, or pushing buttons to activate systems (energy distribution, firing weapons, ancillary systems).  When the CD track ends, the actions are resolved to see if the ship survived intact.  Feels a bit like the last 10 minutes of your typical Star Trek episode, with bad dudes coming in, not enough energy for the shields, reactor's stressed, etc.  Very clever cooperative game, some original stuff here, and difficult to defeat the game system.  The game gradually teaches you the ships systems, beginning with weapons and energy, and easing you into rockets, interceptors, battlebots and ensuring the computer screen saver doesn't come on (love that bit).  Tons of different threats and malfunctions, and seven different "threat trajectory" templates, ensures there is a lot of replayability.  This is the third Vlaada Chvatil game I've played, and yet again, it's different and excellent.  A great set of rulebooks present the concepts in cadet training "lecture" format, and it's a funny read.  Excellent components.  It's not for everyone, but I love the originality, and am mainly playing it solitaire.  More from Vlaada, please!  Eight games in, and I'm still in the simulators - the game won't trust me with a real ship yet.

Two types of games I hate: cooperative and real-time.  This should make it a 2 or 3, but I'm giving it a 4 because I enjoy the theme and the Robo-Rally-ish programming aspect.  Still, it's a pretty unpleasant playing experience for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
If you enjoy cooperative games and have nerves of steel, this is simply the best game of its type.  In the span of 10 minutes, you absolutely WILL feel the tension of trying to keep this abysmally-designed spaceship from exploding around you, and even if you fail you'll somehow have a great time doing it as you see all of your plans unravel.  Admittedly not for everyone (see the "nerves of steel" comment above), but a fantastic game experience nonetheless.

This is just a game that makes me smile... in a cringing sort of way, after we realize that we did one point of damage too few and the space amoeba is going to eat our heads.  Can't argue with the 20-30 minute playing time either.  I worry a little that it will get formulaic, but we haven't nearly gotten there yet.

The players are aboard a space ship in dangerous territory, and must fire lasers, recharge the shields, fuel the reactors, and otherwise push the right buttons at the right time to stay alive.  The first phase is real time, during which you have ten minutes to frantically lock in all of your actions during the mission.  During the next phase, we reset the board and carefully step through everyone's actions to see what they actually did, not what they think they did.

I wish I could get my game group to play this more often, it seems like such an intersting game.

Aside from that minor problem, a well constructed and interesting game.

First play was rough. We didn't know what was going on, but be struggled through it and lost. Morale was at a low. We decided to try the next mission and lo and behold out teamwork came together. We were coordinating, shouting orders, and destroying aliens like pros. Lots of fun, and tons of replay-ability. Can't wait to try this again.

Initially, it feels innovative, as everybody scrambles to move around the ship and push action buttons by programming cards in sequence while responding to the cues on audio CD.   It might stand above the crowd in the slew of co-op games that are forthcoming for it's quickness, but my initial concern is that once you play through all the tracks on the CD there won't be much excitement about getting this game out any longer.

This is a pretty simple game in a lot of ways.  Just have to program out a dozen actions using cards, and your only options are move (left, right, up, down) and act (A, B, C).  But somehow, it's not an easy one to explain.  Too many things going on; too many possibilities for what those actions do; too many enemies with different scripts that you're figuring out how to fight.
No game better drives home the necessity for good leadership: for a commander who understands what's going on and can issue orders clearly and concisely.  They have to make sure there's enough power, that the crew are stationed around the ship, and most importantly, that the enemies are shot down quickly, before they have a chance to hurt you.
However, even if you don't have a great captain/crew and are just struggling along, the game can still be a lot of fun.  Even if you think things are going perfectly, it's possible that you missed something, and the execution phase can have some surprises in store.  Whether you're sailing through with flawless planning or crossing your fingers that your battered ship barely holds together, it's a good time.

One of the only real problems is the fact that you have to play in a quiet enough spot to hear the soundtrack, and that the quiet spot then becomes noisy once you start.  The other is the increasing difficulty/complexity of the game, once you move past the simplified tutorial mode into the main game, then add in the harder cards, then the expansion..  In order to play with these things, you kind of need a core group that plays this a minimum number of times a year.  If it sits on the shelf for too long, your skills will get rusty and you'll be starting from scratch when you pick up again.  Same if you're constantly teaching new players.  This means you won't have a chance to get better at it, and consequently will be missing out on a lot of the game.  I've still never played with the expansion, for this reason.  It just doesn't seem line the type of game people want to sink the time into, or feel like playing frequently enough to overcome this.

You see what's coming, you try to prepare for it, then you find out how much you get punished the by the game's AI. I've seen this structure in a few of Vlaada's games, and it's not my favorite. The learning curve, while intelligently planned out in the rulebook, is way, way long. Playing with less than 4 requires dummy players.

Another Vlaada entry on my list.
Elect a player as a captain, one as a communication officer and one as a tactical expert and prepare for 10mins of frenzy. 

While things are happening in real time - due to an audio track playing (cd included or mp3 on CGE website, or even written sheets on BGG if you want to keep your own pace) - you are programming your character's moves and actions, doing your best to activate the cannons in time to deal with a threat while your crew mate powers them using the generators and another one manages to activate the defensive shields..

Only after the mission is over you evaluate what happened, and discover possible missteps, often leading to disastrous consequences.
It's short, cahotic, thinky and loud at the same time. A gem.
P.S.: I wouldn't ever buy a game with a CD audio in it if it wasn't Vlaada!

After maybe ten or twelve games I've started to bore of Space Alert a little. If one player sticks their opening card the wrong way around you can all already be dead and this does happen. More than this though the puzzle has sort of melted out of the narrative story for me. I sit down at the game and see a positioning puzzle about being in the right place at the right time rather than a space ship survival sim.

This is the first cooperative game that I've really liked.  It avoids the coop's biggest turnoff for me--the alpha player telling everyone else what to do.  I felt like everyone had their part to play and no one took over.

This is a tough one for me to rate. I didn't have a proper group to fully explore the game. Heck, I've only completed the tutorial scenario. So, please take my rating with a grain of salt. I will say that this is a difficult game to teach and the fact that you need a dedicated group makes it's audience more limited than it ought to be. If you're looking for a more easier game to teach people real-time games, Fuse or Escape would probably be a better option.

Had a friend go on and on about it, finally having the 5 people needed for the game (instead of 6) and so gave it a go.

A fun game - we played 5 mission in one go! Everyone enjoyed it that much! :)

This is a very interesting game, and one of my first cooperative board game purchases. I was REALLY excited to get this game and try it out. I think it could be amazing to play if you are with the right group of people. And that's the problem, most of the people I have introduced to this game are not interested in playing it. They either are not interested in the cooperative aspect, or the stress level and fast pace of the game turns them off. Woe is me :(

Great little game if you want a real time puzzle.  You get a lot of information and have to try and figure out a solution before time runs out.  If you like logic puzzles it is near perfect.  

The complexity of the game makes it really easy to have one little mistake, like putting a card upside down, cause massive death.  

The downside seems to be that someone tends to direct traffic in order to get the best outcome, which could lead to some head butting.  Great test of teamwork skills.

RATING: 5
Space Alert is a havoc-filled communication puzzle. Players must coordinate actions across multiple rounds, neutralizing various threats, and among other things, keeping the computer awake. There are a lot of plates to spin, and everyone needs to be both independent and united for the team to succeed. While this is all well and good, it fails to coalesce into a 'fun' experience. Its certainly interesting, but all of the programmed actions culminate in a disappointingly mechanical resolution. After resolving the various actions and treats you simply win or you don't, with very little fanfare. While a real-time cooperative space bridge game is certainly an innovative premise, the lack of an appropriate climax leaves much to be desired.

Loved this game so much...but played it to the point where we couldn't lose, and even when I introduced new players to the game I was effectively running the show.  I couldn't figure out how to play without overshadowing the rest of the group; it was time to move on and I traded it Runebound.

I've played this game many times, but still have yet to play the full game -- I keep teaching it.  A very chaotic game, but fun, and best when played with people you know and with the same group over and over again.  I like cooperative games to start with, and this one has got a lot of tension right from the get-go.  It's a rollercoaster ride.  The 15 minute playing time is just right.  Initial explanation will take longer, though.  When you sit down to learn this, be prepared to take an hour or so to explore the game -- since it's a game that requires complete mastery of the rules before you start (there's no room for rules questions once the game has begun), the rules are taught in stages, and it takes 3-4 games in a row to formulate a fair opinion of the game.

It's not exactly a cooperative game either, in the sense that there isn't a lot of communication between players. The game is more about designating roles and then everyone just does their thing. Also not the most intuitive of games to grasp. You're playing the game as a learning experience as you figure out how you're really supposed to do it. After that, I'm not sure where the draw is. 

But the process of getting there is quite fun, and the theme gives a right flavour to the game. Funnily, the post-game analysis is probably more interesting than the game itself!

Few games have racked up such a string of enthusiastic accolades as Space Alert. The need for frantic cooperation under the stressful constraints of real-time pressure won't suit every gamer, and the chaotic feel and random elements do mean that some folks should just give this game a miss. But Space Alert creates a wonderfully immersive experience, and features mechanics that force players to work together in a suspenseful environment that has a genuine sense of panic which matches the theme perfectly. When played with a group of friends that share a common familiarity with the game, it offers an experience that few other games can create. The tense real-time pressure is enhanced with an audio soundtrack that adds a unique and creative element which many will appreciate and will want to come back to over and again. Vlaada Chvatil's creative genius is evident in his trademark warm humour, innovative mechanics capably serving the theme, and a compelling and memorable game experience. Games like this are a rare gem, and deserve all the praise they get. Every gamer should at least try it once.

Full review: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/1051753

Comments: RoboRally played cooperatively and on a clock.  Highly regarded co-op game, 4 or 5 players are essential, plays in 30 minutes, tense gameplay, real-time time pressure with audio adds a unique and creative element that many appreciate.  Negative comments remark on the amount of randomness, and some hatred for the audio CD, others don't like the stress of real-time play.  Is somewhat chaotic perhaps, but the theme is immersive and it should work well for teens who enjoy the challenge and the theme.

I recognize that this is an innovative game.  I get it.  But at its core it is a very simple cooperative game -- one that would not be very difficult to beat.  Added on top is then an artificial time limit which forces players to yell, shout, and bluster their way into figuring out a solution.  The game is all about the yelling and shouting.  If you like that sort of thing, then this is a good game for you.  I find it contrived and irritating.

This is a game that doesn't want you to learn how to play it. It seems like you need to learn as a group, which just isn't practical for us - I usually learn on my own and then teach everyone.

3 plays - 6: ehhh, a bit of a letdown.  Not a fan of coop games so i was hoping this one would shake things up.  Unfortunately i was so lost the first few plays that i didn't feel like i could contribute meaningfully.  I suggest starting with the tutorials, unlike what i was pushed into.

Also doesn't seem to be that much to it, pretty simple game with very little going on.  It also doesn't avoid the coop problem of more experienced players controlling what everyone should do.

I get the point is to create a bunch of noise and chaos so that things don't go well and you all have a good laugh about it, but … it's not that funny. Arranging action cards face down to melt rods and push buttons is -- yawn -- not exciting or laughable, so the game doesn't succeed for me in either sense. Perhaps if this game were about barricading yourself in a house with zombies attacking, then I might get carried away into the experience of it in a way that I'm not currently. Oh, I know, people are tired of zombies but it would make the experience more immediate. Melting rods is supposed to be fun?

It's easier to express my dislike for the game now that Escape the Cursed Temple is out. That one is also a cooperative, real-time game with a soundtrack, but it succeeds for the way you frantically do something physical (roll dice) and share things among each other (the dice) to help one another. The physicality adds energy and tension, and the sharing adds a real element of cooperation, of helping and being helpless. I'll see you over there.

Fast & frantic real-time co-op game. Requires programming reminiscent of Robo Rally. CD directs play. Tutorial missions help teach the game & ease you into the frenetic game play. Each game lasts 10 mins max (for the real-time portion). Seems a lot quicker. Loads of fun.

Out of the cooperative games I know, this is the one I enjoy the most. I really like the real-time aspect of the game, and the fact that you can only do well by effective team play. Once the soundtrack starts, there's simply no time for meta-discussions or one dominant player telling the others what to do.

A super quick co-op programming game that rewards repeat play and encourages player interaction.

I like this game much better than Galaxy Trucker.  The game play has a similar feel -- frantic real-time programming of action followed by watching events play out.  However, the game is cooperative, so events after the planning phase effect everyone as a group, elevating this well above Galaxy Trucker (where game play after the build generally only affects the guy in first).

The more I play this game, the more I enjoy it.

Nice components and some very cool mechanics such as the timing of the space ships and simplicity of space combat. 

However, the game feels quite programmed, and I'm not sure a group could win without an 'overlord' telling everyone how to program their hands. If that's the case, then it could just as easily be a solo game. I wouldn't mind playing it a few more times (we only played the beginner's scenario), but I don't see how much more we can get out of it. 

I think a game like Pandemic is the most fun I can get from a cooperative game without having to bark out orders or have them barked at me without having the fun sucked out.

It's an absolutely fun game..., only with the right crew, of course.

You have to think first about your gaming group, if you think such a game could fit. A lot of interaction and in the middle of the chaos must be still some disciplin by the members (if you really deserve to win a game), you'll have a lot of fun.

I think it's one of this love or hate games.
Only what you have to do is finding out whether this will fit to your group or not.

The mechanisms and theme come together at every point. There are of course complex rules which could be cut, but as with all of Vlaada's designs, the game is better for having them. As he is so masterful at doing, the "gamey" rules serve to compliment the theme and add to a complexity I find tasteful.
It's in [I]Space Alert[/I] that I feel Vlaada's video game developer roots really come through, and this only adds to its charm.

Many will brag that this game dispels all issues of bossy alpha-gamers, but I don't really agree. Some players will take charge, commanding others around the table to take care of threats in a specific manners, attempting to coordinate the entire team. Given how difficult Space Alert is to complete (and even more challenging to complete with a high score!), I've never been annoyed. Further, players must program their own moves, manage their own hand of cards, and should track their own resource use and player movement. Everyone may not equally coordinate every decisions, but everyone does have a lot of personal responsibility and this keeps the game very enjoyable!

This is yet another box full of awesome from Vlaada.  The tutorial missions play quickly but ramp the difficulty up nicely, introducing enough new concepts each time to keep things interesting.

I've only played with five so far ... usually there was one person without a whole lot to do, but we only made it up through lesson five (ie we didn't do the advanced tutorial introducing internal threats, or a real full mission, obviously).

I think this game has potential for real-world use as a team-building exercise.

Just like in the real world, you have to communicate effectively and quickly and delegate responsibility and make sure everybody follows through, or else you'll all die together in the cold vacuum of space.

I love this game.  I love the different things you can do throughout the game.  I love the tension and necessity to depending on others (and it's hilarious if they thought they were helping, but then ended up going in the wrong room).  I find it hard to get to the table because it takes many plays (in the same night) to get to know the full rules, so it would be best if we had a group dedicated to just playing this game (or it would be fine with a smaller library of games).

RATING: 7
Played 2 training missions, and despite knowing what the game was about, and understanding the actions, I was surprised by the game. The time spent listening to the CD and playing your cards is effectively just programming what happens. When the sound track stops, you stop, and then you go through a checklist of the sequenced actions, and find out what the team really did! Most peculiar! A sort of Robo Rally, but very condensed. The training missions gave us lots more actions and safer enemies, but we still lost badly twice. The cards have very very simple symbols, up/down, left/right, or A B or C. The programming was extreemly simple. But getting the 4 players in the right place at the right time was maddening. Definitely want to play this again.

Space Alert is definitely the most unique game in my collection, delivering an experience very different from most other boardgames. The real-time element is the main source of challenge in the game, and requires good teamwork and communication from the players. The mechanics can be complicated but are not overly so, and the variety of threats provide good replayability. While it's not a game that I'm always up for playing (one needs to be in the mood for fast-paced action and chaos), it's always a blast when I do.

Played 2 times with 4 and 5 players.

I don't even remember my first play of this game, but...

JUNE 2014 - I love some of the ideas in this game but hate the gameplay. Vlaada seems to be the king of soulless, overly fiddly euros. This is a wildly different game from Dungeon Lords, but I hate the intensely obvious euro-symmetry going going on. It doesn't help that I dislike real-time games (I feel most of them are best suited to video games), but Dungeon Lords isn't real-time, and I feel the same way about it.

I actually left a game night when this was what was staying on the table. It still suffers from Alpha player syndrome (actually, more like Alpha and Beta syndrome in my last playing), and I don't find the game nearly interesting enough to care. This ship is 5/2 move 2, that ship is 8/2 move 1, and move left move down use some action - bleh.

I'm done with Vlaada's games. Seriously. I don't have much time to game now that I'm older and I'm suck of wasting two hours of precious gaming time on his designs.

Want real-time? Play Speed.
Want Co-op battles? Play Lord of the Rings The Card Game.
Want programmed actions? Play Robo Rally.
Want sci-fi battles? Play Eclipse.

Nothing (and I mean nothing) about the gameplay works for me).

Because of the timer, play is a little hectic & chaotic, and you have to yell sometimes to get your two cents in.   6 plays and we have never lost with 4 players.  One of our players who has played with 5 and said it was very hard, speculated that it is much harder with 5 players since 2-3 more threats arrive.

Pros
-Short game length (10min play+10min resolution)
-Fairly easy to teach (game includes several tutorial missions)
-Hilarious (best) rulebook I've read
-Innovative, real time and use of audio tracks
-Cooperative game where alpha player is almost a non-issue. It is almost impossible for a single player to micromanage due to real time aspect and hidden card info
-Reasonable difficulty level that is very scalable/customizable (especially with expansion). 
-Good variability on cards/enemies
-Good replayability despite drawing scenarios from fixed audio tracks (apps also provide randomized tracks)

Cons
-2 and 3 player modes feel tacked on. Game optimally requires 4 or 5 players
-Not all players will find chaos and plans backfiring entertaining
-Possibly repetitive if played a lot, or players start memorizing where enemies appear (highly unlikely)
-Could probably use slightly more variations of commands beyond "communications down", "incoming data", and "transfer data".
-Without expansion, no character powers between players (only 1 heroic action) and no real campaign mode/character growth (both added in expansion)

RATING: 9
Fantastic, innovative game that's truly cooperative without artificial information hiding rules, and that requires coordination and communication. It's Galaxy Trucker plus Roborally, and I like the Galaxy Trucker-related art.

Duration: Each mission is around 10 minutes of intense cooperation and communication.
Design: Amazing that no one has done anything like it! The real-time nature of the game ameliorates the "bossy player" problem in co-op games.
Strategy: The way to get better is to have the group become familiar with the game and learn to communicate effectively.
Components: Colourful pieces with some Galaxy Trucker cameos. The limited missions on the CDs would be a problem without the community.
Theme: Even though you're just programming movements and activations, the real-time aspect of the game gives you a crisis feel.

No game is as much pure fun as Space Alert. There is just nothing out there quite like this. The co-op elements, the frantic pace, and the straight up sillyness make this a must have in my opinion. Best of all, games only take about 10-15 mins.

I think this is one of my favourite games. But I'm not sure, because I never get to play it as much as I want to. This is a game that takes some practice and almost requires a dedicated group that plays the game over and over, and I haven't found that group yet.

[5 plays] I think this is about as good as cooperative games can get.  People have to act somewhat autonomously while still working as a cohesive group.  It mostly solves any coop game issues of one person dominating the decision making by forcing the captain to delegate.  

The major downside is bringing people up to speed.  I'm confident it's going to work out well, though, and if it does, my rating may go up.

Loads of fun!  Have only played the first 2 tutorial missions so far, but it's a very unique game and it works incredibly well!  Probably my favourite fully cooperative game I've played so far.  I'm thinking my score will go up after further plays.

EDIT:  Score actually dropped after further plays.  With 5 players, this game is frustrating, and not in the fun way that Galaxy Trucker is.  Would still like to give it another go to see how well it is with other numbers of players.  So far I enjoyed it with 3 players, but did not enjoy it with 5.

The thrill of the first few games is hard to replicate. You will absolutely adore the game and then it will start to seem a little old hat. It's got tons of good material to mine for sure, but the adrenaline-fueled chaos of the first games is irretrievable. I feel like I'm chasing the dragon.

Regardless, my favorite take on co-op games. The play in most co-op games turns into a big, slow ball of group-think, but when you put a timer on people and hinder the flow of information you actually get to the core of the genre: effective communication.

Cooperative game with simultanous action selection. It definitely captures the feel of players being crewman on a starship.

I definitely want to try this one again.

RATING: 8
A very innovative cooperative programming game in real time. The real-time aspect cleverly avoids one of the pitfalls of other coop games, namely one player telling everyone else what to do. Here, you simply don't have enough time. Players program a number of actions in order to save the spaceship from attacking aliens or other such threats. Only when these steps get resolved after the end of the mission they will get to know whether they succeeded - and it is quite easy to send the ship to its doom by one careless move.

Planning your steps can be a hectic endeavour. Often you must endure being shouted at. In short, this is nothing for the faint-hearted. In fact, the game is also rather inaccessible which is unexpected in a coop. New players need to learn the ropes by going through the training missions which I suppose can get rather frustrating for experienced players. On the other hand, skipping the training would be rather frustrating for the newbies (and possibly for the veterans, too, due to all the stupid mistakes being made). I guess what all of this means is that to really get the full enjoyment out of this game you need to be playing repeatedly with the same group of people. You cannot just bring in a new player and launch into space right away.

When you do have that kind of group I can imagine this being lots of fun, though. I just wish the announcer's voice from the CD wasn't so terribly distorted. I guess in this case unfortunately theme won over function.

This may be my favorite cooperative game. you need a music player to play (it comes with 2 discs). you should play this with a care group of people and start them all at the same time. one person should know what is going on and act as the captain to introduce everyone else to the game. I found that introducing a new player when the majority already knows what they are doing is frustrating for all parties. the game is almost more fun to crash and burn than it is to win. If you find yourself winning too frequently, you have to add more to the game to keep it challenging. The game should always be challenging to the point where you don't know it you will make it and if you aren't sure, make it more difficult just to be sure.

Fun cooperative game.  Rule book is a mess though, as they tried to be cute with a tutorial book that teaches baby steps to get to the game.  The real rulebook is then not complete as some rules are only found in the tutorial.

RATING: 6
Unfortunately, I walked away feeling rather "meh" about the whole experience. Space Alert didn't let me down for what I thought I would find: an interesting timer component and awesome theme. What I didn't care for was the combination of the puzzly nature of it all, and the chaos. I have experienced Chvatil's puzzle-like mechanic before in Dungeon Lords. While I find the DL system too complex to get any real enjoyment out of it, it is still a quality game and a well thought-out one. In fact, the puzzle aspect of it was unlike any other game I've played. SA also has this feel, but one mis-step from either you or an opponent means that everything you planned for is delayed by one round. This means that all the careful planning that went into the game gets fucked, and you just have to keep your fingers crossed that everything works out okay. I really didn't like this aspect; the whole first 10 minutes of planning is chaotic enough, but interesting for a co-op game. I felt like all our planning was for nothing. as a mis-step (easily made with all the chaos) delayed everything, and a Giant Octopus ripped our ship to shreds because of it. A little chaos keeps things interesting, but too much of it takes away from a big aspect of games that I like: the ability to control the system in the face of particular difficulty. SA was full of random chaos, and I didn't think there was any way to take control of it. I'm sure with repeated plays and a solid understanding of the game, one would do much better. But after my first experience, I don't care to get better at this one. Oh well!

Big ifs on this one right now.  Even after three plays, upping the difficulty each time, it seems really easy.  We haven't played the full scenario yet and we're not even close to having more than one threat even cause damage.

It's possible that having 5 people makes the game much easier, and it's best with 4.

A time-constrained game that forces you and your crew to literally make the right choices at the right time. There's so many problems, so much you can do and yet so little time. Makes for a chaotic, screamy game night. Great game if played with the right people.

Ok. So... the game is something very special and totally different from what I've seen previously, ever.
This is a good thing, cause it is a completely different coop than any other.
But, on the other hand it creates huge chaos in the first games and you need the same crew to play next games, so... I don't know how long will it live.

Wow the audio CD is a really cool "out of the box" mechanic...I am a big fan of how it solves the hive mind problem and the AP problem of most cooperative games: by putting you on a strict, unknown timeline, and having sections of time where everyone has the STFU.  Really want to play this some more.

Might have longevity problems though, as you run through all the tracks on the CD.

[b][i]Space Alert[/i][/b] is a great team game where a group works to keep a struggling spaceship alive for a real-time 10 minutes (the game has a recording sending waves of baddies your way). Strategy is not wide spread, at least not in a traditional sense. Instead, games are won or lost based on how well your team works together and communicates on vital details such as are there 4 or 5 energy in the main reactor. Expect to laugh as your space ship is destroyed by a Giant Octopus because [i]somebody[/i] mis-timed their cannon fire.

My rating is subject to change after I play this game some more.

I generally dislike cooperative games.  Generally it is the more social people who want to play it and there is always the one guy (me) who knows the rules and needs to explain it and often knows the strategies.  So often, cooperative games turn into that one guy suggesting what everyone does or letting people fend for themselves and watching the game implode.  Neither option is fun for me.

Space Alert does not have that problem at all.  You just don't have time to micromanage people.  Maybe as I play it more, this will change.  I really hope not, because I really enjoy this game the few times I have played it.

I think the mechanics are good and I like the flavor that the rulebook puts into the game.  Something as small as the "ooops, I tripped" rule is fantastic and adds a lot to the game.

Wow, this game is amazing so far. We played the tutorial game, and then instantly played 3 more games in the space of two hours. Everyone, even 1 non-gamer, loved the game completely. Stress, teamwork, and good fun abound here. Check it out if you can.
I've also played about 8 games solo, 4 in-a-row at a time. Doesn't get repetitive, and it's actually a lot of fun!
After repeated plays, this game is just amazing.  It's a little frustrating to teach to new players, because playing tutorial scenarios bores the experts, and playing advanced scenarios massacres the beginners.
But hey, my wife and I played a two player game with bots, and it worked pretty damn well. Can't wait for the expansion to make things even more deadly!

There is a difference between random and chaotic. This game falls on the random side and is therefor on it's way out of my collection.

We were expecting a fun romp, a la Galaxy Trucker, and what we got was a random handful of cards which have a significant chance of dooming you. And it's obvious you don't have a chance as soon as you pick up your hand. Ten minutes is still too long when it's pointless.

Until you actually go through the steps and realize how much everyone actually messed up that you all literally made the ship destroy itself buy running around like a chicken with its head cut off. Yup, that kind of game. I always recommend at least 4 people min because it's annoying managing the android player if playing with 3 people. You'll see what I mean

I've played Space Alert a bunch of times now, and still have some unresolved feelings about the game. I admire it. But I go back and forth on the question of whether I actually enjoy it. Mostly, I do enjoy it. However, it's a difficult, stressful, often frustrating game. I guess that's both its weakness and its strength.

I definitely don't enjoy teaching the game to new players. There's a lot to explain, and it tends to befuddle new cadets. But with people who already know how to play, or have at least observed the game being played, it's a lot of fun.

I also find that the game is a hassle to set up and put away. That might seem like a dumb issue to raise, but it does keep me from suggesting it more often. There are a lot of little fiddly pieces and decks and tokens and markers and boards for such a short game.

Despite these issues, Space Alert is a captivating game that's unlike any other I've played. It's as much a sociology experiment as it is a game. In other cooperative games, there's the potential for one player to bully the others, trying to control all aspects of the game himself. This is simply not possible with Space Alert. The game is played in real time, and it won't be possible to execute a perfect plan. Each player will be scurrying around the ship trying to put out fires while trying to stay in communication with the rest of the team. Some coordination of effort is necessary, but there's not enough time to carefully map out everyone's moves. And inevitably, you'll screw something up or forget something or time your action incorrectly or run out of power or try to use a gravlift at the same time as someone else. Honestly, I think it's more fun to lose this game than to win.

So far, we've mostly played our cards face up on the action boards. Otherwise, it's too hard to keep track of what you're doing and where you are on the ship. As we get better, we might flip them upside down, but so far we prefer to keep them exposed.

Not sure on this one. I like the idea and I enjoyed playing it, but it is the kind of game that you need to play several times with the same group of people like Battlestations or Road to Legend. That always makes it hard with my game group who don't usually want to play the same thing twice and has variable number of members present half the time.
I still hold out hope for it though. If you play it without going through the practice sessions, someone is bound to make a huge mistake here or there and disaster will ensue. The board and pieces are very cool looking.

Work.
That's what this game feels like.
Work.
Not exciting "space-exploration" kinda work. More like civil-servant, office-politics "file this in triplicate" work.
I wanted this game for a LONG time, and couldn't wait to introduce it to my friends. We've only played the practice missions, and now it sits there on the shelf, a reminder of past mistakes.
Just like an illicit affair with that red-head from accounting, you'll find yourself regretting this.
Not that it doesn't try. I mean, just like that hottie red-head, it's got everything going for it; a great sense of humor, first and foremost. The rule book introduces you to the world of this game like a coy glance over coffee. It's sublime in how it attracts you with it's affectionate attitude, and quick-witted remarks, slowly luring you in by introducing mechanics and components, like toys in a secret "Red Room." After a few tentative plays, you'll find that you're trying to carve out time for this new excursion in your already hectic life, and you'll have trouble trying to convince your friends that your relationship with Space Alert is just harmless fun.
But they know.
They know it'll all end in a mug-throwing tantrum in the break room, and that you'll be standing there, with everyone looking at you, as you slowly realize you have to make that call to your spouse before someone else does, because everything is about to get worse...wait, where was I going with this?
Oh, yeah. This game is WORK. It's very funny, but you spend most of your time in the game getting things wrong, which isn't as funny as much as it's frustrating. You were in the wrong place at the wrong time. You were expecting something to happen when you pushed all those buttons, but nothing happened. Ultimately, your bad decisions and choices caused the destruction of the entire vessel, and her crew, not to mention loosing your children's college funds in a messy divorce.
Wait. What?
This review keeps getting away from me. Let me focus:
You program your moves, a la Robo Rally, while a CD plays a prerecorded track of incoming threats to your little sitting-duck class ship that just warped into this quadrant for a "quicky" sector scan. Suddenly, like George Lucas making a surprise appearance at a screening of The Force Awakens, everything and everyone wants to kill you. But, if you and your friends can communicate effectively, and plan accordingly, you might survive long enough for the automatic warp drive to zap you out of here in ten, real-time, minutes.
But that's misleading. The CD runs for 10 minutes while you run here and there, try to allocate energy, fire weapons, and keep the internal and external threats managed. But your doing it all by programming your moves and actions with cards that aren't revealed until the CD stops, and you painstakingly recreate the event step-by-step. That process takes a lot longer than 10 minutes, and it's here that you realized you messed up: you didn't put down the right card, two of you tried to use the one-man lift in the same section, and you left Becky's telephone number in your jacket pocket. 
This would have been amazing if it all could actually happen in "real-time." But the "do-over" sense of recreating the actual event kills the mood.
Space Cadets is a game that does this better, but with fiddly, dexterity based mini-games. And both games are a PAIN to teach.
If you have the same group playing over and over, you can actually get good at Space Alert, but to convince someone to finish a day of mind-numbing employment and then come over to your house to PLAY A GAME which simulates frustration and incompetence, it's a tough sell.
I really wanted to love it. I really did. But like your feelings for the red-head in accounting, some things are better left on the shelf.

This is one of the most unusual games I have tried and I had a blast. In the past I would say that cooperative games aren’t my kind of games, but Pandemic and this has made me change my mind. In Shadows over Camelot and Lord of the Rings I don’t feel I cooperate, more doing my own things, in this it is crucial to do things together. The timer makes you do things wrong. It’s hectic, but not too much, just enough so you can’t sit still. I played this as a team event during a convention between three other teams and you really feel the team aspect and winner instinct in the game, a cooperative competition. 

I played with four other players and I think that is the way to go as it seems just more interesting that way.

Take the "Program your steps" mecanism from Robo Rally but don't use it just for moving but also pushing buttons (aka releasing actions) and combine it with a real time cooperative task to solve.
What actually sounds like an easy fun game is a [b]hard to master logistics challenge[/b]!!! Oh man, even the two introductory missions are not easy. Acutally I can't imagine to master advanved missions with more enemies or breakdowns on my station. Furthermore the team that tries to beat the game must be able to communicate in an efficient way otherwise again; no chance to win. Really, it's a very long time such a difficult game came my way. Just a slight mistake (a tribute to be under time pressure) and you lose! Game over. Yes, I would rate it higher if it was easier.

Edit after 3 plays: not my cup of tea, but I refrain from downrating it because I find it a clever variant of tower defense games.

A classic. I miss having a crew I can play consistently with, though much of the design is intended to allow experienced players to mingle with newer ones.

Update: A few years on, I just don't have the energy to teach this game anymore. It takes so long, and after playing 50 times myself, I don't actually have that much fun with new players. I hate to accept it, but it's true.

Pure Genius.  The game comes in two stages, a timed planning stage and then a hilarious implementation phase.  The pressure of the planning stages and making sure everything is heard and all the enemies are engaged makes you feel really smart.  Then you go into the implementation phase and realized you all look like a bunch of idiots.  It's really great.

Despite my absolutely HATING the both rulebooks, this is a fun game, crazy and frantic while still being light and fun. It's nice that you can make it more difficult when things start getting too easy: you can always have that feeling of "we're all gonna die cuz I don't know what the heck I should be doing!". Great with a group of friends who don't mind losing every game and yelling at each other to "please, for the love of God, somebody charge my laser cannon!!!".

I need to play this more, but it's a hard game to get to the table.  You need a quiet room with a CD player (or the .mp3 files and an iPhone), and it's too loud if there are other games going on simultaneously.  It takes a very long time to teach, especially if you have to go through the training missions with newbies.  I love it so, but it just doesn't get the play time.

Despite not going to Essen in 08, I was able to get hold of a copy from Shire Games. Played it for the first time  on 25/11/08 and absolutely loved the game... we enjoyed it so much, we played 4 straight games of it (3 on the training CD and 1 from the Mission CD). Co-operative goodness that plays in about 30 intense minutes (including resolution etc.) Loads of fun and extremely high replayability... Best with 4 or 5 players, but I still find it works well with 1 to 3 players... solo is pretty hard and more of a puzzle than an exercise in teamwork, but sitll very enjoyable.

Without a doubt this is my number 1 favourite game.. 

Possibility for expansions, either with a new CD, or with new threat cards.

It is basically the mix of a well-known system (action programmation -and very simple actions: move, shoot, reload) and real-time stress, in a cooperative frame. 
Even if none of the ingredients are new, the result has its own flavour and works very well -and the random cards and threat-track is a good idea, that allows you to replay the game quite often. 
Nice flashy sci-fi components.

This feels like what a co-op should be to me.  To succeed, players must communicate and coordinate with one another due to the mechanics.  Practice and team-building will directly correlate to success - shouldn't that be what co-ops are all about?

RATING: 3
What was I thinking when I got this? Well, I like Science-Fiction, the game is pretty and the new edition with translucent cubes made me finally pull the trigger, but there were reasons for not having bought it earlier. I'm not particularly fond of the cooperative genre, and I usually dislike games where the players simultaneously program their whole series of actions for the round. Here, they program the entire game! And they do it collectively to solve an unforgiving puzzle... in ten minutes!

The game is not easy and includes a tutorial that takes the players through several lessons, test runs and simulations to prepare them for the real thing. A problem with this is that you have to play always with the same group if you expect to have a good performance. Besides, as it often happens with Vlaada's designs, the game scales poorly with the number of players and requires the use of dummies with two or three. It is worse than usual, because the players must collectively control these so-called androids in the same ten minutes!

The saddest thing for me is that obviously a lot of effort was put into the design, and it might have been a decent game if it was supposed to be played in the traditional turn-based way. Also, I came to the conclusion that the real-time playing was false advertising, as you don't actually play the game in those ten minutes, in the sense that you perform actions and see their results. You just program them, and if not for some new info and instructions given by the CD, the game would be nothing more than a puzzle with a time limit.

What makes Space Alert so great is that the real time gameplay eliminates two gaming pratfalls: 1) Analysis Paralysis - a player simply cannot take forever on their turn, debating how to maximize it to the fullest. 2) Quarterbacking - one of the problems I have with Pandemic is that an extremely vocal/dominant player can simply orchestrate other players' turns for them, certain players can just tune out if they want to while the others move their piece for them because there are more clearly defined "correct moves."  Space Alert is just chaos!  It's quick, it's challenging, it's utterly unique.

Less madcap, and hence probably less fun, than its real-time predecessor Galaxy Trucker. It is awfully fun nonetheless, and it offers a deliciously unique take on co-op games. It has a couple of personal strikes against it, though;
a) I hate programmed actions. This is by far my favourite of them, but I hate the mechanic.
b) I dislike games where tutorial sessions are mandatory. Despite being simple, there are lots of little details to Space Alert, and so the tutorial sessions are a must.

A cooperative game, so it's never going to be a big hit with me.  The inital part of the game with the CD is chaotic and fun, but the second part when you play out the results dragged for me.  Perhaps it just takes a few games to get familiar with the rules and then things would speed up.

I'm not typically a fan of cooperative games, pre-plannned movement games, or real-time games, so your mileage may vary. However, I did like the setting. I like the way that, more than most other cooperatives, it really forces players to work together. Unfortunately, it's one of those things that given sufficient time you could easily win every time, so it's really just a race against the clock (and possibly the cards in your hand). It fits the theme well, but I'd rather play something else. It is very satisfying to see the plan come together, but it's mostly just chaotic. There's not much in the way of real strategy here, just fast-paced, chaotic teamwork. Not really my thing.

Very thematic, soundtrack adds to the gaming experience.  Robotic voice is easy to understand on DVD, and an MP3 file is available for download if you prefer using a PC.

We had two players sitting besides the DVD player, one would handle outside threats, the other inside threats.  Worked quite well, as the Communication Officer would repeat the information.

First time out we played [b]TEN[/b] 5-player games in a row (don't recall ever doing that before!), starting off with the intro games and moving up.  The self training approach was very nicely done.

Highly recommend this game if you are into coop games.  It is a cross between [GAMEID=18] and [GAMEID=12350], in the [GAMEID=31481] universe!

Some will like the intensity imparted by the short play time and the CD works great as a timer and announcer of special events. It can't get bogged down in analysis as with other co-op games which is a big plus. Still, it feels like just a bit too much effort for the satisfaction gained from playing it well. It is an interesting experience but it can be a bit taxing and I find I don't really want to play it very much. It is a very clever game but just not my thing.

So much more than a mere game—this is an amazing artifact, a tool, in the exercise of teamwork, planning, and unforeseen consequences.  Seriously—it could be used for real-life team training.

But before you wave off because you're worried you'll be forced to play this with your boss at a corporate retreat, know that it's tense, trying (in the good way) and most of all fun.  The theme is hard-SF enough to feel serious, with just a dusting of levity that never becomes cartoony (something that turns me off of [i]Galaxy Trucker[/i]).

I was worried the audio track would be goofy and kitschy, but instead I found it to be brilliantly immersive.

It seemed like a simple game made way too complicated by a poorly done soundtrack in attempt to give an artifical time presure and added chaos.

I must confess this wasn't really what I was expecting. I thought that the players would have to react to challenges in real time, including movement and actions. Instead the soundtrack is just a glorified sand timer while players program their movements, then at the end of the game the moves are gone through to 'see how you did'. None of this is exciting or stimulating, it's just an exercise in how well a group of people can communicate. Computer games do this so much better.

This is really pretty brilliant--the idea is to make a cooperative game where the difficult part is the cooperation itself.  It eliminates a lot of problems with cooperative games in general--the one-player issue, the artificiality of the challenges, and the boring repitition of many co-ops.  Instead, it's all about cooperative negotiation.

However, the negotiation is pretty chaotic and it can be very frustrating to try to form a plan with four other people at once while they are also working with each other.  It's stressful and kind of exhausting.  (1 play)

Fast, frantic and fun. Easy to teach, and fast to get everyone on board. Really brings out the personalities of the people you're playing with. 

Good amount of tactics, and planning involved. Luck is minimal but plays a part in the hands that you're dealt. There is a chess aspect, where you have to think a few steps ahead. You have to be on your toes to digest all the information given to you from your fellow players and the threats encountered to make it through the game alive.

Played only 4 times, but cannot wait to play more.

After 2 plays:
If this game ended after the soundtrack stopped, I'd rate it several points higher. Sadly, once you're done "playing," you have to go through the entire game a second time and re-enact the whole thing "for reals this time." The last half of the experience is just watching as everybody reveals a card, one person pushes a few cubes around on the board, and then you reveal cards again, push more cubes, repeat until you've done it a dozen times. This game would be _perfect_ for couch co-op on the Xbox or something. You can yell at each other for 10 minutes while the timer ticks down, and then it zips through all the mechanical cube pushing and laser shooting and damage dealing in one or two minutes. I don't know that it would be great for me this way either (I'm only ok at best on the real-time portion), but I'd be willing to play it a few more times and find out. With the boring play-it-again-Sam portion tacked on, I don't know that I'd give it another chance.

A very original cooperative game.  The implementation of a CD audio track to put pressure on players, combined with keeping track of hidden actions, makes this game really tense and exciting.  It seems simple at first glance, but wait until the reactor runs out of energy and you find yourself firing blanks at the incoming aliens!

Gets better with more plays.  If you don't have a group that is willing to commit to playing it over and over in a relatively short time period (say, 10 games over a couple months), then it might not be for you.  But it's worth the time commitment, imho.

Learning curve is rough. You really need to sit down and play several games in a row to really get the hang of the rules, and just when you're getting them and ready to try a real mission, you're out of time for the night. :( Still, could be lots of fun with experienced players.

When I got it I had to play and played the 2 training missions with my wife and it was OK. The next day I played 2 training missions and 3 simulated missions with 3 other players and it was great!! We are making plans to play again this weekend.

After a dozen plays ... this game is nuts (in a fun way).  You really have to work as a team and rely on the other players to do things they say they are. We have died more then we have survived but it was always a blast.

After several plays we have just started throwing new players into the regular missions with the experienced crew. The newbies get a brief rules summary and figure it out after the 1st mission.

This is Pandemic on crack. This is hard. This is stressful. This is somehow still fun, even when your Sitting Duck class ship starts getting shredded to rivets by an angry space octopus. 

Looks like the expansion adds some really thoughtful goodies (player roles, campaign mode, ...and even *harder* baddies? why, god, why?), but the base game seems to have enough in it to keep anyone amused for a while.

Solo mode is like a dexterity game almost, but still worthwhile. I'd suggest splitting the action cards into piles: heroic, left, right, turbolift, A, B, C, and battlebots, otherwise you'll be likely to be playing a minigame of 94-Pick-Up.

What a game. I need to dive more into it to say more. But it is quite unique and a different experience to play as a coop in a small group. It is stressfull, hectic, chaotic, puzzling in a very good way. It is fun to see the result of the short time span you atually DID something as a kind of replay. Big disadvantage is the long time you need to master the rules and concepts to play it more frequently with different people.

While it does have training missions to build you up to it, the "fully unlocked" game has a ton of options and things to keep track of throughout the game. When this is demanded of your players to figure out in real time while the game is making demands of them, it takes a certain type of personality to try be okay with taking that beating while the madness is all around them.

I want to love this game, but I need to find a good group willing to put in the time and take their licks to do it. Of all the games in my collection, this one makes me the saddest as I see it continue to be unplayed.

I really like this game. It is different then other games and does a great job as a co-op game. Because it is so unique, it is not a game you can just pick-up and play with someone; You must teach them the game and only after a few games do you feel like you understand the game and its strategy. I love the difficulty of the game, but is is hard and may not be for every one. I don't mind losing to the game because it is a fun challenge, but I noticed that some of the other players were not having fun constantly losing  =P 
UPDATE this is a very hard game and not for everyone, so I don't get it to the table as much; and this is not a game to play by yourself.

That's what I thought of this piece of crap game.  WHEN I could understand what the CD was saying it was marginally playable. 

The problem is, I could never understand it.

So it gets the lowest rating I give games that are marginally playable....a 2.  You won't ever see me play this again.

Too bad.  It was very promising and I was so looking forward to it...then that CD was turned on and I realized how terrible it was.  Maybe if they had simply used AN ENGLISH SPEAKING NON ROBOTIC SOUND on the recording, it would have gone better...but no...you have to go and do some silly crap roboic gibberish.

A frantically-paced co-operate where you have to co-ordinate movements to defeat enemy warships, hazards and aliens. Unique soundtrack which directs each 10 min. mission. Without some experienced crew you'll be in big trouble, which is usually how our games have gone. Don't play with less than 4. Not a game for unwinding hence my lower score.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
I love this game. This is one of few real time mechanics that I play and I think that it is amazing. The game can be considered as the internal story of what is happening on Galaxy Trucker, I have to say that the cover doesn't help a lot to do the connection, in Space Alert it seems that you are at the Enterprise or something like that, but when you see the board, the weapons and the engines, the theme, everything connects with Galaxy Trucker.
Having said that, the key of the game is the real time system: how well the players are able to organize themselves, how they adapt to following orders, yes, eventually someone will have to take the decisions and you will have to obey (or they will have to follow your commands)... I totally understand that this game is not for every players. A lot of gamers want to analyze the situation, what options do they have and then take the best option. I totally get that because I also like that kind of game, but the excitement of trying to make all those decisions in a limited time, being sure that no one will take the lift at the same time than you are going to use it, to combine the energy reload before using it, or after using it, taking care of the internal threat when the remaining players have already planned their first 6 moves and the alien is going to blow the ship by turn 7... all those things, for me, are amazing. Having said that, yes there are many hard times, the ship is going to blow up many, many times, you are going to feel depressed eventually, but when everything comes into place and there are no big mistakes and you can play 2 or 3 games without losing, the game is amazing.
Positive:
1. The real time mechanic
2. The theme and how thematic everything is
3. Easy to explain
4. Quick to play, the audio tape takes around 10 minutes. Then the resolution phase another 20 or so
5. Real feeling of success when you survive
Negative:
1. It is very difficult. Even without using the yellow cards, do not say anything about the red ones...
2. Every player needs to be focused. It is very easy to make a mistake by playing an movement to the right when you have to move left. Trust me, VERY easy
3. It may be difficult finding a group where all players enjoy the game

Brilliant.  I cannot say much more: innovative, loads of fun, theme and mechanics work great together.  Excellent base for expansions (new threats, malfunctions, trajectories etc)...

RATING: 9
Well well.  Chvátil really sets himself apart once again from pretty much all the other designers in the Industry as far as I can see and IMO. Highly original and innovative once again here with some very nice touches overall and dripping with theme as well. 

Luckily I played this well after the hype machine went out of control so I wasn't so sickened by the hype that it affected my enjoyment, which has happened to me with other titles and I suspect happened to others with this one. You really just have to approach the game with the sole intention of having fun as well although you are also highly challenged to beat the game.  

Like most co-ops group dependancy will dictate how much fun you have, our whole group loved it and we played 6 times in our first night of discovery with this game. That says a lot coming from me anyway and I feel it has a great addictive quality where you want to play again to improve, take on harder challenges or just beat the ones you just lost. The game has a nice tension to it with needing to act "under the gun" and boy can things go to hell in a handbasket in a hurry if your not working together.  

Listening to the instructions I got a little soured when I heard the programmed actions and how you basically plan out all your moves in realtime but dont actually resolve anything until the very end, I figured overall it sounded okay to good but not great. Well it works much better in practice than it seems it would and players really do HAVE to co-operate or you will do very poorly. My brother from the army thinks you could have one guy just be the captain and give out orders all game and things would run smoothly. It might work but it wouldn't be much of a game then and that was NOT the way it was designed to play, doing that would ruin all the fun completely. Also the CD which I thought was largely gimmicky before playing actually works along perfectly in the background keeping you on your toes so not gimmicky since its integral to keep the timing of events during play.   

Where the game shines is players must decide together who is going to go where on the ship and who is going to do what (and due to the cards people have which only they know not everyone can do everything) all as fast as possible since time is always against you and an ever present factor. Being in the right place at the right time and communication are the key key factors and it is not easy to keep it going since you are trying to figure out on your own the best way to contain a threat, play the order of your own cards, refuel a generator etc. Also, it can be hard to coordinate just the conversation since I need something done but then so does player 2, and player 3, help I need help over here, no sorry I'm busy, hey give me that card next turn, alright kill that bastard already! etc - some examples of everyone barking out demands all at the same time in a frenzy.  

There is some chaos effects here that can mess up your plans (and that is largely "exactly" where the fun is during the resolving phase) but here is the thing, the really great part is, they only happen when you or someone screws up! This really had us in stitches when someone was firing lasers into empty space, someone played their card wrong, someone trys to regenerate the shield but has no power, etc. What ends up happening too is some domino effects happen that affect the other players so then you just have to laugh when things get really goofed up. Great laughter came from this actually since everyone knows the moment you realized you goofed how bad the implications might be, then some ridiculing might start, it was just plain silly fun when things got all fubar'ed and made some great gaming moments for us, I was in tears.   

Check out what my buddy Cortexbomb had to say, QUOTE "For some reason I want to liken it to a cocktail party from hell: 4 people are trying to talk to you at once while an out of control DJ is barking out nonsense through his microphone, which is annoying everyone in the room. Meanwhile the exterior of the building is being ravaged by wild animals which the guests are occasionally taking potshots at with their assault rifles." END - LOL nice one! This is mostly a pretty good description and why we all enjoyed the game and why he did not. So looking at that you can hopefully tell whether it is a game for you or not because where some people love it is exactly where lots of others wont.  

Replay was our only slight concern and maybe why I dont have a 9 rating like I think it deserves (though it will get it if I hit 15 plays + and still want to play) as its hard to really knock the game for anything else. I also wonder if it will stay as fun and enjoyable once the freshness wears off(common and this was part of our replay concern). I do think it will benefit from an expansion with maybe some different kind of threats and maybe a new "deck" in the form of another board, just some other new things to do as well as new missions. I think as long as you play it occasionally only, it will have some legs.  

We played with 4 players which I think is probably the minimum and was a great number, 3 won't be as fun since coordinating will be easier but might be passable, 5 should be pretty good. Games only take maybe 20 minutes to play in total. I think this will make a GREAT GATEWAY game and might be my go-to gateway of choice(along with RA), will be tested very soon.

This is my favourite co-op game to date and I think I have played maybe 7 or 8 different ones so far which mostly all were pretty good. Oh and on that note this blows the doors off Pandemic, no contest due to sheer fun level. 

[u]UPDATE[/u] Played with 3 + 2 androids and thought it was fun, also played with 2 players + 3 Androids (not in rules) and its still a fun challenging game. 4 or 5 actual players is better of course but if I knew I was only ever going to have 3 players, I'd probably still buy this. *-).  You are missing the "true" chaos with more real players and the fun of 3 people trying to talk to you all at the same time but the lower numbers are still interesting, at least for now. The time pressure might even make the solo flight worth trying for those interested (I never play solo games but hell I might even try it since its so short)

Ratings would be something like this:

(4:9, 5:9, 3:8, 2:7, 1:6.5)

Rating after 8 plays.  The always inventive Vlaada Chvatil has produced yet another unique game here.  This time he takes on the cooperative game, and the results aren't really like anything else in my collection.  If you took Robo Rally and combined it with something like Shadows Over Camelot, you're getting close.  It combines the chaos of pre-planning turns with continuous fire fighting, along with the continual ballet of trying to coordinate your actions with the other players (especially power management).  When you add in the chaos of threats coming in at unpredictable times, and the variability of the tracks, it's a fascinating game and one that is fantastically quick.

With the right group, a lot of freaking chaotic fun!  Each game is only a few minutes long.  Takes a while to go through all the rules.  Then all chaos breaks out.  Coop game in which players are crewing a hapless ship, trying to defend it against aliens.  In real time, need to coordinate complex series of actions to fire weapons, generate energy, put up shields, move around ship, etc. etc. through placement of cards on timeline but can't show each other the cards and only limited time to do it while CD with sound track keeps throwing up additional complications.  Hilarious when plans go astray through a misplaced card or miscommunication.  Must have a group that gets into the right spirit though.  Then lots of laughs!

After our initial session where we busted through several training missions and one real mission this game is clearly some unique fun.  Even the rules are fun to read.  They are well organized, and do a great job introducing the game slowly to you.  I would highly recommend going through the training sequence with any new player. Interestingly it is a relatively complex game that is quick to set up and quick to play.  A solid 9 now, could increase if future plays are as fun as first.

A thrilling game, that will rack your nerves and push your coop abilities to the limit!

***UPDATE***
There is one major problem with this game. Since it is a real-time game, a perfect memory of all the cards and stuff is needed to become better. Since we play lots of other games (and don't even play boardgames as much as we could), I have a feeling we will get stuck with playing the basic cards forever, since each new game we play feels like learning the game again...

I've played a number of the training missions - and they've all been a lot of fun.  I think they'll come a point where the game feels more or less solved or I can't be bothered to argue about who should push the A button - but with the variety of threats and the threat time lines they should be a lot of replayability before then.

Theme: SciFi comedy
Gameplay: Programmed movement Co-op with CD based 10 minute audio countdowns and randomized threats making stressful chaos.
Components: Good
Replayability: Unfortunately not a very approachable game despite being kind of amazing, it got traded when I came to terms with the fact that it just wasn't going to be played. 
Rulebook: Good.

Real time vlaada game. First half of the game you're struggling to keep track of the aliens coming in and where you want to be and how you want to stop them. The second half of the game you sit there and take it by replaying the events you chose earlier. If the space station survives you win.

Space Alert is hands-down the best game I have ever played. As a co-op game, it effectively solves all of the problems other co-op games have by adding a time limit—no one person runs the show, and you're free to share all of your information.

The game's rules are very solid, unambiguous, and straightforward. You know what you have to do and how to do it, and your group has to figure out how to do it in 10 minutes. With resolution, a game takes 20 minutes, and not a moment of those 20 minutes feels stale.

Initial Rating: 8.0 (March 2011)

OUTSTANDING game, I can’t believe how many good games Vlaada has designed (Through the Ages, Dungeon Lords, Galaxy Trucker and soon to play Prophecy), he is one of my top 3 favorite designers. I really love Space Alert, the gameplay, the theme, the high interaction between players, the components, everything. It has a huge replayability and it is very simple to learn (after 1 play everything is understood). The play time is short but it packs a lot of fun. I recommend it to everyone. As of today 2011-07-26 I have not played with the highest difficulty due that we always play with new players. 

This game is a keeper; I always want to play it.

Space Alert continues to be a top game for me. Perhaps it is my favorite CoOp game EVER. Vlaada is a genius and solved the alpha player issue making sure all the players played at the same time. It is very fun even if the ship got destroyed (by the way, I played Prophecy and it wasn´t the masterwork I was expecting :S).

Space Alert was the first game I ever played with an audio soundtrack, making it very novel for me. The rules are a delight to read, great theme (one of my favorites). Nowadays I feel the game is not so easy to teach. As I wrote years ago, all is understood after one play, but in that play everything will go wrong as there are lots of rules to explain. 

The gameplay is a delight and it is very short (around 12 minutes), there is a lot of chaos and screaming, pure fun. Then you have to see how well you fared (around 10 more minutes).

Best with 5 players. With 4 players it is ok, with less it isn’t fun, although there is another ship designed for three players. I haven’t played with it yet.

I’m kind of sad Space Alert doesn’t hit the table more often. You need a committed group to properly enjoy it, otherwise there will be always new players that need to be taught the game AND you can’t use the higher difficulty enemies for the game.

Next year I will make the commitment to find a game group to play Space Alert.

I love Space Alert, however it is a game I don’t really like to explain. I still haven’t found a committed group to play the game and the expansion. It also isn’t universal liked, many friends dislike it and it is a hassle to explain everything each time we play. Due to this I’m downgrading its rating.

Still I love the game and I feel that won’t change.

One of 2008´s favorites.

Oh god what to say about this great game! The confusion the chaos the funny moments where your shooting but theirs no power cause you thought he thought..... This game is by far one of the best coop games out there. The only down side is that its a hard concept to grasp for some. But that being said its not that complicated. I would say the first too games will be rough with a new player after that your in for some great moments!

Very innovative co-op design with the audio track making for unpredictable missions. That players are not allowed to show their cards to each other prevents (to an extent) one player trying to dictate play as can often be the case in co-op games.

Perhaps slightly better in concept than play. It  became chaotic in the planning phase as the louder players start shouting more than listening, and also in the execution phase as players' plans fall apart - or maybe that's the intention!

Real-time racing to protect the ship from attack by timing your moves against the sound file played on computer or iOS device. The real challenge isn't the game, though there is still some strategy as to recharge and station positioning: the real challenge is being able to communicate effectively with other players before impact.

BIG PLUS: involvement, intensity
PLUS: strategy, game play
BIG MINUS: intensity coupled with poor communication makes this game lost no matter how well some players work

Nobody seems to follow the 'communication systems down' rule in this game. It's all hectic yelling, very different sort of game. Usually we either win by a landslide or are utterly destroyed within a few rounds when someone messes up. A little difficult to teach to new players because of the time limit. So the game is not without its faults, but its still a heck of a lot of fun.

Okay co-op game played in real time. I think handled properly the puzzles can be worked out pretty well. On the other hand if you have a group of people like we did that just kind of simultaneously programmed and on top of that programmed the wrong action then you'll probably never successfully complete a mission.

This games is a whole new experience in board games. I was really looking forward to trying it since I read about it before being released, and now I can say it doesn't disappoint at all! It is extremely polished and well thought, and the difficulty is incredibly customizable. 

Still I must say in my group we had a lot of initial trouble grasping the general concept of how the game works, and though now I would say it is easy to learn all the rules once you get past the general concept, it can also be very HARD to actually win a game. In any case I feel this is half of its charm, it's a game where you have fun and laughter even if you lose... and sometimes, specially if you loose! Definitely recommended if you like cooperative games, and/or a sci-fi game that creates a very nice atmosphere.

This wonderful cooperative game is not for anyone or any group. It needs dedicated people, willing to think tactically and work together on the solutions for the ever incoming problems. Also the realtime timer might raise the tension in the game - and discourage some "thinkers".

But if you like furious action, a lot of shouting around and "playing by your guts" rather than thinking about a move for 5 minutes, go for it!

[b]Update:[/b] I've held off on rating this a 10 for about a year. I've realized that the only thing holding me back was the need to constantly ease in new players with simulations and not full missions. This is one of my favorite games though, and I just love playing full missions with people who know what they're doing. It's so good at what it does, such a humorous, varied, and tight design. 

[b]Tracking My Impressions[/b]: On the second play (first basic game with a grasp of the rules), I had a persistent feeling that I was playing one of the greatest games anyone has ever come up with. Slick, innovative, what's not to like? Still getting a feel for it. Initial rating is a strong "8." 

Update: 3 more plays in one evening. Yep, this is really, really fun. Perhaps more sensitive to group camaraderie than Pandemic, but extremely well done and addictive. 

Update: 3 more plays. Nothing but greatness. A phenomenal game. I think this is just right for four players. It's not quite as much fun when you have to spend some time looking out for the android in a three-player game, and with five the chaos ratchets up perhaps too much. 

[b]Why Space Alert is Awesome[/b]: For 10 minutes, player listen to an audio track that tells them what sorts of threats are endangering the ship (enemy boarding party, malfunctioning equipment, asteroids, space pirates, the occasional intersellar octopus, and more). During that time, everyone tries to coordinate their actions so that when the game is resolved, everyone is in the right place at the right time, adjusting shields, reloading ammunition, firing lasers and rockets, sending out interceptors, activating battlebots, etc. Because of the real-time constraint, you can only discuss the situation so much before your action choices are locked in. When the audio track is over, you go back through each turn (or "minute") of play, and see how well you did based on your programmed actions. The ship might survive, or you may be blown to bits. It all depends on how well you communicated in the heat of the moment. A light-hearted, engaging, fast, well-produced, and extremely well designed game. Highly recommended. 

Update: You really need the right players for this, but if you have them, it's just an incomparable game experience. I'm not sure why I haven't rated this a 10 yet. A few more campaigns are in order. 

Update: I downgraded my rating from a 10 to a 9 only because I never get to play it and even if I did, the play-quality would be greatly lowered by inexperienced crew-mates.

RATING: 7
As a co-op game, SPACE ALERT is one of the best in conceptual execution.  The addition of a CD to simulate a master computer issuing commands & reporting threats is very innovative--way cool!  The CD also doubles as a timing device (instead of a ticking timer/hourglass device) which limits the players to 10 minutes to decide what their actions will be within the scenerio they are playing.  It is like a combo of PANDEMIC & RED NOVEMBER on steroids.  BUT!  The way a player can be lost in the decision of placing action cards during the shuffle of game-play by other players bothers me.  One can easily find themselves becoming a spectator to an interesting board game while watching the scenerio unfold.  Nevertheless, I am impressed by the game's design in so many ways.

It's almost impossible to play advanced missions with newbies. With each new player you have to start from scratch again. The high stress factor can turn casual gamers off this game. Contrary to voiced opinions, I really dislike the rules of Czech Board Games. They are bloated and could be half the size without any loss of content. Beside that, it was great fun to play although I must be in the mood for a constantly changing game. This game might move up to an 8/10 if advanced missions prove to be repeatedly satisfying.

Yes! This game is amazing. I can't imagine a better game of this type. I have not complaints. Every element of the game is so amazing. The threat cards are varied and interesting and customizable. The damage tokens are one of my favorite parts, as they sit on top of the board and represent that your ship loses functions as it takes damage. Everything else in the game is just so great, too. It really rewards repeated plays. Also, the app is great!

The rule book is pretty good, but it isn't something that you can just jump in to. In the helpful handbook, there is a lot of funny, but there is unnecessary flavor text. And while it is fun to read, makes the game very slow to get started.

The game starts off a bit fiddly when you start playing for the first time. The board could be a little bit clearer in describing what does what, especially when it comes to power distribution.

My rating is sure to change, as I don't yet have much experience with the game.  I'm not too big of a fan of cooperative games, and programming is not my strong suit.  But I have to give the game credit for originality and use of audio components.  Space Dealer has the CD purely for mood, Squad Seven is the only other game I know of that has an audio soundtrack as an integral part of the game.  Also, the rules are some of the funniest I've read, a great job.

Despite the hype, this space co-op game disappointed 2 separate gaming groups of mine. The 10 minute space-romp is quite good, but the resolution phase (which is a step-by-step replay of the frantic 10 minutes but takes another 20 minutes) is boring, fiddly and the anti-climatic way to end the game.

Also, I find the game a tedious exercise in trying to get everyone to time their steps in perfect harmony. And if even 1 person gets it wrong, he has basically ruined the game for everyone. There is no way to recover or change anything, and makes for a terribly boring resolution phase, because all you can do is WATCH but not PLAY. The unforgiving nature of the game means that a simple mistake at the start means that the whole game is lost.

Rules are also quite heavy and because of the tutorial nature of the rules (4 different ways to play the game) made the game extremely hard to learn --- it sounds like an oxymoron, but I prefer to learn the complete game one-shot instead of in separate parts.

The best way I've come up with to describe this game is its a combination of Escape the Cursed Temple, Red November, and Robo Rally. Three phenomenal games in their own right. This game is an investment in time. You really have to go through all the training missions, but don't worry, they're tons of fun. You need to have a group who can play this a lot to REALLY get to the amazing stuff though. Its definitely tons of fun right off the bat, but holy crap once you get people who really know how to play. THAT is when the game becomes something very special.

Love it, love it, love it. Will it last? I'm not sure. With improved logistics between players perhaps this becomes a procession and no longer, a chaotic fun mess. Want a solution? Teach it to more new players, develop new working relationships. There is replayability to the game in that each game has different events in different orders and each player may have a different strength in cards held. Once set up, the game plays fantastically quickly. I can't believe I passed this up at Essen '08, the old guys who panned it at the time have taught me that gaming experience means so very little.

This seems like a perfect game to play in a leadership workshop type of seminar.  I think to win at this game, you need a delegating leader who assign specific jobs to people, but let each person decide how to handle each job.

It is also like Galaxy trucker in that it is probably more fun when you make a mistake and everything falls apart.

I think it is interesting, but not really my type of game.

It's always a huge mess and seeing the panic is part of the fun. Winning is highly rated!

Manic, real-time space co-op where you and your fellow crew members race to determine how to deal with incoming enemies by simultaneously programming your movements around the ship to ensure energy boosts, maintain shield power, and formulate an attack strategy all while the ship's computer keeps spouting out warnings and instructions designed to raise your blood pressure.

Whew!

I didn't enjoy this much the first few plays.  Invariably someone would put the wrong order down and the whole ship would go up in flames.  As we learned the game we started to work together more effectively and actually got through a few scenarios with success.  This game is nice because even in loss there is plenty of opportunity to have fun and laugh.  Especially when someone goes to press on a button and nothing happens.

Part game, part activity. The game is deterministic once all incoming threats are known, and only practical hindrances stop you from optimizing your response. The bits are very nice, and it's delightfully nonsensical that whichever random point in the universe you pop into, there'll be an "interstellar octopus" bearing down on that precise spot, but I'm afraid this ultimately isn't my type of game.

A fun game. Felt a bit chaotic at first, but when the dust settled after a few games, everything became much more clearer. Has many of the strengths/weaknesses of the "Galaxy Trucker", but isn't so ostentatiously funny. The objective of the game is, and stays clearer, much better through out the whole game, because of the short game length. Good co-op, that can be used as a quick filler too. Although I must say that "The Gimmick of the Year" prize goes to the CD provided with the game... :D

RATING: 10
Excellent game - I especially like that it is skill based. If you fail in lot of co-op games, you can feel that everything was stacked against you and you maybe even did not have much chance and there was quite a lot of luck involved in your failure. However I do not feel same with Space Alert, I feel that it was my or our failure that we have not communicated better, that we have not properly tracked dangers, etc. I really believe that this game would make for quite good crisis management training session. You need quick and proper decisions. You need someone who takes charge of things and all members of crew need to take their responsibility... Once again - excellent, engaging game.

Great fun. The rules are written in that now typical humorous style that Vlaada games are getting known for. The game itself flows reasonably well after you have stumbled a little through the first play and quickly becomes less about the rules and more about the theme. This is another case of the whole being better than the sum of its parts. 

Its difficult at first but you get better as you gain a little experience. Considering i am not the greatest fan of co op games, this is in my current hot 10, and in danger of becoming a group favourite.

This game requires the most communication skills out of all of the games I own.  It's terrifically hectic and you feel like you're really scrambling to hold the ship together.  I like it a lot more than I like Galaxy Trucker; of course, they're separate games, but something about this one really clicks with me.
--UPDATE--
If I could increase my score past 10 I would.  I played the game some more, and gosh darn it if it didn't get better than my first impression.  A true gem.

A solid game -- lots of fun! After 4 plays (+2 tutorial missions), I've yet to get the ship blown up.

This strikes the perfect balance between chaos and strategy for a realtime cooperative game. I see getting a lot of play from this.

Update: After 38 plays, I've blown up quite a bit. Still a great game.

11/26/12:  Can't seem to get this BACK to the table!  I think some of my group has PTSD from this game and is avoiding it because it is too stressful.

Based on two plays; five-player games.  Chaotic with everyone going all over the place.  Many actions wasted because you have to program actions in advance and you may not be able to do that action "when you get there".  I don't see this being very entertaining even if I became more familiar with it.  I'd play it again if everyone else wanted to (it's pretty short) but don't care to play it again otherwise.

Space Alert is a good cooperative game, and for me to say that is really saying something. It overcomes the problems of other cooperative games by not giving you enough time to solve it as a puzzle. The problem with this is, it has so many fiddly rules, and yet it plays so quickly... I never found it to be a sound time investment to learn it. I can't justify spending several hours learning a game that will be over in fifteen minutes. Sorry, Vlaada, but this is one of your games that I won't be keeping on my shelf.

I love this game! The best cooperative game that I have ever played hands down. This game when played correctly solves all of the issues of group think and tasks players with damage control and talking amongst one another. Many times players will band together to form smaller units that will take on looming events or upcoming issues. The other events that take place along the soundtrack add unique features to the game. Also, this game does not suffer from AP as players are tasked with making decisive actions as player's feel the urgency of the real time events taking place. I don't have a bad thing to say about this game at all. I absolutely love it. Non-gamers will think this has a steep learning curve, and will be right. Gamers will understand the basic game mechanics, but may need to play several times to get the feel for the pacing of the game. This is on my short list to purchase.

Great cooperative game! Many innovating ideas, great tension and fun. It balances cooperative play with individual decisions witch mechanism of hidden orders. There is no chance to have one person making decisions for everyone.

Currently I'm a little afraid of repeatability. Plays seems to be quite similar but I'll judge this after more sessions. There is no problem in limited number of sound tracks. In my opinion the only problem could be in first-several-round-templates.

Unfortunately, the game is a little to complex to be ideal introductory game for non-gamers such as e.g. Mall of Horror.

RATING: 3
I find myself solidly on the wrong side of popular opinion on this one. While there is some entertainment value to the real time aspect, planning seems important but can be dashed completely by a single misplayed card by almost any crewmember. Damage and effects arising from damage further the spiral of chaos until it just denigrates into a ridiculous crew-bash. I don't mind randomness at all, but with the crew locked into a slavish routine dictated by pre-selected cards, it feels more like your ship is run by AI-challenged robots than thinking, living human beings.

RATING: 7
Fast paced and chaotic.  It becomes difficult to coordinate with other players.  I guess that's really the heart of the game- trying to communicate and coordinate moves with other players while under a time constraint.  We played on Easy mode and, while easy to beat, it was a bit maddening.  I don't think I can even imagine what a Hard scenario would be like.  When I do try to imagine, I see a lot of explosions.

Won the award for innovative here.

really I don't see anything innovative here. It uses a cd. Squad 7 uses one. I've got an old boardgame that uses a K-7 that keeps running and when the K-7 ends you have to solve the murder or you loose. I can think of several games that use a DVD
It's cooperative. well nothing new. 
Game has different phases... so what.

I have no problem admitting that the game combines the phases well but to call it innovative... 




I like it but resolution face can make or break the game. 
If you start making fun with some moves and add some noises yourselves it is a 9. If everybody remains quiet it is a 7.

comment I made after three plays (Training mission 1,1 and 2)

We played with four ,I was communication officer and Gust who was sitting on my left was captain. So I was playing the fourth cadet as well.Our first mission was terrible. we didn't destroy the first threat. We were doing some uncoordinated stuff ( people didn't consider the effect of the actions of people before them). Pretty funny I have to add. But all in all we came close to making it (7 damage points)

The replay of the first test mission was a piece of cake.
We didn't power the shields anymore at the first time of asking  (they deplete the power needed to fire the lasers too). and had one team (loader and attacker) fighting one threat, while a second team was fighting another threat. the loader could prepare for the third threat.

Hope that all makes sense. Once you've played it it probably does.

We also played the second test mission. No problem at all. With 2 people on the upper decks and two people assisting on the lower deck.

Data exchange was a big laugh the first couple of times.. People wanted to trade cards well after those phases ended. Much too slow :shake:. This was much improved by a simple agreement. We had to agree on exchanges before the actual dataexchange phase. (do you have an Action card you don't need?)

The strange thing is while planning we didn't move our man at all.This is possible because 7 actions aren't to many and you can quickly see where your man is when you look at your planning.

We didn't calculate score. The others wanted to continue playing this one and kept asking what action c was. Because I just had prepared until the first training mission I didn't know the answer and I was a bit worried about the time it would take to figure this out and explaining  it to everyone.

I also read something in calculating the score that possibly meant we played something wrong (players knocked out of the game)I think this comes later into play.

The only slight concern I still have is the resolution phase.
I think this will go away after a couple of more plays. I think it is possible that players don't feel attached anymore because they allready did everything. However this was not the case and the resolution phase with the excellent elevator and shield noises of Tom was great.

What about the "One leader who takes control" problem?
.
Because cards are not shown and the actual playing time is so short I see no real problem with players of the same skill
The captain is not the person who tells everybody what to do. Every player his action has consequences for the next players. Maybe on a higher difficulty the captain will have more options than other players (i don't know), Now the cadets agreed pretty quick on everything.

However the cooperative play with added complexity if you go through the missions is the reason why I can't rate it 8+

People have to be on a same skill level (or understand the options they have available and the consequences for scoring)if you don't want the one leader who takes control problem and to get the most out of the game.

People have to have the same skill in  games to enjoy fully is especially true in cooperative games.  

In the training missions we played everybody was equal. Suppose I knew this game inside out I would start telling people what the optimal actions were instead of suggesting what I feel are the best actions. This I wouldn't do on the easy training missions we played but I probably would do if we raced through the explanation of the game to play one of the more difficult missions.

About the cd.
Much has been talked about the cd and the voice. It does the job. Nothing more nothing less. The cd and sound noises make this pretty stressfull in a good way. Playing with the cd also has the advantage that the time keeper (communications officer) can take the role of one of the cadets. 

All of us want to play this one again.

I hate cooperative games. I HATE THEM. They usually boil down to one outspoken personality dictating to everyone else what they should do. This results in people either grumbling and hating that person or standing up to them and fighting breaks out. Not a fun way to spend an evening. But this takes all my expectations as the latest cooperative craze and disposes of them. My group played 6 games in a row the first time out. That's insane considering we barely play our favorite games more than once a game-night. The difference is the limited time to work out your differences and with the roborally style card play once you make a choice, that's the way it will play out. So people have the freedom to disagree with the dominant player and the dominant player will soon see that working together and letting everyone have their say is the only way to win the game. The other difference is that just because a person has a 'best move to make' doesn't mean their cards will allow them to follow that through. So changes to the best of plans need to be made in order to accomodate the realism of what was dealt. Random factors do abound but it's not about the randomization as much as it's about the puzzle of figuring out how to react to them well. A great theme and a training structure that brings players in gradually leave this as my (begrudgingly) surprise find of the past two years.

The limitations of real-time interaction and special circumstances really help with some of the possible slowdown and group-play of cooperative games; it's too hard to manage everyone else in the time allotted.  Unfortunately, the frantic pace isn't for everyone and can require too much concentration at times.  If I played more often, I might want more threat cards and scenarios for the encounter variety, but the gameplay certainly varies a lot because of other variability (e.g., scenario, threat order, threat vector).  It's too bad to have to teach new people to play with the starter mission simulations, but the games are still pretty fun, even if incomplete.

It's a relatively simple co-operative puzzle game that only works because of the time pressure. I dislike time pressure in games, however, and the combination of time-pressure and co-operative evolves to easily in following orders from the most assertive player.
I guess the game may be very enjoyable for the right type of gamer. I'm just not that kind of gamer.

Great game with a dash of madness, a healthy lug of chaos and an occasional tear. The mechanics are quite simple, yet the combination of player co-operation and limited time makes the game really challenging. 

Best played with 4-5 players.
Takes about 20-30 min per mission.
Fast reaction time combined with team skills needed.

RATING: 7.5
The best coop game in my collection.  Never becomes a 1-man game, everyone must participate, super quick play (30 mins / game), light but ok depth, nicely tweakable difficulty and seriously fun play.  This game is a riot.  I was really skeptic at first and thought it looked gimmicky (with the CD and all).  Wouldn't have bought it if it hadn't been from Vlaada, but boy was I wrong.  Theme is very geeky, which can be hard on some crowds but otherwise an extremely well designed and executed game.  I was sincerly impressed...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Amazing game. For me it wouldn't be fair to say that it lays on the segment of collaborative games: in fact, it redefines this segment. It doesn't have all the typical problems of the collaborative games (the alpha player, despite possible, is often uncounsciously avoided, and if someone assume this role it is only to give general indications, which doesn't kill the fun for the other players). 

In addition, the feeling of "being a team, working all together" is more intense in this game than in any other I have never played. So it is the tension. And the feeling of relieve that invades you after the end of a mission. 

This last statement is specialy true. In fact, I have yet to find a more demanding game than SA: you need to plan your movements taking into account the different threats appearing in real time and forcing you to reconsider your previous actions. And you have to do that in tight coordination with your team mates. Oh! and you have to do that in phases lasting less than 4 minutes. It is not easy, so be prepared: you will lose a lot. And you know what? It will be surprisingly fun.

My favourite game overall. Strongly recommendable.

Very nicely produced cooperative game that involves a bit of roborally type programming in which everyone has to be aware of what everyone else is doing in order to be successful.  I found it enjoyable and flavorable although I'm uncertain if it is worth the price of admission.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
This is in many ways a very interesting and innovative game. For one, it excellently manages to be a truly co-operative game. Together with the CD as a time limit and tempo setting device/mechanic, it also makes for a rather stressful experience, which is typical for real-time strategy games (which I am not the biggest fan of - that's also the reason why I do not give the game a higher rating).

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Probably the most fun cooperative that I have played so far. The programing and the stress of getting your actions programmed make it so that this one doesn't suffer too much from "That guy telling everyone what to do." It's a laugh riot when someone, or everyone, has their timing off by a couple of rounds. This one truly requires that the team work as one to overcome the obstacles you face. It is also nice that the game can be adjusted to different difficulties.

RATING: 7
I have only played the two test run scenarios so far.  I will update this rating when I play the full game.  Very interesting, unique design that uses time pressure well (much better than Space Dealer for instance).  I often find cooperative games to be very deterministic in play after a few games -- hopefully this game will break that  trend.

7.8: Rating after one fun play of the test flight with the 'right' group, who loved the theme as well. Hope to play/practice more often, so 'some day I will go on a real mission'. While we were blasted out of the sky we had a blast. ;-)

It's co-op and it has a SciFi theme. Definitely my kind of game, even though the Roborally aspect didn’t appeal to me beforehand, it didn’t bother me at all during the game. (Whereas, I’m really bad at planning my way around in Roborally, and yes like the female stereotype goes: I also rotate a map/city plan when finding the right direction... ;-p)

PROVISIONAL RATING BASED ON PLAYING THE SIMULATIONS WITH 5 PLAYERS

Highly considered design, clear user-friendly layout, great theme (supported by an atmospheric cd . . . which is a fancy sand timer) smooth learning curve and every advancement through training makes me want to play the next stage straight away.

Co-op games sometimes fail because one voice may dominate but the various sections - requiring to break off into smaller teams -  and short decision time mean that it is unlikely. Within the game there is a captain role for one player which would seem to contradict my viewpoint but I (and our group of players) see the role merely as a fancy first player marker.   

Furthermore, in some co-op games a player may be reduced to a minor role but again quick playtime and added complexity (as scenarios evolve demands on each player should increase) suggests that the likelihood is reduced . . . anyway if it does happen you will only be subjected to it for a short time.

Ultimately, Space Alert was the platform for a great night and what more can you ask than that.  It is now my co-op game of choice.

Maybe it was the person who taught us, but the game just didn't seem that exciting, more fiddly than anything. Plus it was hard to make out what the computer was saying. I can see this as potentially being fun as a solitaire game - sort of a neat puzzle - but if I want to play something with real time elements, Galaxy Trucker certainly fits the bill far better than this.

This game is just plain fun, and I think it's furthered by the fact that there are training missions that baby step you up to the full game; without which it could be a VERY frustrating experience.

Yes it's chaotic; if you're not a fan of programmed movement a-la Robo Rally stay away, or of coop games this is definitely not for you. But we played 4 times in a row and did all of the training and found we wanted to play more and more, regardless of the increasing obstacles.

There's a vast variety of things you can do, and thankfully you can freely converse and plan, and on occasion trade cards.

This one is oozing with theme, magnificent bits, and plenty of fun.

I would certainly say that this one deserves 4-5 players for best effect.

A lot of rules and mechanics to teach for 10 minutes of stress (although it is quite intuitive). It requires multiple plays to have a clue what is going on, and nobody in my friend group has ever requested it after the first time, simply because it is way too taxing for a work night.

This game is brilliant in a number of games. It's got  a lot of moving parts, but the "training missions" on the CD make learning the rules about 1,000x times as fun as just reading a rulebook. The "training manual" is a complete hoot. And the business of trying to decide on the correct actions under time constraints is a total blast. 

The CD mission soundtracks themselves are a bit of a missed opportunity - lots more could have been put on them to ad to drama and flavor than just the minimal sound effects and basic 'computer' commands that one actually hears. And success at each mission depends too much on luck of the draw, and can ultimately be a pretty depressing affair, since the only way to win is not to die.

Still, overall this one is a winner and an example of a rare phenomenon indeed - the Euro-style party game.

I don't care for the CD. The sound effects and the voices are a little too hokey for my taste. Otherwise the interaction with the other players during planning is good fun.

Seems a tad similar to Pandemic in its cooperative play mechanism and collective avoiding damage posed by various threats.

The game is helped by a relatively quick gameplay (10 minutes for each episode). The theme feels very Star Trek like.

It is VERY important to note that although the game says 2-5 players, it should be played with a MINIMUM of 4. Otherwise, gameplay is MUCH less enjoyable (based on the reviews).

Gets plenty of great ratings and lots of love.

Can be a little chaotic.

RATING: 8
8/2011 In the right group it's an excellent cooperative game.  But is it a game?  It's not a game involving planning; it's a planning game, followed by step-by-step sequence-of-events de-breefing wrap-up.  The in-between game element is missing; is's like a one-shot RoboRally of 12 movement+action cards.  Only the planning phase (which really is the entire game) is really tense: time preassure with new information appearing and changing conditions, occuring threats and malfunctions has to be handled.  I like it a lot; re-playability virtually unlimited.  A huge varied treasure cramed into a tiny box and only 30 minutes!

A VERY different game! It's cooperative, it's real-time, it's chaotic yet not at all random, it's mostly open-information, requires a lot of careful thinking but not overly heavy. And a game takes only 10 minutes! I've not played much yet, but really quite interesting so far. I hope getting to the full rules doesn't turn it into Robo Rally where your plans constantly turn into nonsense for reasons beyond your control.

I respect the effort and the originality, but I think the result is way of the mark.
A cooperative roborally is a good idea, but when the designer has one billion ideas, and want them all to be present at the same time in the same game, it becomes almost unplayable.
My group has played lots of heavy (ie. Martin Wallace and the other Vlaada Chvatil) games, but with SA, we hit the roof.

The only way I can see this game being playable (and winable) is if one skilled player takes the lead and basically tells everybody else what to do, and then its not cooperative anymore, but solo-with-assists.

Sorry.

Outstanding fun, the most I've ever had playing a coop game. Nice space theme, very cooperative, very interactive, unlike so may coop games that are multi-player solitaires. It's very short, making this so much better you can just throw a quickie to open a gaming session, to close it, or play multiple game over and over.

Lot of variables to enhance replay value: soundtracks, trajectories, enemies, action cards...

If you want a cooperative game with a duration of 20 minutes packed with drama and extreme tension, look no furter ! this is it.
Time managment, coordination and prediction are crucial.
VERY original game. We will going down together.. or survive.

+ Great difference with other co-op games is that there is no real dominant player who will dictate what the other players have to do. Much better than 'shadows over Camelot'
There is a constant tension between coordination, fear, doom and chaos. You are always short of time. 
Very good theme. As a child I was a fan of Star Trek. You want to get the role of Kirk or Spock ?
Shooting at aliens and intruders is a blast !
Short playtime is great. You can easily play this game 3 times in one evening.
This game is best with 4 players, but works also very good with 2 or 3 space adventurers. Optimal control of androïd(s) is a real superimposing challenge.
If you want a funny rule book this one would get the n° 1 prize for most hilarious book. The rules  ar full of suprises and funny notes... 
- 
Despite the funny theme, the rules are not easy. Significant learning curve. For me this is not a bad thing because it's a very rewarding game when you just managed to kill the last enemy before you are flying into deep space...

You need always the same core group. 
Not good playable with occasional groups or with players  who take themselves too serious. This is not a eurogame.

update jan 2013. Still remains the best coop game of all time. I consider myself now an old grown up astronaut, ... but still after more than 50 missions, the game doesn't loose its appeal.

The manuals are excellent and have a great way of introducing all the rules slowly so you have a chance to get a feel for some of it before more is piled on.  Replayability seems quite high.  So far I've only done 5 player games.

Takes lots of practice and/or a really well coordinated group to win. (At the very least it requires a game plan and sticking to it!) Fun game that compares to nothing else out there.  Real-time co-op means less opportunity for an alpha player to take control.  Stressful and loads of fun.

What amazes me most about the games of Vlaada Chvátil is not just how he comes up with so many wild and unusual ideas for games, but the consistent genius with which he implements them. Getting rid of the achilles heel of co-op games - namely the loudest-guy-in-the-room-syndrome, where one pushy person essentially plays a solitaire game, and you’re just dragged along - by putting your planning on a clock is brilliant enough by itself. But even given that initial insight, I doubt that many people could have come up with a game as good as Space Alert is. Demanding, very replayable and hysterically funny, this game has only a single drawback: unless you continually play with the same group, you’ll probably have to go through the introductory scenarios a bit more often than you’d really like to.

Cooperative RoboRally in space!  This game is fun and quick.  Because of the time limit (10 minutes) and real-time play, it really forces you to trust your teammates as you try to survive alien attacks.  Sometimes the end result is just plain disastrous, but at others it can be nail-biting!  Either way it's always a fun time.

Space Alert is crazy, tense in a way that's different than any other game I own, fantastically well-produced, and an absolute blast to play. We played the first test run, second test run, and first simulation in one sitting, and I would happily have played more.

That all of the tension and programming and nuttiness is packed into about 20 minutes -- and is easy to teach -- is pretty amazing. It's a unique game with tons of flavor (the rulebook is worth reading for the comedy alone, but it's also an excellent rulebook in its own right), and despite the fact that it doesn't take itself seriously it's an excellent and well thought-out game.

I had expectations based on what I'd read about SA, and based on playing (and loving) Galaxy Trucker, and it lived up to every one of them. What an amazing game!

In my opinion this is the best cooperative game I ever played. And it is fast. Due to the time constraint, nobody can dominate the game, while player interaction and cooperation is extremely crucial to achieve anything. You could view it as some kind of assessment center, but with a huge amount of fun poured into it.

With Space Alert I got a lot of people into playing board games that never thought board gaming would be for them.

RATING: 10
My favorite cooperative game.  I've also played Pandemic and Shadows over Camelot (sort of co-op).

What I like:
- It's fast. A game plays in under 20 minutes.
- Time pressure requires every person to think for themselves and you cannot depend on a leader to guide you on everything.
- Difficulty of play can be altered with the basic and advanced threats.
- It's challenging for all player counts.  It definitely gets more challenging the fewer players you have.
- Requires true teamwork to survive.  You need to coordinate actions with others and trust that they will do what you agree on.
- You feel a sense of accomplishment when you survive a mission, and it's fun blaming others when you fail a mission.

What I don't like:
- Lots of pieces to setup/sort.  Playing multiple games in a single session helps reduce setup overhead.
- Sometimes bad card draws can make it impossible to deal with all threats.
- It's hard to have a mix of experienced/beginner players because there's a lot of rules to learn and you may have to go through the tutorial missions for the beginners.
- It takes up a lot of table space.

RATING: 9.5
This used to be one of my top10 favorites, but the difficulty has made it hard to get to table, so I don't know how it has dated.
I love this game. The original realtime co-op hit and still the best one. It's like a very nerdy partygame where you got to do logistic puzzles in middle of chaos. If that sounds boring then let's specify that the logistic puzzles involve blowing up ships. It's pretty much Star Trek: The Boardgame (one of those episodes where their ship is messed up and aliens attack). Sadly it's surprisingly heavy for such a light-hearted and fun game, so teaching it to others or even remembering the rules if you haven't played in a while is a huge pain. I'll give a very small minus for that, but it's still a 10 really. Awesome game.

Expansions:
+Space Alert: The New Frontier 
(Solid expansion if you happen to need more difficulty (and complexity) after beating all the original missions. It has some very good stuff, but definitely for very experienced players only!)

2-Player Comment:
*I must disagree with general BGG opinion - Space Alert is a good 2-player game. There's kind of dummy system, but it's very non-intrusive and also thematic if you imagine the bots as, well, bots (like bit dumber Data that you got to give commands to). It's bit more involved with 2, yes that's a shame as it's quite heavy as is, but it's also slightly easier to co-ordinate with just two "commanders" so it evens out to great, fun experience for all the couples and other 2p gamers out there. Don't skip this because of the player req if you're a co-op fan.

Roborally + Pandemic, set in space, with lots more options to worry about.  With scalable difficulty, and frantic decisions, there is a lot going on in this game.

This game is a real gem, but I'm glad to have someone else as captain and keep track of everything.  Happy to play it, but probably wouldn't get much use in my own collection.

Probably not suitable for non-gamers, as there is too much going on and it is rather unforgiving.

Kudos for this original game. Finally a co-op that doesn’t suffer from quarterbacking. Well, actually…

Turns out you can play this solo, and once you’ve mastered that, you really would do better to do everything yourself anyway. And as a solo game, it’s fun. But really it’s just ladder logic with increasing challenges/rules. And once you’ve mastered that, there’s no replayability. Still, you get a lot of training missions and real missions and challenges in the box, so it’ll be awhile before you’re bored. 

And since it requires sound (best anyway), it can be hard to play just anywhere. The learning curve is steep, but I love the baby step mission training scenarios they use. Good board, components and rulebook. Theme is great. 

But it only gets a 7 because of no replayability now solo and too hard to introduce to new folks. But for originality and first time experiences, it’s more like a 9. So I split that and put 8.

I love this game experience.  There is a steep learning curve and it can take a while to train new recruits.  The introduction booklet is a good tool for this.

Once you get going, the play is quite intuitive and each game round takes only 10 minutes.  At the end of such a short period of time, you really get the sense that you have pulled together as a team.  The atmosphere may overwhelm some.

Interesting game. Fun, but not quite as fun as I expected it to be. Reminiscent of RoboRally, but fixes RoboRally's most significant problem (IMO): that it takes ungodly long to play.
   I have yet to figure out how to effectively use the board during the action phase (first part of each game), because in general, no two players are simultaneously planning their actions for the same round. For example, I might be working on my Round 4 action while you're figuring out what you'll do in Round 5. How do we use the board in such a situation?

Having watched numerous videos on Youtube on how to play, and after reading the rule books...this game is a hot mess.  Watching 'how to play' videos for the game cemented this view.  The game is a cluster.  It looks like the opposite of fun.  The rule book(s) read as if they were written in a foreign language, then badly translated to English...which probably isn't too far from the truth.

I regret purchasing it.  Thankfully, it is still in shrink-wrap so I may be able to off-load it.

EDIT: After studying it more, and understanding the turn/phase sequence, I may give this game a second chance if I can find 4 players.

03/19/13 Played a four-player game. I do like the science fiction theme and the graphics look nice. But there are some very important things I don't care for. First, I detest cooperative games (everyone against the game system). Second, the game was played in a room with a lot of background noise and I couldn't understand 9/10's what the computer voice was saying. Third, and this isn't the game's fault per se, yet I include it because it negatively impacted my enjoyment of the game, it was explained poorly. Fourth, the "ten minute game" line is utter male bovine excrement. All in all it took 85 minutes for the explanation, tutorial game, simulation, and then the actual game. The owner then wanted to play it again. The rest of us looked at him like NO WAY IN HELL.

RATING: 9.5
This was very high on my want list when I first heard about it.
Now that I wrote the German rules and saw the artwork, it is on top position for Essen 2008 (competing with the BSG boardgame).

Basically, Vlaada took a puzzle which has to be solved by all players acting in a coordinated way. The puzzle evolves and changes in play and everything has to happen within a limited time frame.

The game may be prone to all cooperative's games "illness" that a leader will tell all other players what to do. In this case I doubt that it will be much of a problem ...

Of course, "puzzle" does not really nail the excitement of the dangers which threaten your crew and your ship. The game for me is a perfect blend of Galaxy Trucker (mayhem), Pandemic (cooperative play against the game), Squad Seven (stress factor by soundtrack giving orders and limiting the playing time), and Robo Rally (pre-planning of moves)...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Relatively simple mechanics (move in one of three directions or take one of four actions) hide the ridiculously complex interaction of working with your crew to survive a mission.

You will likely die and die a lot, but each loss gets you a little closer to that first taste of victory.

Space Alert is definitely best with 5 players and the learning curve is steep, but the short time of each mission keeps it from becoming too frustrating or overwhelming.

I haven't even considered a second look, because: it works only with 4 or 5 players, highly language dependent, the CD is clumsy and seriously limits the replayability, and the real-time play is just an uncontrollable chaos resulting random bushwacking. Yep, I was completely wrong in all and every accounts. Scales really well for 1-5 players, needs only one player to know the language, the replayability is off the scale, even playing the same mission over and over again and after the training missions you actually know what's happening and what to do. Very unique experience, a great game.

This is such a unique game!  As much as I've enjoyed cooperative games in the past, the added time element to this game definitely puts it in a category all by itself and makes it that much more exciting.  Take RoboRally, give it an ever-present time limit, then make it cooperative and the result is this wonderfully fun, challenging, and all-around great game.  The fact that the individual games never seem to last more than 15 or 20 minutes means that we always want to play again and again and again.  Thus far, all of the players were learning it together, so I'm a little worried about what will happen when I add players with different experience levels, but I'm hoping it won't be too much of an issue.  It's a little hard to get this one to the table due to the complexity, but I'm always glad when we do.

Game in a Nutshell: Plan out actions in real time to attempt to survive 10 minutes of onslaught and malfunction aboard the SS Sitting Duck.

Played as: 4,5 player (First two levels of the training program)

Pros: A uniquely designed game with a fun premise and great sense of humor. It definitely presents a new challenge for a coop and brings a great sense of camaraderie amongst your team of players. The CD is a fun touch and presentation gets an 'A'.

Cons: The challenge of the game is in just trying to understand what's going on. Not tough enough? Try adding more convoluted things to make it more confusing. It's counter intuitive to start into a game and not feel like you grasp what's going on. Yes, I understand that's basically the point, if everyone understood the game perfectly, you could simply get everything laid out logically and you could win virtually everytime. Instead it's a juggling act meant to confuse you... and I don't enjoy that as much as I thought I might. Oh, and it makes for a game that's a complete pain in the ass to teach.

Other: This is not a co-op you can play with anyone. This game is for gamers. I haven't made it all the way to the full game and I don't know if I ever will. It's like the players need to grow together in learning the game which makes it a bit difficult to get a commitment out of people who want to grudge through the growing pains.

Best Use: A gamer's co-op game.

I finally played this, after having played Escape the Curse of the Temple. I was surprised that Space Alert feels much calmer and less chaotic in comparison. 

I love that the game offers an experience that is unique, and has a good dose of humour. Communication is key, and everyone is forced to discuss and coordinate. 

I don't like that the rules are a chore to teach and are deliberately convoluted to create chaos. I also found the resolution round a little anti-climatic. Going through the steps and checks felt a little like doing my taxes.

I look forward to playing the game again some day.

This is a fast paced and VERY challenging starship simulator. I like the programming aspect, but this can get really hosed by some minor mistakes. The difficulty does create some very comedic mess ups most of the time, but sometimes they can just be aggravating.

Finally managed to give the game the time it deserved, it's been sitting in my collection unplayed for years. This is an EXCELLENT game, one of the most tense gaming experiences I've ever played. Initially it might sound like placing 12 cards in front of you is pretty straight forward, but it is a crazy and chaotic experience that requires good communication, smart planning, and a little bit of luck to win. We lost every mission we played, but we had a hell of a lot of fun losing!

The first word that comes to mind for the game is 'clever'.  Very intelligently-designed social game.  Nice tensions, good player interactions.  As a game, well... it would be better if you could have the time to get a 'feel' of the opponent: during the game, I had no idea who we were combating except it had 'such and such attack/defense' scores.  The game ends way too quickly for me: what, that was it?  The voice dic was pretty cool, and as I said, many clever mechanisms.  Will play if asked, but not a keeper for me.

Woohoo!!! I waited a year to order this. So far, I've had a lot of fun with it. I've played twice with the family, which was quite a hoot. My 5 year old totally got the concept of going to blue and firing rockets. Really cool! My game group had fun with it as well! So far, I'm 1-4, with my only win coming because of sheer luck on the first training mission.

"No matter how well we agree before the game starts what we're going to try and that we'll listen to one another, it always ends up in a big mess. Too many captains on one ship, and it's always painful. But still, it's all kinds of awesome, even if we fail miserably. Usually we need a few games to relearn all the rules and details, and by the time we start to get better at it again, that's also when the empty beer bottles start collecting at the table and we shout louder but we understand less."

RATING: 7
Cool cooperative game where players listen to a CD which alerts them to incoming or on-board threats that they need to handle.  As you're receiving incoming data you need to work as a team: players program their actions: move left, up, down or right, shoot laser, refeul laser or shields, launch robots, etc.  

Once the CD track stops playing you run through everybody's programmed moves one by one.  The planning phase can become chaotic and if one person played a card wrong it could have dire consequences.  Looking forward to playing more scenarios because the first 3 I tried seemed too easy (although good for learning the system).

Real-time action is not for me. If that is the only option for breaking the alpha player-problem then count me out.

RATING: 8.5
Live Red November, this is a true co-op game: the players are all playing on one team, and either win or lose the game together.  

Players are the crew of a space ship which is being warped into enemy territory for 10 minutes.  Those 10 minutes are played out in real time, with a CD announcing what threats occur during the 10 minutes, and when they occur.  The players each have 12 turns where they can carry out actions in the ship to defend it (charge shields, fire cannons, generate energy, etc.).  

The cool thing about the gaeme, though, is that during the 10 minute mission players are only creating a plan.  At the end of the 10 minutes the players reset the board, and then carry out all of their actions in turn and player order.  So, if people weren't working in sync, player 1 could try to fire the guns, but if player 2 hadn't already generated some energy, player 1 will just be clicking a dead button.

This game requires a tremendous amount of working together, and the training missions are brilliantly designed to slowly lead people into the full complexity of the game.  

The game is fun; I look forward to playing it more now that I've got the basic mechanics down.

RATING: 10
Space Alert is a major favorite of mine. The object is apparently to explore hostile deep space by yelling at everyone enough to forget what it was you were supposed to be doing in the first place. Augment your play with a running playback of the Star Trek: The Next Generation’s ambient engine noise. The first time your group plays, it's wise to have the most experienced player act simply as the instructor. I’m thrilled at how fun this short game is to simply watch, but playing is even more enjoyable. If you’ve ever wanted a realistic game crewing an intergalactic starship- well, you just might be fooled into thinking this game is for you. But if you can occasionally enjoy Galaxy Quest over Star Trek, Starship Troopers over Ender’s Game, or Munchkin over Dungeons & Dragons, then this game is right up your alley. First play a Simulation round, in which you might do reasonably well and not even die. Too bad you’re not supposed to keep score on Simulation Runs. You may even manage to earn a couple extra points for visual confirmation! (Otherwise known as looking out the window. But you do get points for it! Serious!) With your confidence buoyed by the successful Simulation Run, you may attempt a real mission, complete with internal threats, the C button, and robots. Those fickle, fickle robots. Suffice it to say that it will not go as well. For one thing, your ship may be overrun by internal threats alone. For another, trying to keep your security robot teams on task and not end up defending an empty room is... challenging. Stick with what you know, and look out the window again! Then the seeker droid can evade capture, blowing a gaping hole in the side of the ship so big you'll figure the kamikaze fighter will sail on through it. No such luck. 

I hear the expansion is really great, (it scores a 8.75 on BoardGameGeek!) but I really think I need to get better at the game to justify buying it.

RATING: 9.4
Good old Vlaada Chvátil.  Master of super clever ideas for games and then absolutely ossifying those into an unplayable monolith of rules.  Even doing this game's "short intro" (which was like 8 missions, each adding only a few of the rules of the game) was a serious amount of time and effort to wade through the piles of rules and intricacies.  We had a lot of fun when we eventually got going sort of (Justin and I), but we only got this to table because we set aside a whole afternoon of my vacation time/his visit to get through this game.

So, I will keep this rating of 9.4 because this is an AWESOME idea and a stupidly stressful sort of gameplay... but completely unplayable in the real world with real attention spans and schedules to juggle.

Finally got to play it with my regular group and had a blast! It should be noted that my "Mission CD" and "Tutorial CD" seem to have been mislabeled. We started up the Tutorial CD and it starts yelling about an internal threat. What the hell?

Roborally meets Galaxy Trucker. Fun, somewhat tense, lots of shouting at each other and running around, but the ending where everything is resolved really feels anti-climatic. I do love the audio soundtrack, but it's not really a game I have this burning desire to buy.
------------------------------------------------
Ratings revised after playing game again. I think part of my dislike of the game before was the quarterbacking, and the feeling that it took too long to resolve things in the second phase.  Playing with a different group solved all of those things and I had a blast! Can't wait to play it again and to share it with kids.

Like sex but better. Most games put co op on the box, Which usually translates to alpha gamer say 'do this or we die' and said gang do it or die (cough cough legends of andor). Space alert is easily the most co op game on the market (which I've come across). The great thing is you do have to work together but because of the nature of the game you don't have alpha gamer breathing down your neck because they are far to busy trying to sort their section of the ship. What I like about space alert is crew/players make decisions and more importantly make  actions of their own choosing. We ran a campaign where we used the game of space alert but we were members of the crew of twilight imperium vessels. Oh happy days.

RATING: 6
Thrilled to play someone else's copy. The game is fresh, innovative, relatively quick, quirky, and fun. I've never played anything else like it, and I look forward to trying it again.

However, Space Alert is ultimately just not my style of game. I prefer more strategic, "brain burning" gamer game with an epic feel. Tense, reactionary, and forcing you into mistakes, Space Alert is far from that type of game. Thus, while it will never make it into my own collection, I'm glad it's gotten into so many others.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
This might be my favorite game. It is so much fun, and so hectic, and you're never completely sure that you're gonna win. I love playing this with whoever wants to play! 

Yes, the game is immensely complex, and takes far longer to learn than a single game's play time, but I am forgiving of this in light of how good the gameplay is. Plus, the complexity gives it great replayability. 

The 10-minute play time is golden (I think the game is medium heavy in game play weight due to the extremely short game time; otherwise it would be a solid heavy), and the soundtrack mechanic is super unique (I'm a big fan of creative and original mechanics, like Hanabi's outward-facing cards). 

Looking forward to trying New Frontier.

Designer Vlaada (Vladimír) Chvátil comes up with some very unique games, but somehow they haven't really clicked for me.  Galaxy Trucker and Space Alert are very nicely produced games with lots of bells and whistles but both have left me wanting more. I really thought I would enjoy Space Alert because the idea reminded me of the fun times I had in a simulator at The Christa McAuliffe Space Education Center. A crisis would show up on the main screen and everyone had to do their jobs to prevent the ship from blowing up.

For me, Space Alert failed because the post-mortem to resolve the real-time decisions is boring and methodical contrasted to the mayhem during the real-time events with the CD computer voice.  If the outcome could be worked into the real-time phase that would be cool.

The ultimate programmed movement game, in my opinion. It's vibrant, thematic, and tense. The downside? It might be too tense, as players are under a real time constraint. I like the "resolution" phase, which is similar to the feel of Galaxy Trucker's scoring journey after the building phase.

Fantastic sci-fi action game!

Although at first the rules seem intimidating and complex (it comes with two reasonable sized booklets), the game itself is easy to grasp once you understand the basics.

The chaotic planning round is brilliant and with the CD shouting at you and unpredictable enemies popping out on you this game plays fast and hard.

It's so easy for a team of players to make a seemingly good plan that completely falls apart once you play out the events and see what actually happened, as a single card slip or timing error can cost the whole game!

Plays best with all 5 players, but sadly can be quite inaccessible as the steep learning curb means all rookies must be fully "trained" before you can really get to grips with the game (as you won't get time to explain during the missions!).

Best mission score so far: 40 points/5 player mission.

Everything you've heard about this game, good and bad, is 100% true. Yes, there is shouting. Yes, there is stress. Yes, there is loosing. Yes, it is amazingly fun. The four of us played for about 10 hours straight. So much beer, so much time, so many games, so much fun. I'll never forget it.

UPDATE: Five years later and, no, I have not forgotten that first magical night. I should mention however that it has never been that fun again. It's still great but it's not the world killer that evening suggested. We've pulled it out twice since despite numerous other opportunities. We all seem to feel the same way, "Hey, SPACE ALERT! Remember that night. Yeah. Ha. Wanna play again!?... Uhm. Well. How about something else? Yeah, ok, me too."

A fun game which has more re-playability than Galaxy Trucker. The mechanics of the Roborally style movement programming works really well and everyone has a significant role to play in order to keep the spacecraft intact to complete the mission.
Recommended for group play.

You are a crew member on a small spaceship that’s teleported far across the universe for 10 real-time minutes to scan unmapped and undoubtedly dangerous sectors of the galaxy.

Wow!  This game is intense & fun.  Best co-op I've played (out of Pandemic, Battlestar Galactica, Shadows over Camelot, Forbidden Island, & Red November). What a great theme & implementation.  Solid 9 after first 4 simulation runs.  What actually makes this game shine and forces TRUE cooperation is the real TIME nature of the threats to the team.  The designer of this game has some serious skills.  I'm glad I picked this game up and finally got a chance to play it.

Games like this are best when they are simplified. Maybe not as simple as Escape: Curse of the Temple, but there definitely needs to be a nice sweet spot there. Unfortunately, this designer likes to make games that are complex for the sake of complexity, and this is one of the worst culprits of that.

A real-time co-op with identity problems. It calls for people to constantly discuss their next moves, yet they have to be quiet to listen for what threats are marching in. The result is a form of complete and utter chaos which doesn't make for a good game in my mind.

Gamer group too small (at 3) to really get a good play on this. While the rule book has a great sense of humor, it doesn't really translate to play. Relatively high stress and when you make a mistake can feel like you let the whole group down.

More challenging than Space Cadets, requires a larger group, and both more coordination and more skill. Unless you are hardcore, I would recommend Space Cadets.

In this co-operative game, players are in a space ship under attack from outside and inside. Player preplan their moves (moving up, down, left, right, or pressing a particular button to fire lasers and so forth), and resolve the actions. A CD is provided for players to follow the instructions. The CD provides a number of variations, and informs you which direction the threats are coming from, and even introduces things like static, which means you cannot talk to your fellow players. 

The rules are funny to read, and the gameplay is very fun. Rating likely to go up after more plays. I definitely want to play this more!

Ok components, nothing wrong with the theme, on it's face looks like an ALRIGHT GAME but....

Turns out, thanks to revolutionary real-time mechanics, brilliantly balanced gameplay and varied decisions made in a crunch, this is one of the most brilliant, fun, satisfying new games of the last 10 years. There's so much to enjoy with this game that's completely new. It's simultaneously extremely quick to play while still being an absolute brain-burner that's stimulating and engaging without ever be overwhelming or sluggish.

If you like coop games or just really good games, BUY THIS, It's perfect for 4 players but still plays well with 2. I absolutely love this game that is such a mix of good old ideas and amazingly original new ideas!

Space Alert has players do incredibly simple things such as push buttons and levers, with the challenge coming solely from arbitrary restrictions such as the time limit and the bizarre action programming mechanic--it's the board game equivalent of a video game with bad controls.

RATING: 7.5
This game is completely novel for me.  It proves to be a real challenge, but each game is completely winnable, you just have to figure out what needs to be done.  The game fills players with a sense of panic that must be fought to think through your actions.  A CD player is used to announce events and challenges that come up in the game that players must respond to.  It is very fast paced.  Games last only about a half hour or so, and are filled with actions for every player to do.

I had heard a LOT of hype about this and was eager to try it out. As so often happens, the game was a bit of a disappointment. I thought it was a great idea, but the choices just felt dull. Also, the fact that the slightest error can ruin your plans is the same reason why I dislike Robo Rally. I would gladly play it again, but that's about the best I can say about this inventive game. **UPDATE** Further plays with a different group upped my rating. The harder scenarios are much more fun and I do look forward to more plays now.

This game tops CitOW as the most difficult game in my collection to teach to new players. I tend to just give the most barebones explanation, give everybody a distinct role, and play a round with nobody knowing what they're doing for sure. By the end of the resolution phase, nearly everything has clicked, and they're ready to give it another shot.

As for the game itself... meh. I just haven't found it to be very fun. I'll give it a few more tries, but so far my first impression hasn't been great.

A co-op that asks you to react quickly to an audio track so that your team can move around the ship with commands like in Roborally (the way cards say, 'move 1 space forward').  The game was interesting, but I do not enjoy reaction time type games, plus listening to the audio track was annoying to me.

Feel a little wrong rating it on only 3 plays of the training mode with 2 players... but boy is this game a blast. The time limit keeps things intense and prevents people from talking about how to deal with one particular move for 10 minutes. 

I've had a hard time pitching it to other people. It's an intimidating game. Rule book is great!

Edit: I may have to get rid of this game, and it is going to make me SO SAD. I simply can not get people to play this game with me! I have loved almost every second of playing it. Set up is a real pain.

RATING: 9
Space Alert avoids the cooperative genre's one of the biggest problem - one player can play the game for others - by having such a strict time limits that it's practically non-issue. I first thought that CD-soundtrack would be more of a gimmick but because it pushes the game forward in high speed it actually is very essential part of the game. I still dislike the idea that you are more or less forced to have an audio equipment where you play. But as this usually isn't a too big problem it's a very minor minus in otherwise excellent game. (Update: As you can play the soundtrack from a cell phone speaker and thats enough at (otherwise) quiet environment it is really a non-issue).

Playing Space Alert is both very noisy and very fun. Because of time limit and occasional space noise (prevents you from talking) you need to think, coordinate and act fast to pull through the mission. For a good coordination you need someone that is guiding others on the macro level but other players cannot solely rely on the "mastermind" to make all decisions for them and they must act on their own. Because of this, after a successful mission it feels that players really have cooperated. 

An excellent game and definitely one of the best - if not the best - cooperation games.

I am really starting to dislike Vlaada, the more games I play of his the more headaches I get.  And it comes down to one thing: his rule books.  When the narrative of your rulebooks outweighs the actual outline of the rules, there's an issue.  

This is one of those games that has 2 books, a handbook [for your first few adventures] and the rulebook, which looks amazingly a lot like a properly written rulebook.

The game is simple, like really really simple.  It's relatively intuitive and like most Vlaada games it just plays itself, for better or worst.  So why two books?  It's a pain to get through the book, but at least he highlights the actual rules in the handbook.  If you don't understand what I mean go find a copy of the rulebook online, it's mostly narrative and poorly outlined examples.

So is the game good?  It's like most Vlaada games, very meh worthy.  I have a great board game group and we made the utter most of it, saluting one another by rank, making cliche lines and jokes from sci-fi movies, but those of us who have played Galaxy Trucker, we just felt like merchants.  The game doesn't make you actually feel like you could be on the enterprise or something.

I feel like any license could bogart these mechanics and and concepts and add in some real sci-fi nuances to the game and make a game that everyone will want to play.

So it's a 6.5, the game is good.  Is it worth retail value?  Absolutely not.  
Is it worth the time spent playing?  Yes.  
Does the game have replay value even though it's limited to a set number of tracks?  Surprisingly yes.

So in conclusion, this game feels like you're in space, but you're nothing special, just trying to survive.  The real game is between the players.  The components are Vlaada, you like it or don't.  I don't, it doesn't at all feel like the sort of Sci-Fi I want.  I may even mock up a completely new board for the game based on the Enterprise or something.

RATING: 8.5
Gioco unico nel suo genere: cooperativo che piacerà anche ai non amanti del genere perché in Space Alert ognuno è realmente responsabile delle proprie azioni e della pianificazione da cui ne dipenderanno le sorti dell'intera missione; un lavoro non coordinato porterà ad un'inevitabile sconfitta e distruzione della vostra astronave di classe: bersagio facile. Seguendo delle tracce audio si dovranno contrastare una serie di attacchi nemici che metteranno a dura prova la vostra astronave e l'equipaggio intero. Per un buon lavoro di squadra sarà necessario suddividersi i compiti: capitano, responsabile tattico, addetto alle comunicazioni, ecc. Adrenalina, caos, risate e divertimento sono gli elementi ben miscelati dal grande Vlaada Chvátil che ci presenta un altro originalissimo gioco, anche questa volta il regolamento, che diventa un libricino, è molto divertente. Gioco spassosissimo!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.8
Certainly one of a kind. An insane ten minutes really captures the spirit of the game, and it's all too easy (and admirable) to slip into Kirk-Spock-Scotty mode. The gradual destruction of your ship and the realisation that you've actually done it all wrong is every bit as enjoyable. The concept is so radical and unique that it reflects no end of credit onto the designer's reputation and imagination.

Obviously not feasible to play in public!

While I like the game and what it is trying to accomplish, my game buddies (in different groups) did not. It's kinda hard unless you really learn the game, and then it ceases being fun.

A very engaging take on the cooperative genre that plays like a mix between RoboRally and Galaxy Trucker.  As usual, the presentation and quality of the game is top-notch, no complaints there.  The Ameritrashers should love this game.

That said, the game isn't a deep-analysis game (which is exactly the sort of game I tend to favor), and it's just ten minutes.  Granted, a *very exciting* ten minutes, but I am still left with a feeling of "that's all?" after a mission.

I'm sure I'll play this game a lot more, and I'll definitely enjoy doing so--keep in mind that it's best with people who can get into their roles--but it will never be a top-ten game.  Nevertheless, thanks to Mr. Chvatil for continuing to bring refreshing ideas to the gaming world.

RATING: 10
Really well-done cooperative game. Players shout at each other for 10 minutes trying to coordinate themselves while a CD tells them the arriving threats. It really gives you the idea to be in danger and presses you. At the same time, it gives you the idea of indecision, while wasting precious minutes deciding whether going left or right, pressing lasers or shields.
Its longevity is guaranteed by mixing randomly drawn action cards (which limit you a little the amount of possible operations), enemies, enemy's speed tracks and CD tracks.
Its only missing thing is competition, being a cooperative game.
IT NEEDS THE RIGHT GROUP.

Completely different coop game. Maybe like coop RoboRally? Definitely 4-5 players only.
It seems no one at my house likes it, and the standard solo variant sucks.
The "Little Duckling" variant may be good for 2-3 players (I don't know), but its solo rules are broken. (FWIW, I did the updated artwork.)
If you're considering this game and see the "1-5 Players" and think that you can fall back on solo play if necessary, forget it. You must have at least 4 players.

A lot of fun and it seems to solve the "one guy runs the show" problem of other co-op games (Pandemic, Descent, Mansions of Madness, etc.). Hectic and zany. Players who prefer a more measured game experience will not love this.

RATING: 7
It's multi-player RoboRally, where you need to co-ordinate movement and firing actions across 12 phases. The more you play, the calmer and better you get, but things can go horribly wrong if just one player does something unexpected ... like draining energy from where you need it leaving one player shooting blanks, meaning an incoming threat (a Galaxy Trucker type card moving closer down a range scale each turn) can do damage that was thought dealt with, that then screws up other things. 

So ... a tight, time pressured co-operative game requiring real communication and real co-operation where one player can't dominate. Six times in, I'm looking to play harder scenarios and see how good we can get. A thumbs up.

First impressions: Not good. Based on one aborted session, it seems a bit heavier than its 2.9 rating. Sure, you just have to push one of 3 buttons or move in one of 3 directions each turn. But there are power flow rules, rockets, incoming aliens, internal threats, etc, etc, etc,. 

I hadn't read the rules before we sat down to play, because people said it was most fun to learn the game together, from scratch. Big mistake. The tutorial is hard to read (tiny black print on a gray background!?), verbose (no way my wife is sitting through 10 minutes of flavor text), and not entirely clearly written (it tells you to play the CD before you actually should).

Purely cooperative games don't usually go over well for me, but I rather liked this one.  It's got quite a bit of fun times to it.  Chaos abounds, which keeps the game exciting.  Plus, it seems like this one keeps you on your toes with the difficulty.  Every mission seems to be right on the cusp between "we got this easy" and "oh god, oh god, we're all gonna die!"  Perfect.

Additionally, I think the time constraints keep this game from being easily dominated by one player, since nobody could manage all 5 players and their cards simultaneously while listening to the CD and pulling stuff and everything else you have to consider.

A very interesting concept. You play out the game in real time and due to the sound track, learn of "threats" to the ship as you are planning, so you need to adapt. then after the live planning, you play it out and see what went wrong. It was cool to plan the first time, but it seems like a lot of management and almost like work at the end. Worth a try and I am glad I played, but not really for me.

Non sono obiettivo. Come espresso pubblicamente e in altri commenti, Vlaada Chvatil è uno dei miei autori preferiti: oltre al fatto che si ricordava di me quando l'ho conosciuto ad Essen :), è un autore poliedrico che concepisce bei giochi con ambientazioni e meccaniche molto diverse tra di loro (penso a Galaxy Trucker, Through the Ages, Graenaland, Prophecy).
La sua incursione nel genere cooperativo lascia il segno: uno dei difetti principali di questo genere di giochi è che uno dei giocatori tende a diventare il supervisore del gruppo, trasformando il gioco in un enorme solitario. 
Chvatil risolve questo problema in due modi: istituendo di fatto un capitano, obbligato dal regolamento a fare il supervisore, e mettendo il pepe sulla coda di tutti creando un "gioco lungo 7 minuti che dura mezz'ora".
Space Alert riprende il filone umoristico di Galaxy Trucker già nel manuale, che sembra un estratto della Guida Galattica di Douglas Adams. Il gioco, che ha meccaniche davvero innovative (decisioni in tempo reale, "sbobinatura" della missione, missione fornita da una traccia audio) rendono la partita veloce, snella e tatticamente complessa nel suo svolgimento: nel pochissimo tempo a disposizione, il capitano deve accertarsi che ogni minaccia sia presa in carico, che tutti lavorino in maniera coordinata e che nessuno faccia cavolate. Chi spara cannonate deve contare su quello che al piano di sotto ricarica le batterie, chi alza gli scudi deve sperare che un compagno lanci i droidi di difesa all'attacco degli intrusi. E tutti devono affidarsi al giocatore che, al momento giusto, impedisce al computer di attivare lo screensaver e spegnere la nave!
La combinazione tra minacce, tracciati e tracce audio garantisce elegantemente una longevità adeguata (ho fatto più di 20 partite, una diversa dall'altra). Per i più esperti, che possono regolare la difficoltà del gioco aggiungendo minacce più difficili, è prevista anche una modalità "campagna", che rende il gioco ancora più avvincente.
Credo che il principale difetto del gioco sia l'eterogeneità dei giocatori. Trattandosi di un gioco dove tutti si mettono nella mani degli altri, un inesperto al tavolo di giocatori navigati mette gli altri davanti a un bivio: scegliere missioni più facili o rischiare di non terminarle.
Rimane comunque un piccolo capolavoro, il migliore a mio parere nel genere dei cooperativi.

This boardgame is a masterpiece! Awesome cooperative play. It's innovative, addictive and fun. You are under constant pressure and must really cooperate and communicate with other players if you want to beat the game. The rules are easy to assimilate and it takes about 20 minutes max/game. The campain mode is epic. My favorite coop boardgame. Don't forget to look by the porthole.

RATING: 7
Excellent if somewhat chaotic co-op game where you must work together to keep your spacecraft in one piece until your mission is complete. 

The game is played in two parts, the first is in real-time against a soundtrack representing the ships computer which highlights the various threats that you need to deal with by planning out your actions. In second part you work through the actions you and your team selected during the first phase and see if the resulting chaos is sufficient to save your ship from destruction! 

A warning to those who hate to lose, this game is tough! That said, the majority of the fun is in watching your carefully laid plans unravel as your crew blunder about the ship. It should also be mentioned that the rules for the game are reasonably complicated, which may put off some less experienced gamers. However, the game comes with a handbook which walks you through a number of training missions which gradually introduce the various features, so it is pretty easy to pick up if you have time to walk through these scenarios.

Overall Space Alert is superb fun, I would heartily recommend you get a bunch of friends together and give it a try if you can!

After all the tutorial missions and the first mission the game feels OK, but I'm feeling something is missing. It feels more like a party game (but it really is not). Maybe after a few more difficult missions I am willing to change my opinion.

The game was quite simple. Easy to learn...at least the basics, but takes a couple of missions to really get a grasp how it should be played. This is not such a bad thing because of the shortness of the missions.

November 2010: I'm willing to rise my rating from 7 to 8. The game just feels more fun than before. Maybe it is because I'm over the tutorial phase or maybe it is because of company.

A fun co-op with great theme integrated in it.  I like how it's based on real-time, has the different stations of the ship, and people have to really work together.  Due to the time element, the alpha player is lessened as well.

This game was hard to get to the table.  Generally need a CD player (or imported into a mobile device.)  Also tough to play later at night when kids are sleeping.  Also tough to get out if you have a player notorious with AP.

RATING: 7
Takes awhile to get good at this game. It is very difficult to succeed initially, especially if you don't function well under-pressure. 

You need a light hearted group to play this game, but serious enough to want to succeed. If your group is too serious or competitive, then the frustration level is going to go through the roof. 

It's best to play this game with the mindset that you are going to fail a lot before you succeed. It will take a few games of the same mission with the same play group before you are successful.

Space Alert really boils down to being a dynamic timed group solved puzzle. Yeah that may sound lame to some, but it actually very fun, intense, and crazy. Success and failure is completely up to your team. Nothing random about it (well, except for the mission threats and locations).

It really captures the cooperative team nature while still allowing for individual responsibility and decision making. Other co-ops can at times devolve into one person playing most of the game for everyone else. Not so in Space Alert.

The expansion makes this game rank higher.

solo is ok and good for practice.

edit: after more plays I'm not sure about the staying power of this one. I enjoyed it a lot at first but the shine is wearing off. I suppose the timed puzzle nature of the game isn't appealing to me as it once did. Still a good team work exercise.

Bit of a learning curve for us... the tutorial and mission CDs were mislabled, so it took us a bit to figure out that we weren't playing the startup mission CD. Once that was squared away, our test run actually made sense when compared with the handbook info. 

I really like this game a lot -- it's more like a challenging puzzle because I like replaying the same scenarios over again until I get them "right." Really fun, but I can't imagine teaching anyone else how to play, so this is mainly going to be a solo game.

If you like a good coop-puzzle which you need to work at to master it (read ; play multipe times because you're going to need the training) look no further. This game will be perfect for you. Not just good, perfect.

RATING: 8.5
I absolutely love a tough nut to crack, and this is a hard game to win.  The preprogrammed moves work really well in this game to add a great deal of tension, hurry and occasional panic.  I love that this is a cooperative game where everyone is scrambling and listening for cues and trying to work together in such a short space of time.  I think the theme is tremendously well matched to the mechanics.

The only reason that I don't want to go out and buy it is because you need a cd player or laptop within arms reach to make it happen.  I wouldn't want the game not to have that, I don't think it would work with out that audio component, and I think the audio cues are some of the funniest and cleverest things about playing the game.  But somehow I find it a little difficult to mentally get over that set-up issue.  

One of the things that attracts me to boardgaming is that I don't need electronics to have a good time.  I find that having so much fun away from gizmos feels very therapeutic since I spend so much time in front of a computer for work.  So the need for electronics is my only disappointment with this game, but it's a significant one.

RATING: 9
The only reason this isn't a perfect 10 is because it's so hard to get to the table. I'm rarely gaming with the same group twice, so by the time I guide a new group through 90 minutes of practice missions, we're ready to move onto something different, with a new group of people. I've thoroughly enjoyed the challenge of the solo game though, and this would be a perfect 10 if I could find a consistent group to play it with.

Another awesome game from the designer of Galaxy Trucker - this time a co-op! Again, the real-time play make this a very tense experience. Probably the most intense game I own, this certainly stands out from most other games.

There are various ways to ramp up the difficulty to maintain interest over time, and it isn't exactly an easy game to begin with. Definitely the sort of game where you need to learn from previous attempts to improve.

The theme & tie-ins with Galaxy Trucker are nicely done. Components are great, and support on the website is good so far (MP3 versions of CDs) with more mission downloads etc. promised for the future.

Plays fine with 2-3 players, though is much harder to learn that way as you also have to manage the androids' moves as well as your own, all in the same limited time! Better experience with 4-5 players.

OWN: Original/1st Czech Games Edition (the one that includes 2xCDs & Scenario Cards). Appears to be compatible enough with the current version of 'The New Frontier' expansion that I own, although cards in expansion are slightly thinner (sleeving solves this!).

Really great concept. Unheard of to have a coop game done in real time. Amazing components. I just wish I could beat it! We have tried and tried and cannot even beat the training scenario.

The tension and quick-thinking features are great, though there are some serious flaws. The cards that come up must be thoroughly read and processed if you are to achieve sound victory, however with only one copy of the card, 3+ players, and a ton of other things to do, that becomes impossible. Bad too is how a monster will come out, and it will take 4 turns to kill, and pretty much if you don't kill it in those 4 turns it will kill you, which means that as enemies comes out you must devote 100% of your time to offense against that creates for those 4 turns, which makes strategy pretty boring. You don't even really have a choice in actions — say, I let it hit me because doing something else is more important — as ignoring it even temporarily means death.

Not yet played. Not my usual type of game, but I chose it because it can be played solitaire. Having read the basic rules It seems far more suited to playing with others. I can't yet decide whether it will be a hit with my friends.

I never got round to playing it properly, sold at UKGE 2017.

Oh dear god this game is hard, and that's when you have a half-competent team. Throw in some terrible communication and inability to get clear decisions across the board and you have mass-disaster. Pretty funny when you resolve the scenario only to discover somebody went the other side of the ship and everyone else thought they were taking care of those aliens... Can get frustrating when it goes too far in that you literally cannot get players to work together, but that's not really the fault of the game.

Saying I liked this 'a bit' is actually a lot more positive than it sounds: I really don't like the "Wow, it's so funny how all my plans fell apart, LOL!" aspect of Galaxy Trucker (same designer), or other programmed action games like the (undeserved IMO) SdJ winner, Colt Express. However, the program/puzzle here is less prone to chaotic external influence and just your team's mistakes. First play I made a mistake on Action 2 which invalidated every subsequent card (we missed the 'Oops' rule, apparently). Second game was better, got everything right and - apart from an unlucky turbo-lift failure - would have seen a score of 25. Not my kind of game, but also not one I'd turn down. Spaced out.

Really cool, Chvatil somehow has the ability to create new and different games with awesome themes.  This is so tense it can be almost stressful for certain people (like my wife unfortunately...).  When you get a crew that clicks together and starts to make good decisions and communicate, it is really fun.  Somehow feels much different than other co-op games.  Everybody is essential, you don't have any one person in control making optimal moves for everyone else.

RATING: 7
I like it, but teaching the game is like trying to explain quantum physics to gorillas.   Eventually, the people you're trying to teach it to are going to get frustrated and bored, and start wondering why they're trying so hard to get to the fun.  
Games shouldn't be like that if they hope to have a wide audience.  That said, among a group of gamers, it is fairly intuitive after a (losing) play through or two, and the brilliance of the design starts to kind of bleed through.  Slowly.  
I'm not crazy about most games that have a "required soundtrack", but this one implements it well, and joins Escape as one of the few board games that have successfully made this merge without too much pain.  
I like Space Alert.  Don't misunderstand me.  But it is too hard to teach to newish gamers, and therefore, will likely join the pile of games that I'll try to teach in a few years once they've forgotten about their first awful experience with it.  
Hopefully.

Very unique cooperative gameplay, but very difficult to get on the table; players either love or hate this game.

It's easier with AI because I can coordinate very easily to attack the same external threat on the same turn. Sadly less chaos = less surprises/shocks = less fun for me.

Will play again but only with 4 players and above.

Got to play it again this time 5p and 4p, one being simulation round and second the advanced simulation round, we misfired on an external threat in the second round and let it survive to destroy us, it was fun but not as fun as the first time I played it. But I would still love to take it out and play.

RATING: 10
For me, this is the best game ever.
PROS:
- relatively easy to learn (it takes some time - about an hour to explain the basic rules to newbies, but from my experience more time invested in training is rewarded in much better joy while playing full game) - there is comlete training plan prepared, so nothing to fear.
- action - if you want real action full of chaos, stress, fun, thrill,... this is IT!
- if you could buy the expansion - The New Frontier - it adds much more motivation to play again and again - mainly due to personal diaries, and character development. The game now completely drags you into action when you are trying get more and more experience for your character, and trying not to lose it.
- it is different - sometimes you need to relax from coherent building of your farms, dungeons, roads, vilages or what so ever and feel something "real" or at least "real time"
- it is quick. For such a complex game it is incredible, you could play it in 30 minutes.

CONS:
- not many girls want to play it. But if you take your time... However I think this game is more suitable for girls, as they can cover more actions at one time and cope with the role in the crew.

One word: CLEVER. Yes, the mechanics are a bit too abstract for my tastes, but the CD part simulates very well some of the on board life of a space ship.
This game is a rare gem in originality and a fantastic 'true' cooperative game, the best 'true' cooperative I've ever played.
As someone around wrote "Space Alert is not a 'normal' game. It is a game in a different dimension". I cannot agree more, it is a whole experience.
Artwork and components are also very good and the rules booklet is well designed and fun to read.

In my opinion an absolute must for every boardgame player and collector.

I bought this on the recommendation of Quintin Smith of Shut Up and Sit Down, as he claims it to be his favorite game of all time. After over a year, I still haven't had a chance to play it yet. I really want to.

EDIT: After playing the training simulations, this is already pure magic. Nothing will ever make you feel more like you're on an actual spaceship in the middle of actual chaos. You have to accept that sometimes things are going to go wrong and collapse, but working to overcome those moments is the fun of it.

EDIT: This is the real deal. Every game is exciting, and the outcome is never certain until the very end.

Apart from the superfrenzy created by the real-time aspect of the game, the core game is still a basic coopeative puzzler. I did enjoy it but was both underwhelmed by the strategic possibilites and the non-thematic experience and overwhelmed by the diffictulty of communicating with your fellow players. I have only played a basic (training) version of the game and maybe I will need to explore it more and play with right people as well, but for now, this is a mixed bag for me and I would rather play a similar game (puzzler like Ghost Stories or Space disaster like BSG) but indulge in what the game generates in atmosphere and tension instead of rushing though it like that.

EDIT: Played this with the 'right' group of people, finally, a few of my close friends and really enjoyed it this time. I think this is a great game if you have good group and are interested in playing though all the missions.

This is a great coop game like no other. Due to the limited time all players must collaborate in order to win - which is tough.

I'll bump the rating up to a solid 8 after getting a few more plays of Space Alert. It's definitely a co-op game and one of the rarer ones where you get those truly celebratory feelings when a friend manages to reload the reactor just in time for you to shoot.

In typical co-op games, everyone is excited by a roll of dice etc, but in this one, someone's actions can have long lasting effects which have ultimately turned the tide of the game.

There's enough hair-raising situations especially with internal threats where you need to briefly metagame the situation to lock down where exactly is the threat going to move at a certain turn and then head there to intercept and destroy it. Read the situation wrong and you're either too late or too early.

It's a fantastic game, but I recommend running through the tutorial and simulated mission (with new players) before embarking on the real one. All of them are still fun to play.

RATING: 9
Space Alert is a blast to play!  I love how frantic and crazy it is when everyone is talking and no one is communicating.  The connection between theme and mechanics is one of the strongest I've noticed in any game that I've played.  The theme and the mechanics need each other and grow organically out of each other.

I love that each player is forced to do his/her own thing and forced to make his/her own decisions.  Space Alert really is a coop that requires the cooperation of every player to win the game.  While it is better to have one decisive person say, "Red player go to the reactor and add some fuel; blue player, make sure you fire the gun," each player must individually decide if that is the right thing to do.  Each player must make choices and if the collective choices of the group are correct, then the ship has a good chance of surviving.  Sometimes the odds are too steep, but that just adds variety and excitement to the most thrilling game that I have ever played.

The only thing stopping me from rating Space Alert a ten is the tendacy for players to get mean and grumpy at each other.  It's only a game!  But the theme can cause players to be so involved that they can get mean and angry at other players more easily than any other game that I have ever played.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
To me there is a fundamental problem with cooperative games; the general syndrome.  In Pandemic, Ghost Stories, even BSG and Shadows it's too easy for one player to end up dictating everyones moves.  All it takes is one comment about a move someone is pondering is not so good, or how there is a great move they didn't see, and suddenly that player becomes the commander, controlling the whole game with the limited feedback of the others players.  I know it doesn't always go this way, but it sometimes does.

Space Alert addresses this beautifully with the time pressure that is introduced from the CD tracks.  Even someone who prefers to control everything isn't going to be able to, and players are just going to have to trust that the other players were competent and did what they needed to do.  This makes the coop experience much more enjoyable as a result. This is easily the best coop experience I've tried.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
It took a while for me to grow to love Space Alert, but after all the trial and error, and I mean LOTS of error, the frustration wears off and the fun begins. It can be a chore getting a group of dedicated gamers to work through the training missions, but the truth is this game is simply brilliant once you're actually prepared for it. Just make sure you have a calm, collected captain who speaks clearly or things might have a tendency to start...blowing up.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Best co-op I've played. Absolutely destroys Pandemic and Forbidden Island. I love the tension, the chaos, and the feeling of complete hopelessness when nothing is going right.

I don't play this one to win, but to have a good time and maybe create a fun story with some friends. Don't read that as I don't try to win, it's just that the game is fun regardless of the outcome. Highly recommended!

It works, it's different, it's hmmm.
Basically an exercise in logistics and reading small text upside at speed. The game has a planning stage where you see what is coming and plan for it, and then an execution phase. If this was for "real" you would have a captain, an intruder tracker, a "Scotty" in the engine room and their word would be be law: trouble is that that doesn't present much of a way to play a game.

Without the randomness of the resolution stage of Galaxy Trucker, this also lacks a lot of the fun. This would be an excellent solitaire game. As it stands it is a working but not spectacular multi-player co-op game, saved for me by the realtime element. Well worth playing if you can find it, but won't have much staying power.

RATING: 9
Excellent coop game in space from Vlaada Chvatil, who once again manages to perfectly mix a thematic gaming experience with engaging mechanisms.

This game does not suffer alpha gamer problem (because of the real time aspect), but quite high entry hurdle. This game is 50% planning ahead quickly and 50% communication (the key is to tell your team not everything, but only what they need to know). The feeling to barely survive the alien attack is very unique. 

The game has quite a steep learning curve and you need some plays before you can play it well (which is the only complaint I have about Space Alert). However, I have very good experience with introducing one new player in a team of veterans. On the third run (at latest) the newbie is a full team member!

The game is really demanding when planning ahead. It can be very hard to calculate under time pressure, in which round the enemy will do what action and how to react to this. With the different enemy categories, the difficulty level can be very well adjusted. Of course, there may be situations which seem impossible to solve, but it is not so frequent that it is frustrating. In the end this game does certainly not suffer from being too easy.

Players are members of space mission, attempting to protect their ship from external threats while it scans a sector of deep space. The game is played in "real-time," as a series of 10-minute missions. An audio CD representing the ship's computer announces incoming threats, causing a chaotic scramble amongst players as they attempt to find a way to maximize the cards each has been dealt to sequentially perform tasks required to counter each threat (move throughout the ship, recharge guns, fire them, etc.). Of course, there is never enough time, and the chaos only makes it more difficult.

I remember the first time seeing the box for Space Alert. I was killing time in the Ihrysko store in Bratislava and took the game down in their library and had a look through it. After 20 minutes of just looking through the pieces and the rulebook, I still had little idea how to actually "play" the game as I was reading through the "fun parts" where the crew are given their flight orders :)

Fast forward a few months and I picked this up 2nd hand at our local board game meetup in Dublin, when someone arrived in and said he was selling it for €10. Watched a "how to play" video on Youtube and we were ready to go. Myself and my girlfriend played the tutorial missions together and I was hooked. So you can already guess that this will be a positive review!

To start with, the box is sturdy and the artwork is very good. The components are all good quality and there's no colour blind issues to worry about. Once you know what all the pieces do, you'll be able to setup a game very quickly. The instruction manual is very cleverly put together. There are a series of tutorial missions set out. As you pass one, the next mission will introduce a new ability that you can use in the ship. And you need that gentle introduction! There is a lot to understand about how the ship works and it would be very harsh to try and dump it all on the players at once! I feel the teaching level presented is very good to help give players a chance to ease into the game. All in all, great production value.

This game is very much in it's own category. I know of no other games that play like this. After the tutorial missions, there is a lot of hidden information on the board that absolutely requires the players to communicate with each other. And time is of the essence, you're against the clock. It's a very strict clock at that, once he says phase or mission over - that's it. No more playing cards, no going back and changing things. This game can be unforgiving if/when you make a mistake. But that's how it's designed. It's meant to be a struggle and you're meant to lose sometimes. The great bit is that when we've lost, we've sometimes enjoyed the game more than when we won! Seriously, everything will seem to be going to plan and then you'll find something was missed. Someone moved the wrong way, someone didn't charge the reactor, someone miscalculated the health of the enemy. And that's when all you can do is laugh. It's a true co-operative, where everyone wins or everyone loses. 

The timing system is part of the beauty of the game. The non-tutorial missions will last 10 minutes exactly. Once the mp3 says "mission over", it's done. You go back and put your cards faceup and see what you actually did as you play through what actually happened. The playthrough only takes a few minutes and you find out whether you won/lost. And the playtime is a very intense 10 minutes. There's a lot of information coming out and co-ordination to do. You can't have an alpha player, because he has to trust in other people too. In fact, when we play - we always assign the captain role to the newest player in the group. The opposite of having an alpha player at the table! And we've found that works very well. With the optional scoring, the captain is the only person who scores points. At the same time, he's singularly responsible for failure!

In the main game, there's a lot of variability in difficulty and you can tailor it to your own group. There is a free app (android/itunes) available to give random missions beyond the mp3 cd provided, which allows you to tailor the difficulty more exactly. 

The hidden information/chaotic time pressure/requirement for involved co-op play/randomness of enemies/everything really makes this one of my favorite games - possibly the best co-operative game that I know of. I never refuse a game of this and actively suggest this in all my gaming groups - seeking more converts. While some people are intimidated by it, or aren't sure of the look of the game - everyone who's played it has enjoyed it and volunteered for another mission, or two, or three....

Can I highlight any negatives? Sure. Newer players must play the tutorial missions, so the experienced players will end up playing these missions quite a lot. Your group must have the right attitude for this game and be prepared to lose from time to time (as it will happen!). A quiet area is required, so playing in public requires space away from others - or you'll annoy them. But the positives so outweigh these tiny negatives.

Quite simply, an incredible game - and I can't wait to try out the expansion!

Frenético jogo real-time cooperativo. Tendo alguém para ler as cartas e prestar atenção na narração, fica fantástico. Desconfio que se for eu o responsável por isso, perderia um pouco da graça.

RATING: 8
My first ever ten I have given to a game. The reason for this is because it combines a strategy game with sheer laugh out loud fun. The atmosphere this game creates is amazing and unlike anything I have ever seen from a game. Plus the fact that the mechanics are simple but work together brilliantly, super impressive. Went down in rating after a couple of plays.

RATING: 7
(+) A 'real time' cooperative game, how original is that?!
(+) Great thematic feel: everyone is involved immediately
(+) Chaos and stress in the most funny way possible
(+) Everybody has a nice time learning the game thanks to the starting simulations offering a slowly increasing game difficulty and introducing the players to new concepts of the game

(-) Quite some set-up
(-) Don't try this with stress-irresistant friends!
(-) The Dutch soundtrack is bad beyond understanding. Download the English soundtrack!
(-) Due to the short nature of the game and the learning curve, it is difficult to come to the more interesting scenarios before the obligatory one participant who doesn't understand a thing of what is happening decides to stop playing. If a single player is not involved in the game it wil fail... epically...

RATING: 8
Of the cooperative games I've played, I like Space Alert best. The real time aspect diminishes the likelihood of quarterbacking, since the actions of four or five players would be too hard for one person to coordinate simultaneously. The pace also impresses a sense of urgency, something absent from turn-based cooperative games.

It's a fine real time game, but these are not really my thing, and I don't like having to reenact the whole thing again, after the hectic part is over. As a light real time gamer I prefer smething simpler like Escape, but I can definately see, why people would prefer this as it offers more depth.

It's like cooperative roborally with soundtrack and "storyline". Great fun!

Rulebook is so funny it's reason enough to buy this game. Beside the rulebook, it's a great game if you like logical "hack and slash" in space adventure. Soundtrack gives a feeling of a RTS and suspense, and makes the 30 mins per game a very enjoyable experience.

RATING: 6
Plays quickly, with each game taking about 30 minutes to play.  Can be a loud game with the soundtrack playing, but that is about 10 minutes only.  And that 10 minutes is plenty of time to get the perception of time pressure when in fact there really isn't that much (especially if one is familiar with the game.)  Once folks get familiar with teh game and accepting of the various roles needed to work together, not that difficult to defeat the challenges.  Of course, if someone has made a mistake, the plan goes pear-shaped and everyone hopes the damage isn't too bad.  Fun laughs for the short playing time.  Easy to play multiple sessions/missions in one sitting.

RATING: 9
Really fun co-op game. I like it a lot because it doesn't have the same negatives that other co-ops have (such as Pandemic). In Pandemic, one alpha player can control everyone elses actions and take over the game. This is not possible in Space Alert, it's too hectic... people need to be self reliant but still work as a team in order to succeed.

--May2009-- Very nice co-op. (And this from someone that isn't quite convinced that co-ops are always a Good Thing.)

I'm not sure how many plays are represented before I tire of the _Space Alert_ system, but at this point I'd be surprised if I burn out before 20.

I don't usually like frenzied games or co-ops, but Vlaada Chivatil makes them both work here.  This is further evidence of his being probably the most innovative designer out there today.  Really a lot of fun, though I'm concerned that the two CDs may limit re-play value a little.

Edit: The replay concerns were groundless, as the random selection of threats makes games very different, even when using the same track.

Wonderful game - you simply must play. I've played 10 times at least, and every sitting we end up playing at least twice. 

The game itself is worth it just for the experience - the rulebook alone sets the theme for the game and makes playing it first time a breeze, and I honestly do think the mechanics are well-thought out, if not exactly a masterpiece of mathematics like some games.

not very accessible) Narrative Co-op 

One of my faves. Takes a solid hour to explain the rules, though, or at least it has taken up to that long in the past. I love the bumbling chaos and the brutal and unforgiving nature of the game. Any game where everyone is standing up around the table yelling excitedly at each other for a solid ten minutes is a keeper.

I like playing the captain, natch. A strong leader does wonders toward orchestrating a win in this game. Or so I like to tell everyone!

Be the Captain and be bossy. Seems like good fun, but a little stressful for something to relax with after work. The fact is that in order to win the challenge you need to be efficient. In order to be efficient you need a leader. When you have a leader directing and coordinating then the challenges are far too easy.

The game would be far better served with some form of limited communication system between players - something like saying "ug" and "argh" and beating each other over the head with a blow up club when you fail to understand.

Nice idea overall though.

RATING: 8.5
This is one of the best examples of a "group-dependent" game - if you have (1) a dedicated group of 4-5 gamers who meets regularly, (2) who enjoy playing the same game across several meetings, and (3) enjoy puzzly real-time cooperative programming games, then this game is an absolutely fantastic experience!

Unfortunately, if your group doesn't meet all three of these requirements, then it simply won't work.

Why? Well, the game is complex enough (for a real time game) that you need to go through all simulations missions which will slowly add new elements and get the players used to all the mechanics within the game... and only after you played the game [b]eight[/b] times do you finally get a full grasp all the rules and are then ready to play the missions (the standard game) - diving in to the missions would overwhelm and confuse players to points of making the game unplayable.

As such, not having a group of people who meet regularly, want to play the same game several times to learn its nuances, and enjoy its peculiar style of game (which is indeed very peculiar - not many games are real time puzzles where players have to work together to program a complex solution) then the game simply can't take root.

But, my friend, if you are blessed with such a group - and I am fortunate to have one that fits the bill - this is a sublime experience. The synergy you experience as the 4 (or 5) of you try to plan together all our turns, finding the optimal way of dealing with a threat, coordinating threats simultaneously, deciding when to take a loss to stop a larger threat, reacting to unexpected events which cause you to reevaluate your plans, attempting to solve for miscalculations, stressing to verify that you accounted for everything - this is such a truly special experience.

My complaints are mainly conditional - (1) though the gameplay itself is relatively simple, the large number of things you have to consider in a short time span (10 minutes) makes it difficult to learn quickly (it needs to be slowly digested) which make it not a game one can easily introduce, (2) it seems obvious that the game would not be all that interesting with 1-3 players (I would never try it), and (3) some elements are slightly fiddly with its ample bookkeeping.

But if your group meets all 3 of those initial conditions, there there are virtual no complaints (aside from somewhat fiddly bookkeeping) - this is simply the best real time games out there aside from, perhaps, [b]Captain Sonar[/b] - but if I have 4-5 players only, I will be reaching for this one anyway as that serves the 6+ crowd.

Rating is currently at a reserved and cautious 8.5, but I expect it may peak at a 9 eventually.

The game ended up being more frustrating than fun. Resolving the jump could be very fiddly at times, and that part was actually quite boring.  Unlike Galaxy Trucker, there was no sense of amusement as things went wrong.  When someone made a wrong move in Space Alert that screwed everything up, you just had the sense of "Well, that was a waste now."

Another similarity: RoboRally.  When you mess up a card in RoboRally, it can still be very amusing and you get to program your robot again 45 seconds later.  Much more fun.

Real-time team panic in a space ship. Very original mechanics, great replay value and multiple ways to win. Other players can be as big obstacles for the ship's survival as the actual threats are. Not for people with analysis paralysis and who don't like shouting.

I was really disappointed in this game.  It looked as though it were going to be a clever combination of Roborally and Space Dealer in a cooperative game.  Well, it is a combination.  However, it seems to have a strong tendency to fall prey to one person being the leader and directing everyone else.  That is a really bad thing in general for a cooperative game.  the other big problem seems to be that it is hard enough to communicate without the game making it more difficult, which is part of the game.  In fact, it seems like to really get the most out of this game, you would need to play it multiple times.  At this point, I jsut can't see that happening.  It doesn't help that the CD is a royal pain.  Overall, I would play if asked, but I won't ever seek it out. [11/26/2008]

Excellent game of dealing with stressful situations in real time with the added bonus that if you loose you don't really die, its just a game.
Threats come in real-time and everyone has to control their characters and coordinate with others to deal with the threats placing what movements and actions they will do at time corresponding to the threats.
After the entire time has elapsed, you go through the entrance of each enemy and each players planned actions to see whether the enemies were correctly dealt with. Usually lots of hilarity ensues after discovering someone went left instead of right or forgot to do 'computer maintenance' etc.

Excellent game, I've never played anything else like it.

2014 UPDATE: 9. Wish I could get this game out more, all I seem to do is play the first few tutorial levels, we've never really gotten beyond that. :/

Excellent example of a real-time board game.

Not as other cooperative games. You have to trust your teammates, and there is not enough time to plan it for just one person (assuming you are not playing solo variant that is).

Be careful though, it's a demanding one, most of the time you are under stress.

Battlestations in COOP mode!!

This game is a crazy hoot to play. The setting: a spaceship that is scanning the area that it has warped into. Players listen to a series of prerecorded alert sounds that trigger off events. They then program a hand of cards (ala roborally) in order to deal with the threats. This includes moving around, firing weapons, powering weapons etc.

Once the 10 minute soundtrack finishes, players then resolve all the threats and programmed cards. This is where the fun begins. Erroneous and uncoordinated programming, ship damage etc all add to the tension and agony as players see if they manage to survive the threats.

Great looking components. Fairly easy turn structure. Quickish game. Lots of replaybility. Pity it's so hard to find in English! CZG had a hit with Galaxy Trucker last year and they someone manage to top that this year! Well done.

Another co-operative type game, and another low rating.

Some of the problems with this game are the usual co-operative game problems (insufficiently complex choices, too predictable); other problems are unique to this game (anti-climactic resolution, very little flavour).

The art is well done, though.  Enough to bump it up a little.

Feels like an unfunny sitcom.  I know the reactions the game is going for, but they just aren't there. This is seriously a top-100 game?  I don't get it.

Lots of fun, as long as no one takes it too seriously -- it's easy to get blown up because of one mistake.  Time pressure adds a layer of intensity to the game that's quite addictive.  Cooperative, and you must rely on your teammates assurances that they're dealing with something -- you don't have time to double guess them while dealing with your own tasks.
Includes a pleasing solitaire variation where you have all the action cards at your disposal and 4 "androids" to play for in addition to your own activities.  Communication and coordination are no longer a factor, but the decision-making is cranked to 500 percent.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Great real-time co-op strategy game, though it takes several turns to learn all the tricks. Hard to win with too many inexperienced players, and with communication remaining a bottleneck even among experienced players.

Takes exactly 12 minutes, and the two main questions during the resolving afterwards are in which turn everything gets chaotic and whether you are lucky enough to still survive.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fairly complex, but really fun. Unlike a lot of other co-op games, you usually lose and when you lose it's pretty funny. When you actually win feels SO satisfying because it is NOT EASY TO DO.

I'll admit I haven't played it a ton. It's hard to find people who are willing to learn a fairly rule-heavy game, especially since it's played very fast and with a game clock/narrator.

GREAT theme. Hard to believe it was designed by the same guy who designed Codenames.

I have played maybe 6 games with 2 different groups.  So we have not made it through all the introduction missions, thus we haven't been playing with everything yet.  

So far though I really enjoy it.  I was worried it would become a cooperation where the leader took over the game.  We only had that issue on the early introduction missions.  Once more enemies started appearing we had to split up and work in different teams which I really enjoyed.

You need the right group for this though, this is definitely not a game for everyone.  I know some people who don't like the tension the game brings.  Others just were not good at coordinating and grew to dislike the game.

RATING: 9
Exudes fun. Easily the best co-op I have played. It creates experiences that you simply don't get in other games. I remember waiting for the mission to start actually being nervous I was going to foul it up. Then there was a flurry of activity for ten minutes and at the end I had to breathe a sigh of relief. Just superb.

Galaxis roncsderbi és Roborally szerelemgyereke a Space Alert Pandemic kooperációval vegyítve. Egyedi megoldás, hogy az űrjáték CD-vel vezérelt. Egy géphang közli mi történik körülöttünk az űrben, illetve miket csinálhatunk. Némi nyelvtudást igényel, de nem vészes. Űrhajósainkkal a 3x2 részre osztott űrhajónkban tevékenykedünk. Minden teremben több feladatot elvégezhetünk, ezt a Roborally-hoz hasonlóan kártyákkal kell jeleznünk egy idővonalon. A második nehézségen ez 12 lap lerakását jelenti, majd a CD végighallgatása közben. Kb. 5 perc és utána végrehajtjuk a kártyák és ellenséges űrhajók, aszteroidák tevékenységét sorban. Nagy bátran a 3. szinttel próbáltuk kezdeni, de végül a 2-es nehézséget választottuk. Három játékból nem sikerült megmentenünk egyszer sem az űrhajónkat. Nagyon nehéznek tűnik a játék, nagy összeszokottság kell a jó játékhoz, de legalább van bőven kihívás. El sem tudom képzelni az ötödik szint mennyire kilátástalan lehet. A játék rettentő gyors. Fél óra alatt lejátszható egy parti. Egyszerűek a szabályok, logikus a játékmenet. Egyetlen hibának a játékosszámfüggését érzem. Hárman még nem az igazi. Négyen már biztosan jobb és talán öten lehet a legélvezetesebb. Akinek a Galaxis roncsderbi és Roborally tetszett és szereti a kooperációs játékokat az biztosan élvezni fogja a Space Alertet. Egy 7-essel indítok pontban, de még nőhet ha tényleg jobb lesz a játék négyen-öten kipróbálva.

A unique co-op experience... I much prefer playing against humans rather than a system, so lack of humans to compete against isn't my style... but Space Alert does better for me than most co-ops because the human element is very real. You might not have to crush the other players, but you still must consider them and their psychology to do well on the harder difficulties, and the teamwork element is real (this isn't a solo game)

But still, a co-op. Very clever game, puzzley yet humorous, but not having an opponent makes me quite indifferent about winning/losing, which sucks the tension out for me -- which is also cool cause this game is funny and part of the fun sometimes is to laugh at your defeat (like Galaxy Trucker), but this is one I appreciate more than I enjoy.

I should first mention that I like Coops, realtime games, and enjoy many preprogrammed games, I also am dying for a great Sci-fi game.  This seemed like a no brainer to me. I won't deny that fans of pre-programming games will probably get a kick out of this.  Lots of logistics to deal with.  This is all about coordination.  But it is this coordination that ultimately makes the game fail for me (though there are other factors as well).  In order to effectively muscle through this it is best to set up a captain that knows the system.  He makes all the decisions, everyone follows orders.  Then what is there for me to do...?

The timing compels the game so that you aren't overly min-maxing, but a good captian will piece together the easy logistics of it all.  Despite the time pressure, I never felt an overwhelming sense of urgency or tension.

It is cool to see the way it plays out in the end, but in some ways it reminds me more of Light Speed where you have the game playing phase and the scoring phase.  Because these elements of play and results are so heavily separated, I ended up feeling a bit bored about halfway through the results phase.  To me this feels like a test where you wait for your paper to come back to find out the results.

There are times in the game where there just isn't much you can do, and you feel like you are waiting around for something to happen.  This tightens up more as you play the more advanced scenarios.  But, when you've made your decisions, it is back to waiting again.

Thematically, it is great.  I love the specific damage.  I love the robots fighting the internal struggle.  Coordinating the power supply is entertaining.  It really works as a fun sim and as a great experience.  It is great to watch it unfold.

It is best to set up a poor communicator as the captain.  A good captain will make it too easy, a bad one will make it more difficult.

Honestly, the most fun thing about this game is pretending that there are interoffice politics.  "Oh, you're gonna get written up for that", "Thanks for the assist, I'll put it in the report", "Do you know how much that's going to cost the company?" 

That said, I just wish it were actually exciting.  It isn't necessary, but I'll occasionally play other people's copies.

I should also should mention that the CD is really annoying.  I find it difficult to understand what is being said sometimes; especially when players are talking to each other, trying to figure out should be done.

A timed cooperative game with an interesting application of the Robo-Rally movement mechanism.  This game is probably best for a dedicated group who is committed to learning the rules, since there are an awful lot of rules to learn.  On the other hand, it is a special sort of fun to watch when one person zigs when he should have zagged, often with hilariously catastrophic results.

It's like Galaxy Trucker in 3-D.  I think it's an exercise in teamwork, where you must develop a kind of shorthand communication with the other players, while learning to ignore the non-essential sounds of the CD.  Pluses:  it's pretty quick, and presents an interesting real-time puzzle.  Minuses:  the speed aspect and variety of enemies will lead to chaos in most games, which I don't find particularly fun.  Also, even though the program is only 10 minutes long, it takes another 15-20 minutes to do the post-mortem.  I dunno.  It seems fun, and I approached it with an open mind, but I didn't fall in love with it.

Update: Starting to grow on me. Raised rating from 6 to 7.

This real-time, multimedia cooperative game is actually kind of fun! It's pretty challenging, though, but I think we might have to get our own copy.

Introducing all the actions and elements of the game would never work for new players but at the same time, for people like me who have only a weekly game group that not all members show up to all the time, having to play through the training missions over and over again to get everyone to that level isn't the most interesting either.

Also, this game is unforgiving to mistakes, especially early mistakes.  Enter the wrong room or play the wrong action early and everything else can just be a spiral into defeat.  The tripping mechanic is there to alleviate this but delaying all your actions a turn can be just as punishing.  Perhaps my group just hasn't figured out the right strategy, our first games were kind of hectic with everyone running everywhere trying to do everything.  Perhaps we need to stay put and man a station to be more effective.

Losing a game SHOULDN'T be so bad though because the whole game post-setup and teaching should only take 15-20 minutes (10 minutes for the soundtrack and 5-10 to play everything out...even shorter if you lose early).  But I've noticed that after a brutal loss it's hard to get people excited in another go, maybe I need to push for that harder though.  Especially since the game has such a long setup, doing all that for one 15-20 minute play can get irritating.

I'll have to reevaluate this game once everyone is a little more experienced, this is not a forgiving game for beginners but I can see how it could be very rewarding once everyone is a little more experienced and talented at it and all the elements are there to play with.  Especially since you can get several plays in in the time it would take to play most other cooperative games.

It seems fun. Cooperative games are a bit weird to me because I don't have a responsability feeling of what I'm doing but I guess that's the fun part of it.
I've only made the "test drive" so far so I really have to try a real mission to have a solid opinion about this game.

I don't like the artwork very much.

4-player game on holiday was good fun (apart from one crewmember who was nodding off during the mission! - no names mentioned, but that stealth fighter shouldn't have got through!); need to play again soon!

Rule book (or rather "training manual") should get a special mention - all rules should be done like this!

I can see why some people would enjoy it, but the real-time gameplay is extremely stressful and unpleasant for me. Then you spend half the game just watching the game resolve itself, which is boring and decision-free. There wasn't a single moment of the game when I enjoyed myself.

RATING: 7.15
A nice game which can be fun and thrilling.  

I play boardgames to wind down and relax. That is not 
possible with this game.  

The other thing is that it's to difficult to bring new players to unless you play the first missions again. 
Which for an experienced player is rather tedious. 
Unless he instructs other players what to do, which ruins
a bit of their fun. 

Other then that, a fun game.

Most game soundtracks are just too corny and I had a hard time getting over that when this game was recommended, however after taking the plunge I can say that the way it conducts the game makes an experience like no other. Timing constraints are really the only way to have a good co-op game that isn't just an overblown solitaire game. Fantastic game.

-----------------

Played only once, the first training mission. Played at a con, where the rules explanation was short and somewhat chaotic. So we didn't have the slightest idea what we were doing. And still won.
One short training session is not enough to get an impression, so I'm withholding my rating for now. But I suspect that I may find this too chaotic. And I'm not too fond of the way you plan your moves in a Robo Rally-like manner: one mess-up and you're screwed.
But then, I like SciFi and co-ops, so there is hope yet.

Exciting new game, were really playing it hard for a while.  We havent beaten a mission yet when using all the hardest enemies, so the expansion will not be needed yet.
The only problem is that it's INTENSE, and often I can't get it out because I want to have a drink and have a relaxing game evening.  The stress of the game isn't great for those of us that work full time and have kids, and thus have limited energy.

Very rarely in the history of board gaming does one come across a game that is truly very unique, and this is one of those rare gems.  Sure, it could be described as a cross between "RoboRally", "Pandemic", and "Galaxy Trucker", yet this game brings something altogether different to the table - a hectic, "real time" game of co-operation and destructive mayhem!  Mind you, at the risk of sounding completely arrogant, I was surprised by how easy this game was.  Playing with 4 experienced and intelligent gamers who communicate very well with each other, it's apparently possible to beat the full missions after only a few training runs.  Okay, it's not "easy", but threads I had read lead me to believe that this game was super-hard.  The production quality of the game is excellent, with my biggest complaint being that nerve gratingly annoying computer voice.  I would have much rather had a soothing female voice, and perhaps some background sound effects of computers beeping, lasers pewing, and footsteps running in between the speaking bits.  Other than that, I have to give big props to the brilliant designer of this truly unique game!  Unfortunately for my wallet, this is one that has some serious expansion potential...  Game design: 4.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 4/5  Total: 8.5/10

RATING: 8
Has to be a 9 because it's so, so good at doing what it does. Space Alert is the dream of RoboRally: tense, pre-programmed movement that's satisfying when it works and perhaps even more satisfying when it doesn't. It is the dream of Pandemic: you are all working together, but you can [i]feel[/i] events spiralling out of control -- and you can't take a breather to think things through or talk it out because the turn has to end in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1...

It's an amazing design and a fantastic, intense experience that must be tried at least once. That said, while losing horribly once is hilarious, I'm not sure that it will be as fun the tenth time. It's just punishing: one mistake can cost you the game, and communication is both critical and very difficult -- we had problems with everyone talking at once.  

The upside is that the time pressure keeps play time short enough that it's quite addictive. It also tends to alleviate Pandemic's "bully problem" because it simply isn't possible for one player to micromanage the whole crew.

Not like any game I own, but a brilliant example of what board games can be.

RATING: 10
This game is amazing.  I love it.  It's so frantic.  And it's the best thing ever when it turns out everyone coordinated way better than you were expecting!  It's still pretty tough to get used to dealing with some of the internal threats (we've played like 5 or 6 times now, but only a few times with internal threats).  I think the worst part is having to deal with trying to teach new players.  It's really frustrating because they don't know what's happening or how to get involved.  But with a group that knows what's up, this game is AMAZING.  It's like I'm really on a space ship ;)

One of the most innovative games I've played in a long time.  Making a real-time co-op solves all the complains of "solved" games where an alpha player can control it by themself; there is far too much chaos and uncertainty here for one person to possibly direct all the other crew members exactly.  Everyone needs to be on the ball and engaging; the table is filled with screaming, pointing fingers, and confusion (at least until communications go down :devil: ). The resolution phase is met with groans of dawning comprehension, laughter, and (hopefully) cheers and hi-fives.  A game this exciting and emotionally engaging deserves a 10, particularly when it only takes a half hour.  The only qualm is getting a regular group together to play; otherwise, you'll be running a lot of training missions for the benefit of newbies.

You're going to make me cooperate *and* put me under timed pressure? One or the other, please. And preferrably, neither.

Really just not a good combination for me, personally. Not something I'm likely to play often. And when I do play it I'll have no better option than just to do whatever I'm told to do by the folks who've played it alot. Otherwise, I'm just being a ninny. 

On the other hand, if you enjoy coops and being under a time limit doesn't set your nerves on edge, this could be the game for you. In many other coops, it's possible that the "deck" can be heavily stacked against you before the game even starts. In Space Alert, there's the feeling that if you can just keep your cool, there's a solution for just about any predicament.

The best part of the game is watching the sequence of events play out after-the-fact.

'5' indicates the level of enjoyment I had with the game. If you enjoy this sort of thing, it could be way up there for you.

It's a cooperative game with no traitor or anything like that. It is fun especially the first training mission. It definitely works as a game but once a group has got their act together it could become a little repetitive.

Having played it a second time, it definitely for me has a limited re playability factor, the missions are only slightly different and the actions of the players equally so.

This is a fun game with the right players in the right mood and also the first time you play it.

Full of chaos and mayhem.  The mix of real time and planning is a great blend for a cooperative game; you need to work with the other players, but its very frantic and hard to coordinate perfectly.  Much more fun with 5 players; the extra chaos of trying to coordinate 5 people and the extra danger of more threats adds to the game.  Found it too dull with 2 players, but that was before we started mixing in the advanced threat cards, which spices it up a bit.  Still not as good as with 5p though. We're now having problems playing with new players; with an all experienced group we play with more threats, but with some new players mixed in its too  hard to keep it a good challenge level.

Potential to move up or down. On the plus side, it is outstandingly short. However, it's very difficult to explain to new players without spending a good hour or so in the training missions.

A brilliantly original game. The mission CDs, which are very well produced, provide a great deal of frantic decision making. It's actually harder to co-ordinate tactics with the more players that are participating in the game as any strategy you seem to adopt as a team often falls by the wayside as the game progresses. I guess good communication under pressure between players is the key to being successful at this game. The game also provides a large amount of variety due to the combinations provided by the different missions, threats, actions cards etc available. The originality and variety make this one of the best co-operative games available.

Fun highly depends on who you play it with, and how good your grasp of the rules. Fun idea, game is ok and definitely see the potential of greatness with the right group. For me, it's comparable to RoboRally (program first, execute later) but as a group. And I prefer Roborally actually, as you only have yourself to blame :)

On the other hand, a team success is much sweeter, so perhaps this game gets better the more you play (we got killed all the time).

Plays well with three players. I have yet to play with more. Ineptitude has rarely been this much fun. I would not worry if you are unable to consistently find four players. The official three player variant works very well and works for first time players.

The components are excellent, the rulebook is cheesy yet entertaining, and the game plays incredibly quickly once you get the rules down. I did not, however, find it helpful to read the handbook aloud for my play group. The pacing of the rules introductions in the handbook was a bit too slow, and not quite in the right order for my group's sensibilities. However, as I found it very entertaining when I read it the first time, I would still recommend starting with the handbook and going for a straight rules explanation if it feels too slow.

This is certainly a game you want to research and learn ahead of your first play session to make sure things run smoothly and efficiently as the explanation of the rules can be a while and the game plays in a rather unusual manner.

The startup learning curve of new ensigs is a bit rough on this game but after one or two rounds (which goes really quick) most people is up to speed on the general idea of the game.
You could easily play 4-8 games during a gaming session and still want more.
There are roosters and acheivenemts included in the new frontier which when you get a couple of games under your belt will enhance your experience as a seasoned crew.
Best played with gamers that have already had a couple of games with Space Alert.

I think I really like this game.  We tried it twice, but we lost horribly.  I think we should have started by running through the tutorial missions, but we tried to jump right into the hard missions.  We had not really gotten the hang of working together yet and we were plunged into mayhem.

Sort of like kids running the Enterprise or something.

In any case, I want to go back through the training missions and build our crew up to battling the real enemies.

This is the game that made us realise that real time tabletop games are not for us. Otherwise the game provides a formidable challenge - we only made it out from trouble half the time. The other thing that was a miss for us is the artwork which was not evocative for us at all (some of us called it even ugly). While the adrenaline rush and time pressure can be appealing to many it did not really work out for us. The game still gets a 6 because it is mostly our fault not the game's.

RATING: 7
A lot of cool variables at play here. Complicated but always logical and not too difficult to comprehend, though very hard to succeed. (I wish the combat was this clean in Mage Knight, a good game by the same designer, Vlaada Chvatil).  Perhaps the color coordination of meeples should be different from the zones--at least this might help figuring things in the crazy (and somewhat dubious) solo variant--but this is a satisfying and frenzied game that seems like a bonkers confluence of Galaxy Trucker and Robo Rally shot through with a espresso.

‘Space Alert‘, otro juego colaborativo en el que los jugadores deben explorar peligrosos sectores de la galaxia en pequeñas naves. Las misiones duran diez minutos: salto al hiperespacio, escanear el sector, y vuelta al hiperespacio, y lo único que deben lograr es proteger la nave durante el proceso. En un CD se incluyen bandas sonoras de diez minutos que representan los avisos del ordenador central sobre la presencia de amenazas: naves de combate, monstruos interestelares, asteroides, intrusos o averías en la nave… Los jugadores deben decidir quién realizará cada tarea necesaria y coordinarán sus acciones en tiempo real para salir del atolladero. Ofrece varios niveles de dificultad, es muy rejugable, y ofrece una experiencia nunca vista hasta ahora. Cada partida dura unos 30 minutos en total.

28-Nov-08: Plays within 30 mins? Check. Fun? Check. Innovative? Check (or rather Czech! ;)) This game is a unique offering that packs a lot of fun into only 30 mins per mission. We played 3 missions consecutively. Although confusing at first (in our first mission, we didn't even know what we were doing!), it gradually dawned on us. This game almost demands that everyone know precisely what everyone else is doing, because actions that one person takes can jeopardise the whole game! Definately a thumbs up for pure gaming fun!

Sort of a hard game to review after one play, but based on that play I have mixed feelings about this title.  I found the whole first half of the game to be a little obnoxious, where as I found the second half of the game to be a total blast.  The damage system was actually quite inspired and interesting, the fall out of the events was a ton of fun to watch.  It's a rare sort of game that lingers in your memory afterward, while it might have been frustrating playing it, the fall out ends up being very memorable.  Pure fun if you can suffer through the games more annoying aspects.

It's a nice game with a new concept. Sadly it suffers more than most coop games from "bossing" the other players. If you want to succeed, you actualy need someone who tells people what to do - there is not much time to discuss things. Also the soundtrack is a bit problematic, because the distorted voice on the english soundtrack is hard to understand sometimes.
Still a good game - but I believe that there are better coop-games.

This game has the worst written rules I have ever seen ship in a board game.  It took us about 3 hours to figure out how to play.  When we finally "got it", the game was fun but not so fun I'd want to play again.  The various things you can do don't seem very well balanced.  Shoot everything with guns and make sure you don't run out of energy -- couldn't figure out a good reason to recharge your shields -- you're almost always better off just shooting.  Very difficult to remember the range of different things and the board isn't helpful in this regard.

Outstanding.  The environment and theme are just great, and I like the artwork and the whimsical way the game presents itself.  The reactions when you turn over the cards and realize someone that was supposed to move left actually moved right, or when you see you did one less point of damage than you expected, are great.  It was, however, a little annoying at BGG.con to have the rooms filled with speakers playing the CD :)

A strange combination of RoboRally, Galaxy Trucker, a co-op, and a CD giving you instructions. The CD gives you alerts which allow you to plan out your moves with the other players. At the end of the session, everyone plays out their orders and if your ship survived the mission, you win and get a score.

Played 4 times (Tutorial 1 twice, Tutorial 2 once and Simulated Mission 1) with 5 and 4 players. This game is so different from any other game out there. The real time aspect is very difficult to get a handle on for the first couple games. By the time we played the Simulated Mission, we had a better hang of it, but the communication to succeed was still not there. Very fun, but stressful game. Probably plays best with 4 or 5, but I'm interested in trying it with other numbers as well.

The first problem with Space Alert is that it takes about 2 hours of uncomfortable training before the interesting bits start to come out.  After that, it's more of a novelty:  rush to program events for 10 minutes and then spend half an hour unwinding them.  "Let's see how we did!"  That said, it's intensely creative and feels like a true labor of love.

RATING: 7
High pressure, intense co-op game. Watch out for players who like to dominate play in these types of games, but if you can avoid that issue, it's great fun. Study up on the turn resolution rules after the mission... going through that resolution super fast is the key here.

Greatly enjoying this experience. It is something very different and in terms of interaction among the champions of that category. 

You can hardly say it about games these days, but this one's just unique. 

- 1 overall due to practical reasons. This is a game you have to play with the same gamer crew, so you can build up on the experience. Every time you play with newbies you will have to or let's say you should start with the first testruns and the simulated missions. Which might get quite annoying for the gamemaster, if he is to play with gamers new to this game every time. Personally, I can see myself struggling to go through the testruns again as I am eager to continue with the further simulations and the missions.  Which I wasn't able of doing yet, because my 3 x 3 sessions of this game was with players new to the game each time.

Finally got to play the advanced simulations and the game is (and always was) a truly unique design. There is nothing like it.

Protecting your scout ship from invaders, natural dangers, enemy ships, and traitorous saboteurs all in real time. Difficult coordination of player actions to manage energy, weapons and shields, battle bots, rockets, and fighters.

RATING: 7
Projecting my long range opinion of this game is impossible.  Either endlessly annoying, stressful, and unbearably chaotic or loud, stressful, confusing and entertaining.  This is the poster child of a game that could really be ruined or made by who you play it with.  

But, regardless of what I (or anyone) thinks about the game itself, it is clear that, coupled with Galaxy Trucker, Vlaada Chvatil has solidified himself as a designer that truly cares about creating games that are fun (in the purest sense of the word) to play.

Space Alert is a lot of fun.  The only thing holding it back is the learning curve and finding a group of people who are willing to learn and play regularly enough that they don't need to be retaught the rules every time.  The idea of having to reteach the game over and over is a bit daunting.

Can't wait to play this one when I get it...somehow. I'm sure it will be a riot.

UPDATE
I've played it several times now and I was right. It is a riot. Unfortunately I have a hard time convincing people to play it with me. And it's quite a long effort to get people into the full rules that I rarely get people to that point. It's a hard reality, but I've been thinking of selling/trading it off lately. It would truly be a sad day for me, but in the end, if it doesn't get played, it should probably go. :(

This is the programmed action game I've been looking for.

It's a Vlaada game through and through, and I love that they use the same art style as Space Alert. The instructions are laugh-out-loud funny and crafted in a way that you can dive right in as it layers on the mechanics.

My only gripe is the lack of a mobile app. The game would feel a bit more dynamic if the missions were truly randomly generated, rather than choosing from a list of predefined MP3s.

A very, very interesting and novel take on a co-op game.  Adding real time as a constraint solves many of the 'traditional' co-op problems.  However, at the end of the day, the scenarios seem almost too 'simple' to me, and I'm not sure how long it will hold my interest past the novelty stages.

RATING: 10
I could describe this amazing game as a highly thematic cooperative puzzle game with a timer. But that's like describing a beautiful woman as a pile of bones & flesh in an attractive setup.

Space alert works and rocks. It's unplayable at crowded places and requires at least one dedicated player initialy(think dm for rpgs, but only for the first 5-6 games). You'll also want to play again and again but you'll quickly find out that space crusading for 2+ hours (4-5 games) is an extremely exhausting experience. End of bad points. Go find the good ones yourselves, it's worth it.

Well done Mr Chvatil.

I have a special fondness for co-op games, and this one is probably the most unique one out there right now.  Ridiculously fun, with a rulebook that's as much fun to read as the game is to play.

Based on Shut Up and Sit Down's review of it, I want to give the game the benefit of the doubt, but I just felt like the game is confusing and luck driven. It throws too much information at players with no way to process it all. It was not overwhelming, it was so much that I could not even start to process it, so I did not. I was too busy trying to make use of a hand that was almost entirely "go up in the elevator" and "hit A button".

RATING: 9
Chaos in a box.  Its fun, even though we were terrible at it.  It truly is galaxy trucker and robo rally put into a blender, add additional chaos, and there you go.  I like it, and I may ultimately love it, but I think once I get past the curve of figuring out the system it will be a fun experience but not a regular go to game.  This game makes me hate the people I game with.  I kid I kid, but the one player would set down all 13 of his cards before the phase 1 part of the cd was over.  I guess he just "needed" battlebots and shooting the front guns.  Haha, but its short, fun, interactive and variable.  It holds up well, I have become better as has the group and its a pretty good time.  It may be time to start keeping score and looking out the window.

The biggest issue with this game is it is both a "love it or hate it" game, and it shines with a higher player count.  This means it is difficult to get to the table as much as I'd like.

Space Alert is another cooperative game that I played three times in November, but contrasts with Ghost Stories because Space Alert is actually a game that I had been eagerly looking forward to trying. It also contrasts with Ghost Stories because it was somewhat disappointing and not a game that I intend to purchase. I think that Vlaada Chvatil is one of the most promising board game designers out there, but didn’t particularly care for his newest offering. My favorite Chvatil game is certainly Galaxy Trucker, including its Rough Road Ahead expansion and The Big Expansion, but I’ve enjoyed the experiences of trying his diverse offerings, from Prophecy to Through the Ages: A Story of Civilization, and now Space Alert. Unlike other promising designers such as Mac Gerdts, Vlaada manages to create an amazingly diverse assortment of games (and while I enjoy Gerdts’ designs, and Imperial was my favorite new game of 2006, I did breathe a sigh of relief when I heard he’d finally abandoned the Rondel in his newest game Princes of Machu Picchu, although there are whisperings that the Rondel is simply hidden in Princes, but I have yet to try it to see for myself). Back to the subject at hand, Space Alert is a fun romp that will inevitably be compared to Space Dealer by many since both games use a CD soundtrack to narrate the game experience. It’s amusing and I’m glad I tried it, but the decision-making just doesn’t measure up to something like Ghost Stories. The actions to choose between are to move left/right/up/down or to push a button A, B, or C. The players certainly have to work together to make sure their actions are timed well together, but you don’t have the same sort of intricate combinations and possibilities that you do in Ghost Stories. You’re forced to spend many of your twelve actions doing nothing if your cards don’t cooperate or to sit in the same room pushing the same button over and over. It’s an experience game and one that’s well worth experiencing, but not one that I want to keep playing, unlike Vlaada’s Galaxy Trucker, which I’ve played 20 times now.

Space Alert is definitely interesting, and is a fun co-op experience.  The audio CD offers a very cool mechanic which adds quite a bit to the overall experience.

The game sort of plays like Pandemic crossed with Robo Rally... that is the best way to describe it.  If you like Pandemic, you will love this game, as they are both "us against the threat" kind of games which involve maximizing your response to danger.

I felt like the game was very tactical, but didn't offer a ton of choice... it seemed to be playing itself a bit towards the end.  It was fun, but I can't really see myself getting pulled in too much.

Sure, [thing=38453][/thing] isn't a new game, not even a obscure one that I haven't heard anything about it until now. It so happens that I read a lot regarding [thing=38453][/thing] and the game has been in a on/off relationship with my shopping cart for as long as I can remember.

Why the on?
- Well, I really enjoy [b]cooperative[/b] games. They are my favorite kind of game! O know that I'm a competitive person, and I always play to win when the game requires. But I prefer to beat a game than a person. I like to work together with my friends, and prefer this to burn my brain against them - they are tough to beat! And [thing=38453][/thing] meets this? Yes;
- I also like [b]short games[/b]. I don't mean games with nothing on the bones, but games that give you meaningful choices, that requires smart play, that is [b]fun[/b] to play, all in a tight package. I'm fortune to have found some of these along my gaming quests. And [thing=38453][/thing] meets this? Yes, really well, by the way.

Why not?
- The [b]soundtrack[/b]. I usually play with my gaming group - this means more than one game happening at a time. A loud game, that demands not only a lot of table talk ("Will anyone activates the shields? Do we have enough energy for two shots? An elevator card, do you have one?") but also the need to listen to a soundtrack in English (a minor problem for a lot of you, a great deal of a problem for many of us. I consider myself a good - not great - listener for English words, but with the need to talk with the other players and listen to the soundtrack, I lose a lot of information, specially if the volume isn't high), isn't a great match for multiple gaming tables - anyone playing [thing=38453][/thing] would surely get in the way of the others. I know there is a way to play without the soundtrack, but it feels weird, not within the theme and also requires one player to be the "announcer" - I want everyone involved to play!;
- The [b]frantic play[/b]. I don't mind at all. Many won't also. But there are those that do - players that wants to relax while playing, to take the mind of the everyday rush and have time to ponder about things. In some friday nights, I can even become one of them. I know people that can't handle [thing=16986][/thing]!

These were the considerations I made before I played the game and they all stand now, after I played. [thing=38453][/thing] isn't a game for all, and I guess that even for those that like it, they wouldn't play it everytime they got the chance.

The manual is a blast to read, really fun and useful. The tutorial scenario is a good way to teach players. When we take a step further, we could understand the changes and the added difficulty.

After playing it, would I buy it? Probably not (but, who knows? I did enjoyed it quite a bit), but I'm glad that someone did!

RATING: 9
The way everyone's working together playing an important role, with so much to worry about and the harsh penalties for messing up... it's just fantastic. With a good crew, this makes for a wonderful experience. The best games of this involve an intense countdown, with destroyed plans, hoping that the rockets will hit SOMEthing, seeing the damage token being the one that will ruin everything... and if we somehow make it through alive, it's a miracle to be praised. The adjustable missions make it so you can train a new crew or start hitting stuff head-on. Training and playing in general isn't a very easy feat, but with an experienced crew it's tough to beat.

The expansion makes this all the more addictive, with rewards for victory beyond just winning. As experienced as we are (I've played over 100 times personally) we're still losing far too often, so we've barely touched the red threats yet, but we still love the specializations, the double actions, and of course the badges.

This is not a game.

I'm sure I'm wrong about this, too many folks I respect love it, and I get it's designed for lunacy. I may be alergic to the metaphor in charge, the recursive iterations of programming vs meatspace slapstick and an eggtimer. This felt like the constant retelling of the same joke.

But, I was sober when I played, which is tragic.

Beautiful components.  Great idea.  Immersive theme.  Too bad the gameplay doesn't hold up.  A lot of people around here poo-poo Killer Bunnies because it's too random & luck-based.  If any of those folks give this a relatively higher rating, I'll know to disount their opinions entirely as the rantings of bits (neat-o disaster tiles & trippy cd) whores.  

This is infuriatingly random: spending 10 fun/frantic minutes planning, knowing that all those plans can be made irrelevant with one fateful card shift is not my idea of grown-up gaming (though I'll grant that D&D-playing kids might like it). Five veteran gamers around the table agreed: Space Alert has far too much randomness to be called a strategy game.

Very original. Really proves how well (or badly) you work together (and how effectively you communicate) under time pressure. Quite funny when you finally see the results of your efforts. Still, you will need some perseverance and dedication to go through the training sessions, and that might nog be everybody's cup of tea. Also, (as with most co-op games) I have some doubts on how long the concept will stay fresh enough to ensure replayability.

This is one of the most enjoyable and refreshing board game experiences to date. I love how this shakes up the co-operative genre up by making it impossible for a player to tell everyone else what to do. Even if such a player exists in the group, make them the captain! 

There's been some really funny moments including people moving up and down elevators (for no reason) and someone saying mid-game 'I don't even know where I am...'.. wait, that was me. 

Fun times! :meeple:

Suffering from the same problem his other videogame-as-boardgames do, the bookkeeping normally handled by the computer is offloaded onto the players in a protracted resolution phase.

This one is a better experience than the others though, in part because the resolution time doesn't actually exceed the decision-making time.  On top of that, there's a lot to be said for the time pressure and hectic-ness of this game, which is a particularly good thing in a co-op.

Holy crap, I love this game.  It's quick, it's intense, and it's unique.

RATING: N/A
I've gotten as far as reading the intro instructions and see that it would be a control freak's paradise.  The mechanic is a little odd.  You have an action round where you listen to a recording of incoming threats.  The players use cards similar in theme to Robo Rally that defines a spaceships crews' movement and actions in response to the threats.  Actions include manning shields, laser cannons, and power distribution & generation.  You have 7-10 real-time minutes to plan things during the action round.  After that completes, you move on to the resolution round.  The board is completely reset and you see how well you planned things out.  It's the separation of the action and resolution round that seems a bit wonky.

The control freak part I mentioned is in regards to having an overall plan to handle the events as they come in.  You need a captain that helps direct the actions of other players -- but given resource allocation, current board status and variations of incoming threats, they would need to delegate some of that responsibility or have a really keen mind to keep it all under control.

Looks fun though.

A fun space themed co-op game with interesting mechanics.  Reminiscent of Galaxy Trucker by the same designer, but this time a co-op.

Quick game.  Not everyone is going to like it.  The game really revolves around teamwork and reminds me of the "team building" activities you see at management and team seminars.  Details are everywhere and everything.  I think as the missions get tougher the players are going to get overwhelmed and have to learn to organize and trust each other.

Even with the 2nd printing card error, we had to have this one.

This is officially moving to a 10.  With our group this game is just darn good.

This is a unique, exciting, real-time cooperative game. With a time-controlled script playing, several people have to run around a star ship and do various things to protect them from threats and dangers. After it's over, you replay through the moves and see how well you coordinated with each other. Great sci-fi themed game.

I've played this game about a dozen at this point, but I've only played the full game twice.

This is because this game has a system to explain the rules where you slowly add more complex elements to the game. This is a really excellent way to teach the game without having to spend an hour decoding the rules. However, this is unfortunate because if you're playing with even 1 new player you have to start over from the beginning.

Despite this, the game is fantastic and unlike anything I have in my collection now, or am likely to have in my collection at any point in the future.

I don't love real-time and programming in games, but I don't mind it if it fits the theme. This game - not the case. Those stupid mistakes couldn't happen on the space ship. If you want immersive co-op boardgame about space - look somewhere else.

- Whole expirience feels lame.
- Art on the cards don't correspond to the art of the board.
- Too complex for what it is.

Really? [i]Really?[/i] This is not all that, with or without a bag of chips.  The game is simply not very difficult outside the exercise in communication.  The game is alternately frustrating or boring.  The enemies are flavorless and generic, and the game is prone to bossiness and tense yet lackadaisical play.  Replays are pretty stagnant.  Even its touted innovation falls somewhat flat.  It feels like [gameid=30549] or any other coop game mixed with [gameid=23451].  It's just a gimmick game.

Great, fun, chaotic, real-time, co-operative game trying to run a space ship and survive alien attacks for just ten minutes. Hilarious when you mess up and lose.

Doing it with a crew of incompetent idiots (including yourself), that is a real challenge. How can it be so stupidly difficult to do basic things such a go left/right/up/down and push three different colours of buttons?

It's probably a given that a player playing this game for the first time will get lost.  There's a LOT to track in this game, and understanding how it all works together without having played it is a little daunting.  It's not impervious, but any means, but it's a serious challenge.  Once the game gets going, though, it starts to become a little clearer, and you realize that this game is Crisis Management in a Box.  It's another programming game, a la RoboRally, where if you make a mistake at any point, there's a good chance that your whole plan is shot to hell, but if you can get beyond the tragedy of a loss and enjoy the experience of the game, it can be a lot of fun.  I also think that experience will help players better understand how to play their cards based on their information.  At least, I hope so; I'd like to think that it's possible to survive a mission.

Great fun.  The 10mins of game is so much fun and the pressure and stress of trying to work it all out as a team is awesome.

Co-op games have a tendency to either lend themselves to an alpha running the game for everyone, or needing a traitor to pit players against each other.  Space alert doesn't do those things, instead time pressure means that everyone needs to handle some problems themselves, while communicating only essential information to the other players.  Its a co-op game where the players really have to cooperate with each other, rather than taking orders and playing 'perfectly'.  Combine this with modifiable difficulty and I can never see this game getting old.

We're still yet to survive a round of Space Alert and it's completely fine with me if we never do.

Finally played this (with 3, so 1 android, but I'm still not positive I did the card distribution correctly). I see the upside, but the downside is a very steep learning curve for a game like this. It's short and rich, but you have to invest quite a bit to get to that point. Trademark Chvatil (well, not the short bit, but the investment in learning bit).

I still think the solo game is just too unwieldy compared to others in this genre, but am willing to give it another go.

By far my favourite co-op game.  Its play time is consistent (and quick) due to the game's audio tracks, no problems with Alpha players, is super tense, and is just right on the difficulty curve.

A ton of fun.  Sort of like Robo-Rally, everyone programs all their actions in one phase, then evaluates them in another, watching the chaos unfold.  Unlike Robo-Rally, it's cooperative, so the timed programming phase is frantic coordination mayhem instead of silent concentration.

Shares a lot of thematic elements with Galaxy Trucker, and has a similar out-of-control feel, though with completely different mechanics.  It's the kind of game I would want to always break out with new people to see how they interact and because of the sheer novelty of it, but there's just too much going on to pick up quickly.  So instead it's the sort of game you'll wind up playing with the same group over and over again--while that's sure to still be fun for quite a while, it also limits it a bit in the long run.

Since I don't own the game, I'll always be playing with Heidi and Jason, and I'd love to play with them any time.

Continues to be excellent - the table talk is great, although you can get so engrossed that you miss computer announcements.  

An expansion for this is a no-brainer - more cards (the decks are thin enough that I tend to see the same threats and trajectories over and over,  although I'm somehow able to shuffle things such that the same cards are always on top!).  Things I'd like to see - more threat cards of all types,  some kind of theming for a particular session (special decks?  special rules? special tracks?)  Alternative systems and ships (maybe a "build your own ship" mode,  with alternative weapon systems).  Have MIRV missiles that hit everything in all zones within range,  or cannons with higher damage but minimum range.  Maybe even cannons that use more power but deal more damage.  Shield Penetration.  Head-to-head team games,  or multi-ship insanity missions?  Or "boss" ships - maybe a threat board with a giant threat to attack or survive.  Maybe a random threat generator - a deck of cards paired with a sandtimer or somesuch.  

Played, and officially awesome. 

Player order cards are smaller than expected (they're the mini-size cards), as are the rest of the bits (pics on BGG are, as usual,  zoomed in and make everything look huge).  Perfectly serviceable though,  played with the glass pieces.  

Seeing things from across the table might be tough,  but seemed okay.  Frantic,  but hilarious.  Already want to play again - rating is tentative,  and it might be a while before I get to play again...

The only con I can see (this is a not insignificant con):  looks like it'll cost about the same as Galaxy Trucker (ie around $70)

On the way (thanks for importing,  FunGamesCafe!)

I hate the time pressure. The audio track irritates me as does the constant stream of talking/yelling to plan the game. I usually like games that are cooperative but there are too many tasks to be completed in this one, so it's difficult to coordinate without my feeling stressed. Plus, the addition of having a silent period is frustrating (although the ability to trade cards occasionally is great). I have no idea what is going on in this game and I need to be told exactly what to do, or be assigned a very specific/easy task (like, for example, "jiggling" the mouse or getting the robots). I find that I lose track of what round we're on and when attacks will occur and where everyone is/what they're doing. Overall, it's just too much for me- definitely one I won't want to play again if I can help it. I think even with a different crowd and more experience, I'd still hate this game.

RATING: 10
Pure chaos.  Ten minutes of yelling and shuffling cards and game pieces around while trying to remain aware of everything that's happening around you.  It's not just the game mechanics (which are very solid) that make Space Alert so fun, but the group experience that the game offers.  You get to work together to solve problems, but it's light and fast enough that you can laugh whenever a hilarious accident causes the ship to explode.  This is a rollercoaster of a boardgame, and it is simply awesome with the right group.

Hectic and confusing cooperative game played in real-time (10 minute).  Fairly simple in one sense; You use cards to programme your character to do one of a fairly short list of actions: go left, go right, go up/down, press button a, button b, button c, use battlebots.  Behind that is enough complexity that the game comes with six training missions to get you used to everything that you can achieve using those those commands.  This is not a pick-up-and-play game but has potential to be very fun once you half-way know what you're doing.

Dicipline en snelheid zijn vereist voor deze real-time co-op.

Spelers zijn verkenners die reizen met ruimteschip 'Sitting Duck'. Ze moeten er voor zorgen dat tijden de verkenningsvlucht het schip heel blijft. Het schip zal allerlei problemen tegenkomen zoals aanvallen van grote ruimteschepen, maar ook binnendringenede aliëns en bommen. Alleen door goed samen te werken en duidelijk en snel te handelen kunnen de grootste gevaren afgeweerd worden.

RATING: 6
The mechanics of this game solves one of the common cooperative complaints - one player can't play everyone. Sure, you need someone to be a captain and coordinate things, but unlike say Pandemic, people have to think/make their own decisions for the group to be successfull. That said, it's a little too frantic for me.

My rating for this game has gradually gone up with further playings. On the proviso that:
a) people are at the same learning level. Otherwise people can let the whole team down.
b) People are into co-op games. If not, don't bother
c)Play with 4 players and start with the whole tutorial scenarios and build up to the full game. So while this game takes 10-15 minutes to play and another 10 to resolve. To teach the game and work through the scenarios for first time players usually means it's a complete nights worth of gaming.

RATING: 9
Like RoboRally on steroids.  Our group has played through the tutorials and the basic simulation.  Really hard to win.  Not sure if we're ready for the Advanced Simulation or an actual mission yet, based on our results so far.  It's a hoot though!  For the 10 frantic minutes of the Action Round, it's challenging to say the least and requires dedicated cooperation and concentration.  Once the Action Round is completed, everyone breathes a sigh of relief and relaxes to watch the Resolution Round unfold.  You'll laugh and you'll cry, as your best-laid plans often go up in smoke because of a player mistake, or some unanticipated event like damage to a ship component.  The Resolution Round is fun stuff and will generate groans when things don't work out, cheers when they do, and laughs as you find out just how tough it is to save your spaceship.

This is not my kind of game but it is well conceived. The CD is a timer. You must decide your teams actions and then do them as assigned. Often this causes one player to move an elevator before another has a chance to get on it or shoot a gun without the explosive. Fun but nerve racking.

Highly original real-time team game. It's very satisfying when you win and usually hilarious when you lose. A bit like RoboRally meets an office team-building exercise in space, but much better than that sounds. Individual games are quick but the whole thing has a fairly long learning curve, so you really need to commit to playing several games within a short space of time otherwise everyone will forget how to play properly.

Considerably improved by the experience system provided by The New Frontier expansion.

1st Impression:

I laugh during unboxing. What kind of game rated so highly with this kind of components? The cards so thin, the miniature so tiny and ridiculous. The board cut unevenly. What a mediocre production!

Admittedly we all spoiled by FFG quality components. Most of my games are theirs, so our expectation of any new board games, components wise, are always high. Everything gets compared to FFG. 

Then we read the rulebook...The best I've ever read!

Then we tried the first mission. we start the play button. and here's us during planning: http://i256.photobucket.com/albums/hh187/cstyles45/Funneh/48569325_omg_reaction_gif.gif

RATING: 7
Space Alert certainly is unique in the inclusion of soundtracks as part of the gameplay.  The frantic and chaotic nature can be attributed to two sources: unfamiliarity with the game itself and with the people you are with.  Once you know how to communicate effectively within the time constraint, as well as what to expect in terms of the different events (the appearance of external threats, data transfer, system malfunction, etc), the occurrences of talking over each other and running out of time become less and less of an issue.  Dominating personalities in co-op games is usually a bad thing to have.  Space Alert legitimizes these players by putting them in the role of "captain" and the "communication officer".  Now it is ok for them to tell people what they should be doing in order to achieve the objective.  Is that a bad thing?  That's for you to decide. 

Ultimately, I feel that Space Alert is more of a gimmick than a revolutionary gaming experience.  It is no different than having another person with a stopwatch dictating a set of instructions to the group.  The replayability is also another matter of concern, especially for those that have become familiar with the game flow.  I know that by our third session we completed our action selections way before the time ran out so we were just sitting around waiting for the audio to finish.  Not a game I feel the need to own.  I may play again with different people but I do think I've already seen all there is to offer here.

After a few more plays, I've realized that this game can be just brutal if you get a randomly synergistic (in a bad way) combination of threats.

The most wonderful of all co-operative games. You're playing a team of space ship crew members trying to shoot down enemies and fix the problems that occur, all the while a CD spits out new threats coming to destroy the ship.
What makes this game shine is that, unlike other co-ops where it easily happens that the dominating player sort of plays the game for all other players, Space Alert relies on the weakest link in the chain. So much is happening that no single person possibly can steer the details of all: Each player must do his own, and take responsibilty for what may go wrong on his station. The game mechanisms are designed so that what is needed is perfect synchronization of the team mates, and it's very important that certain tasks are performed with a certain timing. Absolutely perfect co-op game.

My group is obsessed with this game. We play 5-8 missions every night we play, which can be up to 2x per week. That's a lot considering how casual we are. Absolutely fantastic. Rulebook includes an amazing set of tutorial missions that walk you through the mechanics at the perfect pace. May seem like there are a lot of rules before you buy, but the game includes just the right amount of information to make it hectic and mess up your plans -- in a fun way, not an overbearing one. Best game I've ever played, even after 70+ missions.

Very unique game and I’m lucky to have played this with the right group. I can argue that it’s a stressful game that feels more like work and me being more of a lone strategic planner , it not being the kind of game I like.  Despite this feeling the group dynamics and team building it provides is a great merit to the design skills of Vlaada. I could find myself in the role of safety officer and enjoyed seeing how each mission resolved from looking bleak to surprisingly surviving the challenges the game throws at us.

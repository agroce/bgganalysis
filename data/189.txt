RANK: 1581

RATING: 7
A few more options than standard game and a little less luck makes this one of my favourite Settlers options. Whether the fixed board means replay value is not as great as the base game remains to be seen
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Very nice game. The introduction of cards to replace dice (compared with standard Settlers) is controversial because there is the possibility that somebody who wants to spend the effort and has a good memory will accurately work out what is coming towards the end of a pack and take advantage accordingly.

The introduction of the money layer is a nice idea, though. However, I have to say that getting to 13 points is non-trivial, and in a balanced game can be a bit tedious towards the end, whereas in Settlers (as in most games) the player who starts to run away with things, tends to win quickly and painlessly.

Very surprised that this has not attracted more 10's. The afternoon that I spent playing this and 'Tikal' must rank as the most enjoyable and productive that I can remember. For my money, this is better than the origional 'Settlers', and along with 'Tikal' and 'Civilization' is one the best games in my collection.

A stand alone version of Settlers, makes for a very tense 4 player game.
Unlike Settlers the board is set up and not variable, but there are 2 areas to build in. Dice are replaced by cards, so no chance of 5 being rolled 6 times in a row. A very nice game to play if you want to play a slightly different Settlers.

One of the better variants of the Siedler of Catan. More strategic and a lot more to consider. The system is making use of event cards with numbers instead of dice. I like this feature because this reduces luck and the events make it a bit more interesting. The components are also very nice. Overall I think it is a good game, especially I you are a fan of the Siedler series. I do think that the game would be better if it was finished within one and a half hour, the games I played so far took slightly more than 120 minutes.

While Seafarers, Cities & Knights, Traders & Barbarians, and Explorers & Pirates represent the core variants to the well-known Settlers of Catan franchise, the Settlers of Nuremberg functions as an all together independent gaming experience that borrows elements from its predecessor while also introducing several novel changes to gameplay (beyond that of the aforementioned expansions).

Abandoning the modular board and random number distribution set up characteristic of the Settlers of Catan, the hexagonal terrain tiles (and their numbers) surrounding the city of Nuremberg are fixed.  However, the map now includes several paved roads from Nuremberg to other large cities in Europe that players will play all road and settlement pieces on.  Placement of settlements not only determines a player's access to resources from activated terrain tiles, but also determines any tax that might be owed to the player who has the majority control over each of the different roads from Nuremberg.

The game board also includes a separate map of Nuremberg, with different hexagonal spaces corresponding to different manufactured goods.  While players don't have the option of building cities worth 2 points a piece that provide 2 resources from activated tiles, players instead can build factories worth 1 point within the city of Nuremberg that will enable them to produce goods worth varying amounts of gold.  Players with majority control of different roads leading out of Nuremberg also get to tax the sell of these goods, as they are "transported" along their roads to neighboring cities in Europe.

Money functions as a 6th resource, that can not only be used to trade with other players and the bank, but it's also used in the construction of the city's wall. Constructing portions of the city wall earn players prestige points, that may ultimately earn them bonus points to their overall total (in Nuremberg, 13 points are needed to win).  Players can still earn bonus points for majority control of roads (much like the longest road bonus in Catan); however, there are no development cards or progress cards and therefore no largest army bonus available in Nuremberg.  Players only have 5 settlements and 5 factories to build, so acquisition of the road and prestige bonus points are nearly essential for victory.

In Nuremberg, the 2 six-sided dice that determined tile activation are replaced by a deck of cards. These cards proportionately determine which tiles are activated, as well as when the robber comes and goes, which roads might be taxed, and when you might be able to construct portions of the city wall at a discount.  They also determine progression along a 3-year time track, which essentially limits the gamelength to a certain number of passes through the deck.  This can potentially enable a player to win the game without 13 points, simply by having the highest point total after 3 years.

While Catan is one of the most commercially successful boards games in recent decades, it often seems like a gateway game that gets new players into the tabletop gaming hobby, but is then quickly abandoned on for more challenging euro-style games.  Nuremberg offers much more competitive and challenging gameplay for experienced gamers and would probably be rated more favorably on BGG if it had ever been printed in English.

[Bought it at KublaCon. Traded for Neuland (1st edition) in a math trade.]
I expected to like this a lot more than I did. The lack of cities makes resources really hard to come by. The gold makes up for that, but if you don't have a toll road, then you have no access to gold. There's no way to catch up if you fall way behind. I'm guessing (and hoping) the experience is better with 4 players.

RATING: 6.5
Disappointing first play.  Plays out like standard Settlers, where someone gets out to an early lead but gets bashed for a while until the scores are fairly close and a lucky person wins.  Some things seem unbalanced.  (1) the 3:1 space in the city (which touches the tower area & compass commodity).  (2) ownership of the "trade" routes seems to pay more than owning the other routes.  (3) the layout of the hexes & number tokens is annoying... often it is hard to get on more than one good number.

RATING: 6.75
Interesting take on Settlers, which can end up confusing you as you end up trying to play normal settlers when you shouldn't! 

The introduction of gold and prestige along with an event card /dice deck works pretty well alongside a split board, representing Nurnburg city along with the surrounding roads and countryside.

However, there's one issue with the game that we could see in that there is very little you can do with wheat and this does appear to unbalance it a little.

The only fly in the ointment here is the lack of a Knight/Ritter-equivilent, which can make it hard to protect yourself from the Robber; the Robber can stay on your hex for ages and you'll have no power to remove him. Otherwise, though, a very fine variant on the basic game. The cards are not a big win over dice, but good for a change.

Excellent additions/variations to the Settlers system!  I don't think it's as good as Settlers of the Stone Age and it's not as divergent as Starfarers but it brings its own unique qualities to the table.  I like the city board a lot and I think having other commodites which are exchangable for gold is a great idea (for all those times you've ever wanted to build someting with three ore and a wood!).  The toll system is neat and I really liked the wall/tower building.  A great addition to the Settlers family, no doubt.

RATING: 7
A fully seperate game variant of Settlers as good as the original. Like Cities and Knights it has more elements than settlers, actually there are really almost two stages to this game the country side like settlers and then a city stage. However I didn't see anymore room for diversity in strategy than settlers had.

Really good Settlers flavor. Better than Stone Age. German components not a problem at all. Having played way too much SoC and C&K, this was a welcome surprise. There's a more developed economy, with both gold and prestige, on top of the usual 5 resources. More strategy, less tactical positioning (blocking) on the board. More longest road fighting, since there are now five roads, each that provide vp for having the most roads (toll booths) on, as well as collecting gold as tolls during the game.

An mildly interesting variant of Settlers that adds money and tolls.

Unfortunately, we discovered that it's too easy to get into a vicious cycle where you can't get any money because you've lost all your cards to tolls...because you can't get any money...and so on.

My least favorite of the Settlers variants so far.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A thoughtful step up from basic settlers with several more ways to earn points and additional strategies and options. This can make for a better game or just a longer one depending on who you play with. :-)

The absence of dice makes no difference since deck of cards has the same effect of benefiting some players over others. In fact, probably more so. The unchanging board makes little difference in this variation.

Building on both boards can get quite tight. 

An enjoyable game for those that are ready for a slightly more gamer's version of Settlers.

All these Settlers variants perplex me.  Each one seems to add something I like, add something I don't like, take away something I didn't like and take away something I did like.  I guess I'll have to keep trying them.

My basic problem with this one is that it gets rid of two elements that I prefer from the original - the dice rolling for goods, and [vastly more importantly] the randomized setup.

I would like the city building, but the game seemed to progress too quickly, which made the second map seem woefully underused.  Seems like it needs a higher win point total, or smaller rewards for accomplishments.

Another "Settlers". The fixed layout of numbers remove a dynamic component and the divided gameboard tends to confuse new players. Apart from that, it's the old and proven gather-build-trade-concept.

RATING: 7
Prefer this to plain Settlers.  The extra actions in the city plus the extra currency of money (in addition to the wood, sheep, brick etc.) help to keep the game moving along toward completion.  The deck of dice helps prevent players from being shut out of the action due to poor dice rolls. We don't play enough for the static board to prove bothersome.   

There is a fair bit of German on the cards and board, but a single simple translation gets everyone on the same page.  It causes so little trouble that I play this with my daughter and son (aged 8 and 6).

No comment on initial play.

Update (10/01/11): It is supposedly as simple as Settlers, but now split into two meta-games: the road-building and resource gathering aspect outside of the city, and the area-grab/tech upgrade aspect inside the city. Instead of dice, there is a card deck of "die rolls" with exact distribution. So, there is no annoying lucky-streaks that plagues the original, like the time when nothing but 5s and 10s were rolled. However, there are random events scattered in the deck too. Nice touch. It was mildly interesting, but I suspect it will be a long time before we pull this one out again to the table.

It is a meatier game than your average Catan. Building location is somewhat less restrictive, and there is this weird aspect of money/tolls to wrap your head around. An interesting variant.

Also it uses a dice deck that also can trigger events (such as tolls on roads). Overall, I really like this mechanic.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
In spite of its many changed elements this is a fairly straightforward Catan variant. The fixed board means that there are a very limited number of 'good spots' and that gives an advantage to the start player. Wheat is much less valuable than in the standard game as it's the one commodity you can't trade for gold in the city. However, it's the 'dice deck' that leaves me with the most mixed feelings. In spite of reduced randomness I think Settlers actually NEEDS dice to be exciting, this I actually found rather dull.

RATING: 7.5
Based on 3+ plays.  Nurnberg sits between Seafarers and Cities & Knights in complexity.  It would rate higher were it not for a few small flaws.  Obviously, the board is static, which detracts from replayability.  The prestige point bonus for being in first (4 points) is too big for my tastes - it's easy for the game to end abruptly if people aren't careful.  And the fact that you can trade gold at 3:1 at the appropriate port creates semi-degenerate combos with some of the goods production, which goes against the spirt of the Settlers game.  Still, it's a refreshing change of pace from the original game.  Plus, the dice deck is fantastic - I've incorporated it with minor changes into my basic Settlers game.

I found this limited reprint in an English web store and I had to have it. True it is just a Settlers game, but with a little differens from the original game. For instance, instead of rolling a dice for the robber, you turn over a card. The cards are, compared to a dice, statistically correct.

Uncertain as to what I think about this game after my first play.  Definitely some different twists in this breakoff, stand alone version of Settlers in which the resources are pretty much the same, but brings toll roads, workshops, and commodities and money into play as well as a deck of dice/event cards.  Two areas are played on the board including the countryside for gathering resources and the city of Nuremburg for building workshops, walls, and towers to gain prestige, sell combinations of resources which make commodities for money.  Victory points seem a bit tighter in this version which pretty much requires a bit of player conflict whether it be via toll booths or prestige points.  

Sold in the Lydia charity auction.  Rather just play one of the Settlers variants.

I actually really enjoy playing Settlers of Catan (and its spinoffs) and am sad that it's now in vogue to hate on this family of games. I was glad to be able to try out this uncommon title. 

It's Catan, but this time there's a city in which you can build factories and manufacture goods for export. The roads are the actual roads out of town, so exporting means paying tolls. It works really well, even though we got a rule wrong.

Probably the best Settlers variant out there. The introduction of the Bauhaus district to make extra goods and earn gold to build walls an towers gives you more ways to score VPs. Trade route control is also a great twist. Points shift more readily during the game. Top quality components, but requires a translation, since the game was never published in English.

While it might get repetitive after about 15 plays or so, its an interesting variant that manages to somewhat remove the frustrating element that is in regular settlers. The whole gold/nuremberg/wall thing is really cool and gives you something to do if your cards don't get 'rolled'.

Definitely better than Basic Catan! I like this game very, and everybody who once played, like it too. My only idea is that it's better to play until somebody reach 14 "Siegpunkt" instead of 13, wich sometimes result in a to short play.

07/10/03 Received. A complete game, unlike most Settlers variants/scenarios. I've tricked out my copy with a lot of English translations pasted on the council cards and board. Most of my games have ended in a flurry, with a large score change on the last turn by someone. In regular Settlers you usually see who will win long before the game ends. Not always so in this game (in my experience). I've never seen the walls built more than half way around the city. As of 08/02/17 I've played 13 times. Two of those ended due to time running out (reaching 1400 AD).

A meaty overlooked Catan variant which has some very unique differences from the "vanilla" version.  There's somewhat of an economic track and even a bit of area control ("roads" & walls).  There are 5 "roads" coming off of Nurberg where roads can be built.    Anybody can build a road off of another (I'm not sure if they're even called roads here).  You can build only on areas where you have built roads and whoever has the most roads in an area gets that areas point card and can collect tolls (which show up in event cards and when players make manufactured goods).  

Nurnberg itself is a city map where players build workshops for the right to gain bonuses when making manufactured goods and the ability to build towers.  City walls and towers can be built with gold and whoever has the majority (first) receives a high point card (4 points), second and third place receive 3 & 2 point cards and the cards will change hands as appropriate.

Players can use their "farmed" goods to make manufactured goods (such as armor, etc.) to earn the gold they would use to build the towers.  Each manufactured good is connected to an area of the board where the person who built the most roads in that area can collect a toll (gold) when that good is built.It still feels like a Catan game but it's different enough to warrant a try if you haven't given it a shot yet.  However, I don't believe a US version was ever made.

It keeps the tokens / prestige layer from Alexander the Great where gold and resources get turned into prestige which are worth VP’s. It divides the game board into 5 long ‘roads’. The right of way on each is worth a VP and is awarded to whoever builds the most brick & wood ‘tollways’ on it. You can only build settlements on roads on which you have a tollway, but you can build anywhere along it, not necessarily next to a tollway. Plus you can build workshops which allow you to spend resources to get gold (doubled if you control the right of way on the right road), or to build prestige directly. Workshops are also worth a VP. No longest road. No armies. No cities. No dice rolls - you use a deck. Most cards double up resource production with a special effect (move the robber, pay a gold for each settlement on a particular road to the right of way owner, etc).

Brick seemed to be the commodity of choice in the game. You need it for tollways, settlements and workshop goods. With no cities and with a distributed deck, resources seem to flow more evenly but a bit more slowly. I think we clocked in at around 90 minutes. More things to compete over and choose between, more freedom in your placements and buildings.

Catan has made a career out of making expansions and reworks of the game that only add minimal changes. This game, however, is a rework of the original that (I believe) improves greatly on it. The grouping of the goods stretches players to trade and extend beyond their comfort area, for instance. The street tolls are a brilliant touch as well. I think I will have to jettison my original Catan for this. FYI -- the cards are in German, but you can easily translate the basics (robber, remove robber, time change).

I guess this Seidler variant addresses the complaints/problems with basic settlers made by gamers. No dice to disrupt plans, instead a deck of numbered cards in exact bell curve distribution with some additional events to consider. I prefer dice as this provides a feeling of control of your destiny, rather than the mentally tiresome monitoring of what numbers have been and gone and to speculate where best to place your next settlement or robber. In this variant a layer of money management has been added to provide progress down another avenue for victory points: the costly building of Nurnberg city walls and towers leads to having oneself becoming a council member and the subsequent points this earns. Money also allows you to buy resources as well as meeting the costs of toll charges imposed by events, preventing the loss of a resource. To make money involves "trading" other resource combinations, so giving you more options resource-wise. More options may give you more flexibility, but it means more thinking time, and with 4 players this can drag on. Not only did I miss the dice but I missed the cities for double production and the tension of the robber, for in Nurnberg, workshop placement entitles you to double the money received. As someone else commented, there are no knight cards to move the robber. Overall, interesting option-wise but slow and dry.

An interesting Settlers variant that uses a deck of dice with events, and a two section game board with the inner city of Nurnberg on one side and resource hexes on the other. The game adds enough to be novel and interesting, but at least in a 3 player game, there appeared to be serious balance issues.

My biggest problem is if someone pulls a "longest road" out from under you. Early in the game, when players have yet to build a workshop to start shipping goods, the toll road penalty can be too punishing without a steady stream of gold. Giving up many random card to the toll road owner started to give me visions of a "death spiral" which seems to be common in unbalanced games. I think a good alternative would be for the infringing player to decide which good to give as a toll. 

I did manage to right the ship, but much too late at that point: flooding the market with unfavorable 4:1 trades didn't work well in my favor. Grain was in short supply, and it wasn't traded much early in the game, and because of that I was the last one to finally get a workshop down. This put me at a huge gold disadvantage, and not enough time to start a comeback.

I'm glad I own this, but much like the Troy historical scenario, this one left me feeling a little cold. I'd like to try this with 4 before I finalize my rating.

You have to give credit for coming up with such an interesting, unique variation of Settlers.  The rules are far more complex than the original, although once you start playing it seems surprisingly simple.  A bit on the longish side too, but it plays out well fortunately.  I have never used a system before similar to the "deck of dice," so that was interesting to try.  I discovered that I vastly prefer a good old-fashioped roll of the dice and the variances that can result.  For this game, you could always make a list of the corresponding actions associated with each dice roll, then set the cards aside and use dice.

I like this in general, but for me it suffers in comparison to the classic original.  To me, Settlers is a fantastic and fast-paced 30-45 minute game.  The other related games I have played mainly add a bunch of time to the basic game, and I don't feel that the Settlers framework can handle it.  Still, this version is pretty deep and is more confrontational than the base game.

Played once and want to play again since we went with the recommended set-up.  I think you could do away with the money and wall sections, but oh well.  My first game caused my group to finally say that I "think too much on my turns" which slowed the game down, but I didn't pick up the "obvious" plays as fast as they did.
Can't wait to play again and I'll probably get accused of playing without thinking enough about how my plays help the leader next time :-)

A very worthwhile addition to the Settlers family, with certainly enough differences from basic Settlers to justify the price and hassle.

(after 1 4p game)  I've only played a handful of basic Settlers of Catan so the added twists to expansions or "Catan like" games does not appeal to me too much.   I enjoyed it, but I'd rather play basic Settlers with gamers who have less than 10 plays in.  I think I woulod do much better on a 2nd playing and focus much more on the roads and getting gold.

This is Settlers with mechanics to alleviate some of the problems in the base game.  Cards do different things, and the actions are valued differently based on attempting equality for all players, but it still doesn't strike me as something to play over regular Settlers.  This could change with more plays, though.

I really like the 2-part focus of this game, where you can focus on gathering resources and controlling access roads on one side, and also focus on the city itself, with its various types of production, building walls, etc.

And while I don't have a problem with the concept of rolling dice, this comes with, in effect, a dice deck to quiet the dice naysayers out there.

This is a fun game to play.

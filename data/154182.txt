Have only played once with 3 and it played ok.  No random setup so all games are the same.  Once you find the optimal strategy you will play the game the same way every time.  The game will be fun until that point is reached.

A quite interesting action selection game. There are only three types of actions available which can be used in three different ways – acquire land, build a building or move the sun (=land produces resources). The trick here is that the total number of each type of action is limited for all players. Thus it becomes a race to take the actions you want. Moreover, you are trying to collect sets with the action tiles to gain bonus action. Hence you often find yourself taking a suboptimal action just to get that bonus action. You also have to decide which buildings to build, because you most probably will not be able to construct them all. This presents the main part of long term strategic planning in the game.

The only thing that feels a bit detached from the rest of the game is the character tiles. Since you already have the special land tiles giving bonuses at the end of the game, the reason for having another layer of game end special scoring remains a mystery. It almost feels like the designer had the idea for game mechanics but found out that it resulted in a surplus of resources. Thus, in order to balance the game, new places to spend the resources were needed. I admit that this most likely is not true, but this is only to express how pasted on the character cards feel like.

Nevertheless, Helios is a nice little game I enjoy. Plays relatively fast and since you cannot achieve everything, you really have to choose what to concentrate on. Use of symbols and the rich colour palette may not be the most pleasant aspects of the game but they can be forgiven.

A lot to like here on initial impression.  The tile placement and sun rotation mechanics are very interesting.  There isn't enough time in the game to do everything, so I think this would support a high degree of replayability notwithstanding its relatively static initial setup.  

I'd like to play this more to explore a variety of different strategies (e.g., a temple-heavy strategy rather than a city-building heavy strategy, for example, or a strategy where maximum effort is made to rotate the sun repeatedly around the landscape) to determine whether there is one obviously-better path.  On first impression it doesn't seem so.  

It seems as though this would play better with three or four instead of just two.  With two players, while it is enjoyable, it seems too easy to get matching colored sets of action markers, and the choice over which people to hire also is less interesting (because you'll end up hiring enough to not make the marginal points granted by any one person that important).  I wish this had done better commercially to warrant another person expansion.

A very good and moderately light game. The short game-length is great, because you cannot waste any time in building up your engine: you must get to work on it immediately! Helios borders dangerously close to multi-player solitaire, but doesn't quite cross that line: players must keep an eye on what their opponents are doing. There are a number of strategic options to keep things interesting; BUT...

...if you have played any standard engine-building, point-salad euro, then you've already played Helios! There is nothing original about it. If you don't own any game that fits the description above, then this might be a good game to get; otherwise, you already own it! Another complaint I have is the player-aid cards: they tell you the turn order and the game-end scoring, but not the effects of your actions (resource generation and in-game point scoring), of which there are many.

Per quanto riguarda i materiali sono buoni e funzionali a quello che è il gioco.Le due plance di gioco mi sono piaciute moltissimo per lo stile tuttavia l'iconografia non è chiara fin da subito e spesso e volentieri bisogna far riferimento alla leggenda del manuale per capire cosa si può fare su ogni casa disponibile.
Per quanto riguarda la meccanica è come se mancasse qualcosa.L'idea è carina.Puoi amministrare le tue mosse su 2 plance ma nessuna delle 2 alla fine ti soddisfa davvero.Insomma...si poteva fare di piu e bisognava fare di piu con un gioco che ha dalla sua la bella grafica ma che alla fine si rivela piuttosto anonimo.

Εδώ έχουμε ένα Light προς medium, resource management eurogame με χλιαρό fantasy theme όπου οι παίκτες έχουν από ένα πλανήτη τον οποίο αυξάνουν σταδιακά σε μέγεθος και τα resources που βγάζει χτίζουν κτήρια και ναούς πάνω του. Ενδιαφέρον παρουσιάζει ο κεντρικός μηχανισμός με τον ήλιο που γυρίζει γύρω από τον πλανήτη μας και μόνο οι περιοχές που φωτίζονται παράγουν υλικά.

Το παιχνίδι είναι αρκετά απλό στην εξήγηση του καθώς τα διαθέσιμα actions είναι 3 όλα και όλα. Έχουμε ένα action που διαλέγεις tile και το προσθέτεις στον πλανήτη σου. Τα tiles είναι 5-6 ειδών με το κάθε τύπο εδάφους να παράγει διαφορετικό υλικό. Υπάρχει μετά το build action όπου δίνουμε τα υλικά μας και κατασκευάζουμε κάποια κτήρια που μας παρέχουν ειδικές ικανότητες. Κάθε παίκτης έχει διαθέσιμα ακριβώς τα ίδια κτήρια και πρέπει να επιλέξει ποια θα χτίσει με βάση την στρατηγική που θέλει να ακολουθήσει.

Επίσης μπορείς να χτίσεις ναούς που τοποθετούνται σε κάποιο tile του πλανήτη σου και πλέον το tile αντί για resources θα παράγει VP όταν φωτίζεται από τον ήλιο. Το τελευταίο action είναι φυσικά η κίνηση του ήλιου που πηγαίνει κυκλικά γύρω από τον πλανήτη μας και εκεί που σταματάει φωτίζει και παράγουμε τα υλικά.

Στο παιχνίδι υπάρχουν και κάποιες προσωπικότητες που τις προσλαμβάνουμε με κρυστάλλους και μας δίνουν extra VP στο τέλος του παιχνιδιού ανάλογα με το τι ζητάει η καθεμία. Αυτοί οι πόντοι είναι σημαντικοί οπότε γίνεται ένας αγώνας στις πρώτες γύρες για το ποιος θα προλάβει τι, και μετά με βάση το τι ζητάνε οι προσωπικότητες που έχεις καταστρώνεις και τα ανάλογα πλάνα, χτίζοντας και τα αντίστοιχα κτήρια. Τουλάχιστον έτσι κύλησε η πρώτη αναγνωριστική παρτίδα που παίξαμε.

Γενικά το παιχνίδι δεν κρατάει πολύ. Έχει λίγες γύρες και δεν προλαβαίνεις να χτίσεις τα πάντα ή να φτιάξεις κάνα τρελό engine. Ο ρυθμός είναι γρήγορος αλλά το interaction μικρό καθώς περιορίζεται κυρίως στο ποιος θα προλάβει τις προσωπικότητες κάτι που μας τελείωσε στο δεύτερο από τα 4-5 rounds του παιχνιδιού. Κανένα παράπονο από την ποιότητα παραγωγής.

Αξιόλογη προσπάθεια αλλά δεν μου έκανε το κλικ. Δεν βρήκα κάτι που θα το κάνει να ξεχωρίσει από τα υπόλοιπα παιχνίδια της κατηγορίας.

Well-crafted game, but wide choice of moves leads to AP.  Reminded of Key Harvest boards, building up connected hexes, and Keyflower for game feel and end bonus tiles, but without the fun factor.  Rules seemed to suggest that only 3 opportunities (in 3 player version) to acquire bonus tiles - at end of each round and only one could be activated per round.  Felt restrictive as did the tiles allowing you to choose the actions.  Too much frustration about not being able to do things to want to explore deeply, but would play again.  Traded with friend immediately after for HiG's Pantheon, which is a bit lighter, but more fun.

The components and art are excellent. This is definitely the kind of Euro game I enjoy playing. I believe there are many strategies to follow. I do wish there was a bit more of a random setup to increase the re-playability. An expansion would do a lot to round out this game. However, it didn't do very well financially so that won't be happening. As it is, I imagine the gameplay would feel stale after half a dozen plays.

This is a light spatial puzzle game with mechanics that I enjoy.

First i thought the game solvable, but after several plays I have jet to find a strategy that is better than the other. Many paths to victory is possible. The game is very tight and you have limited action. I found it much more fun with 4 player than with less. There is much more competition for the characters in 4 player game! 3-2 player is still fun.

A note on the theme, for me it works. I can picture this bizarre fantasy world where the sun moves around and stone grovs haha.

I strongly recommend using the expansion

An abstract Euro that I found pretty interesting. The rotating sun is a new idea that I hadn't seen before and the different options for scoring are neat. I'm not sure how much lasting power is here, but I'd like to try some of the different ways that it seems one could generate a ton of points.

Variant for 2 players
Option 1: Make things more expensive 
5 tiles of a color are needed to earn a free action, rather than just 4. 
Characters cost 1 mana more than the printed cost.

Option 2: Dice-driven dummy player
Use the 3-player rules (3 rounds, 6 action turns per phase 1). Dummy player “Hal” can receive the start player token. I’d suggest selecting the start player randomly, with Hal having an equal chance.

In phase 1, on Hal’s turn, roll a d6. Start at the first action tile column and count over as many as the die roll. Wrap around to the first column when you reach the end. Skip any empty columns. Hal takes and discards the bottom tile in the column you land on. If Hal takes a land action tile, roll the d6, count across the land tile stacks, and discard the one you land on.

In phase 2, make sure the characters are sorted in ascending order of mana cost (randomly distributed within each group). On Hal’s first turn, roll a d12. Count across that many characters, wrapping back to beginning if needed. Discard the character you land on (this gives a greater chance that the cheaper characters will get discarded). Hal only gets one turn in phase 2.

I like the idea of option 2 because it means you can’t count on certain tiles and characters being available to you, maybe better giving the feel of a game with more players.

Option 3 (the nasty, er I mean strategic variant)
Play as a 4 player game (4 rounds, discard remaining action tiles at the end of every round)

In phase 1, after both players have taken their turns, they then, in turn order, select a tile at the bottom of a column and discard it. Discarding a land action tile also requires the discarding of a land tile or special land tile.

In phase 3, for each player’s sole action on their second turn (or first turn if you are feeling really nasty), she takes a character and discards it.


To everyone who has actually played the game 2 player, is there any merit to any of these?

Helios has some neat stuff going on with the sun revolving around the little world you're building,  activating things wherever it stops. However, that neat mechanism didn't quite pull it out of "eh, that was ok" territory for me.

A few things in the game just seem to plain not work very well. The character tiles are really strange. First off, they're all easily bought by mid-game, since if you don't rush to get them, they'll all be gone. Secondly, they're potentially worth wildly different amounts, with not a huge change in cost. I don't know, just seemed odd.

Other aspects like the color-matching of tiles just seemed kind of tacked on and uninteresting.

Overall,  the main mechanism and multiple avenues to score points were pretty neat, but the game as a whole just seems like it wasn't quite baked all the way.

Maybe most euros are solo puzzles these days since it is just way more difficult to create games with lots of inter-player effects that works. Another game where I barely even glance at my neighbors boards, and have little need to care about what they are doing. There is an action drafting element, so there is a race to get certain things first, but that is the extent of the interaction. Otherwise you are acquiring resources to buy buildings that provide bonuses to actions you take throughout the game.

The novel part of the game is the way the sun rotates around the world you have built and when the sun is shining on adjacent tiles, you either produce resources or score points. That is a fun puzzle to work out, so the game works OK, but it doesn't feel very competitive to me. The stack of available games that can be described like that is growing large.

Helios is a good play.  It feels short to play, as there is a fair amount of pressure to time key actions in the game.

Well balanced game in which you place tiles and temples, and let the sun move around your realm in order to produce and score points. Temples can be placed on your map (but then the tile no longer produces any resources) or on a building on a separate player sheet. Each of these buildings has specific characteristics. Extra points can be scored by placing special tiles and buying persons with manna and activating them with resources. The game plays fluently and there is always something useful to do.

Relatively quick-playing tableau-building Euro (Terra Mystica-Lite!) with a nifty resource-production mechanic, strategic depth without the complexity of a bigger game. Some of the bonus points-scoring Characters seemed significantly stronger than others however (Treasurer, Architect), and as these only become available at the end of the first round, that round can feel scripted as players joust for first dibs. Given the length of the game (4 rounds, 4 turns/round) player order may also be a factor. (June 2015)

This looks to be a very nice midweight eurogame, in the vein of Notre Dame and Yspahan.  I especially like the mechanism of the sun moving round and triggering resource replenishment and scoring.  However, I don't know that it would be good enough to earn shelfspace considering I already have some games I love (such as the two mentioned above) in this category.  If it gets a full expansion that adds variability, I will give it another look.

UPDATE: Bought the game on sale, and the production is awesome.  However, this is another one of those euros where everything you do gives you points.  Feld does a lot fo these games, but he usually adds an interesting mechanism to limit the actions you can take.  Helios doesn't really do this, other than encouraging you to try to build a set of 4 like color tiles.  As such, you get to just sit there and try to work out which action will eeke out an extra point or two for you.

Looking at the artwork, you soon realised that it's by the same artist who did Terra Mystica. They even included two first player markers (the dragon standee), although only one is used in a game.

Helios is mostly a solitary-esque build your own board and hope what you've built scores more points than your opponent. This is definitely going to be a positive point for some and a negative for others. Once you've picked a strategy, it's not a good idea to deviate as the game is over very quickly. On the plus side, there seems to be a number of different paths you can try each game. The sun movement mechanism is particularly innovative in this title. As you expand your land mass, it takes longer to make full revolutions of the sun (which scores you points), and you might not move it as far as possible, due to the fact that you want to stop your sun in specific spots for gathering resources or potentially gaining points from temples. The action selection system seems like something the designers were trying to make innovative, but feels mostly inconsequential. I can see a lot a positives about this title, but it seems to lack some kind of flare to truly excite me. It's definitely worth trying.

Jókat hallottam róla, nagyon tetszett is a design, így nagy kedvvel ültem neki. Sajna csalódást okozott. 
- Ez a sorban lapkavitel szerintem béna. Így az első fordulót gyakorlatilag gép is lejátszhatná helyettünk, mert úgyis mindenki csak lapkát vinni tud, majd építeni, majd újra termelni.
- Béna még az is, hogy az első körben elkel az összes pontozó lapka. Így a későbbiekben a manának nem sok szerepe van, pláne akkor nincs, ha csak egy pontot ér, mert nincs rá semmi extrapontod.
- Ráadásul, aki véletlenül 3 pontozólapkát megszerez az első körben az gyakorlatilag nyert.
- Nincsenek megfelelően kiegyensúlyozva se az extra területek, se a pontozók. Pl. szomszédos üres területekért 1 pont. WTF? Nomeg ott van a templmmos pontozó vs. a terület típusos pontozó. Teljesen ugyanannyiba kerülnek, de a templomos nagyságrendekkel jobb. Olyan mintha egyet se játszottak volna vele a kiadás előtt.

Kár érte, mert közben meg a nap körbemenés marha jó mechanizmus és nagyon hangulatos is. Lapkagyűjtős akciózás se lenne rossz ötlet, de így, hogy csak lentről vihetsz full mák, hogy kinek lesz 4 és kinek csak 3 extra akciója, ráadásul az se mindegy, hogy mikor, mert logikusan korábban nagy előny letudni az extrákat, hiszen akkor egész játék alatt termel. Ez tök jó lenne, csak semmi közöd nincs hozzá, hogy mikor szerzed meg.

RATING: 7
Ein abstraktes Optimierungsspiel alter Schule im beliebigen, aber sonnigen Themenmantel mit einer kleinen Neuerung in Form einer Sonnenscheibe, die eine bunte Auslage aus Hexafeldern umkreist. Ansonsten alles wie gehabt: Rohstoffe sammeln, Personenkarten, Häuserbau und Schlusswertungsplättchen. Verkopfte und Durchdenker werden schnell die effiziente, gewinnsichere Strategie finden und sich dann im Land der Sonne schnell langweilen. Ich gehöre nicht dazu.

RATING: 6
There are some really superb things going on in this game - the placement of the lands and the variability of the sun speed, for example. On the other hand the mana generation and the characters and the many currencies seemed to be extra junk for junk's sake. Also there's way too much iconography so deciphering it takes too many consultations of the rule book. I'd love to see a similar game with a lot of the nonsense removed.

RATING: 7.5
One play with two, two plays with four. Helios is all about strategy—your long-term plans for scoring points—with somewhat limited player interaction. Normally I'm not a fan of this type of game, but I enjoyed Helios; the game is relatively short for that style of thing, there's no worries about runaway leaders (as it's not really an "economic engine" game), and it doesn't bog down into minute calculations or endless look-ahead. 

The down side is that there are really a lot of rules considering how short the game is, and it's also very abstract, considering how involved the game is. You want to grow, you want to build, you want to attract personalities, and these are all concepts that we understand on an instinctual level, but the details are arbitrary. Why do we get this bonus here, why that bonus there? Why do we get points for this tile being surrounded by empty space, why do we get points for that tile being surrounded by land? Of course any complex and well-balanced game struggles with this issue, but Helios's choice to completely sidestep any real-world rationale (even to the point of having the sun orbit the land instead of vice versa) perhaps limits the appeal to gamers only, and even then maybe only a specific type of gamer. 

Anyway, I think the game could really shine (no pun intended), but only if you have a group that is interested in replaying it and exploring different approaches. A one-off play will probably seem like more rules-learning effort than the game is worth.

Solid solitaire puzzle. Yes, it's for 2-4 players, but it lacks interaction and doesn't let you change anything once you've started. The strategys should be very straight which I don't like much and since there's not much interaction between the players, you can just go down your road.

Reminds me of Russian Railroads, but overall it's less fun. There are good ideas and it works well, but it couldn't convince me.

I was really impressed with this one. It looks like it's going to be a family game but there are some good decisions to be made and a good amount of forward planning is required to do well. And there are some interesting tradeoffs, in particular the balance between taking the action you want and taking the color tile you need towards the extra free actions. And it seems like there are multiple viable strategies and they're all interesting. My one concern would be that it ends up like Russian Railroads where once you've tried the 2 or 3 main strategies about once each there's not much draw to play the game again. But hopefully that's not actually true.

Good game. Pretty "point's salad" game but a lot of thought goes into planning moves for the entire game. First player does have an advantage grabbing extra abilities of the gods or whatever they are called, some are a lot more powerful than others and first come first serve. Manipulating the world, sun, and resources is a lot of fun.

Feld like only in that it's a point salad with multiple ways to get points.  I had a surprise (to me at least) win I think in part to getting enough mana 1st round to hire two of those game end characters that give points and hired a 2nd one after 2nd round (so I had 3 of the 8 in a 4 player game... not surprising last place the player only had hired one character)

Very interesting theme that is obviously quite pasted on. Great discussion after the game of "what if I..." moments. Gorgeous art. Not that complicated once you get moving. A little more variability probably wouldn't hurt it, but that's not too bad.

I like the sun mechanic and the options around scoring points by moving the sun faster/further or stopping to illuminate tiles.

The game lacks player interaction, and the limited amount that is there is of a form I don't care for. The action tile draft is chaotic and randomly rewards people bonus actions. It is player interaction done wrong. 

The specialist tiles create a very odd pacing to the game where mana is extraordinarily important in the early rounds so that you can gain these lucrative endgame points. The pool of specialists is quickly depleted and then mana is only good for points at the end of the game. This area of the game needs a lot of improvement. 

Overall the game is good, it just isn't good enough to see the table very often.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Midweight strategic Euro that could finish in an hour once players are up to speed. The playtime / rules explanation ratio is bad though as another half hour will be needed for the explanation.
Players will have 16 basic actions, which could be one of three main types: settle a tile, erect a building or sun movement. A few extra actions can be gained. The tiles produce resources when lit by the sun. Resources are needed for building. The buildings give special powers or VPs. A currency gained by buildings can be converted to "people" who will give extra VP's at game end. Nothing groundbreaking but a solidly developed gamer's game as can be expected from Hans im Glück.
I like the original sun movement mechanism which I haven't seen before and the relevant board play. I don't mind that it is mostly a multiplayer solitaire affair except for the people and VP tiles. But for my taste, it's too focussed on long-term strategy. With experience, it should be possible to "learn" one of the strategies and consistently win against new players with little need to adjust. Think Russian Railroads, Stone Age etc.

Gets credit for being an efficiency euro that doesn't feel like all the other efficiency euros out there. That being said, theres nothing to keep it from being stale once you figure it out. Its multiplayer solitaire with small elements of randomness that can't be mitigated as the only source of mixing up the strategy. 

There are some concerns with the other players getting the end game vp bonuses you wanted, but those have to be picked at the beginning of the game or you lose out on them. So any competitive strategy will be to rush for the best endgame bonuses, and then when that is sorted out turn to the strategy dictated by the bonuses you got. This gives an interesting little solitaire puzzle, but there probably isn't more than 2 or 3 games in this for me.

FIRST IMPRESSIONS:

I have some concerns about replayability and the game feeling fairly "samey" over time.  However, the game plays quickly and there appear to be at least several paths to points.  There is definitely some long term planning in play although you may have to change it up depending on other people's strategies and where you are in turn order. This is definitely one of those games where one wants to do far more than one is able to do and you will run out of time trying to do everything, best stick with 1-2 strategies and focus on those.   

SOLD after five plays.  Game play is interesting but was becoming rather scripted according to strategy pursued.

RATING: 8
The theme of this game, is a bit far fetched, but forgive me, I love this game. The circling sun is original, and the components look gorgeous. 

Some have argued that this game has a problem with replay ability, because the starting setup is always the same. 

But this game offers you a zillion ways to score points, and yet, you only have 16 simple actions (+ some extra actions) at your disposal (4x4 + maximum 4 extra actions).

The only thing that annoys me a bit is the race for person tiles. It is clear that you need them to win, and you need to get them in the beginning of the game, before someone else catches them. So the first few actions you will need to spend on manna. Not sure if it would be possible to completely ignore the person tiles and apply some other extreme strategy instead.

Having very few actions to do a lot, this game reminds me of the much lighter game [thing=40214][/thing].

If you like games with a lot of backstabbing and blocking interaction, than this game isn't for you. But I don't mind building things, that cannot be destroyed by others.  

Very interesting and original game mechanisms, gorgeous material and done in an hour !

Playing this game again after a few months, makes it necessary to reread the rules because they are not straightforward.

I really don't get the theme - the game is very-much an abstract-euro in that regard. Basically, you're trying to get points by creating cubes that allow you to build buildings that trigger special powers or temples that provide points and mana which allows you to attract dudes that give you end-game points. Or you can move the sun around what you've built and what it shines on grows more cubes or provides temple points and also scores when it makes a full-rotation. OK, the sun movement is cool but the rest just seems absurd.

Clever game with unique mechanisms. Everything is balanced interestingly. There appear to only be 2 or 3 strategies, which might be okay, but the game feels a bit scripted, especially after the initial land rush on the endgame scoring characters. I'm a bit bothered the way that goes down and multiple people have suggested a house rule to limit character hirings to one per round. I'm not convinced that is necessary (though I find it interesting) but more points to our lack of acceptance about how the game is supposed to be paced. Either way, while I'm intrigued by the game, I question its replayability and don't think I need to own it. I'd play it again, though.

This is a great euro, a deep one played in only 45 minutes. You have around 16-19 actions per game, and each one is an agonizing meaningful decision. The lack of replayability is often touted in the forums, which is somewhat true due to the same setup every time, the possibility of strategy in the game is very deep to provide some variability. I play with 2 players mostly and use the variant where only 4 character tiles are randomly used, and one can only hire once per round. This improves the replayability as you won't see all the tiles, and the one that is available forces you to tailor your strategy to it. Would love to see more character tiles for this game!

Okay game.  I thought about buying this but after seeing a play through thought that it would have limited replayability.  I was right....very little "different paths to victory" in this game.

Helios has quite a bit of game packed into such a short playing time.  There is a hexagonal map in front of you that you have to move your sun around to gain points and benefits, there is an individual player board with houses that grant abilities, and there are also special characters that you can recruit.

It all works surprisingly well together.  There are lots of opportunities for different strategies, and it is quite fun figuring out how to layout your map for optimal sun movement.

Medium euro with new original mechanics. It has several paths to victory, it's low in interaction and it's quite short, ending in about one hour.

It is horribly abstract and even if you can only choose one of three actions in each of your turns, it has a good deal of rules. Because of it, I think this is a game only fit for those who are willing to invest time exploring it with further plays. But on the other side, it doesn't seem to have enough variable elements and interaction to grant its replayability: once you've explored the different paths, you'll probably want to stick to your favorite strategy.

I don't feel very motivated to try it again, but I might, online.

RATING: 7
Paulo swore that I would like this game. And I don't know if it was my undying quest to prove him wrong or if this was just a middling game but the mechanics and gameplay felt muddled and clunky. Maybe too much emphasis was put on the art and components of the game (the shiny red "mana" stones and coins are the best). The rotating sun mechanic was an intriguing aspect of the game and, executed at the right time, could be a player's highest point-scorer. Helios may look simpler than it is and it plays relatively fast which may be one of the reasons why this game is called a "hidden gem" by many people. I could give it a second chance, but at the moment, Helios feels like a collection of mechanics with beautiful but distracting artwork.

A Euro with many scoring pathways to explore. With only 16 actions (plus some bonus actions), your strategy needs to be super-focused and on point, as those actions must be enough to get the resources you need, then to build what you need, and then to generate the effects that trigger your points. You don't want to be wasting actions, which means each game has the opportunity to explore a different pathway towards points generation. And each pathway offers different challenges on how to optimise your resource tableau as well. The rules are long-ish, because you also need to go through all the building and character effects for newbies to be able to build a strategy and compete, which is a downside and a barrier to entry. But once in, there seems to be a decent amount of play in this one.

Helios is a short resource gathering game with an intriguing "sun" mechanic.  You collect tiles and place them on your player board; when you move your sun token next to a tile it produces a resource.  The more tiles you collect, the longer it takes for your sun to go around your mass of tiles.  However, there are lots of incentives to keep adding more tiles, including getting a variety of resources, resource collection limits per tile, and bonus resources and points if you build out your land mass in certain ways.  You use the resources to erect buildings (printed on your player mat) that might give you points and other advantages like making your sun move faster.  You can also use your buildings to create mana, which is mostly used to recruit character tiles that provide end-game points.  Oddly, the game is structured such that the character tiles are all bought up in the first turn or two, making late-game mana not as exciting (it's only worth points).  I really like the whole sun mechanic, and the benefits and drawbacks of expanding your landmass.  However, it really seemed like the game was too short to fully explore how this might play out.  I really wish this had been implemented in a deeper game.

I need more plays of this game, but I can see it being a solid 8. A few paths to victory and heavier than the rules let on. The iconography is mostly intuitive, but it does require a bit of flipping through the rulebook the first time. Very little randomness in the game which worries me slightly, but I could see 10 plays of this game before it starts to get old.

Update: Way better with 3+ players. There is a lot of different paths to go and all seem viable. This game may bump up to a 9 with repeated plays. I'd like to try this with the full complement of players.

Update 2: Finally got in a play of 4 players and I have to say this game is highly underrated. Plenty to explore, doesn't slog and the bits are nice. Would love a small character expansion or something to help give the game a slightly random setup. Need more plays of it, but I'm tempted to bring this to a 9.

First of all: alone for artwork and the very high (German) quality of the components: big thumbs up, this is an example for all publishers for how to make an appealing boardgame. Also the rules are written very clearly, in literature, we would call this a pageturner.

The game itself: chose a path and try to stick to it as you don't have that many actions during an entire game. For a HiG-game it's quite heavy, but for being such a strategic game, it plays very fast.

Already looking forward to playing this again!

This game plays quickly, too quickly really. The game ends just as you feel like you've got your engine going.  The game has several paths to victory, but the paths intertwine enough that mid game you are still in a flexible enough position to change strategies. The components are really well done. The game gives you meaningful decisions with simple action choices. I had very high hopes for the future of this game, but it saw very little play after my first. I finally played it again and it didn't sing to me like it did a year before. I think there are more overall interesting engine builders in my collection at this point, that are more satisfying to play.

Nice looking game with smooth flow of turns. I really enjoy the sun revolution mechanic and building temples all over the place. I would love to see an expansion for this, since replay value seems low. I mostly worry about falling into the same strategies/patterns over and over again. Overall, Helios has a nice balance of building your own tableau and racing players for bonus actions and points. This game has tons of potential.

[i]I had to practice the game for the German Board Game Championship 2014, which explains my high number of plays.[/i]

Helios is a very strategic Euro with a rather short playing time of about an hour. The core is building a victory point engine out of buildings and temples on your map. Because of the shortness of the game (16 actions + 3-4 bonus actions) it is not easy to have still time left to run your engine, after it has been built. The very limited time horizon makes it even more strategic in my view. Additionally, there are almost no random elements (color of tiles which trigger bonus actions). It seems that quite a few strategies are valid (terrain heavy, temple heavy, small island happy-go-round). I like the spatial aspect in building your little fantasy realm and try to build "bays" in which the sun can shine on many tiles. 

The player interaction is reduced on selecting from a common display of actions and bonus tiles (persons) which support your strategy best. So this is a rather puzzly game and in that sense comparable to Russian Railroads: You do pretty much your own thing and hope that there is not much overlap between your and your opponents' strategies (otherwise you compete for the same actions/bonuses).

The production quality of Helios is extremely good. The art work of Dennis Lohausen is again very appealing, the card board is thick and I like the little wooden temples as well. As victory points are hidden, there are small linen bags in which you put your hard earned VP (which are cardboard coins of a nice shape).

Because of the little player interaction I have to wait and see if there is more replayability beyond trying a few different strategies. Due to Helios' limited play time this can be very well be played as a second game on a game night in case you still have appetite for something meatier than a filler game.

[i]Update[/i]: rating decreased from 6.5 to 6
After 10+ plays (actually even earlier) it became aparent that there are basically only two valid strategies. The one is grabbing the guy giving extra points for mana, building the cheaper temple building and then just build temples avoiding any sun movement. This is often beaten by the other strategy, which is building two temples such that both can simultaneously be shined upon from two spots. Then alternate sun movement between these two spots. Since there is so little player interaction, there is not much other players can do about this. The almost absent setup variation reduces this game to just executing one of the strategies which is kind of boring (Lewis&Clark has also very limited player interaction, but the different cards to draft always pose a new puzzle to solve every game). Helios certainly has only limited replayability. If players are about equally skilled, winning pretty much depends on who is lucky enough to get the fourth bonus action. Being 3rd or 4th in initial turn order also helps a lot.

I love this game but Christ...why does it have to have so many tiny and poorly-conceived components? The gummi treats are a nice touch for the mana but the action selection tiles are just a bizarre choice. Asymmetrical fronts but symmetrical backs, too hard to easily pick up, bump easily. Why not just a deck of cards? We may print our own if we keep playing the game enough. We replaced the sun and sun tracker tokens with glass beads and will probably replace the hideous money with something that looks better and a human hand can actually pick up. I'd also have preferred that the two separate player boards were combined into one but that would have changed the box size without folding boards. Overall we really enjoy the game at two players (more would be too long between turns) but it takes forever to set up and is a little frustrating to play because of the overflow of tiny pieces in a game that could really be presented more like Splendor.

On the face of it, this would seem to be my kind of game. But in my one play, it seemed the only thing that truly mattered was getting the most characters on the first turn. I went fourth in turn order on the first turn, and felt completely helpless the entire game. Not fun. Probly I played poorly, but I'm not interested enough in What Makes For Good Play In Helios to pursue another session. I probably should give it a  [bgcolor=#FF6699][s][color=#FF6699]-[/color][/s][b]3[/b][s][color=#FF6699]-[/color][/s][/bgcolor]  based on this assessment, but I'll hold off on that rating (which on my scale means "will not play again") on the unlikely chance that someone else's enthusiasm for the game would pull me into another play.

I wanted to like this game, because I liked the idea of the mechanism and the set-collection aspect of it. Unfortunately the actions don't feel balanced. The action which has the biggest connection to the game's theme (move sun) appears to be completely useless early in the game. Instead it feels like you HAVE to rush to get person-tiles for endgame scoring, else you won't have a chance to win. This results in a "scripted" early game - a thing i absolutely HATE. The lack of setup variablilty even enhances this problem.

It's a pretty solid collect-resources-and-convert-to-VP kind of game. It didn't feel particularly fresh, although sun mechanic seems pretty unique. It's another game I'd be happy to play, but don't need to own. Still, a solid game!

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
Setup: Action tiles are sorted by symbol (corresponding to Create Land, Build Temple/Building, or Move Sun actions). Reveal 6 of each symbol (in a column). Character Tiles (end-game VP) are placed nearby. Each player gets a personal board, with a bunch of hexes, a sun track, and a sun token, and also several buildings; and a bag to store VP tokens hidden; one of the basic tiles, with corresponding resource cube on it. Shuffle all remaining basic land tiles and reveal 4; also, the special tiles remain face up.

Each round, players 3 and 4 take 1 free raw material cube (place on starting tile).

Each turn (x4): take an Action tile (lowest in column), perform the action
- land = take an available tile and place on board adjacent to another tile
- build = pay resources (n cubes for nth temple) to build a temple onto one hex and collect n mana stones; or a building (specific cubes as displayed) on your board. Buildings give special powers, advance sun marker, endgame VP, etc.
- sun = move sun token clockwise around your cluster of tiles, up to distance on their sun track. Land tiles adjacent to sun produce resource (up to limit per tile). Temples adjacent to sun produce VP (1 + 1 per adjacent tile). Also, if sun completes full circuit around board, score 5VP. 
If you end up with 4 tiles of the same color, take a bonus action (but not another tile).

Next, players may buy and/or activate Character tiles: pay cost indicated, get whatever benefit is shown.

Finally, pass the start player marker and repeat above. After 4 rounds (4er game), score VP based on your lands (connecting to certain edge hexes are worth VP), buildings, character tiles, and remaining mana.

RATING: 6
This game has some really neat mechanics.  Each player controls a civilization represented by two boards.  One shows the land where different terrain tiles are placed and temples are built and the other shows a city of buildings waiting to be built.  Each turn a player takes one of 3 different action tiles.  These actions allow you to build, move the sun, or develop a new kind of terrain.  When you build you spend resources to place either a new temple on a terrain tile (which gives you points) or a new building (which gives many different bonuses).  Moving the sun around the terrain board makes terrain tiles reproduce goods as well as provides points.  And placing a terrain tile adds a new terrain tile to that board.

That's the majority of the game with a few ancillary rules.  The action tiles are color coded and collecting 4 of a color gets you a free extra wild action.  There are also assistants that can be hired and provide end game point bonuses based on certain criteria.

I think my favorite part of the game is the sun movement mechanics.  When the sun shines on different terrain they produce goods.  Each full resolution of the sun or the sun shining on a temple produces points.  There's a neat puzzle here on how you place your terrain tiles, when you build temples, and when and how you move the sun.  The game also looks great, everything from the artwork to the components is pretty good.

My problem with the game though is that it is an incredibly solitaire experience with almost no interaction.  Players do select action tiles from the same columns and the color matters in order to get that free extra action.  The terrain tiles are also limited to one each, each turn plus one random kind.  And finally there are only one of each kind of assistant.  But aside from this you play the game all on your own without any care or control over what your opponents are doing.  I tend to really dislike games like that.

The game also isn't that deep and varied.  The assistants and buildings are the same each game and don't do anything crazy.  Each game is going to play out very similar doing the same 3 actions over and over again.  This could get boring quick.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
It has some nice ideas. I enjoy the theme or, better said, the premiss of the game which is something like players are in a civilization that is able to control the sun's movement. That's a cool idea although the game is, in its essence, completely athematic when played.

A traditional eurogame with resources, movement and activation. The action selection mechanism with the color coded tiles works very well although it doesn't present an alternative to a player that isn't interested in performing an action. It should have that option because this way, sometimes, players simply stick for what they have available which may be only one tile (not a choice!).

Characters are awkwardly designed, not only because of the asymmetric scoring, with a few of them seeming much more interesting than others (opinion based on a single play) but mainly because, as a mechanism and game phase, they simply aren't enough or should be more expensive. There should exist a different balance between the number of characters versus what which one costs and the player's opportunity to get more mana. It felt very awkward to me as this is a game coming from Hans im Gluck, which is a company I really appreciate and usually doesn't publish games with this kind of balancing  issues. It may have been a designer's choice though, which I respect but, it would be a better game if all parts would work better through the whole game and through each player's turn.

Despite some of the 'problems' I see in the game it still is an interesting game.

RATING: 8
Z-Man Games’s Helios was just recently release in its English version and is a ton of fun! It’s one of those with plenty of paths to victory; as I count it, there are five primary methods of point accumulation with several combinations and variations (e.g., remaining materials cubes are normally not worth any points, but having the activated Treasurer character grants one point for each remaining cube). Gameplay is a blast with a good mix of independent and interactive style. The independent side allows for construction of your own buildings (each player has the same building options), building of land tiles in your own land area, and rotation of your own sun. The interactive, more competitive component entails a race to grab the right characters for your chosen strategy, competing for high-demand action tiles (and colors!), snatching the special bonus tiles, and grabbing the best land tiles to meet your needs.

Helios’s land tile placement with the sun rotation and “illumination” features is awesome! While you earn a single land cube when you build a piece of land, the most sustainable method of material collection is by “illuminating” an empty land tile. You start the game only able to rotate the sun two spaces. As you create buildings and activate characters, your sun rotation limit increases, thus allowing you to place the sun in the perfect spot to maximize resource replacement or accumulate extra points with the bonus tiles.

The building action allows you to build either a temple (that accumulates victory points when illuminated by the sun but doesn’t allow you to collect a material cube for the land tile on which it is placed!) or a city building. I tend to underestimate the power of the temples in racking up points. At first, I felt that buildings were longer-term strategic investments to be utilized as much as possible (most buildings also provide a nominal immediate benefit). Now, I balance the two (investing for future gains with the buildings while getting quick returns on investment with the temples).
 
The characters are a very fun component and can be game-changers with the amount of points they can bring in! You first need to “hire” a character with mana stones (accumulated by building temples or as a building bonus), but no benefit is provided for a “night-time” character. You have to pay three material cubes to “activate” the character and receive its immediate and/or long-term benefit. For example, the Princess gives you points valued at two times the number of the sun marker on the sun track at the end of the game (while others receive no points for this value). Also, the Treasurer (most expensive character) grants two victory points for every remaining raw materials cube and three points for each remaining mana stone at the end of the game. So, depending on your strategy, the characters can add a ton of value to your work. 

Overall, I give Helios an 8 (out of 10). I love the unique game mechanics, the boards and pieces are phenomenally sturdy, the artwork is fantastic, and the replay value is very high. Great job, Z-Man! Keep them coming!

Each player has a personal board containing a small "planet" made of hex-tiles, around which a sun token is moved. Tiles adjacent to the sun are illuminated, producing resources or (if a temple has been built there) victory points.

This part is novel and intriguing; unfortunately, the rest of the game attached to it is not. There are bonus spaces on where built terrain provides bonus resources, points, or "mana"; there's an auction for characters providing end-game scoring bonuses; each player also has a separate board for constructing upgrades. None of this frou-frou is engaging at all, and the upgrade board in particular is a missed opportunity for a shared board with actual interaction. 

Enjoyable and promising at first, I soured on this one [i]very[/i] quickly.

Wow, this game packs a punch. This is not a light game, yet it only takes about 45 to 60 minutes. Now I have to say that my first game gave me the feeling that it didn't go on for long enough for me to do what I wanted. But I've had the same feeling with other games in the past (most noticeable Race for the Galaxy) where that feeling went away after a couple of plays. And I do think this game does hold a decent amount of replay value.
I was kind of disappointed that you do need to buy the scoring bonus cards. During the explanation of the rules, it seemed like that was the obvious way to score big points. So I decided straight away that I wanted to see what I could do without them. The conclusion was that those bonuses are too big to ignore. But repeat plays could prove me wrong. I hope so.

I might not recall that I've played this six months from now; it was that kind of game. 

There are three actions available to you and everytime you have selected 4 matching colours, you get a bonus action.

Best thing: it *will* play in 45-60 minutes. It's an action selection/tile placement/building game. In each of 16-21 actions, you: place a tile, gaining a resource; move your sun, to activate tiles to gain more resources; or build a temple, either on the sun board for points or on your private city board, requiring resources and granting goods or powers. Many paths to points and no dominant strategy, that I see at this point.

RATING: 5
Saw this game played on one of Rahdo's videos and thought "that looks awesome!" but then his own negative view of the game, plus kind of a general negative vibe toward it, kept me from buying it.

Fast forward to it being on sale for $30 and I decided to grab a copy. Initial impressions are that I was right the first time: the game seems awesome. Sure it's another euro where you've got X actions to get X points and it's all about efficiency, but it does a very good job with the formula.

First of all, the presentation is excellent. The quality and look of the game are just great. The video made the game look kind of small-scale, so I was surprised that there was just a ton of stuff in the box. And there are some nice touches like a two-part dragon start-player marker (they could have just used any old token), every player board has different art on the back, and there are little bags to put your victory point tokens into instead of just flipping them face-down. Quality all around.

Then the gameplay. It has pretty much everything you would want in a euro: take actions, collect resources, build an engine, get points. A couple of things help separate this from similar games, however. First is a spatial element that is well-implemented. You have to really think about how to expand the territory on your player board because you can get points from having a lot of stuff, or you can get points from having not much stuff. Some tiles give you points by being close to certain other tiles. You also have to decide to build your territory in a way that gives you more points, or more resources. Plenty of decisions just in that part of the game.

The next thing that stands out is the fast-paced game-flow. On your turn you take one action. You have a choice between three actions. That's it. All of the actions are pretty straight-forward and the game moves pretty quickly because of it. There are still plenty of decisions about how to handle each of those actions, the game moves along once you know what you're doing.

The main criticisms seem to be that there is no player interaction and there is a lack of variety/replayability. I don't really get the player interaction complaint because if you enjoy euro games, you probably don't mind little to no interaction. That complaint is player-specific. The lack of variety could possibly be an issue after a few plays but I'll have to see for myself. It seems like there are at least three paths to victory, and you can mix them up as you see fit, so you should be able to get a good number of plays before getting burned out.

Feeling positive about this one, but my rating could go up or down with more plays.

Update: Not bad, but I just never want to play this over pretty much any other euro game.

Sold.

Familiar, multiple VP-generating mechanisms, reminding me a bit of castles of Burgundy except with a bit of extra clunkiness/fiddliness.

Nice Euro with some fresh ideas. The interaction between players is very limited. It has a little bit of a steep learning curve since you need to become familiar with characters and buildings.

Helios is a game that is weak on theme, but long on interesting gameplay. Thematically, we're high priests of a sun god... exploring the world, building cities and temples to the glory of WhatsHisName and calling upon his holy radiance to shine his favor on our lands. Or something like that.

The game is played over four rounds (in a four player game) and each round you get to take four actions (possibly more if you get bonus actions). You have two player boards. One shows your city and all the buildings you can build in it and the other shows the lands in your kingdom. There are three columns of action tiles, land, buildings and suns. Each column only has the one type of action in it, but the tiles vary in one of four colors. You can choose the bottommost tile in any column. Mostly you're wanting to get matching colors, because if you ever get four tiles of the same color, you turn them in for a bonus action.

The land action tiles let you add a land tile to your board. These either give you resources (which the sun can refill after you use them) or bonus points. There's also some bonuses on the board you achieve by covering the space with a land tile and some points you get by connecting to spaces on the edge of the board.

The building action lets you build a city building or a temple. The city buildings have various costs, give you various points and usually have a special cool ability. Temples cost 1 good for the first, 2 goods for the second, 3 goods for the third, etc. After building a temple on land it will produce points, not resources, when illuminated by the sun god.

The sun action lets you move the sun around the perimeter of your lands, giving you resources on the empty land tiles you end next to or points for the temples you land next to.

After everyone has taken four actions for the round, there's a special phase where you can buy some tiles that give points at the end of the game. These require mana to buy (which you get in various ways) and resources to activate. Each one scores points for different things you've done in the game and gives you a direction to head for.

There's a lot of ways to score points, but you'll probably want to pick a path and stick with it. Getting the right color tiles is important, as you could get 4 bonus actions in a game where there's only 16 actions in the entire game. The race to get the end of game bonus tiles is pretty fierce. There's a lot of points to be had there, so once you get those tiles, you'll want to make sure to maximize them as much as possible.

The game was a lot of fun, and there's definitely a lot more paths to victory than I originally thought. Everyone in our game went a different way and the top three players finished in a fairly tight pack (111-106-104-88). I was a little worried going in that one strategy was going to dominate, but clearly that was an unfounded fear.

Similar in feel to Castles of Burgundy: It has hexes, it is somewhat spatial, it is point salad. And on a first play, it's really quite good.

Not a bad game - nothing special, but perfectly fine - except for the Treasurer/Citadel combination. With those you can score far more points than seems possible any other way (over 200 if done properly). I won't actually play it again unless this is fixed. (Suggested fix, not tested at all: if you build the Citadel you only get 1 mana per temple.)

It was an OK experience, mostly because it was short, but I don't see this having more than 3-4 plays in it before I've seen all there is to see. The game is largely self absorbed, and once you pick a strategy there's little left to decide. The different colors of action tiles are supposed to introduce a tactical element but it hardly matters. The moving sun mechanic has its charm, but I would have been much more impressed if there was a single sun on a central board; each player having his own little board reinforces how much of a solitaire puzzle this is. Not my type of game, despite the modestly interesting spatial element.

some intricate but nice mechanics togheter with several already seen things. i quite agree with several people pointing out the sameness of the beginning of the game: some more variety would have been better. nicest thing, a lot of strategy toward victory.
after several games probably i will rise my rating.. so far it's an almost 7

We are alien high priests of a Sun God on a planet where the sun provides for all of our needs.  Set collection, civilization terraforming on round player area boards, and building upgrades provide for multiple victory paths. Unique mechanic where the sun "orbits" your realm and provides benefits to the adjacent tiles where it lands.  The priests can control the speed of the sun.  Hard for me to warm up to the theme (pardon the pun).  There are some fresh mechanics for strategy but not sure it's enough.

Initial rating based on 2P. It was surprisingly fun and I think it would be better with more players. I expect the rating may rise with repeated plays.

I'm glad to have pick this one up. Play's very well with 3 and you have only 6 actions (maybe 1 more) per round with 3 ppl and so many things to do.

It's a real point salade but for use a really fun one.

As with Russian Railroads this is not a game for me and i shouldn't play it in the first place, but i had a chance to play it and did, so i will rate it. It is just too much stuff poured into a game. And it doesn't connect with each other well. Of course, it is an euro style game and theme is not a strong part of it, but all the moving parts didn't click with me. I disliked the sun moving part and the hexagon board reminded me Castles of Burgundy a bit which i didn't like either. Picking cards to have some effects looked interesting, but they all look boring (both art style and effects). Not an engaging game at all.

Cute game! Fun, a little crunchy, about the same niche as Castles of Burgundy.  Not a lot of player interaction beyond resource and action denial, so it's a pure Euro with a lot of chrome in the box.

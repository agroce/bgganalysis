A truly tense and fun game that captures the frustrations and sudden lethality of WWII small unit tactics. The rules are a bit cryptic, as with many AH games, but go through the scenarios in order and play each till familiar and you will find a true classic!

I will play this anytime anywhere...Banzai expansion is a must. 

A few things keep it from a 10. Rules presentation, card cycling and the "stream" card mechanics...

RATING: 6
The hype is real.  This is one mighty fine game: a landmark in wargames and design.  But I do take it down a point because it partly rewards lucky card draws more than well-planned tactics, and [family=22797][/family] satiates me so well, that it knocks everything down a point.  But this is a game, I would gladly play again, given a chance, and much respect for a 30+ year old game that feels as fresh as this one.

Bought this in about 1985. Played it a lot back then. Less so since. It does have a few problems (which became more apparent with age), but it has so much goodness. Abstracting squad-leader was a beautiful idea which really worked, and I was never the same when it came to pushing counters around a board. Man on man, squad on squad you are unlikely to find a better WWII game in MHO.

RATING: 5
Tentative rating after four solo plays. I'll let what looks to be excessive chrome and vehicle rules (hell, the presence of vehicles in such a small scale game) knock this down a point from nine. Could crawl back up there but I'm not really sure. I don't like to rate games based on half the game even if I wanted this to be another 10.

I really like the elegance of the basic mechanics. Relative range, movement/terrain, the firepower based on range and the variety of fire cards are all great. Split cards to define national characteristics are clever and appreciated. 

I actually really like that the firepower increases with range. Not sure if it's realistic or not but it's a great mechanic and encourages interesting behavior. It's something that seems like it would be really fiddly to implement on a traditional map but it functions excellently with relative range.

The rally cards are a little bland, rallying men regardless of their courage, though it would be awful to get a whole squad locked down for multiple turns due to bad random numbers after you already hunted for a rally card. Update: Rally mechanics have grown on me after a few more plays.

I don't get quite the same charge out of this as Combat Commander but it's damn close and the fast play is really nice. 

Update: bumped to a nine from eight because I like it more than stuff I rated eight. I think one point is enough of a penalty for the dumb stuff in this game.  

another update: Digested more of the rules, read some articles from The General. My opinion of this game continues to improve. 

A major knock against this game is that it uses a shared deck. Like all single deck card games luck can essentially hand you a defeat even with excellent decision making, like if you draw the majority of the scenario's cower cards or if you can't find one of the rather limited rally cards in the deck. [-]Luckily it takes under an hour to play and frustrating defeats are usually even quicker than that. It can also lead to periods of inactivity for one player or the other but I'm rather tolerant to that due to how enjoyable the basic gameplay is.[/-] I had a 2.5 hour game recently and boy has it made me think twice about this.

Final update: Up Front is not the game I initially thought it was and desperately wanted it to be. It is not a quick-playing skirmish game, at least not 100% of the time. It should not be a single deck card game. Too often there are incredibly long breaks in the action because players are drawing the cards their opponent needs. Up Front is a 10 when the deck is plays nice with the players and a 1 when it doesn't. I find this quite upsetting because when it works it really, [i]really[/i] works. However I have no desire to play it at this point for fear of the dreaded 2+ hour game. This seriously needs a modern redesign but the grogs clutch it so closely to their chests I doubt any changes could be made. The rating of five will stand to show how conflicted this game makes me feel, a rough average of its highs and lows.

That's a kind of wistful 9, to be frank.  It used to be my very most favorite game ever, and then--and these are not precise matches--Memoir 44 and Combat Commander shoehorned it out.  But I still think it's a great game.  Why?

Uncertainty.  You hardly know anything.  It's a confusing battlefield, with your precise location in doubt, the going in doubt, you don't really know the tactical battlefield--and you're trying to create order out of it.

I stopped playing it mostly because CC and M44 were easier, also had useful chaos (especially CC), and the two new ones are a lot easier to play solitaire.  I traded it off--for a monster game on the Eastern Front, ironically--and I'll look back on it fondly as a formative moment in learning about what games could--and should--be.

No other game like it: a totally unique system that's a work of genius. And the only game that I give a '10' despite having not one but 3 Flaws:
1) the semi-auto M1 Garand rifle is no more effective than bolt action rifles.
2) American soldiers are inexplicably most susceptible to 'cowardice' -- is there a reason for this?!?
3) there is no provision for spotting an adversary who fires (with an increased chance of returning fire).

Bought the original back around 1985 and, although I was curious enough to buy it, I just didn't connect with the no-map concept and so set it aside.  Many years later I pulled it out again and then it all clicked with me and I learned I had one of the most fascinating wargames I had ever owned.  The fog of war and the command & control challenges make for an endlessly replayable game.  The rules can be challenging for a new player, so it is best learned with the help of experienced players.

I'm sure it was a great game on its day. It's easy to recognize the brilliancy of the design.
But today I'd rather be playing Combat Commander or Fighting Formations, which are more "rounded" designs.
And the lack of a proper map bugs me the same way it bugs me when I play Fields of Fire.
But it's  a game I'll play again with pleasure.

This "squad leader card game" is the best 2-player WWII game ever made; it will never be surpassed. Nothing comes close in terms of excitement level. If you can find it, buy it. Complexity is moderate to high (although you can play on a more basic level), but the time spent will be well worth it. I played more than 1,200 documented games of UF over 15 years, starting in 1983.

This older title is a descent game that could do with a reprint and a face-lift.  The game's design is sound and the game highly playable.  There is still a luck factor with the card draws but this serves more to make the game feel lighter and more playable than as a detractor.  Solid and enjoyable game. [GTI: TPCL]

Way too complicated rules book, but if you persevere, a brilliant game. Sales suffered from the game being about 10 yrs ahead of its time. Squad Leader in a card format and a precursor of GMT's 'Combat Commander'. Courtney Allen is a genius! If you want an ASL type game without setting up ASL, then this is a very similar feel.

For a card game, Up Front takes a bit of effort to get used to. Despite the large number of rules and exceptions, everything still flows together into a great game. More strikingly, Up Front still feels fresh and innovative even though it was made in the early to mid 80's. 

For the initial few plays of scenario A, you will not be playing Up Front correctly or with the full set of rules. Once you get more familiar with the system, the game shines. Turns are fast and moving your groups closer to the opposing groups is tense (please don't have a fire card or terrain card that can be used before I find cover). If an opponent decimates your best group due to lucky random number checks, you are left thinking about how you can make your movements with less risk, as opposed to simply blaming the luck of the cards. The design choice to use cards for everything is brilliant and adds meaningful variability to each play. You never know whether fire cards, movement cards or terrain cards will be scarce due to all the random number and position checks that cycle the deck. This causes some games to play out fast as the two groups directly attack each other. Other games can play much more slowly as the two groups battle from a distance while entrenched and at least one of the players waits to draw the needed smoke and movement cards (which might not come). Some may be turned off by the inherent luck of the draw that plays a part in the game, but I find good tactical play--and a knowledge of the cards--to be more important. Less luck of the draw would also reduce this game's variability, which is one of its strengths. This game is an achievement of multi-use cards that still plays brilliantly today.

A real wargame. Too complicated armour rules but a wargame that actually is so good it can single handedly destroy ANY Euro games in miles around thanks to its  mechanics.

It is baffling no one else covered it decently since 30 years.

Combat Commander tried by adding maps etc, but it failed on all accounts because it is the abstracted terrain and the HUGE number of info on a massive pile of cards that made UF so awesome for a 30+ year old game.

Recently took this game off the shelf and brushed off the dust to play again -- what a great game!  Its influence on card wargame design is increasingly apparent with time.

Anyone interested in tactical WWII games and/or card games should give Up Front a try.

Just as a kneejerk, I wanted to score it better, but I can't considering I have not played more than the first scenario.  I did play in a tourney the first time I learned the game, and was floored by the innovative and interesting gameplay I experienced as each opponent dismantled me systematically.  Really amazing game that I don't play enough, probably due to lack of willing opponents, or opponents I am willing to play with.  A classic.  If, and thats a BIG if, MMP published the remake of this game, I hope it captures everything the original has going for it, but makes it easier to learn and slightly smoother to play.

There are a few areas of the rules that take some getting used to (range chit interaction and the arcane "to-hit number" progression to name just two)

Precursor to the "hard" card-driven wargame, Up Front pits one squad against another in close-range combat. The worm's-eye view on the counters and cards gives players a different perspective on the action from almost any other tactical board or card game you can think of. It's a bit like the flip-book game Ace of Aces in this regard. A bit fiddly and fussy, experienced players can, however, slam through matches fairly quickly and, so long as a well-versed player is teaching, learning is not particularly difficult. The steals the game's wind is that it feels a bit as though fate has too large a hand in the proceedings, despite the abundance of chrome. Like GMT's Combat Commander, this is still no great problem so long as you find the random chrome believable.

First game played Germans vs Russians.  Very interesting game.  Luckily we had one of our gaming buddies, Jim Matt, teach the game.  Boy I saw the rule book and would not have liked to learn the game by reading the rules.  I will likely order one of the low levels from Kickstarter.

(Jan 1, 2013) Ordered from Kickstarter with all seven nationalities and all of the stretch rewards.

4/25/2013 - played a second session bumped the rating from 8 to 8.5.  I was the German army protecting a bunker.  I was doing a good job defending and thought I had the game going.  I thought I had won with only 1 card left on the draw pile (3 runs through the deck triggers the end game).  The US on their last turn killed one of the two remaining units and just missed on the last unit.  It was a very tense ending.  I'm just beginning to learn the game and can see why so many like this.

(> 200 plays) For me this fits the criteria for a definite ten very well: Outstanding. Always want to play and expect this will never change. Every game is different, you can play several games in a row and every single one will be different from the others, it is highly dynamic, the random numbers generator (the Random Numbers on the cards) works very well and the numbers are well distributed. I have played this game several hundred times now and I am still really enthusiastic about it.

Incredible game.  An interesting system that was at once way ahead of its time but still somewhat mired in complicated play.  The rulebook isn't as bad as advertised, but it is oddly phrased in many places.  Compared to modern card-based games, this one carries far more strategic and tactical decision making than most.

This is really an elegant game.  I like having the Squad Leader feel but being able to finish a game in an hour.  Plus for some reason I can really visualize squads of soldiers running between buildings and fields and up hills.  This game works very well.  

Rating lowered with intro of games like CoH and Combat Commander.

It's great to see this game back in print at a reasonable price!  Happy to have a copy of the base game with the errata-corrected cards.  Now, if only Wargame Vault could get permission to print the expansions, too.  Getting the entire game in my collection would be truly awesome and an epic acheivement.

A ground breaking, genre defining game as it was one of the first card games when it came out in 1983. Spawned a host of card games off it. Exciting, realistic, playable and rewarding to play. An excellent translation of squad leader to cards. Slight luck aspect but not that significant as the game is so enjoyable. Played countless games and still holds up today. One of the AH classics and one of my top 10 of all time games, a must have.

An absolutely classic game, utterly brilliant for 1983 (when it was first released); but now, it's just too complicated, has too many rules issues (I've played hundreds of times and there are still a couple sections - machine gun malfunctions are always the poster child - that I never quite got), and is much too fiddly compared to modern games. This is a game to which time has not been kind; in 1985, I'd have rated it a 10; in 1995, maybe an 8; now, around a 6. Still a solid classic game, but compared to modern classics like the Middle-Earth CCG (which borrows significantly) or various 2-player euros  it just doesn't come off well. Many subsequent wargames tried to borrow (Attack Sub, Down in Flames), but none managed to both keep the good stuff and discard the weak stuff.

As noted, the cover art is fairly horrendous (and what is it with the SS on box covers? See also Squad Leader).

Ahh, Up Front - I played this quite a lot back in the day. A fantastic departure from the standard wargames of it's time, being a card game with no fixed map. It did an excellent job of capturing the feel of an infantry engagement, with fog of war.

A few unusual game mechanics make this game difficult to initially pick up.  The rule book contains a lot of optional information or items not needed in many of the scenarios so the upside is that the rules do not need to be digested in one sitting.

I was used to play a game of this when the game session stopped early. The game is an hell of fun. The problem is that the game is way to complex for what it simulates and you always gotta play the same scenarios, since veichles are unplayable and you don't want to search the complex and obscure rulebook for exotic things.

There are very few games that I have played in my life where I felt like I was in the presence of something truly great, innovative, and utterly magnificent.  DUNE is one of them, SETTLERS OF CATAN is one of them, and UP FRONT is one of them.  As far as "pop" wargames go, Up Front is clearly the best of the genre and it is arguably one of the best games of _any_ genre ever published.  Why?  For one thing, the amount of atmosphere- a sense of time, place, and situation- is pretty much unparalleled.  Waiting for the right moment to move, being pinned down in a gully by enemies just waiting to blast you with an MG34, playing a cover-to-cover game of cat and mouse, laying supressing fire, and watching the tension loosen as you make a breakthrough are just some of the experiences even a basic rules game of Up Front will give you.  For another thing, the system itself is pure genius- a  lot of the bookeeping, CRTs, and other administrative issues common to wargames are transferred to multi-use cards, which of course we're pretty much used to in 2006 but in 1983 they were pretty cutting edge.  Thirdly, the game is just simply put- a lot of fun.  It's actually quite accessible and immediate even for the non-grognard and although the notoriously terrible rulebook does it a great disservice a little patience and committment to learning them in sequence pays off tremendously.  Some folks invariably will decry the amount of luck in the game- but unlike any other game, I think that luck is actually one of the chief factors in bringing the atmosphere to life.  Most firefights aren't always guns-a-blazin' affairs- there's usually a lot of waiting.  Not having the right cards simulates that pretty well- you can't get in a hurry and run without a concealment card or you might get blown away.  I'm really in kind of a shock about Up Front, I really can't believe how great it is and the fact that it is not currently available is an absolute crime against the gaming hobby.  With a few tweaks, an art update, and a rules revision this would be one of the best games on the market- it was in 1983, and it would be in 2006.  _That's_ a classic.

The best tactical WW2 combat game in existence (and that's saying alot).  More abstract than alot of people like, but quick, down and dirty.  Unlike other games in genre, no ability to be "godlike" and know all the conditions that one faces.  Being able to make quick and flexible decisions is primary in Up Front as it would be in real combat.  Needs a graphical update and additional nationalities, terrain, etc., but probably the game I have played the most over the last 22 years.

[b]An unequalled classic. This game rates "11". My favourite game.[/b]

Without any question Up Front is the most elegant WW2 skirmish/tactical wargame ever made. A revolutionary masterpiece that remains unmatched to this day. John McClintock says it best, "Innovation and genuine ground-breaking works are rare enough in any field. Truly revolutionary designs are rarer still. Up Front is just such a game, unmatched to this day for its sheer ingenuity, mastery of detail, and breathlessly exciting gameplay."

Captures the tension and terror, excitement, problems, fog of war, tactics, and theatres of WW2 tactical combat like very very few games that have ever come after. Creates exciting gameplay like no other wargames. Innovative design and simple mechanics still make this an utterly superb classic and a groundbreaking wargame even [b]34 years[/b] after it was first published.

Okay, granted, the rulebook is classic 1980s Avalon Hill legalize and filled to the brim with exceptions and missed opportunities for explanations, but with the re-written (fan) rules and numerous player's aids available the rules are nowhere near as hard as made out by some. My own cheat sheet from the original rules is still less than a page of typed notes. Absolutely worth the learning effort.

To summarize: This game makes me stand back in awe. Up Front is simply, in my mind, the finest wargame ever made, and it remains my favourite game of all time. I will be playing this until my last days.

P.S. I have 2,600+ undocumented plays over the past 34 years, and have completely worn out two previous copies of the game in those decades of playing. I now only record games that are somehow memorable these days (an unexpected rally and sniper attack for an unexpected win, a nail-bitingly close game with my son, a group that stumbles into wire or streams over and over again during the course of a scenario, etc), not every time I play, but on average I still manage to play 2-3 games per week.

Insanely tense game that is still groundbreaking and unique after more than 30 years.

Thankfully, there are player aids on the 'Geek that help despite having some errors, the game components include reminders, and the rulebook is easily referenced thanks to its index. 

Base game alone contains enough content and replayability to last a lifetime, but the Banzai expansion really enhances it.

Innovative game that remains playable today. Crying out for a reprint with some (not too much) streamlining of the rules and upgrading (quite a bit) of the components - also a better box cover please. It would be great if whatever package is brought out includes Brits, Japanese etc rather than having these as expansions as per the original AH release. MMP get a move on please - however, more importantly, get it right, so don't rush too much.

Valley Games somewhat unfortunately poached the rights for this then indulged in some dubious financial shenanigans after running a 'promise-the-earth' Kickstarter campaign. The whole affair is very shoddy, which is a shame for such a great game - even if the reprint ever sees the light of day from this bunch I won't be buying it or playing it in their edition.

It's similar to some card-driven wargames, but still a different animal.  Now that someone has taught me the game, maybe I can get through the rule book and teach others.

RATING: 9
Players maintain a squad of personality cards (troops) in groups of 2 to 4.  Using a very restricted hand of cards, they move and fire their squads and attempt to achieve the scenario victory conditions.  Not a counter and hexes wargame, but a very good one.  One the rulebook is absorbed, this is a very elegant and free flowing game.

[Allen] Wow. What a game. 
 
Never played one quite like it. Innovative, fun, hand-management game with a well-executed detail and chrome. Love to play it. 

In one sense it is genius, but you can see the rivets where Greenwood and AH staff bolted on useless stuff for the sake of complexity. That extra fat can really impede the fun and cause headaches for rusty players and newbies.

This has a lot of tactical depth for a card game.  At some basic level, it makes me think of a WWII version of Magic The Gathering, but with an entirely higher level of detail and chrome.   The multi-use of cards is particularly innovative if you consider this game came out in 1983.  That's way, way, way ahead of its time.   The basics of gameplay are pretty simple, if you can appreciate the abstractions of relative range and playing terrain cards onto an opponent.   The game seems to rush up to a certain level just short of victory, and then stall into a careful back-and-forth duel.   Getting 80% of the way there is easy, finishing the last 20%, though, takes 80% of the time.   The large number of scenarios gives it a lot of appeal too.   Easy to see why this is the card game of choice for wargamers.

I almost bought this game a hundred times back in the day. I'd pick it up off the shelf and try to convince myself to get it, but I was such a hex-and-chit gamer back then. And besides I had ASL to keep me plenty occupied. So I never got it, never tried it.

Upon my return to the hobby in 2008, one of the things I discover as that this is perhaps the greatest wargame EVAR made! So, naturally I'm curious about it. I finally ordered the version off Artscow that had the Osprey Books art before that was taken down. It's beautiful!

I made a big effort with the rules, even rewrote the basic rules into something more readable and got two friends to try it a few times.

While I'm certainly engaged by what's here, my timing was off. Soon after getting it, I hit a point in the hobby where I realized I'm making too much effort to try and maintain too many rulesets. Some games need constant play and this is one of them. Without a regular 2P gaming partner, I just don't see this one getting off the ground.

So, alas and alack, I've abandoned my effort to further learn and play this after only the first scenario. I put my exquisite version with some extras up for sale in the marketplace. And I won't look back when someone buys it.  This one will have to remain a mystery to me.

RATING: 10
I've actually played this game quite a few times, but only started logging plays here recently. I find this to be, by far, the best war game I've played. Every game I've played has been tension filled and interesting, even if it ended in a rout. I find the abstractions the game makes with terrain, wire, etc. to be brilliant (as well as the explanations of such in the rules). Whenever I have played Up Front, I've been able to get a clear visual image of what must be going on for each fire team on the board, almost like making a movie in my head. The way the game allows for the vagaries of small unit combat through its use of fire cards with different strength / use ratios (as I think of them) strikes me as ingenious. Sometimes a couple of riflemen get off a really good shot that does a lot of damage (so a 2 FP factor / 4 strength type of attack). Sometimes the whole LMG team opens up with devastating effect (10FP factor / 15 strength type attacks). As in combat, being caught in the open is dangerous, so if you're moving up, you'd better have a pretty good idea of where you'll end up hiding next. Even so, you'll sometimes run into unexpected obstacles (oh damn, this field is a muddy bog, I couldn't see that when I ordered the team to cross it to get to a stand of trees)! Then what do you do? You'd better hope one of your other teams can bail you out! Wait, you've only sent one team forward, the rest of the squad is just hanging back? That's not good, not good at all. 

In short, I love the way Up Front recreates squad level combat in WWII. It just meshes with everything I've read or seen about the time, it intuitively makes sense to me.

As for game balance, I think the designer made some brilliant decisions. The use of different hand management rules truly reflects the methods of the different nationalities. It's not perfect, but it works, and creates a very effective game balance. Even with the Italians, if you play your side well, you've always got a chance at victory, and will rarely get routed.

I've heard many people complain about the rules as being overly complex, and that always surprises me. I found them to be detailed and clear. The "programmed instruction" worked very well, in my view. Additionally, the designer notes include very thoughtful commentary about the way each nationality approached squad level combat, and explanations of how that was dealt with in game terms. Detailed breakdowns of the typical squad dispersement of each army are also very nice. 

Without a doubt, Up Front is my favorite board game of all time.

EDIT April 10, 2011:

This remains an unparalleled gaming experience for me. I've gotten way into ASL lately, which I'd have to say is a bit more fun for me, at least right now. I've also greatly expanded my war game library, so I see Up Front aging a bit. I still find it does what it does well better than anything else (lots of tension, compelling narrative, always a series of hard decisions, need to be flexible with your plans). I'm lucky to have met Brad and begun playing this pretty regularly. At some point we'll transition to something else I'm sure, And I'll still miss it...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Really fun and creative card game that plays in  under an hour.  It's great card game about WWII fire fights and one of my favorite squad level wargames.  The use of terrain cards instead of a board leaves just the right amount up to the imagination. The inclusion of so much weapon detail makes it feel 'real' despite its abstract qualities.  This is a fantastic week night wargame that spools up in detail if you want it to.  Lots to say here but I need to play it more....

And yes the rule book is long and wordy...  I can't put my finger on the complexity problem, but somehow the details of the rules just don't seem to stick easily in my head (causing lots of look ups).  Resolving different things, like tank combat or hand to hand combat, require you to read the cards in different ways which can be confusing.   It's not like there's one more rule to learn for something like a tank, you have to use the information on the cards in a completely new way and follow a series of new steps to figure out what happened.   In addition, there are many small things you have to remember only occasionally.  I had to write up a rules summary for the stuff that I could never remember and it helped quite a bit for me.  Now I love the game.

I like it more that Combat Commander Europe because firing is more effective and so the games go quicker.  Also as the sides move forward and close in on one another the weapon damage increases and scenarios end in a violent, accelerating fashion, which is exciting.  Not two or three hours of resolving shots that miss.  It's really streamlined and nice.

The game today suffers from a lack of player aids and charts to ease play.  It's very memory dependent.   Avalon Hill needed to spend more time on the presentation of the rules like they did with ASL.

And yes I paid a fortune to get a copy of it...But I'm very happy I did!  I have  two copies of everything as a backup, I doubt MMP will ever get it reprinted.  I think cleaning up the rulebook and removing the chits (which they talked about) is beyond them.

RATING: 7
You know all the session reports in the Up Front forums that read like an action movie where private so-and-so mans up to take out a whole pillbox with his army knife?  Well that's exactly what it's like to play Up Front.  There's something about all the individual characters and the way the cards are played that really let your mind go crazy.  

Unfortunately, there's just way too much of the game spent crapping your pants with discard, draw, discard, draw, and on to infinity.  This quickly becomes a no brainer, but there's so much of it, just the physical act becomes annoying.  

The other issue is that it just wasn't pushing any of the right buttons for me.  I rarely read strategy articles, but I wanted to like this game so bad, I thought I was missing something.  Then I read an article titled "playing your cards up front" or something similar that talked about much of the decision making process which included a lot of odds and card counting.  After that it was confirmed this just wasn't the game for me.  The story that comes out of the game just wasn't enough.

However, I recommend anyone who's remotely interested give it a try.  It's quite an amazing game.  A lot of the mechanics are unbelievable given the age of the game.  It seems way ahead of it's time.  Don't be too scared by the rules either.  They start you out step by step, though I must say, the more rules you have in this game, the richer your experience is going to be.

I don't ever actually suggest to play this game now that I've played it a few times, but I love the idea of the game so much I can't actually rate it poorly.

RATING: 7
Rating based on several plays, but only of the basic scenario "A Meeting of Patrols". Fairly chaotic but fun card-and-counter game. Doesn't show its age, and is still unique, at least among the card games I've played. Interested in getting into the later scenarios so we can break out the tanks and artillery. The rules as written are an unqualified nightmare, but if someone who knows the game teaches, then it's not so hard once you get past the abstractness. Looking forward to more plays of the advanced scenarios... *** UPDATE: I still like the game, but man, can they make it less fiddly when they do the reprint? C'mon Curt, where is it?

I know that many would disagree with me, but truly this is somewhat of a feeble attempt to integrate the squad leader system into a card game.  The rules are unclear, and the system of movement is very strange as it uses chips to represent a squad's relative location.  I would stick to regular Squad Leader.

This is the game that changed it all for me.

I started with AH Panzer Leader. Then played a ton of their hex and counter games. I subscribed to "The General". I wrote to Don Greenwood. I visited the AH ranch style house 'game development center' on a drive from a TDY that took me (sort of) close by. I drank the Kool-aid AND I LIKED IT.

And then Up Front came along. And it was weird. And the programmed rules were odd. And there was no map, no counters and no dice. And I found out what love is.

"Ultimate Fan Boy" is an over-used phrase these days, but I'll put that name sign on my Up Front desk proudly.

No you don't get to sit in lordly splendor viewing all your (and your opponents) dominions. No you can't sit with the calculator and CRT to assemble the perfect 'kill stacks'. No you can't even get your frickin' units to do what you, YOU the high and mighty! Or even to do anything some of the time. And it's a beautiful thing.

This game makes you deal with squad level combat realistically. You have imperfect knowledge, imperfect options and imperfect men. You have to make do. You have to improvise. You can't sit around for 3 years creating the perfect strategy, you've got to wing it.

My best gaming buddy is a retired Cold War era US Army major. He'd never heard of Up Front. I set it up. He wanted a map. He wanted a CRT. He wanted to know if he should find some dice. Then we started to play...

His reaction after the first deck, (and now I quote); "Jesus f-ing Christ! If only I could have had my lieutenants and sergeants playing this amazing game."

I see that it's being reprinted. Thank you gods of grognards. It deserves to be.

Don, Courtney, Dan and Maria, be proud of your masterpiece.

Ah, the game with a Teutonic SS trooper on the cover that I can't show in public.  One of the most innovative games ever made.  Command control is represented by limiting your actions to what available in your hand.  Uncertainty is represented by nasty surprises hiding in your opponents hand.  The result has the frantic feel of WW2 infantry combat as you try to move, rally, and coordinate your troops.  Fire and movement tactics are rewarded, and each nationality plays differently.  Cards also move through your hand at a rate that perfectly balances long-term planning and the demands of the current situation.  My main problem with the game is that so many extra rules are layered on top of the basic game that it starts to buckle.  Some of this can be avoided (don't play scenarios with night combat or wounds if you don't want to) or handled on a case-by-case basis (for scenarios with, say, minefields or artillery, look up the relevant rules before playing).  However, I feel the vehicle rules (and to lesser degree, infantry guns) greatly complicate the game while turning it from an infantry-centric game to one centered on stopping or supporting the vehicle.

A fantastic game, and it was designed almost twenty years before Combat Commander¡ The only war game in my collection so far the very best I have played. It is amazing how they built such a wonderful system with just a deck of one hundred cards. Game flows nicely and it is not hard to learn, but unforunately rules are messy and badly explained in the manual. Find a friend who know how to play it and you will enjoy this game for sure. This game needs a reprint asap, I think it would be an instant success.

If any game could make a 10 for me, this is it.  I just feel it is a little quirky "dancing" the Germans around to obtain extra cards because of the 1 discard limit.  But what a wonderful game with agonizing choices.  I'm always up for this one.  After playing it back to back with a scenario from Combat Commander, I'm raising my rating.  Up Front is more intense and more fun and feels less random.

I've played this game for three decades and haven't tired of it. Definitely worth the effort if you are interested in squad-level WWII infantry actions. It is my favorite game of all time, so it gets a rare "10" despite some cranky rules and the occasional blowout game generated by a bad run of cards (particularly early in the first deck as regards finding decent terrain). A real shame that the publication rights to this classic have fallen into the hands of clowns, scoundrels, and thieves.

Tried the first game over Vassal. Patrols clash. 

I had some fun in the beginning, but then it became a little too long: the enemy was positioned in two gullies, I fired too little or no effect for most of the game. I had split my squads into three, with two of my worst soldiers flanking. 

At the end they ended doing the more damage, surrounding the enemy and forcing it to flee, or die. 

I had positioned my LMG on a hill at the beginning of the game, thus I dominated all the area, one fortunate burst killed half the squad in one gully, giving me the game.

I didn't play with infiltration or other goodies, I guess the game's a lot faster with these, so I hope to be able to play with these soon! 

UPDATE
Brits against Krauts in a city fight, my paras ran over a wall in the open to reach a charred building and BOOM! Machine fire killed the sarge and the one near him! A blood bath. 

Ok, I guess I'm starting to like this game... 

I actually managed to win that game. Incredible. The last two german soldiers were killed in close combat. Go Brits, GO!

UPDATE 
Played the german pillbox on the beaches of Normandy against the assaulting americans. The americans didn't have a chance!

This game is becoming rapidly one of my favorites. 

UPDATE
Played a Rear Guard action, attacking Italians vs French in the Mediterranean Alps. Cool, I liked it, I'm bringing this to 8.5

I think this game's going to make it to the to 10 of my list. 

UPDATE
Played it again after a long lull. Action in Arnhem. The elite Waffen-SS, supported by a Stug-III, against the Red Devils in fortified positions. Wow what a game! We had many backs and forths. In the end the German won because of points. Basically, the Brits had to give ground, but also had made the Germans pay for every meter of advance. What a narrative! Bringing this to a "9".

Unless you have played other card based games in which relative position and movement are abstractly portrayed (which are all descendants of this game) you MUST have someone familiar with this game teach and explain the rules to you. After the rules are overcome (we won't say "mastered" since there are 25 year veteran fanatics still arguing about rules interpretations thanks to Don Greenwood's meddling to make the original game a Squad Leader adjunct) this is a tremendous game. More excitement to playing time than any other game including Wilderness War and Hannibal both of which I rated a 10. Well worth the expense to acquire and trouble to learn. Quit bitching aout eBay prices, that's the Free Market! Just work a week's OT and get it!

RATING: 10
One of the most innovative small unit wargames ever created. A novel system that blends elements of traditional counter/board based games with the randomness and fog of war of a card game, in a historically accurate simulation of squad and platoon level tactical engagements through fire and movement. A true gem of a game and fun fun to play. 

My copy, purchased in the mid 1980's, is weathered and worn nut still survivable more than 30 years later. Too bad it is out of print and that suitable official replacement editions have not been marketed to introduce and excellent system to a new generation of gamers. Instead we have a failed kickstart attempt, and must resort to other means, from scanned authorized expensive copies to design your own home made versions.

The absolute pearl of my collection. My son and I played it a lot. 
Includes 
Banzai (complete, unplayed and near mint)
Desert War (complete, unplayed and near mint)
"Hit the deck--then shuffle it: An introduction to UP FRONT by Jim Stahler"

All manuals are complete. The original manual has occasional highlights, underlining, and penned errata. All very readable.

Cards are in decent shape. No bends or folds. Normal loving use, though unplayed for the last 20 years.

A friend caught this one through an Internet acquaintance and it has proven to be an absolute blast. I could describe myself impressed: the tension and uncertainty is truly brilliant. Sometimes things get random and you lose through a lucky card draw, but with such a short playing time you can always rematch. 

Some clunkiness typical of games from the 1980´s is present but even with that, I consider UF to be a game that was ahead of its time. Being an old player of the Middle Earth CCG I can see that  some designers were impressed and influenced by its mechanics.

The rulebook is much maligned on the Internet, but in my opinion still very comprehensible if read only a section at a time and then testing the rules just learned a couple of times in a corresponding scenario. We managed to learn the game from it without too much hassle. Plus there is a really great synopsis of important rules concerning the first scenario available on BGG.

The game has partially reinvigorated my interest in tactical WW2 confrontations, causing me to seriously contemplate purchasing the first installment of ASLSK.

MTaught myself how to play this great game. Have yet to play against a real opponent and I am sure that I would get toasted really quickly when that happens. This is just such a great game and I really want to get more play out of it. I bought Frontline D-Day thinking it might scratch the same itch but it doesn't really. Up Front is much better but also so much harder to get in to due to the rule book. There is nothing really hard in the book it's just disorganised and not readily apparent what you should/can do at certain times. Great game to have though! 

Looking at this again after a few years on the shelf. Really want to get this to the table with some F2F games. Have spent the last week re-reading the rules and printing off some player aids too. Trying to get back up to speed on the game!

Have managed to get a copy of Banzai and Desert War expansions for this game during November. Now have the full set so can fight in whatever theatre I want to!

initial rating first scenario played only

FINALLY got to play this game due to the dense rules but boy does it play easy and fast once going (note I'm told the rules pile on the further you go).

Easy to see why people like it, its just a fun game and not a bad little sim in a way. It is pretty luck prone and I knew this going in so not a deal breaker for me, though less would sure have been nice, we played to completion in about 90 minutes though and I think that could easily be an hour with more play.  

Some Strategy there but with only 5 cards in hand roughly you are VERY limited and often just have to play to your cards. Definitely a keeper for me, a nice alternative to CC as it is much shorter and of course has a similiar feel though the board in CC really brings it all to frutation much nicer.

A very difficult rulebook masks an otherwise delightful game.  Best learned by having someone else show you how to play.  It has a very different (and, in my opinion, appropriate) feel for infantry warfare where you never know what is over the next hill. (since there's no map and you may end up in terrain you didn't intend to advance into)  Also, unlike other games at this level, the effectiveness of infantry weapons is undependable - you need a strong fire card *and* the firepower to use it.

I owned the basic game and the succeeding supplements.  For no good reason, I sold the lot on eBay.  Kinda wish I had them back.  I had played Squad Leader and ASL prior to giving this game a try almost twenty years ago.  Steve Ellis, a fellow BGG,  demonstrated the game to me.  The system was very smooth.  Quick setup and easy play are the strengths.  There's just the right amount of complexity to keep your interest.  I found that the tempo and the constantly changing environment (terrain) promoted a sense of the "first person" perspective for me. Squad Leader and ASL allowed more of a "God's eye view" of the battlefield.  I don't see Up Front as a competitor to SL/ASL.  Rather, they compliment each other.  When I desired just an infantry skirmish, I played a few rounds of Up Front.  Any scenario involving more than a squad per player, I would prefer SL/ASL.

I’ve only ever played this solo, which is not optimal since it is very definitely a two player game. And I found the rulebook poorly organised and hard to absorb, even for someone like me with a solid background in Squad Leader. 

These days, the novelty of the game is not so obvious, but when it came out, the fog of war had never been so well simulated in a card game. 

The game subjects almost everything to Murphy’s Law. The mechanics of the game and the absence of a board and make it impossible to know what terrain lies ahead of your infantry, and it’s not necessarily the case that your squad will actually use the weapons they are carrying.

A great game, that has aged reasonably well, that I am sure would be even greater if only I could find an opponent…

Up Front is a card-based wargame designed by Courtney F. Allen and orignally published by Avalon Hill in 1983.

This award winning game, referred to as the Squad Leader card game, provides an innovative game design for simulating squad level skirmishes. Its use of terrain cards in lieu of a board; its effective simulation of the Fog of War and of troop responsiveness (or lack thereof) to orders amid combat are all often cited innovative features. It is a non-CCG design.

My printed 2nd Edition copy from Wargame Vault:

With permission from rights-holder Hasbro (owner of Wizards of the Coast and Avalon Hill), Wargame Vault has digitally re-mastered the second edition of Up Front and is offering it again through their card printing program. 

This set of cards has been re-mastered to correct errors in the data of one of the original Personality cards, and also includes 19 new optional cards that can be substituted for some of the counters of the original game. They include 8 Relative Range substitute cards and 11 cards that can be substituted for Entrenched, Flank Fire, Encircled, Infiltrator and Crew.  These new cards are placed beneath the affected Personality cards and "peek out" from under them to display the appropriate information needed for that card.

Errata cards were added.

Still possibly unsurpassed for originality.

I think the complaints about the rules are overblown, but make no mistake -- this is a wargame and has that kind of rules density (I'd place it firmly in the middle-complexity level for wargames).   Like so many other games with unique systems, learning it is difficult, alleviated with help from an experienced player, but quite natural after investing a bit of playtime.  The game's a little lengthy, and after several playings becomes the card equivalent of a dice-fest unless the full rules are used.  The personality cards are flimsy (understandable for the time it was released, I suppose).  The picture I added to the database shows what they look like when laminated.  Yu-Gi-Oh size cardsleeves fit the action cards.  Rating docked a point because, unless played frequently,  the poorly-written rules make getting into the game unnecessarily difficult.

Another game I enjoyed so much that I bought a second set in case my first set wore out, and to play four-player scenarios.

What's good about this game is the mechanism of creating "fog of war" by allowing units to move and fight only if they draw the necessary cards.

At first this seems a mad idea to the traditional wargamer, but once you get used to it, it starts to seem a lot more realistic in in its interpretation of small unit combat than the big hex based games like Squad Leader.

Unlike Combat Commander, where you have that  Godlike view of the battlefield, I feel this game works better with cards. The luck of the draw kills Combat commander since you can see the enemy walking across the open field yet can't get the right cards to even fire. In Up Front since there is no map the illusion isn't destroyed like the above example.

THE definitive classic in the CDW (card-drive wargame) niche by which many newer/modern wargames are based/compared to.  Up Front is a design breakthrough in the card-drive, squad wargame.  

[But, as of early 2010, it looks like it's met it's match and I suspect that Frontline D-Day is a little bit better.]

Initially difficult to wrap one's head around the rules, it becomes much easier if you can have someone teach it to you.  I won't say I have it all figured out (I don't), but I do appreciate Jim Matt teaching me the basics and being able to play at scenario 1 now!  The game really is rather straightforward to play as long as you keep in mind your nationality restrictions/abilities.  One action per group per turn limit keeps it rather simple.  Luck of card draw will come in play at times, but you just need to be prepared that this can happen.

I've only played the introductory scenario of this game and need to read through additional rules in order to explore the more advanced scenarios but I've been a little underwhelmed by this classic so far.  It is an innovative system that gives an interesting abstract perspective on movement, terrain, combat, command problems and fog of war.  Ultimately, for the amount of complexity I would prefer to play a traditional wargame.

RATING: 8
After 3 plays involving infantry-only actions and wow, a very good game.  The rules are easier than I expected actually.  The random nature of combat depicted by cards seem to be more natural without a map than that in Combat Commander.   

Guess what, finally I got a game of this classic card game for Squad Leader. Before finishing the rules, Frederick taught me how to play the first 3 games involving infantry action only and it was a blast derivative of the Squad Leader world! As it stands on its own, it is also a very playable, easy to learn card game (well, at least before the overpowering tank actions introduced in the advanced rules).

Let me describe the gameplay as shortly as possible here. The game is for two players, one taking up the German, another one taking up the Russian or American. Each player is assigned the soldier cards according to the scenario instructions and divides them into groups, maximum four groups with a minimum of two men in each. The player is dealt with 5 cards (6 cards for the American). After the initial terrain card placed into the group, the group starts to move by the movement card before reaching the next terrain card. Different terrain cards give different modifiers to the firepower e.g. woods, buildings, while some terrain like stream affect movement or marsh which slows movement by requiring two movement cards to move out.

During fire, you count up the firepower at the relative range (adding up both sides' relative range number) of all the men in the group firing. You then play a fire card which has a number in the circle. The higher number requires more men in the firing and the firepower is stronger on the fire card. (You can play more than one fire card.) After modifying the firepower by the terrain, movement or concealment cards, the final fire strength is added to the number on the next random card drawn from the deck for each enemy soldier card. If the final total exceeds the enemy soldier card KIA number, he is killed. Otherwise, he is pinned. If he is already pinned, he gets a chance to either killed (the total final fire strength is smaller than his panic number) or rout (larger than his panic number).

On occasions, there are snipers coming up, weapons may go malfunction etc. In the heat of battle, you may also find a man of demolition sneaks into your own men by infiltration etc.  All this add up to the feel of the tactical combat situation.   

This is still a game of luck to some extent. But it is an excellent game design that truly captured the essence of Squad Leader in card play. While I am mentally challenged to the world of Squad Leader and Advanced Squad Leader and am unlikely to play a game or two, Up Front is a totally different tactical beautiful game to me. It can be played in a short amount of time, without all the hassles of the ASL drms and rules arguments. Yet, I feel I was there on the ground taking my men to accomplish the mission. Now, I regret when I was young I didn't buy this game because it said it was related to Squad Leader. I was wary of complex tactical level wargame back then.  As compensation, I can't wait to pull out my Frontline D-Day and read the rules in no time.

ahh...up front.  I tried to love you, I did.  But your awful graphic design, where I would have to sit and think everytime I played about what symbol meant what...made this a burden to play.  when we can pull out Combat Commander, or TOI and sit down and play in half the time (albeit with 2-3 times the playtime) its hard to argue for Up Front.   I may build my own set, because the up front redesign looks really good.

My favorite wargame (and its expansions).  My win/loss ratio must be 25%/75%.  I think the lack of complete control over your terrain and movement adds much to the game, as does the frustration that occurs when the enemy is moving so close, knowing you could wipe them out with one good Fire attack, and not having the right Fire cards.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Quick, easy to learn, tons of depth and replay ability, very cinematic. I'm glad I bought this! So far i have played the first two scenarios a couple times. I'm looking foward to digging into the vehicle rules.

I love the way movement and cover work together. This is the first game I've played were I really feel like I'm moving from cover to cover! I avoided infiltration and close combat at first because they looked complex but the system turned out to be both elegant and satisfying.

Luckily the game is really easy to setup and put away so have no excuses to keep from playing it more.

Update: haven't played this In a while so I dropped my rating. I still love this game but Ranger has replaced it. All the components and tracking make up front less immersive then ranger.

Update: it's very hard to find players for this long unsupported game. Hopefully the new kickstarter will revitalize this classic.

03/31/07 Played scenario #1, once. Basic impression... eh. I now feel "been there, done that" and I have no urge to return to this 1983 design. I did learn enough to know there's no way I'd ever bother with the complications of a great many of the advanced items (panzerfausts, mortars, flame throwers, demolition packs, pill boxes, night fighting, flares, smoke, heavy machine guns, infantry guns, tanks, armored cars, half tracks, anti-tank guns, etc.). The most basic infantry vs infantry fight was as complex as I cared to endure.

Such a fun game that friends of mine who don't even play wargames learned to play it against each other. I never really understood complaints about the rules -- it always seem straightforward to me. Maybe because I learned it when I was still in high school, and I had a lot more tolerance for rules back then. A tremendously fun 2 player game.

Edit: just looked into my copy of UF for the first time in years (lack of opponents), and I was amazed at how worn the rulebook and the deck of terrain/ action cards were. A good indicaton of how much I played the game.

This is a great game.  It's also a surprisingly good model of infantry minor tactics - in abstract sort of way.  Use the ground, keep a firm base and always use a balance of fire and manoeuvre.  It's not really too hard to understand the game system but it's different from "traditional" wargames so can take a little adjusting to.  Rule are quite well written and there is a fair bit of advice and help on the web.  Get a copy of this game if you can.

After playing numerous tactical wargames on a board, it was difficult to wrap my head around concepts such as "relative range," what the "wire" artificial terrain card represents and how the different fire groups are able to interact.  These obstacles are slowly being overcome and the system makes more and more sense with each additional play.  My game partner (and the game's owner) and I started with very few rules and have been adding additional rules with each play (to help make the basic concepts stick without overwhelming us).  The more I play it, the more I like it. (upgraded rating from 6 to 7).

This game is the granddaddy of CDG's. It stands up well to the test of time (especially with the revised rulebook here on BGG). If you've played any wargames with card play you'll see elements of them in this game from which they took inspiration. This comes with my highest recommendations. This game is fun.

RATING: 10
I have played this one more than 120 times. It's a very tense game which many times requires agonizing decisions and the result is often decided at the last minute. It's also very immersive. Especially when infiltration happens and the possibility for hand to hand combat comes into the horizon! 

Highly recommended.
Up Front is a proof that a simulation can be perfectly playable. 

In fact, now that I am thinking about it, this is my favorite game of all times.

Is that possible to play "Squad Leader" more realistic, more tense, in only one hour ? Yes it is: Play Up Front ! 
This card game insists on the two major parameters of war at this scale: fog of war and moral. The result is an incredible realistic and tense game. The rules are heavy but progressive. The more you master the rules and play, the more strategy replace luck. I have played more than one thousand games, and fun is still intact !

Players control a squad of men in WW II. There are objectives that you try to achieve, such as advancing on territory or causing your opponents to flee.  This is a card driven game, so firing is done by drawing cards to show how much total damage you do. 

It's a fun game, and I liked how each card was an individual personality, and your decisions were kind of tough about whether you wanted to advance or go into terrain. The rules are a bit difficult, and I had the benefit of playing with someone in the late 80s who knew the rules pretty well. There were so many little things such as machineguns jamming, or terrain modifiers. You had to check if your men got pinned and flipped cards for each personality so there was a lot of book keeping as well. 

I haven't actually played since the mid 80's, but I do remember this as being engaging and fun. I think the rules might present a challenge to get back into.

When I heard AH was discontinuing UF, I bought a second copy immediately.  They didn't have any of the original boxes so it came in a plain white box (which is fine by me as the original box art work has to be one of the most offensive game boxes ever made) -- still sitting above the garage, dry and unopened as my first copy is still quite playable.

RATING: 10
a squad leader card game that isn't at all like squad leader! in fact there is no board the ultimate gaming experience for intensity and for dealing (pun intended) with the vissicitudes of the struggle IF you like squad level war  there may be luck in this game but you always feel that your intelligence in decision making can overcome anything which is what makes this game great and because of the constantly changing situation you have to use your wits all the time but using them are central to the game the rules are excellent complicated only in the sense that making rules for this card driven game require exactitude and detailed explanation played 100s of times and never once was there a dull moment this game was way ahead of its time and my copy along with the banzai and desert war expansion has virtually turned to dust from overplay 20+ years ago

I will play Up Front anywhere, at any time.  A gem of a game that I picked up at a second-hand sale on a whim and been playing now for about six years along with the two expansions.  An absolute blast of a card game, plugs right into my fascination with small unit tactics and skirmish gaming.  I rate the two expansions the same as I see all three as the same game.

The amount of luck is in my opinion quite high (while using only the basic rules). This didn't matter me since it was fun to play. The touch wasn't of a true wargame but the gameplay was smooth and at some points even exciting.

I really look forward to playing more!

I really love this game.  If it didn't have so many chits I would have given this game an easy 9.  There is an opportunity that bad card draws can hamstring you early to the point you can't easily recover, but the game gives you some of the feel of squad based tactics without having 100 counters to play with.  I wish they had a 3 player variant that was viable.

After only reading rules for A and B.  This game lives up to its reputation.  The cards make it somewhat unpredictable, especially in comparison to ASL, but the speed of play and the breath of the coverage of the topic make this one one of my new favorites.  Update:  Now I've played C, and this is one of the most fun games I've ever played, so I'm bumping it up to a "10".  And I haven't even gotten to AFVs yet.  Another Update:  Played through the rules now, still a ten, can't wait for the next game.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
One of the greatest ever games, the perceived wisdom being that its relatively poor sales were hampered by Avalon Hill marketing it as the 'Squad Leader card game': this alienated anyone who didn't like SL, which is unfortunate as this is a game that oozes atmosphere and rewards use of 'realistic' tactical play. The original three forces (German, Russian, US) all play differently which adds to the variation.

The usual AH rulebook depth is partially mitigated by a gradual learning process, although the rules are still very comprehensive, dense even, compared to modern games. However, perseverance is amply rewarded as progression adds more weapons, tactics and even vehicles to the mix. The modules add further nationalities to the original three, the Japanese in particular being a completely different challenge.

Recently, I played this for the first time in a few years. We restricted ourselves to the initial rules only in order to cut down the amount of revising/learning, but I resolve to play more frequently in order to remember more rules and add the tactical depth and variation.

Provisional rating using very basic rules. Seemed like too many Concealment and Rally cards. Overall I'd much much rather play SL/ASL or about any other wargame. I'll give the rules another read and try again so the rating might go up.

Traded away unplayed. I taught myself how to play but realised that I wasn't going to find a willing opponent. The components don't make gameplay particularly easy (all those teeny-weeny tables printed on the cards...) and the game itself has no visual appeal whatsoever. I can overlook that sort of stuff quite happily but it makes the game a much harder "sell". 

I would consider getting a modern reprint (with improved components and graphic design) when/if that ever happens.

RATING: 8.5
Although it's been years--decades--since I played this game, it's a touchstone for me in many ways. It was the first wargame I ever played that used cards to represent the units involved, and I loved how personal that made the game feel, esp. in contrast to other squad-level games I'd played like Squad Leader, Sniper, Patrol.  The terrain your squad encounters and the distance between the opposing forces is represented by cards instead of on a map, which is unique and a little hard to conceptualize, but feels more authentic to the experience of leading a squad than the perfect knowledge of terrain experienced in those other map-based tactical games.  A real squad commander doesn't know what's on the other side of the trees up ahead, and neither will you when you play this game.  Love it.  Rules are a bit heavy, but still a great game.  As I said, I haven't played in a long time, but have downloaded the Vassal module and want to explore the possibility of online play.

The original 'Card Game' for me. I put squad leader down for a year or so and played this a few thousand times when it came out. Nothing was so portable, quick or evocative of tactical WWII combat. The games are always intense and gave a very good feel for real infantry tactics. Even now I am always willing to play this game.

RATING: 8
The most realistic war you'll wage with a deck of cards alone. Clever and sophisticated game, worthy of its praise -- and I'm not a wargamer by heart. Does not require the patience of a Yogi to understand, nor does it consume the usual time for a wargame (which is to say, all you could muster). Five squads will fight it out in an hour or so!

A wargame card game that even non-wargamers can enjoy. A unique and innovative game when it was released, and surprisingly realistic. As is the case with many card games, however, you are at the mercy of the cards: if you don't get the cards you need, when you need them, then all of the skill in the world won't prevent your defeat. This is why I rate Up Front as a "good" rather than a "great" game.

I discovered Up Front in 2003, 20 years after the release, and I was amazed to see how great is this game, even after all this time.
Fortunately, since it appeared 10 years before the collectible trend is not contaminated, it's a complete game by itself, all in one box (eventually expandible only with 2 add-ons,  Banzai   and 
 Desert war )
It's even better played in campaign mode: soldiers increase their skills and performances.
The VASSAL version is a masterpiece, highly recommended.

Lost $75 in the ks scam.

Still dreaming it could become true, maybe one day...

I dare say I'm completely in the minority here but this one left me cold. I'm not into Squad Leader particularly for a start but some of the processes that occur in this particular effort seem mind-boglingly stupid. At no time in playing this did I have any delusion of applying military/historical tactics - merely of manipulating a system. Terrain appears & dissappears, perhaps from another dimension etc etc. A lot of people love it though. Physical quality outstanding.

Finally got someone to teach me the game rather than slog through the rules cold.  Not that complex of a game at all and can see how its ideas have been used in subsequent games as well.

I definitely need to learn some more of the rules:  the experience of playing was really quite amazingly immersive and delightful.  I would love to play this again soon.

Squad Leader das Kartenspiel. If you've played SL / ASL the basic ideas will be familiar to you. The rulebook makes a simple game very difficult to learn. Like Magic, if you can get someone to teach you, the core rules are fairly simple, but the add ons can be quite complex.

Play time, balance etc all seem very good, but I think the terrain / range system is a bit clunky compared to wargames that use a map. Keen to try Combat Commmander and compare the two.

Finally got it to the table and it was far less overwhelming than I had been led to believe after reading the rules. ASL has the maps and freedom of choice, but let's leave ASL to one side because this isn't really worth comparing. Combat Commander has the maps, the improved squad leader influence area (but no vehicles), and introduces card management. Up Front dispenses with the map and cycles through the cards much faster than Combat Commander. There's fewer reasons to stop and check for random events. Less bookkeeping. More turns used just fishing for the right cards. It's quick and the cards actually do quite a good job of giving you a virtual map, but with a few surprises thrown in. Most of all it's just quick, fun and light.

Second edition, after a number of games we have worked out many of the wrinkles.  Horrendous box cover ( I hate that pastey faced worm...) with a rulebook that's tough to wade though and get straight, but what a PAYOFF!  I WISH I had picked this up years ago.  A card game with a wargame feel.  We added the Banzai and Desert War expansions, the more we get this game down, the more we love it!

UPDATE: Years after I picked this up, I keep coming back for more.  I still miss pouring over a map and AH really should have included new terrain cards with the expansions, however, this is still a fun, challenging, portable, tense, wargame. A true gem in my collection, now a 9.

UPDATE: Add the campaign rules and the 501 city fight in 4 scenario then soak in the magic! The strategic depths are bottomless! Managing your solders over time during different engagements, utilizing reinforcements, rotating rosters do to WIAs and KIAs, adding experience, and handing out promotions, gives the campaign game an X-COM feel in WW2. Watching one of your veterans cut down by a MG in a late scenario is absolutely heart breaking! This game just NEVER seems to get old!

Shrink from eBay + one ArtsCow copy and handmade counters.

A solid 8 after a few plays.  Then it just consumed my brain and climbed up to a 9.  Fantastic game.  A lot of interesting tactics possible in just the first two scenarios.  We've also only played Russian and German decks and only half the rules (no IGs, AFVs, campaign or solitaire or multi-player) -- I can easily see this rating a 10 soon.  

I see how it influenced Combat Commander now and I'm just so impressed.  This is a game that lives up to the "after-hype".  If you can get your hands on it, do so.

Simply amazing, but complex as all get-out.  A revolution in gaming.  Due to be disappointed by the 'new' version, if it ever comes out.

Squad Leader - the card game. A brilliantly innovative idea - probably improves on SL in some respects. For the grognard of the time it seemed a bit weird - I move my units and suddenly the opponent drops some wire on me - what's that about? The thing is we were all used to playing wargames with the perfect knowledge that our maps gave us - knowledge not available to the poor sucker doing the actual fighting. So - I rise up from my prone position and sprint for the cover of that wall I can see - but - oh dear! - there's some wire here that I wasn't able to see. This seemed to me so realistic of actual fighting and the confusion and fog of the battlefield. Superb game. Masterpiece of design.

'Get a friend to teach you the game.'

There. Now that I've said it, I can tell you that the hype is true. The game *looks* complex but delve a little deeper and you'll realise that the system not only has several euro-game elements but is also VERY tightly developed.

The fact that the cards drive the game allows for alot of smart and strange play at time. I like the feel of combat units under fire and movement. 

Can't wait for MMP version. For those of you who have a chance to play this, PLEASE do so.

[b]9.123:[/b] Although I usually don't award 10s simply because I only use a 5 point rating scale, I'm tempted to arrange an exception for this game and present it with a well-deserved 10 for its excellent game-play and unique design. [i]EXC:[/i] The cover art, however, is so disgusting and thus barring me from implementing this move. [i]NOTE:[/i] The person who crafted this forsooth despicable piece of "box cover" is to be freed from any guilt, because his design was simply a vengeanceful reaction to the decline of his first draft which only featured American soldiers. This move obviously did not fulfill its purpose, as the game sold well even in a time without the broad availability of online-reviews and where purchases were more frequently made on impulse (like cover art).

[b]10.1:[/b] The rules aren't really all that difficult to comprehend (Up Front rates a 4 on the 10-point AH/VG complexity scale), only when you spend too much time reading them, the language rubs off...

A neat card game system that gives a cool sense of geography while keeping it abstract.  Doomtown stole much from this game.  It is light and fun, but can get boring waiting to get an effectual turn.  Most of the game is "hand management", which seemingly presents an intriguing puzzle, but what it really boils down to is that you just wait for the right cards, use them and then hope to get lucky. After a while, if you can't do anything or if you are continually in effectual, tedium sets in.  I'm just not a big fan of games that rely on your endurance of boredom.

It took a while to learn how the basic system works, but it’s actually not so bad! Like it's descendent Combat Commander, you use the cards for pretty much everything (e.g., dice rolls, actions, terrain). The deck is also a game timer: the full game end when you cycle through the deck 3(?) times. Scenarios will give each side specific cards (soldiers, equipment, etc.) and setup information. You take turns taking (2?) actions with each of your squads trying to maneuver to within range, take cover, fire weapons, etc. Gunfire uses slightly confusing (too similar) terminology (firepower/fire strength? I can't even remember now) but in practice it works well. Fire can result in decreasing morale, panic, or an outright kill (harder to do). 

Cool game! Hand management is usually fun, and the game plays relatively quickly. Maybe I need to take another crack at reading these rules myself?

Simply excellent!
The most realist tactical wargame if you follow two rules:
.don't try to skip scenarios when learning the system. It's far better if you get to know the rules step by step.
.forget about "flying terrain" prejudices. When you play a Movement card, you're trying to reach a good position (such as that in a Terrain card you already have in hand) but there are risks. Opponent Terrain discard just means getting where you want is not so easy.

It is absolutely marvelous and still unmatched to this day.
There is so much variation in the game and yet so much predictable courses of events happen during a game. Strategy is very much rewarded and players who know how to employ the advantages of their squad (nationality, weaponry, group setup etc.) will beat their opponents most of the time.
I have won a couple of tournaments and still think that I am one of the better players in Germany.
The 501 City Fight scenario is my favourite.

Long periods of boredom, punctuated by moments of sheer terror

A fascinating game that creates amazing stories if you're willing to deal with the dated mechanisms and discard a card, draw a card 'hand management'. That wargamers love the torture (read: realism) that this mindless repetition captures so vividly shouldn't surprise me. 

There's plenty of interesting tactical choices and plenty of luck which adds to the drama but not the gameplay. No doubt there's better ways to mitigate luck than I found but it just can't hold a candle to modern game design. 

This game really needs a full reimplementation rather than a reprint and as such I'm pleased I cancelled my Kickstarter backing.

Reminds me too much of CC (although CC is inspired by UF), but you won't find here that much chaos. It's not what I like to see in a game (the occasional feeling of being played by it), but I want to keep going on with vehicles, which are next.

After 4 PBEM games, I'll keep playing this one face to face, that way I won't feel I'm investing that much time.

Back in '90 or so I logged a game of this practically every day. These days, it's not even clear that *I* remember how to play, and the manual does make teaching a barrier.

Understand that my rating is for the basic "meeting of patrols" scenario (well, and the occasional Scenario B or C). While I appreciate the fact that the game expands to all that other business, I find it too complicated. Whereas I've happily played "meeting of patrols" dozens of times.

Needs the [GAMEID=1573] expansion to be truly complete, though.

This is a tactical squad level game played by the use of cards. During game play your troops don't actually move, but counters keep track of how close you get to the enemy. There is a unique way in which players 'move' into terrain. It is also possible to flank an enemy.

The perfect card game for wargamers. 
There's an excellent Vassal module too.

All time favourite game, and even after hundreds of games with my brother, it always survived another 'oh my God we've been playing it wrong all this time' moment. Own 3 copies.

Rated 10 for me because of the theme, game play, ability to build your own scenarios ("501 City Fight" is fantastic), and nostalgia value. So I wouldn't expect everyone to feel the same, nor suggest people seek it out over later more streamlined modern war games. But Up Front has pride of place in my collection, even if it doesn't get played so much anymore.

RATING: 6
a preliminary rating of 7 after a couple of plays of the first scenario. For the age of this game it still manages to retain a uniqueness using the card to automate everything from movement/terrain to more specific actions. The first scenario starts off quite simple and obviously more layers of rules are added to each additional scenario thereafter. Which I think is probably a good thing. Also, it pays to pay the game to become proficient with some of the finer rules, but that really in my experience, is much like every other wargame I've played so far. I think if this game were to be reprinted however, it could be simplified further and strike a wider audience rather than the Squad leader Avalon Hill groupies of old. That aside, I still feel it's worthy of being in a game collection today.

This is by far the best squad level combat simulations out there (I play Ambush/ASL/MeM 44/and Panzer Gren as well).  Even at it age it still holds up very well.  If you can find a copy of this snap it up you will not be disappointed.  The rule book has a steap learning curve but there are some great rule summaries on this page which will greatly assist you getting right into a game.

If you inadvertently purchase this game, be sure to arrange for an indentured servant to be placed in your domicile to teach you the rules.  What a mess.

[i]Update[/i]:

I finally tried out this hall-of-famer with a UF aficionado.  I'm sure that someone can accurately point out the game's subtleties and deep mysteries, but the intro scenario has a distinct beer-and-pretzel flavor.

My present conclusion is that I don't regret trading away my unplayed copy years ago.  It's lighter than expected, and there's tons of other stuff that would be a better use of my time.

It also doesn't help that squad-level wargames don't really interest me.

This was the innovative game that showed me a game could be more realistic by being more abstract (fog of war). I would never play Star Fleet Battles or Battletech again...

Love it. This is truly a great game. The incredible thing is that I have only scratched the surface. There is so much more game here than I have even touched yet. My only gripe is the cards/art could use an overhaul... of course everyone that loves the game agrees that a reprint is much over due. But I am not holding my breath. People also complain about the rules. I have some issues with them as well and I made some early mistake ruleswise... but a few geek questions I was set straight and it started to come together.

Best game ever!  The rules are daunting because it's written in the typical Avalon Hill leagal script.  Once you get past that though, quick enjoyment from fire and maneuver. After you learn the basics, difficult but fun to master the finer techniquest, like using that sniper card on Armor.  Brilliant mechanic using the cards to randomize events and actions and the deck becomes the time counter.  Game measured in number of decks as you draw and discard cards.  Many strategies adn techniquest to outmaneuver adn outshoot your opponnants squad.

I love this game. It is really ungainly to learn and fiddly to operate, but once it gets going, boy it is a thrill ride. It is a great example of a game being much more than the sum of its parts. A true dueling game.

Fun. Not necessarily that realistic. Very early card game.

It was a while before I really appreciated this game. Throwing terrain in front of the enemy?!? It is interesting though. The basic formula is usually the same. Form your troops in three or four groups. A small force at the end, then a fire base and finally a maneuver group. In some variations.

06/20/07 - Ugh

For any of you who have actually played Squad Leader, you'll realize what an ambitious project it was turning it into a CARD GAME!!  The abstractions necessary to accomplish this were extraordinary, and Courtney Allen pulled it off, amazingly.  But the cost was too great, in my opinion.  Up Front begs to be much simpler; aside from the general complexity, most of the abstractions don't even make any sense unless you've played Squad Leader.  It's sad, because I feel that if they had let Up Front spread its own wings (by disassociating it from the Squad Leader franchise), it could have become one of the few timeless classics.  As it is, it's permanently crippled by modeling itself after an obsolete game that no one plays anymore.  Don't get me wrong - Up Front is an awesome accomplishment in game design, and I completely respect those that love it, but I don't, and I think most people will feel the same way.

Definetely one of the best simulation game ever designed.  Quick, exciting, skillful play is promised.  Somewhat abstract and needs some imagination to the players.  IMHO, AFV is too big for this system, thus I recommend scenario A,B,C,D.

RATING: N/A
Initial thoughts: Neat share based game, I enjoyed it more than the rules alluded to when I read them a month or so ago. I'd like to play it some more, but I'm not sure I'd buy it (at least not based on my 3p game). The decision space in regards to choice seemed to be centralized around which share to put up for auction next and cute ways of positioning other players to buy shares that don't really benefit them. Otherwise it seems like many decisions are sort of rote efficiency and it didn't seem difficult to predict what other players would do . Seems to exhibit some of the fragile nature that Container does in regards to player count and I'd like to see this at 5p because of it.

Fun game that's quick to pick up.  Lots of interesting choices and good flow.  Does not look pretty and it does take up lotsa of space but the compelling game play and quirky but simple rules works very well .  good economic game with a difference

A typical Winsome-feeling stock-holding train game, but without the map. Players do all the things you expect to do in these games: buying stock, and expanding the value of the train lines, in the hopes of cashing in on dividends while diluting other peoples' shares.

There are some neat twists here, such as the tableaus of cards you choose from, as what you choose will affect what cards are available to the next player. There are also some wrinkles to the share buying that I haven't seen in other games; primarily that it's not an auction format, which makes the game clip along more quickly.

However, we did run into the classic situation with these type of games, in that the end game is often full of uninteresting, or just plain bad, options, but less so than other games in this vein. We all want to play again, though, as it's hard to tell if the issues we ran into are a result of groupthink, or an actual issue with the game.

Overall, if you like this sort of game, it seems like this is a good one, distilled into a purely card-based format.

I have a natural dislike for stock games because for some reason I can never keep track of the money moving around between myself, the companies, the bank, and the other players. In this game you are buying stocks with whoever as the most being the president of that company. After everyone has a turn of buying stock you can then all assign routes to the companies which cost money from the company pot. Finally, at the end of each round the companies pay out in some crazy formula but always ensures the president gets the most. The math for such a simple card game was too much for me and I really had no clue what I was doing and lost by at least $1,000. It seems the only stock game I can understand is Airlines Europe.

Seems like a very solid shares game where the key questions are: how do you manage incentives by extorting and enticing other players while also managing the queuing of shares. And, then, also managing the queuing of cities which is more about turn order. Timing of the game ends doesn't seem to flex much, so it seems very much an issue of ensuring that you get good payoffs while dilution is low, get good terminal vale in the shares you have aplenty, and keeping the directorship at the end to get the rounding.

All around a very pleasant game - interesting but not totally opaque. And it plays quickly. Looking forward to more plays.

One play. Very good game that surprised me in terms of the ramifications of decisions made by players. That one play would be a 9, and I hope this game is a 9, but I have rated it an 8 as I fear that it might get samey over time. The surprise factor makes it one I certainly would like to play a few times more though.

If you are looking for 45 minutes of a competitive share-based business game with simple route expansion (via cards, not a map) then look no further.

In your turn you choose to buy one of up to five different shares, and then you get the chance to expand one of the companies you own shares for. That’s about it. Nice simple rules.

The decisions in North American Railways are tough: which share to buy, how much to offer for it, which city cards to buy to expand a railway, how to screw your opponents by buying a single share and then being able to undermine the company, and so on and on. 

It’s a well-developed stripped down business game which plays in 45 minutes, and with a lot to like.

RATING: 7
Components: good quality, colors of one Company does not match between cards and tokens
Complex: easy to learn, you need one point to understand
Weight: medium
Players: 4 or 5
Length: not more than 45 mins
Mechanics: buy stocks, build network
Decisions: not much but interesting ones
Opinion: curious economic game with a nice length. There are 5 companies, and you have to buy stock from them, looking for the greatest profit. In order to gain this, the Companies have to extend their network, so far so easy.
Buying stocks: you can only choose from the bottom row of a grid, if it is the first of that Company pay a high amount and become the president, if not the first, make an offer to the current president, and he can accept the buy or buy himself the asset. This is the first nice point of this game, first the president - the president is the one with more shares (nothing new here), but as soon as someone gets the same amount of shares than the current president, he becomes the new president-, and second, the election of what to buy, buying the first share is an easy option, buying some from an already "operating" Company takes you to the choice of which one should be profitable and how much will you offer, do you really want the share for you, or do you want the president to be out of money...
Building Network: each Company need to build a profitable network (money comes from the money each city added to this network provide), therefore you will like to add the highest ones, really familiar so far. Well, you can only choose from the bottom of a grid (like with the shares), then, the most interesting part, it is not the president deciding which city to buy, but any player with shares on that Company can decide to add one city to the network (while the Company has money to pay for it), so you can add cities looking for good profit, or just to slow the network of that Company. Regarding the cities, there are some cities with low profit but they will score high by the end of the game.
As said, lovely and interesting economic game, it can be played in less than 45 mins and has lot of interaction, the twist to the cities makes the game really interesting

This is a very clever stock investment game that plays in 45 minutes. Each turn you have a chance to buy 1 stock. Once all players have done that you take turns spending company money on city cards which give dividends each round and/or end game points to the share holders. It's extremely streamlined and plays smoothly.

The game is constantly presenting you with difficult decisions. Who to ally with and when. What are other players going to invest in. How can I edge out my opponents. In the end most money wins and every dollar matters.

One of the more interesting dynamics is when you want to buy a share for which an opponent is the director (has most shares). In that case you must offer them a price. If they accept you pay half the money to the company and half to the bank. If they refuse then they buy the share and pay half the money to the company and half to you. This really tweaks people's incentives, and can sometimes mean you get a good stock for a great price.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

We approached this one as a normal stock game. That's not recommended - this is a Sylvester game and one should approach his games with a different mindset. After one game, I'm still uncertain how to play this one but remain curious to try again. Seems expensive for what one receives in the box. Middling rating at this point just because it wasn't received well by the group with whom I played (experienced gamers) and it seems very player dependent in that one person can gift another the game (which happened in my first play which was admittedly a learning game).

Seems like a very nice design, the only randomness is in the setup and the selection of first player. I think it would benefit from a mechanism to balance a possible first player advantage (like e.g. auctioning the starting order).

This could be a Winsome game, feels just like one. Tough to play well – I agree on that. I need to play more, this is intriguing.

North American Railways - this is a pure stock market manipulation game with railway companies. Plays quickly (45 minutes) and does what is says on the tin. I would play it again but it is very dry

Spielworxx, Release July 2016

In the card game North American Railways, 3-5 players build railroads in the United States. They become directors of up to five different companies and try to acquire a majority of shares. In the end, the player with the most cash wins.

North American Railways is mechanically simple but very tough to play well.

Not sure. It's short, opaque, and the rules for buying shares aren't particularly intuitive. They seem to point toward a relatively interesting game, but it's one that defies intuition.

It's hard to make a good light stock game, and I do not think this one manages to do it. Turn order can give serious advantage if the set of available shares and cities are suitable.

This is an interesting stock game boiled down to as few extraneous elements as possible. I actually like the stock aspect in this one because it's so fast and streamlined (I have a tendency to dislike stock market simulations in my games), but it doesn't quite pull me in.

I'm appear to be in the minority, but I love this game.  Pure stock game, but I find the player interaction to be very satisfying.  It gives the same feeling as Ponzi Scheme where you are trying to exploit the financial position of your opponents.  I find it to be a lot of fun.

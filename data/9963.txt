Tentative rating based on single 3-player game...A nice quick abstract game for 2 or 3 players. Probably best as a 2 player unless all players are of equal skill. I think the God powers add longevity to the game as your tactics will change based on which God you've drawn. The Gods also provide a nice way of handicapping players of different skills as some Gods are clearly better than others.

My wife had difficulty visualizing the play of the game and, as a result, this will not get the number of playings with her I was hoping for. After more playings I suspect my rating will go up because I sense a great deal of depth to the game. I have not played it three player yet.

The base game is another 100% strategy abstract with the same initial set up every time. And its great! Among the best. But then you throw in the special ability cards and it flips the whole game around. These abilities don't just tweak the rules a bit, they redefine the whole game. This skyrockets both the replayability and the fun factor to make this a top notch game.

RATING: 7
Best abstract I've played (although I'd rather play ingenious with more than 2). Although it's an abstract there is a theme, and the theme is as integral to the game as some euros I've played - and it looks really nice. You could easily leave this game setup on your coffee table as a talking point.

** Update, my kids and gaming friends are less enthusiastic about abstracts and this sat unplayed for ages, now traded (with some regret).

RATING: 9
Santorini has a very smooth learning curve; new players can quickly get the hang of things, but there seems to be plenty of depth and clarity to keep the game interesting for a long time. The rules are very simple -- just move one of your two pawns and place a new tile next to that pawn, and the first to climb onto a tile three levels above the surface is the winner. Santorini games are fun, fast-playing and have a small footprint, making the game suitable for play in a restaurant or outdoors. The chunky white wooden pieces (75 square tiles, 10 hemispheres and 2 pawns in each of 3 shapes) are nice to handle, and the drawstring bag makes setting up and putting the game away a snap.

Several of our first games (without the god power cards) ended with the first player winning, but we couldn't find a reason that there should be an advantage to going either first or second. In fact, there is often an "Ah ha!" moment right at the end, and we end up playing several quick games back-to-back. Blocking, by either building stacks with two-steps differences, capping third-level tiles with hemispheres and/or putting your pawn in the way of your opponent's path to higher ground seems to be an important tactic. Additional games played both with and without the god power cards and with either two or three players, there didn't seem to be any advantage with respect to turn order. I have yet to play all of them, but the god power cards that I have played so far (Athena, Atlas, Hermes and Pan) seemed fairly well balanced.

Santorini is clearly related to (at least mechanically if not by decent) the Milton Bradley game Strata 5, and the variable god powers add a bit of Cosmic Encounter or Dune feel to the mix. So if you like either of those games, but are looking for something shorter, more portable and more friendly, then Santorini may be just the game for you.

I am Gordon's first partner for this game. In 1986 we played about 200 games without the godly powers and on a 4x4 board rather than the 5x5 board that is now standard. In December 2005, I started playing the game in its current version. 

The game is one of my favorites. Some things I like: It is easy to understand and get started, it quickly develops interesting scenarios, and I find it mentally challenging but in a relaxing rather than a stressful way. A wide range of ages in my extended family enjoyed it.  It is simple enough that my four-year old was able to learn it and really likes it.  Giving him a power and taking none myself makes for a fairly even match, so we can both enjoy playing together.

This just arrived at our house a couple days ago, and we've already played it a dozen times. Quick to explain and play. God power cards significantly alter strategy game-to-game. Backed from KS, so have 50 God cards. For a 2-player game, that's thousands of combinations!

RATING: 7
I've played this a few times in the faculty room in the middle school where I teach.  With each play I discover more strategy and tactics that need to be thought out.  Examples:  Should the center of the board be a blockade front or a battle ground?  Is isolating your opponents pieces beneficial or does it give him greater opportunities to block from the edges?  Should players start in the center and attack outward, or vice versa?  I look forward to this game getting an increased following and hearing some divergent viewpoints on this.

What a great game! An elegant abstract, easily on par with the standard benchmark in this area, which is of course the GIPF series.  It includes a fascinating basic game and also some godly expansions that add just an extra little bit to the replayability and variety.  How come this game isn't more widely known is a real mystery to me.  Truly a hidden gem.

RATING: 8.5
This abstract 2-3 player game has definite depth and substance to it.  The ever shrinking play area systematically limits players options while adding a tactical feel to the game.  A player must stay in close proximity to their opponents progression while developing their own objective.  The (optional) god cards, while adding theme to the game also add an amusing random element that further enhances replayability.  Santorini is a beautifully produced game made up of wooden tile components in a mesh draw-string bag.

RATING: 8
One of my most beautiful games. Simple rules and engaging play. This is not an incredibly brain-burning abstract, and I suspect two good players would frequently work themselves into a draw (but I can't verify that at the moment as I am not acquainted with two decent players...). But really, this game is a joy to behold, to handle, and to play.

RATING: 10
Raised to 10 from 9 - just getting the game out of the bag raises my heartbeat in anticipation.  Isn't that what games should do.

Highly recommended.  Over 20 games with the basic 2 player rules (no god cards) reveals a beautifully balanced abstract.  Difficult questions are asked on each move and the need for your pieces to work in tandem while still being close enough to your opponents pieces to frustrate their progress requires an alert mind.  A great game which should be brought to a wider audience.

4 games with the 3 player version (still no god cards) - surprised by how well it worked with players of equal strength.  Often a 3 player abstract is open to the possibility of a kingmaker however on two games the result came down to the last piece. The third player introduced a different dynamic, new questions and ensures that the game will come to the table more often.

Fun, quick game.  Seems like once players get the hang of it, whoever goes second is playing defense most of the game, and shouldn't win unless the first player blunders.  Also, while I like the disproportionate "god powers" in theory, in practice they are too unbalancing for this system.

Review: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/105873/divine-game
Read about my initial 3-player outing:
http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/91992

There are definitely interesting choices and tactics.  The gods cards present twists that should keep this game fresh.  The mental exercise is both challenging and aesthetically appealing.  Three players with gods powers is somewhat mind-bending to play in top form.  With two players and no gods (or the same gods for both players) the game is quite pure.  The godly powers are all interesting and every one seems `too powerful' while being fairly well-balanced against each other.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Played a few times, without the god cards, as Gord suggests. Found it enjoyable, if not especially deep. Obviously, the god cards are what bring you back to it, and even with just 8 cards there are 36 combinations, which is essentially a lot of admittedly similar but different games. (Both players can in fact choose the same god.) 

More gods can be downloaded or invented & printed, which makes it quite interesting -- [i]especially for kids[/i]. My 6-year-old loved this game, and stayed focused on it better than most games, because of the variety of god powers and how he was inspired to think up new ones (which were ridiculously strong).

So it's not going to replace something like a [gameid=27172] for me, but Santorini appeals for the experimental and creative aspects.

RATING: 10
I love this game; beautifully simple with a lot of depth, even without the god powers.  The powers are all very powerful, but seem surprisingly well balanced, considering their disparity.  

My rating is for the two-player game; as a three player game, it has more than its' fair share of kingmaker problems.  Not surprising; I find that few games of pure skill survive the addition of another player.  Your mileage may vary depending on the social contract of your group.  The author has a thread discussing this topic.

I may add ratings for different combinations of god powers as well, once I'm more familiar with them - you aren't just getting one game here, folks!

An interesting abstract that doesn't hit the table anywhere near as often as it deserves. The powers of the gods adds a nice extra dimension to the game. I have a beautiful homemade version (in tans and browns rather than white) built by my brother Tom. [7 plays]

I have only played a few times, two player only, and without the special powers. I will revise this review after I have more experience with the game. My first impression is that this is an innovative, interesting, and deep game that is a great deal of fun to play. I'm amazed at the utter simplicity of the rules and the depths of play. It is extremely appealing. I look forward to exploring the special powers, but I think the game is absolutely superb in its basic version.

RATING: 10
Tasteful, extremely refined abstract game in which two players have got to move two pieces and lay tiles on neighbouring fields on the board, to finally set a piece on a field three tiles high before the rival tops it with a dome. Territorial control and an effective use of both pieces are key to win.

I just can't believe no publisher has released this gem yet - a board with just the right dimensions, a mere handful of rules (I haven't tried the powers yet... maybe afraid of disturbing the precarious beauty of the basic game) and lots of depth. 

Add the whitewashed appeal of the wooden components and you get a treat for the mind and senses.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
This is one of the first games I have run across that is truly an abstract, but it feels trule themed.  The only thing that would give it more theme would be if the pieces that represented your men were Greek statues of some form and the tiles were double height with little windows carved in them to make them look a bit more Greek, but oddly enough it feels themed as it is.  The game itself would rate about a 6, but then you introduce the God cards.  That throws a huge twist as the God cards expose different powers that you play to utilize.  A very solid and enjoyable game.  I will be doing a review after a few more plays.

Light abstract that plays very quickly.

Aesthetically pleasing with its all white components.

It feels a lot like Cosmic Eidex or Cosmic Encounter with the special roles: Every pair of roles yields a different game. The roles chosen might be very unbalanced, but you won't know until you've finished your game. So even though I suspect the game is a bit strategically shallow, the role cards add a lot of playability to the game, and it's great to have a light abstract with lots of replayability.

An abstract game that has variable player powers.  The game's base on it's own is extremely elegant and replayable, but with variable player powers, the replayability of Santorini goes up exponentially.  It simultaneously feels modern, yet classic.

RATING: 6
A clean abstract game that plays quickly.  There is some interesting tactical maneuvering.  The early game can feel a bit arbitrary, since there isn't really a notion of ownership or territory and thus it's hard to lay the groundwork for progress later.  But the game is fast enough that you quickly get to more interesting stages.

The game is simple enough that I'm sure a simple computer algorithm could beat any human; that doesn't preclude it from being interesting, but it feels a little unsatisfying to just be testing brute look-ahead in a state space that becomes manage-ably small by the mid-game.  That's fine for casual play, but serious play should be done with a timer.

I'm not normally fan of abstract strategy games but "Santorini" is one I'll play.

You control 2 pawns. Each turn you move a pawn to an adjacent square, pawns can only move up one level higher than their current height, then drop a building adjacent to your pawn. Be the first to get to the the third height level and you win.

Simple to play but very tactical.

It is prone to a little bit of stalling as skilled players can nearly endlessly chase each other around ruining each others plans.

I found it more frustrating than fun.  It's an abstract, and once you get the basics down, the next thing you focus on is blocking your opponent's win, and I found this to be very frustrating.  The win usually goes to the player who makes the first big mistake.  I prefer games that reward clever play more than punish mistakes.

I'm not a fan of abstracts in general, but this is a good game.  A tight 5x5 board means it doesn't take too long.  Move a piece then place a tile - that's all there is to it.  But it's very deep, actually.  When you consider that you can only win as you move, this means your opponent will always have a turn to foil your winning tile placement - if they're in position.  Like many intense thinking games, we've found the game is won by the person who doesn't make a fatal error. 

As a bonus, my color-blind gaming buddy says this is the easiest game to figure out the pieces!

Maneuvering a man onto a third-level tier is only the obvious goal in Santorini. Hemming in the other player's pieces is the real challenge. But that's the trick, and the source of the game's wonderful tension. From a relatively small board there arises a game that feels like a three-dimensional race where you are always a move behind. When you do manage to win, there is a sense of relief and accomplishment. Recommended.

Bias notice:  I received a free copy of this game.

This is a great abstract strategy game.  This game comes with 5 God powers, and between the different God powers, there are about 36 different variations that you can play (God powers + atheist), making the game different during each play.

Stephen Tavener has made a Santorini module for Zillions of Games, which has been the primary way in which I have played the game.  Zillions is awful at some of the God powers, and very good at others.  If interested in the module, check the forums, he posted a link (the final module will probably be uploaded to zillions or BGG, but there are some kinks to be worked out).

I've only gotten a chance to play this a few times in person, but I think I like it best with 3.  Just play with rules that if you can stop someone from winning, you must; if both opponents will win on their next turn, you win (if you could stop the person after you, and that person could stop the third person, then this victory condition is not fulfilled).

Another abstract game that is fairly easy to learn, yet baffling at first, like GIPF. However, unlike GIPF, Santorini didn't have that same wide-open feeling, and felt a bit more constraining.

Gord's [i]Calculus[/i] was original, but this is a more accessible game.  An excellent abstract, which as a bonus, evokes a theme really well.  The only game to which it compares is [i]Taluva[/i], though [i]Santorini[/i] is much less forgiving, and more balanced.  I can see my father the mathematician and my brother the deep thinker both whipping me at this one for years to come.

Initial impression after a handful of games with young (6yr) and older players is excellent.

Further plays show great depth and interaction between players/gods.  Keeps getting better and better.

The stark whiteness of the pieces fit very well with the theme.

The basic rules are simple enough that younger players can easily grasp them, while the addition of the god cards brings some added depth to gameplay.

Too abstract - little gods and godesses would be better than cubes and prisms. Also, the wooden tiles slip & slide on top of one another so they are impossible to stack neatly.

I really enjoy the tricky maneuvering required to escalate yourself to the third story although you move before you build.  Also, the fact that everyone can follow the same rule-breaking god, or whomever they like, provides some exciting challenges in replay.

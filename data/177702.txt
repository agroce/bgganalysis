Although the card art is stellar, very little else stands out in this pedestrian bidding game. The card effects are uninteresting. The gimmick of knowing a card that is 'fake' can't really be leveraged in play and only allows for a snicker when an opponent over bids. Over all, unoffensive, but also rather dull.

Auction is one of my favorite mechanics, and this game presents them in a familiar, yet friendly way.  It has set collection with varied card effects that makes things tough to calculate.  Maybe one too many things going on, but it's still a tense ride in a small box.  I like it!

I think this game would be better with 4 players. The game itself is not bad with bidding (regular and blind) for cards that give points and other special effects. The writing on the cards is small and not always totally clear in its meaning. All in all, we had a good time with it but I'm not sure I'll seek it out again though I would play it again with the right group.

Initial Impressions:
-------------------------
Was interesting to try, and I wouldn't mind playing again, but I could see this one getting old kind of fast since you always play with the same cards.  Also, not sure the game really needed blind bidding with some of the cards?

Tetszett a játék. Csak is 5 játékossal érdekes, esetleg négy fő a szabályban lévő kondíciók miatt. Három főnél pont a lényegét veszti el. Ez egy licitálós játék, megspékelve egy pontozó rendszerrel és kártya kombinációk gyűjtésével. A végén pedig eldől, hogy jó kártyákat szerezett az ember, vagy sikerült egy semmit érő lapot jó drágán begyűjtenie. Nem sok újdonságot tapasztaltam, de mégis érdekes egy játék. A grafika szép, de nehezen átlátható mi is van rajta, pedig pont ez lenne a fontos. Ezt a játékot kivitelezhették volna szöveg mentesen jelekkel és akkor talán a nyelvfüggőség nem lenne annyira domináns, de azért hosszabb távon meg lehet jegyezni, ha sokat játszik vele az ember.

Officially played it just once. I think I'll enjoy it more as I play it more. 
Auction-bidding, set collection game, with a lot more "poker" to it than players realize. And I don't understand the gripes about the endgame Counterfeit reveals ruining the game. But while I like all aspects of the game, rules, and mechanics, there's still something missing about it all; I feel it's a good game, and that's it. I will continue playing it and introducing it to new people as a change-of-pace/something different though.

RATING: 6
Not bad, I enjoyed it alright when we played, but not really fond of the auction mechanic. I do like that you can't get too screwed over by running  low on money, as it trades around rather than disappearing, but still not a favorite. The set collection is interesting though, and I enjoy the historical and mythological artifacts as well.

RATING: 7
This is one of what is probably a vast number of games whose theme draws on Indiana Jones for inspiration; its unique claim to fame is that it's surely the only auction game amongst them! 

There's a number of tweaks and twists that ensure it departs from a vanilla auction in a number of ways: a closed economy (with some limited scope for inflation if you pawn your artifacts), with money passing to other players - which impacts on bidding tactics - and special powers, good and bad, for most of the artifacts - which makes valuation less straightforward - and the potential for a few of them to be fakes, with players knowing some of those that are - which again impacts on valuation and bidding.

All in all it's quite a nice combination, with a smattering of fairly typical Faudutti chaos mashed with a solid auction game which doesn't overstay its welcome. 

I should also say that it's all well made, with  a packed small box which only just accommodates the contents: nicely illustrated cards and chunkier player mats than strictly necessary. The 'ingots' also work well for the combination of standard and (occasional) 'in the fist' bidding. 

But what WERE they THINKING with the box illustration? Not one person in a thousand would guess what type of game it is based on the cover. And, though I appreciate that this is more a matter of personal taste, nor would more than one in a thousand want to play it after seeing the cover. 

It's hard to imagine how they came up with a cover this bad... "So what's the game about then?" | "Well, you're collecting legendary artifacts - Thor's hammer, Pandora's box, Excalibur ... that sort of thing" | "Brilliant, that gives the artists lots of scope, even for a small box" | "But they've all been stored in a warehouse, you know - like the end of Indiana Jones" | Even better, the artists will love an Indiana Jones connection" | "But it's OK... we already know what we want" | "Great, it's always good to start with a solid concept to anchor the illustration. It pins down the narrative; ...helps establish the story you want to tell" | "We want a door" | "A what?!" | "A really big door; the full size of the box lid" | "A WHAT???!!!" | "Oh yes... and can you make it look like it has Lego bricks randomly stuck on it?" | ...[whimpers]... |

The game ain't bad.  The insane amount of twists at the end is.  It is rarely the person who played to best who wins, and that really bothers me.  It has been pretty good for a game to teach to a group of younger kids though.  They don't mind the silliness so much.

Comment after 1 play.

Back in the day, I fell in love with the Warehouse 13 series, watched all of it and I do recommend it all over. I did not know there was a game with a similar theme until someone here on BGG mentioned it. It was cheap and available so I got it. 

[b]The theme[/b]: You could say that the theme is non-existent and the only thing it has in connection with the series are the crazy artifacts from all over human history. But that is fine with me as I wouldn't expect a game that takes 30-45 min to be overly thematic. Still, the artifacts are there and if you like various mythologies as I do, it gives bonus points :)

[b]The visuals[/b]: Simply amazing. The cards are made using a nice thick cardstock. The gold tokens are also thick. The artwork is over the top. 

[b]The fun[/b]: Well, this deffinitely delivered on the fun factor. Or at least it enticed a lot of emotions in the players :) There were multiple occasions when we laughed out loud. Also, one poor guy got really really angry (and he is usually very calm) when his plan didn't work out but at least in means he was really involved with the game, right? :)

[b]The gameplay[/b]: It is a nice little game connecting set-collection with bidding (both blind and open). It is very fast and everyone is involved at all times because there is always something you can do. The scoring mechanism is easy to grasp and the rules can be explained in like 2 mins. The various effects of the artifacts really spice up the game and can wildly change the outcome of it :) It is deffinitely more tactical than strategical. I was pleasantly surprised by lower luck factor than I expected. The only thing that kind of bothered me was the mechanism where you give bid money to the player to your left. Which in our case ended in a weird situation when I bought a lot of stuff but my neighbor didn't buy anything and was just hoarding the money, stalling the economics. But it somehow smoothed after a while so all was good again :)

This one has good theme and I really want to like it. As other reviews have noted there are some issues. I'm not sure about the "pay money to the player on the left" decision. Maybe variants will emerge that will give options to see if another method is preferable. It definitely generates a rhythm to the game but it feels too deterministic and predictable...maybe heavy handed? My bigger issue is with the significance of the relic powers...i don't feel their significance yet. Maybe i haven't gotten it yet but so far it feels like an afterthought. This is a pretty big absence because it's such a huge part of the theme. Comparing this to Fist of Dragonstones by the same designer...this one pales so far. In Fist, every moment is filled with compelling choices...which type of gold to bid with, how much, how much to save etc...then which character powers to get...which will be spoiled by the witch, etc...very rich and refined world of mechanics. This one feels like a lesser version of the same world where half the engine (the effects of the stuff we are bidding on) has been traded for a collection goal that isn't nearly as compelling. The counterfeit aspect is cool but again, feels a bit disjointed from the flow of the game.

RATING: 3
Simple game where one card is auctioned at a time and players compete for majorities in the various colors, similarly to "Biblios". I dislike that the winner of each auction pays the money to the player to his left, like in "Boomtown" (also from Faidutti), so that your income depends on the decisions of one single opponent. It would have been much better if it were like in "Dream Factory", with the money being divided equally among the other players. However, the counterfeits artifacts are what ultimately ruins the game. During setup, these cards are placed between the players, who can look at the two next to them. At the end, all are revealed, and the matching cards owned by the players are simply discarded before scoring, wrecking any strategy and easily deciding the winner. This might be acceptable in a ten-minute filler, but it's unforgivable in a game that takes several times that long.

pros:

--> Factice objects

cons:
--> I have some doubts about replayability because all cards are played on one game 
despite there are some factice objects that do not score at the end of the game. All cards effects are known on the first play.
--> Only 2 kind of bidding

This evil little auction game is lots of fun. When I played it I didn't even know it was co-designed by Bruno Faidutti whose designs I often find a bit too random, but I think this time his touch on Brazilian designers' work just added to the fun. Quite possibly the original prototype was more Knizian and good fun - an almost perfectly closed economy game with a funny twist (some of the items auctioned are counterfeited so they are worth nothing, but only some players might know about it - and it's really fun to share the knowledge with the player sitting next to you and seeing how your opponent bids high for something that is not good for anything). That would have already been enough for a good game, but Faidutti added his touch. To the auction he added that the winner gives the price to the player on his left, so you always have the choice: do I need the money offered or do I want to pay more? Also, adding his trademark special "magic" effects to the cards made the game more varied, interesting and fun. Well, I was rather impressed.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

I'd play again but probably wouldn't seek it out. Straight up auction game with some of the relics being auctioned having blessings or curses which help or hinder you. As well, there is an interesting counterfeit mechanic where you are aware of some counterfeit items but not all of them and so you are trying to deduce which ones are counterfeit in order to avoid them as they don't count for scoring purposes.

I thought I had pretty much played every type of auction game there was. Leave it to Bruno Faidutti to show me something new. The setting and artwork are great in this game where players are bidding on extremely rare and valuable relics that can be found in a government storage facility a'la Indiana Jones. Players are competing to get the most points in four different groups to score the points at the end of the game. One of the really interesting mechanics about the game is that the amount of money in the game is static and when you win a bid you give the money you spent on that item to the person on your left. This creates an interesting dynamic and choices when players choose what to bid and from what category to reveal cards to bid on at the start of the round. Overall it was a really enjoyable game, and I would love to play again, but with that being said it wasn't so good that I thought I should pick up a copy of my own.

The auction mechanic is fun, but the game can be thrown out of whack if one player doesn't spend money. This happened to us, and when it does the person to that players right will definitely win the game.

I really enjoyed this game until the end. The counterfeit cards throw a little too much randomness into the game for my tastes. You might think you have the highest amount of one color, but these cards can throw everything for a loop. The auctions and cards are cool, but the end game scoring ruins all of it. I vastly prefer Scoundrel Society, which, while mechanically very different, gives me a very similar feel.

Far too many open auctions drags this game down. The counterfeit cards just leave a bitter taste when they kill off your hard earned cards.

An interesting take on a simply biding mechanic.  I played only with 3 so there is a lot of info available with respect to counterfeiting.  The closed money system was also interesting.  The added decision of giving money to the left player can really push you to bid or hope money is coming your way.  There is also an added element of poker in this game as you don't want to give away what is counterfeit to players that aren't privy to the information.  the game is a little meatier than other pure auction games like For Sale and definitely  a different experience.  one big negitive is that the card stock is really bad some of the cards came damaged.  Luckily my copy came with two complete sets of cards so I was able to piece together a decent set of cards.  Overall, it's a very good auction game.

Only played once so far so this is probably going to change - art is awesome in this game. I cannot help but compare to For Sale, which is one of my groups fave games. The closed economy is unique as are the counterfeit items. This is a little more chaotic and random. I was poised to win until 3 of the 6 counterfeit items were mine (I knew 3 of them and owned none of those 3 at end). I created the 6th counterfeit item too. That being said there are ways to insure and change cards from being counterfeit. More play testing required but so far a solid 7,

A really nice filler in my opinion. I hear people complaining about the currency cycle mechanic where you give your money to the player to your left when you win an auction, and I honestly find the "it's not thematic and it's confusing" explanation for this dislike to be a bit silly. Sure, it's not thematic, but so what. It actually adds some depth to the game, as you find yourself in the position where you may want to bid an amount that helps you have the player to your right hand the ingots to you, and therefore be ready for the next auction with more bidding power. In a word, if it's fun, who cares if it's not thematic? 
The game's theme is... adorable. Just adorable. The art is stunning, especially for a game like this. My main complaint? The box. The plastic insert doesn't allow for sleeved cards to be fit in the box. I had to get rid of it and that's annoying. Publishers, when you make plastic inserts for your game components, PLEASE consider that people often put sleeves on their cards!

A real disappointment. I absolutely love the theme and Funforge continues to have fantastic production quality, but the game itself is just dull. An excessive amount of the playtime is spent waiting for the player to your right to buy something so you can finally get some money. You can only pawn items at 5 or fewer ingots, so if you end an auction at 6/7 you'll often find yourself stuck for several turns in a row. The counterfeit mechanic is interesting, but I just don't see the point in playing this when there are so many better auction games.

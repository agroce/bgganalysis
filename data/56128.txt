Preeliminary rating after one play. Nice theme and humorous art but I wonder whether there is any room here for some tactics to be implemented or that you just play everything you drew and see how it goes.

Fantastic game for 2 players. Looks good, plays great and is really cheap. The 2 factions are completely different and yet it is well balanced,the  gameplay is 15-25 minutes. Played this over 100 times in the last couple of months and had a ton of fun. Highly recommend to give this a try. Doesn't even take much space on the shelf.

A 2-player zombie card game. The theme works very well: as the human player you can feel a lot of pressure while the zombies approach your barricades. For the zombie player it seems a bit easier to play (i.e. there are not many difficult decisions to make) but overall the game seems quite balanced, as both sides manage to win and it's often very close.

I only wish there was more opportunity for hand management. With the small hand size you will most of the times play all your cards, so the biggest decision is is in the mandatory discard. It's seems it's rarely a good idea to keep a card for later, and thus there's no way to plan ahead.

There are some problems with the translation.

RATING: 4.5
Not a great game. The design is good insofar as the two decks are balanced nicely, making it hard to tell who will win until close to the last turn. But ultimately it seems like luck is the determining factor in the end: some cards are practically unstoppable, and one well-timed card placement close to the final turn can prove insurmountable. The rulebook is so bad that it is practically impossible to learn the game from reading it alone: it seems to me like the only way to figure out how to play the game is to actually play it. Card interactions are often hard to interpret.

I gave up after ~15 tries. Lot of fun but I found it quite unbalanced. It is actually very difficult to prevent zombies from achieving the barricade ;)

Fantastic game, abso loved it. It is a shame that it only plays 2 players. It captures the siege feel of a zombie novel effortlessly. The art on the cards isn't the best, and the one German language card that made it into the English edition is a bit of mystery, but other than that I can hardly fault it. Or at least I can look past it's faults. 
Buy it if you see it.

Pleasant 2-player game.  Similar to 'Zombiaki', but the rules are much cleaner and thus sheer pleasure from playing is increased.

The feeling of endless wave of zombies storming your barricade is more rare than in 'Zombiaki', but 'Zombiaki 2' makes up for it in other ways..  

Certainly worth playing.

I find it very well designed and decorated with amazing theme. The mechanics of the game fit the zombie march perfectly. But... I don't know why, it just doesn't give me much fun. I play it very rarely. But it's published as a small and cheap deck of cards, which I find great.

Good fun & simple 2 player game of asymmetric warfare that is well balanced... as any other game where I always lose to my wife :)

Maybe if there was more variety of cards? Than again with this move you could risk losing the balance of the game.

Highly recommended to play again & again in just a couple of minutes.

Dreadful rules,  even the clarifications on BGG do not clear up all the rules issues e.g. when movement is and is not possible, needs lots of examples, unsatisfactory ending, 1 card with German text rest in English, no humour.

Before you say anything, this is an Ignacy Trzewiczek so THAT'S why I have a zombie game. It is a dumb, not-translated-great, extremely random game that is also a bunch of fun. First game we played the Zombies crushed the Humans and it looked like the game was heavily weighted in their favor, but in the second game the Humans never gave an inch. It's easy to learn, plays quickly, and is full of laughs. Throw it into an order.

This game is silly fun. Has a very Plants vs Zombies vibe with how the zombie player is sending zombies down lanes to reach the human base, while the humans are attempting to hold out until dawn. The rules are a little unclear on a couple things, but I was able to figure everything out by the end of a practice session. This game isn't amazing or anything, but I think I'll hold onto it. For some trashy goodness, you could do far worse than this title.

Zombiaki 2 is a slightly modified version of game: Zombiaki. It's a nice game for two players. It does not offer much more than original game, as many cards are similar and the gameplay is identical. Still it's a good game for two and if you like game Zombiaki, it's good to have it, to change something.

Having both sets: Zombiaki & Zombiaki 2 allows four player games where two players play versus other two. The rules are described on publishers page (Portal). Unfortunatelly the rules seems to be not even close to balance both sides. Zombie players seems to be winning all the time as the combos you can made using both decks are very powerfull. It is even possible to move four intersections in one turn and simply win the game when no sign shows that something like this will happen. Especially that now you have the influence when some cards will be drawn. The cards from human deck, do not interwork with each other so there is no super combo available there.

Bardzo lubię tower defence, więc ta gra bardzo przypadła mi do gustu. Szanse na wygraną obu stron są dość wyrównane. Aczkolwiek jak każdy odrzucam karty: "Amerykański shit" oraz "Karta zastępcza", są one bezużyteczne.

I really enjoyed this, it's short, fun and easy to teach/play. Portable so perfect for a game over dinner. Best though is there are some very real tense moments, the balance of power in the game shifted often. Highly recommended.

Sequel to Zombiaki, a good thematic 2-player zombie card game. This new version is evolutionary, not revolutionary. The cards are larger and better quality.

We did the English translation.

I think I like the actual gameplay of the original Zombiaki more than the sequel. This one introduces some different zombies/abilities that just feel weirder to me somehow. But it does have the amusing "American Shit" card. :)

There is a lot of potential to this game. It's fun, it's funny, it's quick and easy... and yet there's a lot that could be better as well. Few situations are as infuriating as drawing the American Shit in a crucial moment, or having a Hive block the most demanding turns of the game... but it's still good enough that is sees the table pretty often.

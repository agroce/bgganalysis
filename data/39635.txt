I don't mind word games and this is a good game. The mechanisms and gameplay make sense. 

In our game bad plays dominated. The scoring was unintuitive. With more plays I'm sure things would have improved, but for my group a word game isn't something to practice for.

Highly enjoyable word game, very tense, with more room for creativity than most word games.  I'd have to call this my favorite word game now, if only because it always has me biting my nails.  Game length seems just right too.

I'm most fond of word games in which one can use long, interesting words. This is rarely true in such games as Boggle and Scrabble. It's very true in Prolix and Bananagrams.

I particularly like Prolix's scoring system - it rewards interruptions just enough to make them worthwhile on occasion, but not so much that players' turns are over before they've begun... by replacing one's own scores, the better one is at word-making, the higher the bar. Very elegant.

Intriguing word game.  Players have a platter of 8 consonants, none repeated, that they try and form a word from.  The quirk here is they can insert any letters they want into their word, but will only score for letters that are present on their platter.  Letters are also seeded in value - 4, 3 or 2 points, so you want to insert the 4 pointers at least.  Putting pressure on the player is the ability of other players to interrupt with a word of their own, which will score points, but at a -3 penalty - two interruptions and you lose your turn.  Highest points wins after a predetermined number of rounds.  Very good word game - nice sense of pressure, but you can't interrupt blindly as it may be a step backwards for you.  Well worth a look.

RATING: 7
Interesting word game, adds speed/tension (due to interrupts rule and timer) and removes the pain of memorizing 2-3 word lists like in Scrabble.  Main concept is to come up with words that use some of the point-scoring consonants on the game board, but you are not restricted to using those letters only!  Also works well with just 1 or 2 players.

Played with my favorite aunt and avid Scrabble player/Words with Friends fiend. It took her a while to get the hang of it.

A speed, party word game.  No chance of brain burning here since a timer can be started and another player can jump in on your turn with a word they see.

A great word game that is as simple in execution as Boggle and just as enjoyable.  A real brain burner but a light one and good with anyone who enjoys word games. Even though it is simple it was well thought-out and the rules really do support the merits of its design. I've enjoyed both the 2-player version as well as the 5-player!  A great addition to my very small word game collection (which will most likely stay small.)

One play with two and two plays with three. A fast, fun, and intense word game which has a big leg up on Scrabble, since it's not dependent on knowing obscure two-letter words, pulling the rare letters, or lucking into doubling opportunities. Also, the interrupts prevent the game from ever bogging down into endless thinkery. Rating could go up with more plays.

The only possible downside is that a player with a big vocabulary will probably trounce a weaker player every single time.

Prolix is a word game which rewards folks with a terrific vocabulary for using letters off the game board- and the letters change in value, and fall off to be replaced by other letters, so it's a changeable letter board.

Repeat letters will help you score big here, but it's clever use of the letters you can see which is critical.

Prolix also allows for a player to interrupt an opponent- which can change game order and help keep things interesting- but it penalizes over use of that ability as well.

It has a decent solo game scenario as well, but not fantastic- I found multi-player games with the family to be a lot more satisfying, and I'm sure that's how the game was intended to be played.

While they are not my absolute favorite, I do enjoy word games.  I do find though that they all feel pretty similar, and I was disappointed to find that Prolix did feel similar to other games (like Word on the Street).  I mean, there's not that much variation you could expect, and of course, the person with the better vocabulary will usually do better.

I do like the time pressure introduced by the interrupting mechanism.  This also keeps everyone involved.

I think this is the type of game that I would like if I simply played it more.  We'll see if we're able to make that happen.

I do dislike the size of the box - being kind of OCD about closing the box all the way, it is annoying that the box is packed so tightly.  There are so many games that have way too much box space, why not a little more for this one?

At BGG.CON 2011, Gil forced me to play this instead of going to sleep; although it's a tense, stressful game, subsequent plays of lesser word games (Quiddler, I'm lookin' at you) have made me want this.  (Yeah, I played Quiddler the other night, and won in part because I was pretty sure "Qi" was going to be in the Scrabble dictionary, which is [b]bogus.[/b]  While waiting for my turn, I found myself thinking, "well, it's no Prolix...")  Involving everyone in the game at once, but setting the bar higher for out-of-turn players, is genius.

My feelings about the graphic design of this game are best summarized as "aggressive hate."  [i]Hate,[/i] understand?  You guys took a great game and made it look [i]terrible.[/i]

LIKES:

* Solid spelling game for the family.  Plays quickly and the rules are well written.
* The solo game actually works well.
* Two player game is interesting and much more emphasizes direct head to head competition for each round whereas the multiplayer game is more focused on total points of the words over all the rounds.
* Interrupts for the 3+ player game looks interesting.

DISLIKES:

* Well, after reading further, Randy Cox's spoilers make me have concerns playing this game with extreme word experts, but this should be fun for the average joe speller.
* The bag for the tiles that comes with the game is ridiculously small and insufficient.  I replaced the bag immediately.

RATING: 8
Prolix is an attempt to design a word game that improves on the weaknesses of Scrabble and Boggle, and it succeeds nicely. Where most word games reward for making words only from the letters available, Prolix lets you score for any word, but you only score for the letters in your word that are currently available. This subtle change makes a world of difference.

While Prolix rewards knowledge of obscure words that cover unusual letter combinations, it does not operate in the fussy and weird niche of two- and three- letter words. This, alone, makes it better than standard word games to me. Instead, a strong general vocabulary, plus knowledge of some longer words that feature odd letter combinations, will win the day.

Like most word games that allow challenges, itâ€™s better to use a normal, and moderately-sized dictionary instead of a beast like the OED or an online dictionary. That discourages the study of bizarre, obscure words simply for the sake of gaining advantage. Instead, word games, properly used, can foster a healthy expansion of oneâ€™s vocabulary. In some ways, Prolix can do this even better than most, thanks to its more freeform nature.

Play-tested a largely finished product.  Excellent word game where players can use any word they come up with.  Your word scores based on letter chips out on the board and what their current values are.  Also, players can interrupt and score for themselves so it helps to be quick.  A simple, clean design that I think both hardcore and casual gamers will enjoy.

RATING: 8
Great word game, rewards those with a large vocabulary, but it is not as restricting as scrabble can be.  Very aggressive and tense, though, as your turn could be lost if you aren't on the ball.  The wife and I actually REALLY love the 2-player version that has the handicap. Very back and forth (but we are of approximately the same skill level).  A great game overall if you need to mix it up with the same ol' word games.

I will say that I'm not impressed with some of the components- namely the box and the bag to hold the letters. Unless you meticulously arrange the letters during cleanup, the box is just too small to hold everything. Also the bag is too small as well- the letters will fit in there, but you don't have room to shuffle them around or draw any except the top ones.  Really my only complaints with this game.

Wordgames which reward polysyllables are rare. Prolix encourages longer words rather than anagramming. There is a real sense of tension, as other players are encouraged to interrupt if they spot a high-scoring word. It is excellent - but turns can take a while. I recommend it, especially for people who like BuyWord or WYPS. Not so much for Boggle players, due to the long turns.

In this game, everyone is staring at a group of letters, trying to come up with a word that uses as many of them as possible (you can use other letters, you just don't get any points for them).  In that way, players are encouraged to use really big words to gobble up the letters.  This isn't a strictly simultaneous game, as players have turns, but other players can "interrupt" the current player at a penalty.  I do like word games, and appreciate being able to use monster words rarely used in the genre.  The time pressure was somewhat stressful though, as if you're interrupted twice on your turn, you lose it.

A pretty fun word game that might be too open and free in its rules. I'm sure if there were no house rules in place people would continue to use the same words every game that use all the letters to score high amounts of points.

However, with the right people this game is quite fun and enjoyable.

RATING: 6
I suspect this game is pretty good with more than 2 players, but the 2-player rules seem tacked on and they are underwhelming to say the least.  Without the interrupts, I don't see much game here.  So, as a 2-player affair, I generously rate it a 6.  If I ever get an opportunity to play with more, I suspect its rating to rise significantly.  Update: played with 5 and it was OK.  A little frantic, in terms of mechanics of fiddling with tiles and such.  Much, much tougher than play-by-forum on BGG.

I've been watching Gil haul his Prolix prototype around for years at conventions, and now it's finally available for purchase. (It's the only game I bought at BGGcon this year.)  

It's a truly different type of word game, which is pretty remarkable given the number of word games on the market. The aspect of thinking of words that include certain letters and not having to use every letter in a group like Scrabble makes you reach for longer words that had previously been irrelevant in board games. Gameplay is short, concise, and fun.

RATING: 5.5
1 play, 2er. Probably better with more?

[b]--- Game Summary ---[/b]
2-player rules (multiplayer games take turns, and you can interrupt another player if you have a better word)

The board is a 4x2 grid in which you place randomly drawn letters, 1/space. The letters in each column are each worth 4, 3, 2, and 2 points. At the end of each round, you slide everything 1 space right (2 letters removed) and add 2 more letters to the far left column.

Each round, players try to think of a word using as many of the letters on display as possible. When you have one, write it down and flip the timer for the other player; they have that much time (45sec?) to come up with their own word. Then, you both figure out how many points your words are worth (subtracting any handicap), and get a MARK if yours is higher. The handicap is applied to whoever has more MARKS, and equals the difference in marks -- so, not a big handicap in relation to most words you'll be playing. The first player to get to 5 MARKS wins.

[b]--- Comments ---[/b]
It's an interesting twist on the usual word game: here, you're rewarded for coming up with long words instead of short ones, and you're free to use whatever letters you want (in addition to the ones on display) rather than working with just a limited pool. It seems likely that the stronger player will clearly dominate the game -- best to play only with people of similar skill levels (unless you apply a much bigger handicap).

The 2-player game was just OK: you sit and stare for a while, then jot down a word, then compare scores. I suspect the multiplayer game, where there is more interaction thanks to the interrupts, might be more fun.

RATING: 6
Players try to construct words containing the eight letters drawn from the bag (and as many other letters as they want, but only those on the board are worth points).

There are different variants included for different numbers of players. The solitaire game just requires maintaining a cumulative score equal to approximately 18 points per word; in the two player game, both players look at the same words simultaneously. With more, a player's turn can be interrupted by another who sees a good word, but they will also be penalized for the interruption -- it might be better to keep your mouth shut.

It works well, and it's an unusual delight to see more sesquipedalian verbiage in this type of game.

RATING: 7
Games with simultaneous action generally make me too nervous to enjoy, but this one was fun despite that.  You just have to learn to interrupt when you know you have a high-scoring word and never let the timer run out without saying something.

Sounds more like a medicine or porn flick than a game.

Granted,  creating a word game can be an iffy proposition - but like an ill timed case of flatulence - this one can cause embarrassment in it's restrictive simplicity,  for both the competitive wordsmith and most especially for true word aficionados.

In some instances - which are rarer than the birth of albino twins - you may actually experience the euphoria of creating words that differ from your opponent.  In between those epic moments,  it is likely that all you will be feeling is a sense of bewilderment and a deep pang of regret - that you didn't have the foresight to simply choose something else to play.

Playtested this at BGG.Con '09, after wanting to try it the last three years.  It's a word game that rewards really big words, or at least short words that use a lot of letters that are on the board.  It's about time there was a word game that had a solitaire option.  I played two solitaire games and got to teach two 3-player games to Zefquaavius and his wife who just happened by.

This is a fast-paced interactive word game with a unique structure, keeping everyone involved and letting players catch up if they find fantastic words. The better word finder/puzzler would almost definitely win, except that the strategy in interrupting keeps it interesting. 2-player is good against an equally matched opponent, but even the handicap doesn't let a weaker player have a strong chance.

Scrabblesque, but unique. This works well in the two player version and the group version can easily be played while holding a baby. That's a big win in my book. Still, it's a lexical game and requires a specific skill. It's a fun one to have on the shelf, but I doubt it'll get a lot of play.

This game is awesome and I've only played it via Play By Forum. I must own this soon.

Edit: I finally have a copy and I can say that it is as fun face-to-face as online. I have only played 2-player, but look forward to playing multiplayer.

Most word games aren't that mean. I think this one could get really nasty, though. Interesting spin as you don't have to think about vowels, just try to use as many as possible of the consonants on offer.

It's a really neat game, though if you're only good at Scrabble/Speed Scrabble, you're going to get owned. Owned hard. 

Maybe that's one of the reasons why I like it, though (forces me to get outside my comfort zone!)

5/4 Comment: After 3 plays, I'm still just as flummoxed by this game because it requires a very different type of thinking than the Scrabble/Speed Scrabble/Text Twist/Bananagrams/Boggle type, which is exactly what it offers. Basically, it's a pure test of wordbuilding with just a little bit of the strategery/gamemanship, but it's a very fair one. Won't demand it gets on the table, but will join as long as people don't mind someone not that good!

Word games are awesome, and this one is really unique since the words you can choose are only limited by your imagination and vocabulary. Love it!

It's a speed word game and while I get walloped in it, it's still quite fun.

A word game that rewards coming up with longer words!!!!!  However, you might get interupted either by your opponents or a timer to add some time pressure to coming up with the word.   Slightly different rules for 2, 3 and 4-5 players, BUT the general idea is solid.   There is also a solo rule variant and a nice implementation online.

Word games are a bit hit-or-miss with me, but this one seems to add a bit more tactics to the genre, since you're not limited strictly to just the letters you draw on a given turn.  Here, so long as you can use what's available on the board, you can stay competitive, though ultimately the person who has the larger vocabulary is still likely to win every time.  As a solitaire game, it's not bad, and I get the feeling that the design -- for solitaire play or otherwise -- helps create some turn angst for people who get one word stuck in their mind based on a set of letters, and then struggle to come up with another one.  It may not be a game with a lot of staying power, but it's not really bad, either.  Word game fans will probably love it.

This is a new take on word games in that you're not restricted to just the letters on the board. I had 3 word games that were my go-to games when I was looking for a word game: Bali, Scrabble, and Boggle. Prolix is now the 4th game on the list.

[i]Prolix[/i] probably works with the designer's friends, but will break in half in every serious game group.

Allowing interrupts is obnoxious, as it rewards experienced players, and permitting common  or "famous" hyper-syllabic words smacks of bad testing and ill judgment.

Also: Bag too small and hands too large.

A word game that I did not like. I need to re-read the rules and see if there is anything that we did wrong.

Prototype: This is an excellent word game, with nice tradeoffs and a fast, intense pace.  Interrupting another player's turn is encouraged, yet doing it excessively is punished.  The at-will one-minute timer is perfect for the game, and helps keep the pace up.
This game is a piece of excellence.  I look forward to being able to purchase it.

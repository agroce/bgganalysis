In its own niche of light hearted, simple family games Kodama: The Tree Spirits is a blast. I thoroughly enjoyed picking up cards, growing my tree and scoring points. Valuing cards was straightforward enough that you did not suffer from analysis paralysis but the choices were not always too obvious. I can imagine myself playing this with kids and spouse.

The game is also one of the best looking ones I have seen. The colour palette is vibrant but not too rich. Art is exciting and cute but not too childish. 

For hardcore gamers Kodama might not offer much of a challenge, and the total 360 degree freedom in laying the cards most definitely is not suited for serious playing. But I think that seriousness is not the point of the game. Tree spirits are good willed creatures and this is reflected in the design.

I am only concerned about the strategical dimension of the game. Maybe the scoring cards could be a bit more powerful to give players more incentive to branch off with their strategy. Moreover, there could be some common scoring categories as well, to introduce more competition over the cards on the display. Now it felt like everyone was just concentrating on their own stuff without paying too much attention to others.

Nevertheless, the joy of playing was more than enough to overcome the apparent lack of strategical depth. Especially since a game does not last too long. Most recommended.

Had a ton of fun with this one.  I liked the decisions, where you had to choose between scoring a bunch of points now (based on consecutive cards with features) or setting up a big score at the end of the season (with a kodama card).  I also really liked how you can't score more than 10 points with a card, so you have to diversify and possibly even abandon a high-scoring branch.

A drawback is that the kodama cards are wildly varied in power.  A card where you score 2 points per feature for one of 2 features (whichever you have less of) is simply worse than one that scores 4 points per branch card that meets certain criteria.  I got 6 points for a weak kodama card, and then 40 from a strong one.

The forest is growing fast! As caretakers for Kodama, the tree spirits, you must keep the forest a healthy and lush home for your little friends. Over three growing seasons, you must cultivate trees with the right mix of flowers, insects, and branch arrangements to make your Kodama as happy as possible. Whoever cares for their Kodama best will be remembered for generations!

Kodama is a simple drafting game in which the object is to build sets.  Each player has some hidden bonuses that add a little spice to what's a pretty tepid broth.  That artwork is reminiscent of Studio Ghibli animations and is really rather lovely.  Production quality is good.

Played 2P and thought it was a very beautiful game.  I could see it not being as fun with higher player counts as there is too much time/randomness between turns.  Fun light game that I'd play with others if they asked, but probably wouldn't suggest it myself.

Card game that relies on the 'isn't that cute?' factor and its unique playing mechanism to deliver. For me it seemed kind of confusing (at least in french and in some parts only) slightly bogging a bit and in the end not that satisfactory as an experience. It is unique and I can see why it might appeal to people (especially non-gamers or at least not heavy-gamers) but it didn't do the trick for me.

This is an interesting take on a card game, using the cards to build beautiful, cartoon trees that sprawl over the table. From an aesthetics perspective the game is lovely, and  I can imagine this game appealing to children because of its table presence; however, the actual gameplay itself is somewhat lacklustre  because all you seem to do is look for an optimal path  to place a scoring card which is largely drawn by chance, with minimal modification by Kodama cards (read objective cards) and season cards, and so becomes a simple exercise in maths rather than strategy or even tactics. There is also no player interaction, making the game a pretty but ultimately quite superficial experience. In addition to these issues, for a game so focused on card placement, the actual card stock itself is dreadful: it feels like the kind of cardboard one finds in a takeaway carton lid, and doesn't speak to the longevity of the cards. It also detracts from the ergonomics and aesthetics of gameplay. Linen finished cards would make this game feel more durable and ergonomically more pleasing. As it stands, it's a nice but forgettable distraction. Play but don't pay.

A card game of absolute randomness and chaos. secret bonus point cards are randomly dealt to each player, some are mediocre and can score 10, some are nuclear and can score 36. Season reward cards are random and can directly conflict with a players current objective. Each round you pick one of four cards to grow your tree. These cards might be perfect for 10 points or dire for 3. Just an utter lottery with woolly rules for the overlapping of cards and a toss up to see who wins. An experience never to be repeated,

The artwork and card-laying mechanic are fantastic, and it's a delight watching your tree grow as the seasons progress. Having to count caterpillars and other features all the time isn't as fun or interesting, but I can live with that. I wouldn't be likely to suggest this on game night with friends, but I'll certainly be keeping it for the solo game - not as a thinky challenge, but just to relax and unwind with my tree spirit friends after a long day at work.

This is a flawed, but reasonably enjoyable game. While its not THAT similar, its biggest problem with me is that it feels a lot like Ticket to Ride in many ways, without being nearly as good.

RATING: 7.25
I enjoy this as a lighter 2-3p experience. The graphic design is modern; regardless if it's "up my alley". Some of the nuances about legal placements bother me, figuring out if its worth trying to finesse cards as close together as possible, but I think the potential is that you generally don't end up concerned with space and the 10 pt max rule tidies up unruly sprawl. I've mixed in the decree and kodama cards from all the promos and after a few games, although there are some varying potential strengths, I'm OK with it. There's a little luck in the branch card flips, there's a little luck in the dealt kodamas, and a touch in the decrees- but its still a game with a handful of tense decisions where skill seems to matter- so the result is a fun game with a little bit of luck, luck that doesn't seem to frustrate too much. So far so good...

If I take some time to clear up a few of the placement rules, probably a little forum browsing, and I like what I find, this is a 7.5

More "Puzzley" that I thought it was going to be.  With the cap of only being allowed to play a card that scores you 10 points really does offer some interesting choices. The special scoring cards per player and for the round seem like they do offer up some replayability.  Solid card game for sure.

Very light game, plays very quick and the score cards will dictate how you grow your tree for the round, which kind of detracts from the game because you need to build that way or you won't score points.  The points you score while building are a little wonky but overall a decent game that plays real quick.

Felt awful for disliking this game so much as it was a surprise gift from my other half (fortunately she hated it too).

For me and my other half, it unfortunately went straight into the wouldn't play again if you paid me camp.

Light fare for meditative play. The color palette is wonderful and the art charming and both are evocative for me as of quiet play in a dark glade by moonlight. (love the tree and critter art...the spirits- not so much) Another piece is how cards are placed in irregular patterns as one grows different tree branches- such a simple thing but it feels both evocative and refreshing as a change from symmetrical placement so common in games.

This game is not very hard, but is really beautiful.  You build the tree from the cards that you draw.  There are different features on the cards that adds up as you connect them undisturbed down to the trunk of your tree.  Each season has a random card drawn that adds a scoring bonus to certain features or gives you an objective to complete to gain additional points.  By the end of the game every player has a unique tree that is quite pretty.  Quite a unique game.

A very enjoyable game. Got it from kickstarter and really liked the look of it. The artistical aspect of the end tree is very exciting to anticipate.

Some games (with certain gamers) can lead to long downtimes with lots of AP as you try very hard to maximise the combination of your current move with your secret kodamas and the current decrees, but if you have a group that agrees to go for the light entertainment all is fine. This risk of AP reduces my rating a bit.

Hopefully there will be some extensions at some point, but then again I still have to see another repetition of a game yet. This really is the beauty here.

Got this as a present and didn't know anything about the game until I learned the rules. It's a very zen card drafting and laying game of building a tree with different features that score points. Each player has their own objectives for scoring so each game is unique. It's a game that doesn't feel stressful nor that random draws have made an impact. Really looking to play this more this year and see if my opinion changes.

An interesting little card/tile laying game about growing a tree and scoring points for various symbols you can graft onto the branches.  Played cleanly, and despite potential problems with the branch placement rules, and sliding cards on the table, it was pleasant enough.   There are problems with the luck of the draw of your end of season goal cards, and the game is way too long.  I think it's trying to be a light filler, but 60+ minutes feels right out of whack.

After 1 Play: Game plays over three rounds, each round with 4 turns involving scoring, then one final scoring round. A decree is announced at the beginning of each round that makes slight changes to how the game scores. Then players take turns adding cards to their trees. Each card has symbols on it which allows you to score points for each other similar symbol on cards below that card (in a contiguous fashion). Then at the end of each round players can play a Kodama card which gives another way to perform a one time scoring.

The game comes with a variety of decree cards, and Kodama cards which I could see help giving this game a bit more life. Unfortunately the game just failed to captivate me. The art is nice, the idea is neat, but it wasn't very interactive and it never game me any moments of excitement or agony. 

Would play again if asked, but nothing I feel like owning. 5.5/10

Wonderful game, with some tactical depth I was not expected firstly.
The theme is very original and cheerful. The rules are light and effective. Chance is there but not preponderant to see growing our tree and to make ours kodama happy
Very pleased with my purchase


In French :
Superbe petit jeu, à la profondeur tactique plus avancée que je ne l'aurais cru au premier abord.
La thématique est vraiment originale et plaisante. Les règles sont simples et épurées.Une pointe de hasard s'ajoute pour voir son arbre grandir et rendre heureux ses kodamas.
Très heureux de mon acquisition

SOLD IT!

First game ever kickstarted.

The artwork and ability to build a painting is what sells this. The point scoring mechanics are bland and often produce similar scores, making things less tactical and more of a "just do fun stuff and see what happens game". The card laying restrictions are a bit superfluous, since in the end you are just creating straight paths that don't intersect.

Nice little set collection game with a unique spacial element. Great artwork.

Really nice set collection game, plays fairly fast due to only being 12 turns long. I like the fairly movel, card placement mechanic whereby you skew the placement of the cards to allow you to place more later on.

 Looks lovely when the game is finished, although the night background does make it a little less clear than the clean lines of the original, but I believe game play here is much better.

The little kodama are cute and the objectives give you something to work towards for the game. Score track could have been better, but then I suppose you would have needed a much larger box.

Nice little card game with beatiful tree-layouts. A little bit too much luck involved by the Kodama cards.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Included Sprout Kodama cards give young kids more powerful scoring bonuses and indicate in which season they should be played, allowing children to compete and win against older players using the regular Kodama cards. Very nice for inclusive family play.

UPDATE: Reduced rating to 5. As a family game with younger kids, it just takes too long for what it is. Scoring is annoyingly fiddly. My younger daughter (4.5 y.o.) can play competitively using the Sprout Kodama cards and enjoys making a pretty tree, but the game just takes too long for her to enjoy—she'd rather play Patchwork. Usually we have played with my 7 y.o. as well, and both kids need help to make sure they score correctly which drags the game out—maybe it would be quick enough with just 2p? The 7 y.o. finds playing with the regular Kodama cards challenging, but needs help keeping track of the seasonal decrees and isn't quite up to using the scoring track herself. I'm sure it would move more quickly with adults, but in that case I'd rather play something else.

UPDATE 2: Rating reduced to 4. Played 2p with my 7 y.o. using the regular (not Sprout) Kodama cards. Too much luck without any effective way to mitigate it. In our game, the cards that came out were consistently more favorable to me than to her, as were the decrees, which she quickly picked up on. If she hadn't received one relatively powerful Kodama card that she could easily achieve, it would have been a blowout in my favor. Counting up the points for various cards is tedious and unfun, and works against the aesthetics of the game.

A therapeutic, enjoyable experience. The strategy is varied and interesting, yet the game play is serene, not cutthroat. The decree and Kodama cards make for interesting twists in the game that no matter how far ahead you may be, force you to play more aggressively than you would otherwise. Plus, the theme and visuals the game creates are interesting and varied. Make sure you have a big enough table to play!

Great game about "growing" your trees. I'm not fond of tile-laying games but this card-laying twist is much more versatile and easy to grasp. The artwork's beautiful too. The only downside is that some of the Kodama bonus cards can feel way swingy. It feels like there should've been some sort of even distribution with the more powerful ones.

Relaxing and satisfying (growing your tree), potentially a good before bedtime game with the kids; it could kindle magical dreams....

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The game is very cute and overall quite solitary; you are more concerned about how to build your tree, as everyone has a hand of secret objectives to score points on. The first playthrough, you might not realize just how important it is the precise orientation that you put down a card--whenever you play a card, it can only overlap with ONE card. It is very handy to be able to create forks in your branches, but doing this while keeping the overlap rule in mind can make it very tricky.

As the current player is the only one who takes from the card display, and the display is refilled after their turn, the game can start to drag with higher player counts, which is why I think the game is voted as "best with 3".

The art is amazing and I love the tree building mechanic/aesthetic. There are a variety of ways to earn points, and I wish that felt just a little more thematic. My biggest complaint is the "max 10 points per turn" rule, which feels really arbitrary. The strategy still works fine, but I think I'd rather "try to score as many points as possible each round" vs. "try to score as close to 10 each round." Of course, I understand the balance issues with a steadily-increasing score, and it almost certainly leads to more interesting gameplay with the max 10 points rule; I just don't like the way that particular rule feels.

Initial Rating: 5.0 (August 2017)

Before playing Kodama: The Tree Spirits I didn’t know anything about the game so I didn’t know what to expect. After I played it, I can say it isn’t a game for me. It is way too light.

The rules of the game are pretty easy. You can teach them under 6 minutes. Playtime is around 60 minutes.

I like the theme.

The game´s component are ok, although the small scoring tokens are easily confused. The art is ok as well. Once you have a big tree, it looks great on the table.

The decisions needed to play the game are very obvious, in your turn you need to choose among 4 cards and the best one is glaringly obvious. So it is mostly luck that decides who wins. Luck of the draw is very high and you have no way to mitigate it. 

Best with 3 players although it has almost no player interaction. The best you can do to “attack” another player is to take the card that was best suited to his tree, but, in that case, you won’t score the maximum points you could have so many players won’t bother to block his opponents. 

The game comes with many goal cards and some scoring cards (I don’t remember the names, I didn’t read the rules) so the replayability factor seems high. It seems the goal cards are unbalanced, some are much easier to accomplish and give a lot of VPs.

It is reminiscent of The Little Prince: Make Me a Planet (a game I heavily dislike), but this one is a lot better.
 
Bottom line, Kodama: The Tree Spirits is way too light for me. It has very easy decisions so I was bored by it. The luck factor is through the roof and there is no way to control it (a huge issue for me). I think it can be a good family game, but I will sell it ASAP. 

Current Rating: 4.0

RATING: 7.5
Effectively second edition of designer's earlier game Kigi, and overall an improvement. The core of the game has each player 'growing' their own tree by playing branch cards onto their starting trunk card. There are symbols on the cards, playing successive cards with matching symbols scores points is the basic method of scoring points.
It has less interaction than Kigi as you can't play on others' trees. Normally interaction is something I look for in a game, but here it has the positive effect of pruning (see what I did there?) Kigi's chainsaw-like branch cutting rules which are replaced by a simple ban on playing cards that would score over 10 points.
That you are dealt 4 points scoring bonus cards, one of which will be evaluated at the end of each of the three rounds, adds a little planning and gives you something to aim for other than the basic points scoring for each card played.
Overall a very relaxing game. which makes a nice opener or come-down game after something longer and more intense.

Stands out for its freeform card-laying that simulates growing a tree. Past this novelty, there's a too simple card game to keep a gamer interested. Balancing immediate points vs. points from scoring cards isn't really a challenge. To curb the anti-thematic growing of a single point-maximizing branch, the author had to set a point Limit for each move. Ok for playing casually but nothing I would seek out.

I really like the artwork, but I think the 10 point rule is a terrible mechanic. I get that you don't want players to generate long single branch trees, but this rule is so artificial to the game play that it indicates a core problem with the scoring mechanic. I wonder if an interesting fix would be to play with the scoring mechanic from Ingenious, where you only score the value of your lowest symbol. This would encourage players to "branch out" so to speak, without explicitly limiting where a card can be placed.

Very cool tree-building game with individual scoring conditions and events (season decrees). Be warned, it has almost no player interaction as it is an upmost solitary experience. But you can draft the Kodamas at the start to give people better chances of creating score combos. Still it's a beautiful and cool game...

Kodama is adorable and easy to learn, but with layers of strategy if you want to play more competitively. The instructions are some of the best I've received from a Kickstarter game.

All of the illustrations are beautifully cartoonish - especially the chubby tree spirits. The mechanic of carefully placing cards askew to leave room for more pieces is unique and clever.

This is a perfect game for players of different ages and skill levels. We were instant addicts!

Highly recommended.

Played this for the first time tonight at the brewery. Very cute game about "growing" a tree over the course of three seasons: Spring, Summer, and Fall. Each season has a unique scoring bonus that changes from game to game. Players also have their own variable bonuses that they apply as well.

It's easy and very fast but it still offers quite a lot of enjoyment and even some difficult choices (the order in which you decide to score you Kodama cards can be quite hard to plan out). There is plenty of variation but the game is still very balanced (our scores have always been very close although our trees look different). Would recommend if you are looking for a fast and cute looking light game in a small package. Some people have trouble with understanding the scoring system but it's just basic math.

Wanted to like this more than i did. The branch laying felt too restrictive to offer interesting choices and instead it was a simple thing to look at my hand of kodamas and find the optimal manner in which to try and play my game. The kodamas totally dictate the victory. 

Ultimately a disappointed 5, for me

I rarely take changes with KSs from companies I have never played any games from, let alone enjoyed. I took a chance on Kodama because I had heard great things about it's predecessor and the addition of the Kwanchi artwork was a selling point for me. I also have a soft spot for tree spirits in general (thanks Princess Mononoke). The project was delivered ahead of schedule and most everything was great about the production of the game. The cardstock is really nice, as are the rest of the components. It was a really nice surprise when I discovered that the gameplay was also exactly what I was looking for. Its a lighter game for sure, but it scratches that itch that I get for feeling like I am building something during a game while I also testing a little of spatial relations, all while testing me strategically. All in all this was a great find.

Cute, but way too light for me. This should have been marketed as a childrens game. Zero strategy involved. Pick up any of the four Kodama cards, place it on any branch, and score lots of points (regardless which card you chose or where you placed it).

Adorable and beautiful little game about trees, with a really neat play feature. You build your tree with cards at various angles, giving a great montage feel and a nice "thing" built once play is done. I like that.

The game itself is not bad, though the placement rules allow the players to be as fun-killing as they want to be. We were pretty casual about them. Not a whole lot of interaction, but it's not really that kind of game. Curious as to how well it plays with 2.

Beautiful and atmospheric, there is a lot to be said for a game that ends with you building a beautiful tree! Scoring can feel a bit lame sometimes though. The 10-point limit is clearly a bandaid, and there is a LOT of luck of the draw, some sets of Kodama (scoring criteria) are clearly better than others. The coolness of building a tree that could turn out totally bizarre or beautiful makes the game.

Enfin un peu de fraîcheur dans le monde du jeu. La boîte est moyennement réussie, mais les arbres élaborés par les joueurs sont du plus bel effet en fin de partie.

Gorgeous game, this turns heads every time I take it out. Although a bit of a table hog, you'll find yourself trying different builds with different objectives every game. Sometimes you'll build a sprawling tree that travels along the table edge and other times you'll have a single, long vertical branch while other times it will be perfectly balanced. Any way you build, the results are beautiful. The scoring can be a bit tough to get for new gamers and the tokens on the track are small and easy to misplace.

This game has been a real hit at the table ever since I received it. It's quick and easy to teach, has a lot of interesting strategic elements, like balancing out when to place branches to gain the most placement points and when to place it so you score more on your Kodama cards. The building up of the trees gives the game a real visual appeal to it and it draws the attention of anyone passing by the table when you play.

Easy instructions, beeyootiful artwork, excellent card quality (so glossy and stiff that I succumbed and did a clumsy overhand shuffle rather than my usual riffle shuffle). Very gentle play - sure, you're competing against each other, but really, you can pretend to just please your Kodama and ignore the score track if you want. This feels like Patchwork in terms of game play for us.

**Pretty and easy, but could get boring if played often.

A well-designed game, but not for me. I typically really enjoy games from Action Phase, but this one didn't gel with me like I was hoping it would. The balance is almost too much so, and the limb placement is a little frustrating, both in appearance and how it's supposed to work. The rules just say that new branches can attach to existing branches so long as they don't overlap others, but the difference in thickness of each branch throws me off. I imagine that families will like this game more than I do.

Based on one play: I really like the art work, you can tell when a company cares about the look and it shows in this game. But the game play leaves a lot to be desired. You extend your tree branches which need to align, but don't over think it as they will never match perfectly and base don the icons shown you score points each turn and then chose one your your scoring cards for additional points at the end of each 4 turns. It is cute but that is not enough, as the game play is not very interesting.

I enjoyed Kigi alright but this one has a lot more problems. Kigi has its own set of problems and this was just added on problems. It really didn't work for me.

Card placement rules are too picky- all in all I would pick Kigi to play again, but even that is on my trade pile.

Bit disappointed at how light this seems to be. Maybe a four player game with some fighting over the cards and - dare I say it - even a little spite would help pep up an overly simple set-collection game. It's so easy to get sets that the design has a limit on scoring each turn.

This little game went above and beyond my expectations. It is relaxing to play and growing your trees is downright fun. The perfect level of strategy to keep it interesting.

I imagine it will be taken to small Friday night hangouts for a while.

In this game, players draft branch cards and then add them to their tree. The placement of the branch scores points based on the icons printed on the card, and the icons matching on all cards that path back to the trunk. The puzzle of the game is some combination of flip luck, and trying to align your branch placements with your secret end of round goal cards, that you'll score three out of 4 for. It's a quick game with very cute graphic design, and while there aren't many tough choices, the overall experience of the game is pleasant as you watch your tree grow and try to maximize your points and placements.

My family picked it up, and yes it is a family game. The illustrations on the card are pretty especially since they are cartoonish. 
You place your cards to build a tree starting on from the trunk of course. The mechanic of placing the cards so as not to overlap but one is clever. Scoring is by matching icons on the trunk from the outside in. Which makes for a nice puzzle. The season objectives provide for some variability in what is desirable, as do you private objectives.

If you want a relaxing game with a small bit of challenge it is worth it.

Nice theme, the game system works well and the gameplay is OK. 

Unfortunately the game is ruined by unbalanced Kodama cards. Some of the Kodama cards are clearly more powerful and at the same the easier to accomplish than others. The point difference can be huge between two different Kodama cards. You could basically decide the winner by initial Kodama card draw. 

No need to play this ever again, unless the Kodama cards are balanced OR some of the Kodama cards are removed from the deck OR there is point limit for Kodama cards (like seen in many other well balanced games).

Simple points scoring game in which players get points based on building up sequences of particular symbols.

It's hard to beat building a tree so it's nice that there are two games that let you start with a trunk and end with a full tree. Kodama isn't as peacefully beautiful as Kigi but it's more appealing to kids and has an actual box. I personally prefer Kigi but Kodama has been played more in our house. The rules as written were a little confusing for such a simple game and could probably stand to be rewritten.

Elegant game with a zen feeling: you get a sense of fulfillment to grow your tree. Luck of the draw is quite important (especially for the kodama cards, that can make a great difference) + can have some downtime if some players are slow optimizers: I won't recommend it at high player counts, it can feel a bit long for a game where chance is that important. Very enjoyable at 2 or 3 players.

It sure is pretty, which is pretty much all it's got going for it.  I'd rate it a point lower if it weren't so pretty.

As a strategy game, it is lacking due to poor balance.  While individual spirit (score goal) cards are balanced, drawing a set of 4 and picking 3 has huge variance in terms of how synergistic they are.  Also, random draws during the game are vert influential, and there are few opportunities to make strategic choices (over
obvious tactical plays).

As a pleasing light game, it is lacking due to mathiness.  Every turn, you pick one of 4 cards and put it in 1 of 4 places based on what is the max score.  There is a little planning around spirit cards and future cards, but mostly you are just finding the best legal score among 16 options.

I don't mind the math in a strategy game, or light choices in a pleasing game, but this gets the worst of both worlds.

Cute tile (card) laying game with positive 'eco' theme and great cartoon kids friendly art. Plays relatively quickly. Kodama and Season cards ads variety to the game so they are velcomed. Good game !

Downside: average components quality and big footprint for this otherwise portable game.

Decent card placement game, almost tile-placement like. The Kodama cards are fun because they give you goals to work toward, and I like that each season provides a different flavor to how the rounds go. It's a bit slow and out of control with 4, but with 2 or 3, I'd bet it would move quickly and you'd have a chance to wait a round before taking the card you want. Also, the art is pretty adorable.

RATING: 5
So I kind of respect the freeform way this game is played but a terrible rules explanation and uneven scoring opportunities ruin most of that goodwill.  In this game players take turns drafting a branch card with different details on them like caterpillars, mushrooms, stars, etc.  You add the branch to your tree and after each player has drafted a certain number of branches you play a scoring card that scores in different ways.  There are 3 rounds of this and the highest score at the end wins.

So the cards are just laid however you like on top of one another with the only two major rules being that they can't overlap more than 1 card and they can't cover up any of the features.  So that leaves a little too much up for interpretation.  And players can have different interpretations making for uneven play where a play one player thinks is illegal another thinks is fine and there is no clear ruling in the rulebook.

Also each player plays a scoring card at the end of each round and these should be balanced but they aren't at all.  Some cards that are difficult to achieve can score far less than others that are easy to obtain naturally through gameplay.  This can cause huge insurmountable leads and decide a winner early in the game.

The Kodama are really cute though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Kodama couldn't get more charming even if you draped a charm bracelet owned by Alyssa Milano over it and propped it up under the singing birds of Disneyland's Enchanted Tiki Room.

Strengths for me include the short rounds, the seasonal objectives, and the clever scoring track (some find it confusing, but I want it to become the norm), but making the pleasant and unassuming tree spirits happy is surely the best bit.

Maybe I'm just sour because I always lose, but while I think this game is interesting, unique and somewhat fun, it has a lot of luck and the tree building is fiddly. It's a good filler with nice art but lacks that bit of extra oompf as well as luck mitigation. Perhaps it would benefit from more Kodama cards and more in hand to choose from, particularly when you need to frame strategies around all but one - and there is nothing worse than 'I need mushrooms to win' when there are no mushrooms coming out. Can be a bit mathy too, but probably a good level of mathy and does at times have some interesting strategic predicaments.

Bought the game to play with my kids and it's good for that. There's not a ton of strategy in it and the best move always seems somewhat obvious.

Kodama is a lighter game about growing trees and attracting tree spirits. You start with a tree trunk that has one of six scoring features (caterpillars, fireflies, flowers, mushrooms, clouds or stars). Each round you pick a card from the central display and add it to your tree. There are some placement restrictions, but I won't bother going into them now. Every feature on that branch scores, and all matching features on branches you can trace back from that card to the tree trunk score (as well as on the tree trunk itself). There's a limit though, you can't score more than 10 points... if a card would exceed that, then you can't play the card.

At the end of every four rounds you stop the game and play a tree spirit card from your hand. You have 4 tree spirits and there are 3 chances to play a tree spirit. You get however many points it says on your card, which is looking for various features of your tree. So plan ahead and build your tree with your scoring cards in mind.

I like the game. It was cute. It seemed really unbalanced though. Two of my four tree spirits maxed out at 12 points. One of my opponents was able to score 32 points on one card and 20 on another. Given that we both were limited on how many points we could score on tree limbs, the fact that he could score so much more on tree spirits gave him a huge advantage over me.

Bought it because I love trees and now you can build your own. And it looks damn cute. As a game it’s much better than I expected. Of course you have to fiddle around with the cards to make sure enough is left for future cards, and you might be lucky to pick up the cards you were waiting for. With two players you can think about your actions during the other player’s turn, I don’t think that’s possible if you play with 4 or 5 players. Scoring is simple and the bonuses are as well.

The great artwork and theme drew me into the kickstarter for this game and it does look great on the table.  I've only played the game with the "sprout" kid's scoring so far and there was a nice balance of long term and short term goals, but the game kind of fell flat overall.  I think playing with older gamers who don't mind the math of scoring every single turn and using the more advanced scoring cards should spice up the decision space a bit.

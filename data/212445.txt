GAME: Blood Bowl (2016 edition)
RANK: 539
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Pros:
Amazing miniatures. Fairly streamlined rules. Set in the  the old Warhammer universe (none of this Age of Sigmar nonsense!). Nostalgia. Fun!

Cons:
Games sometimes take 2-2.5 hours to play which feels too long. Sprinting an extra square only to fall over and die after failing an armour check :(

N.B. 
My brothers and I enjoyed the 2nd edition as teens. I made my own Champions of Death team with some converted skeletons and a mummy from HeroQuest. 

I have the base game Human and Ork teams and an Elven Union team.

RATING: N/A
Cranking game design (thanks Jervis!) that still rocks to the present. Slows down as players gain more skills (=more and more special rules) but at the core it's fairly quick to start playing and a long learning curve as your skills develop.

Played via Cyanide's PC port Blood Bowl 2. I love Blood Bowl. It's a ridiculous game, with orcs and elves and all the usual Warhammer guys playing a (more) violent version of American football. On a player's turn they can activate each guy on their team once, but if they make a mistake at any point then their turn ends and their opponent gets to go. Simple. The game is all about risk management, as the dice can and will screw you at times, but good players will know how to get the best out of their players, how to take the fewest risks, and when to throw it all out the window and push their luck. So much fun played in a league format, where your players level up and gain abilities and/or injuries (or die!) over a whole season.

RATING: 8.5
Blood bowl is a game of "fantasy" football with rules that are more of an amalgamation of rugby and football. The up front rules are not terribly complicated, though there are a lot of different skill checks and such that make your first game or two slower, until you know when to use each by heart. There is a lot of dice rolling, but it's used in a way that doesn't feel super lucky, and rather boils down to when you want to take chances. For being a sports game, the rules are fairly thematic, and fans of the game claim that it has one of the most solid season formulas of any board game. I would love to test this for myself...

The classic fantasy football game formula has not been changed hardly at all for this edition of Blood Bowl, which I think is for the better. It means that old teams and old stats can still be used for the current edition while we wait for new teams to be released.

On the whole, I like this game a lot! The mini's are well done and begging to be painted. The dice chucking is fun and the various fantasy teams vary greatly and are very intriguing to me. I hope to maybe start my own season of this soon.

RATING: N/A
I do not own the game, but a friend is allowing me to keep it on my shelf. Limited play time, but the game so far is fun. The theme is ridiculous, but engaging. The erratic nature of the dice will obviously throw you into a fit, but having coached sports before...it doesn't feel that different from coaching in real life. Just like in real life coaching, this game will make you scream out "How'd you not catch that?" or "stay on feet for crying out loud!" If you understand that you can do everything right and still lose, you will probably fun with this game.

Although I rarely pick up games without expecting to play them regularly, I bought this mainly for nostalgia as Blood Bowl doesn't really appeal to anyone in my group. I played my friends copy of the third edition years ago whilst we were at school and instantly fell in love with the game. I have played the game on digital platforms since then, but unfortunately the randomness of multiple die-rolls and fairly extensive rules for the game mean I'll only be able to play this one rarely (both of these being the barriers of entry for my game group) - but I am very much looking forward to getting it back to the table when I can. The game is a lot of fun - in theme and gameplay, and whilst a series of bad rolls can be deeply frustrating there is a lot of strategy to explore in the game and the "better" and/or the more patient player will usually win the game.

Blood Bowl, the holy grail.
I played the PC version and I found it pretty mediocre. Somehow I ended up buying the card game and I LOVED it. My first game wasn't even finished as I ordered both expansions. This game became one of the few that I consider "my favourite game".

So I thought it would be fair to give it a second chance. After reinstalling the game I ended up, again, finding it mediocre.

But I didn't want to give up... Suddenly there was a review of the newest version and in a moment of weakness I ordered the game.

The game is a blast. As a board game. For me.

Maybe it's the head-to-head part, maybe the minis but I like this game.
Don't know why, can't explain.

It's a classic, and this box set provides the base essentials for a new gaming generation. Superb quality, fairly simple intuitive mechanics (refined from over 20 years of play testing), and gorgeous miniature design. I do wish they had included one or two start players for both teams, and perhaps an Ogre and Troll to really amp up the team customisation options, but... For the price, a fantastic package. Easily the best fantasy sports game available. Long may it be supported - I shall certainly be looking to acquire every additional release for it.

This remains playful, humourous, and intriguingly deep yet still easy to learn. Games are not always quick, but the balance is outstanding and there's enough here to last a lifetime. The league rules take a great game to sublime heights, adding in roleplay progression and a genuine sense of emotional investment. GW's best.

A remake of the early 90s classic, the 2016 edition of Blood Bowl streamlines the game rules and makes it easy for veterans of the game and rookies alike. You make a team up of either ratmen, orcs, dwarves, humans, elves, or other fantasy based races. Then you can either play a single game amongst a friend or do a league style game where you and your friends are playing in a league much like a fantasy style of NFL. Another major bonus of this, much like any other Games Workshop game, is that you can paint and customize your miniatures however you want. If you are fans of the Warhammer series, football, and all sorts of carnage and mayhem, I greatly advise getting this game.

Hard to believe how long this has been out of print, but I love that GW brought this back with essentially no changes in the rules.   The miniatures are absolutely stunning in terms of their quality, design, and detail.  Nobody even comes close to GW in this category.   Very glad to see this classic come back.   One of the pillar games in my history as a gamer.

Blood Bowl is a Love/Hate relationship with me. I admire the design and want to play because of that. I also hate to play because it is endless frustration because I just cannot seem to prioritize in my mind what order I should be doing things in. I get excited and...Turnover. I do what I think is safe...Turnover. I do the action that I feel needs to be done this turn...Turnover. But it is also just so chaotic and so vibrant a game. Watching these blunders and watching the perfect play unfold. So, after selling my stuff I'm back in with both feet with way too much stuff right now. And I love it!

Wow, huge improvement over LRB 6. The significant changes were in the league rules, but they completely shake up what was a very stale league structure that caused most leagues to spiral down the drain after a few seasons. 

**New information 12/21/2017 - The specialist group just confirmed that they wanted the shitty old CRP inducement TV match, putting the senseless underdog penalty back into full effect, which means... rare Star Players, and as a bonus you can now chase away more new players from your league. Yay.  Downgrading from a 7 to 5,  based on this ruling

The basic rules are unnecessarily complicated. They are not too complicated, but much more than they need to be (2d6s, d8s, d16s, special dice, coins, tables...). This, in turn, makes the game longer than it needs to be. Bloodbowl is still designed from a war-game perspective rather than from a boardgame one, and it has all the crunch of GW products.

The miniatures are beautiful. Maybe they requiere a bit too much assembly, but that's not an issue for most players into miniature games. It is disappointing that the team expansions do not include players cards as the basic game does.

Soy consciente que no he llegado a jugar ni una partida completa, aunque sí que he visto jugar hasta marcar.

Me pareció un juego muy lento, en el que cada turno tienes que ir moviendo tus jugadores de uno en uno. Y después de todo el curro que lleva colocarlos y hacer la jugada, marca uno de los dos y vuelta a empezar... colocar a todos de nuevo, etc.

No le pongo peor nota porque no lo he jugado bien y no me parecería justo.

Blood Bowl is a game of Fantasy Football. The basic game features a match between two teams drawn from a number of fantasy archetypes, playing a warped version of American Football.

The Blood Bowl boxed game contains two teams: Humans, an all-round team who are flexible enough to adapt to any style of play, or Orcs, who make up in brute force what they lack in finesse. The teams are represented by coloured plastic miniatures, and push-fit assembly is required before use. The game is expandable, and additional rules and teams will be made available through expansion sets and supplements.

I love Blood Bowl, the Game with full league rules is fantastic. 

I find GW's way of doing things very annoying, though, and bought this boxed set just for some for some physical components.

Ultimately I don't like play in person as much as I do on the PC. Or maybe I've just played it too much (many hundreds of games).

It's a miniature game like other Games Workshop Games (Warhammer, Warhammer 40k, Heroquest etc.) It involves a lot of dice rolling and moving miniatures. The game is fun but it does have a steep learning curve. The box, the playing field and the miniatures are superb. There is a lot of detail and everything is really well made. 

The manual unfortunately is badly written. The keywords are not highlighted. There is a lot of text describing simple rules. The intro "drill" chapter doesn't help much. Simple rules (for new players) are merely 8 pages but still I've found myself flipping through them many times. Full rules take about 8 more pages. 

You have to ask yourself if it is worth it to go through the hassle of understanding the rules, dice rolling, miniature painting. My answer is: definitely :)

*Most important*
The biggest downside and upside  at the same time is that this is not a stand alone game! It does looks like one -
 different colored teams, box with everything in it. As a stand alone game it is mediocre. Even buying other teams doesn't help - it is still pretty bland. The thing is that this is a miniature game and you need to play with other people in a league. Then it is totally different game - your players get better, get injured, sometimes even die (that hurts), it hugely affect consequent games. There is a sense of achievement when you build a successful team. You need to invest a bit in other miniatures to get into the game but it's not that bad (at most you need another box of your team and 1-2 single models). 

For a miniature lovers and people willing to play in leagues - this is a 10/10, for board gamers - 6/10 if not less.

One of my favorite games of all time. I've played Bloodbowl for over 20 years. So glad it's back in print with a new edition.

Pros - best campaign/leveling system in a game ever.

Cons -
The rulebook for the new edition is a bit of a mess. Info is all over the place (even split between multiple books). i hope they either make a better cheat sheet guide or make a version of the rulebook organized in a way that makes looking up info during a game quicker and easier. 

Even just highlighting the key sentences of each section would help. Each agility or action has a huge wall of text that isn't necessary but if the would just put the one line that is important in bold it would be ok.

Update: joined local league and getting in 2-3 games a week and loving it. As long as they keep a slow and steady release of teams I think we will see the league play flourish. I hope they rerelease dungeon bowl next year to give the community another shot on interest.

Not a lot has changed with the release of BB 2016 edition, and if you didn't like it before you certainly won't like it now.

BB is a fantasy football miniatures game (literally, fantasy mixed with rugby/american football) set in a more cheery version of Games Workshop's Warhammer universe. Humans, Orcs, Elves, Ratmen and many other fantasy races duke it out on the football field and try to win by scoring touchdowns in a parody of the real thing.

In reality BB plays like a luck based, masochistic, mental-punishment generator. Dice decide the outcome of every action outside basic movement, and if you fail a roll at any point your remaining turn is forfeited and its your opponent's go. Its an archaic and unforgiving system that can swing victory back and forth or cause a spiralling loss that smashes one team to pieces, but it works for the style of the game,

At the same time there is more depth and strategy then you might think. Testament to this is how an experienced player will almost always beat a rookie player hands down. This would not be the case if it was all just swingy luck! Under all the chaos is a notable strategic element that revolves around careful planning, positioning and risk management, one that requires experience and an understanding of your chosen team.

The basic boxed game gives you the basic experience with two teams (Humans and Orcs), but it isn't the FULL experience. Games Workshop force you to also buy the Death Zone Season 1 Book which introduces the real meat and potato of BB- league play. Playing with a group of other players in a league is the way BB was designed to be played, and much of the satisfaction of the game is in stringing together your matches and watching your team progress and develop (if they are lucky). Playing in a league also makes each game more entertaining as new teams and skills increase the depth and complexity, and the effects of each game will go on to effect your team's future.

Every game is bitter sweet for me, and as much as I enjoy the game as a whole I have some matches where I just want to take the game board and throw it into my opponents face, then grab the table and use it to smash up my whole board game collection. This sweet-sour sensation is one of the driving things that has kept me coming back in stops and starts for the last 17 years- every match is an emotional roller coaster (if you are playing by the league rules and not just a stand alone game), as you pray to BB's football god Nuffle not to win but for your favourite players not to be perma-killed or perma-crippled in just 4 dice rolls. I believe this is also probably the sensation that will either keep you coming too or turn you off immediately.

Its more expensive then ever (Games Workshop are pushing an aggressive 'one over priced thing per expansion' product plan that makes even FFGs blush with shame), and is certainly not for everyone. However if you are rich, like masochistic games of luck, Ameritrash, fantasy themed fluff, modelling and miniatures, chaotic unbalanced odds and have several other like-minded people who are also willing to buy all the same stuff and play then this may just be for you.

I liked the 1988 edition and this new one makes me love the game even more. There are just minor changes from the Competition rules and this is a good thing, because the game was almost perfect. The 2016 edition has better miniatures, a better board and componets and it is bringing new gamers into the pitch.

Fun, but I would rather almost play Battle Ball for a similar experience. What sets this one apart is its advanced ruleset, which I would probably never play with since it requires you to make your own players and such. Still probably the best game that tackles this theme (no pun intended).

Fun combat game with a dash of sport in it, mixing the more brutal aspects of American football with the positions and scoring of European football.  I liked the game, but did not fall in love with it on my first play.  My fear is it may not see many more as my wife did not enjoy the game at all due to its randomness.

I haven't played my copy of 2016, but have played Blood Bowl for over 20 years and there's still nothing that rivals Blood Bowl league play with the right people and how this game constructs a narrative around your team. I rate this a 10 as a campaign game. Playing one-off games are not nearly as nice. I'd probably rate it a 7 or 7.5 in that case.

Luck does have a part on it, but as a former Football player and coach, that element is needed and welcome, since you can't control everything. In hundreds of games, I may recall a couple I lost due to bad luck, but I also won a few thanks to the dice. As a rule, the game rewards the best tactician.

RATING: 8
A tense, 2-player fantasy sports game that unfortunately lets luck win the day over strategy thanks to a heavy reliance on dice-rolling.

Also, the rules could be DRASTICALLY reduced and streamlined, making the game easier to learn. As it stands, it feels like a throwback to the 80s in numerous ways, thanks in-part to the redundancy of the rulebook and the reliance on dice-rolling charts.

Awesome game albeit a bit luck and somewhat rules heavy. The game isn't hard but there can be a bit "what do I need to add to this" in this game. I'm sure if played over multiple days, it'll become second nature, but our first play of this was a tad on the slow end.

Looking to pick up most/all the teams. At $35 a pop, it's just cheap enough to be an impulse buy. The minis look great and they fit together easily. Would love to get a season going.

RATING: 5
I don't understand why people rate this so high! So much waiting for dice rolls, while the resulting randomness doesn't fit with a game this long. Said randomness also greatly reduces the influence of strategy, and the amount of rules is excesive for such a luck-based game.
This is just obsolete.

Too expensive for what it is. Doesn't need the 'fancy' minis. 

The mechanics are a bit archaic, would have been better had they updated/streamlined the rules. 

That said, this is really a fascinating game. I don’t mind sports, and will occasionally go to a game, but I mean… who give a shit about fantasy football? Nevertheless, this is an game with interesting decisions and tense gameplay. At bottom, this is a game about risk management. But I don’t know if there’s any other game that has provided the same level of drama and emotional swings as BB. Must play with the League rules. Too bad it’s a GW product, though. Note: a match takes 3hrs to play – it would be worlds better is a match could be realistically played (without timer) in 90mins.

BB is a classic that's had a lot of love from its community in developing well-defined rules over a couple or three decades.  My only suggestion would be to limit each player's go to 5 or 6 activations max (standing up not counting against that maximum).

Blood Bowl is probably the most approachable miniatures game out there, and you don't have to be a sports fan to love it. I played this game back in high school and then started playing again when the new edition was released in late 2016. The League play is what really makes this game shine. League play turns this into part miniatures game, part board game, and even part role playing game. NOTE: I demoted this from a '9' to a '7' after being in 1 1/2 league seasons of about 10-12 games total. The games are too long for what I get out of the game. It's still an approachable and somewhat laid back miniatures game, but when I look at my watch at the end of a game, the time I spent isn't as worth the payoff as other games I could play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3.5
This game is a bore to play and relies on pointless, abstract tactics that don't really mimic sport. There is no momentum or other rule than models exceptional team performance in single games. The theme and figures are outstanding. I enjoy painting and building teams. The game play should actually be fun. I noticed in the last league that I joined than not a single player was smiling during play. This game takes longer than the box advertises… especially in league play. Many of the advancement, inducement and apothecary rules simply exist to prevent experienced, optimized teams from losing cherished players to capricious injury and violent death. Inexperienced players become doormats used to advance more player's teams.

This is a game of two halves.

On the one hand, it is a fun, light, random, goofy game about developing your team over multiple games ... often with hilarious consequences.

On the other hand, it is a challenging game. When it is your turn, you can keep doing actions ONLY until you fail an important one (a ball throw or such like). Then your turn ends immediately and your opponent starts theirs. This means that playing Blood Bowl properly can require very complex judgement and 'push your luck'. You have to make the most of your turn by doing things in exactly the right order.

It boils down to how hard you can be bothered to think about your moves (i.e. are you "playing for fun" or ... properly!)

Unfortunately this means Blood Bowl is one of those odd games that are mentally taxing and yet plagued by high randomness. If you can get past that issue and have fun with the team-building etc, you will find Blood Bowl to be  a superlative experience of fantasy (American) football. 

It has decades of goofy history behind it. Long may it last. I love it, no matter how frustrating it is when I lose.

Don't get me wrong I love 2nd Edition and kind of fell out of love of love with third edition onwards, know GW are considered to be antichrist , however, LOVING chance to play this and introduce rookies to it in a great new format and box content. Only complaint is blatant GWism changing miniature size which (as goood as they look) is obviously down to wanting to sell new range. Fair play as they invented it and want to make money, but luckily I still have 2nd Edition. I love it as a returner and great for new players!!!

GW's best rule set ever. What makes this is the turnover rule. Because a failure (a player falling over, failing to catch a pass or pick up the ball etc.) end your turn, the coach is constantly faced with the tough choice of which actions to do first: if you manoeuvre your players for a better position before the all important play, bad luck might mean you never get to take the potentially game-changing action; if you do the latter first, you may miss the opportunity to improve your overall board position. This makes for difficult and fun dilemmas. On top of that, all the subsystems (blocking, agility rolls etc.) are relatively clean for a GW game. 

Just as importantly, the different teams do, for this new player at least, feel genuinely different. First I played as the humans against the orks, then as the humans against the skaven. In the first I really felt like I was the nimble-footed side against the hard-hitting but slow juggernaut; in the second I felt that I was now that juggernaut. I liked the way that while my team stayed the same, I really was having to adapt my play style to the opposition. 

I can only imagine that the game really shines with league play, but that is something I'll probably never experience. Still, even without this, it is very solid.

There are negative points. The fumble rules seem too restrictive, making throwing the ball too risky. But perhaps without these it would be too strong a play. The game is long (45-120 mins? don't make me laugh). The worst is that it is a GW game: rules for teams coming in separate rulebooks, no pdfs so you can easily read up on the rules to prepare for the game if you don't own it, needing to collect miniatures to properly run a team. As such, it's not really for me, but I do appreciate the opportunity to play it. 

Lastly, if you hate dice-rolling in games, avoid this like the plague. The game is not an "unmitigated luckfest", as mitigating the luck is one of the challenges of the game. But there are many people who will hate it.

:thumbsup: Awesome miniatures. The different players are easily distinguishable. I was drawn in by the quality of the sculpts.
:thumbsup: [i]League Play[/i] adds so much to this game. It's easier to organize and keep track of than campaign systems for other miniature games - at least that's the case at my FLGS.
:thumbsup: Nearly every game has one or more memorable moments that you'll fondly recall and retell.
:thumbsup: Even though assembly is still required, the miniatures are snap-fit and easy to assemble.
:thumbsup: It really feels like a rough and bloody fantasy football game. Just beating up your opponent doesn't suffice. You really do need to score touchdowns in order to win.
:thumbsup: The game has a very bearable release schedule with its expansions. There's plenty of teams with different playstyles to pick from, with more coming down the line.

----

:thumbsdown: The learning curve is steep. Very steep. As a newbie, you have to be able to cope with taking a beating from veterans.
:thumbsdown: Apply a good dose of [i]"It's just a game."[/i] when playing, because the dice will screw you over at the worst possible times... But that's how Blood Bowl builds its tension, and you learn to appreciate that through repeated plays. If not, this game is probably not for you.
:thumbsdown: The miniatures included in the boxed game aren't enough to built an optimal roster for either team. So if you don't want to proxy or convert miniatures, you'll have to buy additional team boxes. The boxes for the new teams suffer from the same problem, so you'll need to buy multiples for the optimal roster - except for the Dwarves. One box suffices there.

Though the profit motive alone should be enough reward, double thumbs up to GW for bringing back this classic in a beautiful and (relatively) affordable edition.

I played first edition just about the week it came out with a friend who was obsessed with American football, and never looked at it again until this edition came along. It has Sacr Hulk’s magic formula of accessible fast rules with high customisability and both tactical and strategic depth. Forget legacy - we need more campaign games with roster sheets and a book of tables. 80s gaming brought into the 21st century with nothing more than a (welcome and entirely unnecessary) cosmetic makeover.

Got hooked playing Blood Bowl on the Xbox.  Had to order the tabletop.   The game seems simple on the surface, but, it isn't since you have to decide how to build your team, select player skills, and determine strategies on how to play different teams with different skill sets.  Blood Bowl invites you to get invested in your players, it's almost an RPG: when that special team members gets wounded or dies, you'll cringe.

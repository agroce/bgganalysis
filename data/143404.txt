RATING: 7
Risk mitigation and a sense of hopelessness has always been a staple component of the Oniverse games, this one has both spilling out of it.  Like Sylvion just before it, the first level of play (The School of Architects: The Introductory Level) is terrible and incredibly difficult as you do not have any options for risk mitigation.

The Admiral's Academy: The Base Level, is where the game opens up and begins to shine.  With the options available it's now beatable and not really that difficult.

The final mode, The Menace: Expert Level, is where the game becomes crushingly difficult but amazing.  You really have to plan and there luck will play a factor.

A great solitaire game with solid components (though, not as amazing as Sylvion).

RATING: 6
Only soloed so far. There's not quite enough choice available to really make it super interesting, and the game can simply choose for you to lose via the luck of the draw, so it's probably just as well that the brain strain is pretty light. And I think that's intentional. It's meant to be light and fun, and to make you go, "Pshaw!", when a black bordered baddie appears. So I respect that it is accomplishing what it set out to.

But I don't think I will solo it very much beyond this, because going, "Pshaw!", by yourself isn't very amusing. It's when something silly like that happens, when you're with someone, that it's actually silly. So I am thinking that it might be a good, light two person game. And that is what I bought it for. We shall see.

UPDATE: I've now played a 2-player game and I do think it was much better. It doesn't really change the game at all, but the collaboration brings the final little oomph. Still not amazing, but pretty decent.

This game from the oniverse didn't "tilt" for me. 
The art is really limited, you need to read the rulebook all the time, and the game is really abstract. It's like a "tetris". Sure, the mechanics are OK, but this game feels blank for me. I won't sell it because I love the oniverse so much, but I would otherwise.

I've not met the Shadi Torbey design yet that isn't worth owning. Castellion is a fine companion to Sylvion and Onirim, in which you're building a 6x6 structure out of tiles and trying to manage defensive lines or blocks of 4 Defenders of the same faction. But the matching rules are a little tricky, and you've got to accomplish Exam cards and other goals to make it through. Three levels of difficulty come in the box, each with some variants, and the artwork is once again so unique and lovely, flush within the Oniverse. Outstanding for solo play and really reflects that strange feel you've gotten from the earlier titles. Can also play with two! Easily recommended whether you enjoy his other games or even puzzle video games.

Quick setup, short playtime. Production Quality is very good.
This is the only game from the Omniverse series that plays better with 2 players. Still a great solo game!

You have to draw tiles. If you don't like those games in general, you may want to NOT try this one.

It is the most random and difficult Oniverse game. 

You have 3 difficult level to master. The first level will teach you the bare basics, the second level is extending on it whereas the third level has different winning conditions and only takes the mechanics from the previous two levels.

I played about 5 games on beginner and about as many on the following level. It took me 2-3 games on the Expert level until I realised how good it was. It is quite different to the first two levels which caused some frustration on my side but it was worth it. 

It's really fun once you get down the strategy. Do I win every time like in Onirim ?? No. Certainly not. It is more random than other Oniverse games. You have quite a few options at hand to battle the "Traitor" Tiles but almost everything you can do comes at a high cost. Sometimes you can recover and sometimes you simple can not.

I like it because of that randomness. If you play Coop the game feels different enough and you will mitigate some of that randomness you have playing Solo.

Initial Impression: The artwork in this game is similar to the other games in the oniverse. A bit disappointed with the simplicity of the artwork in this particular game, I can understand that the tiles don't provide a large canvas with which to showcase the artstyle. The game is easy to set up and playtime is not long. The rules are super simple to remember and I can see this hitting the table more than the other oniverse games in my collection. I have yet to play higher than the architect level so really hope that the game has lots to offer. I enjoyed what I've experienced so far.

Not taking in consideration Urbion, which I didn't play yet, this one seems the weakest of the series; it's not bad, and it's quite well designed and balanced; the point is that the puzzle-solving aspect makes it more dry and mechanical; and this goes against the theme

Just one advice: move on from the basic version as soon as possible since there isn't much game in it (contrarily to the basic version of Sylvion, which I found quite enjoyable); this is for learning the basic mechanisms only and it shouldn't take more than 2 or 3 plays

Solo game. Tile placement.
Never tried the 2-played co-op variant, not that interested in trying either.

Cons:
Shuffleling tiles can be quite difficult. (And putting them in a bag *might* just use the tiles faster)
Which there was some instruction in the box telling us the way the tiles fit in the insert. Knowing that, I wouldn't have throw mine away.


Pros: 
Exp/variant included.
Ajustable difficulty.
Challenging.
Stunning packaging, like all its Oniverse sibblings.

Oniverse: I really love the puzzlely aspect of tile placement in this game. My ranking of this one according to the other really depends on my mood.

Amazing tile laying solitaire. Other designers would have stopped at the "base" level (level 2) of gameplay, but Shadi seems to go all out, with a great 3rd level, and many many variants. This is a spatial puzzle par excellence, with lots of nuances and probability juggling that become slowly apparent. All 3 levels are interesting and enjoyable to play. This one solidifies Oniverse as one of my favorite game series ever. The components are top notch, and the art is out of this world. 

Get this one.

This is an interesting puzzle, and I find myself playing it fairly often, but I don't know about its staying power.  There's not much variety in the obstacles, so it gets a bit repetitive, and there is only so much you can do to mitigate the luck of the draw.  A clever design, though.

The introductory game is terrible; you need the powers of the base game.  The introductory game is much harder than the base game because of this.  I haven't yet moved to the expert game.

I don't know if this has a permanent place in my collection or not.  What speaks in its favour, and what is true of all three Oniverse games, is that what it does, it does very well.  Solo experience, ~15 minutes or so.

Castellion is a solo game and a 2-player co-op game. It is a spatial puzzle game akin to Tetris. The objective of the game is to deal with 3 ordeals in an unknown amount of time. In the game you are drawing one tile at a time and deciding what to do with it before drawing the next. The tile you draw can be from the normal stack or the safe stack. In the normal stack are time tokens which when drawn do something bad. Usually, they will be counting down the time that you have to meet the requirements of the ordeal by having certain patterns in your arrangement of played tiles. You can draw from the safe stack and ensure no time tokens. The game comes with 3 levels of difficulty and a number of different variants to tailor the experience to your liking. I recommend only playing the intro game 1 - 2 times before getting into the normal difficulty. I say this because it means you have more decisions of what to do with your tiles. After having played a lot of Lumines on PSP (Playstation Portable), Castellion makes my mind go through similar thought patterns.

The packaging is lovely, as per the rest of the Oniverse games. The insert sucks. The insert that comes with the game is short and has to accommodate the punch boards. After punching the tiles out, the insert just doesn't work. How does it compare to other Oniverse games? Well, I haven't played the 2nd edition of Onirim. I did play the first edition and the amount of shuffling I had to do in each game of Onirim infuriated me. It was as if I was playing a deckbuilding game. It was fun if you don't mind that. I haven't played Urbion and know very little about it. I haven't played Sylvion, but it takes probably twice as long as the other games in the series. Additionally, it's a deck builder, which brings it down in my eyes. Castellion is probably the perfect Oniverse game for me and for now, I find it pretty enjoyable.

And this one is really clever. Again the mechanics are deceptively simple yet the game play is deep and engaging. There are plenty of little rules tweaks and optional variants to customise your game experience allowing you to adjust the difficult according to your preference.

Castellion offers another puzzly game from one of the more interesting solo game designers, Shadi Torbey.  As usual, the artwork of Elise Plessis sets the perfect tone for this fourth game in the Oniverse series.  The Introductory game is quite luck-dependent and players should really play it just to get used to get used to the fundamental mechanic.  The real game starts in the "base level" where the factions can be used for effects that help the player's objectives.  Like all Torbey's games, this is a strong exercise in luck management, but here it is with drawing tiles instead of cards.  So far, it appears nicely balanced.  I love how additional challenges (and "easy modes") are offered of cater to a range of player skill.  Sylvion might be my favourite, but Castellion takes 2nd place from Onirim.  Torbey is certainly a designer who can offer a variety of mechanics and neat design.  Castellion is no exception.

I didn't think anything would beat Onirim as a small, easy to put on the table,  solo game.  Castellion is becoming one of my favorite games of all time.  It's a simple looking little tile game that has enough choices and complexity to be a real challenge.  It's the first game I have rated a ten.  People who aren't into puzzle games might not like it as much as I do, but everybody in the family who has tried it has liked it.  In a collection full of card and dice based games, this one has me drawing tiles and filling out a grid.  There are a few basic rules that combine to make every choice matter.  The Oniverse has a real winner with this one!  It takes a bit more planning and tabl space than Onirim, but it's easier to get going than Nautilion and takes a much smaller footprint than Sylvion.  In a series where I like all four games as much as I do, I think I am about the only person that has this one at the top of my list.

Shadi Torbey strikes again with a small, beautiful, and thoughtful solo experience. Returning to an Onirim-esque game, Shadi takes to spatiality rather than hand-management this time and do so with good effect: you are required to manage the random tiles you draw and work with in order to productively conjoin them, use their special effect, and even make sure that you follow building code (i.e., a square room can't be next to another!). All in all, the more modules you add as you go, the greater the variety of meaningful choices you have with the tiles at your disposal, but at the cost of there being greater consequence and risk from the grape jelly Menace (i.e., the villain of this game).

While I might not enjoy this one as much as Sylvion (yet), it's already earned its keep. Plus, there's something absolutely magical about opening the box for the first time and being let into the Castellion.

Update - October 2016 - The advanced rules, plus the difficult Menace variant, and the pantry makes for one hell of a game which is rife with really interesting choices. The game is certainly not as simple as the "basic" advanced version might make it out to be! While I originally thought that this game was potentially the weakest of the Oniverse (i.e., too easy after a few plays), I take it back: it's just as good as its siblings.

I own and, mostly when traveling, play Torbey's first two designs, Onirim and Urbion. The games are essentially alternatives to playing Solitaire with a regular deck of cards. The difference is that there are actually decisions involved Torby's games, but the card shuffle still has a lot of say in how well you'll do. They are gamer's solitaire card games. The rules to his games can take a bit of getting used to, especially as you layer in additional modules and "expansions", which are included when you buy the games. But they scratch the itch when you just shuffle cards and play and not necessarily break out one of the myriad of more complex solo games.

Castellion switches from cards to tiles. Each turn you draw a title and add it to your tableau following some basic placement rules. You are trying to achieve patterns of shapes and colors according the three goal cards you've drawn before you've drawn too many many bad, unplace-able tiles. As you add modules for the moderate and expert games you have options to discard tiles for special effects to help you meet the ever-increasing requirements of the goals. Castellion has more of puzzle feel to it than a solitaire feel, and for that reason I like it a touch less than the other two, but I'm happy to have it with me when I need a break from the others.

Played the training game, and was intrigued by the puzzle element of playing the tiles. And then, after having graduated to the base game... my mind was even further blown. The unique powers from the four different "races" really add nicely to the complexity. Really enjoying this game more the deeper I go, and can't wait to see what the advanced game modes add.

I think there is a significant design flaw at the expert level. See my notes in my plays. I have had several games in a row in which I drew 5-8 traitor tiles in the first 20 draws. The result, since it is impossible to see the challenge you are facing, is that you end up destroying your castle every three rounds. Then you draw two black-bordered tiles and you lose. I generally have two games that end this way before I can get off to a decent start. Frustrating and flawed, in my opinion.

After a video review: Abstract but interesting castle defense game. Still, it's more a puzzle game than actually building defensive structures and fighting monsters.

from other user comments: the artwork and shapes around it is confusing. I agree with that when I saw the video, as a color blind person, it was somewhat confusing. Else there seems to be complaints about little replay value. All games seems the same even if there are different sets of challenges.

7.0 - Aug 2016 - 4 plays:  Rating inspired by [geeklist=212607][/geeklist].  At this point, I've only played the introductory and base level, so the rating should be tempered with that understanding.  The introductory level isn't very much fun, but it should be seen as only a stepping stone to get the basics of the rules under your belt.  There isn't enough control over the tiles drawn, so you're at the mercy of the draw to get your structures right.  Play it once or twice, then move on the the basic level.  The tile abilities provide much needed choices about what you should be doing on each turn.

I'm still a bit confused how I like this game. First: I love the solo-aspect and the art. I also like to puzzle, so this game is right up my alley. I also like the 3 difficulties: introductory to learn placement, base to learn the different abilities and expert to learn to work with the formations and closed Ordeal cards.

I think the 3 games are actually different: once you have your tiles placed at introductory, you cannot change it anymore (difficult part). 

The Base game actually feels the best and like a puzzle. It feels like the most flexible game and most in line with the Introductory game. Puzzling with the different abilities is fun.

The Expert game adds closed Ordeal cards and formation abilities. And Ordeal cards that don't make you lose the game (except for the Earthworm). It's possible to win the game by constructing bastions (2x2 squares). If you manage to get 9 bastions (build up towards the last Ordeal), you can get away with any Ordeal card... The Expert game lets you choose your strategy. The Ordeal cards don't dictate that anymore... Another layer of strategy so to speak...

But...

I missed a bag to hold the red tiles: shuffling them is hard. (a minor thing, I happened to have one spare 'dice bag'...)

I still feel the 'luck of the draw' is a major aspect. If you draw the 3 black bordered traitors at once in the beginning, you lost (and yes: that happened to me and that's frustrating). I think the hardest part is actually getting your castle started especially in the Expert game.

And why does the Base game miss an earthworm menace...? (Maybe an expansion...?)

...

I'm still in limbo: especially about the 'luck' part.

[u]10-Sep-2016[/u]:  This seemed right up my alley:  a solo-only, puzzly, tile-laying game in the Oniverse series.  Sadly, this did not click with me.  I see the strategies. I like the manipulation of the board. But there are a couple of warts in this I just don't want to live with...the main being the complete lack of a way to deal with Traitor tiles. The Nightmares in Onirim (the Traitor equivalent) have more options for their "use" as well as ways to avoid and cancel their effects. None of this is present in Castellion.

Well, I've come to the extremely disappointing conclusion that the Oniverse games (other than 1e Onirim) are just not for me.  :sigh:  Urbion, Sylvion, and now Castellion.  I mean really, this series of games should be the highlight of my collection. Sadly, I just have not found any significant enjoyment in any of the games beyond the original.

You direct the dream denizens of the castle at the centre of the Oniverse as they rush to mount a defence against waves of monsters attacking the castle, building towers to see what’s coming, keeps to minimize damage, and ranks to reduce the effects of the traitors found inside your walls, along with the special powers of the denizens themselves.

A cute and mechanically sound addition to the Oniverse series. Like its siblings, it's a good solo game and the tiles add a more tactile feel to it compared to Sylvion and Onirim. 

Castellion is a bit faster to set up and play than Sylvion, but if push came to shove, I'd probably prefer the latter simply because of its more juicy theme. Onirim is, due to its insane speed plus the app, the best of the trio.

Not as good as Onirim or Sylvion.  The expansions included in the box don't seem to contribute as much variety as the expansions in the other Oniverse games, hence the replay value is a bit limited.  Not a bad game, but I don't seem to be reaching for it very often.

Not sure how I feel about this one. All of Shadi's games have been top notch, but this one fell a bit flat. The rules are simple but it just felt more like matching up colors and shapes than anything. The castle aspect of the game is just a size and placement constraint.

I went into this with high hopes and so far I'm not super impressed. I've only played the intro game, but I'll be diving into the standard game soon.

My third Oniverse game of the year and I've liked them all. This one feels like a spatial reimagining of Onirim and it's a cute little puzzle. My only concern is that the ability to discard a traitor by destroying 4 tiles saps some of the tension. Destruction often seems like something you want to do to reconfigure your castle, rather than the unalloyed damage caused by a Nightmare in Onirim.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
When you are playing with all these pieces, you suddenly start to realize that the unknown random elements produced in the game can all be controlled and tamed using the various powers. You can expose the next four tiles and take them in any order, you can dig through the discard, and you can move tiles about, while using your formations to protect yourself and view the Menace's future forms. If you play smart, you can really juggle tiles about, and the sound of tiles being thrown in a clatter into the discard pile is very pleasing. This game really tickles me pink, and continues to maintain the Torbey streak of beautiful gaming. I suspect that the 2p form might be sorta weak, but I've seen that in previous games, and it's not necessary with such a satisfying 1p experience.

French review: https://comboteurfou.wordpress.com/2016/12/22/castellion-more-like-castel-non/

Tiles make this a chore to shuffle.
You can lose in the first few turns, which makes this terrible. Whatever happens in the three other Oniverse games, you can go to the end of the game. Here, you will have spent five minutes "shuffling", and then can lose in one minute, and there is not much you can do about it. This could have been solved by seeding the traitor tiles and black bordered tiles in certain portions of the draw pile.
There is not much replayability, as, sure, there are three different game levels with two to three variants each, but you're trying to build the same patterns each time, and the the tests are always the same, with mostly a variation in the numbers of formations you're trying to achieve. And the introductory game is so bland, and you can do so little, that you won't spend too much time on it anyway.

Good points :
- The artwork is still lovely
- At last, I can fit the game, sleeved, in its box!

Bad points :
- Tiles
- Spatial puzzle
- Low replayability
- Early losses
- Introductory game is boring and random

Very random.

I loved Sylvion and was hoping for another gem, but this one was not it.  There is a lot of luck in how the tiles are shuffled, and you can easily have lost before you even being without knowing it.  When that doesn't happen, the game is still not to my taste, as it is mostly front-loaded planning, not heuristic tactical plays.  There is also no real replayability -- every game is the same, and the variation of the patterns you need to make does not make the game unfold differently.

If you want a surreal solo game with this style of art, or indeed if you want any solo game, go play Sylvion instead!

This is a really fun tile laying / puzzle game that plays really well solo and 2 player, though I mostly play solo. It's not too complex, and luck can really ruin it for you, and will eventually become a bit monotonous, which is why I've rated it so. However, I really enjoy the puzzle and challenges. One thing to make sure of is that the two training levels are more guidelines to teach rather than beat, as I've had more wins against the "hardest" level than the other two due to luck of the draw (for me it's VERY difficult-and part of the fun- to build one set of structures, then completely destroy my work to build completely different sets)

About [thing=143404][/thing]:

[b]1) What is it?[/b]
[thing=143404][/thing] is a tile-laying game in which one or two players (cooperatively) are trying to build a magic fortress - the Castellion - to resist to the attack of the Menace. In order to do this, the player is required to make special constructions: line of defense (4 tiles in a horizontal line), tower (4 tiles in a vertical line) and the bastion (a 2x2 square).

[thing=143404][/thing] allows for three levels of play: School of Architects, which is the introductory level. At this point, the goal is simply to make the formations before the time runs out. Admiral's Academy, which is the base level, and in here the tiles, when discarded, trigger effects - the time to build the defensive formations ir shorter, and there are more required forms. The expert level is The Menace itself - in here, the player doesn't even know, at first, what she is facing: the requirements are face down, and only when towers are built, one is flipped face up. The three different types of constructions now have uses: the towers reveal the Ordeal cards; the lines of defense reduce the effect of Traitors; and the bastions reduce the effect of failing to meet the Ordeal needs. In the Menace level is also the only level where the goal isn't to fully build the required formations: the goal is to survive the attack while still having a complete foundation for the Castellion.

[thing=143404][/thing] is very easy to play, even when adding new variants (the game comes with one for each level) or rasing in level. The building is done fast, and a whole play usually stays in around 15 to 20 minutes (is possible to lose faster, but to win, rarely). The rules are presented in a fine manual, colorful and well explained.

As expected, [thing=143404][/thing] is part of the Oniverse, the same of [thing=71836][/thing], [thing=94389][/thing] and [thing=143405][/thing], all of the same designer - Shadi Torbey - and with the same illustrator: the amazing Élise Plessis.

[b]2) How do you play?[/b]
Simple: decide a level. Took the exam/simulation/assault (the name differ, but the use is the same) cards for it. Take randomly one I , one II and one III ordeal card. These are what you need to do in order to win.

In her turn, the player simply takes one tile, revealing it and using it or discarding it. In the Admiral's Academy level and the Menace level, discard a tile trigger effects.

There are four rules for building:
1) Each tile, after the first, must be placed orthogonally to another;
2) With the exception of the 6 tiles that make the foundation of the Castellion, all tiles must have a tile directly beneath it;
3) With the exception of the 6 tiles that make the foundation of the Castellion, tiles of the same shape (there are three shapes: square, triangle and circle) cannot be placed adjacent;
4) The fortress can be bigger than 6x6 tiles.

Because of these rules, tiles will often needed to be discared, even without effect, due to the restrictions.

Each exam/simulation/assault card has an ordeal requirement on it (what the player must do - for instance: have the Castellion with 2 towers and 2 bastions) and a number of Traitor tiles it can have: when a Traitor tile is revealed, the player have two options: discard it, destroying 4 tiles of the Castellion, or placing it on the current exam/simulation/assault card. In the introductory level (School of Architects), only placing the Traitor is possible. Once a exam/simulation/assault card has the same number of Traitor tiles as depicted on the card itself, the ordeal (requirement) of it must be faced - either the player has fulfilled the ordeal, in which case the game continues (or is won, if that was the III card) or the player must pay an amount of tiles (in the Menace level) or the game is simply lost (in the other two levels and in the Menace, if the amount of tiles destroyed is enough to make the Castellion doesn't have a complete foundation).

That is it. Take a tile, place it or discard it. Play goes until all three ordeals are done by the player, in which case she wins; or until one isn't and the player can't pay the amount of tiles, in which case she loses). Simple, right?

[b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b]
In the introductory level (School of Architects) there are few: either take a tile from the normal tiles or from safe tiles (there are only 12 of these). With a tile, decide where to place it (considering what formations are needed in the ordeals requirements). Discard is a decision not often done, usually only happening when the placing of it would make a formation harder (or impossible) to be done.

In the base level (Admiral's Academy) there are many more decisions to be done throughout the play by the addition of two rules: the option of discarding a Traitor tile by destroying 4 tiles of the Castellion; and that each faction tile, when discarded, triggers an effect, which are:
- Juggler: change the position of 2 orthogonally adjacent tiles;
- Chameleon: recover one tile, with the same shape of the Chameleon, from the discard pile and immediately add it to the Castellion, following the normal placement rules;
- Seer: reveal 4 tiles and place them in the order you choose;
- Pyro: has 2 effects: a) destroy one tile anywhere in the Castellion (if there are tiles above it, they fall to fill the gap); b) choose a tile a place it somewhere else on the Castellion, following the normal placement rules, except 3 (same shapes can't be placed adjacent - with the Pyro power they can).

These makes for a ton of possibilities while playing, as not only adding them is important, but they can be even more key if discarded. After one or two plays in the introductory level, pass to the base level and never return.

Finally, in the Menace level, the defensive formations have uses,  however, most of the time, except for the need to make a Tower as soon as possible, all the formations will mostly be done to meet the required ordeal, and not for the benefit they bring, which is just a bonus.

Overall, the set of decisions made rises when increasing the level, and is already good in the base level, with the expert level not bringing more choices, but mostly more difficulty.

[b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b]
- Excelent art and production value (on par with [thing=71836][/thing] and [thing=156336][/thing] - same size box, forming a neat set);
- Very portable and can be played in an airplane tray;
- High replay value, considering three levels of play (but only two with some staying power), several variants, and it comes with one expansion (the Pantry);
- Quick playing time, allowing for multiple plays in a row;
- Nice amount of decisions once in the base or expert level - light enough for a low stress play, and important enough for them to actually matter;
- Although is mostly a solo player game, it has rules for 2 persons, playing cooperatively, for all the levels of play.

[b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b]
- A good deal of luck (of the draw), which can bother players that want more control over the result (and the introductory level is almost all luck) - plays can be decided by the draw, especially to lose;
- The game could use (and has room for it) a draw bag for the tiles.

[b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b]
Not as building or defending a fortress, not even in the least. [thing=143404][/thing] is almost an abstract game, having just a tad more theme than [thing=71836][/thing] and [thing=94389][/thing], and less than [thing=143405][/thing]. In [thing=143404][/thing] you are building to fill demands - you are like bricklayer with a quota to fill. You are not even building the whole fortress: just the protective wall - no rooms, corridors, internal buildings, nothing of this sort. Just walls, towers and bastions - important, sure, but you can't even make a star-shaped wall, or a circular one, or one inside other. And while Castellion itself is a shape-shifting fortress, the overall format of it isn't.

While I might making it sound bad, [thing=143404][/thing] isn't a bad game. It is good, light and fun to play - there is even tension, hoping for some proper tiles while praying for a Traitor to not show up. Still, in no way you will truly feel like in a battle against something other than Chance. [thing=143404][/thing] is more [thing=822][/thing] and [thing=6249][/thing] than [thing=45986][/thing] or even [thing=43443][/thing].

In the end, in its family, [thing=143404][/thing] stays ahead of [thing=71836][/thing] and [thing=94389][/thing] in my preference, since in [thing=143404][/thing] you build something, and I'm a sucker for games that have this, being also quicker than both and have less opaque decisions (in base and expert level) than either of these, as three of the four powers of the factions affect the Castellion directly, so you can see what you will do and the result of it. While it do needs a little more space to play than [thing=71836][/thing], it isn't by much - it can also be played in an airplane tray. The weight of [thing=143404][/thing] is slightly more than [thing=71836][/thing] and [thing=94389][/thing], and bellow  [thing=143405][/thing].

Even with the fact that luck can decide games (however, that is why the small playing time helps to prevent too much frustration), [thing=143404][/thing] goes recommend, not only for those that want to "complete the set" of Oniverse games, but also for anyone looking for a quick to play and easy to play tile-laying game, with a small footprint, that can be easily be stored and be taken anywhere. Not a perfect game, but good enough to be included in many collections, even for those people that don't often play solo games.

A game where you are constructing a castle out of tiles randomly drawn, trying to build certain defensive formations before the traitors force you to face an ordeal. After my first plays on the Beginner level, I was not crazy about this game, but once I moved on to the base level, that is where the fun starts. I would recommend just starting on Intermediate. Definitely don't judge the game based on Beginner because it doesn't include the defender tile powers of Base/Expert or the defensive formation powers of Expert, which make it a great game, in my opinion.

Damn, Castellion is cute. Onirim is probably still the best of the Omniverse lot, in the strictest sense of an evolving game, with it's expansions giving it some real changes & challenges & more divergent thinking to ride out. 

Castellion has a pleasure that is hard to pin down. Why do I like it? Definitely easier, and a bit more of a random throwdown if you want to skate hard in one direction instead of taking proper caution. So, it's mood savvy. Cutest thing I've ever seen for a quick spell of tile grubbing, no set-up time, 15 minute puzzle solving. Even cuter than Ornirim & Sylvion. But I can't really recommend it because... how do you recommend a solo game? It'll always come with a '...but I don't play solo' caveat & a little self-reflective crisis. Nobody wants THAT!!
 
Right now I will grab Castellion before the others. It's more lite & fluid. I tossed the insert & have a draw bag for the tile pulls, which I really recommend as it gives it speed get going (instantly) & that last aesthetic nudge, both which lend itself to taking a blind run at the hidden goals rather than thoughtfully exposing them first, which is fun, like driving too fast, because it's that much speedier and 'what the hell." whereas Onirim & Sylvion have larger commitments to a session. 

But can you bring yourself to throw away that insert? That can give a gamer ANOTHER anxious crisis. ;)

Castellion is all about building patterns into a defined grid while avoiding locked positions and triggers to destructive forces.  Each play is varied and requires planning beyond a move or two.  

The randomness of the tile draw may create an early game loss but it is better to let this happen and easily restart than to fight too hard against it only to play into a protracted loss.

While I find Castellion engaging and fun I also think it is too random and puzzle themed to ever have a place as a T1 game for me.

 A fun tile laying game that forces you to plan ahead and make surprisingly tough choices due to the uncertain nature of even the safe tile draws. 

I have also had the chance to play it cooperatively and found it very enjoyable. The best cooperative experience in the Oniverse line.

Tricky little tile laying game where you need to plan 3 rounds ahead so you don't block yourself in. Very constricting on the starter level. The intermediate level gives powers to play with to mitigate blocking in but is much harder.

My favorite Oniverse title. Feels video-gamey. Every once in a while you run into a few tiles that end your game almost immediately, but most plays are really interesting. You'll want to throw a bag in the box for the tiles. 

Edit: I'm so sad to lower this. I tried to give this a 100 play challenge but I ran out of game to play around the 20-something mark. It's still a good solo game, but it doesn't warrant a purchase if you intend to play it a lot.

Single player (coop variant) abstract tile placing castle defense strategy puzzle. Face three progressively difficult challenges by matching tile combinations within your 6x6 castle grid. Each tile represents a room and a creature to add with certain placement restrictions.  Build formations like a base, tower, or bastion or use the creature special ability to manipulate the tiles like seers, jugglers or pyros in round, square or triangle rooms. Reminds me of Candy Crush in slow motion. Simple play rules to random draw-and-place a tile or be forced to advance the countdown timer for the next challenge.  Rounds start simple but ramps up into some decent spatial problem solving later. My favorite of the oniverse games so far.

I was very surprised by how much fun it was to play the cooperative two player game. This fact definitely pushed me over the edge, and made me decide to buy all the Oniverse titles. Since then I've played this a bunch solitaire.

The advanced game is much more fun here than the basic version, but even that has its points. It teaches you the basics in an interesting, and seemingly random manner. That is, the game seems to be completely lacking of skill, but that's not the case, it's a matter of learning to see the matrix. Good fun.

The Player Aid by Christianv in the files section is essential for this game.

This game is excellent, and really makes me want to try obtaining the other Oniverse games. I'm still pretty new at it, but what I've seen so far is a really unique experience. It's a challenging puzzle, forcing you to use what information you have to try and make the best decisions. Do you discard your drawn tile to use it's special ability, which can effect the placement of the next tile, or do you try to place it and hope you don't cut yourself off from success at some crucial juncture? Great decisions. Would definitely recommend.

Very tactical with 2, but most enjoyable with 3.  The tension and added chaos just makes it a lot of fun.  Totally too chaotic with 4, but still fun enough.  I really like the game with all it silliness.  Vogel has impressed me twice now.

Bon, ça suffit avec les romains. Entre Nations et Praetor, ils se sentent tout permit. On va donc les renvoyer un peu chez eux. Prenez vos barbares, et balancez-les sur les forts romains, un peu au style de quelques irréductibles gaulois. Tout cela risque d'être un peu chaotique, mais qui a dit que les barbares étaient disciplinés?

A microgémek reneszánszában egy újabb példány, ezúttal még a stíluson belül is a könnyedebb fajtából. Talán leginkább micro libertáliának nevezném. Ez alapján nem kéne annyira rossznak lennie, de szerintem még a libertáliánál is káoszosabb. Képtelenség előre megtervezni, hogy mi fog történni a 7 kártya alatt az adott körben, de olyannyira, hogy szerintem ha random pakolgatnék, akkor is ugyanannyi esélyem lenne. Kár érte, mert az ötlet jó. Viszont annyira rövid, hogy súlytalan fillerként, még így is elő tudhat kerülni azokra az üres 10 percekre.

This is a game of putting down your cards in rows, while bidding for certain prizes/castles. The cards are turned over, have a value and interact via the special abilities. The result is total chaos, but it is short enough, so this can be fun for sometimes.

Nice, quick little filler where you program out your hand for the round, essentially bidding on each card in order. The cards have abilities as well, and there's some double-think going on as well as a chance for the one who gets saddled with the negative cards to win.

I don't like the randomness of pre-programmed actions in games and found this too chaotic to be a favourite but fortunately the game plays quickly. Liked the theme but not the cartoon artwork, and am tired of seeing the same style of goofy illustrations on games in an attempt to make the game look fun.

RATING: 7
What a pleasant surprise in a small packet. Array 6 forts (ie VP cards) down the middle of the table. Each player has an identical deck of 9 cards, and each round draws 7 of those and keeps 6, arraying them in the order they want to play them. Simultaneously reveal the first, and the high card wins the fort. In a neat twist, the others don't discard, but add their losing card to the next simultaneous reveal. And so on, winning the next fort along after each reveal, with the winner discarding all their winning cards and re-setting their count. This makes for much interest in working out what forts you're aiming to win, and trying to lose the forts just before it so you'll have enough on the table to win the one you want. But of course, others might be trying the same! Additionally, each of the cards has a special power when revealed, which adds further decisions about how to array. Once you know your cards, it soon becomes all about the meta, out-guessing the other guessers! You can't play any perfect type of game as you're always missing 2 of your deck. All the decision making is up-front in forming the array, and then the fun part is the revelation with consequent cheers and groans. Play 3 rounds and add up the VPs! It may be too repetitive to play back-to-back, but it's otherwise a very neat filler which plays in a perfect time frame.

A passing comment by a geekbuddy made Romans Go Home! sound like the kind of thing I'd like, and favourable reviews from Bruno Faidutti and Shannon Applecline put me over the edge. I've played three times so far and it's a neat little filler. Kind of reminds me of the doublethink of Seiji Kanai's R but with the addition of pre-programming of moves. Tiny box too!

This is a quick game...it did takes us about three plays to figure out the rules, I will warn.  Once we had the rules down, it was pretty easy and fast.  Not the best game, but decent.  It is very small, though, and quick, which is never a bad thing. Good filler category game. (JW)

RATING: 5
Pre programme six of your nine cards, then simultaneously reveal each in turn as you "fight" over six forts in a round. Special abilities on most of the warrior cards mix things up. Special abilities on some of the forts mix things up. So it's blind bidding mixed with randomness upon randomness. Which is not as bad as it sounds, but not much better either. Mercifully it's short - about 10 minutes. Not really my sort of game, but some people might get a kick out of this sort of light affair. Too light and too random for me.

This is a really clever micro-game on par with Love Letter or Coup. It has some bluffing and misdirection elements, but unlike many of these games every player has access to the same pool of cards, so getting a bad hand doesn't dictate your actions.

I think this one would have a good shot in the current gaming scene if it was picked up by a bigger publisher. It needs a re-theme and a complete redo of the artwork, because make no mistake, it's dreadful. Like Glory To Rome bad. No, it's even worse than that.

Seriously.

This is a great, light, filler game that plays as well with 2-4 players. It is silly, unpredictable, easy-to-teach and fast to play. I like the opposing scoring methods, which creates the game's underlying tension.

It's nothing deep or overly-strategic but it isn't meant to be. You can really try to get into the other players' heads if you like and attempt desperately to out-think them...or you can just place your cards down and see what happens.

Glad I picked this one up and it was absolutely worth the few bucks I paid for it.
